   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By ouentin Poel in Bonn. Lura Sllbwr in Belgradeg and Edward Mortimer in London DIVISIONS IN the European Community over how to respond to the crisis in Yugo- slavia.wmil come to a head on Thursday when the West Euro. pean Union will meet to con- sider sending a peacekeeping force to separate Serbs and Croats involved in the escalat- ing civil war. The WEU will meet in The Hague to discuss a Dutch pro- posal to send an intervention force to Yugoslavia. The move appears to be a response to pressure from Bonn for stron- ger west European action on the Yugoslav crisis. But other WEU and EC member states do not appear to be ready to back either the des- patch of peacekeeping troops or early recognition of embat- tled Croatia's independence. The idea of a peacekeeping force was rejected last night by Serbia's foreign minister, Mr Vladimir Jovanovic. The decision to discuss an intervention force at talks in The Hague was arinpunued after Lord Carrlngtp, chair- man of the EC -peaq; cooifer ence, arrived in ,Yugc Ilav for talks with Mr Franjo Timan, president of Croatia,Slo dan Milosevic, president of Serbia, and General Veljko Kadijevic, the Yugoslav federal defence minister, The moves came against the background of some of the heaviest clashes in almost three months of fighting in Yugoslavia. Croatian forces used mortars and heavy artillery in battles with Serbian guerrillas and the Yugoslav army throughout the republic, taking the death toll since Saturday over 40. Air-raid sirens wailed twice as airforce jets flew low over the Croatian capital Zagreb and an army general said he could not rule out that the city would be bombed. The federal army vowqd to take \"decisive action\" to raise the siege round their barracks on the Adriatic coastline. Last night the army claimed to have destroyed Croatian units block- ing an airforce base near Zadar on the coast. Earlier, Croatian radio reported two federal airforce jets had been shot down after they strayed into Hungarian airspace. Mr Ante Markovic, Yugoslav prime minister, said his coun- try was unable to solve the conflict alone and called on the EC and other international organisations to step up peace efforts. \"Without foreign support, without the support of the EC, we are not capable of halting the war, nor are we capable of keeping it under control,\" he The WEU meeting has been called in response to the urgent pleading of the German government, and in particular of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, for the west Europeans to step up their intervention in the cri- sis. In spite of superficial agree- ment on strategy, the debate within the EC has become increasingly divided between Germany, which sees Croatia as an embattled nation state fighting for survival, and Britain, France and the Nether- lands, which insist that the Community must be seen to be even-handed between Serbia and Croatia. The decision to call the WEU appears to have been made by Mr Hans van den Broek, Dutch foreign minister, as host, and Mr Genscher, as chairman, on the spur of the moment yester- day afternoon. It was not men- tioned when Mr Genscher rang Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign sec- retary, earlier in the day. British officials reacted very cautiously to the Dutch initia- tive, stressing that Britain was not committed to contribute to any peacekeeping force and had made no contingency plans to do so. Mr John Major, the prime minister, \"would have to think long and hard\" before undertaking any such commitment, one official said. British ministers and offi- cials praised Mr Van den Broek's efforts, but have been intensely irritated by the atti- tude of Mr Genscher, who they feel is pushing the EC towards a military intervention in which Germany itself would be neither able nor willing to con- tribute. The meeting follows an angry and divisive gathering of EC political directors last week when Germany was virtually isolated, both in its refusal to condemn Croatia for escalating the conflict by cutting the oil pipeline to Belgrade, and in pressing for early recognition of Croatian independence. A Dutch official said the WEU meeting should investi- gate sending peacekeeping troops as quickly as possible.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Jane Fuller HANSON, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, yes- terday made a recommended Â£351.4m takeover offer for Bea- zer, Britain's fourth largest housebuilder and the owner of Koppers, the second biggest US aggregates producer. The bid brought to a halt Beazer's planned flotation of CHB Group, comprising its operations in the UK and else- where in Europe. The path- finder prospectus was pub- lished only last week. The price is little more than a third of the $1.72bn (then worth Â£943m) that Beazer paid in 1988 to take over Koppers. Although Beazer sold periph- eral businesses, the Koppers deal remained the main source of its Â£lbn-plus debt. Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries, in which Hanson bought a 2.8 per cent stake in May, fell by 37p to I,267p yes- terday because of market spec- ulation that Hanson was no longer interested in a bid. But a senior Hanson adviser said: \"Lord Hanson [the com- pany's chairman] was disap- pointed to hear that ICI's shares had fallen. The Beazer deal does not affect any major transactions under review.\" Although Lord Hanson first put the deal to Mr Brian Bea- zer, chief executive of Beazer, on Friday night, his advisers said he planned the takeover more than three months ago. If the deal is accepted by Beazer's shareholders, Mr Beazer will remain in charge of the US aggregates business for Han- son. Hanson will inherit Bea- zer's Â£1.2bn debt pushing its overall debt close to Â£9bn, against its Â£7.6bn cash. Lord Hanson's advisers said the debt could be easily absorbed for two main reasons: * Hanson would be in a much stronger position to negotiate new borrowing terms for Bea- zer. Mr Martin Taylor, Han- son's vicebhairman, said: \"We hope there will be a meeting of minds with Beaser's bankers on what we both wish to achieve.\" *Although Hanson said it planned to extend Beazer's British operations, a break-up of CHB into constituent pruts would be likely to realise much more than the 2500m Bener hoped to get ftm the flotatloL.

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smh anmd Ian Hamilton Fasy MR NEIL KINNOCK dismissed suggestions yesterday that he was a liability to the Labour party and should stand down from the leadership, as he repeated his call for an election by early November. Speaking in Birmingham, where he addressed the West Midlands CBI, he said ques- tions about whether he should resign were \"absurd\". He shrugged off two week- end polls giving the Conserva- tives a lead of up to 5 percent- age points, saying: \"We'd like to be ahead but we are still in a strong position.\" Labour has also suffered a setback in Scotland, according to a poll showing its support there dropping from 48 per cent in May to 43 per cent. The survey, conducted by ICM for The Scotsman and the BBC, found that support for the Tories and the Scottish National party had risen slhdly - putting them on 25 and 19 pe cnRft*rseil.

Mr Peter Llley, trade and industry secretary, came out strongly against a November election. He said that, while busines confidence had risen sharply during the summer, the gov- ernment would do better to wait ibr trends to become well- established. \"I have always been a spring man, or even a summer oatioen eO PageU SKinnock Continud from Page 1 man.

We must allow con- fidence to get back into the system. I would like to see that building into next year,\" he added. Mr Liley is believed to be among miisters who believe that the outcome of an autumn election is at present too unpedictable for the govern- meut to risk. With economic ioafito moving in the rigt directio, waiting could only hpmove chane. Downing Street made it dear that, although the prime minis- ter would review the situation, Mr Mador had \"a great deal of work to do\" in the coming months, particularly in prepa- ration for December's uro- pean summit in Maastricht.

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington THE US has drawn up plans to send armed multinational escorts into Iraq to provide military muscle for United Nations inspection teams seek- ing access to Baghdad's ballis- tic missile sites. Acting under the umbrella of the UN, the US along with Britain and other allies, aims to issue an ultimatum to Presi- dent Saddam Hussein this week - unless Iraq allows the UN teams to fly helicopters on aerial inspections of suspected nuclear and unconventional weapons sites. The urgency in Washington stems directly from President George Bush who is due to deliver a keynote foreign pol- icy speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on Monday. Mr Bush views Iraqi defiance of the UN inspectors and of the UN's own ceasefire terms as a critical challenge to the credibility of the organisa- tion, a US official said. Iraq yesterday sought to defuse the confrontation, offer- ing to allow flights by UN heli- copters inside its airspace. However, it warned that heli- copters should not compromise Iraq's national security, in par- ticular insisting that they should not fly over certain parts of Baghdad. Diplomats believed that the latter stipula- tion was prompted by fear of a possible attack on Mr Saddam. Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the UN, gave the assurances to this month's president of the Secu- rity Council, Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee of France. Mr Meri- mee said that, although the Iraqi response \"is not totally negative, it is not totally satis- factory either\". Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador to the UN, yester- day informed other members of the UN Security Council of the US plan to force Iraq to comply with Resolution 707. This calls for Iraq to provide \"full, final and complete disclosure of all aspects of its programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction\". The US, Britain and other unnamed countries would be ready to dispatch armed escorts - believed to include aircraft - to protect the UN teams which have been in Iraq since the ceasefire resolutions were adopted after the end of the Gulf war. CinnHnMd an Page 22 Coninedon ar 2 UN teams Cntinud from Pae 1 This course of action iu viewed as preferable to selective bomb- ing of Iraqi sites since it can be justified as enforcing UN reso- lutions. Renewed military action would be more contre versial and could damage other US goals such as a Middle East peac e oen e. The UN teams have been seeking access to Iraqi chemi ca, nclear, biological and bea stic mie sites. Their tas as made more difficult after it was disclosed that Iraq's cnacear weapons capability Mas Vnch mMre advanced and adendhe than fit thought. Isal newaspape have regu- larly denounced the work of the last nuclear inspection team, charging that its goals were political and that the requested use of helicopters was an unacceptable breach of haqi soereignty. Mr Brent Scowcroft, Mr Bush's national security adviser, said at the weekend t*at the US would not rule out using troops if Iraq failed to amply with existing UN resc lutions. \"We're looking at it, and we take it very seriously, he said, \"and we think it is important that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the &ecrity Crrnel\"",

Mr Yavlinsky, who is also a deputy chairman of the emer- gency committee which is run- ning the faltering Soviet econ- omy, said the hardest work lay ahead. Republican leaders have yet to conclude specific agree- ments on issues such as man- aging hard currency resources and devising common mone- tary and pricing policies. Lloyd in Moscow Mr Yavlinsky told Soviet television that the main con- flict was no longer between republics and the centre, but between the short-term requirements of \"current poll- tics\" and the need for an eco- nomic strategy. The economic union project foresees a banking union, a common currency and a free flow of goods and services on what is becoming increasingly divided territory. It also sets out equal rights for all businesses in republics which sign the treaty; a rapid transition to free prices for most products; and a common labour market which would include an end to the propiska system under which citizens need permits to move resi- dence. The State Co4uncil, which includes the leaders of all republics except Georgia, Mol- dova and the independent Bal tic states, was also tol thai Soviet food production, falling W at an annual rate of 12 per cent, was now causing a 'very dangerous sittiation\". Mr Yuri Luzkhov, chief exec- utive of Moscow city council who is also a co-chairman of the edonomic committee, said production had dropped 8.5 per cent in the first eight months of the year and that the fall was gathering speed. Mr Luzkhov is to visit Lon- don and Brussels as part of Moscow's drive to secure sub- stantial westrn lfood Oid.

   "text_content" : "MR Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, has given the first sign that republics other than Russia wish to retain nuclear weapons on their territories, writes John Lloyd. In an interview with the US ABC televi- sion network Mr Nazarbayev said Kazakh- stan would keep nuclear weapons and insist on joint control over their use. \"Kazakhstan has received nuclear weapons and should keep them in future. We cannot allow other republics, even the largest of them, to control nuclear weap- ons on our soil,\" he said in the interview on Sunday night. His comments do not appear to indicate any intention to possess an independent nuclear force - only to share control with the Soviet, or Russian, authorities. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has said Russia is willing to take all nuclear weapons on to its territory - a stance which is beginning to raise fears among its neighbours. In remarks yesterday during a joint news conference with Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, Mr Namrbayev said the USSR should have a single system of defence, but emphasised that nuclear mis- silea should be under the collective con- trol of all republics. The remarks represent a shift of posi- tion by the Kazakh president, who had said he wished the republic to be a nucle ar-free zone, and has banned nuclear test- ing. They prompt fears that Ukraine - whose present position is that it, too, wishes to be a nuclear-free zone - will feel impelled to follow suit. Thousands of Kiev residents and representatives from other regions in the republic gather in support of Ukraine's Act of Independence, proclaimed by parliament",

   "text_content" : "By. David Buchan in Brussels THE European Commission received its first separate request for food aid from an individual Soviet city yester. day, just as Mr Jaques Delors, the Commission president, was extolling the virtues of EC- style economic and political integration to a group of econ- omy ministers from Soviet republics. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg (for- merly Leningrad), sent Brus- sels a letter asking for 20,000 tonnes of butter, 15,000 tonnes of milk powder and 50,000 tonnes of meat to tide the Soviet Union's second largest city through the winter. The Commission said St Petersburg's request appeared to be in addition to last week's call for Ecu5bn-Ecu6bn (Â£3.5bn-Â£4.2bn) worth of food aid which had ostensibly been made on behalf of all Soviet republics by Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, but which Ukrainian ministers subsequently told EC officials that they had not been con- sulted about. Mr Yuri Lushkov, responsi- ble for agriculture on the four- man Committee for the Man- agement of the Economy which is headed by Mr Silayev, is due in Brussels later this week to justify the food aid request to the Commission. EC officials say they want to know whether the plea for 5.5m tonnes of grain and large quantities of meat, to be deliv- ered over the next nine months, takes account of bilat- eral barter deals already made by Moscow, and how the request to the EC tallies with a similar plea to Mr John Major, British premier, who is presid- ing over Group of Seven studies on Soviet aid. * Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday urged the republics of the Soviet Union to agree quickly on a solid con- stitutional framework, George Graham adds from Washing- ton. Without such an agreement, he said after holding talks with President George Bush in Washington, it was impossible for the west to discuss helping the Soviet Union through eco- nomic aid or debt relief. The German chancellor repeated that his country had reached the limit of its aid resources, and called on Japan to provide more financial help to the Soviet Union.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Dresder DEPUTY finance ministers from the Group of Seven indus- trialised countries have suggested G7 finance ministers should get together before the IMF meeting in Bangkok next month to discuss aid to the Soviet Union. Officials said the delegates, who met at the weekend in Dresden, also suggested that G7 aid should be primarily technical, rather than sinan- cial. The US is believed to favour direct dealings with individual Soviet republics, rather than the central government in Moscow. Mr Nicholas Br6dy, US Treasury secretary, has said he favours the attendance in Bangkok of Soviet represen- tatives to discuss the economic situation in the Soviet Union. * Western industrialised countries must lift trade barri- ers to goods from east Europe in the interests of both sides, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of Germany's Bund- esbank, said yesterday. \"We have to do more than we have so far to remove trade barriers,\" he said after chair- ing a meeting of the OECD's Working Party Three, which monitors world economic and exchange rate trends. Mr Tietmeyer said the OECD committee, on which there was broad agreement on the trade issue, did not deal specifically with the question of direct assistance to the Soviet Union.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkidn in Paris MRS Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, yesterday unveiled a package of tax br'aks and investment incen- tivs for small business,.part of eot to curb unemployment, one of the government's big- gest headaches. 'Te main points of the fFrbn (Â£1.2b) scheme, pres- epted at a meeting of France's main small business organisa- tioni in Bordeaux, include: SA reduction in corporation tax fok all businesses. * The introduction for the first time of tax deductions for small companies raising new capital. * More state subsidised loans at lower interest rates and steps to make it cheaper for small businesses to incorporate as limited liability companies. The package drew an imme- diate attack from the Patronat, the French employers' associa- tion, which accused Mrs Cres- son of \"deception\". Mr Francois Perigot, presi- dent of the organisation, said the assistance on offer was \"not up to what was at stake\". It failed to tackle high obliga- tory social security deductions, which he estimated cost French businesses FFr400bn a year more than their German counterparts, and ignored sev- eral of the Patronat's demands. Mrs Cresson's scheme recalls the small business incentives launched by the UK in the 1980s, also an attempt to create jobs. Government officials said it was the first stage in a French industrial policy pro- gramme which would include proposals to stimulate profes- sional training and the announcement of candidates for partial privatisation, to be tabled by the end of the year. France's twin rates of corpo- ration tax - 34 per cent on retained earnings and 42 per cent on distributed profits - are to converge on the lower rate. Small businesses will pay 33.3 per cent next year, while ahl companIes will be taxed at 34 paer cent from 198. This will cost the Treasury FFr6.2bn next year, but it hopes to get most of that back Sby raising te tax on compa- nes' fnancial investment gains from 25 per cent to .338 per cent. The main innovation would allow smll companies to wriite off against corporation tax a quarter of the value of a capi- tal increase, on condition the fresh capital is worth at least a quarter of the existing equity. * The French annual inflation rate fell to about 3 per cent last month, from 3.4 per cent in July, according to provisional figures released yesterday by Insee, the state statistics body. The monthly rate slowed to between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent in August, against 0.4 per cent in the previous month, continuing to widen the gap against the higher Ger- man rate.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Boi THE Treuhand privatisation agency has asked the Bonn government to seek urgent European Commission approval for plans to restruc- ture east Germany's crumbling shipbuilding industry. Despite rationalisation mea- sures already taken, the Treu- hand's governing council says the \"most far-reaching support possible\" is still necessary if the Baltic yards are to be sold either to management or out- side investors. The Industry Ministry, which is to be briefed this week on the condition of the shipyards and the aid they need, is expected to contact Brussels early next month. The appeal suggests that, as with other core industries in the east, the Treuhand is hav- ing diffculties finding bidders prepared to buy into neglected heavy industries and bear the costs of restructuring. It indi- cates concern in the agency that the scale and type of sub- sidies needed could breach EC regulations. Uncertainties over develop- ments further east are also deterring bidders: three-quar- ters of the yards' output tradi- tionally goes to the Soviet Union. There is more at stake than the future of Deutsche Maschi- nen-und Schitfbau (DMS), the umbrella concern embracing 24 formerly state-owned enter- prises. According to Mr Bernd Heydrich, leader of the DM8 works council, shipbuilding is the backbone of the economy in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and its loss will spell the death of all the state's industry. West German shipbuilders have been through a painful shake-out since 1975, halving capacity from 1.5m gross tons and reducing their workforce from 78,000 to less than 30,000. They seem to have no stomach for going through the process again with DMS, which, despite sacking more than 10,000 in the past year, still employs 40,000. The Treuhand has also run WHOLESALE prices in west Germany fell In August for the first time in four months, offering more com- fort to government and Bundesbank authorities eager to clamp down on inflation, writes Christopher Parkes.

The year-on- year figure was 1.3 per cent hgher. 0 West German companies are Investing more slowly in east Germany than Initially planned, a survey by the ho economic research institute shows, Reuter adds from Munich. Ho said west Germany's manufacturing industry was inverting only DM9bn (SSbn) this year, down from the DMIObn initially forecast. Instead, it was raising its investment plans for 1992 by DMIlbn to DM16bn. The west German food industry was planning above-average investment in east Germany, Iso said. It was looking to total spend- ing of more than DM5bn by the end of 1992. Machinery, electronics and automotive companies planned DM2.5bn- DM4bn of investments. into trouble with plans to sell Narva, the Berlin-based elec- tric lamp maker, and con- flrmed the closure of the Robo- tron-S6mmerda office equipment company.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "IM R Carl Bildt, Swe- Sden's ntxt prime min- I ister and Moderate party leader, yesterday summed up the result of the general election on Sunday as a \"massive mandate for change and the Worst defeat for the left we have ever seen in this country since universal sus- fkage\". As he explained: \"The winds of political change blowing through Europe have finally hit Sweden\". The defeat of the country's Social Democrats is certainly historic; the party has gov. erned Sweden since September 1932 except for a brief period between 1976 and 1962. \"We Moderates were dissi- dents on the edge of the coun- try's Social Democratic consen- sus in the 1970s\", explains Mr Bildt, whose party was then a small element of the non-So- cialist bloc. This time it is different. Yes- terday, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrat prime minis- ter, offered his resignation and Mr Bildt was asked to form the next government. Over the past three years the Social Democrats have been forced to carry out market-ori- ented policies under pressure for more individual freedom and the internationalisation of the economy. \"We set the agenda for Swed- ish politics in the 1980s and we will do so for the new decade\", declared Mr Bildt. The reasons for the demise of the Social Democrats are complex. Mr Carlsson blames his government's 1990 1991 tax reforms, which eased the tax burden on above-average income earners but did little to reward its traditional support among manual workers. The deep recession also cost. the party votes as unemploy- ment has risen while inflation last year ate into living stan- dards. The Social Democrats prom- ised nothing new during the campaign and made a virtue out of their financial strin- gency, which was admirable but did little to attract lost vot- ers. Mr Carlsson also failed to trumpet his achievements in office, perhaps worrying that his market-oriented economic policies had upset the party Many voters were certainly bewildered by the Social Demo- crats' recent change of ideol- ogy. The party seemed to have abandoned the old faith and replaced it with economic lib- eral ideas which were never explained clearly to their sup- porters. SWEDISH POUTICAL UNb-UP Volte % Seats won Party 1991 1988 Change 1991 19 Social Democrats 37.6 43.2 -5.6 137 158 Left Party 4.5 5.9 -1.4 16 21 Moderates 21.9 18.3 +3.6 80 66 Liberals 9.2 12.2 -3.0 34 44 Centre 8.4 11.3 -2.9 31 42 Christian Democrats 7.0 2.9 +4.1 26 - New Democracy 6.7 - - 25 - Greens 3.4 5.5 -2.1 - 20 Turnnout 85.0 3.0 -1.0 The Greens leave Parliament for polling lte than the 4 pr cent threshold a, ceil Bildt cell) wlth:hlp~liberal ~o~nterpaFt Ben% We~terberg But there are also more fun- damental reasons for the defeat. Social Democracy lost heavily among many younger voters, to whom the party is synonymous with a benevolent but bureaucratic state hostile to individual freedom. Its ideological exhaustion combined with growing doubts about the administrative com- petence of the Carlsson govern- ment made it an uphill strug- gle for the party, though it recovered 10 perecentage points in the polls over the past six months. The Social Democrats were not the only losers in the elec- tion. Both the middle-of-the-road Liberal and Centre parties - the tradi- tional mainstays of the non-So- cialist-bloc - also suffered. For the Centre, only 20 years ago the largest of the non-So- cialist parties, it was the worst result they have suffered. Mr Olof Johansson, the party's leader, said the voters pun- ished them for co-operating with the last Social Democratic government. But the Centre is also suffer- ing from an identity crisis with its own supporters, who are unsure of what it stands for. Mr Johansson gave the impres- sion that his party was ready to serve in a non-Socialist coalition but only to uphold basically Social Democratic ideas. It seems now unlikely to join a Bildt-led government. The Liberals' performance was not as bad as their 1982 debacle. But they sus- fered because of their earlier readiness to join the Social Democrats in carrying through unpopular economic measures in the national inter- est. The arrival of the populist New Democracy party in par- liament is a sensational devel- opment. The party, led by a colourful duo - Count Ian Wachmeister and Mr Bert Karlsson, a funfair impressario - was formed about six months ago. Its message of free enter- prise, low taxes and cheaper alcohol expressed in an enter- taining style found a positive response among a minority of Swedes. The conservative Christian Democrats were also winners, entering parliament for the first time since their formation in 1964. Although the non-Socialist parties hold 196 seats in the 349-strong parliament they will not all work together because of New Democracy, which most of the others wish to shun. The outlook is therefore chaotic. Mr Bildt may find it possible to form only a one or two party non-Socialist govern- ment. But this could easily fall apart and precipitate a govern- ment crisis. For the moment it seems unlikely any of the small non- Socialist parties will co-operate with the still large Social Dem- ocrat minority. But such an option may eventually look attractive. Swedish politics have reached the end of the Social Democratic era. But what comes next is still unclear, although the country could move more into line with its neighbours Norway and Den- mark, who have wrestled with a fragmented political scene since the early 1970s when they first experienced the slow decay of Social Democracy but failed to replace it with a coherent non-Socialist alterna- tive.",

   "text_content" : "By Ging Hulchlno n In Munil THE Philippines Senate voted to evict the US military from the Philippines yesterday, the day a 25-year lease on Ameri- can bases in the country expired. The upper house rejected by 12 votes to 11 a treaty extend- ing the US lease of Subic naval base by 10 years and Clark Air Base for another 12 months. Approval of the treaty would have required a two-thirds majority, or 16 votes. Despite losing its legal man- date, Washington did not immediately announce a with- drawal, prefering to mark time as President Corazon Aquino manoeuvres to try to overturn the Senate vote via a referen- dum. \"We stand fully behind the president and her continuing effort to put in place the new treaty,\" said Mr Stanley Schra- ger, US embassy spokesman. \"In view of the referendum that Mrs Aquino has called for in December, plans to close Subic naval base and Clark Air Base are on hold.\" In Washington the US State Department said it was disap- pointed by the vote and added: \"We support President Aqui- no's efforts to find a way for the Philippine side to ratify the agreement. Obviously with the Philippine Senate's rejection of the agreement we will be looking more closely at the necessary preparations for withdrawal.\" Mrs Aquino vowed on Sun- day night to gather 3m voters' signatures, enough she says to sanction a nationwide referen- dum under an untested \"peo- ple's Initiative\" .\" Aquino. was also: \"'I. a unscheduled c place hs aron a.

Should the treaty pass the Senate, the people are spedcifically given a further say, but not if the upper house rejects such a pact. Politically she is stronger, to win votes among a people, outside the capital at least, which has a continuing affec- tion for the American GL If the treaty is not ratifed, Manila stands to lose tens of thousands of jobs, at least $2.2bn in payments for the bases, lucrative trade access arrangements and possibly a plan to restructure $5.3ba of foreign commercial debt. Those opposed to the treaty say the pact contravenes anti- nuclear and anti-war provi- sions in the constitution, is too long and pays too little. \"It's as though the Cold War was not yet over,\" Senator Jov- ito Salonga, the Senate presi- dent, said of the treaty he called \"one-sided and uncon- scionable,\" adding: \"September 16, 1991, may well be the day when we in this Senate found the soul, the true spirit, of the nation.\" A demonstrator burns an American flag outsiae te us embassy n MIanua yesteray",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Camegy in Jerusalem MR James Baker, US Secretary of State, last night pressed ahead with efforts to clinch Israeli and Palestinian agree- ment to attend a Middle East peace conference, despite a continuing dispute with Israel over US loan guarantees to fund resettlement of a wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants. After several hours of talks in Jerusalem between Mr Baker and three Palestinian leaders from the occupied terri- tories, it emerged that the two sides were drafting documents to outline understandings between them' on terms for the proposed conference. Earlier, Mr David Levy, Israeli foreign minister, said he expected similar written under- standings between Israel and the US to be drawn up today. He was speaking after more than three hours of talks in the afternoon involving Mr Yit- zhak Shamir, Israeli prime minister, Mr Moshe Arens, defence minister, and Mr Levy. No details were available about the respective under- standings, but Mr Baker's main task on his seventh trip to the Middle East since he began the effort to achieve Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, shortly after the Gulf war, was to bridge the remaining gap between Israel and the Arab side on who should represent the Palestinians. Israel wants a right of veto on the Palestinian delegation, insisting that no Arab from east Jerusalem or any member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation attend. Mr Baker's latest visit was clouded by Israeli anger over President George Bush's Insis tence that Israel's request for $10bn (Â£5.9bn) loan guarantees be shelved until after a peace conference. The issue remained unre- solved in the talks yesterday and was expected to be dis- cussed in meetings today. It appeared last night, though, that Mr Baker's main concern was to keep up the momentum for a conference, which Wash- ington wants to take place as early as next month.",

   "text_content" : "SHEIKBH Abbas Musawi, the leader of the pro-Iranian Hlzbollah movement, yesterday backtracked on a series of predictions that a western hostage was about to be freed in Beirut, saying that Israel's release of 51 Lebanese prison- ers and nine bodies last week was \"an incomplete step\" and that it was still up to Israel to make the next gesture, Lara Marlowe reports from Bei- rut. The setback appears to have been caused by one or a combination of sac- tors: Hisbollah's Insistence on freedom for Sheikh Abdul-Kariu Obeid, who was kidnapped by Israeli troops in July 1989; the multiplicity of parties involved, with one negotiator in Beirut saying he deals with at least 60 differ- ent interlocutors; a hitch over payment to the kidnappers by a party from a third country friendly to the US; and the kidnappers' desire to exclude the Lebanese government from involve- ment in hostage releases. All statements by pro-Iranian Shia leaders have emphasised the need to free Sheikh Obeld. In a press confer- ence at his south Beirut oice yester- day Sheikh Musawl twice alluded to payment, saying that \"every piece of nformation related to (Israelis missing in Lebanon) has a price\" and that some of those who had released westerners in the past \"got nothing In return\" but \"could release (others) for something.\" The kidnappers my also be attempt- ing to curtail Lebanese government involvement in the issue.

   "text_content" : "By Christopher BobinskI in Warsaw POLAND'S budgrt spending cuts for this year yesterday stood a better chance of winning a speedy passage through parliament after the govern- ment failed by 19 votes to win a two- thirds majority for special powers to bypass the legislature on the issue. The government had argued that it needed such wide-ranging powers while the new parliament got into its stride and a new government was formed after the general elections on October 27. However, after the vote on Saturday, parliamentary deputies of every politi- cal hue and persuasion rushed to declare willingness to approve the bud- get and speedy changes in pension laws the government wants. None want to be accused during the elections of acting irresponsibly. Changes in banking laws tightening the central bank's supervisory powers will also be passed soon.

   "article_dc_title" : "Democrat Victory Ruffles Hong Kong Feathers",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "4lctiton nA Hong Kong, but power remains far from their - . Neverthelss, the Demo. crat' weeping victory has left theim with everything to play far asthe handoverto China in 197 comes ever closer. The Democrats and their allies won 16 of he 18 directly elected seats. But another 21, largely representing pro-busi- ness and pro-China positions outside Mr Lee's liberal group- ing, were indirectly elected by professional and trade groups, while the governor will appoint a further 17 councillors and four officials in the next two weeks. These appointments will decide the balance of power in the 60-seat Legislative Council. Mr Lee said the government should appoint liberal-minded people to the council in propor- tion to the liberal camp's suc- cess in the direct polls. This would effectively turn the Democrats into the ruling party. He warned that if the gov- ernment uses its appointees to counter the Democrats, this will only further undermine its credibility. And if liberal appointments are not made, he said he may take the matter to UK premier Mr John Major. \"We have now got the man- date of the people. We have been elected by the Hong Kong people on our platforms and we have now got to implement them,\" Mr Lee said. The government is likely to view this demand as undermin- ing its authority. In the past the council has been some- thing of a rubber stamp because it was filled with gov- ernment appointees. As well as passing legislation, it has the power to approve or block gov- ement - Observers belive the gov- erment w isk lown the Democrats wide enough power base to have an effective veto over spending, and winl therefore try to coPIproise, perhaps by apponting acoue of tokenib Ito the WcoVuni. The government aluO ses prepared, if necessary, to stand up to the Democrats. * As the size of the Democrats' Angus Foster assesses the implications of the landslide election win by anti-Beijing liberals victory sank in yesterday, there were signs the party is to become more aggressive. Before the elections, Mr Lee wanted representatives from successful parties to be offered seats on the Executive Council (Exco), the government's high- est policy making body. Now, Mr Lee talks of being given a majority of the 10 seats on Exco, which would be unthink- able for the government. The government says it will consider appointing directly elected politicians to Exco as long as they adhere to rules about collective responsibility and confidentiality, as in Britain. The Democrats argue it is impossible for them, as elected representatives of Hong Kong, to follow the government line if they think it is against the interests of Hong Kong. For example, the Democrats want to lower the voting age to 18. If Exco voted against this, Demo- crat members would have to defend the decision in public. But the thorniest problems involve. Hong Kona's relations with China and demands for more democracy. One of the Democrats' campaign pledges was to push for half the coun. dil to be directly elected in the next elections in 19965, instead ofone-third as agreed between Britain and China. The Demo- crats ao called for the Basic Law, Hiag Kong's mini-consti- tution awr 197, to be made more de~eerrfltIc The Brtsh and Hong Kong governments are working towards a smooth transition in 1997 and do not want to anger Beijing by pushing for more All three governments, as well as business leaders in Hong Kong, are likely to try to undermine the Democrats' calls by pointing to the direct elections' lower than expected voter turnouit of 40 per cent as suggesting Hong Kong is unsure about faster political reform, a suggestion strongly denied by Mr Lee, The Democrats' four most popular candidates, including Mr Lee, are closely linked to the Hong Kong Alliance. This is a group of activists who attacked China for the 1989 Tianamen Square killing and helped dissidents escape. The Alliance is detested by Beijing which branded its members subversive. But the strength of public support for the four is now likely to make the Democrats more outspoken in their criti- cism of China. \"Until Sunday, no one could claim to represent the interests of the Hong Kong people. Now, we represent them and it is only right that Britain and China should listen to the views of the people of Hong Kong and their elected repre- sentatives.\" Mr Lee said.",

   "text_content" : "By Stephanie Gray MS Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, yes- terday defended her govern- ment's tough monetarist poli- cies which have seen the dismantling of the welfare state and a slide in popularity. Speaking after an address to the UK Institute of Directors in London, Ms Richardson expressed confidence that her National party government's radical economic reforms would see a political \"pay-of\" by the time it faces re-leltion in 1993. Three-year electoral terms have often undone poli- cies pursued by both main New Zealand parties. \"We have in the past 10 months put into place the fun- damental economic reforms. We have two years and two months to get the politics right,\" she said. Opinion polls show govern- ment support has fallen to 20 per cent from 49 per cent when it was swept to power last October. However, yesterday Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, announced what was being seen as his finance minister's first significant defeat when he pledged to take a \"moderate, commonsense approach\" to cutting tariffs. He said general tariffs would be reduced by a third between 1993 and 1996. There would be a further orderly reduction after 1996 at a rate which would be decided in 1994. 'Analysts have portrayed the' debate over the speed of tariff cuts as a key one between Ms Richardson and her opponents within the government who want to take a less stringent tone. Earlier this month, Ms Richardson described those who wanted slower tariff reform as \"industrial doom- makers\". New Zealand tariffs range from about 16 per cent to 29 per cent on products where there are local manufactur- ers.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Treasury Pledge to Fight Restrictive Banking Reform",
   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE US Treasury would rather abandon its efforts to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which has separated commercial and investment banking in the US since 1933, than accept the restrictive changes put forward by a congressional committee. \"We would rather have no Glass-Steagall repeal than bad Glass-Steagall repeal,\" Mr Rob- ert Glauber, Treasury under- secretary for finance, said yes- terday. The House energy and com- merce committee last week put forward a draft banking reform bill which would have repealed the Act, but would have put in its place a set of firewalls between banking and securi- ties activities even fiercer than the current curbs. The draft bill would com- pletely bar commercial compa- nies from owning banks, and would stop banks from offering a full range of financial ser- vices, including securities underwriting and insurance. The Treasury argues that the restrictions would under- mine its efforts to reform bank- nin legislation in a way that Smake US banks more corn- petitive. It has urged that commercial companies, which can already own thrift institutions and \"non-banks\" that provided vir- tually all the services of a bank, should also be allowed to buy full banks. \"A keystone of our approach is to try to get private capital into the banking industry. Our question is - why not let an IBM buy a bank if it wants to, so long as it can be done safely,\" Mr Glauber said. \"At a minimum, we think taxpayers should get a break by allowing commercial firms to buy into a failing bank,\" he urged, noting that several of the 33 thrift institutions owned by commercial firms would have had to be bailed out by the federal government, but for cash injections from their par- ent companies. The Treasury complains that the energy and commerce com- mittee draft would bring about \"ant-competitive rollbacks\" of the existing law. It would prohibit, for exam. ple, banks from lending to a client and underwriting its securities at the same time nor would a bank's trust and discretionary 'accounts be allowed to invest in secuirities it had underwritten, these being tougher restrictions than those now applied to stockbro- kers which own \"non-bank\" subsidiaries. Mr Glauber said the Trea- sury would seek to modify these restrictions in the com- mittee stage. It unsuccessful, it would work then to obtain changes in debate on the floor of the House and, in a last resort, would try to have the whole segment of the bill deal- ing with these areas deleted. Some banking industry groups complain, however, that the White House and Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secre- tary, have failed in recent months to put enough of their weight behind a comprehen- sive banking reform.",

He also chided himself for not having been sceptical toward the late William Casey, then his boss at the CIA, over the affair. Doubts about the nominee's role in Iran-contra - with charges that he slanted raw intelligence on the Soviet Union to fit Reagan adminis- tration policy - appear the main obstacles to nomination. Mr Gates sought yesterday to deal with explosive issues which have made the commit- tee delay his nomination for more than four months. He categorically denied that he was involved in a covert operation to funnel arms to Iraq during the 1980s via South Africa and Chile, and that he was given more than flimsy warnings about Iran-contra (illegal diversion of funds from arms sales to Iran to the Nic- araguan rebels). Mr Gates's prospects were given an indirect fillip yester- day when a federal judge in Washington dismissed the case against Mr Oliver North, the Marine lieutenant-colonel at the centre of Iran-contra. A key witness - Mr Robert McFar- lane, former national security adviser to President Reagan - has admitted that his testi- mony at an earlier trial of Mr North was tainted by the for- mer marine's statements to Congress in 1987. The Senate committee opened the Gates hearings with members criticising the CIA for faulty intelligence work on the Soviet Union and Iraq in the 1980s, particularly exaggeration of the Soviet threat and the underestimation of economic weakness. In 1987, Mr Gates, 47, was forced to withdraw his nomina- tion to succeed Mr Casey as CIA head, senators having expressed concern about his account of what he knew about Iran-contra. Replying to questions yester- day, Mr Gates cast himself as the high-level analyst by- passed by Casey. Asked to explain discrepancies in official accounts, he portrayed Iran- contra as a rogue operation known only to a handful of people. On arms sales to Iraq, Mr Gates said that he had never encouraged such shipments - as alleged to the committee by Mr Ari Ben-Menashe, an Israeli former military intelligence official - or that the two had met in Chile or the US. Mr Gates also said he had never visited the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, factory of Inter- national Signal and Control, the defence company bought by Ferranti of the UK, which shipped ballistic missile tech- nology to South Africa, some of which went to Iraq.",

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington THE Bush administration has begun considering a request by American machine-tool makers for continuation of controls on imports from Japan and Taiwan on grounds of national security. The US industry will have had five years of \"temporary\" protection by the end of 1991 under \"Voluntary Restraint Agreements\" (VRAs) reached with Japan and Taiwan. The industry is still contending that it needs limits on imports and that its protection is vital to the US national security. The Association for Manu- facturing Technology (NMTBA) has taken its case to both Capitol Hill and the Bush administration. About 100 congressmen - including 14 members of the key ways and means committee - and more than 20 senators have responded by urging President Bush to extend the VRAs for three to five years. The lobbying effort can be seen as a test case of the administration's view on the need to protect companies which once could claim their survival was vital to US defence. In the past decade few indus- tries have won that argument, and that was before the end of the Cold War. In Congress, however, sentiment has been building for the need to broaden the definition of \"national security\" to \"national economic security\". This would lay the foundation for protection of industries deemed vital to American man- ufacturing capacity. The Bush administration has rejected this view; but next year is a presidential election, and industry groups could find they have increased clout. The machine-tool industry has been having a slow year, but much of that could be attri- buted to the recession. Orders for the first seven months were $1.4bn (Â£820m), down 18 per cent from last year. However, they rose 88 per cent in July, giving some indi- cation of a pick-up in the econ- omy. Imports have climbed 7 per cent this year, after falling slightly to $2Jbn for 1990. The current VRAs limit the Japanese and Taiwanese shares of the US market in machinng centres, lathes, mil- ing machines and punching and shearing machines. Thse products represent more than 40 per cent of the US market The controls have allowed US producers to recapture some of the market.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney A privately-owned Australian company yesterday said it planned to ship up to 10min ;heep a year to Vladivostok in scountertrade deal negotiated with a state-owned Russian trading group. Mr James Ferguson, co- )wner of Perth-based Farmex, iaid the sheep would be shipped on board converted Russian whalers fitted with laughtering and freezing facil- ities. The company plans to buy surplus sheep from wool- growers hit by a slump in world prices. The sheep would be slaughtered in international waters, avoiding the high costs of Australian slaughterhouses. Mr Ferguson said Dalso, a company owned by the govern- ment of the Russian Republic, had agreed to provide up to 10 ships, some of which would be acquired from associated com- panies. Farmex would be paid in Soviet roubles, which would be used to buy oil and petroleum products, fish, timber and other products for export to Europe, he said. The Russian products would be marketed by Toncity Man- agement, a Swiss company jointly owned by Farmex, Dalso and Toncity, a Swiss manufacturing group. Mr Ferguson said the sheep acquired by Farmex would be ageing animals between five and six-years-old which would otherwise be shot and buried under the government's flock reduction scheme. The sheep are worth less than A$1 (40p) to farmers because the cost of transport- ing and slaughtering them in Australia exceeds the value of the processed meat. \"The rural sector will gain around A$100m a year from this for sheep which would otherwise have no value. But that is not the end of the story because the Russians want all sorts of food, and we are also talking to producers of chick- ens and potatoes,\" Mr Ferg- uson said. Farmex hopes to have three ships operating between Australia and Russia's Pacific coast next year, build- ing up to 10 ships carrying 10m sheep a year. However, the deal faces strong opposition from trade union and animal rights groups.",

Iitem' agenda Itat includes so miany hardy peren- nials that the worl political Gupheavlis of the past -year might never have hppened the selection of the nert chif is a paramount issue. The UN is enjoyngunprece- dented international atproval, after its recent political suc- cesses and crucial role in the Gulf crisis, so the post Is more attractive than ever for a host of diplomatic over-achievers. The salary of $190,000 may be moderate but the perks include status equivalent to' that of a head of government, as well as a large staff of aides and retainers, and a handsome riverside home in Manhattan, by New York's East river. At least a score of declared or potential candidates believe they have the stuff to handle what the late Dag Hammar- skj6ld, the second sec- retary-general, once called the most impossible job on earth. Half-a-dozen are from Africa, which has never filled the post and where there is belief that its time has come. The most conspicuous Afri- can candidate is Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, Egyptian dep- uty prime minister for foreign affairs. A Paris-educated Coptic Christian who accompanied the late President Sadat on his historic mission to Jerusalem and at Camp David, his French connection has drawn France's favour. But his age, 68, may count against him for such a strenuous job. France - with the US, Britain, the Soviet Union and China - has veto power in the choice of the secretary-general, with a chance or a not seat on the East river: (from ien) yuennammar, Ogata, Prince Isaaru , Aras who must be endorsed by the Security Council and appointed by the General Assembly. The Big Five's foreign minis- ters will meet in New York soon. France, current president of the council, wants a quick decision, if possible before the end of October. The Peruvian incumbent, reappointed in 1985, insists that he wants no new mandate. Still some delegates believe he might accept another year or two, enabling bin to deal with such unfinished UN business as the Gulf war aftermath. That would be a big disap- pointment for Prince Sadrud- din Aga Khan, his special rep- resentative for the Gulf, who is eager to step into his boss's shoes, having run and lost before. Early this year, Prince Sadruddin, who has Iranian citizenship and is the French- born son of the Aga Khan III, was a favourite to succeed, but his lustre seems to have dimmed. US officials still regard him, however, as in a reasonably strong position, if only because he might be the second choice of many. For the first time, a captain of industry is in an unofficial list of possible contenders - Mr Pehr Gustaf Gyllen- hammar, the head of Volvo. Neither he nor Mr Hans Janitschek of Austria, a former secretary-general of Socialist International now serving as a UN consultant, and the only candidate to have offered him- self by formal letter to the Council president, is given much chance. Those who have let it be known publicly, or in private to governments, that they are ready and willing to serve include Mr All Alatas, Indone- sian foreign minister. believed at one time to have a good chance, but his prospects too seem to have faded. So have those of most of the African contenders. The Organisation of African Unity's failure to endorse one candi- date, but rather to settle for a field of six, has not helped its claim to the succession. General Olusegun Obasanjo, former military president of Nigeria who now runs a chicken farm, Mr Bernard Chidzero, Zimbabwe finance minister, Mr Kenneth Dadzie of Ghana, secretary-general of a UN agency, and Mr James Jonah of Sierra Leone, another senior UN official, are canvass- ing hard. A new entry at the weekend was Mr Michel Doo Kingue of Cameroon, executive director of Unitar, the UN Institute for Training and Research. Mr Martti Ahtisaari of Fin- land, who ran the UN opera- tion that brought indepen- dence to Namibia and now is back in his country's foreign ministry, Mr Jan Eliasson, Sweden's UN ambassador, and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, are among possible choices from the Nordic countries. Rounding out a current list of possible candidates, to which other names may be added, are Mr Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace prize-winner and former president of Costa Rica, Mrs Sadako Ogata of Japan, UN High Commissioner for Refugees whose handling of a difficult job is much admired, Mr T TB Koh, a former ambas- sador of Singapore to the UN and the US who now heads a committee preparing for the UN global conference on the environment next year, Mr Maurice Strong, millionaire Canadian secretary-general of that conference, and Mr Olara Otunnu, a Ugandan former ambassador and now president of the New York-based Interna- tional Peace Academy. Before any resolution to the succession, the General Assem- bly must choose today among three candidates for the office of president for the new ses- sion, this being the first time for several years the job has been contested. Candidates for this are Sir Michael Somari, foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Samir Shihabi, Saudi Arabia's chief UN dele- gate, and Mr Abdalla al-Ashtal, Yemen's chief delegate.",

Sir William Ryrie, the bank's executive vice-president, yesterday said he expects lender governments to approve the IFC's next capital increase within six to nine months. The increase will raise IFC invest- ment from $1.5bn a year to about $4bn a year, and increase project finance from $10.5bn to about $30bn a year. He said he expects privatising activity to rise, with the bank assist in about 100 such projects over the next five years in eastern Europe, where it has been active already, and elsewhere. Last year, the JFC approved 43 projects for capital sector development worth $200m. He expects the number of such projects to rise to 300 over the next five years, costing about $1.4bn. The IFC will maintain its emphasis on mobilising other resources for investment, along with IFC funds. The target ratio is one IFC dollar to six raised from private sources.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington GERMANY'S Chancellor Helmut Kohl attempted to inject urgency into the Gatt trade liberalisation negotia- tions in talks with President George Bush in Washington yesterday. Among EC countries, Ger- many, along with France, has been the most opposed to cuts in farm subsidies at the level demanded by the US. But Mr Kohl said both the EC, the US and the other partners had to be ready to move on textiles, services and agricultural trade. \"We have to do everything to prevent a split arising between the US and Europe, and we cannot accept in the long run that the developing nations should drift farther and farther behind us. It is absurd not to allow these mainly agricultural countries to sell on our mar- kets,\" Mr Kohl said. \"All of us have to under- stand that if Gatt fails, we all fall,\" he said. He said failure to reach a Gatt deal would be disastrous for Germany, which exports 35 per cent of output. Leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised nations agreed in London in July that the Gatt talks must succeed at all costs. Mr John Major, UK premier, promised to call a spe- cial summit if it looked as though the talks would fail. EC fam policy, Page 20",

   "text_content" : "By Alar Pile, Sciali Affairs Correspondent RI IMPROVEMENTS in prison life allied to tiUgter security were announced by Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, yester- day in the most widespread penal reform programme of recent times. , The government has accepted most of the recom- mendations of Lord Justice Woolfs inquiry into last year's spate of serious prison distur- bances, including the riot at Strangeways, in Manchester, the worst in a British jail. Some of the government's proposals to make prison life more humane and constructive will take years to implement. Ministers are soft-pedaling on one of the Woolf report's main recommendations to tackle overcrowding - that prisons should not exceed certified accommodation levels without parliament being informed. The government aims to re- examine this idea in the mid- 1990s, by which time it hopes the prison population and prison placed will be in bal- ance. Overcrowding is a lead- ing cause of tension in inner- city prisons. Prison reform organisations welcomed the thrust of the plans, set out in a white paper, but regretted the absence of stronger commitments on implementation and resources. Ms Vivien Stern, director of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders .(Nacro), said the white paper was \"strong on promises of reform but weak on timetabled commitments to implement most of the prom- ised changes\". The Apex Trust, the ex-offender employment organisation, complained of Treasury restraint in providing finance to support the white paper's proposals.

Some of the points Mr Kin- nock made to a quiet audience - no heckling here - could have come straight from the letter the Engineering Employ- ers' West Midlands Associa- tion wrote to the chancellor just before the last Budget: reintroduction of capital allowances to speed invest- ment, for example. But after- wards there were those who shook their heads, saying: \"I doubt if he can deliver.\" The impression Mr Kinnock sought to convey was of a future prime minister, friend- lier to business than the pres- ent and immediate past incum- bents, who only wanted what businessmen want themselves. His delivery was measured, his response to questions con- ciliatory. \"He came across well,\" acknowledged one lis- tener before adding the caveat, \"same old platitudes, it seemed to me.\" Mr Kinnock, it is true, pro- vided a re-run of announced Labour economic policy, but within that framework he ruled out, with great empha- sis, devaluation to increase competitiveness. He came through as a devo- tee of European monetary union. \"The interest-rate cost and the potential instability of large international capital flows makes progress towards monetary union attractive,\" he said. In all of this he probably had his audience with him. But the West Midlands execu- tives, downcast by recession, were worried about costs and tax, about what they perceive as Labour's preoccupation with regulation. The Labour proposal for a minimum wage rate of Â£3.40 an hour would lead to less employment, he was told. \"How can this be of any use to make business flourish?\" he was asked. People do not mind Increases in taxation if the money is spent wisely, Mr Kin- nock was reminded, but would Labour spend a higher tax take that way? Mr innock would not have himself cast in the role of spendthrift. \"If the floating voter thinks we have spend- spend-pend polieks, then the loating voter has not been lis- tening,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "RISIS? What crisis? The studied calm emanating from Labour's Wal- worth Road headquarters yes- terday belied any suggestion that the party either is, or should be, in a tailspin over the Tories' weekend return to an opinion poll lead. Ambushed by reporters in Birmingham, Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, eschewed jus- tifiable irritation and dis- missed yet more dispiriting questioning of his leadership with a jocular guffaw. Immodestly listing his achievements, he added: \"I have been and am a very good captain of the team, and you don't drop winning captains.\" This time at least, the \"offi- cial\" mood appears to reflect more or less faithfully a broad swathe of opinion throughout the parliamentary Labour party. Outsiders daring to suggest that improving economic indi- cators and two polls showing a Conservative lead of four or five points might just be a cause for concern were brushed aside as fainthearts or naive. As the shadow cabinet meets today, Labour's message will be repeated like a mantra: the Tory revival is a short-term phenomenon. The release from Beirut of the British hostage, Mr John MacCarthy, the failed Soviet coup, Kennebunkport and Beijing were happy chances for Mr Major, bol- stered by his good luck in being this year's chairman of the Group of Seven industrial powers. But, like warm summers, all these good things will come to an end, Labour's cheerful mer- chants of gloom insist. When the voters return from holiday to their mortgages, tatty public services, mounting unemploy- ment and a refocusing of Brit- ish politics on the domestic agenda, the opposition Ivo Dawnay on the party's strategy now it has fallen back in opinion polls will regain its natural lead. \"The fact that the Tories are dithering about a November election shows that they doubt whether they can win it,\" one MP pointed out. \"That has got to suggest that we are right not to be too worried.\" Yet, when all that is said, the more thoughtful Labour analysts concede that this is no time for complacency and there is evidence that there has been some complacency about. The much-discussed concept of the permanent election cam- paign throughout the holiday months failed to materialise. The absence abroad of Mr Kin- nock during the Soviet crisis was understandable, but unfor- tunate. And, earlier this month, when the Tories had gone on the offensive on Labour's defence policies, there was, some claim, a sense of drift. Questions are likely to be raised in the shadow cabinet about whether an adequate media rota of available \"heavy- weights\" had been drawn up. Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, is also expected to suffer a mild rap across the knuckles if only pour encourager les autres. Like it or not, Labour's image as a Rolls-Royce of polit- ical public relations built up under the regime of Mr Peter Madelson, and still current up to the spring of this year - seems to have suffered a series of knocks just as the Tories have changed up a couple of gears. For the shadow cabinet, however, the main business of the meeting will be to concen- trate on the annual conference at the end of the month and, the weeks that follow it. Aware that the Tories will be truppet- ing an economic recovery, Labour aims to subvert voter optimism. In a speech in Newcastle upon Tyne yesterday, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, enthusiastically set about the task by defining the end to the recession as the moment that unemployment begins to fall and growth returns to an annual rate of 2.5 per cent - criteria safely far from the reach of this parliament. Whereas the Tories will merely create a consumer-led upturn, yet again sowing the seeds for a new boom-and-bust cycle, Labour's more upbeat' conference prescription will promise a Kinnock government actively engaged in building the conditions for an investment-led turnabout. \"The message we have got to get over is that Britain needs to do better than recover,\" one: backroom strategist insisted. \"We must remind voters that thanks to this government, and with 1992 coming, we have got to catch up with our European partners from a considetably lower base performance.\"?., Under pressure from -.the shadow spending ministers, the conference will also tackle the charge of fighting a nega- tive campaign by underl\"iftgj positive programmes - on, Labour's traditional 'winning\" sectors of health aid educa-, tion. w - When the House of Com- mons returns, banana skins both ancient - such as the poll tax - and modem - such as the BCCI collapse ,A will surely come to the aid of the people's party.

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith BRITISH ministers are reshuffled more often than most of their continental coun- terparts, making many of them \"toddlers rather than veter- ans\" in their departmental responsibilities, according to a report published today. Professor Richard Rose, of the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde, says that while ministers make effective politi- cal ambassadors for their departments, their short terms in office encourage them to concentrate on topics that offer short-term popularity and hamper their ability to direct government. The study says that the aver- age cabinet minister holds a departmental post for just under 2% years, but that turn- over varies greatly between ministries. While the average trade and industry secretary lasts just 16 months, the average for the lord chancellor is over 4% years. The dearth of candi- dates for the posts of Welsh and Scottish secretary contrib- ute to Tories in those posts also having long tours of duty. A reshuffle has become an almost inevitable part of the political year, although Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, broke with recent tradition in 1988 when she moved it to July from Sep- tember to end Uncertainty about her intentions. Professor Rose's paper, pub- lished by the Institute of Eco- nomic Affairs, a rightwing think tank, accepts that the political advantages to a prime minister of frequent reshuffles mean that they are unlikely to be abandoned. It also notes that, although ministers can end up in depart- ments where they are effec- tively amateurs, the tactic of bringing in outsiders with expertise, such as business- men, usually fails because the businessmen in turn are ama- teurs at being political ambas- sadors. Professor Rose urges the cre- ation of policy directorates within departments to bring together the skills of politi- cians, civil servants and out- side experts. Such a directorate, which he suggests could be tried first at the Treasury and the Foreign Office, would be responsible to the secretary of state, but would have operational charge of the department iather than being an extended ministerial private office.

   "text_content" : "eu Polar Mavh Economics Staff THE 15-month decline in manufacturing production appears to have halted, the central Statistical Office said yesterday, after publishing fig- ures showing a small rise in output in July. The CSO said it was too early to talk of a resumption of growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about a quarter of total UK output, but its assessment will encourage hopes of a general lift in the economy later this year. According to the CSO, sac- tory output volumes increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in July compared with June, thanks mainly to a good performance by the chemical and car sectors, especially in exports. The CSO said the month-on-month rise was \"healthy, but narrowly based\". In the three months to July, compared with the previous quarter, manufacturing output rose by 0.5 per cent, the first quarter-on-quarter increase since July last year. The Confederation of British Industry said there were some \"encouraging signs\" about prospects for manufacturing, although it expected further Manufacturing output Rolling % change (3 months on 3 months) 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 slight falls in output later this year before a modest recovery began. According to the CSO, sac- tory output has been on a downward trend since it hit an all-time peak in April last year. Assuming it has now hit bot- tom, production has declined by 6 per cent from this point. It stands roughly 25 per cent higher at constant prices com- pared with the end of the 1979-80 recession. Because of a fall of 2 per cent in the output of the energy and water industries in July, out! put in this month of all pouc- tion sectors - energy, ater and manufacturing - was.t tie changed compared with June. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, production indusestr showed a rise in output in July of 0.5 per cent. Energy output in recent months has been highly erratic because oil and gas production in the North Sea has been dis- rupted by a big programme of maintenance work, now virtu. ally ended. Also, the bad weather in June stimulated demand for energy, giving production a temporary boost. In individual sectors of man- ufacturing, car production was 4 per cent up in the three months to July, compared with the February-April period. On a similar quarter-on-quarter basis, the chemicals and met- als industries increased pro- duction by 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. Engineering and related industries, as well as textiles and clothing, each recorded a fall of 1 per cent, while food, drink and tobacco saw little change.",

   "text_content" : "By James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent THE SCOTTISH engineering industry believes that the recession has bottomed out and a slow recovery is under way. A survey by Scottish Engineering, an employers' organisation, found that a only small minority of companies were now pessimistic about their prospects. The quarterly survey showed that 26 per cent of companies were optimistic, while 22 per cent were pessimistic. A total of 29 per cent of com- panies had improved their order books in the past three months, while 30 per cent had unchanged order books and 41 per cent said their order books had declined. The survey was the first of its kind by Scottish Engineer- ing, which represents about 300 companies in all sectors of engineering, from electron- ics to foundries, but excluding the offshore oil industry. These companies have between them about 50,000 employees who comprise about half the Scottish engineering workforce. The response rate to the survey was 55 per cent. The survey showed that 83 per cent of companies respond- ing had increased their spend- ing on training. But only 11 per cent had increased their capi- tal spending and 30 per cent had cut it. Scottish Engineering said that foundries, which are at the beginning of the manufac- turing process, were perform- ing better than three months earlier, while electronics was performing poorly.",

In accordance wvith the provisions of the First Supplemental Trust Deed dated 2 July 1987 constituting the Bonds that offer is extended to each of the holders of the Bonds (the \"Bondholders\") on the basis of one new share for every five ordinary shares which would have been allotted to him had he converted his Bond(s) immediately prior to the offer being made to the Company's ordinary shareholders. The current conversion rate is 266.75 ordinary shares per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Bonds. The rights issue is renounceable in relation to ordinary shareholders, Employee Plan shareholders and Executive Plan shareholders and non-renounceable in relation to Bondholders. Fractional entitlements will be rounded up to the next whole share. The purpose of the rights issue is to maintain the Company's gearing and restore cash reserves following the successful acquisition of Petersville Sleigh Limited. The total net proceeds from the issue, estimated to be approximately A$672.5 million, will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital. Initially, all or a portion of such proceeds may be invested in interest bearing deposits or securities or used to reduce debt. In respect of the year ended 30 June 1991, the Company will pay a total dividend of 21 cents per share fully franked. New shares issued pursuant to the rights issue will not participate in this dividend of 21 cents per share, but will rank for all subsequent ordinary dividends. In all other respects the new shares will rank pari passu with existing ordinary shares. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Company expects at least to maintain the same rate of dividend per share in respect of the year ending 30 June 1992 on the increased capital resulting from the rights issue. Since the introduction of the dividend imputation system in July 1987, the Company has paid fully franked dividends. Over the past four years, however, the proportion of the Company's profit contribution by overseas operations has increased. Taxes paid overseas on these profits do not give rise to franking credits. The Company's dividend payout ratio has also increased over this period, especially in the financial year just completed. These factors make it likely that in the foreseeable future the Company will be paying dividends which are less than fully franked. As a consequence of the slow economic recovery expected in Australia, the expansion of capital pursuant to the rights issue, and the minimal franking capacity likely to be contributed by Petersville Sleigh Limited due to the recovery of prior year tax losses, the Company's franking capacity generated in the current financial year is expected to be abnormally low. At this stage it is anticipated, subject to unforeseen circumstances, that the dividends to be paid in respect of the year ending 30 June 1992, will be franked in the order of 55 per cent. Based on the current tax laws and the existing mix of the Company's operations between Australia and overseas and barring unforeseen developments, the Company's franking capacity is expected to improve progressively thereafter. In order to maximise the extent to which dividends can be franked, the 1991-92 interim dividend, which normally would have been paid in May 1992, will be deferred until July 1992. This new timing of the interim dividend, which is expected to be maintained in future, will bring the payment of dividends in respect of each financial year into the same time period as the Group's Australian tax payments, which are the principal source of franking credits. Potter Warburg Capital Markets Limite and E.L. & C. Bailleu Limited are underwriters to the issue for a joint fee of 1.1 per cent. of the amount underwritten and a management fee of 0.1 per cent. of the amount underwritten.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Baxter GEC Alsthom, the Franco- British power engineering group, is to cut 220 jobs in its electro-mechanical division at Trafford Park, Manchester. The company, jointly owned by GEC of the UK and Alcatel Alsthom of France, blamed the cuts on falling orders for spares and servicing. It warned in a letter to employees that there might be more cuts if demand did not improve. GEC Alsthom employs more than 2,500 people at Trafford Park, and 850 of them are in the electro-mechanical divi- sion. In April the company announced a cut of 28 Jobs at its heat-exchanger group in Manchester. That was part of a much larger package of 900 job cuts which included the planned closure of GEC Als- thom's factory in Lame, North- ern Ireland. The job cuts come less than a week after GEC Alsthom announced it had won a Â£450m contract from National Power to build a 1,360MW combined- cycle power station at Didcot, Oxfordshire.

   "text_content" : "By Michael Smith, Labour Correspondent WHITE-COLLAR workers at British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) are being urged by union lead- ers to join their manual worker colleagues in staging industrial action over a 7 per cent pay offer. The Institution of Profess- ionals, Managers and Special- ists (IPMS) and other white- collar unions are recommend- ing their members to vote for action to complement an over- time ban by blue-collar work- ers which would start with a one-day strike. Union leaders believe the action is having a significant effect on output, although BNFL is not saying how much. All plants are still in operation, it says. Disputes over pay have been rare since the recession began, especially when employers offer more than the rate of inflation as BNFL has done. Mr Dai Hudd, IPMS national officer, said the company could afford to improve the offer both to industrial and non- industrial workers. Last year saw an increase in productivity of at least 20 per ceit, he said. Voting in the IPMS ballot will start today and last until October 4. * Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has rejected union demands for a 6.5 per cent pay offer to more than 50,000 tax staff to be increased, according to the Inland Revenue Staff Federation. Union leaders met the chan- cellor, together with Treasury and Inland Revenue officials, late last week to argue for changes also to be made to the way performance *pay is awarded. Union leaders are to decide today on the next move. The chancellor said he would consider arbitration, according to Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF gen- eral secretary.",

   "text_content" : "By Higio Dixon OFTEL, the regulatory body for the telecommunications industry, should investigate whether BT ought to be broken up to aid competition, the com- pany's main rival, Mercury Communications, said yester- day. Mr Peter van Cuylenburg, Mercury's chief executive, said the question of breaking BT into one long-distance and sev- eral local telephone companies - along the lines of the break-up of American Tele- phone and Telegraph in the 1980s - should be put on the agenda. Speaking after a tele- communications conference organised by the Economist magazine, he said that the mat- ter should be examined next year when Oftel is due to look at BT's pricing structure. Mr van Cuylenburg argued that a break-up would be good for customers because competi- tion would develop more quickly. He said that so long as BT's local and long-distance operations were integrated, it would be difficult for rivals to compete on an equal basis. In recent months, the idea of breaking up BT has been revived. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Demo- crats, has been advocating such a move, while Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director gen- eral, has raised the possibility NYNEX, the US telephone company, has consoldated its interest In the UK cable television market by buying out Britannia Cablesystem's interest in franchises cover- ing the Solent area, north and north-east Surrey, Dar- lington, Teesside and the Wirral, involving around 750,000 homes, Raymond Snoddy writes. Last year Nynex, one of the regional companies spun off from the Bell Telephone Compmy, bought a 49 per owned by Britannia Cable- systems. According to the the Inde- pendent Television Commis- sion, multi-channel cable networks are capable of serv- ing 1m homes. Earlier this year 191,610 homes were subscribing to those systems - an increase of 79 per cent over the past year. of a less radical approach involving splitting the com- pany into separate subsid- iaries. Mr van Cuylenburg said a break-up could take place after the government completes its sale of a second tranche of shares in the company in November. He claimed it would be good for shareholder value.",

It is intended that the stainless steel interests so acquired will form the basis for the development of the Columbus project which aims to establish a cost competitive, state of the art stainless steel facility. A detailed reassessment of the project is underway to optimise the synergies and economies that will be brought about by this acquisition. The capital cost of the Columbus project is expected to be somewhat lower than previously contemplated, while further benefits will flow from MS&A's expertise in the production and marketing of stainless steel; 4.2 the ferro-alloy operations of MS&A and the chromite interests will be acquired by Samancor for approximately R575 million (five hundred and seventy five minion rand).

The steel shutters on the windows keep out both thieves and nat- ural light. But Mr. Azam is staying put. \"What choice have we got?\" he says. \"You can't sell the shop - you can't give it away.\" A customer concurs: \"It was a really good business, a going concern, and now it's not worth the price of a packet of tabs [cigarettes].\" Mr Azam has run his shop in Scotswood for 10 years, living upstairs with his family.

Mr Azam Shutter. dpwu Mloh~a,~lmd Az~mu'u shqpi sits between a burnt~it once had a shop in a better area than Scotswood, but had to trade down after his brother, for whom he had stood as guar- antor, ran into business diffi- culties. For 25 years Mr Azam, a father of six, has worked seven days a week - his shop, run with his wife's help, opens even on Christmas Day. Aged 42, he could pass for 60. Until last week, turnover was Â£3,500 a week. But the pet- rol bombing of the Post OffTce means it is likely to diop many of the Azams' customers, in an area which relies heavily on benefit payments, shopped after cashing their giros next door. Even before the unrest made national headlines, joyriding and other crime was common in the area. But Mr Azam knew real trouble was imminent last Thursday when he saw plac- ards in his street announcing: \"Scotchsy Riots 8pm\". He received three anonymous tele- phone calls from people doing him a favour by warning him that his shop and home might be burned down. He removed all his business documents from the flat, vis- ited his bank and accountant, rang his insurance company in Bristol to confirm that his pol- icy was in order and took the family's few heirlooms and his youngest children to a rela- tive's home. He expected no help from the police. Instead, some local peo- pie came to sit out the night with him in case the property Sid to be defended. Geordie-speaking but Asian- looking, he says he has sus- fered racial abuse from the police in the past, and has found them very reluctant to become involved. Mr Azam is not alone among traders in the area in conclud- ing that the police are of little help. A younger shopkeeper, who has been in Scotswood for more than a decade, but who is .not from Tyneside, says it i aste of time nvolng them and it wins no friet first, when e edsorted out the ,tro bleri*ieives, but we don't ra any trouble, so .we et'or ele to sort it out.

But he thinks that would be difficult for any newomer to do now, in the bitter aftermath of the riots. Meanwhile Mr Azam, ser- vently hoping the disorder was over, was yesterday stocking up from a cash-and-carry. He explains his driving work ethic partly by the need to marry off his four daughters in style, but also by his upbringing. \"My father told me: 'God gave you hands 'and legs. You don't live off the state, that's only for disabled people.'\" Many of his .customers do not see it that way. Nor do his own two sons. Aged 24 and -1, they have never been in trouble, but nei- ther has ever had a job. \"They aren't bothered,\" says their bewildered father. Their mother adds: \"Maybe the kids get it too easy.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Chris. Tighe THE EAST Durham Task Force, a lobbying body which aims to win Â£158m investment from the government and the European Commission over the next 10 years for one of England's declining coalfield areas, was launched yesterday. Durham County Council has set up the task force with help from the government, British Coal, English Estates (the gov- ernment's commercial property developer) and local training and regeneration agencies. It estimates that 8,000 jobs must be created over the next decade if the East Durham coalfield is to have any pros- pect of recovery. Since 1981, the area has lost nearly 10,000 mining jobs, and last week British Coal con- firmed that by March next year it intends to close Murton col- liery, one of only three pits still working in East Durham. That will result in a further 950 job losses. The rundown of mining has resulted not only in rising unemployment but also popu- lation decline and a poor image, compounded by derelic- tion and colliery waste tipping. The county council believes that in the fight for govern- ment and European aid East Durham has lost out to towns such as Consett, which sus- fered a single main closure, and Tyne and Wear and Tees- side, which have their own development corporations. - Tihebtsklo rcewa ntso/ium- ulate advance' reclamation, improvements an training and improve road links.

   "text_content" : "MR KENNETH BAKER, the home secretary, yesterday called for greater insurance incentives to curb car crime. They might include lower pre- miums for security-conscious drivers. He said after meeting the Association of British Insurers (ABI): \"Present levels of of car crime are alarming and unac- ceptable.\" He added that it was in the insurers' interest to encourage owners to do all they can to prevent car crime. Proposals discussed included reduced premiums for drivers. who have security syrstems fit- ted, and betteri insurance rat- Mr Baker said that riots in Newcastle upon Tyne and Oxford had \"highlighted how car crime can lead to death, injury and disorder.\" He added: \"I am determined that every- thing possible is done to crack this serious crime.\" Thefts of cars and from cars accounts for a third of all crime and costs the insurance industry an estimated Â£500m a year, according to Home Office figures published last week. The recent rise in thefts of high-performance cars has prompted some insurers to raise premiums by up to 80 per cent. Mr Baker welcomed the ABrs new enlarged car group rating system which will take into account a model's security features for the first time when it is introduced iext month. \"Tilier clearly is progress. Full. co-olerttidn from the iiisurance ind ry and the manufacturers'. . . is essen- tial if we are to reverse this growing trend. I am confident that this will, be achieved by concentrated efforts on all fronts.\""

   "text_content" : "ike most owners of pri- vate businesses, the directors of Interna- tional ood Machinery (ISM) were not particularly keen to dilute their holding by selling off shares. But when they weighed up their options for strengthening the finances of their fast-growing business earlier this year they realised there were limits on their choice of action. The banks were growing increasingly concerned at their exposure to the small firms sector and were calling in loans rather than increasing facilities. At the same time, ISM, a two-year-old company which buys and sells mainly second-hand food processing equipment, was already fairly highly geared. \"If we had been able to get a bank loan we would have gone for it,\" says Rashmi Chauhan, finance director. \"It is better than giving up equity. But we were in the period leading up to banks announcing their results (which showed many making large provisions to cover losses on small business loans). We also felt that the amount we wanted was proba- bly too much for a bank any- way.\" John Holroyd, founder and managing director of ISM, and his fellow directors solved their financing dilemma by agreeing to issue Â£1.25m worth of ordinary and preference shares to County NatWest Ven- tures, the venture capital arm of National Westminster Bank. These shares gave County Nat- West a stake of around 20 per cent in the Bath-based busi- ness, which expects pre-tax profits to rise from Â£800,000 to more than Elm on turnover up from from Â£4.1m to Â£5m this year. ISM is just one of a growing number of unlisted companies which is now prepared to con- sider issuing equity to outside investors instead of simply increasing borrowings. This development mirrors the recent trend among quoted stock market companies to strengthen their finances by means of rights issues. Three main factors have con- tributed to this change in the unquoted company sector: * Bank attitudes have hard- ened in response to the losses which they have suffered on their small business custom- ers. \"The banks are putting on the pressure,\" says Richard Hargreaves, managing director of Baronsmead, a venture cap- ital company. \"The banks have stopped providing what is in effect equity at overdraft rates Ce 24---&6 11 -o.- \"164114- T m-- n Holroyd: looking to venturo capital to trongthtn flinusc Rauiyl Cnaunan (M ton, assistant director in County NatWest Ventures' Bristol office. * The length of the recession coupled with signs it is now coming to an end. \"The harsh- ness of the recession has forced companies to consider strengthening their capital base,\" says Trevor Jones, man- aging director of Gresham Trust, a venture capital com- pany. \"During the recession, businesses were just trying to stay afloat; now that it is eas- ing they have the opportunity to think strategically,\" says Hargreaves. 0 A slight but perceptible change in the attitude of small business owners to the idea of retaining complete control of their companies. Grahame Par- ish, managing director of Tiger Books, a distributor of remain- dered books, raised Elm from Baronsmead after weighing up whether to stay small or go for growth. Expansion of the busi- ness was initially financed by Parish's own funds and bank borrowings and later by factor- ing his invoices. \"Equity was the third stage of growth,\" he says. Sales have since doubled to a projected Â£6m this year while profits have risen three- fold. \"Private companies are more willing to consider issuing equity,\" says Paul Brooks, managing director of Pruden- tial Venture Managers. \"There- are a lot of deals in the pipe- line.\" \"We are seeing quite well run private companies which have decided to give up a bit of equity to fatten their capital base,\" comments Jones. The willingness to consider issuing equity increases if a company is considering a pub- lic listing. A.S. Budge, a large but still privately owned civil engineering and mining com- pany, raised Â£20m of equity from Prudential Venture Man- agers and Charterhouse Devel- opment Capital last January to finance growth and strengthen its balance sheet. Budge, with annual sales of just over Â£250m is looking for a future flota- tion, says Mike Connolly, finance director. By signing up equity investors, a private company gets access to sinan- cial expertise and a gentle introduction to the art of deal- ing with outside shareholders. Jones says the quality of company seeking to raise equity has improved but other venture capitalists are not con vinced. Peter Shortt invest- ment manager at GLE Develop ment Capital says a lot of businesses are looking at ven- ture capital to raise finance but not many deals are being completed. \"It goes against the grain for venture capitalists simply to replace bank debt with equity.\" The need to involve the bank closely in the negotiations to inject equity is just one of the areas which the company's directors, as well as the ven- ture capitalist, need to keep in mind. It is not unknown for a bank manager to withdraw loan facilities when he sees that a company has raised finance from other sources. Other points which need watching are: * The timing of negotiations. Do not leave a decision on rais- ing equity finance until it is too late. It should not take much longer to negotiate an equity package than it does to raise a large slab of additional bank finance, says Brooks, but a company only weakens its negotiating position by waiting until its finances are under strain. If the deal is a \"fire sale\" the venture capitalist will be able to put pressure on the company. * The structure of the deal. While the selling point of the venture capital industry is its ability to provide equity, much of the finance provided does not take the form of ordinary shares. Loan notes and redeem- capitalot ofithese two forms of XiDBU-ueIs htt provide a Aui 0rte trin theotm\",Of FT payments olfn the bai pats and dividends on the - shares. At the -hme ttie -they allow the venture capitalist to reduce his expo- Ssure t the company as the lan Is repaid or the prffl are Many people regard loan notes a quasi-equity because ty represent for the lender a risk approaching that of true equity. Loan notes are usually unsecured and rank for ,ay- mnent after secured \"senior\" debt. An important advantage of loan notes to the borrower is that interest payments may be set against tax. But the bank manager will not treat them as equity for the purpose of calcu- lating how much he is pre- pared to lend against assets. Preference shares, in con- trast, do count towards a busi- ness's equity base though divi- dend payments cannot be set against tax. Press will usually be in redeemable form: that is, repayable by the borrower over a period of years. Equity itivestors want to invest as much as possible in redeemable form so that they are not locked into company for too long, says Andrew Cur- tis of Baronsmead. If the inves- tor has a sizeable ordinary share investment in a company and there are problems in arr- anging a sale or flotation he may find himself trapped in an unattractive investment. Redeemable press are popu- lar because they offer a com- promise between the needs of both investor and the investee company. The company has the benefit of equity which can in turn be used to increase bank borrowings, while the investor has flexibility. * Planning the next stage. Most venture capitalists want to know when they will get their money back. The direc- tors of the company raising money must make sure they know what the venture capital- ists expect of them and plan to find a replacement investor, to be sold or floated on the stock market. \"There will be a few sharp intakes of breath at board meetings in the future when the directors discover the ven- ture capitalist wants to get out,\" warns Shortt. Companies which raise equity in the pres- ent harsh economic climate must be careful they do not limit their options when the better times come."

   "text_content" : "enlpnp\"entto16 private rsinomes and hospitals buslneu by National Health regional supply centres whidh are tudercutting them. on The small firms say ita the only way that the NHS orgni- ,iationi sellingt t the private market can- charge lower pries Is because they do not fully take account of their costs. NHS oficials assert that all costs are properly allocated though they didissue new guidelines lat.t March follow- ing a series of complaints. The NHS Procurement Direc- torate said that the complaints were coming from suppliers who had previously made large profits in niche markets where they were now facing tougher competition from a more efficient supplier. \"We are losing markets to the health authorities,\" said Nigel Lockett, managing direc- tor of Hygeil Care, a Skipton, Yorkshire based supplier of dressings and incontinence products with sales of Â£l.lm. \"We cannot compete on price because the NHS suppliers don't account for their true costs yet it is my taxes which they are using to get estab- lished.\" \"The area health authorities are selling certain products at prices we cannot even buy at,\" said Peter Boultby, managing director of Industricare, a Shepshed, Leicestershire com- pany with Elm sales and 13 employees. \"It is unfair compe- tition and it could put us out of business.\" The case for the smaller wholesalers has been taken up by the British Surgical Trades Association, representing nearly 200 companies. The association said the National Audit Office, which is due to start a pilot study of income generation activities in the NHS, had agreed to take its concerns into consideration. An attempt by the small wholesalers to interest the Office of Fair Trading in its claims was unsuccessful though the OFT appeared will- ing to accept there might be a problem over costs. \"What you seem to have in mind is rather a case of inefficient allocation of costs,\" the OFT wrote in August. \"In the absence of .Uitl?-cPm tiive evidence At\"sldprovetobe a temn- perpry problem -as the orgmn- bation 4evelops procedures a piwa at.e to its new role.\" : ~~The rbleof NHS bohpe- Stitioin fors\"uQppesof medical pnd-abo,41 roducts arose foliowing the passing of the Health and ;Medicina Act in 988, .which allows health oauthoriti to sell goods and s-iics at a profit to custom- a outnside the NHS. Complaints fom some sup pliers of medical equipment and grocery Items that the NHS was selling on products and undercutting the original manufacturer prompted the new guidelines last March. The suppliers' grievances appear to have been resolved but problems now ceptre on the small wholesalers of medical sup- plies.Selling outside the NHS \"needs to be conducted on an explicit basis of fair competi- tion and of avoiding undue damage to the interests and core business of the NHS or to NHS relationships with suppli- ers and the wider market place in which the NHS has to oper- ate,\" the guidelines state. Records of private sale activ- ity is to be maintained in the form of what are known as memorandum trading accounts. \"These will be in a standard form which detail total value of sales, direct and indirect costs and gross and net profit. This will ensure that sales to non-NHS organi- sations involve no subsidy and are being conducted in accor- dance with these guidelines. For re-selling activities these accounts will be monitored once a year by the procure- ment directorate.\" Small medi- cal wholesalers are concerned, however, that these memoran- dum trading accounts will not be made public. The accounts of one NHS supplier, set up as an independent company and hence required to file accounts at Companies' House, are not reassuring, the wholesalers maintain. The accounts of S&S (South- port), part of the Southport and Formby Health Authority, showed that the company had sales of Â£317,773 in the year ended March 1990 and made a loss of Â£91. Lockett says there are several details of the Fnteinnt r-whirh rNmn-n him. The accounts show that the company paid qout WP6M in manageent charge bat although it had six rdlr u it paid no dIlnctnc'Semunera- tln.It ial pid' ust S9 in bank charges in the year. Douglas Murray, managing director of S4S (Southport) said: \"Everything is. totaly costed in the company and we have accountants and audi- tors. We operate, on hospital premises for which we pay rents and rates while we also have a separate phone. The department of health came to us 18 months ago. They went through us to see we were doing it correctly and at the end of the day they wished us all the best.\" Turning to the specific issues raised by Iockett, Mur- ray said the lack of payment to directors .was because \"we don't pay directors' remunera- tion\". Murray said that he did not know why the bank charge was so low. \"I suspect that when we ruled off the end of the year the charges might not have come in.\" T. Luxton, the NHS official who acts as a contact point for NHS supplies organisations with queries about the guide- lines, said they had been drawn up after discussions with other wholesalers and trade associations. \"This is intended as a mar- ginal activity and all the indi- cations are that that is what it is. You have a small number of vociferous wholesalers who have always conducted them- selves in small niche markets. They have a comfortable little niche in, for example, nursing homes. They now find they have a more efficient whole- saler coming in and they can- not compete. The NHS is tak- ing all costs into account.\" One NHS region had calcu- lated that its total on-cost to make sales was 10 to 11 per cent compared with some other wholesalers who based their prices on costings of 45 per cent, Luxton noted. \"We are not saying that the NHS will wipe out other wholesalers but there are some at the margin who will suffer when a new wholesaler comes in. With the recession, private nursing homes and hospitals are looking around to cut their costs. The regional supply centres are run on a pretty efficient, 24-hour basis.\"",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "In thefifth ile f publid s9p ding on research and deviopment- throughout the world, Kevin Brown-examines how therAustralian government is aiming to revitalise the.e:country's scientific endeavour Nearly 30 years ago, Donald Hore, the Australian social critic, observed in a famous book that Australia was \"a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people wholshare-its luck\". Home's book, The Lucky Country, was meant as a warn- ing that Australian wealth would not last without funda- mental changes in the Austra- lian way of life. It was hugely influential, but not in the way he-intended. Rarely read but widely quoted, its title came to encapsulate the view that Aus- tralians would always enjoy a high standard of living, regard- less of events. History has proved Hone correct. Once the world's rich- est country in terms of per cap- ita GDP, Australia has now slipped to 17th among the 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It was this relative economic decline which led Bob Hawke's federal Labor government to sweep away many of the regu- latory and protectionist devices which had insulated Australia from the world since the continent's six former Brit- ish colonies achieved nation- hood in 1901. As part of that programme of structural change, the Hawke govern- ment has now turned its atten- tion to the scientific and educa- tional framework which actuaJly riung. wrir @06oes mean, working siarter - workig 'more effectively, innew materials, sew prm ducton technologies and new management tools. It means being, like Germany and Japan, a clever country.\" Few have argued with Hawke's central case, that Aus- tralia must develop more and better skills if it is to compete in world markets. But there is plenty of scepticism about the ability of the Clever Country programme to achieve that goal. Barry Jones, a former Labor science minister, says there is a \"slick, facile quality about the word 'clever', as if all we needed was a quick fix.\" As Jones points out, Austral- ians have always had a reputa- tion for resourcefulness: \"We could fix up a leaking water tank ... with chewing-gum, and do clever things with fenc- ing wire. But in the age of micro-electronics, these skills are no longer particularly rele- vant,\" he says. Others have pointed out that the Clever Country analysis was first put forward by Home in 1964. He wrote: \"Throughout the world the basis of material prosperity in the future is likely to lie, for the first time in history,. with clever, edu- cated people. The need to build up a certain kind of cleverness will cause great social tensions in all industrialised countries; but especially in Australia, where cleverness can be con- sidered un-Australian.\" Home has resisted pointing out that the delay of 27 years between his analysis and the prime minister's announce- ment tends to prove his point. The root of Australia's prob- lem is that its economy differs from most other developed countries because of its depen- dence on relatively low-tech- nology industries like mining and agriculture, which account for around 80 per cent of exports. Also, most companies are small by the standards of S a nad Noto brt low7 and mediunitechhologY iniijttries, wbhile muitiiationalh companies are reluctant to commit research and develop meat funds to Australian branch offices or subsidiaries. Thids seems unlikely to change. The Australian Science and Techiology Council (Astec),a \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t government advisory body, concluded in its report The Core Capacity of Australian Science and Technology that: \"While transnational firms can be induced, through subsidies and suasion, to perform more of their R&D in Australia and to form linkages with local firmnns, it seems unlikely that this will lead to the develop- ment of an Australian high- tech sector with characteristics similar to those of other small OECD countries which perform well in these areas.\" The government's strategy has been to concentrate on encouraging companies to develop techniques which will *edd vaoioneail^t cntific at I, com shasaCo-pratve s;aetag. Tvia as bee.s upo roote senin g lnk ween iseletirandh govern- moent esearch agenCes such as the Commonwealth Scientific ad Industrial Research Organ- isation (CSIRO). A series of Co-operative Research Centres is being set up-to promote joint public/pri- vats isector rdearch. and the agencies have also been a required to fund part of their A activities from non-govern- ment sources. At the state I i level, the government has I encouraged South Australian I e proposals for a new suburb of 1 100,000 people in Adelaide, i I known as the multi-function t t polis, where it is hoped foreign i and Australian businesses will i establish a cluster of private- i s sector research organisations, I partly stimulated by the state c government's technology pur- chasing programme. f Ross Free, the federal sci- ence minister, says the strat- ) egy is working \"reasonably i I well\", pointing to an average ( --------------- 4: lult te ofm rothb inbusrines ^p'centharye arealso soiMe 1ih, proie s uccess stor-oie suh *'ainid .n annual * rat6e''ofpo gwth thf 7 per seaont a.rga; unn tie irmbeir of overseas patent ap1pications made byAustial ais - t*e biWemtUrpwt '\"t orany OECP country. - There are alsb' some high. profile success storiessuch as the CSIRO's, joint pro gramm with. Queensland Metals to increase the value of produc- tion from its magnesite mnin- north of Rockhampton from A$60 (Â£27.70) a tonne for the raw material to A$600 a tonne for magnesite bricks, and i potentially to A$4,000 a tonne i for refined metal exports. I \"When you consider our vul- , nerability to fluctuations in t the price of our major exports, which tend to be either what we can grow or dig up, it is a major concern that quite a lot of our economic problems could have been avoided had we devoted greater efforts to adding value,\" Free says. However, there are doubts about the government's com- mitment to providing its share of the funds to ensure that the 'iÂ·pÂ·Prpti peakoeA$ 17/ r idato eaLi7m last year IdHinqÂ·s a tc 17/8 to Aslat1784/8 last year a . t y isA$62m, implying V aiieffective'cut in the govern. , ept! subsidy of 21 per cent over four years. The overall gederal government budget for t r support will rise by 4.3 perc nt year to A$2.607bn, . nerly double the expenditure in the goveirinent's irst year ini office in 198/84. a However, *the trend looks a lessimpresaive using constant S1984/85 prices. .On this basis, the current year's budget is e equivalent to A$1.692bn, an increase- of just 1.2 per cent since .spending peaked in 1986/ 87 at A$1.671bn. Spending fell heavily between 1986/87 and 1991/92, bottoming at A$1.549bn in 1968/89. The government's contribu- tion to R&D spending has been falling steadily as a percentage of GDP, from 0.76 per cent in 1984/85 to 0.67 per cent in 1988/ 89, the latest year for which figures are available. Over the same period, business spending has increased from 0.32 per cent to 0.52 per cent of GDP, indicating that the strategy of shifting the burden to private industry is having some effect. Over the same period, total spending on R&D has increased from 1.12 per cent of GDP to 1.23 per cent. However, total spending has fallen after peaking at 1.26 per cent in 1986/87, and is still below the level of 1968/69, when spending stood at 1.33 per cent of GDP. As Jones pointed out in Parlia- ment: \"This is not a promising start for an explosive growth in Australia's capacity to pro- duce high value added exports.\" Hawke will have a chance to increase the government's I commitment to R&D next May when he steps up the Clever Country initiative with the publication of Australia's first white paper on science policy. So far there is little indication of what he will say, other than to call for further increases in business spending. However, ministers are playing down expectations that government spending will be increased. \"It will be more a broad statement of principle,\" says Free. The series will continue next week by focusing on Germany.",

   "text_content" : "Dy David Sawrs -. 'n _< ak. PT ihe European: Comnnl- :siop has an old-fash- J ioned attitude towards' ItheAelectronics industry: It believ'e. that European owner- ship iAs necessary to ensure that the users of its products can obtaih the most utodate devices, that large.firms are vital to competitiveness in this industry, that size achieved by merger can be equated with- size obtained by growth, and that protection or support for research can enhance competi- tiveness. It also assumes that ability to manufacture the dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) is the yardstick of suc- cess. This analysis is static for an industry that is dynamic, in which success depends upon rapid reaction to competitive pressures and technological opportunities, and in which recent innovations have facili- tated the provision of devices designed for specific uses, such as application specific inte- grated circuits (Asics). These latter innovations reduce the users' dependence on a few suppliers of the latest products. Output of these specialised devices is rising much faster than that of the D-Ram, which they can in some cases replace; and output of D-Rams is now smaller than that of the more specialised chips. It is therefore rather surprising that so much importance is placed on the ability to make D-Rams - especially when the cost of entry is high and when suc- cessful production relies heavily on experience in mak- ing memory chips. If it was ever true that the European suppliers of elec- tronic devices played a strate- gic role in the success of Euro- pean industry, it is not true today. If the European electronics equipment industry is continu- ing to fall behind its foreign rivals, its failure reflects inabil- ity to cope as well as its rivals with the possibilities for inven- tion and innovation in the industry. Its weakness seems to lie in the technical, manage- rial and especially the entre- preneurial abilities of its employees. European compa- nies seem to have been unwill- ing to take as many risks as their rivals, and unable to QUEST COLUMN develop, manufacture and mar- ket their products as effec- tively. Efforts to improve the com- petitiveness of the European industry by supporting collabo- rative research have failed: companies, it is said, have failed to exploit the results. So it is suggested that the EC, or national governments, should support the exploitation pro- cess, protect European markets more effectively, or encourage mergers to produce larger com- panies. These steps, unfortunately, would do nothing to correct the weaknesses of the Euro- pean industry, which are related to 'its personnel rather than its finances. Attempts to improve the per- formance of the electronics equipment industry by govern- ment support should therefore be abandoned rather than extended. The European com- panies should be left to find their own level, because the individual skills of their staff will be the main determinants of their success in this fast- moving industry. It is simply foolish for gov. ernments or the Commission to seek to increase the scale of these companies' activities, when governments cannot determine the skills of their employees. The sad old dogmas of strate- gic products and industries should be left buried in the past; the highly competitive electronic component indus- tries of Japan and the US can best supply the needs of Euro- pean users. It is the existence of competi- tion in the world industry that is the real protection of Euro- pean users, not self-sufficiency within Europe. The author is an economic con- sultant Z /",

That was a wasie there armore ta peokwho Eadndp d have dthIs performace wholly It was cleverly mt up by the preceding works. Exactly as In one of eon Botstein's Mendelssohn Festival concerts which I reported last week, the pice de rdsistance by the Master came after three \"overtures\" by his once-famous elders and contemporaries, thus demonstrating the Master's superior genius In the most vivid and Immediate way. Here, the luckless supporting acts were by Boleldiea, Chermbini and Mdhul - but I exaggerate: Cherubini's Overture Les deux journes, at least, is sharply imagined and very well-made. It sounded the more so after the Zorame et Zulnar Overture by Boleldieu, a piece of outstanding musical vapidity. Swallowed as a canap6, the latter went down easily enough, thanks to its naively disarming orchestral colours. Gardiner and his players also put the best face on Mehul's overture for La chasse dujune Henri which displays an acquaintance with two or three more chords than Boieldien but depends chiefly and repetitively upon quaint hunting-horn effects. After such stuff, the Symphoniefantastique seemed more than ever a Pandora's box of unpredictable, explosive ideas. In this thrilling performance, it was impossible to disentangle the contribution made by the piquant \"period\" timbres of the band from Gardiner's own sympathetic input. Obviously he could draw a brilliant account of the work from a modem symphony orchestra too (though he thinks the standard sonorities now are \"tentonised, americnised, On the other hand, if the periodsounds aren't absolutely essential they certainly ensure clarity and pungent character for distinct musical lines, with the bonus of guiding our modem ears toward elements of the score that we scarcely hear any longer. The kazooish bassoon-sound was a clear asset, lighter and odder than the lush modern kind, and the fact that nearly all the old instruments were softer than their new cousins meant that a utti could be just as forceful (on that scale) as a modem one, but without the familiar blot-out glare. Nevertheless, a \"period\"-style performance can also be as bland and faithless as a moder onee; Gardiner's superbly prepared, insight-laden account was the opposite of that Every movement had marvellous strokes (and subtle touches), but the opening \"Reveries and Passions\" achieved a barely-controlled Berliodan wildness with hair-raising fidelity.

   "text_content" : "Three new series begin tonight The six-part Lawyer (8.80 C4) sounds the most unusual. A film crew has recorded the progress of several cases as they are handled by solidi- tors and barristers, and these are cut together in a manner similar to that used in \"HUll Street Blues\" where several p()ots were always on the boiL The cases introduced today involve an attempted suicide in police custody, a British inquest on a woman who died in a Portu- guee Jacuzzi, and a burglary. Adult, which is to say sceptical, viewers will approach Bottom cau- tiously. Ade Edmondson and Rik ayi roved in \"Tie Yfoura Ores\" and \"Filthy Rich And Catflap\" that while they are capable of occasional flashes of lunatic brilliance which almost (but never quite) match the standards set by The Goons, they also suffer chronically from pee-po- belly-bum-drawers syndrome. Let's hope that in this new series (9.00 BlC2) they are less easy a themselves. Also on BBC2 is The Dreaded Lurgi (9.30), devoted to \"health - a universal obsession\".

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "'Bathtub Collage', 1963, by Tom Wesselman and 'Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians', 1965, by David Hockney I - showed my work in public was at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition 1963, and it just happened to be a painting of Marilyn Monroe. The Academy's principal offering for the autumn, The Pop Art Show (Burlington House, Piccadilly W1, until December 15: sponsored by Mercury Communications in association with The Independent), is for me, therefore, one of considerable interest, and mixed feelings besides. In this I doubt that I am alone. For artists of my own generation, whose time at art school and early maturity filled the decade roughly between 1955 and 1965, Pop Art has always been peculiarly significant. It is not that we even thought of it as Pop Art - and indeed the label was attached to it comparatively late - but whether we liked it or not, that rich package of reference and response, superficial, hedonistic, ironical or what you will, was something with which we all had to come to terms. What it made available to us was nothing especially new, nothing that dadaists, surrealists, cubists and constructivists had not somehow contrived between them long before. Here again were the collage, the assemblage, the bizarre conjunction, the secondary reference by way of photographic or other printed material. But suddenly it all seemed to come together at once, the moment fixed and enlivened by that sudden surge in awareness at a conscious level of the forces of mass communication and entertainment. The map of our creative world was now redrawn: here be Films Stars, here Advertisements, Comics, Popular Music, Shop Windows, Pdckages and Graphic Design, Junk and Kitsch, and all to be taken not as just another formal element in the larger scheme of Art, but for its own sake on its own terms, all legitimate, all grist to the mill. This large survey at the Academy is well-timed, with enough now of historical perspective and yet not so late as to seem overdue. It is beautifully installed, immediately attractive and enjoyable. Given the nature of the material, it is hard to see how it could fail to be so; and here a doubt creeps in. With such ease of presentation does there come a certain glibness? Does it all flatter rather to deceive? Such fault as there is attaches not to the Academy for putting on the show, nor to the artists, though we shall come back to them, but to the selection of the work and the emphasis laid upon it by the organisers. That perhaps is to credit them with too much of the positive. Where we might have hoped for a true reassessment and proper historical analysis, with all of fresh insight and surprise they may afford, what we get is the story as before, with the European contribution neglected, the British patronised and the American complacently accorded a pre-eminence that seems increasingly shaky and undeserved. The problem is, as with every supposed Art Movement there ever was, that the narrow, precise or hermetic vfew grows ever nore blurred and indistinct the harder we look at it. As for the individual artists within any such movement, the more interesting they become for their mutual variance and development in the longer term. Thus to lump the American and European varieties of Pop Art together with so light a critical judgment is misleading and unfair. But, it being done, distinctions must be drawn. In general terms, the American work tends towards the open and public statement, immediate, consciously superficial and banal, independent of historical reference or continuity. The technique is often mechanical, often perfunctory and indifferent. The image is there, to be taken or left as it is, like the poster on the wall. Taken to Warhol's ironical and ambiguous extreme, this can be interesting and even important. Johns too, in the dark repetitive intensity of his early work, and Lichtenstein by his formal consistency, remain significant. For the rest Larry Rivers still disappoints for never having resolved what his graphic talent proposed, while the slipshod arrogance of Rauschenberg, the one note of Oldenburg's one soft idea, and Rosenquist's large-scale hamfistedness, are merely tiresome. European Pop Art is, by contrast, set in the modernist tradition and quite independent in its sources, references and chronology, of American example, for all that its material may well be American. The formal example is cubist, dadaist and surrealist collage, Ernst, Schwitters and Picasso, the freedom that to bring all manner of demotic material into aesthetic use. That freedom too the Americans had, but here the mood was personal and reflective, consciously ambiguous in its jokiness and irony. The British work is also, almost without exception, better made. There are of course parallels to draw, for contemporaneity is always a kind of complement, but to set Allen Jones, for example, against Tom Wesselmann or Mel Ramos, Kitaj against Rivers, Caulfield against Lichtenstein, Peter Blake against Jim Dine, Paolozzi against Ray Johnson, is to demonstrate a technical superiority, to say nothing of material richness and qualitative difference, that has still to be more generally acknowledged. There are, of course, many gaps - no Nigel Henderson, no Michael Andrews, no Dubuffet. The European element is indeed sadly inadequate, and a thorough examination of the relation between le nouveau realisme and the incipient British Pop Art of the 1950s is now more necessary than ever. But Art is not a competition, and American Pop Art stands in its own right as of considerable art-historical moment. The mistake is only to see Pop Art as essentially American in context and reference: the pity only that the opportunity for a more discursive, generous and fairly comparative examination of it, in all its manifestations, has been missed. A show dominated by LUchtenstein, Rauschenberg, Oldenburg and, above them all, Andy Warhol, is all very well, but not even half the story.",

   "text_content" : "The Japan Festival is now poised to embrace British arts- lovers with a physical generos- ity of bulk otherwise reserved for the Sumo wrestler. It must be difficult to decide how to open a festival as wide in its scope as this one and the organisers were fortunate that their choice of the first orches- tral concert turned out so well The Saito Kinen Orchestra impressed audiences in this country last year and last night's concert entertained no slip in its standards. A single Japanese morsel was added to the menu that other European cities will be enjoying on the orchestra's tour. Takemitsu's Requiem for Strings probably seemed an apt opener as mark- ing a point where Japanese and Western musical styles meet (a substantial retrospec- tive of Takemitsu's music at the Barbican is one of the festi- val's main attractions). But this expressive music really belongs well to the Western side of the border and its yearning spirit is reminiscent more of Mahler than anything else. The main reason for includ- ing it, aside from giving a polite nod to the Japanese theme, will have been the opportunity this short piece provides for the Saito Kinen's string players to shine. There are a few more European faces in the ranks than there were before, those in the wind sec- tion very distinguished, but it is still the orchestra's glowing strings that are its chief glory. As on its last visit, the orchestra came primarily to play Brahms under the direc- tion of Seiji Ozawa. This time the symphonies were the Sec- ond and Third, but the warmth of the sound and the clarity of the wind playing that Ozawa gets to sing through even when his rich strings are in action were just as remembered before. The evening started slowly. The Third Symphony passed by with almost nothing beyond the excellence of the playing to involve the listener, until Ozawa whipped up some pace in the finale, a recurring sea- ture which has started to seem part of his game-plan. But after the interval the Second Symphony was quite another matter. Instead of indi- vidual lyrical phrases or out- bursts from the brass catching the attention, here was a fully thought-through performance, sweeping the imagination away with the impassioned delivery of the whole. Ozawa has given us nothing better. The performance was also gloriously well played. The members of the Saito Kinen Orchestra only come together for a few months each year and each performance by them has a cachet that genuinely war- rants the festival tag. Richard Fairman Jazz giants remembered Two concerts devoted to remembering the hugely influ- ential jazz musicians Sidney Bechet and Benny Goodman take place at the Purcell Room on Saturday September 28. The first, at 5.30, re-creates the music of soprano-saxist Bechet and clarinettist Milton \"Mezz\" Mezzrow and features Brian White's King Jazz. The second, at 8.30, features the music of Benny Goodman, played by the Dave Shepherd septet. I I I 1n *",

   "text_content" : "The Salisbury Festival saw the preitert of Dorothy Tutin's solo sow, Le Fanal Bleu, about the french dancer -and novelist, Sidonie-Gabriel Col- ette. Her tempestuous life (1873-1954) offers all manner of delights for the biographer, devisor or actor. But this ver- sion of olette was the greatest disappointment, principally because so many opportunities were lost or squandered in a flat-paced, anodyne account. There are two problems with Barbara Neil's script, taken from Colette's autobiographical writings in Earthly Paradise. First, it comes from one source, so that while one , learns much of Colette, the i show takes the form of a lec- ture rather than a dramatic account of her life. Second, Neil's selection of material sets out to counter the image of Colette as the scandalous music-hall dancer by present- ing the pained novelist; but she over-compensates and presents Colette as dull and priggish. Colette married in 1893 and first appeared in the Paris gos- sip columns in a first-night audience of Maeterlinck's ver- sion of TIs Pity She's a Whore. A publishing friend coaxed her into the Claudine novels, spic- ier with each rewriting. When Colette unshackled herself from Henri Gauthier-Villars, her music-critic husband, she danced in gold tights through the provinces and into the best Paris salons before she turned novelist and chronicler of the time in Le Matin. She married again, in 1912 and 1935. While Neil's script tells something of this, it fails to convey the excitement of the time. However, there are some wonderful moments created solely by Colette's prose: the sensuousness of a cat awaking from an afternoon sleep heavy with the scent of tomato splants, or the horror of Col- hette's experiences with the wounded during the war. Dorothy Tutin looked uncomfortable and read - not altogether fluently - from Col- ette's blue writing-paper. The period costume and set were welcome enhancements. Her Colette dutifully delivered the best-known lines about life, including sound advice which applies to anyone thinking of seeing this show in its present version - 'look long at what pleases you, and longer still at what gives you pain.\" Andrew St George",

   "text_content" : "The first London visit in 20 years by New York's Ridiculous Theatrical Company is an occasion for some mirth but little joy. Their Camille, archly sub-titled \"a tearjerker\", is a tawdry tranvestite version of Dumas' Parisian melodrama La Dame aux Camslias which leaves no double-entendre unturned. The title role, created by the company's founder-director Charles Ludlam, is inherited by his successor Everett Quinton, who works every line into such a frenzy of moues and manners that he drains the story of the joie de vivre, and the emotional manipulation which is surely responsible for the enduring appeal of Dumas' consumptive courtesan. It is not that there is anything wrong with burlesque, just that the whole evening would be so much funnier if only it were a little less strenuous and cynical. The three acts (with two intervals) proceed with little variety of tone or tempo. In the desperate gaiety of the first one, a rococo gargoyle of a baron (H.M. Koutoukas) thumps at a little piano as the bright lights of the demi-monde twinkle away in bails of costumier's best. The frocks, at least, are seriously outrde in a style that would do credit to the panto at Clacton-on-Sea, while the hanks of stage jewellery quite outshine verbal gems (\"Me fall in love? No, no Nichette\"). To be fair, there is a genuine attempt to tell the story. Camille, discovered at her Auteil hideaway decked out like a strawberry tart, submits to society's pressure to abandon her lover and throws herself back into the baron's lascivious arms before repairing to her deathbed, from where she gasps some of the play's funniest, and most pointed, dialogue. In the era of Aids, there is an obvious resonance in her cry: \"I have lived for love and now I am dying for it\" - if only the production would allow it to be felt. There were plenty of of people in the clubbish Drill Hall audience who seemed delighted by it all, but to me it seemed tacky and rather tedious. Claire Armitstead",

   "article_dc_title" : "Democracy in Hong Kong",
   "text_content" : "THE very fact that Hong Kong has taken its first step towards democracy with direct elec- tions to its Legislative Council is a welcome, if long overdue, development. But it would be an illusion to present them as ah unmitigated success, in spite of the understandable jubilation of the victorious United Democrats, led by the prominent barrister Mr Martin Lee. Under China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, adopted last year, Britain was made to accept conditions under which only 18 of \"Legco's\" 60 seats would be directly elected this year, rising to 20 in 1995 and no more than 30 in 2003. Moreover, the turnout of less than 40 per cent of the 50 per cent of the Hong Kong popula- tion who had registered to vote was a disappointment. It was hardly an effective rebuttal of the argument that indifference to the whole democratic pro- cess is widespread in Hong Kong. That does not alter the fact that the presence of even a limited number of elected rep- resentatives - Mr Lee's party and its liberal allies won 16 out of the 18 available seats - will provide some measure of insur- ance against the territory's public opinion being stifled when Britain gives up control in 1997. Certainly, the clamour in Hong Kong for more democ- racy will now grow louder. Mr Lee, who is equally critical of Britain and China, has already said clearly that his party, hav- ing received \"a mandate from the people\", is now entitled to have the majority of the repre- sentatives in Legco. That would entail a change in the present rules which provide for 42 members of the council to be nominated by the governor of Hong Kong or to be elected by professional groups. Herculean task Mr Lee can be relied upon to put pressure on the British government to try to persuade Beijing to improve the demo- cratic provisions of the Basic Law. This will be a Herculean task, given the difficulties already encountered by Lon- don in winning Beijing's accep- tance even of the present imperfect system. But the effort has to be made, not only to protect the rights and inter- ests of the people of Hong Kong after China takes over, but to demonstrate that Britain has not abandoned its respon- sibilities during the remaining years of its stewardship. The mistakes made over the building of Hong Kong's new airport must be not be repeated. Unrealistically, as it turned out, Hong Kong thought it could go it alone to build the airport, without full prior consultations with the Chinese authorities. In the end, however, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had to eat humble pie by going to Beijing to sign an agreement with the Chinese allowing the airport project to go ahead. Points of principle Yet the whole affair had its positive side as well. Mr Major proved with his outspoken advocacy of human rights in China that he was not fright- ened to provoke the wrath of the Chinese on points of princi- ple. The subsequent release by Peking of a leading Hong Kong dissident showed that such tac- tics can pay handsome divi- dends, though last week's expulsion of a British corre- spondent from Beijing cast the regime in its more invariable post-Tiananmen light. While issues affecting Hong Kong's future should be raised fully with the Chinese, Britain, too, should not hesitate to bring up matters it considers of vital importance in the regu- lar meetings at foreign minis- ter level which have been established specially for this purpose. China may dig in its heels on granting greater democracy for Hong Kong, as it did in the negotiations on the Basic Law last year. However, its obvious desire for Mr Major to visit Bei- jing showed that it desperately wanted to regain its interna- tional credentials. This remains an effective bargain- ing chip in Britain's hands. Greater democracy would provide the best chance for Hong Kong's long-term politi- cal and economic autonomy and would make it more diffi- cult for Beijing to perpetrate a Tiananmen-style crackdown. In the absence of an improved electoral system, Hong Kong will be left only with the highly uncertain hope of fun- damental political changes in China.",

   "text_content" : "IF THE UK had wanted to preserve the City of London's dominating position among Europe's capital markets, it should not have promoted lib- eralisation elsewhere. As it is, deregulation in other centres, encouraged forcefully by the European internal market pro- gramme, is helping to create more of an even playing field across the Continent, and encouraging competition for international business. Liberalisation elsewhere, not excessive regulation in Lon- don, explains the conclusion in a survey by the London Cham- ber of Commerce that London is set to lose out in relative - although not absolute terms - to other centres. Foreign banks, for example, are broadly content with the cur- rent levels of regulation. At one time, the fear was that the costs of the Financial Services Act would drive them out of town. But there is one strong mes- sage for policy-makers. Bank- ers are fed up with London's inadequate infrastructure, especially when it comes to transport, and think the capi- tal needs a governing body to co-ordinate its policymaking. They are right. London does need a strong and independent government. It should be allowed to raise taxes, not least from those who toil in the Square Mile, in order to pay for the improved infrastructure that is sought. Fares should also be raised; and the use of cars for commuting should be taxed. Are the bankers pre- pared to pay the piper, as well as call for the tune?",

   "text_content" : "LORD JUSTICE Woolfs report on the prison disturbances of April 1990 was published in February of this year. Together with the chief inspector of pris- ons Judge Stephen Tumim, he had investigated the riots which almost destroyed Stran- geways prison in Manchester and other UK penal establish- ments. His central proposition - that security and control should be balanced with justice and humanity - was widely welcomed. Some of Lord Justice Woolfs proposals were implemented immediately - for example, the censorship of letters was abolished for most prisoners. The home secretary ann- ounced that the degrading pro- cess of slopping out would be ended by December 1994, 15 months earlier than Lord Jus- tice Woolf had recommended. And the government could point with justification to its ambitions and expensive prison building programme to renedy the neglect of predeces- s--a over a long period.

   "text_content" : "the Ciihances of ladical reform of th upea Community's agraIctlure whichn July endorsed the plan of Mr Ray Macharry, the Irish agriculture ,oonmis- sioner, for the most tal overhaul of'the Conanon Agricultural Policy in its 80- year history, at last appears to have seized the initiative. If Brussels holds its nerve, and by a combinatiou, of stealth and boldness gets the substance of its new farm deal through the 12 member states, the consequences will be momentous. In substance, the complex plan can be summarised as the deepest price cuts the EC has ever contemplated, combined with full compensation to small and medium-sized farm- ers and scaled recompense to large farmers, contingent on the medium-to-large farms tak- ing significant swathes of land out of production. This was also the core of January's even more radical plan which caused a furore within the EC's powerful farming constit- uency. The main difference now is that compensation is much higher for big farmers - for which they can thank their agriculture ministers. But the refined plan would still produce manifold benefits: * The EC's structural over- production of food - running at about 20 per cent over needs - could gradually be brought under control. The wasteful mountains of beef, grains, but- ter and skimmed milk powder overhanging EC and world markets, depressing prices and lowering farm incomes, could slowly disappear. * The EC will have to spend more initially to save on the budget later. But most of the Community's 9m or so farmers would get stable incomes, which would be spread more equitably and help smaller farmers in particular. * EC consumers would get cheaper food. Last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, while agricul- ture got $49.3bn in support from the EC budget and national treasuries, consumers paid Community farmers a subsidy of $85.1bn. Some agri- cultural economists think con- sumers might save as much as a third of this - roughly equivalent to Ireland's gross domestic product. * The quality of the environ- ment would improve if the plan's provisions to reward less intensive farming are adopted. And the present struc- ture of rural society would stand a better chance of sur- vival if the Commission's ideas for controlling the exodus from the land, and using land for non-food purposes like for- estry, are agreed. * Negotiations in the Uru- guay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to free new sec- tors of world trade, now found- ering on the rock of farm trade subsidies, are more likely to be completed if the EC seriously means to reform the CAP. Moreover, a reformed farm regime is a sine qua non for the EC's enlargement, to include: the predominantly Nordic countries of the Euro- pean Free Trade Association and, eventually, post-commu- nist, agriculturally-rich coun- production,- 100 .. a1Faimntvalue added \" 70 - : 1975 1977 1976 1981 1983 1985 1987 88 iSouiSr Cpwan CowImIsrlon t i ,A ntarnt pries \" In reailierm tries such as Poland, Czecho- slovakia and Hungary. These three, now trying to negotiate association agreements with the EC, have complained bit- terly about Community barri- ers to their farm output. But these benefits remain in the conditional tense. Next Monday, the 12's agriculture ministers, hostile to the Mac- Sharry philosophy, will meet to pick the plan apart. Their resolve may be stiff- ened by howls of outrage from big farm lobbies. At home in Ireland, Mr MacSharry was described by one farmers' leader as \"the second Crom- well\". In the Netherlands, the plan is vilified as a \"euthana- sia programme\" for farming. But once the farm ministers join real battle on the reform plan, they may find Brussels has them outflanked. To begin with, the plan cre- ates many more winners than losers. At its core - and the Uruguay Round negotiations - is Brussels' intention to con- trol EC cereals output. The main means of control would be to sever the link between the support paid to farmers and the ever-increasing amounts they produce, by giv- ing subsidies on a per hectare basis calculated on past aver- age yield rather than on future tonnage. But only 4 per cent of the EC's 4.3m arable producers will be losers under the plan, by having to \"set aside\" land without compensation. These are the grain barons of the Paris Basin and East Anglia. They have been over-rewarded by the CAP, and should be able to compete if the reform unlocks a Uruguay Round accord which leads to the EC's partners also disarming their farm subsidies. Similarly, the Commission calculates that 86 per cent of the EC's 1.5m dairy farmers, and 80 per cent of its 2.6m beef producers, will fall below the thresholds at which the plan cuts into their output. Without reform, moreover, all farmers will lose. Provi- sional sums by the Commis- sion suggest that agricultural income will fall a further 23 per cent by 1996. With the swingeing price cuts in the planned reform - of 35 per cent on cereals for instance - income loss would be less by 1996, at about 5 per cent. But with compensation on top, incomes would actually increase by some 25 per cent. Under current arrangements, the more the EC spends, the less farmers get. Of a current annual farm budget of about $40bn, some $9bn is wasted on financing surplus food in stor- age. About two-thirds of this is lost permanently through depreciation. But much more is lost through the effect of the overhang on prices: the EC will spend about $15bn this year dumping the surplus (as in a recent beef sale to Brazil at one quarter of EC prices). Reformed spending, by con- trast, would get money to farmers rather than ware- houses, and devote less to incensing the EC's trading partners. And by any serious yardstick, it would cost less. This year's CAP budget is Ecu32.5bn, a rise of 30 per cent on last year. It is set to rise to Ecu34.7bn next 'year. The reform assumes an.Ecu4.8bn risi in 190&96. But immedi- ately thereafter, it would cost less than the present system, - .if spending on east: German farms is included. But by 1907, the new policy should cost Ecu4bn less than projected expenditure. extrapolated from the trend of the last decade. Farm ministers will, in any case, be in no position to argue that the plan costs too much, having tried and failed to raise this year's (unreformed) 'bud- get. Indeed, there is no wnited front against the Commission. Whatever sound and fury farm ministers emit. now, many of their political masteirs are likely to insist that the rewards of a Gatt agreement for EC industry, and the con- solidation of democracy in eastern Europe and .the Soviet Union, are prizes outweighing the costs of CAP reform. Ger- many, the premier industrial power, is likely to take this view. Denmark has indicated it will query the detail rather than the substance of the Mac- Sharry plan, and Mr John Major, the British prime minis- ter, is also understood to be inclining to this position. Mediterranean produce is largely unaffected by the plan, which channels southwards a big chunk of the 80 per cent of the farm budget spent in the rich EC north. France, the EC agricultural superpower, fears for its $10bn surplus on farm trade, the structure of its rural society, and because some 60 MPs in the government's slen- der majority are vulnerable to the farm lobby. But France's CAP fundamentalism was ridi- culed by its partners 10 days ago when Paris blocked \"asso- ciation agreements\" for eastern Europe over 550 tones of beef imports. The alternative plan Mr Louis Mermaz, the French agriculture minister, has been promising since February is now much less likely to con- vince, if he ever produces it. Commission officials expect the Dutch - originally against the plan but now constrained by holding the EC's rotating presidency - to proceed with the reform agenda piecemeal, rather than as an overall pack- age. But this now appears to mesh with Brussels' tactics of introducing the plan, piece by interlocking piece. By the end of October, for example, ministers must decide on a Commission pro- posal - modelled on the cere- als plan - to comply with a Gatt ruling on oilseeds subsi- dies. Despite objections, minis- ters will find it hard to come up with an alternative and, therefore, hard to avoid being locked into the grand design. The farm trade access being offered to eastern Europe, three times as generous as the concessions rejected by mem- ber states before the summer recess and the Soviet events of August, is now likely to go through, over French objec- tions. As France rightly senses, such concessions are part of the slide towards CAP reform. Senior Commission officials seem confident. They are already adjusting their farm subsidies offer within the Uru- guay Round to the CAP plan. At the very least, as one Brus- sels agriculture official puts it: \"The Commission is holding the centre ground ... and that's a comfortable position to be in.\""

Now, there is speculation that it is going for something special: the place in history that awaits whoever smoothly extricates Fidel Castro from Cuba. That role may fall to 68-year-old Manuel Fraga who is still better known for his spell as General Franco's colourful information minister in the 1960s than for his current role as democratically elected president of the autonomous Spanish region of Galicia. Fraga sets off next Monday for a week in Cuba where his father, then just one of thousands of Galician emigrants, met his Basque mother. Fidel's own parents also emigrated from Galida. General Franco was yet another Galician, which helps explain his regime's excellent relations with communist Cuba despite his loathing of the hammer and sickle. Castro himself has never seemed entirely comfortable with Spain's democratic leaders. The Fragas came back to Galicia to start a family. The Castros decided to have theirs on the island.

   "text_content" : "AC\"ome home, America. SThese were the words ' ;Mr George McGoven used to rally oppneitof the Vietnam war, and lobt people might reasonably have esd that the slogap was burled, along with Mr McGovern, In the 1972 presidential caniilgn. Wrong. Today, the McGoi- ern slogan has been revvivd by an odd alliance of conserva- tives, neo-isolationists an anti-communists. Each seeks to redefine America's national interest in a world where the Soviet Union is no longer Pubv lic Enemy Number One. The revival of \"Come Home, America\" - and its counter- part, \"America First\" - shows that the debate over US foreign policy in the post-cold war era is starting to cut across the familiar liberal/conservative lines. So far, President George Bush, the internationalist par excellence, holds sway with his vision of a new world order; but the absence of the \"anti- communist\" glue signals that changes are under way. Leading the charge is Mr Patrick Buchanan, syndicated columnist, television pundit and speech-writer for Presi- dents Reagan and Nixon. Writing in the Washington Post, Mr Buchanan said it was time Americans asked them- selves basic questions: \"What are we getting for $15bn in for- eign aid? Why, 46 years after the second world war, are we defending Germany and Japan while they steal our markets?\" Among Mr Buchanan's reme- dies: an end to the US role in Nato; the withdrawal of all US troops and nuclear weapons in Europe in return for a Soviet pull-out from eastern Europe, the Baltic and the Ukraine; a narrowing of the Monroe Doc- trine - the rationale for Amer- ica's right to intervene in the western hemisphere - to north America; an end to for- eign aid; an end to the mutual security pact with Japan. Mr Buchanan still favours a strong US navy, strategic defence against nuclear attack and supremacy in technology. All these demands can be grouped under the slogan: America First - an evocation of the America First committee formed in the 1920s to make sure that the \"mistake\" of US intervention in the first world war was not repeated. Mr Buchanan would like to re-form an America First com- mittee, but it is debatable whether he can pull in other neo-isolationists or \"neo-real- ists\". Many are worried about the extremes to which he takes his isolationism - captured by his calls for tighter immigra- tion controls and for \"sealing\" the Mexican border. Nor do they have much time for his Japan-bashing, which critics say comes close to protection- ism and underplays the impor- tance of US economic (as opposed to military) engage- ment overseas. Yet many conservatives and fellow Republicans share Mr Patrick Buchanan: Isolationist Buchanan's doubts on whether Mr Bush's pursuit of stability as the central goal of US for- eign policy is enough to cap- ture the hearts and minds of Americans. Mr Ted Carpenter, a foreign policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, argues that Mr Bush's desire for a new world order amounts to preservation of the status quo. How far this is sustainable when the break-up of the Soviet Union and the rise of nationalism pose the threat of instability, is open to question. More seri- ously, upholding the status quo risks plunging the US into regional disputes which do not affect vital American interests, Mr Carpenter adds. Inside the administration, the fashionable talk is still of America as the sole super- power. Mr Bush constantly talks about America toiling to do the \"hard work of freedom\". But to critics such as Mr Car- penter, this all smacks of the failed internationalism of for- mer President Woodrow Wil- son after the first world war. Like Mrs Jeane Kirkpatrick, former US ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Carpenter is a good deal less ambitious: he wants to see the US become a \"nation among nations\", not a hegemonic power. The most serious critique of Mr Bush came from Mr Wil- liam Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs magazine and a leader of the Atlanticist/anti-isolation- ist establishment. In a recent article, Mr Hyland urged Mr Bush to reassess the balance between domestic and overseas commitments and focus more on pressing long-term prob- lems such as the budget deficit and education. \"The enemy is not at the gate, it may already be inside,\" said Mr Hyland. Mr Bush knows he may be vulnerable on these issues - which is why he is stomping around the US and talking about domestic policy. But he remains strong and popular. Mr Buchanan may insist that his brand of neo-isolationism is the wave of the future; but having opposed the war in the Gulf, he found himself sitting alongside his old opponent Mr George McGovern. No wonder he has ruled out running for the White House next year.",

Mr Bush wants the guarantees delayed until aftir,a Middle East peace con- ference planned for next month. But Israelis' worries go deeper than the immediate issue; they fear the American president is engaged in redefin- ing'the very foundations of the US-Israeli relationship. Mr Bush touched several raw nerves last week: he reminded Israelis not just that the US bad in the Gulf war destroyed their most threatening Arab enemy; he added that US sol- diers manning Patriot missile batteries in Israel had defended them with their lives against Iraq's Scud missiles. He pointed out that the US was already spending $4bn in aid to Israel this year - or \"$1,000 for every Israeli man, woman and child\". He suggested the US Jewish lob- by's action in pressing Con- gress to consider the loan guar- antees was against American interests. Israelis, accustomed over the years to no more than gentle presidential reprimands, were stunned. \"Last night we saw an angry, fuming Bush fiercely pounding his fists on the lec- tern in front of him,\" wrote columnist Yoel Marcus in the newspaper Ha'aretz. \"It is hard to remember such an angry public appearance by an Amer- ican president since Eisen- hower presented us with an ultimatum to withdraw from the Sinai in 1956.\" Above all, the government was shocked that for the first time a US president was clearly using economic aid to Israel as a weapon to extract political concessions. At the very least, he had posed a direct challenge to the hardline policies of Mr Yitzhak Shamir and his right-wing govern- ment. \"For us it is a red light,\" acknowledged an official close to the prime minister. Mr Shamir's government has been thumbing its nose at President Bush for months, ignoring repeated signals that administration patience was running out in the belief that support for Israel in Congress would deter a presidential chal- 1980/51 e Source: US Govemmeet PI*Idctlls -\" www,1 dmaflri~~so~sfclWUW*On~lrgG~aw lenge. un me loan guaraunee issue, Mr Shamir brushed aside repeated entreaties from Mr Bush and Mr Baker to delay. Undoubtedly more significant, though, was the way his gov- ernment blithely ignored the US administration's strong views on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. President Bush repeatedly declared that the settlements were an obstacle to the admin- istration's painstaking efforts to arrange a Middle East peace conference. But the govern- ment - mainly through the efforts of Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister - stepped up the pace of settlement build- ing. According to opposition esti- mates, the government spent at least 1.5bn shekels in the West Bank and Gaza last year, chiefly on settlements, a figure likely to double this year. Most provocative, on several occa- sions new settlements were deliberately started on days when Mr Baker made one of his repeated peace missions. In seeking to delay the loan guarantees, Mr Bush wants to force a halt to all Israeli settle- ment building in the occupied Arab territories. Mr Shamir knew his rela- tions with President Bush were cool - much cooler, for exam- e pie, than with the demonstra- tively pro-Israel President Rea- r gan. Mr Shamir was well aware that his insistence that the settlements had no bearing on the peace process cut no ice e with Washington. But he never ; appeared seriously concerned i that President Bush would turn in the direction of eco- ' nomic pressure against Israel. I The implications are poten- tially enormous. US aid has B become a vital prop to Israel's D economy and is at the centre of the government's calculations on how it is to pay for the huge ie nflux of Soviet immigrants p under way for the last 18 months. It is by far the biggest recipi- ent of US foreign aid - and the t world's biggest per capita aid e recipient - followed by Egypt after the Camp David peace a accords were signed in 1979. t The two together account for 40 per cent of US overseas assistance. s Since the early 1980s, all US f aid has been in the form of grants, not loans. At one stage, i it accounted for 18 per cent of Israeli GNP, although the fig- ure has fallen to less than 10 I per cent now. Without it, Israel would not be able to sustain the current high levels of e defence and welfare spending. The extra aid for immigra- tion is requested in the form of loan guarantees, not actual loans. But without the guaran- tees, Israel's ability to borrow in the amounts and at the price it wants would be com- promised. Government minis- ters have said Israelis would rather suffer deprivation to pay for immigration than accept unpalatable US political conditions. But Mr Shamir is reluctant to take the electoral risk of forcing a significant drop in standards of living to pay for the newcomers. How, then, will he react to Mr Bush's challenge? Extreme right-wing ministers in his coalition - including Mr Sha- ron - are urging him to boy- cott the peace process until the guarantees are approved. Viru- lent attacks on Mr Bush have emanated from the govern- ment; one minister came close to accusing him of anti-semi- tism. The opposition, headed by the Labour party, has joined in condemning the administra- tion's linkage of political issues to what most Israelis regard as a simple humanitarian task of absorbing Jews who want to leave the now disintegrating Soviet Union. But it also argues strongly that Mr Sha- nilr is to blame by so antagon- ising President Bush. Labour weapon In the peace process. Mr Bush is indeed playing a nger game. The Middle East peace conference, after all, is only a curtain raiser for direct talks between Israel and her Arab neighbours. It is quite possible that, by next January, when direct talks are under way, the US will suggest a series of \"confidence building\" measures centred around a freeze in Israeli settlements. According to one US official, the US' could make Mr Bush's support for the loan guaran- tees conditional on Israel accepting a settlements freeze in return, say, for some recip- rocal concession such as lifting of the Arab economic boycott against Israel. This in turn is intended to create an in-built dynamic forcing mutual con. cessions from the parties in the interests of a lasting settle- ment. Such a settlement may have eluded successive US presidents, but Mr Bush has made it a deep, personal chal- lenge. The Israeli prime minister is not a man to give ground. He will continue to try to secure extra aid without making big concessions on the peace pro- cess. He has one possible escape route in the form of elections. The popularity of his Likud party is strong and he could engineer an election before the due date of Novem- ber 1992. But today, as he marks the start of Yom Kippur, the Jew- ish Day of Atonement, he knows he faces for the first time an American president prepared to make Israel face the hard political choices it has consistently ducked since it conquered the occupied territo- ries in 1967.

   "text_content" : "Prom Mr R Tuner. Sir, Your report (\"Clumsy attempt at passing the hat\", September 12) on the reaction by institutional investors to the results of and rights issue by BAe brought out, once again, the question of what, when, and how share price-sen- sitive information should be made available by companies. You reflected the prevailing view that there is a privileged group of shareholders called institutional shareholders who have a right to foreknowledge denied to other investors. If the London capital market is not to descend further into the mixture of \"old boys' club\" and \"yuppies' nursery\" it is in danger of becoming, such assumptions must be ques- tioned. It may be perfectly proper to criticise company chairmen for issuing inappro- priate bullish annual reports and doing little between these annual events to keep inves- tors Informed. It is not proper to encourage companies to su- ply information to institutional investors that they are not pr- pared to place n the public domain. The capital market is already bent to favour the institutional investor in ways that wil lead eventually to the demise of the individual share- holder. The spectre of having to pay the institutional pre- mium for the opportunity of investing in British industry is not one I relish. The perfor- mance of institutional inves- tors in the past few years, despite their access to privi- leged information, is not one of which they should be proud. A look at any list of investors in some of the more spectacular financial debAcles of recent years will give some idea of the quality of investment manage- ment currently deemed accept- able. Until we are treated to the luxury of realistic quarterly reports and appraisals of future prospects by companies to all shareholders we are likely to continue to face the 20 per cent fluctuations in share prices such as that of BAe in the first 10 days of September. In the meantime we will pre- sumably continue in the Mickey Mouse world where the financial management of Brt- ish industry is run via whis- In hightass restamrnts between over-privileged invet mrnt gurus.

Yet Ukrainians still comprise a majority in every obkst (politi- cal division) in the Ukraine ecept the Crimea. The Soviet government tried to destroy Ukrainian national identity by the very \"acts of genocide\" and mass expulsion\" which Mr Martimer wishes now to avoid.

   "text_content" : "ill tell you what is wrong. with Mr Nel Kin nock- There is nothing wrong, with Mr Neil Kin- nock. Well, n vt ery much You may dis agree. According to the latest Harris poll in the Observer some l8 per cent of the elec- torate say they do not like him. The equivalent figure for the prime minister is 8 per cent. The Labour leader cannot blame that extraordinary dis- parity entirely on the vicious end of the Tory press. His unalloyed personality is visi- ble on TV. Lately he has looked tight and constrained in his best suit, held in check by his sense of self-discipline. The next moment Mr Major, relaxed in short sleeves and open-neck shirt, smiles the famous smile. The public sees them both. We know the result. Yet viewed as the man- ager of an enterprise, the Labour leader has been a huge success. At best, he has rescued the Labour party from near-extinction. At worst, if my hunch is right, he has postponed an extinction that may be historically inevi- table. Politically bankrupt eight years ago, Labour stands a chance, albeit a slim one, of winning the most seats in the next election. Mr Kinnock's tragedy, and the Labour party's, is that it is more likely to lose, and then start to disintegrate. But you have to blame that on contempo- rary history, not the Labour leader. These are guesses. We must go back to the beginning to appreciate how well Mr Kin- nock has done so far. Labour was very nearly wiped out in June 1983, when its popular vote shrank to 8.5m. The Lib- eral/Social Democratic alli- ance attracted 7.8m votes. Labour's share dropped to 27.6 per cent, lower than in any election since 1918. Mr Mich- ael Foot, then leader of the party, wisely stepped down. On October 2 the previously unheard-of Mr Kinnock replaced him. By 1987 Labour, a shambles under Mr Foot, was in some order. It boasted a smooth campaigning machine. Its pol- icies were not quite so red, wild and woolly as those of 1988, but they continued to include widespread nationalls- ation, unilateral nuclear dis- armament, and a distinctly hostile attitude to the Euro- pean Community. The close ties with the trade unions, not to mention the willingness to meet their every demand, were still in evidence, much as they had been in 1979. The party attracted another 1.5m votes, to make 10m, or just 31 per cent of those cast. It was clearly not good enough. Mr Kinnock did what any competent manager would do. He set out to change the product. Unilater- alism was abandoned. Mem- bership of the EC was enthusiastically embraced. Most thoughts of nationalisa- tion were jettisoned. The lan- guage of the market was, somewhat gingerly, intro- duced. The ties to the trade The Labour party may have became social democratic 20 years too late unions were delicately loos- ened. Extreme left-wing mili- tants were vilified and expelled. The upshot is that what was a socialist party has became a more or less social democratic party. The renewed and repack- aged Kinnock party has been skilfully managed. Its presen- tational expertise, built up by its legendary former director of communications, Mr Peter Mandelson, has become the envy of the other parties. Mr Mandelson has moved on, but his machine has continued to turn over. Until a few weeks ago the result was that Labour could convince itself that it might very well form the next government. It had a long run of poll scores show- ing 40 per cent or more of the electorate willing to vote for it, and it thought it could count on an equally long run of Conservative misfortunes continuing until voting day. Now the polls are turning in the Conservatives' favour. Why? We know the factors working for the Tories - the return of some economic opti- mism, the skilful exploitation by Mr John Major of his role on the world stage - but is that the whole story? Some people are talking about Labour \"peaking too soon\". Others, myself included, rumi- nate about the end of socialist thinking following the disso- lution of the communist empire. We wonder whether the Labour party became social democratic 20 years too late, whether liberalism is now the natural counterpoint to conservatism. There is another, more mundane, view. It is that all the above is commentators' eyewash. This down-to-earth assessment starts with the Momnouth by-election, which the Tories lost on May 16. A Conservative majority of 9,350 in 1987 became a Labour majority of 2,406. The 13 per cent swing against the gov- ernment was enough to put Labour into power with a comfortable majority. At that time the Labour publicity machine was work- ing well. The Conservatives, by comparison, seemed like bumbling amateurs. After Monmouth the Tories took fright, while Labour became complacent. Mr Major appointed four close col- leagues to meet daily to plan campaign strategies and man- age the news. The canny Mr John Wakeham enhanced the team. Labour continued with its constant series of launches and presentations but the steam seemed to have gone out of them. The Tories were thus well placed to make the best of the extraordinary events of August, which thrust their prime minister into the lime- light. Labour seemed unable to cope, particularly while Mr Kinnock was on holiday. There has not been a com- plete reversal. Labour may be less well co-ordinated than it was, but it is neither bumbl- ing nor amateurish. The party is not, however, currently matching the Conservatives' performance. If this view is correct Mr Major should not even think of a November election. For there could be another rever- sal of fortune, this time in Labour's favour. I believe it will be difficult for the party to recapture its former momentum, but it will have a chance to do so at the forth- coming conference in Brighton. Mr Kinnock may be down, but he is not out, not yet.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Marsh. Economics Staff A SHARP FALL In UK retail sales volumes last month, shown by statistics published yesterday, depressed expecta- tions about a consumer-led upturn in the economy, although other figures indi- cated that a recovery in manu- facturing may have begun. According to the Central Sta- tistical Office, seasonally adjusted retail volumes fell in August by a provisional 1.4 per cent compared with July. The drop, which followed two con- secutive monthly increases, was greater than many City analysts had expected. Separately, the CSO said that the decline in manufactur- ing output, which began in April last year, \"appears to have halted\". This assessment, coupled with a big drop in manufactur- ing output costs due to slack- ening wage demands, came after the CSO reported that sac- tory output in the three months to July was up 0.5 per cent compared with the previ- ous three months. This was the first three-month on three- month increase since mid-1990. The two pieces of economic data fit in with theories that the economy is likely to show a small expansion in the third quarter of 1991, indicating a technical end to the recession. However, on the latest eco- nomic evidence, stronger sac- tory output partly fuelled by export demand is likely to emerge as the main engine for growth, rather than increased consumer spending in shops. The figures depressed share prices on the London stock market and the FT-SE 100 index lost 19.8 to 2,606.0. The Retail Consortium, a Small rise In mmnufacturing output ..........................Page 10 Ratnr gloomy ............Page 23 London stocks.............Page 44 trade body for the sector, said it was \"too early\" to talk of a consumer-led recovery and that rising unemployment was damping any slight rise in con- sumer confidence. It also cautioned against reading too much into the August figures, which may have been affected by cut-price sales campaigns being contin- ued by many retailers later into the summer than normal, reducing the chances of a sales uplift sparked by new ranges. On a three-monthly basis, which gives a better idea of underlying trends, June- August sales were 0.2 per cent lower than those in March- May. However, figures for the 10 earlier period were boosted by o3 the rush to buy goods before a VAT increase. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's - trade and industry spokesman, d played down discussion of .a a recovery, saying any upturn d was likely to be \"anaemic and is uncertain\". I- The Treasury, commenting on the figures, said those cov- it ering manufacturing were the e more important. It was espe- y cally heartened by signs of a e continued decline in unit wage i- costs, a factor that is likely to ir help manufacturers. 1, According to the CSO, wage a costs per unit of manufactur- ing output rose by 8.8 per cent i, in the three months to July of compared with a year earlier. In June, the equivalent it increase was 10.8 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By Leyla Boulton in Moscow GOSBANK, the Soviet central bank, will soon be abolished and replaced by a banking council of central bank gover- nors from the republics, the chairman of Russia's central bank said yesterday. Mr Georgy Matiukhin said the council could start in November, or even at the end of next month. \"This council must be created as urgently as possible,\" he said in an inter- view. The plan represents another step towards the dismantling of centralised power struc- tures, a process which has gathered pace since the failure of last month's coup. It would mean that Mr Viktor Gerash- chenko, the Gosbank chairman who is the Soviet Union's best- known banker abroad, would be deprived of his present job. The council would gather the chairmen of the central banks of 12 republics as full members with voting rights, plus the three now indepen- dent Baltic republics which were seeking associate mem- bership, Mr Matiukhin said. He said Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had asked not to have voting rights but had vol- unteered to submit to all the council's decisions. A plan for a similar council was already envisaged in Soviet banking legislation passed in December but prog- ress was held up by political wrangling which preceded the abortive coup. The council would have an executive body responsible for enforcing its decisions, headed by an executive director. Although Mr Gerashchenko was co-operating with the republic central banks on set- ting up the council, Mr Matiu- khin said he did not know whether he would take the new job. Anthony Robinson writes: Mr Gerashchenko declined to comment on his plans yester- day, but was more forthcoming on rescheduling the Soviet for- eign debt, which he described as \"an idea that crossed peo- ples minds but which it would be better to avoid\". He told a meeting of Euro- pean bankers in London organ- ised by the Vienna Council, an east-west business association, that \"it would be better to come to a solution where re- scheduling was not necessary\".

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hargreaves BRITISH GAS cut prices for power station customers yes- terday after a six-month row about the cost of supplies. It did not rule out further conflict with consumers and the regu- lator. The company could clash soon with its power customers as it has set a ceiling of Ibn therms of gas a year for power generation, which is well below demand projections of some 5bn therms. This could lead to a rush to sign up for supplies in the next few days. It is the first time British Gas limited supply to this market. British Gas is talking to 12 companies wishing to secure gas supply for planned new power station projects. It was forced by the regulator. the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), to cut prices for these consumers from between 23p and 22p a therm to between 19.6p and 20.3p a therm after the furore surrounding its 35 per cent price rise in March. The privatisation of the UK electricity industry has led to a rush of independent plans to build power generation plants. British Gas had been approached by 18 companies with power projects requiring what the company described as a \"staggering\" amount of gas before the March price rise. The company said it raised the prices then to damp this high demand and could be forced to do so again. \"It is not beyond the realms of possibil- ity that we find ourselves in a rerun of the situation that occurred March,\" said Mr Ced- ric Brown, senior managing director at British Gas. For the first time, British Gas will impose a limit of 525m therms for each power cus- tomer, which is roughly enough to supply a 2,000MW power station. To determine precedence for power stations in getting gas supply, British Gas will also look at four or five key criteria for assessing a project's viabil- ity. These will include funding, electricity contracts and whether the project partners have found a site. The March price rise raised a threat of legal actions which still hangs over British Gas. Two power consortia - Thames Power and a Mobil. Eastern Electricity joint ven- ture - have issued writs against the utility and these could now be settled by a one- off damages payment. The power row has further soured the relationship between British Gas and Ofgas, since the two have fundamen- tally different views about the industrial gas market. Mr James McKinnon, direc- tor general of Ofgas, said yes- terday that any rationing of gas by British Gas would be \"unacceptable\". However, the price announced yesterday was higher than many power gen- erators had been expecting and could prove uneconomic for some independent projects.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor BRITAIN WILL work for a progressive extension of democracy in Hong Kong over the next few years after the sweeping victory by democrats in the colony's first direct elec- tions, Mr Douglas Hurd, for- eign secretary, said yesterday. It is understood that Britain will seek, at a propitious moment before 1997 when Britain is due to transfer sover- eignty over the colony to China, to renegotiate elements of the Hong Kong constitution relating to direct elections. The government's aim would be to increase the number of directly elected representatives in the Legislative Council (Legco) allowed under the Basic Law for Hong Kong, the constitution negotiated between Beijing, London and the colony. Under the present provisions in the Basic Law, the directly elected seats will be raised to 20 in 1995 and 30 in 2003, only half the total number. The United Democrat party and its liberal allies, led by Mr Martin Lee, won 16 of the available 18 seats. But Mr Lee, now de facto opposition leader in the colony, made it clear he wanted all 60 seats of Legco to be directly elected. The remaining 42 Legco members are either nominated by the colony's governor or elected by professional groups. Mr Lee said he would be meeting Sir David Wilson, the colony's governor, today to dis- cuss his demands. Addressing a conference in London on the future of Hong Kong organised by the stock- broker Smith New Court, Mr Hurd said the British govern- ment had two main aims: it wanted to see steady progress towards a greater degree of direct elections; and it wanted this process to be sustained without interruption after the transfer of sovereignty. He said Mr Lee and his allies fought a lively campaign based on a call for faster democracy. \"I hope that the Chinese gov- ernment, having acquiesced in this step forward into direct democracy, will come to terms with the outcome.\" The election result received a much less enthusiastic wel- come from the Chinese govern- ment's representative at the conference. Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, said Mr Lee's victory did not represent \"the political orientation\" of the territory.

   "article_dc_title" : "Hanson Homes in on Beazer",
   "text_content" : "It would have been a dull old year without Lords Hanson and White, and who can be cer- tain that the excitement is over? Yesterday's agreed offer for Beazer obviously makes a bid for ICI even less likely in the short term. Bear in mind, though, that Hanson is using less than 10 per cent of the borrowing capacity permitted under its articles, and that it successfully devoured two very large mouthfuls (Imperial Group and SCM) as recently as 1986. Beazer shareholders will no doubt be relieved to take the money and run. The price tag of Â£350m looks paltry beside net assets of more than Â£1.2bn at the end of June - but then Mr Brian Beazer has not been the first to discover that book value and the real world are very different places. The mar- ket has clearly not been taking the valuation seriously, the group's earnings have virtually collapsed, and Beazer's heavy financing costs severely inhibit its ability to take a tilt at the upturn as an independent com- pany. The more pertinent question is whether this acquisition will revive Hanson's dull stock market rating. On the plus side, Beazer brings a solid chunk of cyclical earnings, is unlikely to dilute earnings even temporarily, and offers immediate scope to refinance expensive debt. One cannot quite picture Hanson the housebuilder, but in 12 months' time the neatly pack- aged CHB may well be able to fetch a better price than the Â£400m-Â£500m being talked about at the moment. The main risk for Hanson is the future environmental cost of the former Koppers' chemi- cal businesses, which prompted a Â£267m reserve two years ago. Some feared that this problem - which is cost- ing about $30m a year - made Beazer virtually unsaleable. Assessing the net present value of these liabilities, how- ever, is the sort of calculation which has earned Lord Hanson his substantial following. Ratners Ratners' interim figures are more encouraging than a pre- tax loss of Â£17.7m initially sug- gests, if only because they fur- nish evidence that customers are frequenting its shops as regularly as before. UK sales are down, but that is because recession-hit consumers have been buying cheaper items. Tighter financial controls are producing operational efficien- cies, although why these took FT-SE Index: 2,0. (*19.) Beazer. Share rice relative to the FT~A AlSharwe Index 100 Soumr: Dalastmam so long to introduce is still a mystery. Salisburys improved enough to suggest it is no lon- ger a basket case. In the US, progress at Kay was solid. Admittedly, Ratners' fixed costs rather caught up with it in the first half, but group for- tunes have always largely depended on a brief trading period before Christmas. The unusual uncertainty over shop- ping habits this year makes forecasting the full-year perfor- mance a mug's game. The big question is what yes- terday's maintained interim dividend signalled. The shares already yield more than 10 per cent, but the prospect of a divi- dend cut would undermine that case for buying them. Rat- ners needs to make around Â£70m pre-tax to avoid paying a partially uncovered full-year dividend. There are plenty who would not bet on it achieving that. Dalgety The hard part is yet to come for Dalgety. Two years of reor- ganisation have produced a focused, slimmed-down com- pany with a strong balance sheet. The further write-downs against the remaining invest- ment in Dalgety Farmers mean there should be no further shocks from there, even though the situation in Austra- lia appears to be going from bad to worse. In its present form, the company should be able to turn out solid, if unin- spiring, earnings growth over the next few years. But the 18 per cent gearing ratio leaves plenty of room for expansion via acquisition, pre- sumably elsewhere in Europe where the group is under-rep- resented. Dalgety would be lucky indeed to find anything in the snacks sector at an affordable multiple. There may be more scope in pet food or ingredients, though here again it will have to be selective to ensure that any eventual pur- chase actually enhances earn- ings potential. At 423p, the shares are trad- ing on an undemanding his- toric multiple of less than 12. It is hard to see a significant re- rating until an acquisition is on the table. UK economy Yesterday's retail sales and manufacturing output figures once again contain an uncer- tain message. After two strong months, retail sales in August fell by more than expected, but not so far that talk of a gentle upward trend must be dis- counted - consumers might feel less bad, but do not yet feel good. On the face of it, any disappointment on that score should have been more than counteracted by the 0.8 per cent jump in July manufactur- ing output. All sectors enjoyed output above their recession- ary lows. But tighter control of stocks and wages means pro- ductivity should be running ahead, benefiting company profits and core inflation. Instead the figure fell in July by as much as output rose. It looks more than ever like a sluggish recovery. Morgan Crucible On the surface, a 7 per cent increase to Â£28.5m in first half pre-tax profits suggests Mor- gan Crucible has weathered the recession rather well. There is no sign of the account- ing devices which detracted from the presentation of its full-year results in April, although operating profits include some Â£7.3m from acqui- sitions this year and last, and the company gives no clue as to how far the first-half figures have been struck after drawing on provisions. So investors cannot be sure whether the underlying picture is quite as good as that suggested by an 11.5 per cent overall operating margin. The company says it has now overcome its addiction to rights issues. The proceeds of April's call are still largely unspent, though a medium- sized US purchase for the tech- nical ceramics division appears reasonably imminent. But Morgan Crucible still has something of a credibility problem with its strategy of cornering niche market share by acquisition. That probably explains why the shares are only on a historic multiple of 11, even after their recent rise. IL",

   "text_content" : "By Paul Betla, Aerospace Correspondent BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday announced a top management reshuffle following the resigna- tion of Mr Liam Strong, the air- line's director of marketing and operations who will take over later this week as chief executive of a large business in the UK retailing sector. Mr Strong said he was leaving BA to become chief executive of a company with sales of Â£2bn a year. Although he declined to dis- close the name of the company, it is understood to be a retailer. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's com- pany secretary and legal director, is taking over Mr Strong's job. Both Mr Strong, aged 46, and Mr Ayling, aged 44 - as leading members of BA's top manage- ment team - have been regarded as candidates for chief executive of the airline. Mr Strong joined BA in 1988 from Reckitt & Colman, first as director of marketing and then as head of marketing and airline operations when the two func- tions were merged. The job involves responsibility for day-to-day operations of the air- line and marketing, a workforce of 29,000 people, an expenditure budget of Â£3bn a year and annual sales of more than Â£4bn. \"But the opportunity to become chief executive of a com- pany is very hard to turn down,\" Mr Strong said. Apart from Mr Ayling's appointment, the departure of Mr Strong has led to the reshuffle of other senior positions. Mr John Watson is taking charge of human resources in addition to his existing job of information management; Mr Mervyn Walker is returning from the Galileo computer reservation system group to take over as legal director; Ms Gail Redwood steps up from deputy company secretary to company secretary. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's dep- uty chairman and chief execu- tive, said the internal manage- ment reshuffle had enabled the company to avoid any radical restructuring and disruption of its management. Lord King, BA's chairman, said the most significant appointment was Mr Ayling's move to the marketing and operations job. Mr Ayling was a government official specialising in aviation and trade affairs before joining BA in 1985 initially as legal direc- tor in the company's run-up to privatisation. He has been closely involved in BA's international and domestic negotiations on civil aviation issues. * The BA management reshuffle coincided with reports from Brus- sels yesterday that Sabena's negotiations to find a strategic partner for the Belgian national airline had progressed further with Air France than with BA. Sabena appears to have advanced in its collaboration talks with the French carrier. Talks with BA were still continu- ing but with little progress. The loss-making Belgian airline is seeking a partnership with another international carrier as part of its recovery strategy.",

   "text_content" : "n the mid-1980s, Mr Charles Pullin, chief executive of Koppers, the US building materials group, bet his company on an upsurge in spending to replace America's crumbling roads, bridges and public works. He lost: in June 1988 his company was bought for $1.7bn (Â£988m) by Beazer, of the UK. In turn, Mr Brian Beazer thought the fortunes of his merged group would be secured by US infrastructure spending. He was wrong. His Â£1.2bn of debt, much of it taken on to buy Kop- pers, forced him to plan to dis- member his business, then abruptly reverse course yester- day and sell it to Hanson in a Â£351.4m recommended offer. But a good story never dies. Now, Mr Martin Taylor, Hanson's vice-chairman, listing the virtues of the deal, gives pride of place to a forecast upturn in American infrastructure investment. Less than two years ago, close to the height of the market, Han- son sold four ARC building mate- rials companies in the US for $650m. (Â£384m) Now, as the Bea- zer purchase brings it ownership of America's second largest aggregates company, there is a raft of public policy pronounce- ments that suggest federal and state infrastructure spending might start rising again. Hanson's timing of its move back into building materials will prove justified if US federal, state, and local governments are able to squeeze a few more dol- lars out of their dwindling trea- suries for their public works. That is a big if. But the timing of Hanson's move to take over Beazer, at any rate, cannot be faulted. Only last Tuesday, Bea- zer was still anticipating reduc- ing its debt through a flotation of CHB, the UK house building com- pany which was the mainstay of the group's rapid growth in the 1980s. Beazer's realisation that dras- tic action would be required to solve its problems dates back to March. Mr Beazer and his then deputy chief executive Mr John Matthews, who had joined Beazer from County NatWest, the com- pany's adviser, agreed that all was not well. In particular, share- holders did not understand the Anglo-American approach of the company. They were left asking whether Beazer should best be seen as a US- or UK-based com- pany. The obvious answer was to divide the company into two. But Mr Beazer feared the drawbacks of that approach outweighed the advantages. By putting a price on the separate businesses Beazer would become more vulnerable to a bid. At about the same time, Lord Hanson first mentioned to an adviser that he was interested in Beazer. But he only asked NM Rothschild, his merchant bank, to look seriously at the deal in June, after Beazer's banks forced Mr Beazer to reduce his borrow- ings by floating off CHB. The CHB flotation, now shelved, would have raised about Â£450m. That would have solved Beazer's immediate need for cash. The latest of a series of reschedulings with banks, announced last week when Bea- zer announced a 43 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Â£60.6m last year, required Beazer to repay $600m. But had the CHB sale gone ahead, Mr Beazer would have been left with with no role in the UK and a rough ride in the US. The banks would still have been owed about Â£600m; and the com- pany would also have been left with interest cover and debt repayment conditions that would have become increasingly demanding after this year. As one adviser to Hanson said yesterday, \"The chance of work- ing for Hanson appealed more to Mr Beazer than continuing to do battle with the banks.\" Mr Beazer would also have been left with considerable envi- ronmental liabilities which Bea- zer inherited with its Koppers investment, and which Hanson will presumably in turn acquire. These relate to the clean-up costs of about 70 chemical dump sites and a similar number of plant sites in businesses which now been sold. Beazer had to indemnify the buyer of these businesses for the clean-up costs before the sale' could go ahead. Only two or three plants have reached the clean-up stage and Beazer is in negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency. Its in-house counsel said earlier this year that things were proceeding at \"glacial speed\". Beazer has provided Â£267m against the cost of these clean-up operations and was expecting annual costs of about $35m. While the company has always claimed the provisions are suffi- cient, some investors, especially in the UK, have worried the final liability might be higher. The stock market in London did not question that Lord Han- son's ready money was a better bet than Beazer's uncertain future: Beazer shares rose 39 per cent on the news of the deal, to close at 115/%p. At their high point, in 1987, they touched 273p. Hanson's move yesterday ended an extraordinary decade at Beazer. From a small West of England builders at the start of the 1960s, with a market capital- isation of under Â£10m, it grew through relentless acquisition to become an International building materials group valued at nearly Â£800m before the October 1987 stock market crash. The crash did not stop Mr Bea- zer pressing on with the acquisi- tion of Koppers, a bid too far. His father, said Mr Beazer once, had told him \"to do a little more each day than I did yesterday\".

   "text_content" : "By Guy de Jonqulbres, Consumer Industries Editor PRE-TAX profits at Dalgety, the restructured UK foods company, fell from Â£11l.1m to Â£110.9m in the year to June 380 because of disposals and lower property profits. However, trading profits from continuing operations rose to Â£114.6m from 297.4m, on turn- over of Â£3.771m against Â£4.68bn last time, though tax and extraordinary items of Â£88.9m relating to disposals reduced attributable profits to Â£48.8m, against 6&A8m last time. Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive, said all the continuing core businesses except flour mill- ing had weathered the recession strongly and the quality of prof- its had improved. Corporate reorganisation and asset dispos als were largely completed. \"We are now in a position where we can afford to back our good busi nesses,\" he said. Increased advertising had helped the company's pet food, crisps and flour businesses increase their share of the UE market, while pet food, snacks and cake mix plants had bene flted from investment. Asset sales reduced net gear ing to 18 per cent from 37 pe cent, while the ratio of net inter est cover rose to 13.7 from 5.8. Dalgety has regrouped its bust nesses into four. All improved trading profits except food ingre dients, where a deterioration is the flour business reduced trad ing profit to Â£25.8m from Â£27.2n on turnover of Â£323m, up fron Â£297m. Helped by acquisitions, trad ing profit of consumer foodi grew 28 per cent to Â£49.7m or sales of Â£568m, up from Â£505m Pet food sales increased in spite of a decline in the UK market while exports to continental Europe grew substantially. Trading profits on food distri bution - principally the US sub sidlary Martin-Brower - rose 2. per cent to Â£12.4m on turnover ol Â£1J88bn, down from Â£2.1bn. The agribusiness groul increased trading profits by 2! per cent to Â£26.7m on sales oa Â£919m, up from Â£878m. Extraordinary items includei a Â£9.7m write-down on the investment in Dalgety Farms, i Â£9.8m loss on the disposal of Dal gety Produce, Â£9.3m on other dis posals and a provision on unsoli assets of commodity traders Gil and Duffus.

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd ACQUISITIONS helped Morgan Crudcible, the industrial materi- als manufacturer, report a 7 per cent increase in taxable profits for the six months to end-June. While operating profit remained static at Â£35m, pre- tax profit rose from 226.6m to 528.5m. Turnover was 2310m (Â£284m). Mr Bruce Farmer, chief exec- utive, said more acquisitions would follow. Morgan is cur- rently conducting due dili- gence audits in five companies, worth about Â£85m, which it is interested in buying. Helped by cost reductions margins have remained static. A rationalisation programme resulted in the loss of 1,000 jobs last year and another 500 in the period under review to bring the total workforce down to m.000. Further job losses are ea ted and Morgan has earinared r3n as an extraordnrytem to cover redundancies in a ac- tory which is soon to be closed. Mr Farmer said the item wa being taken above the line because it would not recur. Mr Farmer, while pessimistic about any possible UK upturn said he remained confident about Morgan's future. Capital expenditure for the year-end is expected to have increased from Â£22m to Â£86m a year. The interim dividend Is raised from 5.49p to 5.75p. Jully diluted earnings per share fell from 11.7p to 10.2p. Most of Morgan's business is now based abroad, with 37 per cent in North America and 24 per cent in continental Europe. Mr Farmer said there were already signs of improvement in the North American market. \"We believe the US will be the firt out of the recession,\" he added. The Carbon division increased it sales to Â£57.3m (t56.1m) and maintained its at M im in amwhich affctd ndal and automotive markets. Thermal Ceramics boosted its profits to l11.7m (lO.m) on the back of acquisitions. The newly-formed Specialty Materi- ale and Tchnologies Division Increased its profits to 9.4n (8.6m). The only division to report a fall was Technical Ceramics, which turned in operating prof- its of Â£5.1m against MÂ£8.m pre- viously.

   "text_content" : "N A last-ditch effort to avert a qualification from auditors, Richmond Oil and Gas, the London-listed US natural resources group, has had to delay posting its annual accounts to shareholders. However, Mr David Wilkin- son, joint managing director, said he expected the accounts to be sent in the next few days - without a qualification - once a deal which could raise between $15m (Â£8.8m) and $20m has been completed. For Richmond, which devel- ops low-risk oil and gas reserves, faces a severe liquid- ity problem. Cost over-runs, disappoint- ing assets and falling gas prices have taken a heavy toll on the group, which announced annual losses of Â£795,000 on turnover of Â£7.5m last month. Yesterday's news was greeted with little surprise in the City. The share price has plunged from 173p in June last year to just 17p last night, reflecting a widespread and longstanding disillusionment with the group. Richmond's immediate prob- lems will only be solved by the sale of a 75 per cent stake in its coalbed methane field in the San Juan Basin in Colorado. Mr Wilkinson said the group expected to sign a deal today. Since Richmond was floated in July 1989, it has spent some $14m developing the San Juan property. Once the sale is completed, Mr Robert Fox, the group's rel- atively new non-executive chairman, maintains Rich- mond will return to profits. His ace, he says is the Richmond Ranch, a sprawling 100,000-acre property in west Texas, of which Richmond Oil claims 50,000 acres. Mr Wilkinson says Rich- mond is in the unique position of owning complete operational control: it does not have to pay royalties on output, nor does it have to meet drilling require- ments. \"We can set the pace of our own programme.\" Proven developed reserves of oil on the ranch are 4.5m bar- rels, while proven gas reserves stand at 40bn cubic feet. The group also claims a further 6.5m barrels of proven but undeveloped oil reserves, and 210bcf proven but undeveloped gas lies under the ranch. But Richmond urgently needs cash to develop the field's potential. And there lies the rub. Buying Richmond Ranch, which many analysts say was overpriced at $80m, depleted already stretched reserves. Richmond Oil's liquidity problems are not new. Ever since its debut on the London stock market, it has been beset with troubles. Of the four main properties with which it was floated, two have proved unworkable. The Panhandle properties in Texas, which were by far the most highly valued in the pro- spectus at $30m proven and $50m probable reserves, are now virtually closed down. Richmond has also relin- quished its license on the Hayes field in Louisiana, with- out even drilling a well. That leaves San Juan, soon to be sold, and Richmond Ranch, which cannot be further devel- oped until the deal is completed. However, Richmond has won some praise for its Jicarilla joint venture with the Apache nation to explore 26,000 acres of tribal land. The company has farmed out exploration to American Hunter, a subsidiary of the Canadian Noranda group, and agreed a percentage of production profits in return. Yet Jicarilla's contribution to cash flow is some way away, say analysts. It will take a lot to repair the company's City reputation. Problems have included the virtually ignored flotation in 1989 in which 85 per cent of shares were not taken up, and a disputed 231m cash call in October last year, after which underwriters County NatWest found itself holding 5.5m shares. Mr Fox, who came to the group at the invitation of County NatWest after the rights issue, admits that Rich- mond has to work on its image. \"The credibility of our man- agement has fallen to a very low level in London,\" he said.",

He said that, when merged, the two businesses would com- pete better with rapidly Increasing imports from large European canners as the Euro- pean industry consolidated. Both companies specialise in peas, carrots, potatoes and baked beans, and in room-tem- perature ready meals. Hillsdown's canning busi- ness has had a tough year. Baked bean wars, destock- ing and rationalisation costs in 1990 cut canning profits by about Â£5m to Â£15m, analysts estimate. ABF will receive 8.23m Hillsdown ordinary shares but will be restricted from selling them freely for two years. Hillsdown also announced that it had acquired El Toro, the Dutch meat snack manu- facturer, for an undisclosed amount. El Toro would be merged with Hillsdown's exist- ing Dutch meat snacks busi- ness. Hillsdown made pre-tax profits in 1990 of Â£191m on turnover of Â£4.2bn.

When Mr Warren took over, Dalgety was a loose assortfment of food and agribusiness activi- ties, with geographically scat- tered operations and an increasingly patchy earnings record. Its image in the City was poor, having been severely damaged by what many ana- lysts regarded as the ill-judged acquisition of Gill & Duffus, a commodity trader, in 1985. Mr Warren has instituted a far-reaching shake-up intended to rid Dalgety of poorly per- forming activities, improve efficiency and refocus the com- pany on a narrower range of businesses, with emphasis on the UK and continental Europe. The changes included: * The disposal of Gill & Duf- sus; of most of Dalgety Farm- ers, an Australian sheep busi- ness which is now heavily in loss; and of about a dozen other, smaller companies. * The extensive reorganisa- tion of the company from a geographic to a product basis and the removal of a tier of middle management. Dalgety's US headquarters has been closed and staff at its London head-office halved to about eair promotion of the 0mpiy's bigger consumer minds, such as Winalot and Kflttoine\"t pet foods, Golden WoJder cisps and pot noodles, Spillers flour and Homepride baking products. Advertising spending has trebled to about \"z3m in the past three years. -Though the disposals were reflected in a fall in the com- pany's pre-tax profits in the year to June, profit before exceptional items and earnings per share both rose slightly. Meanwhile, net gearing improved dramatically during the year from 37 to 18 per cent. H aving shown his skills as a cutter, Mr Warren will be judged in his third year of office by his suc- cess as a builder. \"We're now at the stage where underlying growth becomes the priority,\" says Mr Alan Erskine, food industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, who believes the stock market has not yet appreciated the full extent of ialgety's turnround. Dalgety is sometimes faulted for lacking world leadership in any large foods market - a charge it vigorously contests. \"Clearly, we haven't got a Mars Bar,\" says Mr Warren, but quickly points out that it is first or second in the UK mar- kets for pet foods, crisps, pot foods and home cooking mixes. \"Being number two doesn't mean you can't make good money,\" says Mr .J6hn>MtrtÂ»isi, Dalgety's fin.ance aftstdr-; \"But you obviously make more money out of being 0ui r one.\" Still, for a company with European ambitions.'

However, he is cautious about the prospects. \"There is a lot of talking going on in Europe at the moment, but finding the right business that is prepared to sell is very diffi- cult,\" he says. M eanwhile, it would hardly be surprising if Dalgety's improv- ing fortunes earned it a place among the British food compa- nies repeatedly canvassed by the City as potential targets for a large predator hungry for a bigger slice of the European foods business.",

The Torday board said in a statement that the offer was unwelcome and should be rejected. Reasons would be given but meanwhile holders should take no action. In the stock market Torday shares jumped by 26p to 90p, while Dowding lost Ip at 60p. Dowding sales grew 5.6 per cent to Â£79.6m (Â£75.4m) but Mr Peter Hollins, chairman, said that the recession had not been just confined to the UK but had also been felt elsewhere, most notably on the continent of Europe. Both the Nether- lands and Luxembourg turned in reduced sales and profits, while Germany had to absorb Stein and Vendel, a rewind company, the assets of which were bought last November. Profits were also reduced by Â£400,000 due to one-off costs related to redundancies. Mr Hollins said that the board was continuing its policy of steadily increasing dividend payments and proposed a final of 1.52p to make a total of 2.4p, an increase of 11.1 per cent. Earnings per share amounted to 4.09p (5.96p), after tax of Â£2.92m (Â£4.11m). On the future, the chairman said that the company was sen- sitive to changes in the various sectors of the economy. From its own indicators, it would appear that the recession started in October 1990 and bottomed out at the end of June.",

The trading results of MD, the US specialist drug company, acquired in May, were included from April 1.

The strong rise in first-half turnover includes a contribu- tion from Thomas Kerfoot, which was acquired in July last year, sales of products acquired from SmithKline Bee- cham in late 1990 and five months sales of Wellcome's vaccine business, which it acquired this January.

The agreement with Toyota ties Inchcape to a bandwagon that should really start rolling in Europe in 1993, although by 1998 its share of Toyota GB will be reduced to 49 per cent. Turning to the businesses in its long-term control, the test will be to both build them up and prove that they can make combined progress, rather than simply proving a comforting swings-and-roundabouts pro- file. A all-year forecast of just over Â£180m pre-tax (Â£174m) gives a prospective p/e of nearly 15. With recovery pros- pects for UK motor trading thrown in, the stock is worth holding.",

BRITISH GAS plc, CONTRACT GAS PRICING SCHEDUIE LONG TERM INIRRRUPmIBLE GAS REF: LT3 Effective: 17tb September 1991 (1) Introduction This Schedule LTI3 supersedes Schedule LTI2 In respect of all Long Term Interruptible Gas contracts entered into from 17th September 1991. Under Section 14(4) of the Gas Act 1986 British Gas may enter into special agreements (contracts) with Customers for the supply of gas through pipes to premises which they own or occupy on the prices and terms shown in this Schedule subject to the conditions of a standard contract entitled 'Special Agreement for the Supply of Gas: Long Term Interruptible Gas\" British Gas reserves its position as to whether to enter into contracts where it considers that to do so is not consistent with its overall duties under Section 9(1) of the Gas Act 1986. The prices and terms shown do not apply to back-up gas or to the other forms of supply identified in Condition 5 of British Gas' Authorisation. Copies of this Schedule and conditions of contract are available from the Rcgistered Office or Regional Head Offices of British Gas pkc. (1) Standard Terms of a Iong eIrm Interruptible Gas Contract: Gas will be supplied under a standard c t, ot n the basis that dthe supply is taken for not less than 10 and not more than 15 Contract Years to a Customer wishing to consume gas at premiscs in its ownership or occupation at which its Nominated Consumption of gas must be in excess of 50 million therms per Contract Year at the premises. Each Customer (induding its afiliate companies; see note 10) is limited to a maximum of 525 million therms Nominated Consumption in aggregate under this Schedule and any previous Long Term Interruptible schedules, which is equivalent to a maximum actual consumption of 666 million therms. The eariest start date is 1 July 1995 and the latest start date is 30June 1996 (see note 3). Under the standard contract terms the supply of gas wil be interruptble for a minimum period of 7 days (see note 8) and a maximum period of 45 days in each Contract Year. The periods of interruption, which wil occur at British Gas' discretion, may or may not be continuous. The Basic Scheduled Reference Price for all quantities of gas consumed under a Long Term Internruptible Gas contract will vary in accordance with the specific type of escalation terms chosen by the Customer. These choices are set out in Table 1. TABLE 4 PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR EACH INCREMENTAL TRANCHE OF GAS CONSUMED IN A LONG TERM INTERRUPTIBLE CONTRACT THERMS CONSUMED IN PERCENTAGE REDUCTION FOR EACH TRANCHE A CONTRACT YEAR TRANCHE OF GAS CONSUMED 1 1 to 125,000,000 Nil 2 125,000,001 to 200,000,000 0.25 3 200,000,001 to 300,000,000 0.50 4 300,000,001 to 400,000,000 0.75 5 400,000,001 and thereafter 1.00 (v) Notes 1. Conditions of Contract The notes given in this Schedule summarise elements of the standard conditions of a Long Term Interruptible Gas contract and the way in which they will be applied. They are not exhaustive and cannot take precedence over, or modify, any of the terms or conditions of the standard contract entered into by any individual Customer. 2. Annual Nominated Quantity of Gas An annual nominated quantity of gas may be fixed for each Contract Year by the Customer within the range of plus or minus 15% of the Nominated Consumption, except that in the first Contract Year the range will be plus 15%/minus 30% of the Nominated Consumption. The Customer shall take at least, or make a minimum payment for gas equivalent to, 70% of this annual nominated quantity. If the supply has been interrupted at the direction of British Gas, then an allowance will be given for the days interrupted in ascertaining the annual consumption for the purpose of minimum payment calculations. 3. Start Date The Start Date is the date from which the Contract Years will run and the minimum payment obligations will apply, although British Gas and the Customer may agree that gas for commissioning may be taken prior to the Start Date. 4. Customer's Financial Status Potential Customers will be required to evidence, prior to or within 6 months of signing the contract, to the reasonable satisfaction of British Gas that they have the financial capability to meet their contractual payment, indemnity and other obligations so as to sustain a Long Term Interruptible Gas contract. Evidence of satisfactory progress on associated planning, engineering and commercial agreements will be required before initial signing. 5. Pressure The pressures at which British Gas supplies gas vary at different parts of the gas supply system. British Gas will supply gas to a Customer at a pressure above the statutory minimum level if this is available at the point of supply. For pressures up to 35 bar British Gas will use reasonable endeavours to maintain any such elevated pressure. If British Gas expects the supply pressure to reduce to a lower level permanently then not less than 36 months' written notice will be given. 6. Price of Gas Under the contract the mechanism for determining the price of gas, in accordance with the specific escalation terms selected by the customer, shall be set out in a price indexation formula utilising indices which give effect to these escalation termns. Prices are Quarter 1 1990 prices. 7. Revisions of Trms The prices and other terms shown in this Schedule may be modified a the discrtion of British Gas. These prices and other terms will not be altered within 28 days of any previous araion without the consent of the Director General of Gas Supply (Ogas). Customer shodd note that alesatios to the prices and other terms may be put into effect immediately upon notification by British Gas. However, such alterations will not have eFect on Customers who have entered into a contrac uander this Schedule prior to such modification. 8. Interruption The agga period of inteuption over the 10 to 15 Contract Years wl be not more duthan 300 dys. Without prejudice to the rights of British Gas to interrupt supplies of gas provided in accordance with this Schedule, the requirem t for a minimum period of interruption sha deemed to have be suspended unless and unmt at least three months have expired from the giving by British Gas of notice under the contract with the Customer of its Intention to implement such minimum period of 9.

   "text_content" : "By Mi-hel U lkpinher AMSTRAD and GEC Marconi are developing a video tels- phone which they intend to sll as a mass consumer prod, nct to be available from retai :ea by the third quarter of neat year. Amstrad said the telephor would be within the price range of its other consumer electronics products, which suggests that it will ell for lm than 500. It will have a slipup colour screen measuring tree inches by four inches with an inbuilt ideo camera allowing callers to see one another. GEC Marconi will concen- trate on the development of the phone's electronic data com- pression system, while Amst- rad will be responsible for the design of the unit. BT estimates that the Euro- mean video phone market will be worth Â£1.7bn annually by199e6. BT is a participant in the European Videophone Experi- ment (Eve-2), along with France Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost, Norway Telecom, PTT Nederland and SIP Italy. Amstrad and GEC Marconi have collaborated previously in the manufacture of television satellite dishes. Satellite equip- ment was the only area of Amstrad's business to show any growth last year and the company has been looking for additional consumer products to add to its range. Although Amstrad has launched several new computers, it has found it diffcult to recover from defects in products it sold in the late 1980s. 0 Amstrad said yesterday that it is suing Seagate Technology of the US for over $150m (Â£87m) for allegedly supplying it with faulty disc drives which it used in its computers. Amistra Is exnected to launch a se d suit shortly against anther unnamed US company. Amstrad recalled 7000 of its computers in 198B after discov- enfaults in their disc drives. Earer this year it said It would make an exceptional write-down against unsold computers of Â£20m, a sum equivalent to nearly half the previous year's pre-tax profits. The company said it had begun proceedins against Sea- gate n California, where the US company has its headquar- ters. Amstrad said it was claiming compensation for financial loss and damage to its reputation. The Seagate disc drives were used in Amst- rad's PC2386 computer. Seagate said: \"We feel the suit is without merit and it will be vigorously defended.\""

The appointment of a conservator constitutes an Event of Default under the Indenture permitting the exercise of certain remedies thereunder according to the terms of the Indenture. However, we have been advised that Section 11 (e)(12)(A) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\"FIRREA\"), provides: \"(A) IN GENERAL-The conservator or receiver may enforce any contract.. .notwithstanding any provisions of the contract providing for termination, default, acceleration, or exercise of rights upon, or solely by reason of, insolvency or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. We understand that RTC believes that this section of the law would overrule the provisions of the Indenture and would prevent any exercise of remedies if the only Event of Default were the appointment of a conservator. In addition, Section 5.02 of the Indenture may be applicable, which Section provides in substance that if the only Event of Default is the appointment of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (or any successor thereto) ('FSLIC\") as receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) in respect of the Company, no acceleration of the maturity of the Notes shall occur unless the Trustee shall have been notified in writing that FSLIC does not object to such acceleration of maturity. We are not aware of any other Event of Default under the Indenture. The collateral held by us presently meets the coverage requirements of the Indenture and such collateral appears to comply with the terms of the Indenture.

   "text_content" : "Byl WMoip n akamt RUGBY GROUP, the building materials company which sup plies about one fifth of the UK's cement marketsuffered a 21 per cent decline in prflts in the six months to June 30. Pre- tax profits fell from u8.m to 327.4m in the face of the severe downturn in world construce tion markets. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.85p and the shares responded positively to the news, rising 4 to OOp. The group continued to be cautious about the second half stating that the much talked- about upturn in the UK had not yet materialised, although \"there are faint signs that t worst may be over\". Mr Peter Carr, mnaging director, said that lower Interest rates had not come in time to have a benefiial effect on the second- half performance. Rugby's main markets in the UK, US and Australia were all depressed in the first half by the effects of recession. In the UK, where its cement business provides 40 per cent of overall trading profit, the group suffered a 29 per cent decllne in profits to Â£10.3m was particularly vul- ablto the current reces- so au It Is reglonally blased towards the south-east, which has been the worst affected Joinery was down to Â£l5lm (E9.5m), while the steel divi- on, which last year saw the end of a contract to supply reinforced steel to the Channel tunnel, fell to Â£1.03m (Â£l.56m). In the US, the joInery compa- nies \"deteriorated further\", Rugby said. The US market was severely hit by the effects of the Gulf war with a Â£578,000 first-half loss (Â£85,000 profit) concentrated in the first four months of the year. Declines in operating profits from the European joinery and steel businesses were partially offset by a 41 per cent rise in the glass division to Â£805,000 (Â£570,000). The group was able to realise the benefits of heavy investment in its French glass transformation operations. - CONMENT The 21 per cent profits decline, following the 25 per cent fall at the year-end, failed to rub tbh shine off Rugby. The group has won acclaim in the City for its quickponse to the deterior- stig tading environment and its strong balance sheet, show. ing net cash of f5A5m. Even Rugby's 19 per cent fall in cement profits compares favourably with Blue Circe's 45 per cent drop. The interim results were on the better end of forecasts, lifting the shares and reassuring investors of the group's solid qualities. The market has pretty much dis- counted any recovery until at least 1992 and the 200p barrier looks a tough one to breach in the long term. However, the combination of its exposure to the housing market and the group's strong asset base (with shareholders funds conserva- tively estimated at about 90p per share and good cash flow approaching 20p per share) make Rugby one of the more attractive stocks in the indus- try. Full-year profits are fore- cast at Â£55m and give earnings per share of 13.1p, which looks undemanding, relative to its sector.",

   "text_content" : "By Alice Raowhomn LOPEX, the marketing services group which has restructured its interests after a senior man- agement row, is passing its interim dividend following a fall from pre-tax profits of Â£3.41m to a loss of Â£916,000 in the first half. Mr Peter Thomas, who was appointed as chief executive a year ago after the surprise departure of Mr John Castle, said the group had been trad- ing profitably since May and hoped to make a profit for the full year. The shares were static at 50p on yesterday's announcement. Lopex, like other marketing services companies, has been affected both by the recession and by the impact of the Gulf war on business confidence during the first six months of the year. Mr Thomas said its performance improved in the second quarter but not enough to eradicate the losses in the \"awful first quarter\". Turnover in the six months to June 30 fell from Â£119m to Â£lllm and operating profits from Â£698,000 to Â£80,000. The group paid Â£948,000 (Â£924,000) in interest. It produced losses per share of 4.1p (earnings of 7.87p). In addition to the pressures of war and recession, Lopex also incurred costs associated with its recent restructuring when it rationalised its inter- ests and sold a number of sub- sidiaries. It has been left with surplus properties at a cost of about Â£lm a year. Mr Thomas said that \"realistically\" it could not expect to dispose of these prop- erties until 1993. It also incurred redundancy costs of Â£500,000 in the first half. The closure of its Newcastle opera- tion and costs associated with the departure of Mr Ray Fine, former chairman of the direct marketing company RCF, each cost Â£200,000. Mr Thomas said the restruct- uring was largely completed. However, it was still in the throes of selling or merging a number of \"minor loss mak- ers\" in the UK and overseas. He expected to complete this by the end of the year. Lopex reduced its net debt from Â£13.9m to Â£7.6m at the end of the interim period by selling Overad and MEAL, two subsidiaries. It had rejected approaches for other busi- nesses, said Mr Thomas, as it was not prepared to sell at \"fire sale prices\". The group continued to trade profitably, he said, although the market was still \"very diffi cult\", particularly for recruit- ment advertising.",

Trading transactions had off- set the limited occupier demand in the commercial sec- tor, and the depressed housing sector, said Mr Manny David- son, chairman. Turnover was Â£21.7m (1l5.2m) of which trading sales accounted for Â£14.7m (Â£7.84m). Investment sales of Â£2.95m pro- duced a surplus of Â£460,000 over cost and Â£100,000 over val- uation. Gross rental income improved to Â£6.49m (Â£5.87m) and Mr Davidson said that the overall level of voids had not increased over the six months. Sales of vacant residential properties slowed but profits were higher in the division as a result of sales to tenants and the disposal of a tenanted estate to a housing association. Overheads were down at Â£lm (Â£1.4m). Interest charges were Â£6.74m (Â£6.68m). Earnings per share came out at 3.4p (1.lp) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.65p (0.6p).",

   "text_content" : "By Joan Gray DESPITE RECORD exports of Â£10.4m, Fii Group, the footwear and scientific equipment man- ufacturer, suffered a downturn in pretax profits from Â£875m to Â£7.15m for the year ended May 31, well below the Â£8.5m brokers' forecast. The figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Â£70,000 to cover the full costs of redundancies in the foot- wear division. Turnover was ahead at Â£SO.3m for the 52 weeks against Â£74.4m for the previous 53 weeks. Exports contributed 13 per cent against last time's 10.9 per cent. Footwear continued to be the company's biggest earner, making Â£69.5m turnover and Â£6.22m exports. Within the division, the Lotus brand improved home sales by 14 per cent and exports by 26 per cent. Fiona Footwear more than trebled its exports to A.8m. \"But it was a tough year,\" said Mr Monty Sumray, chair- man. \"The division met strong resistance to higher selling prices, exacerbated by the VAT increase during the second half of our financial year, while having to absorb higher costs. Net margins fell to 8.9 per cent, from 11.3 per cent. So, in order to safeguard our position with- out reducing manufacturing capacity or market share, we had to make substantial savings involving the reduc- tion of the division's workforce by 8 per cent.\" Fi's scientific and technical division increased its turnover to Â£10nm (Â£10.5m) despite cut- backs in its customers' bud- gets. Profit was down at Â£960,000 (Â£1.51m). Group earnings came out at 33.5p (40.2p) per share. An increased final dividend of 7.75p (7.25p) is recom- mended, making a total of 12.75p (11.25p), covered 2.6 times. The year-end cash balance stood at Â£7.8m. \"We are well placed to take advantage of an upturn in the economy, which appears more likely to occur in the second half of our current financial year,\" said Mr Sumray.",

The weak economic environ- ment had hit the commercial and industrial side in particu- lar as local authorities in the UK cut down on capital expen- diture and the pace of golf course development had fallen, said Mr Bob Dodsworth, chief eiecutive. In view of an unceitain out- look in the second half, the group decided that \"it is pru- dent not to declare a dividend until the results for the full year are known.\" The previous interim was 2.05p. Operating profit totalled S4.58m (Â£12.29m), reflecting a 68 per cent decline to 2t.5Am (Â£11.12m) in the contribution from the commercial grass machinery and industrial prod. ucts and vehicles division and a fall to Â£614,000 (Â£1.05m) ftom the consumer grass machinery business. Some property disposals resulted in a contribution to operating profit of Â£397,000 4Â£182,000). The result left Ransomes with a retained loss of Â£3.84m (Â£1.95m profit). Losses per share were 1.8p against earn- ings of 6.7p. The reversal came despite substantial cost-cutting and de- stocking which was launched in the first half. Poor sales in 1990 had left it with high stock levels. Meanwhile, 13 per cent of the workforce has been made redundant, resulting in exceptional costs of Â£362,000. Mr Dodsworth, warned that further consolidation of operations was likely to result in an extraordinary charge in the fall year.",

   "text_content" : "METSEC, the USM-quoted group which serves the build- ing products, electronic prod- ucts, engineering and construc- tion industries, suffered a downturn in the six months to June 30 with a pre-tax loss of Â£285,000, against a profit of Â£2.3m. Turnover for the period was up from Â£38.8m to Â£41.8m. Mr Keith Hirst, chairman, said at the annual meeting in May that the half year results would be disappointing. How- ever, the scale of the UK reces- sion and the effect on Metsec's business had been much deeper than predicted and had severely affected the group's profitability. The company had reduced the number of UK employees by 9.5 per cent and the ration- alisation of one main business and a number of peripheral ones had been carried out. Mr Hirst said that gearing had increased to 55 per cent but half of that related to acquisitions. Working capital was being cut and gearing should be reduced by the end of the year as the group returned to profits. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.7p. Losses per share were 1.51p, (earnings 9.83p).",

This wil result in Vansa being substantially a cash shell subject to the applicable rules of The Johannesburg Stock Exchange. ('the disposals\"). The disposals are subject to certain conditions precedent, the approval by shareholders of Vansa's disposal of Wnterveld and the approval of the appropriate statutory and regulatory authorities. AN risk and benefits in MS&A and the Barlow Rand chrome interests will pass to he purchasers from 1 October 1991. The disposals are an indivisible transaction considered by the Barlow Rand group to be strategically appropriate for the following reasons in principle: - the evidenced cyclicality of MS&A's earnings and ts significant capital expendiure requirements are typical of this commodity based business which has had a dsproportionate impact on the group; and - the proceeds of the disposal will have an immediate and significant positive effect on Barlow Rand's balance sheet and income statement. Looking forward, Barlow Rand will be well placed to pursue those investment opportunities able to generate the growth in earnings and dividends required to provide Barlow Rand shareholders with a real rate of return over time. Had the disposals taken place with effect from 1 October 1990 then the anticipated effect on Barlow Rand's consolidated results for the year ending 30 September 1991 would be to increase earnings per share by approximately 50 cents and tangible net asset value per share by 120 cents per share. Based on these assumptions the disposal of Winterveld would increase Vansa's earnings per share by approximately 5 cents and tangible not asset value by 28 cents per share for the year ending 30 September 1991. The disposals will not have a material effect on either the net asset value or earnings per share of Rand Mines. Circulars containing full details of the disposals and containing a notice of general meeting in the case of Vansa are in the course of preparation and will be posted to the shareholders of Barlow Rand and Vansa in due course.

   "text_content" : "\"the mode 'andinmpresiaonist art markets sent Christies International's interim pre-tax profits' plummeting from Â£40.1m to just Â£S3m. The auction house saw turn- over for the six months to June 30 halved from Â£105.2m to Â£50.2m, a further deterioration on the Â£L2m in the second half of the previous year. Modern 'and impressionist art, previously half of sales, fell by 90 per cent and out- weighed a 21 per cent rise in Old Masters which were boosted by Imelda Marcos' Phi- lippines collection. Nevertheless, the 160 Job cuts early in 1991, the first for 15 years, helped convert second half operating losses of Â£282,000 to a Â£453,000 profit. The group announced yesterday that a further 40 job losses later this year would bring the staff total below 1,400. A fall in cash balances to Â£15m from Â£30m in December 1990 and Â£52m in June 1990 pul- led net interest received down to Â£2.4m (Â£4.1m). Earnings of 0.98p (13.59p), only partly covered the main- tained interim dividend of 2.3p. Mr Christopher Davidge, managing director, said that mme mni suaes ox um Insiaenr Inumcient w maKe up ior iower acuvitny sisewnere ra.Â·.r-Â· Â·.Â·. Â·c, ~ rÂ·,r.Â· Â·Â·,.Â· while the second half would hardly hit the heady heights of 1989, there was a much greater mood of optimism around. * COMMENT Christies' impressive response to the recession at least allowed it to preserve the word \"profit\" in its interims, more than some analysts had expec- ted. Two thirds of its costs are auction and print costs and these fell back when turnover slumped. The cuts in fixed costs were also admirably prompt - the job cuts were announced on the last day of the 1990 season. Few are sug- gesting that impressionist prices will soar back to the heights of the late 1980s. But they may nonetheless bounce, and the present strength in furniture, silver and Old Mas- ters suggests that a modest upturn may be starting. On Â£10m pre-tax for the full year (Â£43.lm) and earnings of 3.3p (14.4p), the p/e of 54 certainly assumes that. Although the 24 per cent ADT stake continues to overhang the market, a sus- tained recovery would gradu- ally translate to a higher share price.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivor Duce AFTER INCURRING a loss of Â£2.35m in the second half of last year following an excep- tional charge of Â£2.34m, Quicks Group, the north-west and Mid- lands motor distributor, moved back into the black in the six months to June 30. Pre-tax profits, after excep- tional items of Â£330,000 (Â£1.17m) and employee share scheme - Â£18,000 against Â£85,000 - fell from Â£1.7m to Â£368,000. The profit, however, was achieved against turnover down from Â£126m to Â£107m. Mr Norman Quick, chair- man, said that although Traf- ford Park Leasing continued to suffer from unsatisfactory bro- ker-introduced business in the commercial vehicle market, he was confident that provisions being made throughout 1991 were adequate to cover any further defaults. There was no doubt, he said, that the group remained in a strong recession, with new car registrations for the half-year down 25 per cent on the previ- ous year and sales of commer- cial vehicles 40 per cent lower; the depressed level was con- tinuing in the second half. The interim dividend is halved to Ip - last year's final was reduced from 4p to ip - with earnings per share down to 1.6p compared with 7.2p.

Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said that both sales and rentals of the healthcare division con- tinued to expand through organic growth and the intro- duction of new products; the German subsidiary had increased its contribution and there has been strong growth in the US market. Difficulties in the sensors and systems division have been resolved. Mr Schild reported that the division is - now trading profitably again And there had been a signifi- cant influx of orders over the past few months.

Net assets up 12% at Second Alliance Net asset value of The Second Alliance Trust amounted to Â£13.61 at July 31, a rise of 12.2 per cent over the year. Directors attributed the rise to good showings in all mar- kets, particularly the US. Net revenue improved to Â£6.96m (Â£6.48m) for earnings of 36.1p (33.61p) per share. A pro- posed final distribution of 23.5p lifts the total to 35p (33p). Olives more than doubles to Â£534,000 A recovery was announced by Olives Holdings, the paper- making and property develop ment group, with pre-tax prof- its for the first half of 1991 more than doubled at Â£534,000, compared with E261,000. Turnover was more than Â£lm down at Â£1.46m (2.56m) but the cost of sales tumbled to Â£786,000 (Â£2.23m). Mr Michael Kent, chairman, pointed out that the limited turnover reflected not only the current state of the market but also the company's conservatism and the completion of its forward property sales. Continental Paper, the 40 per cent-owned associate, contin- ued its recovery, with much improved production and cost levels under the equity-owning new management. After tax of Â£172,000 (Â£85,000), earnings per share were 4.96p (2.29p); the interim dividend is maintained at 3p.

No interim dividend is pay- able but it is anticipated that a final dividend will be recom- mended.",

Pinnacle contributed Â£4.6m to the group's pre-tax profits of Â£25.6m in the year to end- March 1991, and represented Â£31.1m of its year-end net assets of Â£50m. Growing competition in rein- surance would soon have required Pinnacle to take on underwriting risks and commit more capital, said Mr Peter Presland, chief executive. Heath set up Pinnacle in the 1980s to specialise in \"time and distance\" policies, a highly-spe- cialised form of financial rein- surance which for many years enjoyed high margins and small risk. The purchaser already owns a Bermuda-based financial reinsurer, one of Pinnacle's main competitors. Some Â£20m of the proceeds would be used to cut Heath's debt of Â£45m, reducing gearing from 55 per cent to below 30 per cent. The balance could be used to expand the core broking business, Mr Presland said. To allow Centre Re to buy Pinnacle's business, not the whole company, Pinnacle would be sold first to Vertex, a new company owned by Pinna- cle's executive management, and the contracts then trans- ferred to Centre Re's subsid- iaries. Analysts had thought that long-standing litigation between Pinnacle and the liq- uidators of Mentor Insurance, the Bermuda insurer owned by Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co, might frustrate Pinnacle's sale, but Heath announced yes- terday the mutual release of all claims. The group has yet to declare the date of the extraordinary general meeting to approve the transaction.",

   "text_content" : "By Tim Coone in Dublin IRISH LIFE, the Republic's biggest insurer and fund man- ager, yesterday reported total premium income of IE324.9m (Â£297m) for the first six months of the year, an advance of IU4.5m on the same period in 1990. The company was privatised in July this year, and as indi- cated in its offer document, no interim dividend is to be paid, although in a statement to shareholders Mr Conor McCarthy, chairman, said that it was the intention to recom- mend a final of 5.44p for the current year. The company achieved 15 per cent growth to I128.4m in new business in recurring pre- mium sales in Ireland, its main focus of activity, and had a particularly strong showing through Interstate, its US sub- sidiary, with new business sharply ahead from IE17.9m to IE43.7m. Group pension business in Ireland was also buoyant recording a 29 per cent increase over last time. New single premium busi- ness, however, was down by 32 per cent, from IÂ£99.7m to I67.9m, a result of the fall in investment markets in Ireland in 1990. However, Mr McCarthy pointed out that this still repre- sented an increase in market share. New single premium busi- ness in the UK was unchanged at IE10.4m. Davy, the company's stock- brokers, said that the results were in line with expectations and that other companies had taken a similar \"hammering\" on single premiums in the first half of the year, but that an upturn is expected in the remainder of 1991. Meanwhile, Irish Life France, a wholly-owned subsid- iary, has received authorisa- tion to carry out both life and non-life business in France where it plans to invest IE25m over the next four years. \"We hope to start in early 1992\" the company said. One of the rationales behind the pri- vatisation was to develop the company's international insur- ance arms.",

   "text_content" : "-jr By Peggy Hollinger INTEREST CHARGES and rationalisation and redun- dancy costs knocked back tax- able profits at Scholes Group, the electrical installation com- pany, in the year to June 30. Profits fell 26 per cent to Â£4.58m pre-tax. The group also cut its final dividend from 5.22p to 3.4p, making a total of 5p (7.82p). Turnover rose 11 per cent to Â£67.3m (Â£60.5m). Mr Bill Rich- ards, finance director, said that virtually all of the increase in sales was due to the inclusion for 12 months of Dorman Smith, the industrial switchgear business bought in January last year. Interest charges were sharply higher, also due to the acquisition, at Â£1.63m (Â£911,000). Mr Reg Harrington, chair- man, said he was encouraged by the group's performance. Scholes had maintained its overall margins despite a tough trading period, he said. Staff was reduced by about 13 per cent and management changed in three divisions. Rationalisation and redun- dancy costs resulted in an exceptional charge of Â£1.03m (Â£446,000). Mr Harrington stressed the importance of the joint ven- ture with Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss/Swedish engineering company. This would leave the group, which currently derives about 90 per cent of sales from the UK and some 45 per cent from the residential housing sector, well positioned to take advantage of the single Euro- pean market in 1992. The joint venture had also benefited Wylex, the group's principal subsidiary which manufactures circuit breakers and fuseboxes, by the inclu- sion of ABB products. Earnings per share fell from 11.2p to 8.5p. * COMMENT The news of a cut in dividend did not shake the shares, which rose 3p to close at 111p. The yield is a healthy 5.8 per cent, well above the market average. Scholes already has a reputation for quality and solid management, and the joint venture with ABB can only enhance that. The result- ing broadened product range has steadied the order book and it should show a consist- ent Improvement over the next year. The biggest problem remains recession. If the latest news of an upturn in housing starts to bear fruit, then Scholes could benefit quite sig- nificantly. On the worst-case scenario, forecasts are running at Â£5m profits for next year, giving prospective earnings per share of about 9p. How- ever, the bulls are looking for Â£6.7m, with earnings of 12p. The shares look cheap at the moment.",

It also marks a further retreat by the Barlow Rand group from the mining and mineral processing field. MS&A's ferro-alloy operations, together with the chrome interests of the Barlow Rand group, will be acquired by Samancor, a Gencor subsid- iary, for about R575m. Saman- cor will fund the acquisition by issuing 22m new shares at R27.75 each. 'One half of these new shares will be taken up by Anglo American and its associate De Beers, rai their total inter- est in Samancorfrom almost 25 per cent to almost 28 per cent. The remainder will be taken up by Genmin, the mining and minerals arm of&Gencor. MS&A's stainless steel inter- ests, valued at about RSOum, will be included in the pro- posed Columbus project, a 50-50 venture between High- veld Steel, an Anglo American subsidiary, and Samancor. Highveld will flpance its 50 per cent acquisition by issuing 16m shares at R15.65 each, while Samancor will pay for its 50 per cent in cash. On the ferrochrome side, Samancor's existing capacity will be lifted by the MS&A acquisition to about Im tonnes a year from 640,000 tonnes. Mr Brian Gilbertson, execu- tive chairman of Genmin, said he believed this would lead to closer ties with its customers, the world's main steel produc- ers, who preferred to deal with uarge suppliers. ue aiso nopes the 41W will boost the weak wqrld ferrochrome price beause Saniancor will be rationalising production. The del also means the Col- umbus project will benefit from the synergies between MS&A's expertise in the pro- duction and marketing of stainless steel and Highveld's steel-making skills. Also, MS&A's existing plant can be used as a foundation for Col- umbus, bringing possible capi- tal cost cuts of between R500m and RIbn from an envisaged R3bn. Barlow Rand announced its intention in May to reduce its stake in MS&A because the volatility of its commodity- based earnings was overshad- owing the performance of the group's core industrial inter- ests. The disposal will generate R180m interest a year, more than MS&A could have contrib- uted in the short term.",

   "text_content" : "By Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam DAS, the Dutch truck and van maker, is to raise F1250m ($132m) through an issue of compulsory convertible prefer- ence shares. The issue is designed to bolster the com- pany's equity ratios. News of the F1250m capital- raising exercise follows indica- tions last month that DAS would seek new funds of at least F1200m. The company's single biggest shareholder is British Aerospace, with a stake of 16 per cent. Other major shareholders include the Van Doorne family of the Netherlands and DSM, the Dutch chemicals group. DAS plans to issue 12.5m preference shares priced at Fl20 each. The company's ordi- nary shares closed at Fl21.60 yesterday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The preference shares will pay a cumulative dividend of 10.5 per cent per year. The shares must be converted into DAS ordinary shares in four instalments on June 1 1995 through to June 1 1998. The conversion price will be based on DAF's average share price during the preceding April. This will be adjusted for the dividend announced in March, and the actual conver- sion price will also be 10 per cent less than the April trading price. DAS is reserving the right to insist on early conversion if there is a fundamental or structural change in the own- ership of its share capital. In this case, the discount on the conversion price will be raised closer to actual trading prices. The share issue has been underwritten by a consortium of banks led by ABN Amro of the Netherlands. Subscriptions open in early October. DAF's announcement in August that it was planning a preference share issue coin- cided with the publication of first-half figures showing that iUs noa Inaa had addeirdllm in Fl 179.1m from Fl 32.1m a year earlier. At the same time, group capital and reserves rep- resented just 23.7 per cent of total assets, against 27.5 per cent at the end of 1990. DAS has chosen compulsory conver- sion of the preference shares to underline its desire to return to the usual structure of its share capital by the end of the decade. The company, which has been hit hard by the recession on the UK truck market, has predicted that its figures will improve in the second half of 1991. DAF's strong dependence on the UK market is a legacy of its acquisition in 1987 of Ley- land Trucks. The sharp con- traction of the UK market in early 1991 and the growth of the German market since that country's unification have reshaped the European truck market, leading to a decline in the Anglo-Dutch company's overall market share.",

   "text_content" : "IBy Itetarine CampIInln 'Frankfurt FIVE EMPLOYEES of Dresdner Bank, the second- Slargst German bank, have resned following alegations bythe management that they violated bank rules governipg bonds and equities traisac- tions. Dresdner said it had found evidence that two directors and three other employees had broken internal rules and the five subsequently handed in resignations at the end of last week. The names of the employees were not released. There were allegations yes- terday that they had reserved paper for their own account in new issues before making allo- cations to customers. Dresdner stressed that the grounds for dismissal did not constitute a breach of insider trading rules. The resignations, from the Eurobond new issues department and a section which co-ordinates sales of securities through the branch network, add to the scandal which has been grow- ing in the Frankfurt financial community during the past three months. They .also add to worries about the adequacy of supervi- sion of the finance industry in Germany. Frankfurt city prosecutors are examining at least 150 cases of possible tax evasion and two cases of possible fraud by dealers at various banks and brokers. In an inquiry into Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank- ing group, the bank dismissed its chief equity warrants dealer. That case indirectly sparked the Dresdner inquiry. The Frankfurt bourse insider dealing commission has termi- nated an investigation into Deutsche Bank, without dis- covering rule violations. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank indicated it intends to intro- duce an \"Anglo-Saxon\" code of conduct, under which traders will be severely restricted in trading on their own account. Shortly after the insider investigation began, Deutsche banned dealers from trading for themselves in the securities in which they deal for the bank. More far-reaching changes are expected soon. There are no criminal penal- ties for insider trading in Ger- many. However, the current controversy has added urgency to' efforts in Bonn to draft legislation complying with the EC directive on insider trading. Supervision of the voluntary insider code drawn up by banks and industry rests with separate commissions at the eight regional stock exchanges which operate within a narrow framework and possess few legal powers of enforcement. In the AEG case in 1986, it was the supervisory board member himself who admitted to trading on advance informa- tion of the company's sale to Daimler-Benz. Dresdner headquarters: case adds to scandal The Frankfurt commission's latest inquiry concentrated on recommendations from the now-dismissed Deutsche options dealer in a television programme.",

   "text_content" : "By John Burton in Stockholm SHARE TRADING in Fermenta, the Swedish bio- technology group, and its finance company subsidiary, Independent, was suspended yesterday on the Stockholm bourse. The move increased expectations that a new long-term loan package for Independent will be announced today. Independent has been in talks with a bank consortium about new long-term financing of SKr6bn ($980m) after mounting credit losses due to bad property loans. It reported a loss of SKrl20m dur- ing the first four months of 1991. Independent is believed to be in a stronger position than other Swedish finance compa- nies, such as Nyckeln and Gamlestaden, that have col- lapsed as a result of the reces- sion. It has reduced the amount of its outstanding loans from SKr20bn to less than SKr6bn, with most of these loans now involved in leasing contracts rather than the property mar- ket. The credit losses at Indepen- dent contributed to the SKrl38m loss that Fermenta reported during the first four months of 1991. Fermenta is controlled by the Industrivar- den, the Swedish investment group. Mr Bert Sjolin and Mr Bertil Holmberg, the chairman and chief executive of Fermenta, were forced to resign last week after they failed to report cer- tain share transactions to the Fermenta board. Analysts believe that Ser- menta's owners used the inci- dent as a pretext to oust the two executives over their deci- sion in 1988 to diversify Ser- menta into financial services, while reducing its activity in the chemical and antibiotics sector, its original business. Although the strategy ini- tially held promise, problems in the country's finance sector since last autumn have proved it was a mistake. Independent's problems have also caused its other main shareholder, the Swedish transport group Bilspedition, to sell its shares recently at a loss, and reduce its stake to less than 10 per cent. Fermenta, which was founded by Mr Refaat El-Sayed, was at the centre of Sweden's biggest post-war financial scan- dal in 1986 and it has since held an unofficial listing on the Stockholm bourse. Following the downfall of Mr El-Sayed, Fermenta was taken over by Industrivarden, which has an extensive share portfo- lio in large Swedish companies and also owns the beverage container group PLM.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Campeau Agrees Shake-up Plan with O&Y after Year",
   "text_content" : "By mrnard Simon In Torontc CAMPEAU Corporation, the ailing Canadian property devel- oper, has reached agreement on a restructuring plan with its biggest shareholder and creditor; the Reicbmann fam- ily's Olympia& York Develop- ments, after more than a year of negotiation. Campeau, whose founder Mr Robert Campeau directed the disastrous US(lObn acquisition of two of the US's biggest department store groups in the late 1980s, is hoping that O&Y's approval of the plan will clear the way for accep- tance by other creditors. The crux of the restructuring is a debt-for-equity swap, in which holders of unsecured debt as well as preference and ordinary shares are to be issued new common shares in Campeau. Mr Stanley Hartt, Campeau's president, said the arrange- ment would mean that \"the company will once again have positive equity, and our credi- tors and shareholders will have the opportunity over the long term to recover value on their investments\". O&Y is also buying the 50 per cent it does not own of Scotia Plaza, Campeau's 68-sto- rey flagship office building in downtown Toronto. The deal is estimated to be worth between C$200m (US$175m) and C$400m. Robert Campeau: presided over disastrous aequisition Campeau Corp will not receive any cash; instead, O &Y will take over Campeau's financing obligations for the project. The balance of the purchase price will be used to repay O&Y loans which were secured by the property. O&Y has an 11 per cent equity stake in Campeau, C$400m outstanding in deben- tures and C$235m in secured loans, including accrued inter- est. Campeau said yesterday that it intended to submit the restructuring plan to an Ontario court by the end of October. In the meantime, Campeau is seeking a court order freezing its obligations under the Companies Credi- tors' Arrangements Act. The plan's implementation ,depends on the successful reor- ganisation of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores, the two US groups which have been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since January 1990. The link between the two is required to satisfy another of Campeau's largest creditors, the US shopping mall developer Edward J DeBartolo. Campeau has guaranteed a secured loan of US$480m from Mr DeBartolo to the US retail group. Campeau yesterday reported a first-half profit of C$119m, or C$2.55 a share, compared with a loss of C$373m, or C$8.48, a year earlier. The return to profitability was solely due to gains from sales of property totalling C$210m. The company has put most of its property portfolio on the block as part of its efforts to remain afloat. From this year, Campeau no longer includes the US department store subsidiaries in its accounts. Under the Chapter 11 reorganisation, the Canadian company is not expected to retain any significant ownership in Federated and Allied.",

   "text_content" : "By Karen Zagor in New York NIKE, the US sports shoe and apparel maker, yesterday turned in record first-quarter earnings when analysts had predicted declines. The Oregon-based company said earnings for the three months to the end of August rose 14 per cent to $114.4m, or $1.50 a share, from $99.7m, or $1.41, a year earlier. Revenues grew 14 per cent to $947.2m, from $833.6m a year earlier. Mr Philip Knight, chairman, attributed the improvement to strong consumer demand around the world. First-quarter results also benefited from increased \"at-once\" sales - those for immediate delivery rather than those ordered in advance. At-once sales jumped 45 per cent in the quarter. The company is fighting the recession's impact on con- sumer spending by reducing its domestic footwear inventory to 10.8m pairs from 16.5m at May 31. Nike said its lower inven- tory levels had reduced its short-term borrowing needs. Despite the strong quarter, Nike said second-quarter earn- ings might not match the 77 cents a share of a year ago. During the first quarter, Nike's consolidated gross mar- gin rose to 38.7 per cent from 37.4 per cent last year. How- ever, sales and administrative expenses rose to 18.2 per cent of first-quarter revenues against 17.6 per cent. Domestic revenues for sports shoes increased 5 per cent in the quarter. International reve- nues rose 37 per cent, spurred by growth in Europe.",

The first flight marks the beginning of a two-year test programme, involving five air- craft. The first C-17 is sched- uled to be delivered late next year. The flight comes a few weeks after a Pentagon report claimed that McDonnell Doug- las was likely to exceed the $6.6bn cost ceiling on the pro- gramme by between $1.4bn and 2.6bn, but the company denied this and said that it expected to end not far above the con- tract price.",

However, the latest twist could complicate its efforts to emerge from bankruptcy. A US district Judge has ruled that LTV does not have to give its underfunded pension plans - with liabilities of about $3bn - preferential treatment over the company's other creditors. If upheld, the ruling would mean that the company would only have to pay out a fraction of its pension liabilities, in the same way that creditors of bankrupt companies usually receive less than 100 cents on the dollar in any financial reor- ganisation. The ruling is a severe blow to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as it could encourage other compa- nies to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts to reduce pension fund liabilities, which would then fall on the agency. The PBGC plans to appeal against the judge's dec- sion. This year, the two sides reached an agreement under which LTV agreed to pump $950m into its pension fund. However, that pact ran into strong criticism from the com- pany's other creditors, and LTV, after making an initial payment, agreed to seek the approval of these creditors before making more payments The PBGC and the federal Department of Labor responded last month by ask- ing the courts to force the com- pany to pay immediately into the un derfunded plai.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kviln rowin in Sydney PACIFIC DUNLOP, the diversified Australian indus- trial group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall in net profits to A*240m (US$190m) for the year to the end of June, on, revenue down 2.5 per cent to A5Sbn. The group also announced a one-for-five rights issue to raise A$672.5m to restore borrowing levels and cash reserves follow- ing its acquisition of 89 per cent of Petersville Sleigh from the Adelaide Steamship group for A$352m. The group said it would issue 156.4m ordinary shares at A$4.30 each, fully underwritten by Potter Warburg Capital markets and E.L. & C. Bail- lieu. Before the announcement, the shares closed 4 cents lower at A$5.18 on the Australian Stock Exchange. Pacific Dunlop said the acquisition of Petersville Sleigh, one of Australia's lead- ing foods groups, would add to its future earnings base and promote growth. The acquisition, which came after the end of the financial year, followed expenditure of A$176m on acquisitions and A$179m on new plant and equipment during 1990-1991. Mr John Gough, chairman, said the reduction in net prof- its was \"satisfactory\" given the severity of the' recession in Australia and other countries, including the US. Mr Gough said the recession had interrupted the company's growth, but action had been taken to increase market share and increase productivity and competitiveness. The group had \"vigorously pursued\" its policy of achiev- ing greater flexibility between Australian and offshore manu- facturing to strengthen its posltlon against lmport comped ton follo! the lowering Of Australian t protection. Pacific Dunlop has success- fully relocated manufacturing activities offshore to escape high Australian production costs, and has assets of more than A$50Om in the Asia Pacific area, mostly in produc- tion facilities for latex dipping, and cable and footwear manu- facturing. Mr Gough said Pacific Dun- lop was budgeting for a moder- ate improvement in net profits in 1991-1992, but did not expect to reach the record level of A$801m achieved in 1969-1990. Any profit improvement would be in the second half, due to the forecast slow recov- ery from recession in Austra- lia, he said. Results in the current half-year were expec- ted to be in line with the sec- ond half of last year. Pacific Dunlop said its Pacific Brands consumer prod- ucts division had \"a much improved year\" following restructuring which resulted in increased market share and greater efficiency. The division increased operating profits by 11 per cent to A$77m. The group said its distribu- tion activities bore the brunt of the recession. The division sus- fered a 33 per cent fall in oper- ating profits to A$60m despite an improvement in efficiency. Healthcare group profits were down by AM2m to A$g6m, and automotive profits down 35 per cent to A$41m. However, profits from building and con- struction products were up A$2m to A$158m. The directors said the total dividend would be increased to 21 cents per share, fully franked, from 20 cents last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown NINE Network Australia, a quoted subsidiary of Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, yesterday reported net profits of A$30m (US$23m) for 1990-1991, completing a strong recovery from net losses of A$203m in the previous year. Nine has been restructured since being acquired by Mr Packer in August 1990 from Bond Media, the television arm of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corpo- ration Holdings, which earlier bought the network from Mr Packer for A$lbn. The 1990 loss followed Mr Packer's decision to write off much of the book value of broadcasting licences owned by the network. Nine said two equity raisings and sales of non-core assets had reduced its debt burden to A$154m at the end of the sinan- cial year on June 30, from AS690m at the time of the sale. The impact of the asset sales was reflected in a 6.8 per cent decline in group sales to A$471m. However, the decline in the network's revenue was cushioned by its consistent lead in the ratings for the three commercial television chan- nels. Mr David Leckie, managing director, said the improved result was achieved in spite of the difficult economic climate caused by an 18-month reces- sion which reduced advertising volumes. However, Mr Leckie said the network's Sky Channel arm, which supplies sports and other programmes to clubs, hotels, racecourses and off- course betting shops, made a significant contribution for the first time. He said the restructuring carried out by Conspress had increased shareholders' funds to AS660m from A$395m. The directors said there would be no final dividend, but indicated the company expec- ted to begin paying dividends again during the current year.",

   "text_content" : "By Joyce Quok in Singapore INCHCAPE BERHAD, the Singapore-based trading and services group, yesterday blamed weak interim results on lower demand in the after- math of the Gulf war and the recession in the US and Europe. Group turnover fell 9 per cent to S$397.3m (US$233.7m) for the six months to June, while pre-tax profits slid to S$35.7m from S$56.6m. Extraor- dinary gains were down to S8723,000 from A$14.4m, while earnings per share were 12.5 cents against 22.4 cents. * Singapore Aerospace, the government-controlled defence company, recorded higher group turnover of S$154.5m (US$90.8m) for the half-year to June from SS93.6m a year ear- lier. Pre-tax profits rose to SS13.9m from S$9.9m. However, taxes tripled from S$1.3m to S$4.4m due to the expiry of pio- neer status for a subsidiary.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Hall in Wellington CORPORATE Investments, the diversified investment group, yesterday announced its net profits had nearly halved to NZ$16.1m (US$9.42m) in the year to June 30, compared with NZ$28.lm the previous year because of the depressed state of the Australian and New Zea- land economies. Mr Peter Masfen, chairman, said the company's tourism and property sectors had recorded losses which had more than offset earnings from increased profits in its forestry, wine and industrial develop- ments. The company was, how- ever, budgeting for an improved profit this year. Sales and other gross income fell 3.1 per cent to NZ$614m. Mr Masfen said the improved per- formances in the primary pro- duction and forestry sectors were encouraging, Pre-tax earnings from the forestry sec- tor grew 9.27 per cent to NZ$8.9m. This division includes Nelson Pine Forests, the region's main producer of medium-density fibreboard. The NZ$60m expansion of this mill would significantly enhance profitability this year, the company said. Montana Wines, part of the primary products division, boosted pre-tax earnings by 14.61 per cent to NZ$16.9m. -Montana had maintained its 45 per cent share of the domestic wine market and increased export sales by 14 per cent. Montana has just completed a NZ$35m investment pro- gramme and further capital requirements would be mini- mal, Mr Masfen said. Tourism and travel interests, which include Newmans in the US, Australia and New Zea- land, registered an 87 per cent fall in tax-paid earnings with a NZ$4.9m loss. Mr Masfen said directors were confident the industry would return to previ- ous high growth rates. Indus- trial sector profits rose 2.2 per cent to NZ$5.17m. Property investments fell 86 per cent to NZ$463,000."

Dairy Farm announced profits down to US$54.4m in the six months to the end ol Jane, compared with $57.8m in the same period a year arlier. The -company is maintaining its interim dividend at 1.3- cents a share. Turnover gained 59 per cent to 2.22bn due to fail contribu tions from Simago and Wool worth's in New Zeaiand, also acquired last year. Mr Simon Keswick, chair- man, said operations in Aus- tralia and Hong Kong per- formed well. In Hong Kong, the Wellcome chain of super- markets is installing point-of- sale scanning to combat a labour shortage and high oper- ating costs. Kwik Save, the UK retailer in which Dairy Farm has a 25 per cent stake, also performed well in the first half. However, Mr Keswick said results for the year were likely to be affected by a price war in Australia and from continuing losses at Simago."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Karen Zagor In New York and Tracy Corrigan in London US TREASURIES moved modestly higher yesterday in thin trading as the market absorbed last week's easing of monetary conditions. In late trading, the Trea- sury's bellwether 80-year bond was A higher at 102%, yielding 7.92 per cent, At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year note was unchanged for a yield of 6.15 per cent. The Federal Reserve arranged three-day fixed-collat- eral system repurchase agree- ments when Fed funds were trading at 5& per cent, above the Fed's perceived target of 5'/% per cent. The operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, was expected. In late trading, Fed funds were quoted at 5%/ per cent. Economists expect a quiet week in the wake of Friday's easing. This week's slate of economic data is not expected to have much of an impact on the market. Industrial produc- tion figures released tomorrow are expected to show a 0.5 per cent increase in August. * POLITICAL concerns again outweighed technical consider- ations in the UK gilts market yesterday. Gilt prices opened firmer, boosted by two opinion polls, published at the week- end, which showed that the Conservative government's lead over the opposition Labour party is growing. However, economic data released yesterday met a mixed reception. A sharp 1.4 per cent drop in retail sales in August, theoretically good news for bonds, proved discouraging, since any sign that the UK economy is not climbing out of recession is bad news for the government. So gilt prices slipped back, largely eradicat- ing earlier gains. Industrial production data, including a 0.8 per cent increase in manufacturing pro duction in July, was inter- preted as an indication that the battering of the manufacturing sector of the economy may be ending. Again, this positive reaction contradicts the con- ventional wisdom, as economic GOVERNMENT BONDS growth is normally negative for the bond market. Although the gilts market made little further progress yesterday, traders say that, provided polls continue to show a Conservative lead, downward pressure on gilt yields will be maintained. Such sentiment is expected to ensure a successful long-dated gilt auction next week, details of which are to be announced today. The short end of the market remains particularly well underpinned, as expectations of a further cut in UK interest rates mount. * JAPANESE markets were closed yesterday, but expecta- tions of a cut in the official discount rate, following the cut in US rates, are likely to boost the market when it reopens. The holiday in Japan damp- ened activity in other markets. Government bond prices in France and Germany ended lit- tle changed in low volume. French bond prices fell about % point, on disappointment that the Bank of France had passed up another opportunity to ease rates. In Sweden, government bond prices were marked down % point to % point, after elec- tions at the weekend unseated the ruling Social Democrats. No new government has been put forward yet, and dealers expect activity to remain low until the uncertainty has been resolved.

   "text_content" : "By Katharine Campbell in Frankfurt FOREIGN investors purchased DM6bn of German fixed income securities in July, up from DM2bn in June, according to the Bundesbank. The figures demonstrate how a constitutional court ruling at the end of June had surpris- ingly little immediate effect on investor sentiment abroad. The court ruled that the gov- ernment must tighten up pro- cedures for collecting invest- ment income tax by the beginning of 1993. Bonn is expected to unveil proposals in early October. The surprise foreign interest partly reflects confidence that the solution is virtually certain to apply to German taxpayers alone, unlike the disastrous withholding tax imposed at the beginning of 1989 which also drew foreigners into the net. Analysts, underlining that ministers have learnt from their mihtakes. arnme also that much of the money that flowed out of the country in 1988 and 1989 stayed abroad, hence reducing the size of any fur- ther possible outflows. Mr Hung Tran, director of global fixed income research at Deutsche Bank, says interna- tional investors have begun rebalancing portfolios, taking profits in the high-yielding markets such as Spain, and redressing under-weightings in the core German market.",

   "text_content" : "By Chrlrtlna Lamb in Rio de Janeiro BRAZIL moved nearer to a e ational bourse yester- wita thhe linking of eight of th counii y's nine exchanges tifo a National Electronic System (Senn) with a the move towards a n hook-up was marred by the determination of Bra- ail's largest exchange, Sao Paulo, to remain independent, a decision likely to heighten the battle for stock market supremacy with the Rio de Janeiro exchange which is co-ordinating Senn. The Sao Paulo exchange is responsible for 60 per cent of national trading compared to Rio's 35 per cent. Mr Francisco de Souza Dan- tas, president of the Rio exchange, said yesterday: \"We're not trying to create a dispute with Sao Paulo, but obviously we hope our index will eventually become the principal index whether or not Sao Paulo agrees to partici- pate.\" He added that he believed Sao Paulo had pulled out of merger negotiations since much of Sao Paulo's business is transacted by brokers from regional exchanges. The Sao Paulo brokers thought they would lose market share if they entered the national trad- inB link. SIenn brings together exchanges as far apart as that of the extreme south and Bah- ia-Sergipe-Alagoas In the north east and will enable regional brokers to trade nationally without having to go. throu Rio and Sao Paulo or pay com- mission to those exchanges. Mr Dantas says he hopes the new system will facilitate integra- tion with other markets in Latin America. Protocols with the bourses of Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Mexico have been signed. The new index will be known as I-Senn and based on a weighted average of the 50 most traded shares on the eight exchanges. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining com- pany, currently carries the largest weighting with 48.11 per cent while Telebras, the state telecommunications com- pany, is responsible for 9.84 per cent. The index will be adjusted quarterly. Brazil's markets, which were opened to direct foreign invest- ment in June, have seen a spectacular turnabout this year after ending 1990 as the world's worst performing emerging market."

   "text_content" : "By Emiko Terazono in Tokyo NET ASSETS of Japanese investment trust funds fell in August for the sixth consecu- tive month, reflecting the fal- tering Tokyo stock market and deteriorating investor confi- dence. According to the Investment Trusts Association, net fund assets fell to Y42,666.5bn, the lowest level since 1987. The month-on-month decline of Y1,868bn is the largest this year. Individuals are the main investors in investment trust funds. The sluggish stock market has also damaged returns on stock investments, and most trust funds have reported losses. Pre-maturity withdrawals totalled Y1,300bn. Newly-estab- lished stock investment funds totalled Y386.6bn, the lowest figure since August 1985, while stock and bond combined investment funds were Y946.5bn, the lowest since April 1983. Net assets of \"chukoku\" medium-term government note funds fell for the 10th consec- utive month, to Y3,061.4bn, but the net assets of funds for bond investments rose by Y119bn from the previous month to Y11,747.2bn.",

Risk asked more than 70 leading banks and Investment houses to name the best banks and brokers in the interbank market. Instruments such as interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate (\"caps\", \"collars\", and \"floors\") and currency options, and swap- tions, were separated into cur- rencies. According to Risk \"the mar- kets are now far too diverse and complek\" for any one house to dominate all lines of business. Bankers Trust, Bar- clays and J.P.

Barclays topped the sterling sector of the currency swaps ranking. * The South Australian Gov- ernment Financing Authority (Safa) has bought back and cancelled A$104.8m of bonds, Reuter reports from Adelaide.

   "article_dc_title" : "Zero-coupon Issues Show Investors' Bullish Mood",
   "text_content" : "By 8.n0. London . THE BULLISH sentiment in the international bdmliiarket was underlined by the launch of zero-coupon deals in both theB Ecu and sterling sectors yesterday. Credit Local ds France, the French state agency which lends to local authorite, came with an Ecu750m deal, later increased to Eculbn, lead-man- aged by Paribas Capital Mar- kets. The 10-year deal was re- offered to investors at a fixed price of 43.10, where the yield is 8.78 per cent. Zero-coupon bonds attract buying from investors positive about bond market prospects. Issued at a deep discount, the bonds offer full exposure to the market for a fraction of the initial outlay required to buy a conventional bond. In addition, the duration (the spread of cash returns to the investor through the life of the bond) of a 10-year zero coupon issue is comparable to a 20- year conventional issue. For example, Italy's 9% per cent 20-year bond issue has a duration of 9.37 years. A 10- year zero-coupon bond has a duration of 10 years, because the return to the investor is concentrated entirely at the maturity date. date. The Crdit Local deal met with strong demand, mainly from European investment- institutions, trading at or above the fixed re-offer price through-out the day. In the sterling sector, Nationwide Anglia Building Society also launched a Â£100m zero-coupon deal, lead man- aged by Hambros. The seven- INTMRNATIONAL BONDS year bonds were priced at 50.945 to yield 70 basis points more than UK government bonds, a spread which tight- ened sightly during the day. More fagile sentiment in the Australian dollar sector was tested yesterday, with Com- monwealth Bank of Australia and State Bank of New South Wales both launched A$100m deals via Deutsche Bank. The five-year State Bank issue was said by participants to be the better received, attracting both retail and insti- tutional buying. The 10-year maturity chosen by the Com- monwealth Bank was said to appeal almost exclusively to institutional investors. State Dank paper traded at less 1.60 bid, inside full fees of 1.75 per cent. Commonwealth bank paper traded at less 1% bid, against iull fees of 2% per cent. CCCE, the French state agency which lends to develop- ing countries, came with the first Eurobond issue since it lost the guarantee of the gov- ernment earlier this year. The FFrlbn 10-year deal, lead-managed by Credit Com- mercial de France, was priced to yield 39 basis points over French government bonds. The lead manager said the yield spread would have been five basis points less if the govern- ment guarantee still applied. CCCE has since been awarded a triple-A credit rat- ing by Standard & Poor's, the US credit rating agency. The European Investment Dank added SFr200m to its out- standing SFr400m 6% per cent seven-year bond issue - one of the benchmarks of the Swiss bond market - lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation.

   "text_content" : "vsauAA^ J ualu By Simon London ECU BONDS have rallied strongly in the secondary mar- ket over the past month, fuelled by hopes of a political agreement that will ensure a future for the aspiring single European currency. The yield spread of 10-year Ecu bonds over German gov- ernment bunds has fallen to below 40 basis points, the low- est level ever. The rally has been given impetus by speculation that the Ecu will be \"hardened\" against other European curren- dcies. In particular, the Dutch gov- ernment's proposal for a two- tier approach to monetary union has excited interest. This would allow the core European states to move towards monetary union soon, possibly via a hardened Ecu. The hardened Ecu would remain a basket currency, but one that could not be devalued against any of the currencies in the basket. In this case, the Ecu would be the strongest currency in the European monetary system and the yield on Ecu bonds should fall to the lowest level in the EC. Ecu bond yields would be level with those of D-Mark bonds, if not lower. Hence, investors believing that the Ecu will be hardened also believe that yields will fall to the level of bunds - pres- enting holders of Ecu bonds with a capital gain.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Broker Drafts Plan to Boost Coffee Earnings",
   "text_content" : "By David Blackwell ONE OF the world's leading coffee trade houses has ted plans that it believes could boost the annual export earn- ings of coffee exporters by more than half. Such an increase - equiva- lent to $S.5bn - would take the world coffee trade back to the level it enjoyed before the collapse of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system in July 1989. E.D. & F. Man, the London- based trade house, has pro- duced its plan just a week before the ICO annual meeting, which starts next Monday. So far, market attention has been focused on the attempt by Bra- zil and Colombia, the world's two leading producers, to get agreement among producers on a scheme to retain 10 per cent of exportable production. Man says the retention plan \"appears to have been devel- oped as a short-term solution in the absence of political con- sensus on the future of the ICO ... We feel that stocks retention should be seen as a transitional process, leading into and consistent with a new international coffee agreement which would subsequently enter into force.\" The collapse in world coffee prices has left producers unable to cover their costs, and \"there is growing evidence that farms are being neglected and coffee quality is declining\". A new coffee agreement needs to guarantee supplies of quality coffees at remunerative prices through a system that is flexi- ble, market-driven and pro- vides enough stability to pro- vide long-term planning. This could be done by creat- ing a single world market; by the use of selective and flexible quotas; and through other measures including promotion and diversification, Man suggest. The single market is required to stop the recreation of one of the biggest faults in the old agreement, which led to consumer countries outside the ICO getting coffee at knockdown prices. Consumers outside the ICO should be given incentives to join, says Man. Quotas for arabica and robusta coffees should be inde- pendent of one another and have their own price ranges. Countries producing both types should have two separate quotas. Producers would have to hold verified reserves in order to guarantee supplies. According to Man, such mea- sures would lift Brazil's export earnings from $1.46bn in 1990-91 to $2.4bn in 1992-93, and Colombia's from $1.42bn to $2bn. However, producers who feel they are \"winning\" in the free market may be unwilling to compromise, it admits.",

Dealers said the losses reflected merchant sales of cash metal, which established a discount of around $25 compared with a slight premium last week. The market has shrugged off production cuts by Inco and Falconbridge, as well as news that Inco Indonesia is to shut one of its three furnaces for five months from November for an overhaul. Demand prospects are poor, and the market could fall towards $7,500 if there are no further production cuts.

Liquidation and technical selling hit aluminium prices after chart support was breached at $1,250 a tonne for three-month metal. On the London bullion market, gold advanced on the back of gains in silver, which saw some follow-through buying after Friday's cut in the US discount rate. But gold sentiment remains bearish, with operators expecting further retreats unless significant physical uptake is seen. In Chicago soyabeans were holding sharp gains at midday in reaction to forecasts for possible frost this week in the US Midwest, where beans are still vulnerable.

   "article_dc_title" : "Big Uranium Producer Sees Gloomy Price Outlook",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown inSydney URANIUM PRICES are unlikely to strengthen for the next two years, Energy Resources of Australia, one of the world's largest uranium producers, said yesterday. ERA, which Is65per cent owned by North Broen Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, said in its annual report that revenue and profits would fall unless there was a \"funda- mental change\" in market con- ditions. \"The years immedi- ately ahead will be ateting time for ERA, indeed so al uranium producers,\" the board said. Uranium prices have fallen from US$40 to US$9 a lb on the spot market over the last decade, and are now below the cost of production at ERA's Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. Mr Richard Knight, manag- ing director, said ERA had become a major buyer of ura- nium on the spot market to fulfil US contracts and main- tain global market share. He added, however, that it intended to give priority to sec- uring federal government approval for the development of the Jabiluka. uranium deposit, a few kilometres from Ranger. Jabiluka was acquired Rod a Ur1a Ani m, the Na . blian producer in Oth rL pgrot h announced a 24 per cut aIn production as a result of the weak uranium market, writes Philip Gawith in Johannes beurg. Production at osnl will decrease to a level of 2,5M: hort tons (2,000 lb ach) a year with effect from Septembe 26. from the psment level of 850 tons a year. Thi means tha mine will be operati# at about half capacity.

Mr Lese sid the strcturng programme would lower the unit costs of R ng production bring production closer to actual ontracted aleof uranium and make the company more competitive for future sales opportunities. Despithe the adversity, osing is confildent that it has promising long-term prospects. It believes the stockpile over- hanging the market will decrease, improving the price. for A$125m from Pancontinen- tal earlier this year after Pan- continental failed to persuade the government to relax regu- lations limiting Australian ura- nium production to three named mines. Mr Knight said ERA hoped to bring it into production by 199495, when it forecasts a rise in uranium prices following a drawdown from stocks. \"We are about to launch into a sea- sibility study, which will take about 18 months, and we will then present our case to the government,\" he said. The ruling Labor Party has said the regulations will not be relaxed, but the opposition Lib- eral Party has said it will allow development of Jabiluka if it wins the federal election, due by 1993.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown AUSTRALIA'S FEDERAL government yesterday urged mining companies not to act on threats to divert exploration expenditure overseas following the rejection of proposals for gold and uranium mines in the Northern Territory. The government recently blocked plans for a gold mine at Coronation Hill after aborig- ines said that mining would disturb a sleeping spirit. Minis- ters have also refused to relax regulations on uranium mining to allow development of the Jabiluka uranium deposit. However, Mr Alan Griffiths, the federal governments resources minister, told a min- ing conference here that the industry should not interpret the decisions as evidence of a negative approach to mining by the government. \"No fair observer, weighing those two decisions against the overall record, could conclude that this government was anti-mining,\" Mr Griffiths said. The battle over Coronation Hill showed how bitter prob- lems of land access could become when the interests of conservationists, aboriginals, miners and the wider commu- nity were in conflict, he said. However, Mr Campbell Anderson, chairman of the Australian Mining Industry Council, repeated warnings by industry leaders that the Coro- nation Hill and Jabiluka decisions could lead to an out- flow of exploration dollars. \"We expect a sensible approach to land access for exploration and development, an approach which protects that which should be protected while properly managing development in areas of lesser worth,\" he said. Meanwhile, aboriginal oppo- sition to plans by Dominion Mining for a A$350m nickel project at Yackabindie in West- ern Australia was strength- ened by the intervention of the Mutitjulu tribe at Ayers Rock, more than 1,000 km (600 miles) away in the Northern Terri- tory. The federal government has said it will not interfere with the proposed mine, which has approval from the Western Australian state government. However, tribal leaders said mining would disturb the car- pet snake, a spiritual symbol of the Mutitjulu, which they believe passed through Yacka. bindie during the Dreamtime, the Aboriginal creation myth."

   "text_content" : "LITTLE PROGRESS was made towards a new international cocoa agreement at the Inter- national Cocoa Organisation talks in London last week. Even a possible solution to the problem of the $152m debt to the organisation's buffer stock appeared to run into trouble almost immediately, writes David Blackwell. Producers had proposed to repay 7 per cent of the debt is stages up until the end ol September next year, when the current agreement, which is purely administrative, runs out. This proved, however, to be unacceptable to consuming countries. Not enough delegates had a mandate for discussing a fur. ther proposal that 10 per cent of arrears should be repaid over the coming year, with the system continuing through the period of a new agreement until the debt was cleared. The council will reconvene to con- ) sider this proposal on Novem- I ber 13 to 15. However, Brazil, which is i the second biggest producer after the Ivory Coast and owes S$25m of the debt, said after the I talks ended on Friday that it might still not be in a position to begin repayments in Novem- ber. The November meeting will include the preparatory working group which is looking at the future of the cocoa agreement. Most pro- ducer countries believe the future of the cocoa agreement lies with export quotas and a buffer stock.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Ireland Cracks down on Growth Hormone",
   "text_content" : "By Tin Coon. in Dublin A LARGE seizure of \"angel dust\" and other farm animal growth hormones has been made by the Irish authorities in what appears to have been their biggest crackdown yet against the trafficking of these banned substances. According to a department of agriculture official in Dublin \"several van-loads\" of a \"cock. tail\" of banned veterinary products were seized in a raid by police and agriculture department officials late last Friday at a business premises in the county town of Kildare. Although no precise figures have yet been given, the haul is thought to have a potential farm-gate value of tens of mil- lions of pounds. One kilogram can cost up to I140,000 on the black market. Supplies into Ireland were previously thought to have come from the US or France, but Friday's raid followed a tip-off from the Dutch police force, which had raided a phar- maceuticals plant, Dopharma, in the Netherlands two weeks ago where they discovered \"angel dust\" was being me- gally manufactured. Dutch police are reported to have claimed that they had dealt a major blow to the \"angel dust\" black market throughout Europe. Clenbuterol, the chemical name of \"angel dust\", has become the miracle drug for farmers in the beef industry who are facing steadily lower prices as the EC seeks to reduce its beef \"mountain\". A few grams of the substance injected or fed to a fattening animal rapidly converts body fat into meat, bringing price premiums to the grower with no extra outlay on food costs. Meat quality, however, is con- siderably reduced, and it is thought that farmers selling meat into EC intervention stocks rather than to the fresh market have been the ones most tempted to utilise the drugs on their livestock, despite facing heavy fines if they are caught. About 230,000 tonnes of Ireland's total beef exports of 365,000 tonnes were sold into intervention last vnar .--",

   "article_dc_title" : "West German Farmers Go Back to Their Roots",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "WX HILE WORKERS from the former East W Germany flood across the old border in search of jobs in the west, farmers are head- ing in droves in the opposite direction. Some hope to reclaim land and property confiscated by the communists in the late 1940s. Others see the 1.9m hect- ares (4.75m acres) over which ownership is in dispute as a golden opportunity to expand their businesses. Furthermore, eastern Ger- many, with its large fields and the even larger blocks of land previously run by co-operatives or the state, offers them the chance to cash in on economies of a scale denied them in the west of the country. Half a century ago, much of Germany was composed of large estates with many tenant farmers running a few hectares each. This was particularly true in the east. When communist rule was imposed there the farms were amalgamated and most of the barriers between fields and farms were removed. The result was great expanses of land often stretching to several hundred hectares and ideally suited to high horse-power machines. In the west, meanwhile, there have also been changes in the structure of the farming. In contrast to the east, how- ever, capitalism dictated the demise of the smallest farmers in favour of a greater number of owner-occupiers on medium- sized holdings, together with the growth of part-time farming. Conservative instincts have also meant that traditional small fields - often in strips across the countryside, owned and farmed by different people - still survive. So, eastern Germany holds obvious attractions for farmers in the west. But there remains the matter of the people who have worked and lived on the land for the last 50 years. Legal arguments about title to land will inevitably continue for some time. The job of adju- dicating over them falls to the Treuhand in Berlin, the gov- ernment body that is attempt- ing to sort out the mass of property issues following reunification. In the meantime, however, west German farmers are already making their presence felt in the east. Many are act- ing as advisers to existing co- operatives while others are already in place and farming successfully. Where this has happened, yields of cereals, for instance, are reported to have been significantly higher in the harvest just past than the year Cattle graze In F of a redunldant rontler post before. The average improve- ment is estimated at about 8 per cent, while increases of 30 per cent over last year have been claimed. This has generated a sense of excitement among west Ger- man farmers with eastern intentions. Over the weekend I visited two such individuals on their west German farms. The family of Mr Jurgen Rimpau, a tenant on 300 hect- ares in Lower Saxony, was evicted from a large farm near Magdeburg, in eastern Ger- many. Before the war, his father was one of Germany's major cereal seed-breeders and the property they had to leave FARMER'S VIEWPOINT By David Richardson included three castles. Mr Rimpau, who was a baby in the 1940s, clearly has strong emotional ties to the land, quite apart from his wish to expand his farming, and he is desperate to get at least some of it back. It appears, however, that the best he can hope for and afford is that a consortium of three other previous land- owners from the area and him- self may be able to rent 2,500 hectares on an 18-year lease with an option to buy at any time during the period. He expects that it will take the Treuhand some time to authorise this and the earliest he expects to be able to farm the land is next autumn. In the meantime, he is visiting the farm twice a week to get to know the soil and the people who work it. In the past, the farm in question employed 490 people. Half of them have already left for jobs in the west. The rest remain but when Mr Rimpau and his col- leagues take over they expect to employ no more than 20 to 25. The social problems that will be faced by this one commu- nity are clearly immense and there are no easy answers. Meanwhile, Mr Rimpau is agonising over whether to move from his comfortable house near Einbeck back to his ancestral home. Mr Philip von dem Bussche, on the other hand, has no intention of moving east from his 700-hectare family estate near Bad Essen. Even before reunification he became a con- sultant to a 2,200-hectare estate near Leipzig. When the Berlin Wall came down, this led to an invitation from the managers of the farm for him to become a partner with them in modernising the management. He accepted and is now part of the team but his involvement did not include investment. Here, too, there were labour problems. In the past, the estate had employed 120 peo- ple. Now it needs only 10 and Mr von dem Bussche claims the farm looks better and is producing much more than it did previously. The redundant workers, however, have been employed by an international parcel ser- vice which Mr von dem Bussche was able to attract to the village. Clearly this is an ideal solu- tion to a considerable social problem. But, as Mr von dem Bussche explained, it is virtu- ally unique. Production from eastern Ger- man farms, however, seems set to soar over the next few years as western techniques and management methods are widely introduced. That, in turn, will exacerbate the already-intractable problem of EC surpluses. But at present, as they head west in search of big blocks of land, that prob. lem is very low on west Ger- man farmers' list of priorities.",

France's consumer price Index rose between 0.2 and 03 per cent in August, bringing the year-on-year inflation rate down to 3.0 from 8.4 per cent. Annualised Frech inflation in Auigust was well below the German rate of 4.1 per cent, but demand for the D-Mark on interest rate differentials means that the franc may sus- ser If French rates are cut.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street A DULL day on Wall Street saw shares trading in a nar- rowly mixed range for most of the time before turning higher in the late afternoon, writes Karen Zagor in New York. A late spurt of buying helped the Dow Jones Industrial Aver- age climb above the 3,000 level, to close 29.52 higher at 3015.21 on volume of 172.6m shares. The broadly-based Standard & Poors 500 was also higher, adding 2.15 to 385.74 at the close, and advancing issues on the big board gained an increasing edge on those declining by the end of the day, 911 to 704. Secondary issues trailed big board issues throughout the day. In late trading, the Nas- daq composite was 1.03 lower at 515.68, while the American Exchange composite was off 0.47 at 366.87. On Friday, the Dow lost 22.14 to close at 2,985.69. With Wall Street no longer waiting for a cut in interest rates, corporate news was once more the dominant force behind stock price movements. Beazer led the trading on the New York Stock Exchange, climbing $2% to $8% after the UK's Hanson said it would make a cash and warrant offer of Â£350m for the company. PepsiCo slid $% to $29'%. on U news tbat the company will take a $loOm pre-tax charge - third quarter to cover job cuts t and reorganisation at its Frito Lay operations. f Nike jumped $3% to $51% r after turning in surprisingly s strong first quarter earnings. Although the athletic shoe I maker expects a weaker second *% quarter, profits are expected to I, rebound in the second half. 1 The projections helped i. shares in other sports shoe k makers. LA. Gear added $% to $12% and Reebok rose $2 to e $32%. a The sell-off in Salomon was a revived yesterday morning, e with the stock losing $% to e $24%, but the losses were later recouped and the shares closed g unchanged on the day. The e scandal-ridden brokerage i- house is negotiating a new r multi-billion dollar loan to i replace some of its commercial f paper borrowings. e Among actively-traded blue t chip issues, IBM rose $% to $103% and Philip Morris added r $% to $72%. t TCBY Enterprises dropped a $% to $7 after slashing its divi- a dend to 5 cents from 10 cents i. and reporting third quarter e earnings of 18 cents a share , against 25 cents a year ago. Northrop slipped $% to $22 i on reports that Congress will r probably freeze future orders of the company's B-2 bomber. 1 High-tech stocks led the sec- ondary market yesterday morning. Intel fell $1%. to $42%'/, Lotus Development lost $1 to $80% and Sun Microsys- tems eased $% to $29%. Biotech issues were also actively traded, with Amgen rising $% to $56 and Centocorp firming $% to $52%. First National Pennsylvania Jumped $2% to $27% on news that it had entered a merger agreement with PNC Financial whereby each First National share will be exchanged for 0.81 of a PNC share.

   "text_content" : "By Greg Hutchinson in Manil THE PHILIPPINE stock market fell ahead of the formal vote late last night by the country's senate in favour of ending the almost century-long US mili- tary presence. The fall was limited, how- ever, by reports that President Corazon Aquino would push for a referendum in an attempt to nullify the senate vote. The senate rejected, by 12 votes to 11, a treaty to extend the Americans' stay, following the expiry of a 25-year agreement yesterday. A two-thirds major- ity would have been necessary to pass the treaty. Yesterday, the Manila com- posite index fell 12.88 or 1.4 per cent to 905.70 and the Makati composite shed 11.93 or 1.3 per cent to 915.58. \"We didn't see a big drop, as the market had pretty much discounted a no vote,\" said Mr George Lichauco of stockbrokers Anscor Hage- Philippines Manila Composite Index 1,05( 1,00( 95( 90( 85( Sowur: Daatrman dorn. Combined turnover on the twin exchanges eased to 110m pesos from Friday's 145m. Since it became clear two weeks ago that the senate was likely to reject the treaty, the Manila and Makati exchanges have lost 11 per cent of their value. Much of the selling has been foreign, and the stocks worst hit have been the main blue chips. Manila has dropped 23.5 per cent from its 1991 high of 1,183.40 reached at the end of May, just before the eruption in June of Mount Pinatubo. Brokers said that, if the US were to pull out swiftly, the market could lose a further 15 to 20 per cent in the next three months. There were signs yesterday that the US could delay its decision to leave its former col- ony. Mr Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the US embassy in Manila, said Washington supported Mrs Aquino's efforts to have the issue put to a national referendum. Lawyers, however, warned that such a referendum might be prohib- ited by the constitution.",

   "text_content" : "THE ABSENCE of a lead from Japan yesterday kept most Pacific Rim markets quiet and cautious. The Tokyo stock market was closed for a national holiday. AUSTRALIA fell sharply after Wall Street's retreat on Friday. The All Ordinaries index lost 10.7 to 1,557.1, while the All Resources index shed 7.2 to 913.4 as a stronger Aus- tralian dollar put pressure on the sector. Turnover declined to A$166m from A$252m. Rights issue news weighed on some stocks. Pacific Dunlop slipped 4 cents to A$5.18 after the diversified manufacturing group announced a one-for-five rights offer at A$4.30 a share to raise A$673m. Faulding, the pharmaceuti- cals company, weakened 14 cents initially after announc- ing a one-for-five rights issue at A$3.50 a share to raise A$54m. However, the stock later recovered to close unchanged on balance at A$5. NEW ZEALAND was pulled lower by another fall in Fletcher Challenge, which lost 6 cents to NZ$3.43 after last week's downgrading of profits forecasts by analysts. The NZSE-40 index shed 3.63 to 1,408.77 in active turnover of NZ$22m, down from NZ$24m. SINGAPORE declined in light volume, with the Straits Times Industrial index losing 11.02 to 1,404.67. About 26m shares changed hands, down from Friday's 81m, which had included a placement of 56m Singapore Land shares. Scotts Holdings was the most active stock as it made its debut, closing at S$1.05 after an offer price of S$1.25. HONG KONG also eased in quiet trading, as the weekend's elections failed to stir the mar- ket. The Hang Seng index retreated 20.59 to 3,953.53 in turnover of HK$1.09bn, after Friday's HK$1.OSbn. TAIWAN picked up on bar- gain hunting, but turnover fell to its lowest level for eight months. The weighted index gained 31.73 to 4,565.99 in trad- ing worth T$9.5bn, down from Saturday's T$9.9bn and the worst figure since T$9.2bn on January 15 near the start of the Gulf war. KUALA LUMPUR extended last week's losses, the compos- ite index slipping 3.12 to 541.34 in volume of 26.7m shares. SEOUL fell on profit-taking. The composite index, up 7.86 on Saturday, shed 3.37 to 685.34 in turnover of Wonl87bn. BOMBAY reached another all-time high. The BSE index leapt 50.61 or 2.7 per cent to 1,912.35. Rumours that the rupee might be devalued boosted export-related stocks. JAKARTA lost ground on growing concern about the economy. The index receded 7.2 or 2.4 per cent to 288.09 on turnover of 5.03m shares.",

CWrppil. The FinaNdd cl LemUud.Q Goldmn. ech Cerd C ~= NtWlt Sesale By Antonia Sharpe AN ADVANCE in Tokyo last Friday offset weak- ness on Wall Street and ensured a steady world perfor- mance in a week dominated by interest rate movements. According to the FT-Actu- aries indices, the world index fell by 0.3 per cent in local cur- rency terms, although exclu- ding the US it would have risen by 0.3 per cent. Without Japan, the world index would have fallen by 1.1 per cent. Japan finished the week 1.4 per cent higher as a rise on Friday, on hopes of lower inter- est rates, reversed an easier start to the week. Friday's advance was made all the more convincing by the leap in vol. ume to 1.2bn shares, the first time above the lbn level since February and almost triple Thursday's 430m shares. Nomura International in London is optimistic about the stock market's short-term out- look. \"The recent strength of the bond market and the sub- sequent easing of short-term rates should encourage some funds to be switched out of money market instruments into equities,\" the broker writes in its weekly. review. It also points out that the stock market to date has failed to match the rally on the bond market and could quickly cor- rect this anomaly. However, the arrival of the long-awaited cut in US interest rates on Friday failed to give Wall Street the support it needed to keep the Dow Jones index above the important 3,000 level. On the FT-A indi- ces, the US fell 1.5 per cent on the week, on worries about the outlook for third quarter corpo- rate results. Swiss Bank Corporation says the main risk for European equities is again coming from the US. The broker argues that, if investors find US bonds relatively unattractive, this could lead first to dollar weak- ness and then to rising bond yields. A weak dollar would make Europe's \"dollar earners\" less buoyant, while setbacks in US bonds would hardly be seen as positive news, especially if fears over the growth scene for 1992 are exacerbated. Scandinavia provided the week's best and worst perform- ers. Sweden climbed 3.2 per cent, boosted by favourable inflation data and hopes that last Sunday's general election would be won by the opposi- tion conservative parties. The market, however, declined slightly yesterday after the centre-right coalition failed to win a clear majority. Ms Talna UIas, country ana. lyst at Kleinwort Benson, attri- butes Finland's 8.5 per cent drop last week to devaluation fears, which have pushed three-month money market rates to more than 13 per cent from a level of 10.5 per cent only two weeks ago. Investors are unwilling to return to the stock market until there are signs of prog- ress in the current wage talks and the budget negotiations in parliament. Ms Ulas believes that confi- dence on the Finnish bourse would get a much-needed boost if the opposition parties were to support the government's proposed budget, which calls for about FMlObn worth of savings. \"If the opposition par- ties agree to the spending cuts, this will be a positive sign,\" she says.",

   "text_content" : "-AT --_-- PARIS WAS enlivened by news and speculation about govern- ment plans for tax and privati- sation, but it ended below the day's high on Wall Street's dull start. Stockholm was disap- pointed by election results while other bourses were flat, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was unable to hold on to early gains, as the CAC 40 index fell from 1,887.66 to close at 1,878.26, up 2.07. Turnover was moderate at FFr2bn, down from FFr3.7bn. News of govern- ment plans to cut corporation tax had been expected, said one dealer, but reports of an increase in capital gains tax produced some wariness. Speculation that Pechiney International could be the first state-controlled company to be partially privatised pushed it up FFr13.50 or 8.1 per cent to FFr181 in volume of 319,400 shares, after a report in les Echos, the business newspaper. Investment certificates in Rh6ne-Poulenc, another candi- date, rose FFr10.30 to FFr433.30 with 108,900 exchanged. Some blue chips fell prey to profit-taking before the end of the trading account this week, while others attracted demand after recent weakness. Accor, the hotels group, gained FFr15 to FFr820. Department stores remained volatile. BHV, owned by Nou- velles Galeries, rose FFr22 or 3 per cent to FFr762 on expecta- tions of good interim results. Galeries Lafayette, which con- trols Nouvelles Galeries, rose FFr47 or 3 per cent to FFr1,637. STOCKHOLM was disap- pointed that the opposition centre-right coalition had failed to gain an expected majority in Sunday's general election. The AffirsvArlden General index fell 8.50 to 1,081.0 in turnover of SKr311m, down from SKr523m. Skandia free shares rose SKr5 to SKrl98 after the bourse said that two block trades equalling 2.6 per cent of the share capital had changed hands at SKr200 a share. But the stock later closed at SKrl89, down SKr4. There has A ,s been speculation recently that 1- SE-Banken will not exercise its 1- option to buy 28 per cent of e Skandia at an indexed price 11 that analysts estimate has - reached SKr245 a share. Skan- :s dia has expressed its opposi- t, tion to SE-Banken's advances. FRANKFURT failed to n respond to general or specific 10 stimuli. There was little reac- e tion when the Frankfurt Tr bourse insider trading commis- n sion cleared three Deutsche i- Bank securities officials and a n television journalist from d insider trading suspicions. n After an 0.80 decline to 677.30 x in the FAZ index in midses- sion, the DAX closed 7.87 lower y at 1,629.75 in turnover down it from DM4.3bn to DM3.5bn. e In insurers, AMB fell DM20 it to DM825. AGF, the French o insurer, recently confirmed 0 that it had acquired a 15 per s cent stake in AMB over the r. past 18 months.

   "text_content" : "By Terrv Bvland. UK Stock Market Editor FRESH indications from both the corporate and economic fronts that economic recovery could prove slower than antici- pated depressed the UK stock market yesterday. The FT-SE Index fell by nearly 20 points to within six points of the 2,600 level, widely regarded as the lower end of the current trad- i ing range. London steadied in late trading as Wall Street appeared to brace itself for a fresh run at the Dow 3,000 mark early in the new session. Equity trading volume was boosted by heavy activity in Racal stocks as the new Voda- sone shares began trading for the first time. The newly demerged Racal Electronics dominated the market with 168m shares traded; the total was swollen by double count- ing as share blocks moved Amound Delli Daft 8:p Sp 16 Sep 30 8p 12 s 28 Oct 10 between brokers, marketmak- ers and the Inter Dealer Broker network which operates only between marketmaking firms. The day's highlight was the surprise Â£351.4m bid from Han- son for Beazer, the UK con- struction group which is in the process of shifting domicile to the US. The bid was two-edged as far as the market was con- cerned; Beazer shares returned from early suspension to rise strongly, but ICI stock fell heavily as traders took the' view that Hanson is now less likely to make an all-out bid for the UK's premier chemical company. With Tokyo on holiday and Wall Street lower on Friday, UK equities opened about 12 Footsie points down as traders reacted cautiously to the lat- est public opinion poll indica- tions of increasing support for Mr John Major's Conservative government. The opinion poll readings revived the possibility of a general election being held in the UK in November, thus increasing market uncertainty. However, nearly nine points of the early decline in equities were accounted for by down- ward ex-dividend adjustments in several leading components of the FT-SE 100-share Index. e The nmarket rallied, in spite a of poor trading news from Rat- a ners, the UK ewellery group, I but was turned sharply down- wards again by the unexpected i news that UK retail saes had r, fallen by 1.4 per cent in 2 August. a The retail sales statistics I- were quickly followed by the i- disclosure that UK industrial r production had risen by 0.8 per e cent in July and that unit labour costs had gained 8.8 per s cent in the quarter to the same a month. a By the end of the day the s FT-SE Index was 19.8 down at r. 2,606.0. Seaq volume, incorpo- if rating the excitement in the a Racal stocks, in Beazer and a I- placing of stock in Royal, the s UK composite insurance group, s totalled 641.3m shares, com- pared with 626.7m on Friday. e Traders maintained that yes - terday's setback e as no more i, than a temporary adjustmeni i in a market stil fundamentall i confident.

   "text_content" : "A SUBSTANTIAL block of stock in Royal Insurance, the UK composite insurer, was placed last night, too late to be registered on the day's Seaq reporting list; the deal is expec- ted to appear this morning on the Seaq list of overnight deals. Stockbroker Robert Fleming Securities carried out an agency cross of 22m shares, apparently on behalf of a large UK institution, at 365p a share and placed them with UK and international funds. The agency cross, with dou- ble counting of the shares bought and sold by Fleming, represents a 4.5 per cent stake in the company. Royal shares, badly affected last week by what was described as a bear raid, rallied 5 to 375p yesterday on reported turnover of 1.7m. Mr Nicholas Dobby at Flem- ing said the broker carried out the trades after meeting the insurance group. The broker believed last week's raid, prompted by dividend and rights issue stories, was unjus- tified. \"If Royals did not launch a rights issue when the sol- vency margin was around 32 per cent, as it was at the com- pany's year-end, then it is hardly likely to do so when the margin is around 40 per cent,\" said Mr Dobby. He reiterated the broker's positive stance on the shares. Racal activity Massive two-way turnover developed in Racal Electronics, after the official demerger of the Vodafone cellular radio business, with the market full of stories that a stakebuilder had been at work in the mar- ket. Thorn EMI, GEC, and Ingersoll of the US, were put forward as potential bidders for Racal Electronics, and turn- over in the stock accounted for around a quarter of market volume. Some 168m Racal shares were traded. They ended the day at 51p, with two leading investment houses, S.G. War- burg Securities and BZW, said to have been heavy buyers. Many dealers expect a sub- stantial stake in Racal to be announced within 24 hours. Mr Brian Newman, electronics specialist at Henderson Cros- thwaite, said: \"We believe there is a corporate entity buy- ing via the inter-dealer broker network in order to disguise their presence in the market.\" At the close Racal Electron- ics were quoted at 51p, with Vodafone, newly installed in the Footsie, 15 higher at 347p on 13m traded. Thorn EMI relinquished 12 to 802p. Beazer bid Trading in Beazer was suspended before the opening of business but resumed later in the session after an agreed Â£351.4m bid from Hanson. Bea- zer shares, quoted at 83p at Fri- day's close, resumed at 116p xd and closed at 115%'/p xd, up 34. Beazer was in the process of selling off its CHB UK house- building division, expected to raise around Â£450m. Observers said the market would be pleased with the terms of the deal. \"It suggests that the banks were unhappy with developments even after what was expected to have been a highly successful sell-off of CHB,\" said one. Hanson's bid for Beazer unsettled ICI shares, which have been supported in recent months by hopes of a takeover offer from 2.7 per cent stake- holder Hanson. ICI dropped 45 at one point before steadying to close a net 37 down at 1267p. Turnover came to 3m, the busi- est day's trade in the stock for a month. Before Hanson announced its stake ICI shares stood at Â£11. Hanson firmed % to 214%p as 29m shares changed hands, the heaviest day's trade in the stock this year. Hanson war- rants slipped 4'/ to 29p, having bottomed at 26%p. Hanson is issuing more warrants as part of the takeover of Beazer. US buying of Reuters exacer- bated a shortage of stock already apparent last week. The shares bucked the market trend with a gain of 10 to 916p. Shell Transport closed 9 lower at 512p xd after Strauss Turnbull, the broking house, told clients that Shell may be on the brink of a dividend freeze for 1992 and 1993. Strauss believes Shell's payout ratio is too high and that it plans a large capital expendi- ture programme over the next five years over which gearing may rise to 25 per cent. AB Ports rose 22 to 377p xd as a number of brokers became extremely positive following its interim results last week. For example, County NatWest advised its clients to buy aggressively, saying that the shares should be valued at over 500p. Tibbet & Britten, the transport and distribution ser- vices group, added 4 at 500p after half-time profits increased to Â£6.3m from Â£5.4m. British Airways eased 3 to 185p following renewed specu- lation in the press about a price war on transatlantic routes. British Steel bucked the trend, gaining 2 to 125%p. Turnover reached 7.9m, with a large part of the day's activity linked to active buying of calls in the options market. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith New Court believes there are signs that the environment and steel mar- kets have potential for change soon. Torday & Carlisle jumped 26 to 90p after Dowding & Mills, a penny down at 60p, launched a Â£13.6m hostile bid for the engi- neering group. British Aerospace continued to languish, giving up a further 2 to 414p. However, dealers noted scrappy buying around the 410p mark. Ransomes fell 7 to 49p after reporting a slump in interim profits. Ladbroke and Granada out- performed the market as S.G. Warburg published a note rec- ommending that investors switch out of UK-oriented hotel groups, such as Forte and FT-A AIIShare Index 1300 1250 1200 1150 Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Excluding: Inta-maikat business Overseas turnover 600 400 200 0 Queen's Moat Houses, and into other large leisure stocks. War- burg said the UK hotels sector would be slow to recover. Ladbroke climbed 4% to 283p, while Granada held at 173p. Forte slipped a penny to 279p and Queen's Moat edged a penny lower to 279p. There was no stopping the holiday sector. Airtours advanced 14 to 683p and Air- break rose 2%/ to 38p. Akibreak began trading on the USM on August 22. Ratners disappointed the market with an interim loss of Â£17.7m compared with a profit of Â£9.3m in the same period last year. The shares retreated 7 to 129p as analysts lowered their full-year estimates to around Â£65m to Â£75m from Â£80m to Â£100m. Dixons receded 6 to 266p as Mr Stanley Kalms, the chair- man, announced that he had sold Im shares at 269p. Marks and Spencer eased 4%'/ to 282p after the 1.4 per cent fall in August retail sales. Brown and Jackson, the retailer, closed 4 down at 8p, having dropped to as low as 6'/sp at one stage on worries that current trading difficulties may have forced it into a refi- nancing package. The company later issued a statement that it knew of no change in its trad- ing position which would explain this movement. Property issues provided a bright area in an otherwise lacklustre market, with advances of several pence recorded in the leaders and second-line stocks. Analysts said the sector had been among the worst in the market since the start of the year - at the lowest for more than 20 years relative to the market, said one. In addition, asset values were bottoming out and companies now had lit- tle or no capital gains tax lia- bilities. Sentiment was helped by trebled interim profits from Asda Property, up 3 at 85p. A raised dividend and posi- tive chairman's statement prompted footwear manufac- turer FII, which announced full-year results yesterday, to gain 4 to 388p. Inchcape was one of the strongest Footsie stocks yester- day. It rose 10 to 402p after posting interim profits of Â£91.3m, only slightly down on last year. Analysts said the results were better than the range of estimates and the chairman's statement was cau- tiously optimistic. Trafalgar House responded to weekend press speculation that it might be the target for a BTR bid. While most analysts were dismissive the shares put on 5 to 237p. BTR lost a penny to 426p xd. MB-Caradon, also mentioned as a possible target, firmed 5 to 255p. Morgan Crucible's share price held at 267p against a falling market after the com- pany produced interim profits in line with expectations and an optimistic statement.

   "text_content" : "11 TT TIl lm I After several years of ^ I.l^L exuberanUL ruwuth, sales of personal computers are slowing. Now the PC market is looking for regeneration. Multimedia may provide the spark. Alan Cane reviews progress in the evolution of today's single most influential business technology ONE event above all others brought some colour into what has been a grey year for the personal computer business: Apple Computer, the founder of the modern PC industry, and International Business Machines, the world leader in PCs, agreed to collaborate in business and technology. The surprise could not have been greater if David and Goli- ath had agreed to work together to research and develop the slingshot market. In the 10 years IBM has been in the PC business, the two companies have been bitter rivals. Their approaches to per- sonal computing have been directly opposed. IBM has made its machines the busi- ness standard, offering PCs suited to commercial data pro- cessing. The idiosyncrastic Apple Macintosh machine, on the other hand, with its \"wimp\" (windows, icons, mice, pull down menus) interface,was designed for easy use by non- specialists. Now they are joining hands to attempt to define the future of personal computing. The agreement covers four areas: joint creation of a new, object- orientated operating system, shoehorning IBM's high-speed rise microprocessors into Apple PCs, helping Apple to sell its PCs in IBM accounts, and setting jointly a global standard for multimedia com- puting. Further details of the new alliance are vague. The distin- guished US commentator Stew- art Alsop noted in a recent issue of his newsletter*: \"It may well be that what is left unsaid is left that way because the new partners have no idea themselves about what they are trying to accomplish. The result is that it is almost impossible to say anything intelligent about the impact of the deal on either company or the industry.\" But what the \"Purple Alli- ance\", as Alsop calls it, has done is to place a spotlight on some important trends in the industry. * The threats to established players from an explosion of new technologies at a time of stagnant sales; * The blurring of the line between PCs and midrange computers; * The importance of object-ori- ented software techniques; * The emergence of multime- dia as a potential source of new growth in the industry. First, the state of the indus- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t try. Times are tough in the PC business. The recession in the US, UK and other parts of the developed world has knocked much of the stuffing out of an industry hitherto noted for its ability to maintain rates of growth ambitious by any stan- diard. Even Compaq, the US manu- facturer of high performance PCs, found its previously unchecked growth curve turn- ing down this year. Apple Com- puter's results suffered from its decision to sell lower mar- gin products than in the past. The result is that the US mar- ket, the dynamo for growth in earlier years, is flat. IDC, the market research consultancy, estimates the US PC market will grow only 0.3 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent in 1992. Europe is little better, with the UK the blackest spot, while Germany still enjoys some- thing of a boom. Price cutting is rampant. Dell Computer, one of the most innovative of the new suppli- ers, recently cut its alread: low prices by up to a quarter, The price of a Dell notebook computer, for example, weni down from Â£2,349 to Â£1,799. The recession is to some extent masking much mor fundamental changes in the PC business. There are signs the market is becoming saturated Estimates are that within two to three years, replacemeni machines will represent 70 pe cent of sales compared tc about 40 per cent at present. There are also signs thai business customers are becom. ing disappointed with the results of investment in PCs. The machines have improved massively in power, with suc cessive generations of proces sor chips, but software to take advantage of the new powei has been slow in emerging. Both Apple and IBM face fierce threats from competitors offering lookalike technologies. Apple, for example, this yeaz faced the greatest threat to its proprietary Macintosh technol. ogy through the launch of spe- cial systems software from Microsoft called Windows 3 which duplicates much of the look and feel of Apple's graphi- cal interface. Windows 3 has been hugely successful, partly due to Microsoft's decision to sell it at under Â£100 to capture market share. Apple came back with a new and more powerful version of its own operating system, Sys- tem 7. For the moment, how- ever, Apple's position in its key markets, especially desktop publishing, seems secure through the quality and com- prehensiveness of its software support - \"the best set of per- sonal productivity applications in existence\", as one commen- tator put it. Operating systems, however, remain a source of controversy in the industry. This year there was a considerable cooling in the relationship between IBM and Microsoft, which supplies both its DOS and OS/2 PC oper- atin srastems. The anparent cause was Microsoft's wish to concentrate its efforts on its operating system DOS version 5 coupled with Windows 3, rather than OS/2. For the moment, anyway. Industry experts agree that the combination of Intel micropro- cessors and Microsoft operat- ing systems, which have char acterised the industry to date, is coming to an end. The line between PCs, work- stations and midrange comput- ers is becoming blurred. Net- works of PCs are encroaching on territories occupied by mini- computers and small main- frames. Palm top computers of the kind developed by Poquet and Hewlett Packard of the US and Psion of the UK, and note- book computers, may well emerge as the \"personal\" com- puters of the future. Desktop machines will be linked together in networks, driven by powerful network \"servers\" - suppliers of data or computational power. A variety of operating systems will be available, including Microsoft's new Win- dows NT, Sun Microsystem's Solaris, the new development from IBM and Apple, and developments of Unix from the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). The aim will be to tie PCs and more powerful machines together in seamless networks. - None of this suggests that customers will find it any easier to make decisions either about technology or about product strategies. Increas- ingly they will be dependent on the \"channel\" - the deal- ers, retailers, value added resellers and software houses responsible for distributing some 80-90 per cent of PCs to customers. Channel differentia- tion is already apparent. Com- paq will this year for the first time ask for a high level of expertise from dealers selling certain products. The fact remains that com- puter users and the PC indus- try itself are waiting for a breakthrough in software to generate fresh sales and new excitement in a stagnant industry. The original Visicalc spreadsheet is credited with popularising the Apple II, Lotus 1-2-3 with the success of the IBM PC. What will create mass mar- kets for the hugely powerful PCs of the middle 1990s? Hopes for artificial intelligence were dashed when expert systems, a way of combining computer power and human expertise in an automated assistant, found only niche markets in commer- cial companies. Much is being made at pres- ent of multimedia, the combi- nation of sound, video, text, graphics, animation and com- puter power on a PC coupled with facility for the operator to interact with the information contained on the system. Multimedia has the capacity to generate new PC markets, but it has hurdles of cost, stan- dards, education and technol- ogy to overcome before it becomes a genuine contender for the role of the Lotus 1-2-3 of the 1990s. *PC Letter, Industry Publishing Company Inc, 301 Island Park- way, Belmont, California, tel 415-592 8880.

   "text_content" : "\"DEAD in the. water!\" is the way John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer, recently described the US PC market. Sales are stagnant, prices are tumbling and the future is clouded with uncertainties. The recession that has gripped the US economy for the past year has taken its toll throughout the computer busi- ness, -but the PC sector has been particularly hard hit. The double digit sales growth of past years has come to a grind- ing halt. In efforts to boost demand and build market share, lead- ing PC manufacturers, includ- ing IBM, Apple Computer and Compaq Computer, have slashed prices by as much as 40 per cent. Competitors, how- ever, have followed suit, creat- ing a \"price war\" that has pared profits throughout the industry. While the economy has played its part in the slow- down, turmoil in the distribu- tion channel - the dealers and resellers who deliver most PCs to end users - is making mat- ters much worse. In the past few months, eight of the top PC distributors in the US have been involved in mergers or acquisitions. ComputerLand bought Nynex Business Cen- ters, CompuCom purchased Computer Factory, and Ina- comp Computers announced it will merge with Valcom to form InaCom. Last month, JWP, a New York technical-services com- pany that has built a big PC business through acquisitions, completed its purchase of Busi- nessland, once the largest PC distributor in the country but recently plagued with heavy losses. Businessland's problems illustrate those of the industry. Founded in 1982, Businessland rapidly built up a nationwide chain of computer stores, win- ning purchase contracts from businesses to which it offered training and support services as well as hardware and soft- ware. Over recent years, however, many large corporate custom- ers have shifted their pur- chases to no-frills dealers such as JWP, while smaller busi- nesses and individuals increas- ingly buy from discount \"super- stores\". Other custom- ers bought directly from manu- facturers such as Dell Com- puter that sell by mail order. The standard PC has become a \"commodity\" product and price has become the primary differentiating factor. Busines- The standard PC has become a \"commodity\"; price has become the differentiating factor sland, and several other com- puter chains, failed to adapt to changing market conditions quickly enough. PC manufacturers heavily dependent on independent dealers have been seriously affected by the wave of consoli- dation. As dealers combine their. existing stocks, they are delaying new orders. Compaq Computer's latest financial results provide stark evidence of the impact of vola- tility in the distribution chan- nel; it reported the. poorest quarterly results in the com- pany's history, with earnings down 81 per cent at $20.3m and sales down 17 per cent at $718m for its second quarter. The company's US revenues dropped 36 per cent compared with the same period last year. Compaq was hardly alone in reporting dismal results this summer. Apple Computer lost $53.1m in its third quarter ended June 30, after writing off the $224m cost of restructuring operations to prepare for slower growth. Apple's sales rose 12 per cent to $l.52m. Industry analysts say that it may be well into next year before US PC makers' financial results begin to improve. While the current problems of excess inventory in the US distribu- tion channel may be short- lived, and the economy eventu- ally improve, there is an under- lying weakness in the market. The US market for desktop personal computers is matur- ing. More than half of the machines sold to businesses over the past year have been used to replace older models, but corporate buyers are increasingly sceptical about i- the advantages of the latest o higher performance, higher- s priced PCs. The education market, once y the stronghold of Apple Com- ,t puter, is increasingly frag- y mented and has suffered as a - consequence of school budget e cuts. e The growth of PC sales has slowed in each of the last three t years - from 34 per cent in k 1988 to 10 per cent last year, when US sales reached $23.7bn, according to Dataquest. t It predicts unit sales of PCs L- will decline an average 6.9 per s cent a year through to 1995. A An exception to this decline t is the lightweight \"notebook\" computer. Many observers pre- a dict white-hot growth for note- I books for the next few years. Analysts at Hambrecht & a Quist, the San Francisco investment banking group, t expect 1991 sales to top im units, with the notebook mar- i ket maintaining 50 per cent g annual growth. BIS Strategic Decisions of Massachusetts projects that notebook com- puter sales will rise to $4.7bn by 1995. Most notebook computers are bought by individuals who are already regular users of desktop computers. But the big challenge for the industry is to create products that will attract new computer users. By blending computer and video technology, computer makers hope to breath new life into the home computer market, which has been in the doldrums for the past four years. One of the most promising developments is the \"pen- based\" computer, in which the keyboard is replaced by a tab- let upon which the user can write. This emerging product is expected to blossom into a 1.5m unit market by the mid. 1990s. The industry is also looking beyond the hardware and soft- ware standards that have dom- inated the market for the past decade. Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment, Microsoft and Mips Computer are leading the \"Ace Initiative\" to estab- lish a new set of standards for the next generation of PCs as well as larger computers. IBM and Apple Computer have joined forces in an effort to create a new \"open systems platform\" based on object-ori- ented software, which greatly simplifies the process of devel- oping new applications. That is critical if the PC mar- ket is to regain the excitement of the 1980s. Manufacturers and industry analysts maintain that what the PC industry urgently needs are compelling new applications that will cre- ate new demand just as the emergence of spreadsheet pro- grams and desktop publishing programs did in the past.

   "text_content" : "THE European PC market is dominated by US and Asian producers, but PCs remain a critically Important source of revenue to European-based manufacturers, writes Alan Cale. Groupe Bull of France, for example, paid some 500m for the PC operations of Zenith Electronics of the US In 1989 In an effort to strengthen its hand in PCs. A heavy loss maker In the past couple of years, Bull has put in place a recovery plan which underlines the importance of the PC business. Within three years, up to 40 per cent of Bull's sales are expected to come from Zenith, compared with only 20 per cent at present. As another example, Philips of the Netherlands retained its PC operations when it sold its loss-making information systems division to Digital Equipment of the US earlier this year. The PC division will be managed within Philips' successful consumer electron- ics section - an indication of the extent to which PCs have become commodity products. Philips has invested heavily in a new technology called multi- media which combined PCs and compact disc players; expertise in PC technology is essential to its development. According to a new report from the newsletter Electron- ics Europe, Europe will proba- bly become the world's best market for business multime- dia applications, and Philips has a world lead through its development of interactive compact disk technology. Then there is International Computers of the UK, now owned by Fujitsu of Japan, which bought Nokia Data of Finland earlier this year, thus more than doubling its output of PCs. According to Mr Peter Bonfield.

They contribute 15 per cent of ICL's overall revenue, some Â£250m, with sales expected to increase significantly for the foreseeable future.\" Last month, ICL announced a Â£4.6m contract for 1,500 PCs by three regional banks in the French Credit Agricole bank- ing group, as well as a contract worth Â£7m over 12 months by British Gas. The European market for PCs, together with peripherals and software, is worth about Â£S0bn a year. There are still significant opportunities for growth, and the overall market is growing at between 10 and 20 per cent a year. Mr David Hooker, who manages ICL's PC business, says the company is forecasting 57 per cent growth in sales this year, boosted, he thinks, by the strategy of sell- ing PCs based on the latest microprocessor technology at the price of the preceding gen- eration; and its ability to pro- vide a high level of support to companies setting up complex computer networks. Olivetti, barely profitable at present as an information tech- nology company is Europe's most successful indigenous PC manufacturer. Its share of the market, however, has fallen from more than 11 per cent in 1987 to about 6.8 per cent in 1990. This includes sales made by Acorn, Olivetti's UK subsid- iary, which specialises in the education market. PCs are marketed by both Olivetti Office and Olivetti Systems and Networks (OSN), two of the company's four big marketing divisions. The range includes low end machines intended chiefly for the home market, professional office computers and high perfor- mance workstations. A significant success for Oli- vetti has been its agreement to supply Digital Equipment of the US with desktop machines for sale in Europe and portable computers for sale worldwide. Dr Kevin Brau, analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in London, warns, nevertheless, that Olivetti has some long-term problems in the PC area: \"At the high end, Olivetti PCs are not taken seriously enough by PC dealers or their customers. From a technologi- cal and quality standpoint, this may be unjust, but altering that perception will require imagination.\" On the other hand, Olivetti is aiming for 10 per cent of the European market for PCs by the end of this year. The porta- ble market is increasing at a compound annual growth rate of about 44 per cent, according to Dataquest, but it is a market dominated by Toshiba and, to a lesser extent, Compaq, and Oli- vetti has a battle on its hands. Amstrad, the pioneer of low- cost professional computers in Europe, is suffering from an image problem. Although its latest range of PCs is techni- cally excellent, quality prob- lems with an earlier range hurt its reputation; furthermore it no longer has the price advan- tage of earlier years. Amstrad computers are cheap, but no longer spectacularly so, com- pared with other suppliers. Mr Ray Sangster, Zenith vice president for Northern Europe, says that to stay in business, a European PC company must ensure that it has: * Access to the right technol- ogy. In practice this means establishing a strong relation- ship with chip manufacturers and software suppliers. * Established joint ventures. No company can do every- thing, and with product cycles now as short as 18 months, the successful manufacturer has to be on top of the trends. * Joined the right consortia. Industry standards are being set by lobbies like the ACE (Advanced Computing Envi- ronment) group. Most makers hedge their bets by joining them all. * Channel control - a good relationship with the dealers, distributors and value added resellers who are responsible for almost all PC sales these days. Traditionally, battles for dealers' favours have been fought out over discounts, but Mr Sangster detects a new trend in Europe. As the larger dealers face up to higher over- heads forced on them by the need to provide greater support for their customers, they are looking for discount levels based on a more sophisticated criterion than simple sales vol- ume. The suggestion is there should be a base discount aug- mented by extra points for the level of expertise the dealer can display. At the end, a mere 2% or 3 points would be added on for volume.",

   "text_content" : "NEXT year Intel expects to release a new generation of PC microprocessors. These 80586 chips will cram some 3 million transistors on a single device, and will run at 100 MHz - 10 times faster than the Intel chip powering IBMs original PC. Today you can buy a PC, Dells 450DE for example, pow- ered by Intel's 80486 micropro- cessor running at 50 MHz, 50 per cent faster than the 33 mgh 804868 on the market. Again, in 199 we will ee an 80486 run- ning at 66mgz, half as fast again. In all, says Ian Wilson, Intel UK's technical marketing man- ager, Intel expect to be able to double microprocessor perfor- mamnce every two years up to the end of the decader The question confronting PC systems builders - and their buyers and users too - is wh? What is this power for? T pace davelopmnt of microprocessor technoloy is awesome.

There are implications for users too. Richard Owen, work station manager for Hewlett Packard UK, observes that \"at the moment the desktop is a little over-powered. Most peo- ple are still running DOS soft- ware and that simply doesn't exploit the processor power. A 386 is more than good enough.\" Even with window environ- ments, the individual applica- tions are invariably DOS- based. BC, too, concedes that software development is still in the dark ages compared with microprocessor technology. This goes some way to explaining the low pick-up of 486 based machines - although the power glut has been compounded by supply delays. Andy Bull-Lewis of IDC, the research group, says 486s will constitute no more than 2 per cent of PC ship- ments this year, or around 4 per cent of shipment value. The faet is that while 386 and 486 are 32-bit chips, DOS is a 16ift operating system writ- ten more than a decade ago for a simple processor. Of course the situation is changing.

Client server networks are wide- spread - and that all points to more CPU horsepower,\" says Ian Wilson. Interesting, Motorola, Intel's long time microprocessor rival, offers much the same interpre- tation. \"The trend is clearly to heterogenous enterprise net- works. The world is moving to open systems, to interoperabil- ity driven by standards rather than clones,\" says Gordon Stubberfield, Motorola com- puter systems UK marketing manager. If this differs from Intel's view, it is in the fact that Intel is driven by the need to protect investment in the DOS PC base, paradoxically its greatest asset, through compatibility. Motorala's argument is that ultimately what users have on the desk's top, as a window on to the network, could as easily be a Mac, an ex-terminal or a work station as a conventional PC. The other complication is that it is bringing a Rise into competition with Intel's com- plex CISC technology for the first time \"The real caulenge for the desktop will come from Rise processors as they come down steadily in price,\" says Richard Owen.

   "text_content" : "PERSONAL computers helped end the Soviet putsch. The lim- ited numbers of PCs in the for- mer Soviet Union - estimated at between 500,000 and 750,000 - kept citizens throughout the former union informed during the crisis, writes Paul Abrahams. But now PCs are needed to save the revolution. The states that formed the USSR are des- perately short of computers to manage their economies. The pent-up demand for computers in the former Soviet bloc is immense, says Mr Tom Byrne of Marine Com- puter Systems, a joint venture between ICL of UK, the USSR Merchant Marine Ministry and the civic domestic consumer service board of Leningrad city council. He says the shortage of com- puters can be explained partly by the restrictions placed on the export of strategic materi- als Imposed by the Co-ordinat- ing Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). This was established in 1949 to curb the export to the Soviet IInIon and its allies of goods which could be used for mili- tary purposes. Until recently, Cocom for- bade the export of even low- powered PCs with 286 chips. As a consequence, there are a large number of software writ- ers in the former Soviet coun- tries capable of writing extremely tight code. Most of the future demand in the former USSR is likely to come from the state rather than individuals, says Mr Byrne. A standard 286 machine, he points out, costs about 80 times the average monthly salary. Th Lmain constriction on a potentially explosive growth is the absence of a convertible rouble: all trading in comput- ers is transacted in hard cur- rency. The telecommunica- tions infrastructure is also pitiful, with insufficient capac- ity and poor line quality. Companies such as ICL, Dec, IBM and Olivetti, meanwhile, are positioning themselves to exploit what may one day become an enormous market.",

An estimated 60m PCs con- tainingr Intel chips and con- trolled by Microsoft software have been sold in the past decade. Today, however, both compa- iles are facing anti-trust inves- tigations .by the: US Federal Trade Commission, and Intel has additionally been charged with anti-competitive practices in private lawsuits filed by two competitors. While the 'TC has not revealed the basis for either Investigation, and. no charges have been filed against the companies, it appears con- cerns have been prompted by Intel and Microsoft's virtual monopolies as suppliers to the $90bn PC market. Microsoft's MS-DOS operat- ing system and Intel's X86 microprocessors are critical elements of \"standard\" IBM- compatible PCs manufactured by dozens of US, European and Asian companies. Ironically, the spectre of anti-trust complaints against the semiconductor and soft- ware companiis has arisen just as both compmnies are facing * serious competition. Intel, long the sole suppier of micropro- cessor chips to almost all PC manufacturers (with the excep tion of Apple Compute in the , and NEC in Japin); Is sac- ing competition from rival chip makers, including. Advanced Micro Devices, that have \"cloned\" its popular micropro- cessors and related chips. Potentially imore threaten- ing, however, are computer industry alliances that could bypass Intel microprocessor chips to create new \"standard platforms\" for the next genera- tion of PCs. IBM and Apple. for example, have joined forces to co-develop new PCs to be based upon an IBM RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) microprocessor chip, dubbed the Power PC chip, rather than upon Intel chips. An industry consortium, led by Compaq Computer, MIPs Computer, Digital Equipment and Microsoft, and backed by some 60 hardware and software companies, has also set out to establish a new \"standard plat- form\" for the next generation of PCs. The Advaiced Compuootip environment (AC) Ou'a iosen two brands of micfopro- cessors as the stadard \"plaa forms\" for future oduc: : intel's microprocessors and rival devices developed by MIPs Cotnputer. It is cear, bowever, that the initial focus of members of thi' oup wll be upon developlng s base o MIP' chips, rather than on the current Intel and Microsoft are facing Iegal and competitive challenges standard Intel devices. In the meantime, Intel faces a potentially serious legal chal- lenge from rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, which last month filed a *2bn lawsuit against Intel charging the company with anti-trust violations. In its lawsuit, AMD claims that Intel has deliberately attempted to limit competition in the market for microproces- sors by \"keeping AMD out of the business and refusing to ' Itel ther th* AME n ift -, a \"s, u 't*t. AMD also claims that Intel' donspired 'cith acertain corn- S manuftctarsi and dmia to intuce micrprce1 - e to deal with AYD. to he. ptibmn of t Intel.uprod.

Like Intel, however, Microsoft is facing significant challenges. The software company's relation- ships with leading PC manu- facturers are strained, and competition from Unix, an AT&T computer operating sys- tem, threatens Microsoft's role as the primary supplier of systems software in the market for microprocessor-based com- puters. It is, however, the deteriora- tion of Microsoft's relationship with IBM that is gaining most attention within the industry. The long-time allies now acknowledge differences of opinion over the direction of PC software. While Microsoft is promoting its \"Windows\" pro. gram, in combination with DOS, as the operating software of choice for most PC users, IBM is firmly committed to a new generation of software based on OS/2, an operating system that the two companies developed together. Microsoft Is also embroiled in a drawn-out legal battle with Apple Computer over alleged copyright infringement of Apple's Macintosh software. Apple and IBM appear to have excluded Microsoft from their joint efforts to develop soft- ware for the next generation of PCs. Intel and Microsoft will undoubtedly continue to play a central role in the PC industry of the 1990s, but the virtual monopolies these companies have enjoyed for the past decade may be short-lived in the face of legal and competi- tive challenges.",

   "text_content" : "THE operating system standard is set to present PC users and software developers with a new set of problems. MS/DOS, the system which has been the standard platform for applications on the IBM PC and its lookalikes (\"clones\"), will soon go into decline. It will probably reach its peak of pop- ularity in 1993, but thereafter will yield ground rapidly to Unix and OS/2. MS/DOS will make up more than 70 per cent of sales of PC operating systems and graphi- cal user interfaces (GUIs) in Europe this year, with Unix and OS/2 holding only minimal shares. By 1996, however, the pro- portion of MS/DOS will fall to about a third, while Unix and OS/2 will each take about 10 per cent, according to IDC, the market research organisation. Meanwhile, the Apple's propri- etary Macintosh system is also gaining supporters. The result of this will be con- fusion among users and devel opers on a scale which has not been seen for a decade. Whatever the disadvantages of the IBM PC, it established an indisputable standard in the form of Microsoft's MS/DOS for most of a decade. This removed most of the worries about incompatibility that troubled the computing business at the beginning of the 1960s. But MS/DOS is becoming outdated because it was designed for the standalone PC market, which is giving way to networks. A networked envi- ronment needs an operating system which can easily han- dle multi-user and multi-task- ing situations. Troubles over the transition from 16-bit to 32- bit programming might echo those in the transition from 6-bit to 16-bit. Technical conflicts are com- plicated by the struggle for power between IBM and Micro- soft. The essential issue between the two is that Micro- soft's interest lies in getting its software on to as many differ- ent makes of PC as possible, whereas IBM's lies in denying the market to the clones. The main competitors with MS/DOS will be IBM's OS/2 and Unix, the open system that originated from AT&T and has made a big impact in the mid- range and workstation sectors. MS/DOS's life has been extended by a series of mis- haps to both Unix and OS/2. The former was slow to take off because several different versions were competing; the latter was affected by technical problems and the clash between Microsoft and IBM. MS/DOS has also been regen- erated by Microsoft's GUI - called Windows 3 - which has been very successful in the last 18 months. However, the launch of a 32- bit portable version of Win- dows, known as Windows New Technology, scheduled for next summer, may push users from MS/DOS towards 08/2. Microsoft's intentions for Windows have been the subject of controversy and remain unclear. There have been doubts about plans to make Windows New Technology compatible at the binary code level with 08/2 and thus pro- vide a migration path from Windows 8 to OS/2. Whether it decides to intro- duce that compatibility may depend on the success of 08/2. IBM has stated its intention to make 0812 a standard on a par with MS/DOS, but many observers think IBM will try to use it to regain market share from the clones. IBM is due to bring in ver- sion 2.0 of OS/2 this autumn, and will accompany it with a heavy marketing campaign. Users and developers are waiting anxiously to see whether this version of the code will be as strong as IBM has indicated. It will be a crucial moment for IBM, as OSI2 is an integral part of its blueprint for the future of software known as Systems Applications Architec- ture (SAA). Most of SAA remains theory at present; OS2 could change that. The credi- bility of SAA and IBM's indus- try reputation rest heavily on the'deivery of a fully function- vyen loyal IBM customers have had their doubts about it up to now. IBM cannot afford to fail with OS/2 and risk alien- ating those customers. Mr Martin Milautzack of IDC comments: \"The situation is very difficult now for users. They are having to spend much money on IT in a very uncertain situation. The ques- tion is, whose promises can they believe?\" When 08/2 2.0 is launched, offering compatibility with existing MS/DOS and Windows 3 applications, software houses will have to decide whether to develop for that platform as well as Windows 3. As yet the progress of OS/2 is held up by lack of applications. There are few for OS/2 itself, and fewer for its GUI, Presenta- tion Manager. IBM is trying to help software houses acceler- ate their production of applica- tions, but there will not be many significant new pro- grams before mid-1993. Software houses are thus still unsure which platform to target for the mid-1990s. Unix should be the best for develop- ers in the scientific, technical and engineering fields, where it has already established itself on more powerful workstat- ions. But OS/2 has the important advantage of applications com- 1 patibility with MS/DOS and is rlikely to be used in offices - where PCs have to communi- k cate with larger IBM systems. Developers have to ensure that they have targeted the platforms of the future while keeping their ever-mounting costs under control. Mr Paul Bailey, UK manag- i ing director of Lotus, the > spreadsheet company, has tracked the platform issue since the mid-1980s and has studied the problems dogging - OS/2 and Windows. In 1989 > Lotus decided to throw its - resources at Windows 8, when - it looked a stronger option i than OS/2. Now Mr Bailey is - keen to find out whether OS/2 2.0 will do everything IBM says i it will. Novell, the local area net- working firm, is having to increase its research effort to cover all the possible options. Its marketing specialist, Mr John Lo Conte, says it is sup- porting work on OS/2, the Apple Macintosh and Unix operating systems simulta- neously. Smaller software houses, however, are likely to have to restrict themselves to concen- trating on the Windows 3 plat- form. The biggest unknown factor in the equation is the recent 'agreement between Apple and IBM. The deal has been inter- preted as another attempt by IBM to regain control over platforms from Microsoft. A jointly developed operat- ing system incorporating a new programming technique called object orientation is expected in the mid-1990s. The output of the venture is vague at this stage, however. To bring Apple's Macintosh tech- nology in line with IBM's OS/2 seems an extremely challeng- ing aim.",

PC sales channels, relatively sta- ble since the launch of the IBM PC, are once more on the move. The microcomputer's rather intricate route to the customer developed as a consequence of its cheapness and portability. Minicomputer and mainframe manufacture has traditionally been complex and expensive, so only a few large organisa- tions have been able to sustain sales forces to go direct to the customer. Microcomputers, on the other hand, fed the growth of smaller manufacturers, higher sales levels and far wider distribution. The more fragmented nature of the manufacturers and the customer base meant there was a need for multi-tiered dis- tribution rather than the old direct manufacturer-to-cus- tomer relationship. IBM's own odyssey through the channels illustrates this. Prior to the launch of the PC, IBM sold direct, but began to acquire dealers as the new standard took off. Its direct sales of .PCs declined as the explosion reverberated, and in 1985 it appointed its first dis- tributor in the UK, MBS. The company's channel strategies became more com- plex as more distributors were appointed, but in 1988 IBM went into sharp reverse, alter- ing its discount structures in favour of dealers, and effec- tively killing off its distribu- tion base. This moved IBM to a distri- bution model more in line with that of arch-rival Compaq, but this structure in itself is now threatened, and is being increasingly questioned by the companies employing it - IBM included. The best way to cat- egorise what is happening is to say that the industry is moving towards a multiple entry-point distribution structure. One of IBM's first toes in the water was to begin selling its entry-level machine, the PS/1, through high street retailer Dixons (a strategy to be boosted this month when Dix- ons begins selling a far more powerful 386SX-based version of the machine), but IBM UK personal systems manager Howard Ford also talks of far less formally structured approaches to marketing in the future. Mr Ford is a key part of an organisational reshuffle earlier this year which placed empha- sis on IBM's European struc- ture, and he reports both to IBM UK and to the personal sytems division in Paris. The last few months have seen several European initia- tives being piloted in various European territories, two of the most significant being a mail order sales scheme, which is still confidential, and the broadening of IBM's \"options\" (effectively, add-on products) to third party distribution. The latter does not mean that IBM is going back to dis- tributors, but is a sign that the company no longer feels it can go it alone. IBM itself has begun selling the industry standard network operating system, Novell Netware, and the broadening of options dis- tribution allows third party distributors to sell IBM-badged equipment such as Token Ring networking equipment. The mail order experiment, should it go live throughout Europe, could have a broader significance. Mr Ford is at pains to stress that IBM will do nothing that will compete with its existing business partners, so the company is unlikely to find itself selling machines direct to corporate customers in the short term. He concedes this implies that a mail order scheme will either sell prod- ucts IBM's dealers do not sell, or will sell into areas not cov- ered by IBM's dealers. That second possibility may be the crux of the matter. IBM is not the only company interested in Dixons. Apple is widely tipped to be next, and Dixons's interest in broadening its PC range is a sign of the increasing commodification of the PC. They are cheaper and more user-friendly, customers are better educated, and the market for low-maintenance direct sales is vastly increased. This is manifested in a reces- sion-defying explosion of-small- dealers/manufacturers. A dealer can become a \"manufac- turer\" by striking up a rela- tionship with a few Far East- ern component manufacturers, and assembling its own-brand boxes, and then it is simply a matter of competing, through magazine advertising, on the basis of the price performance ratio. This sector of the market is also fuelled indirectly by the manufacturers, whose sales target requirements often lead to excess equipment spilling over from manufacturers, dis- tributors or large dealers into \"unofficial\" channels. The high volume, low mar- gin approach is hazardous even at the best of times, but the alternatives are scarcely less so. A few larger dealers, such as Computacenter, SCC (Special- ist Computer Centres) or P&P's direct sales arm can command sufficient in the way of corpo- rate accounts to be able to avoid the difficulties small, low margin dealers face, but the only viable alternative for those without the resources to grow fast is to add value to the basic equipment, thus com- manding higher margins. Value Added Reseller (VAR) and Systems Integrator pro- grammes are, however, them- selves vulnerable to the rate- cutting sector of the market, as they can only be sustained if the dealer is able to justify the price in terms of services. All too often a VAR programme has at its core a PC twice the price of rival machines for no clear reason. And if you stand still in the VAR market, the low end of the market passes you in terms of expertise. A good VAR must, therefore, plough large sums into staff training, and be forever on the lookout for technology new enough, and complex enough, for margins to be preserved.",

   "text_content" : "WHEN corporate data processing relied on central- ised mainframes, security issues were relatively easy to keep under control. But with PCs came a proliferation of hardware (which can fail), floppy disks (which can spread viruses), and easy access to data (which can engender fraud). Deficiencies in back-up systems in case hardware fails is the biggest security problem, says Dr Alan Soloman, chief executive of S&S International, of Berkhamsted in Hertford- shire. \"A hard disk is the same as a washing machine, a car or an electric mower - they eventu- ally all stop working. A car or washing machines can be replaced, but your data can- not.\" According to Dr Soloman, many companies forget to back up their hard disks and there- fore have no duplicate source. of data. The results can be disastrous, he says. \"If your company loses its accounts you don't know who owes you money. You don't even know who your customers or suppli- ers are.\" Mr David Frost, a partner at management consultants Price Waterhouse, says that in his experience 90 per cent of com- panies which lose the use of their computer systems and do not have contingency plans, go out of business. Even those that do back-up their data often ignore basic housekeeping rules by storing disks locally. If a fire swept through the office, both PC and disk would be destroyed; or if the machine were stolen, the thief might take the floppy disks as well. \"Most companies are actu- ally in the data processing business but they only realise it when they have no data,\" points out Dr Soloman. Although lack of back-up is a common problem, the spread of computer viruses is also rife and a topic which even the most computer-illiterate chief executives now recognise. Computer viruses are pro- grams which copy themselves from one computer to another, and can destroy the integrity of the data. They come in a number of forms, many with exotic names. With the \"cas- cade\" virus, for example, all the characters fall from the top of the screen into a pile at the bottom; while the \"Italian\" virus generates a ball which bounces across the computer screen. The first signs that a virus has crept into the computer network might be a change in file size and a change in the date of the file. These are sac- tors which most computer UsKS will never notice. Other symptoms are the computer crashing or taking a 10 time to carry out basic Although it was not until about 1987 that the first viruses appeared, there are now about 250 of them docu- Imented. Although virus developers Ninety per cent of companies which lose the use of their computer systems and do not have contingency plans, go out of business, says a partner at Price Waterhouse. Fire, theft, vandalism and fraud are all very real threats to any computer-based business see it as a challenge to develop the most sophisticated and undetectable viruses, the comr sorting news for companies is that any virus that attacks thi corporate data files is likely te be one of the more commoi varieties. These can be detected and eradicated usin- virus checking software froi companies such as Sophos o Abingdon, SS International, oi International Data Security o London. These programs worl by checking for the individual pattern that every virus leaves in the program. However, the problem for compaies with large numbers of dis is to find out which PC or disk is infected. The damage to data might be trivial, but it can take, days to search through thousands of disks in order to find the rogue one. More pernicious viruses can actually make small variations to the data held on the com- puter,a particular problem if it involves payments. The dilemma then is that by the I time the virus has been noticed, it may be too late to retrieve accurate data from old files. Again, the situation is com- i pounded if there are no back- Sups of the data. Altering data deliberately is i one of the easiest ways for f computer fraudsters to obtain r illegal funds. Fraudsters are f aided by modern computer architectures in which com- 1 pany employees can get access s to data held throughout the nmnltrio nmwnvrw frmm #fhr. own PC or terminals. Today's fraudulent attacks fall into two main types: single largeascale frauds, where mil- lions of pounds are removed in one swoop, or \"salami attacks\", as Donn Parker, senior man- agement consultant at SRI International, in California, calls them. In these attacks small amounts of money are sliced away over a period of time, the intent of the thief being to disguise the losses. Whereas computer crimes in the past were largely the work of disgruntled employees, today the widespread use of computer systems in financial applications - payroll, funds transfer or bill payment - has offered organised crime a lucrative opportunity. Today most potential frauds are thwarted by regular checks, says Dr Ken Wong, account development director for security at PA Consulting. But checks can be rudimentary and often arbitrary. Dr Wong believes that selective check- ing, using the latest expert systems could prove less expensive and equally effec- tive. In the case of a bank or credit card company, for exam- ple, the expert system would be programmed to know that a Â£2,000 transaction at a top-class store such as Harrods would probably be genuine, whereas a transaction of the same amount from the local chain store might not be. Because defrauding a busi- ness involves getting funds out of the organisation, another, basic precaution is to instigate checks at the periphery of the financial system, at. all points where money leaves the com- pany. To prevent outsiders from defrauding the company, a strictly enforced access control system is a first step. Today this usually involves pass- words, which have to be tapped into the system before a user is allowed to use the PC. In the future, biometrie devices, such as retina scan- ners or thumbprint recognition machines, could also help enforce security. Although these do give extra protection - it is impossible to change a thumbprint, or a ret> ina - once a hacker has taken a thumbprint, he or she can gain access to the computer system repeatedly without being challenged. A less expensive but secure option might be to insist that employees choose unusual passwords and change them regularly. The most frequently selected passwords today are still the name of a spouse, child - or even a pet.",

The advent of optical disks, compress ing the data that creates visual imNas on-screen, meant that intricate da grams couid be stored and recovered quickly and sinply. Unisys was about to launch its prototype image process ing technologynlm RRA agreed to test Info but with its own agenda. Mr Haw and his colleagues intended to use it as a jumping off point for their own development. With Infolmage, a document can be scanned into the system and join the archive in six minutes. Speed a archiv- ing and retrieval is critical. The 150 employees in Hawley's department can access the archive at any one of SO woikstations. InfoImage had to justify its existence by clear cost savings, and by 19M3 it will have paid for itself Some productivity gains are hard to quantify. \"I think the bottom line is that we could do the same job tomorrow with fewer people,\" Mr Hawley observes. Others gains are dramatic. Tracing an engineering draw- ing took three days and cost Â£200 before image processing was installed. Now the process takes lix minutes and costs m20. The key to image procesing at RRA is an indigenous database, the Parts Information Management System (Pims). While Infomage stores a whole drawing, Pims holds the technical data that makes sense of its parts. RRA regards image processing as one weapon in its struggle against a larger problem. \"The company has a legacy of live documentation which, if not effec- tively indexed, stored and made avail- able to staff through fast retrieval systems, could swamp us and prevent the full achievement of our business strategy.\" RRA is reluctant to put a price tag on its entry into the image processing game. Unisys says that a PC-based sys- tem starts at Â£50,000. Image-processing is based around the familiar concept of workstations, physically resembling a PC but powered by a very fast chip suited to demanding applications. In the vocabulary of image processing, workstations are transformed into seats. A three-four seat Unisys installa- tion costs Â£100,000 - Â£150,000. Citibank Mortgages was forced to examine the economic benefits of image-processing very carefully. It han- dles mortgages for insurance companies and independent brokers. The house- buyer has no idea that he or she is a Citibank customer until an offer is made. The paperwork involved in process ing mortgage applications is' horren- dous. .Sch is the amount of informa- tion, that storage on a mainframe computer is not an economic propose- tion. Paper files are still necessary to maintain the detail of an applicatlon. Every query on that appication ties. down staff in a paper chase. By 1886, with the housing boom well under way, citibank anticipated it would be han- dling two million pieces of paper a year in 1991. It was a prediction made in a buoyant market, and Â£1 million was invested in image processing equipment from 01- \"vet. The idea was to banish paper cer- tificates to a secure holding site well away from the bustle of Citibank's West London offices. Olivetti's contribution to image pro- cessing is known as Optical Scanning and Recognition (Osar). Just like Uni- sys' InfoImage, equipment licensed from the US Filenet Corporation is at the heart of Osar. Osar processes the file through a scanner, capturing the image in binary form. It is a glorified photo-copier, although Brian Howells, operations director at Citibank Mortgages, notes that Olivetti sales staff are sensitive to such comparisons.

They are stored elsewhere in a fireproof vault. Floor space has been saved in Inner London, but that's the least of Howells' image-ocessing dis- Icounts. Citibank is saving Â£200,000 a year in staff productivity. 'There have been no redundancies, but our growth has not required a parallel increase in people.\" As any estate agent can testify, that growth has not matched the optimistic forecasts of the mid-1980s. But Citibank is handling enough mortgages to justify the cost of image processing. Osar devours 5,000 pieces of paper a day. In a year, 13 million items are fed into the system.",

Says one: \"I'm impressed - and I'm a systems analyst!\" Most visitors to the Micro Gallery are unaware that they are participating in the first wave of multi-media technol- ogy. Apple, which supplied the hardware and has a huge stake in multi-media, calls it \"the future of computing\". U WflS pm u m ww inousny I Va prW UEIU@ sÂ·r;,l Â·Â· Â· ITi ~Â·irn~3rÂ·rÂ·r~e~~ Â·~r Multi-media is an umbrella term for using familiar tech. nolo to create striking and original images. Tie video, audio, text and graphics together, and you have multi- media. Suddenly it is being pressed on business as the truly modern way to create a hard-bitting presentation. It owes its existence to a series of slight but significant advances in PC technology. The advent of the CD-rom, the latest and most compressed form of media storage for PCs, allows the user to pull down sophisticated visual images on to the humble PC screen. In theory you get a whole new world without any more invest- ment than the CD-rom drive. Hypercard, a software toolkit that allows a computer pro- gram to be written in visual terms, was seized by Apple and has been shipped with every Macintosh PC since 1988. With Hypercard driving the user along through simple images, it becomes possible to create multi-media programs. All PCs are now sold with inbuilt microphones, so the audio ele- ment of CD-roms can be exploited. The humble PC is no longer limited to communicat- ing in pained beeps whenever an error is keyed in. When the Micro Gallery was planned three years ago, the hardware needed in order to deliver complex images on- screen instantly simply wasn't available. Any delay in deliver- ing pictures would cost the user's attention. The Micro Gallery project proceeded on the basis that hardware would catch up. Each of 12 workstations accesses a 1.3 gigabyte hard disk. The specification cited that it should take less than one second to call images up to the 19-inch colour screen. That speed can be obtained from the latest, topend, Macintosh, the IIF. The bill for this, the larg- est interactive reference library open to the public, was Â£7200,000. Another multi-media mover is Optech, of which Ewan Mac- Gregor is managing director. The company sells CD-rom disks packed with information on everything fkom the Middle East geopolitical situation to the authentic roar of a tiger. For someone in the business, Mr MacGregor is openly cyni- cal. \"Multi-media is a vastly over-used term,\" he says. \"It's a pretty trendy thing to be in.\" Mr MacGregor makes the point that although the theory of seamless presentations is appealg, the reality can be peie. Assembing a multi- media presentation without aoal assistance is a tall order. Cal in the pofesdonals to stitch video and graphics together, and your PC package starts costing big money. One serious - Â£5,250 - multi-media tool used by such as the RAF, Mercury Telecom, and Nationwide Anglia build- ing society, is Authorware. It allows the user to create an in-house training programme. The big plus is that Author- ware dispenses with the need to shoot a video. It's cheaper, and presentation skills are not needed. In the past, Nationwide's training staff in Northampton produced interactive videos at the cost of about 100 working hours each. \"Using Author- ware, we can get this down to 25 hours,\" says Paul Robson, Open Learning Manager, Nationwide Anglia. That saving exists largely due to the experience the staff had in creating videos for the building society's employees. Their expertise made multi- media a practical proposition. Their training package will run on workstations at local offices and extend staff train- ing without demanding more trainers. Nationwide Anglia has taken the idea of Computer Based Training (CBT) and developed it. So far that-is the only visible business benefit to emerge from the multi-media hype. Potentially serious players are lining up. The Multi-Media Company (MMC), led by former senior BBC people, under- stands the glamour of TV. Con- ferences can beWboring, and multi-media is an ideal substi- tute - but the only customer so far has been Apple. Its recent Cannes conference had room for just 500 people, so MMC put it on a CD-rom for the rest. Peter Armstrong, MMC chairman, was formerly head of BBC TV South East. Arm- strong and two fellow BBC directors bought out the Corpo- ration's Interactive TV Unit in February 1990. The BBC retains a share, and the main agenda of the MMC is publish- ing BBC programmes on CD-rom. Mr Armstrong retains faith in the interactive side of multi-media, the fact that an audience can call up images when they want. \"It won't be a flash in the pan, any more than printing's been a flash in the pan,\" he says. CD-rom is a better form of storage for data-greedy applica- tions involving high-quality images. For smart training establishments, it boosts CBT. For a fledgling multi-media industry to exploit this capabil- ity it should beware of false starts. Wiich-l Damp\"y",

   "text_content" : "THERE is more to making PCs effective in a corporate envi- ronment than simply plugging them together in a network. If they are to contribute to corpo- rate productivity in the same way that they have helped per- sonal productivity, PC net- works must be able to present usable applications. One of the key ways to do this is groupware, a type of software which brings individ- ual PCs on a network together at themapplication level. Top computer software sup- pliers are already homing in on groupware as one of the main growth areas of the next decade: \"We believe that what software did for the personal computer in the 1980s, group- ware will do for the network in the 1990s,\" said Lotus's chief executive Jim Manzi in a pre- sentation last June. Lotus is well ahead of its competitors in the groupware market with its Notes product. Notes, which was launched 18 months ago, furnishes a high-level application environ- ment on a network of PCs. In itself, it is not an application as such. It provides the bones of an application and can be used for such tasks as cus- tomer tracking, status report- ing project management and what Lotus calls \"collaborative free-form discussion\". Notes uses a relatively new \"architecture\" called the cli- ent/server model which allows the \"front end\" of an applica- tion to be totally separated from the \"back-end\". The user, as the \"client\", sees a screen with a modern graphical user interface - much like any other PC application. But behind the screen the software provides links to services such as database and electronic mail - powered by other computers known as servers. These can be located in the same office or at the other end of a telephone line on a wide-area network. Lotus Notes can cope with a wide range of data formats pro- duced by other software pack- ages - such as Microsoft Word wordprocessing documents and tagged image format files (TIFF). It also works with all the big PC network systems such as Novell's Netware-and 05/2 LAN manager. The essence of groupware Is its ability to control the move- ment of documents and data through the system. This ensures that all of the users in a particular department who are supposed to examine or comment on an item, see it. It thus acts as a control mecha- nism and, theoretically, makes workers more productive. The members of a group, of course, do not need to be located in the same geographi- cal location. The network allows them to be spread The members of a group can move out of the office and spread right across a city, a country - or even across the world across a city, a country or even across the world. Lotus Notes has already been taken on by 80 of the For- tune 500 companies in the USA and the appeal of the product is spreading. But Lotus does not have the field to itself. Apple Computer is making a strong push into the group- ware market following the recent upgrade to the Apple Macintosh operating system software. The new version of the Macintosh, called System 7, incorporates many of the mechanisms needed to build groupware applications - the most innovative being a sea- ture called Publish and Sub- scribe. This feature can be used to make data and docu- ments available to users on a network of Macintosh PCs. Julian Wilson, a business development manager at Apple UK, says it is working closely with the Central Computer Technology Agency (CCTA), the UK government body, on a project called the Computer Supported Co-Operative Work- group (CSCW). \"The CCTA has recognised that workgroup technologies are essential as the pattern of work changes in the 1990s. I think a lot more people in organisations will find them- selves working in teams and will need to cultivate a wider range of skills than in the past,\" says Mr Wilson. Apple is working with sev- eral partners on groupware applications. The US software company On Technology has produced two applications: eetingmaker,. which searches ndividuals' electronic diaries to find an appropriate \"slot\" for the members of a group to meet; and Instant Update, a program to ensure that copies of data are kept in line. A small UK company called FCMC is finding a ready mar. ket for its groupware product Staffware. FCMC managing director, John O'Connell, describes Staftware as a tool \"to automate bureaucracy\". Staffware has attracted some heavyweight users. British Telecom uses it for automate procurement and an electronic suggestion box; and the giant US Veterans Administration is using it for document tracking in its Project Noava. Hardware manufacturers have also latched on to Staff- ware and the product is sold by ICL as Powerflow and by Uni- sys as Office Procedures. Mr O'Connell warns, how- ever, that installing groupware is not a simple task: \"A high level of skills is needed to install it, and the software must be very flexible.\" It nevertheless seems likely that groupware will increas- ingly be used to solve problems resulting from the switch from centralised corporate commut- ing to distributed computing on networks.

   "text_content" : "THERE can be little doubt that PC networks are replacing tra- ditional mainframe and mini- computer systems based on \"dumb\" terminals. All the trends point in this direction. But the introdiuction of PC networks is not without its problems. A recent survey of more than 100 network managers from the Times Top 000 UK companies, commissioned by US network vendor 3Com and conducted by Benchmark Research, shows that' most companies (93 per cent of the sample) are finding it hard to contain networking costs, and that they expect the problem to get worse. Alarmingly, a third of the sample are unsure of the true cost of their networks, while 93 per cent are finding it hard to contain networking costs. Only 5 per cent were satisfied with the current cost of their networks. More alarmingly, a third of the sample are unsure of the true cost of their networks, and only 5 per cent were satis- fied with the current cost of their networks. The problem lies in the inte- gration of the many network protocols and different cabling systems. Network protocols are the \"language\" used for com- munications between the dif- ferent components in a net- work. The Benchmark survey shows that more than 80 per cent of company networks use more than three different pro- tocols, and nearly 60 per cent use more than two different ambfg y -tems. cft*mW we bein forced to ido*tmulttad e tchn olocles to-meet the dboeml n ar* usr. to comnect dimn Ibcal4reai networks (La) within their Some 80 per centof compa- nies alrea4y have Lans attached to their corporate net- works and this has pushed the complexity of their networks beyond their capacity to con- trol them. The survey also found that few companies have sufficient staff resources to support the networks they have installed. 3Com says it has identitled a cost/complexity barrier - the point where network costs increase beyond economic lev- els. It goes on to say that this barrier is likely to be reached in many companies where net- work traffic is increasing at more than 25 per cent a year. With the anticipated move to new technologies like open systems, multi-vendor net- works and client/server systems, this level of growth is conservative and the real increase in network traffic will be much higher. \"There is no doubt that PC Lans are the main contributor to the increasing complexity of corporate networks,\" says Tom Plimmer, managing director of 3Com in the UK. \"There iaatoawing denmi$ for dgrate ve data on the kt and thase demand gow, there is *a need for ineaft ed, bandwidth'in not- works,\" .r Plimmer goes on. In simple terms, bandwidth In natwork coan otinc an can be compared to the diameter of a \"pipe\" in a central-heating sys- tem. With a bM or pipe, more water can travet'log it. The bigger the bandwidth, the more data can be transmitted across the netiork. With the Increased demand for imagis and other services; which require very large amounts of data, the bigger the bandwidth needed to transmit data. 3Com's answer is to propose a simpler networking model which can be expanded with- out increasing the number of protocols supported. It also says that increased reliance on the public data communica- tions services for managing connections between different network technologies will help. The research identifies the three leading protocols desired by users as TCP/IP, XS and Novell's SPX/IPX - each of which was cited by more than 20 per cent of the sample. But there is a long list of other protocols required by users including DECnet (15 per cent), IBM's SDLC (8 per cent), OSI (5 per cent) and NetBios (4 per cent). Currently Novell's SPX/IPX leads the field - it is installed in 35 per cent of the sample - with TCP/IP (26 per cent) and DECnet (22 per cent) following. The survey confirms the trend away from proprietary proto- cols like DECnet and Novell to industry standard protocols like X.25 and TCP/IP. Despite the inherent prob- lems of installing PC networks, pioneering users have bitten the bullet and are starting the transition from the traditional central computer. Mercury, the UK telecommu- nications carrier, placed an order for 4,000 Apple Macin- toshes last month to form the basis of its new corporate information processing system. Anthony Smith, Mercury's information system director says the change is a necessary part of the company's expan- sion plans: \"As we grow, we see top-notch business process- ing as a major source of com- M71,OOO-ti,060,00 25010,000 - 9m.000 cerslaoo-rEmomo mia~~oo-gsaojoo C101,000 -M25A.W 51 000 - C100,00 iO.000 - C50.000 App.lximb wmd Iguri r~r ru rr pm- led 7 )nl Owl rmrr~ rrlllÂ·~n Â·Illrl Â·rrÂ·Â· Â·Ilrrr rl Â·LI IIIYUU FACTORS INPLUNMCING THE WAYS NETWORKS HAVE OROWN Factor Respondms (%) increased user demand ............................................................... 36 Business demands ............................................................... 27 Most cost-effective route ...................................... ........... 14 Increased application demand ....................................................... 7 Need for increased data access .................................................. 6 Need for Improved communications .............................................. 6 Available technology ................................................................ 6 Company structure ...................................................................... 4 Mainframe access requirements ........................................ ..... 4 Performance requirements ....................................................... 4 Increasing distributed processing ........................................ 3 Standardisation ................................................... .......................... 2 None ................................................................ 2 Don't know ................................................................................. 1 SoureS: Benchmur* Resarh r 1 h Y i, petitive advantage. \"We want to deploy the lat- est and the best technology and we believe this means Apple Macintosh, because they are the easiest to integrate into our existing systems,\" says Mr Smith. Mercury currently uses large IBM and DEC computers and one of the main advantages of the Macintosh, according to Mr Smith, is the ability to make connections between the Mac- intosh and these systems. \"We need to be able to emu- late the old DEC and IBM ter- minals and this is straightfor- ward with the Macintosh\" he says. Mercury will use the Ora- cle database package to pro- vide database integration across the all three types of computer. Mr Smith accepts that net- work complexity and the diffl- culty of supporting a dispersed user base are problems his company must face. He says, however, that Mercury has anticipated the problems and is putting management struc- tures in place to ensure the problems do not get out of con- trol: \"We are putting a three- tier support system in place - end user training to handle small-scale local problems, departmental support for more complex problems and central- ised support for the really diffi- cult ones,\" explains Mr Smith. As a telecommunications supplier, Mercury is in a better position than most companies to appreciate the potential pit- falls which might come from moving to PC networks. Mr Smith says that there is really no choice: \"We have to face the simple fact that we must do it. It is the only way we can be sure of maintaining and improving our market position.\" Many other companies will face the same challenge in the next decade as PC networks replace traditional information processing structures.

   "article_dc_title" : "Modems Will Survive",
   "text_content" : "THE market for modems - 'modulator/demodulator devices which carry data between computers across the telephone - looks to have bet- ter prospects than had been forecast. Some industry-watchers had said the advent of the new inte- grated services digital network (ISDN) telecommunications technology would make anal- ogue modems obsolete. Now, however, it is thought that modem sales will fall only slowly until the late 1990s, when ISDN starts to take over. ISDN will mainly serve large firms with a lot of data to 'transmit. For smaller firms, modems will remain more attractive. There will be a time lapse between ISDN coming into common use in big cities, and being able to support users in more remote places. Moreover, ISDN is likely to affect leased-line modems more severely than dial-up models. Leased line models have been in decline for several years, while dial-up machines have been spreading rapidly as their speed of performance has improved and the cost has come down. Some analysts now expect that many modems will be used eventually for interwork- ing with ISDN, instead of being replaced by it. There are several reasons to believe that modem use will expand in the next few years: * Demand for more powerful and flexible modems is increas- ing, mainly because PCs are getting more powerful and have larger memories, so there is more data to be communi- cated; * Users are creating more graphics, which occupy more memory than text files and therefore take longer to trans- mit; * They also require faster response times. As people try to get more from their systems - soon, perhaps, wanting simultaneous voice and data interaction between offices - faster and more versatile modems will be wanted. Mark Orchart, marketing manager for UK supplier Dowty Information Systems, argues that modem technology is progressing fast enough to hold off any threat from ISDN. a Also, there are many new UK modem market suppliers Dowly/CASE BT Dataconmm Racal Tricom Pace Motorola GPT Hayes IBM Amstrad 1989 revenue (: au SouMO :Dtaquet users, such as small businesses and doctors' practices, which are just starting to use PC communications. Another reason for modem makers to be optimistic is the European Commission's direc- tive on the provision of open networks, which comes into operation at the beginning of 1993. It will force some other countries to follow the British lead in liberalising their tele- communications. This will stimulate competi- tion in modems as in other electronics markets, although national regulations will still make international marketing difficult. With national telecommum- The volume of modem sales in the UK has been increasing at around 24 per cent a year, and has not suffered too seriously from the recession. However, revenue from sales has been flat for three years. cations at different stages of evolution, there is an opportu- nity for a number of levels of sophistication of modem to be marketed over several years. John Babb, European gen- eral manager of Hayes Micro- computer Products, a leading US modem maker, thinks the focus will shift from the mature markets of the UK and France to the emerging mar- kets of Germany, Italy and Spain. Leading European suppliers, such as Dowty and BT Data- coms in the UK, and Siemens, Nokia and Alcatel on the Con- tinent, will be challenged by US and Asia Pacific firms - although the Japanese have yet to make any serious impact in this sector. The evidence from the UK, which is by far Europe's larg- est and most free modem mar- ket, is that deregulation encourag s more players, although lot all survive. ,The'UK market has been helped by the British Approv- als Board for Telecommunica- tions (BABT), which has made it easier for manufacturers with good products to get them approved. Also, buyers' decisions have been simplified by the consen- sus on technical standards, which is steered by the Consul- tative Committee on Interna- tional Telephones and Telegra- phy (CCITT). Another factor in the increase of modem sales is the rise in the number of people working at a distance from headquarters. Many salesmen, for example, work some of the time in clients' premises and some of the time at home. They often need to download data from their PCs to the cor- porate system overnight. However, informed opinion is that working from home, although on the increase, is still a small influence. Office to office communication is still driving modem sales far more than home to office. Sales are also helped by the growing number of \"bulletin boards\", which are, indepen- dently-run message exchange systems serving a wide range of special interest grup. The volume of K miodem sales has been increasing at around 24 per cent a year and has not suffered too seriously from the recession. However, revenue from sales has been flat for three years. As with other types of com- puter hardware, technological advances and the tougher eco- nomic cliniate have combined to depress suppliers' profits. Modem salesmen have found more network managers want- ing to bargain over prices. The volume of UK modem sales is expected to drop steadily during the 1990s, while revenue growth may hold up at about 2 per cent until the mid-@ die of the decade. As competition intensifies, manufacturers are obliged to include more special features just to get on to buyers' short- lists, even though some of those features may not be used. Some are bundling spe- cial software in order to make their machine more user- friendly. A fax capability is becoming regarded as essen- tial. Demand is still high for the relatively slow 2,400 bits per second (bps), or V.22bis stan- dard, models. These are popular with PC users who interrogate data- bases online, but do not often transmit large files. The big growth area is in the V.32 9,600 bps machines, according to Richard Mitchell, an associate director of the market research organisation Dataquest. UK sales of V.32 machines rose from 33,000 units in 1989 to 48,000 in 1990. Jeff Soulsby, UK distribution manager for UK producer Racal-Milgo, says it is easy to justify an investment in upgrading to V.32 modems on grounds of cost-saving in line time. A concern for modem users such as the financial services institutions has been the vul- nerability of their networks to data hackers. However, improved security features on modems such as the use of passwords, dialback and encryption techniques are making them more robust all the time.",

Portables, which defied the slowing sales patterns in the personal com- puter market during the late 1960s, have been hit by overca- pacity and slacking demand. The heady years such as 1969, when European unit sales of portables increased - admittedly from a low base - by as much as 79 per cent a year, are over. Unit sales growth for portables has slowed according to Dataquest, the UK market research com- pany. About 723,000 portables were sold in Europe last year, an increase of about 55 per cent - well below what had been previously forecast. Dataquest estimates that portable unit growth will increase by about 37 per cent next year, slowing to about 17 per cent a year by 1995. The fastest growing sector, it reck- ons, will be the market for notebooks, which it defines as weighing less than 7lbs. Although such growth is far greater than any other section of the computer market, it is undoubtedly insufficient to support the large and ever increasing number of vendors. Toshiba, the European mar- ket leader, estimates that whereas there were about 35 portable suppliers in 1989, this year more than 150 companies exhibited at Comdex, the com- puter show. Compaq, the US manufacturer, says it gave up counting the number of its competitors when they passed the 300 mark. The main reasons for the explosion in vendors has been the falling cost and increasing availability of specialist porta- ble computer components. This is particularly true in the light- weight notebook sector, where companies such as Toshiba and Compaq were able to domi- nate during the late 1980s thanks to their technological lead. Now, both established vendors, such as IBM and Com- modore, and a host of clone manufacturers, many based in the Far East, have launched credible products. Not surprisingly the market leaders have seen their market lead eroded by the new entrants. Dataquest estimates Tim MastePORT-3 8X from Zenlh Datb Systems. Portables ere holding their own among sophlstcated bigger products that Toshiba had 28.5 per cent of the European notebook mar- ket by value during the second quarter of this year, while Compaq had 27.6 per cent. By volume, figures for the seven largest European national mar- kets over the same period L showed that Toshiba had 47.5 i per cent, Compaq had 19 per cent - down from 39 per cent last year - while Commodore had 7.5 per cent. The impact of increased com- petition has been slowing reve- nue growth as widespread dis- counting takes hold throughout-the market.' \"There's overcapacity in the market,\" says Mike Daly at Grid Computer. \"Manufactur- ers with high costs are having to dump products to maintain market share.\" Certainly, European street prices have fallen as buyers have proved able to negotiate significant discounts from deal- ers even on highly specified machines with 386sx chips. Similarly, large corporate cli- i ents have been able to obtain highly attractive bulk pack- i ages. Meanwhile, in the US [ there has been a well-publi- 1 cised price war which started when Compaq announced price cuts. I One of the main conse- quences of the European price war is that distributers are now bracing themselves for cuts in the margin offered by manufacturers. Toshiba, for i example, is negotiating with its distributors to cut the dealer discount scheme rate from 43 per cent to 30 per cent, accord- ing to Mr Heinz Kraus, senior manager of product marketing at Toshiba Europe. The weaker retailers are to be weeded out, while those more efficient operators will be able to prosper with lower mar- gins, says Mr Gian-Carlo Bisone, vice-president of mar- keting for Compaq Europe. He expects \"superstores\" such as those already developed in the US to emerge in Europe next year. These specialist com- puter shops will offer easy-to- configure products off the shelf, with limited support, in a similar way to department stores. In the meantime, leading vendors, such as Toshiba, plan to distinguish their products from the clone manufacturers in two ways, explains Mr Kraus. The first is to continue to improve the performance of the machines. Such improve- ments include: m Colour screens - described by Mr Bisone as the last ele- ment that distinguishes note- books from desktops. These should start selling in increas- ing numbers from next year. A number of companies are working on thin film transistor (TFT) technology which should provide excellent contrast, even in poor light. m Improved battery perfor- mance. Toshiba has started using nickel-hydride power- packs which the company says more than a third longer than traditional nickel-cad- mium batteries. It claims the new batteries are also more environmentally friendly because they do not use cad- mium. * Weight. A number of compa- nies are developing- new printed circuit boarlds with reduced number of compo- nents, as well as new light but strong packaging materials to reduce the strain on users' muscles. The other method of differ- entiating products is to make the products customer-driven, according to Mr Kraus at Tosh- iba. \"For years everyone has been talking about the big shake-out,\" he says. \"Well now it's happening. Only those large enough or able to adjust their products for particular markets will be able to sur- vive.\" A number of vendors such as Toshiba and Grid are trying to develop a service to provide integrated solutions for compa- nies. Toshiba, for example, is planning to develop digital video interactive technology for its machines so they can be used for technical training and financial services presenta- tions. The company has had a number of seminars with potential customers to see what their needs are before they even develop the product. Toshiba has also discovered a need for security features on the machines. Lost or stolen machines can be a security risk - as the British armed forces discovered when they lost a portable containing the United Nations' battle plans for the liberation of Kuwait. The company is developing an access control system and an encryption system for the hard-disk. Meanwhile, ever-increasing numbers of jet-delayed busi- nessmen can be seen in Euro- pean airports writing reports on their laptops or fiddling with databases as they wait for flights. On the other hand, if they seem unwilling to let you see the screens, it may not be because the data is particularly confidential, but that they're embarrassed to be playing computer games. Well, they're better than Robert Ludlum novels.",
