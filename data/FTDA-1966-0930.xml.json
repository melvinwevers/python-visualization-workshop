   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspondent The Government is holding its hand on the activatlin of Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act-whichl wold protect certain eployers against legal actions arisig from the wages freee-ntil it sees how other employers and unions react to yesterday' Court judgment on the Thorn Electrical Industries case. Thorn stated last night that it was considering an appeal against the judgment, in which Judge Granville Smith at Edmonton County Court held that a company could not, because of the pay standstill, refuse to pay wage increases already agreed. The Government wants to avoid invoking its powers of compulsion and will only activate Part IV if it is con- vinced that it is essential to bring employers under its legal umbrella. Last night Ministers believed that this stage had not yet been reached. But they will be watching the industrial scene closely for any signs that yesterday's judgment has weakened the resolution of other employers, or has en couraged other unions to resort to the Courts. Time for Deciding on Appeal The Government; hopes that in dustry will keep its head and the unions hold back at least until it is known whether Thorn intends to appeal. Yesterday the judge granted a stay of execution which gives the company 21 days in which to decide. Immediately notice to appeal is given, if it is, the defendants must apply to the Court to expedite the hearing. The Cabinet, wnicn discussed the situation yesterday while the case was still being heard. natur ally hopes that it alt continue to reserve its .postion-,ro, as long P possib ' arly durf nex week's trw p\"CoMlft ence at Brighton . If it were forced by events to activate Part IV next week. the Government knows that there would be a real risk of its prices and incomes policy being resound ingly voted down bY the conference -however hard it might try to lay the blame on Mr Clive Jenkins. the Left-wing general secretary of the union which brought yester day's action, the Association of Supervisory Staffs. Executives and Technicians. Ministers Reluctant to Move But the situation is fraught with imponderables - including the result of a union action against Birmingham Corporation-and Ministers are reluctant to sav how Ions they may be able to put on ither decision Indeed, last nighi some of them were sheltering bi hind the assertion that as the Thorn case is still sub ludlce they coul- -y nothing about Part IV. even in The most that the highest .overnment sources will venture is that no decision on Part IV Is In view in the near future, and that f it il activated there would first be full consultation with both side- of industry They would not even confirm that a decision could hb ruled out for next week, However, they made it clear that if the Thorn case is still sub luidiv then. Ministers at the party confer. ence will not comment on the case in their speeches-a useful means presumably of taking some of the heat out of the debate on incomes policy But it is understood that the Cabinet has decided certain broad principles. The first, and most important, is that if Part IV has to be activated it is not intended- at least at the moment-to use all its powers. Ministers believe that only Clasie 30, would have to be used. and that the other clauses, empowering Ministers to fix speci- fled wage and price levels by statu- tory Order. would . remain in reserve. Clause 30 would effectively pror tect certain employers from certain union actions for breach of con- tract. But according to the Government's legal advisers, the extent of protection is likely to be limited. They tlae-the view that tbewostding of'luae0 @innd l fles only those qmployers wth activated .; *.-. - Building and Civil Engineering For example, if: activation wer to take place next Monday, this would seem Jo protect the build. ing and civil engineering employers, who have an agreement to pay their I m, workers an increase on November 7. But no protection would be given to the many. employers (including Thorn, and Bristol Siddeley) whose agreements were to give wage rises on dates during the past nine weeks. Other employers in this \"un protected\" category-unless the Courts ruled othrwise--would seem to include the electrical con tractors, municipal bus undertak ings, wholesale grocer, and poe slblv the Gas Council, the Railways Board and the local authorities All these employers have refused to pay wage increases due under agreements with opertive dates before to-day.

Mr. Smith would not agree, because he wanted a \"brakinm mechanism\" by which more White seats could be created as soon as the Africans were near a majority, The other main sticking point during the Salisbury talks was on the manner in which Mr. Smith should return to legality. Mr. Bowden wanted a transition which would begin with Mr. Smith going to the Governor and renouncing UDI, while Mr. Smith was only prepared to end by taking this ste. keeping himself firmly in the saddle in the meantime, Both sides acknowledge that, whatever the Commpnwealth Con. ferenoe may think, the frst step would have to be an informal agreement between the British Government and Mr. Smith on a modified 1961 Constitution, Mr Bowden's scenarlo Mr, mh would then urnder authority to th 2ov rnor an ctlons would ho led.

However, in the meantime it is the building and civil engineering business that has to provide the profits and this C it is managing to do with con- siderable success compared with Laing. Profits before tax in the first half have dipped only a Â£100.000 to Â£2.7m. despite the bad weather and rising costs. However with sales of houses to c private buyers falling off the question arises whether Wimpey can sell another 25.500 units this year, including those built for i local authorities. The answer is I positive for the simple reason that a cushion has been produced in the first half to offset the fall in I the current six months. Nor can there by any doubt of the impor- c tance of housebuilding to Wimpey. r Last year profit margins were 4% per cent. before tax on group sales of Â£150m. Since it is likely the margins vary little between housebuilding and the rest of the business and the average price of r a Wimpev house is probably rather r over Â£3.000, the housebuilding side must have contributed a half or more of group profits. The remainder, therefore, largely came from the civil engineering business ar home and abroad, which ap vet is still not being isqueeed. The upshot for the year, there fore could be 'a relatively slight dip in profits before tax-SET willt Sprobably cost.over Â£500.000-and a rather greater drop in earnings, ex-investment allowances for the first time. A drop of say a tenth/ before tax could produce earnings' of 46 per cent.. making the pros-' pective ple ratio 11.6 times at 27s. Wimpey's yield remains minuscule. as ever, but there is nothing wrong with the p/e ratio, which for once t really does mean the famous hidden property interests are in for nothina See also Page ' United Glass United Glass's half-year state- ment tells a sorry tale. Sales are up from Â£15.6m. to Â£17m., less than r expected thanks to the drop In U.K. consumption of gin and whisky, but margins are well down. Taken with a disastrous six months from plastic containers, which , managed to lose Â£180,000 on a . turnover of around Â£500,000. and a sharp rise in financing charges i profits before tax are only Â£286,000 against Â£584,000. The dis- appearance of the interim dividepd, I therefore, is hardly surprising even ) though the second half is going to I improve on the 1965 performance. 1 This is a relief, but on a full tax [ charge profits before tax of say . Â£750,000 against Â£1.lm. would Ionly provide earnings of just over 5 per cent. United Glass is hard up against its borrowing limits at the moment what with the new factory at St. Helen's and royalty payments to Owens-Illinois at the Srate of Â£300,000 a year. It can- not fund any more debt and can I hardly make a rights issue so the Sconclusion seems to be that the dividend for the year is unlikely s to exceed 5 per cent. unless pros- c pects for 1967 perk up consider- ably. At 7s 4Yd, therefore, the 1 shares are firmly counting on a quick recovery, for yield on even a t 10 per cent. dividend would be Sonly 6.8 per cent. S It is a measure of United Glass's failure to set its house in order, and above all to integrate Key which it bought for some Â£7m. back in 1962. that there is plenty of scope for higher profits even with the economy on its knees. If plastic containers cannot be made profitable then irritating as Rock- s ware's success here must be, rUnited will have to cut back cuth- I lessly. Secondly the decision to t close the Charlton factory will Sknock something like Â£800,000 off Slabour costs without affecting overall capacity. Thirdly there appears to be more room for cost reductions by re-jigging the existing production pattern, even before Staking account of what St. Helen's Swill do. Finally with Owens- SIllinois holding a tenth of the equity the pressure to produce r results will now be there in a big way. e See also Page 17 Scottish TV p Once corpqtion tax was set at 40 per Zcnt; it was nearly. afore- Sgone Oicllusibn that Scottsh TV t would pay the-32Ã½ per oentci rate Sguarantded by the Thomson d Ornisation.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commoditie Editor COPPER PRICES on the London Metal Exchange surged ahead yes- terday in the face of reports that copper production would be cut back throughout the Zambian Copperbelt next week-and that the U.S. Anaconda Sales Company had declared force majeure on domestic shipments from October onwards. Anaconda's action was taken because of the strike at Inspiration Consolidated Copper. which pro- duces 26 per cent. of the copper sold in the U.S. by Anaconda. In the event, cash wirebars gained Â£17 10s to Â£457 a ton on the LME. and three months wire- bars put on Â£16 to Â£453 10s. This is a rise of Â£45 and Â£43 a ton respectively in the last four days. Although the news from Ana- conda is serious enough, and may lead to increased U.S. buying on the LME. the main attention is focused on the Zambian Copper- belt. Informed sources close to the situation have little doubt that an announcement will be made next week to the effect that pro- duction throughout the Copperbelt will have to be cut back because of the serious shortage of coal needed to operate the smelters. In London yesterday, spokesmen for the two large Zambian mining groups-Roan Selection Trust and the Anglo American Corporation-bad no comment to make. However, a spokesman for Anglo in Lusaka said that Zambia's coal stocks are very low, and that \"a close watch\" was being kept on the position. It is pointed out in Lusaka that tLe recent declaration of force maleaur by the two mining groupe-a- legal provision warning that. compames may be unable to fulfl ontracts-- was not connected .with the coal situation. The declaratlo was made because of recent strikes on the Copperbet. One way or another, it is difficult to foresee anything but a further firming up of copper prices in the near future. Meanwhile Reuter reports from Tokyo that the Japanese Ministry of Trade said it would continue the present embargo of copper products. hcause prospects for the world cop- per supply position were still uncertain. The ban imposed last October covers exports of copper products such as ingots, alloy ingots and unprocessed wires and cables. N. NIGERIAN TIN DELIVERY STOPPED LAGOS. Sept. 29. TIN DELIVERIES to the British- owned smelting company in the mninin tovn of Jos. Northern Nigera, have been suspended inde. finitely because of railway transport difficulties. official reports reaching here said to.day. The reports said the Makeri Tin Smelting Company, a subsidiary of Consolidated Tin Smelters of Britain. imposed a force maleure on tin. ore deliveries last Tuesday following the suspension of long-distance train ser- vices between the north and south.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent GENEVA. Seat. 29. THE POSSIBLE renewal of the GATT Long-Term Arrangement for the international trade in cotton textiles will be considered in bi-lateral and multi-lateral talks. during the next three months, a GATT spokesman said here to-day. The 29-nation GATT Cotton Textiles Committee concluded its annual review of the five-year agreement to-day, and decided to meet again on November 28, for further consideration of the future of the LTA, when it expires at the end of September next year. Between now and the next Com- mittee session a series of bilateral discussions and negotiations will take place between importing and export- ing countries adhering to the Arrange- ment. The purpose of these talks. accord- ing to Mr. Eric Wyndbam White. GATT Director-General and com- mittee chairman, is \"to determine the conditions in which the Arrangement would operate in the event of its renewal. An American spokesman said the U.S.. which has already been en. gaged in bilateral talks with about 10 producing countries, was \"optimistic\" about the eventual renewal of the LTA. Exporting countries repeated their criticism of the LTA. claiming it has fallen short of their hopes for trade expansion in cotton textiles. The restrictive global import scheme intro- duced by Britain this year. and the low level of imports by the European Economic Community were criticised in particular. FOOD PRICES STEADY There was little movement in food prices during the week ended Sep. tember 29. Bacon, butter, cheese. eggs and meat were at much the same level as in the previous week.

A REDUCTION in the time from the birth of pigs to slaughter and the production of much needed good-quality edible protein, both achievements.due to applied biolo gical research, were among the topics discussed yesterday at a sym. posium held in London by the Institute of Biology. . Speaking on the impact of manu- facturing industry on agricultural rimary production Mr. Andrew . Ashby of Unilever showed that the number of days required to produce a pig of 260 Ibs live weight has fallen in nine years from 230 to 213 days. By 1970. because of special breeding experiments by a manufacturer of feed stuffs, it should be down to. 200 days. At the same time the proportion of lean should rise to 41 per cent., compared with 38% per cent. last year. Symba Yeast The protein-from-starch achieve- ment was described by Mr. M. Tveit of the Swedish Sugar Corporation, which has developed the Symba-yeast process by whlCi two moulds break down starch to sugar and feed on this. Using tapioca as raw material Mr. Tveit argued that a flow rate of 15 cubic metres an hour would yield some 2,500 to 2,800 tons of cell mass of yeast, abouts half of it protein. Such yeast could be worth S230 a ton and the processing would cost $80, leaving $150 for the cost of the starch. But the European price is about $50 a ton, thus leaving a profit of $100 per ton of yeast. Mr. Tveit further argued that the price of tapioca being much less in tropical countries industries aiming at exploiting the international market for dry yeast \"might well critically examine the Symba process.\" Sugar Beet Harvest Mr. Ashby also foreicst the com. plete mechanisation of the sugar beet crop if the results of current research proved successful after the present field trials. Research has produced beet seed with one germ. thus cutting out multiple plants from one seed and eradicatng hand-hoeing. The symposIum, on Biology and the Manufacturing Industries, con- tinues to-day with sessions on biology and the consumer and the role of biologists in lndustry.",

   "text_content" : "By a Correspoadentg AUSTRALIA is to extend its per- manent rice-growing area. which has formerly been pegged, by many thousands of acres. This is the effect of a decision taken this week at a conference in Sydney repre- senting rice-growers. NSW State Government. and land-use and irri- gation authorities. The exact acreage involved has not been announced, but Australia's rice crop is produced by more than 2.000 farmers and they are all be- ing offered a substantial addition to their present acreage. The decision now confers full growing rights on areas where rice has been produced for some time on a temporary basis. This was so that their suitability for perma- nent rice culture could be studied. in terms of factors like soil fertility behaviour under prolonged frriga- tion. The economic prospects for rice on world markets was also taken into account. This development follows the completion in London last week of plans to instal re-finishing equip- ment for Australian rice in London and the Midlands. This will per- mit grain which has deteriorated during the long journey from Aus. tralia to be restored to top condi- tion. One of the three sites needed has already been bought for this equip. ment. and construction will begin soon. The machinery to be used will cost more than Â£20.000. Britain's imports of Australian rice this year will total about 8.000 tons."

   "article_dc_title" : "Beef at the Crossroads",
   "text_content" : "By JOHN CHERRINGTON, Our Agricultural Correspondent UNDOUBTEDLY the reaion .wh be-i was given the maximum en- oouralment in the Naional Plan and aPthe following PYlc i a sew aled ndeflntly. Exports to Europe were boomin and no subsidy had been needed ver the lt 12 months to hno 41\" tees. Snl wqr athat 1 Govem t B ise the nanin it be Wu1 duced for three years. and that any increase in milk supplies con- sequent on an increase in the num- ber of caRVls rcir~l WQUd.. be allowe for iR i th SÃ½iBrd Quantity. The P4an and the Guarantee re- main. and the NFU. has just agreed a formula with the Ministry to cover the increased milk to be expected. but the market for beef has changed materially. Since the middle of June prices have suffered a severe fall. and so have the prices of the store cattle that farmers buy for next year's beef.. There i usually a price drop at this time of year as cattle come fat off th oastures. but this time the fall has been to the tune of nearly f2 a live cwt or Â£16 to Â£20 a head; last year in the same period the fall was no more than Isi a cwt. Wide Variation The farmer is. of course, cushioned against price falls by the workings of the guarantee. which makes the average return for all beef sold up to the guaranteed price. But averages, as I shall show. can conceal a wide variation in the prices received by the individual. A fall of this dimension is difficult to explain, as the total number of slaughterings of all classes of cattle. including cows and bulls at approximately 60.000 a week. is about the same as it was three months ago. and the same as it was last year. During the same neriod the price of Scotch and English beef at Smithfield Market has fallen by about 5d a pound: last year over the same period it was about 2d. It looks as though the rot started at the dead meat end. but it should be remembered that although Smith- feld prices are a fair indication of .he trade, the marketonly accounts for abo o' b of the meat land. In any lsh beef at llllower than they were at this time last year, but total beef supplies are up about 10 per cent. due toan increase in mported uP cluding those tatlB itrsh Republic. This irai ir Isobrbly balanced y a ideci e t' po'irk; lamb is roughly the same. This balance of meat supplies as compared with last year diposes of the argupeant that the bad frade is caused b'. horde d of desperate and credit squeezed farmers flood inS the market in their urgent need for ready cash. The most likely reason is the virtual disappearance of the export trade. which last year was taking about 2.000 head of cattle a week. mostly fat cows. and it was this demand, which only accounted for about 4 per cent. of total cattle sold. that kept the trade buoyant as long as it did The export of cattle was halted during the seamen's strike. but was already weakening then. because of the levies imposed by the EEC dountries; these have now been increased to such an extent that exporting is for the moment finished. Whether the trade will recover is uncertain: beef produc- tion in the EEC is rising and anv future imports may only be allowed in to cover seasonal short- ages. Standard Price However, none of this should in theory affect the British farmer directly, he is protected by the guarantee and has besides the beef cow and calf subsidies. However, these are only paid to the breeders. Most beef cattle are finished by specialist graziers whose return- are subject to the variations in- herent in the system of implement- ing the guarantees. This is deter mined by the average price of all grades of cattle sold in certain representative markets, and this umn is deducted from the standard price for the week. The standard price for the week ended September 18 was 170s a live cwt, but market prices for light if lib d*e.n 1W9 ! alve *1at 147. atlGttlt a Â»t difrence of Â£20 on an 8cwt-beast. ly The subsidy forecast to be paid by it the Ministry will be 156 7d a cwt ,n in each case The quality of the r. cattle at Ipswich might have been it a little higher, but the same n irratignal variation 0Qcur con- ei staitly. It is this uncertainty of c. return, coupled with the low preit- id ability of beef a the best of times is that is making farmers charv of investing in beef store cattle at the is momen., The credit squeeze has es little (b do' ith it. except to make e farmers generally conscious of the te financial uncertainty and the high d. cost of credit No reliable fanner d that I have heard of has been re- ly fused facilities for purchasing store se cattle. st 'd Side Line ;h or It is generally, and truly, said Sthat someone in the chain of pro- [d ducers of beef cattle, breeder, store d raiser or fattener loses money. s Latterly it has been the fattener. l who in many cases looks on beef C as a pleasant hobby, a side line not to be taken too seriously. Beef ,t cattle are the worst converters of Mt farm resources into human food. it There is no room for hobbies in the Spresent financial climate, so fat- I teners are not buying stores and v calves are not being reared. Two- e year old store cattle are down by t Â£20 a head and nearly 3,000 more calves are being slaughtered weekly than were at this time last year when confidence was high. in The sum of all this seems to be in that in the absence of a renewal lr of Continental demand on a per- Smanent basis, there is little scope f for an expansion of beef produc- r, tion in the U.K. without risking a \". massive fall in market prices. and iy a consequent increase in subsid, Is payments. But the future level of n- supplies may fall because of the It- drop in calves being reared to-day. r- But this prospective shortage could II be compensated for. as it is at in present, by imports denied access is to Europe. from Argentina, Austra- d lia and Yugoslavia, and by the great increase in cattle production Ã½k in Eire. All in all, organising the a supply of British beef would give It any nianner indioratinn"

PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S pro losal to suspend the 7 per cent. investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation on build- ings will have \"only a modest effect\" on the capital spending pro grammes of U.S. business accord ing to respondents in a National Industrial Conference Board sut- vey released to-day. Based on responses from 552 firms,\" NICB said \" it appears the S President's tax recommendation will produce no significant short term let-up in the demand for capital 'goods. T, f revjsions will have iicreasingly greater effect on actual capital spending as 1967 progresses but even so the reduc- tion from currently planned levels would not appear to top 3 per cent. in the second half of next .year.\" Over 90 per cent. of the companies surveyed said the proposed revisions would not spur them to, make cuts in their investment programmes during the rest of this year. This percentage slips to 82 per cent. in the first half of 1967 \"and 78 per cent. for the second half. NICB observes that since investment ordering could decline to. NEW YORK. Sept. 19. wards the end of next year in antici- pation of the reinstatement of tax incentives, capital spending may dis- play some sluggishness next year. As many companies added in their replies,\" NICB states, \"investment rates for a period as short as a year and a half are largely predetermined by the. necessity to complete pro- grammes which are already on stream. Many indicated that they would try to defer orders and contracts into 1968 in anticipation of the reinstate- ment of the investment tax incentives. From their quantitative estimates, however, it was evident that they now expect the amount of deferrals to be small relative to the total volume of planned investment.\" *"

Sept. 29. cota *op o e gfs I)ipraea treaspor( ft the in the U.S. Assign competition for the SST. ~Â·'Â·~ .; Â·Â·: A k f Be le dh k ' ANNOUNCING details to-day of the latest version of its proposed supersonic transport, Boeing said that the aircraft has been enlarged to carry up to 350 tourist class passengers. Its weight has also been raised to 675,000 lbs from the original 600,000 lbs previously so as to give it more range and enable it to meet airline operational requirements on important long range international routes. Boeing's new design, with changes in the aircraft's variable wing configuration and in the position of its engines, was first revealed when the company submitted its SST specifications to the Federal Avia- tion Agency. Lockheed Aircraft, which is engaged in the design competition with Boeing to build the American SST, has submitted specifications for an airliner that would weigh 550,000 lbs and carry up to 300 passengers or about as many as in earlier Boeing configurations. Boeing disclosed to-day that since 1958 when it first organised a continuous SST project it has spent more than $35m. of its own funds in SST research and develop- ment. It said that, if awarded a contract under present FAA schedule, it expects to have a prototype transport flying by late 1969. The SST is to enter airline service in the mid-1970s. The aerodynamically variable sweeo wing in the Boeing SST will permit it to operate as three aeroplanes in one-a supersonic transport capable of cruising at about 1,800 mph, a subsonic airliner, and a low-speed aircraft that exceeds take-off and landing performance of to-day's large Jets. The enlarged version of the Boeing SST will be able to seat seven pas- sengers abreast on double aisles simi- lar to those planned for the Boeing 747 \"jumbo\" jet. The aircraft will be built primarily of titanium alloy of 90 per cent. titanium, 6 per cent aluminium And 4 per cent. vanadium. Boeing plans to offer to build both its new enlarged version of the SST, and its previous standard size model. which has rather lower seating capacity. Reuter reports from Seattle that Boeing disclosed it has booked orders involving $200m. from unidentified airlines for 10 more 747 jet-liners. In Seattle, Mr. M. L. Pennell, Director of Boeing's supersonic air- liner programme, estimated that 500 SSTs would be in service by 1980. He said that if Boeing wins the design competition it will build from six to 10 SSTs a month. They would cost about $35.5m. each. Boeing predicts that direct operat- ing cost for its SST will be between Scent and I cent per passenger seat mile. By comparison the minmum for Boeing 747 will be about 6-10ths cent while operating cost for current 707s comes to about 1 3-lOths cent.",

He noted, for instance, that Britain's record on the labour front \"compares- favour. ably with most other countries,\" that \"output per head in British factories has been increasing in recent years at not far short of the rate in the U.S, 'and Canada,\" and that while Britain U.a. t. haPan r*s n a umrnti Aarwiit NEW YORK, Set. 29. this in turn is affected by defence and aid expenditures that account across the exchanges for \"a higher propor- tion of our GNP than for any other nation.\" Mr. Callaghan agreed that, in face of the present austerity programme, \"'it would not be surprising if there is a levelling off of industrial invest- ment in the present phase in some industries.\" And he agreed, in answer to questions following his speech, that British. imports are likely to bulge for two or three months after the import surcharge is removed at the end of November.

   "text_content" : "By Our California Correspondent ,80oMf COMPANES in the U.S. believe tihyhave found a new way to curb absenteeism-by offering trading stamps as awards to em- loyees for regular attendance. Be- htd the plan lies nbt a little sychology. The uempldÃ½yeir believe tht if thl man of the house can provide stamps to add to the col- ection which his wife gets from the. grocery store, she will be more likely to keep him up to scratch on his job. This, in fact, is merely a novel twist on the type of incentive pro- gramme which for some years has been used to stimulate salesmen in the U.S. The news is that now the same technique is being harnessed by employers to improve perform- ance in all branches of their businesses. Incentive programmes are now being used in America, for example, by road hauliers to increase the safety record of their drivers; factories, to cut down the working time lost by accidents; air- lines to raise their load factors; banks, to urge clerks to solicit new accounts: and in various other in- genious ways. Incentives for sales staff came first, no doubt, because the basis for the reward is comparatively easy to gear to targets. Most major corporations in the U.S. have adopted such programmes, some of them on a very large scale and with generous awards. Typical prizes for outstanding individual salesmen at the present time include colour television sets, refrigerators and other household appliances, sporting goods, type- writers. $300m. Gross Volume In addition, many large corpora- tions reward all their salesmen who reach set quotas with travel trips, accompanied by their wives, to popular resorts in the U.S., in the West Indies, and even to Europe and the Far East. Similar incentive programmes are in force for their distributors and dealers, to stimulate the sale of company products to the public. The provision of incentives for industry has become a big busi- ness, now estimated to gross about S300m. per annum. It also has produced specialist companies which develop incentive pro- granmmes for various types of client corporations. They charge fees for their services, but their chief source of profit is the prizes they undertake to supply for choice from attractive and bulky catalogues. They purchase these at wholesalers, and sell them -to companies at a mark-up which is, however, lower than that imposed by retailers of the same mer- chandise. Turnover Trebled since 1960 Largest of the incentive com- panies is the E. F. MacDonald, of Dayton, Ohio. and its chief com- petitor is Maritz, of St. Louis, Missouri. Some idea of the ex- pansion of the incentive business mi recent years may be gathered from the record of these two com- petitors. For example, revenues of Maritz, whose clients include 50 out of the top 60 corporations in America (with sales exceeding S1,000m. in 1965) are about 545m. per annum at the present time; which is 15 times more than in 1950. E. F. MacDonald, which is a public concern, reported sales of 5127.2m. for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1966. This is about double the company's volume of 1962, and three times that of 1960. MacDonald operates in Britain and in eight other countries on the Continent as well as in Australia. Most of the growth to date has come through expanding pro grammes for existing clients, and adding new clients in the sales in centive field. But the most signifi cant development of the recent past has been the diversification of services to include other branches of business. This may be illustrated by examples of programmes developed by the E. F. MacDonald Company. Thus, to stimulate the aircraft load factor and improve service, MacDonald devised for Eastern Airlines a \" Share in Excel lence\" campaign. The awards were made on a points basis, and any employee who scored the necessary number to qualify could choose his or her prize from a catalogue. For United California Bank the incentive firm developed a \" Yours For the Asking\" programme, de- signed to encourage officers and staff at the various branches to extend services to new and current customers. Prizes again consisted of merchandise. A more elaborate programme was worked out for Greater New York Mutual Insur- anuce to encourage the writing of more general liability insurance, other than car insurance, by its brokers and agents. The reward was a ten-day all-expense-paid trip to Paris and Rome for the winners and their wives. Incentives have also been applied -though with rather more in- genuity than was needed in the case of sales people-to the reduc- ing of industrial accidents and to increasing safety performance of all kinds. For example, MacDonald developed a Sights on Safety (SOS) programme for the American Trucking 'Association to recom- mend to its individual haulier members. This was so effective that some of the trucking com- panics report that they have saved more money on lorry insurance than the prize awards have cost them. Wives Combat Absenteeism Now experiments are being made to use incentives to reduce absen- teeism, with savings stamps among the prizes. In fact, the stamps are beginning to be recognized as a valuable tool for all incentive campaigns. The reason is that if the husband has a chance to win them at work while the wife collects them on the groceries she buys, then the family as a whole becomes involved in the project. Moreover, the woman of the house begins to make her voice felt about the husband's performance on the job. E. F. MacDonald, which also supplies trading stamps to super- markets and other retailers, makes increasing use of its Plaid Stamps as incentives in industrial pro- grammes. At the same time, Sperry and Hutchinson, the largest trading stamp company in the U.S., recently diversified into the employee incen- tive business, using its Green Stamps as awards. Though this branch of its operations contributed only about 3 per cent. of S and H's Stotal sales of some $330.6m. in 1965, the turnover was up 67 per cent. over the previous year, and is I expected to rise by another 40 per p cent. during 1966.",

Of the profit for the year approximately 62Y%is attributable to the Parent Company and its rail- way wagon repairing subsidiaries and the balance of 37%% to sub- sidiaries engaged in other engineer- ing activities. During the year an improved pension scheme has been adopted for the benefit of the staff and cur- rent pensions of Â£11,997 have been paid out of revenue. Taxation Corporation Tax has been pro- vided at 40 per cent. Under the provisions of the Fin- ance Act 1965 Iprome Tat deducted from dividends paid after 5th April 1966 has to be accounted for to the Inland Revenue subject to any relief which may be avail- able under the transitional pro- visions. Whilst the Company has retained the Income Tax deducted from both Preference and Ordinary dividends paid during the year ended 5th April 1966. the Income Tax amounting to Â£2,578 deducted from the Preference Dividend paid on 31st May 1966 and Â£140,716 deducted from the Ordinary divi- dend paid on the 30th July 1966, will have to be accounted for to the Inland Revenue. The total tax payable by the Company and ifs shareholders therefore amounts to Â£514.600. Had the new system of taxation been fully operative the total tax payable by the Company and its shareholders would have been Â£587.536 representing 64.28% of the profit compared with 57.13% last year, and the amount of profit retained and added to the un- appropriated profit of the year would have been reduced by Â£72,936 to Â£35.879. Balance Sheet The buildings. plant and machinery and equipment have been well maintained throughout the Group and provision has been made for, ahl necessary repairs pending or in abeyance. As 31st March 1966 there was an excess of Current Assets over Current Liabilities of Â£1,674,546 after making provision for the estimated liability to Corporation Tax due 1st January 1967 amount- incg t Â£362.259, The minority interest in Handy Angle Limited consisting of 50.000 B Shares of Â£1 each fully paid has been purchased during the year in consideration of the allotment to the vendor of 140.000 Ordinary Shares of 5s each credited as fully paid in Wagon Renairs Limited ranking for dividends payable in respect of the year ended 31st March 1966, Link St Limited (formerly Handy Angle Limited) The name of this Company was changed on the 7th July 1966 to 'Link 51 Limited' to mark the extension and diversification of its activities, which now include the proddction and marketing of slotted angle, cold rolled steel strip, ndustrial plastics and heavy duty steel adjustable racking and the marketing of a range of industrial and commerilal nroducts, The divisions handnlln t\"ese activities Include HandyAngle, Steel of Staffls Link 51 PlastTc, Roltlels Syst*ms L.Sk 51 Materials Handline and Ereoto, Link 51 Limited also orovldes an international storaee and materials handling technlcal service to industry and commerce.

In 1960 the Company diversified its activities and is now the largest steel stockholding organisation in Ireland and handles a comprehen- sive range of structural and engineering steel for all industries. The net profit for the year ended 31st March 1966 after deducting all charges except taxation and excluding capital and non-recurring profits was Â£79,741 and the value of the net assets at the 31st March 1966, based on book values. was Â£161,997. A new rod decoiling and bar bending plant has been installed since the end of the financial year and, with the aid of the financial assistance which Wagon Repairs Limited is-in a position to provide, your Directors believe that the business of Gambles is capable of further development. Tradig CoAdYls During the fiancial year 1965/ 1966 the workshops and depots of the Parent Company and its rail- way wagon repairtg subsidiary Companies'.have maihtained maxi- mum output limited only by the availability of ski'ed labour which, in this heavy yet pecialised trade, is.in very, short supply.. For the past trading year te Value of turn- over arisinga from the repair and overhauling of railway wagons and tank cars, and fr6m our foundries and manufacturing departments, exceeded the figures for the pre- vious year. Increased costs outside the control of the management- National Insurance, Engineering Training Levy, Gas and Electricity costs, etc.-have reduced profit margins: nevertheless, your Board consider the results of the Group's principal business, during a difficult trading period, to be satisfactory. Despite our endeavours to attract more labour to our industry, the recruitment of men, youths or boys is a most frustrating and difficult problem, added to which is the worry of the continual erosion of our basic force of long-serving skilled employees who are per- suaded to change their occupation by employers of labour engaged in cleaner, less skilled but perhaps more glamorous industries. In a labour market which is already overheated, such tactics can only add another twist to the upward spiral of wages costs without achieving a commensurate increase in real and worthwhile produc- tivity. The Bolt & Nut Co. (Tipton) Ltd. and the Steel Services Co. Ltd. have again made a satisfactory con- tribution to the profits of the Group. Thanks to Employees Once again we have to record our appreciation of the excellent relations throughout the Group with our employees who. by their co-operation. have enabled the Company to maintain its leading position in the industry.

   "article_dc_title" : "Bayerische Motoren Werke Ag",
   "text_content" : "The Annual General Meeting of BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG was held in Munich on July 8, 1966, and the following are details of the repon for '196 presented by the Board of Direo- tors : Review For BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE 1965 was a successful business year, with production and sales continuing to expand strongly. The company built 63,491 cars, 15.9 per cent more than in 1964, and thus achieved the steepest production rise among German car manufacturers. This fact also provided proof of the popularity of BMW models among the car buying public. Taking com- plate and knocked down units together, the company produced 6,709 vehicles, compared with 61,766 in the previous year. These figures do not, however, convey a true picture of the value increase in output, since only 9,070 units were made of the 700 series, compared with 23,661 pre- viously, while output of the higher priced \"New Class\" models rose to 58,524 from 37,823. New Coupe models BMW 2000 CS and CA were introduced at the 1965 Frankfurt International Motor Show and went into series production towards the end of the year. The 3200 CS coupe was phased out. Motor cycle pro- duction was reduced to 7.118 machines from 9,043 in 1964. Turnover Turnover rose in 1965 to DM 590.7m. or by 15 per cent. For vehicle sales alone, the in- crease amounted to 19 per cent. because in 1964 aircraft and indus- trial engine manufacture still pro- duced a turnover of DM 33.6m.- and this declined to DM 1.9m. in 1965. The comparable turnover per employee excluding sales branches improved to DM 56,200 from DM 49,900 in the previous year. The export share of turnover went up to 37.7 per cent from 33.9 per cent. Including c.k.d vehicles, 28,984 cars were shipped abroad, comprising 21,706 \"New Class\" models, 7,272 cars of the 700 series and six large coupds. Most of the business in motor cycles was again done abroad and 6.452 machines were exported out of total sales of 8.510. Sales Organization A series of measures were adopted to strengthen and expand the sales organization. In 1965. its reorganization to sell \"New Class\" models was continued and the range of models was further extended. Special efforts were con- centrated on the work of the field organization, sales - promotion schemes and, last not least, the advisory services rendered to dealers on technical and manage. ment matters. The after-sales- service and spare parts organiza- tions were improved. In May 1966, the new central spares depot with storage facilities, organiza- tional and administrative services capable of meeting all present-day needs, was inaugurated at the Milbertshofen works. The same objectives are being pursued abroad, The export organization in general and the dealerships in particular were strengthened. The after-sales service organization and spares supply facilities were developed and further improved. Motor Sport Striking successes achieved in 1965 with BMW cars in inter. national races and rallies included outright victories in the AvD Ntrburgring Trophy and Francor- champs 24-hour races, and in the Austrian Alpine, German and Tour de Luxemboura rallies, Private drivers of BMW cars continued an undiminished run of successes by gaining 27 outright victories, 162 class victories, 132 second and 93 third places while competing for the 1965 BMW Sporting Cup for Car Drivers, For the 12th time in quocesslon. BMW anined the world chamolonship for motor oycles with sidecoars and the com- pany's machines also won several Cerman motor cycling trophies. Inveetents Additions to fixed assets amounted in 1965 to DM 85.1m,. and in building projects prevented the investment target of app. DM 100m. from being reached. New manufacturing area was provided measuring 67,000 sq. metres. Major investments were also devoted to specialised machine tools and equipment for the manu- facture of the BMW coupds, the BMW 2000 limousine, and the BMW 2000 TI and the new BMW 1600 model. In 1966 it is intended to ipend app. DM 50m. left over from earlier investment plans and about DM 24m. under the 1966 programme, earmarked for re- placements, rationalisation and the extension of branches. Associated Compg les. In the year under review BMW sold to Maschinenfabrik Augsburg- Nimrnberg AG its holding in BMW Triebwerkbau GmbH, Munich- Allach (now called MAN Turbo- GmbH). On the other hand, the company acquired the entire capital of DM 5.4m. nominal in BMW Maschinenfabrik Spandau GmbH, Berlin-Spandau. BMW intends to utilise this firm's facilities as its Berlin works and to transfer there over the coming years the manu- facture of motor cycles, air-cooled engines and spare parts for certain models. To this end almost DM 25m. is scheduled to be in- vested in the Berlin works over the next few years. Abroad. BMW acquired a 30 per cent. holding in BMW Italia S.p.A., Verona, and thereby hopes to widen its market in Italy. Personnel At the end of 1965, BMW had 11,070 employees on its payroll, comprising 8,531 wage earners, 2,166 salaried staff and 373 appren- tices. The total compares with 10.818 at the end of 1964. The situation on the labour market again necessitated the recruitment of foreign workers to fill some vacancies. The wages and salary bill for the year rose to DM 112.9m. from DM 97.7m., reflect- ing several pay increases and the larger labour force. For the em- ployees extra living quarters were provided and welfare facilities were further improved. Prospects Business in the current year is expected to continue to develop favourably. However, the constant uptrend in costs, notably in the personnel sector, made an increase in selling prices inevitable; list prices for BMW models were raised by up to 4 per cent. from April, 1966. In the current year the company celebrated its 50th anniversary. The anniversary year saw the launching of three new models. designed to extend the \"New Class\" range, They are the BMW 2000, BMW 2000TI and the new BMW 1600. The company is convinced that they will meet good response. Profit and Capital Increase Net profit for the year totalled DM 9,199,635. It was accordingly proposed to distribute a dividend of 10 per cent. plus an anniversary bonus of 2 per cent. on the share capital of DM 75m.. together equivalent to DM 9m,, and to appropriate DM 199,635 as re- muneratlon for the Supervisory Board. At the beginning of 1965 the share capital was raised by SDM 12.381,000 to DM 75m. by the conversion of the last outstanding bonds of the 6 per cent, convertible bond loan Issued in 1958. In view of the company's strong turnover expansion from DM 294.8m. in 1962 to DM 590.7m. In 1965 and the expectation that this trend will continue in the current year, the Board recommended a further capital increase of DM 25m. to DM 100m, by a rrghts issue at par In the proportion of one to three the new shares to rank for half the 1966 dividend, The report, the accounts and the proposals put forward by the Board were adopted. # cRf. ]N i n.

Working profit from gold and profit from sales of uranium oxide were R8.471,000 and R3,979.000 respectively, compared with R7,436.000 and R5,061,000 for the previous year. The increase of R1,035,000 in gold profit was due mainly to further improvement in recovery grade, which at 9.79 dwt per ton milled was the highest yield obtained since mining commenced in the deep level area of the mine some six years ago. During the year an additional 104,000 tons were milled. Gold revenue. in- creased by 40 cents per ton milled compared with a rise of 9 cents per ton milled in gold working costs. Uranium profits decreased by RI.082,000 as a result of lower sales for the year. Profits from both gold and uranium include service fees received from Zandpan Gold Mining Company Limited in terms of the joint production arrangements with that Company. Production During the year under review the milling rate averaged 148,000 tons per month and a record throughput of 153,000 tons was achieved in May 1966. In accord- ance with arrangements made with the Zandpan Company, of which members were advised last year. Hartebeestfontein commenced using the Ellaton reduction plant in August 1966 to treat accumula- tions of development ore stored on surface and current development ore hoisted at No. 4 shaft. Some stope ore will also be treated in this plant which will be used by the Company for twelve to eighteeen months when the full capacity of the plant will be required by the Zandpan Com- pany. Ore is currently being delivered to the Ellaton plant by road transport at the rate of some 35.000 tons per month while ton- nage milled is slightly less than' this due to surface sorting, fIt Js planned that about 400,000 tons will be treated at Ellaton during the current financial year at a grade varying from 4.0 to 4.5 dwt per ton milled. Together with 150.000 tons per month to be milled at the Hartebeestfontein plant at an anticipated grade of 9.6 dwt per ton, it is estimated that for the current financial year a total of 180,000 tons per month will be milled at an average grade of about 8.7 dwt per ton. The shallow area of the mine provided 39 per cent of the ton- nage milled at a slightly higher grade than that obtained from the deep area. Some 84,000 tons of low grade ore mined from the deep area were stored on surface. Dur- ing the next two years the propor- tion of ore drawn from the shallow area is expected to be reduced to about 30 per cent followed by a sharp decline thereafter. Indic- tions are that channel widths in the remaining ground in the shallow area will be higher than average. Increased production from the No. 4 shaft section of the deep area, where ref channel widths are also treater than average, has had the effect of increasing the overall mine stoping width from 42.4 inches to 45.0 inches and at the same time decreasing the surface sorting rate from 32.1 per cent to 31.1 per cent during the past year. As channel widths In the remaining portion of the shallow area and In the No, 4 shaft section of the deep area are xpected to be higher than average further improvements In the grade of ore mined from these areas are unlikely. As anticipated, the uranium head value of ore sent for treat- ment at the joint plant declined to 0,68 Ib per ton compared with an average of 0,74 Ib per ton In the previous year but the recovery of uranium oxide was more than adequate to cover commitments. Working Costr Working costs per ton milled averaged R7.,? compared with R7,69 for the prvious year.

Of 13,600 feet sampled, 72 per cent. was payable at an average gold value of 490 inch-dwt and a uranium value of 28.1 inoah-b. Compared with the previous year, there were small decreases in both payability and gold values d and small increase in uranium vaues. In the No 4 shaft section of the deep area a total ofe 12a00 feet ad beetn sampled up to the end of June 1966, at an avenrage value of 401 inch-dwt and 26.1 inch-lb over a channel width of 38.3 inches. Of this footag, 73 per of 505 inch-dwt and 27.2 inch-lb. In the shallow area, where 600 feet were sampled, payability in- creased to 91 per cent and payable gold values to 497 inch-dwt over a channel width of 22.5 Inches. During the current year develop- ment will be cantinued in the vicinity of No. 5 shaft on station layout on 29 level, and n a series of reef raises to 25 level east of No. 5 shaft. Development will also be advanced in the vicinity of No. 4 shaft wher explatoatory headings are being driven towards the Mapaiskraal area. Shaft SiBkinK At No. 5 shaft all surface instal- lations, including the shaft collar, were completed by March 1966. Ground conditions restricted the sinking rate during the first 200 feet ut since then conditions have im- proved and normal progress has been achieved. By the end of June 1966 the shaft had been sunk to a depth of 382 feet below collar, and during the months of Julyand August a further 770 feet were sunk in dolomite. The shaft should reach its finaj depth of 6,600 feet by mid-1968. In order to obtain greater flexibility and increased ventilation capacity for what will ultimately be the deepest section of the mine, the sub-shft system will consist of separate upcast and downcast shafts designated as No. 5A and No. 5B sub-shafts.

A is estimato \" tht some R6uiu 00.000 rmWimAto b spent on the shaft system before it is completed by about the middle of 1969. Onr Reserve The total ore reserve at 30th June, 1966, was 7.029.000 tons at 8.11 dwt of gold and 0.53 Ib of uranium oxide per ton. Compared with the ore reserve at 30th June. 1965. the tonnage increased by 1,163,000 tons and the gold and uranium values decreased by 0.63 dwt and 0.06 Ib per ton, respe, tively. The main increase in ton nage was in the deep area where the total ore rmerve increased by 1,138.000 tons. Estimated stoping widths have increased by 4. )nche, to 47.2 inches in the shallow area and by 3.5 Inches to 46,3 inches in the deep area, The overall effect is an Increase in stoping width of 3,6 inches which accounts for approxi- mately 500,000 tons of the increase in ore reserve tonnale. The higher soping width has had an adverse effect on the gold and uranium ore reserve values, but the old' and uranium content per unit area, measured in Inch-dwt and Inch-lb,' has remained virtually unchanged at 377 and 24,8, respectivsly, com- pared with 375 and 25.3 In the previous year,. Tratment Plants In my review last year I outlined the arrangements made with the Zandpan Company for the pooling of uranium-bearing slimes, Exten. sions to the gold and uranium plants to increase their capacity to 200,000 tons per month each wer completed during March 1966, since when some 50,000 tons p;r month of mill pulp from Zandpan has been tronted in both plants, During thet year the Company agreed to sUply pyrlte to the sulphuric acid plant at the adjoin.

Of 13,600 feet sampled, 72 per cent. was payable at an average gold value of 490 inch-dwt and a uranium value of 28.1 inch-lb. Compared with the previous year, there were small decreases il both payability and gold values and a small increase in uranium values. In the No. 4 shaft section of the deep area a total of 12,700 feet had beean sampled up to the end of June 1966. at an average value of 401 inch-dwt and 26.1 inch-lb over a channel width of 38.3 inches. Of this footage, 73 per cent is payable at an average value of 505 inch-dwt and 27.2 inch-lb. In the shallow area, where 6,400 feet were sampled, payability in- creased to 91 per cent and payable gold values to 497 inch-dwt over a channel width of 22.5 inches. During the current year develop- ment will be continued in the vicinity of No. 5 shaft, on station layout on 29 level, and on a series of reef raises to 25 level east of No. 5 shaft. Development will also be advanced in the vicinity of No. 4 shaft where exploratory headings are being driven towards the Mapaiskraal area. Shaft Sinking At No. 5 shaft all surface instal- lations, including the shaft collar, were completed by March 1966. Ground conditions restricted the sinking rate during the first 200 feet but since then conditions have im- proved and normal progress has been achieved. By the end of June 1966 the shaft had been sunk to a depth of 382 feet below collar, and during the months of July and August a further 770 feet were sunk in dolomite. The shaft should reach its finaj depth of 6.600 feet by mid-1968. In order to obtain greater flexibility and increased ventilation capacity for what will ultimately be the deepest section of the mine, the sub-shaft system will consist of separate upcast and downcast shafts designated as No. SA and No. 5B sub-shafts. Work in preparation for the siqk- ing of these shafts has been started and full-scale sinking should begin early in 1969 after the lrtface shaft has been fuly equipped.

Royaltie in respect of additional uranium quotas aeqired in .961 have now been paid in full. Further interestfree loans will be received during the first half ofthe current financial year after which repayments commence. Repay ments of the loans obtained in 1955 and 1956 for the purpose of con- structing the uranium plant will be compl6ted In Deoember 1966. Caa Extpseidlien Capital expenditure during the year under review totalled R50,0000 including R1,517,000 on .old and uranium plant extensions. R1.069,000 on shaft sinking and equipment, and R469,000 on the pyrite plant. The shortfall of about R1,400,000 on the capital ex- penditure estimate published in December 1965 is due mainly to delayed sinking at No. 5 shaft to which I have already referred, and to a delay in the cormpletion of the pyrite plant. Expenditure on capital account during the current financial year is estimated at RS,300.000 includ- ing R2,100.000 for sinking and equipping operations and ancillary development at No. 5 shaft. RI,200,000 for extensions to the gold and uranium plants to a -capacity of 225,000 tons per month. R800,000 for completion of the pyrite flotation plant and RS00,000 on underground equipment Dividends In my review last year, the contribution to distributable profits to be expected from uraiium was explained in some detail. During the year under review uranium operations contributed 24 cents per share towards the amount earned for distribution. Taking into account the repayment of uranium interest-free 16ans during the first 'half of 1967 and the benefit from additional sales allocated to the joint plant arising mainly from in- creased service fee payments by Zandpan, it is now anticipated that some 17 cents per share will become available from this source during the 1966/67 financial year reducing to about -3 cents in the following year. Although working profit from gold, uranium and pyrite production for the current year is expected to increase by about R250,000 compared with the 1965/66 financial year, the higher rate of capital expenditure com- bined with the commencement of uranium interest-free loan repay- ments, will reduce the amount available for distribution and a further small reduction in the divi- dend rate may be expected. This concludes my review of the year's operations and I desire to place on record, your board's appreciation of the services rendered by the mine manager, Mr. G. S. de Villiers, and the employees on the mlpe as well as by the staff at both head office and the London office of the Company. 11 . 'pr y \"', ' \", V\" I",

   "text_content" : "S... From Our Own Correspondent * PARIS, Sept. 29. A fairy general pturn in French economic activity, ough wita Important sectoral variations, 1i likely g year, according to the latest Government forecasts atached to the 1967 Budget. For the economy as a whole the increase in production is expected to be a shade over 5 per cent., although for certain indus- tries, particularly in the transformation sector, the expansion rate may top 6 per cent. At the same time the Govern- ment has shown its intention of underpinning this first real recovery in investment spending by private firms for three years by announcing a 9 per cent. increase in investment by the nationalised industries neat year; Heavy Industry Expansion in the heavy industrial sector is unlikely to be more than average during 1966. A mild winter has helped to keep the increase in overall energy production at approximately the same level as last year, with the fall-off in coal 'consumption compensating to some extent for the higher demand for electricity and oil. While the general upturn in pro- ductive investment has naturally favoured machine-tool and other 'heavy equipment producers, and Sthe chemical industry as a whole seems set for another good year, the Government forecasters stress that French steelmakers have been living through difficult times along with their colleagues in the rest of the Common Market. On the other hapd. the position of the consumer industries appears to be rather less favourable. After a sharp .increase in production last year. motor-car manufacturers have been hard put to keep output at 1965 levels. particularly during recent months. And while some sections of the house- hold, electrical goods industry have __ Â· ----1 r~-~r Â·Â·Â·rlr~Â·r Â·Â·sÂ·u kept production expanding at the 10 per cent. annu'al rate customary for' some years now, radio and TV manu. facturers have been doing very much less well. New light is thrown on the back. ground to these more optimistic fore- casts for the French economy this year by the Government statisticians' dis- covery that the average family is likely to increase its purchases by 4.5 per cent.. against a rise of only 3.2 per cent. in 1965. The report confirms that the major soft spot in the French economy at the moment continues to be the con- struction industry. Various measures taken by the Government to revive private housebuildins are unlikely to take effect before 1967, and in the meantime the situation continues to deteriorate, notably in respect of low. cost accommodation. With reference to the nationalised industries' investment programme for 1967. the Government has now re- vealed that their total capital spending is to go up from Frs.8,763m. in 1966 to Frs.9,538m. Of this, 57 per cent., or Frs.5,340m., will have to be raised in long-term loans from the French public savings system and on the capital market. The chief increases will be for energy production, led by Gaz de France, which is to raise its capital spending programme from Frs.770m. this year to Frs.990tn. Next comes Electriciti de France, with an increase of Frs.210m. to Frs.4,810m. Overall expenditure on the public transport system is to go up from Frs.2,625m. this year to Frs.2,970m. in 1967, while the coal industry's capital budget will b t f = 138 C e cu rom rs. m. to r m."

For Rotterdam itself, the White Paper says that further growth after the completion of Europort (on the coast near the Hook of Holland), though .technically feasible. wultd be undesirable in view of the accompanying problems of air and water pollution and salt- water seepage. Amsterdam, too, would have only limited oppor- tunities for further extension after 1980. The Government will try to stimulate the development of sea ports in other parts of Holland.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent WASHINGTON, Sept. 29. There is now no political objection by France to Britain's entry into the Common MrJrt f I -- ----- The highest French officials stated categorically here to-day that if Britain were able to accept the Rome Treaty on the economic side, the French Government would not exercise a veto on political grounds, since \" political Europe,\" in the French view, \"no longer exists.\" - - - - The economic problems would be considerable-mainly on the agricultural side. There was no question of Britain's necessarily having to devalue sterling to enter EEC, but problems would certainly arise from the fact that, once she was a member, she could no longer devalue unilaterally. July Action M. Debre, French Minister of Economics and Finance, in a Press conference here this evening during the final stages of the WorJd Bank-IMF annual meeting, said the U.K.'s July action is \"precisely what would have been taken by France in the same circumstances.\" The measures were \"a demonstration of great political courage\" and \"fully cover what needs to be done.\" French officials confirmed that they feel considerably easier about the sterling situation. There was the faintest hint of softening in the French position on international monetary reform. M. Debr6 said if the rest of the Group of Te agreed on a \"con tingency plan\" for creation of new international reserve assets, France would \"look at it, observe and judge.\" What he called a \"moment of wisdom \"-when people realised the difficulties of the operation- would arrive at the time when the actual decision to create liquidity had to be taken. At this \"moment of truth.\" if the balance of pay- ments of the main deficit countries had then been in surplus for some time, \"we shall be the first to say yes.\" As M. Debrd said, France is proposing to take part in the con- tingency studies, though \"with some reservations.\" So. far it has seemed probable that France would simply refuse to accept any agreement setting out a plan for later use. Now it looks as if M. Debr6 has realised that there is a distinct possibility that France will find herself outvoted in the Group of Ten on the ques- tion of whether an agreed plan should be presented to the IMF and subsequently to Parliaments. He is therefore falling back on simple opposition to the actual activation of the scheme. \"Not Alone\" This is not, of course, to say that France will not do her best to proposingtruct to takhe preliminart in the ontia- tingeny studies, though \"withfrom M.

   "text_content" : "By Our Vienna Correspondent FOR THE FIRST time in post. war Austrian history, the country's t Budget is certain to have a smooth passage through Parliament. In I contrast to the past years, when t the autumn fight about budgetary < expenditures. used to split the t former,Coalition Government and t mot than once provoked its resig. sationcthe People's Party is now looking forwar confidently to the Budgetdebate. Its absolute majority suffices to defeat the amendments bound to be tabled by Se Socialists, who since last spring have been in opposition to the single Party Government of Chancellor Klaus. It is evident, however, that the young Finance Minister, Dr. Schmitz, is faced with strong oppo- sition within his own Party. He insists as before that the 1967 Budget (which in Austria coincides with the calendar year) should be balanced, and that the \" below the line \" deficit should not exceed the rate of debt redemption. Thus his draft Budget provides for expendi- ture of Sch.72,000m. (Â£1,000m.) while extraordinary expenditure - would reach only Sch.3,000m. His calculations, hbwever, have met with a barrage of criticism both in the farmters' lobby (Bauernbund) and among the repre- sentatives of the Christian- Socialist (OAAB) employees' organisations. Together with the pressure group of industry and commerce (Wirtschaftsbund), these are the three organisational pillars of the People's Party. The farmers and their spokesmen in the Party and Government object to the gradual dismantling of the exces- sively high food subsidies which, according to the plans of Dr. Schmitz, should save the Treasury this year some Sch.500m. The left wing of the Party is pleading for higher welfare expenditures. Should it achieve a political victory, the price would be in the region of Sch.1,000m. as a \"regular\" Budget deficit. Alto Adige The Budget is only one of the many serious problems facing Chancellor Klaus and his col- leagues. The two other major issues which are now at the centre of attention are also bound to have a strong impact on the domestic economy. The long dispute about the rights of the German-speak- ing minority of 240,000 in Alto Adige (South Tyrol) affects not only relations with Italy, but also Austria's chances of getting associated with the Common Mar- ket. Though officially repeatedly denied, it is a fact that an Austro- Italian compromise over South 5 I t9 1 bl d a y e t4 b ol c - t V 0 it ec ' en 6 th 4 m Â» fa \"Â· th * ar f J '. sis t tr< s- i- 9 *e B a 01 I- Â·e 1 e Ssc y gi s- rr e 4a * Tyrol would considerably improve a the Austrian position in Brussels.

The better perfor- s- mance this year will be primarily I I, due to construction, agriculture r. and transport. Industry, however, Y reports a downward trend and the e 4 per cent. growth this year is g about the same as in 1965. \" The reversal of trends in the i balance of payments has helped to I le consolidate monetary stability. At i a the same time a closer analysis re- ' veals that the deficit reflects not c only the effects of the liberalisa- i tion measures and new trends in 1 e capital movements but also a de- a g terioration of Austria's competitive I 1. position on world markets. In , ,r striking contrast to the first half *. of 1965 when there was a pay- a e ments surplus of Sch.193m. and c even more to the same period in , ,t 1964, when the surplus reached c. almost Sch.1.800m., the figures for < o the first half of 1966 show a deficit 1 ,t of Sch.1,300m. The overall pic- , o ture would have been even more g sombre, had it not been. for a r- \" statistical difference \" of , y Sch.2,000m., representing the time ,- lag between deliveries and payment 1 h in visible trade. With reserves amounting to Sch.31,000m. there is of course no anxiety. But the trade fgures show that the visible trade deficit jumped by 50 per cent. to Sch.9,230m. during the. first six months. At the same time the foreign currency intake from tourism, the main prop of the ser- vices account, grew only by 6 per cent. against 13 per cent last year and 24 per cent. in 1964. Thus the surplus from tourism is unlikely to be able to offset the mounting trade deficit this year. The organ of the industrialists, Industrie, spoke recently about an \"import explosion\" due to domes- tic cost inflation and demand pull. The General-Secretary of the People's Party, Herr Withalm, re- ferred to the danger of the \"English disease.\" The speeches and exhortations of Mr. Wilson are often quoted these days by the spokesmen of Government and in- dustry but not of course by the union leaders. Their spokesman, President Benya, frightened the economic community recently by announcing that the unions \"orien- tate \" towards feasible and not real growth. Wage Increases The time of wage increases at a yearly rate of 8 per cent. is gone in Austria. The GNP growth rate dropped from 6.5 per cent be- tween 1953-1960 to 4.2 per cent between 1960-1966. Unit costs during the last five years increased by 20 per cent. but the industrial price index only by 9 per cent, which clearly shows that the manu- facturers-for a variety of reasons -have not passed on the rising costs to the end-users and con- sumers. Though the debate between the \"expansionists\" and \"restric- tionists\" is still going on, the key to the chronic problem-growth versus stability-lies in structural changes and not in short-term credit injections. In the opinion of the leading economist, Professor Nem- schak, about one-third of the labour force is \"badly\" used, that is, in decaying branches. The projected reforms of the capital market, of the vast nation- alised sector (with a turnover of Sch.28,500m. and with 123,000 em- ployees), of subsidised housing and of agriculture could enable Austria to avoid the dreaded \"English disease.\" Mr. Wilson is in Gov- ernment and industrial circles, albeit not among the unions, an extremely popular figure, since, as Industrie put it. \"the shock from Britain has perhaps come at the right moment for us.\"",

He also revealed that Renault now had 5 per cent. of the German, Austrian and Swedish car markets. M. Dreyfus went on to emphasise the importance of developing trade with the East Bloc countries.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent PERTH, Sept 29. THE export to Australia of British capital goods is likely to increase more than that of consumer goods in the pattern of trade emerging between the two countries Mr. Douglas Jay, President of the Board of Trade, said in Perth to-day at the end of a 12-day Australian tour. \"I would guess also that perhaps a higher propor. tion of exports to the U.K. from Australia will be industrial raw materials, like minerals, rather than food.\" While he considered Australia would continue to supply some iron-ore to Britain, Mr. Jay said he felt it would never become a major source because suppliers like Norway and North Africa were much closer. Mt. Jay hit at two widely held misconceptions when he pointed out that British investment in Australia was bigger than America's and that Britain remained Australia's best trading partner-a position he felt the U.K. ould maintain. Pointing out that i verseas earnings were the limiting I actor in investment he said: 'British credit measures will tend t o make more investment possible ecause they will be dampening I own home demand and stimula I ing our overseas earnings, making possible to keep up a higher vel of overseas investment.\" Mr. Jay leaves with the mpression that Australia \"with s great natural resources now eing rapidly developed is one of he most important industrial and ading nations of the future.\" A different view The Australian news magazine, [he Bulletin, during the visit said: The most striking thing about Mr. Douglas Jay's visit to Australia s not that the President of the oard of Trade thinks it vorth while to visit the second-biggest :ustomer for Britain's exports, but hat never bef6re has a British trade Minister come here. If that o failure, has marked the depths of A British indifference to its major re market, then the current visit may e well mark the heights of panic it that has at last prompted the rr British to do their damndest to B increase their exports-even to the A extent of sending a Minister. tl \"The chances of Mr. Jay doing h much to improve Britain's level of h exports here look slim; commercial t< considerations have dominated Australia's importing pattern in recent times, and until Britain can establish any evident superiority in strictly commercial terms the marked trend away from buying British seems likely to continue. Above all, it may be useful for the Minister to establish at first hand why Britain's export effort has failed so badly in what used to be her major market.\"",

One of the biggest sales attacks over the next few months will be concentated on the Chieftain main battle tank. Costinl around Â£00,000 a time, the Chieftain is admittedly expensive, but it is re garded in British military circles as being the best tank available, superior to the Swedish \" S \" and the German Leopard tanks, while in the futurt lies intense compet- tion from the projected ne Ameran'orman MBT-70. Currently, export sales of the hieftain have been poor. So far the most promising customer is Holland, which needs to replace its ageing Centuriah tanks in the near future, but It is thought that a dunbher of other countries, throughout the world. particularly in the Middle East. might also be interested in the Chieftain.

One of the new military vehicles unveiled here to-day was the Shot- land Armoured Patrol Car, built by Short Bros. and Harland. of Belfast, in conjunction with Rover, which builds the vehicle's chassis and engine.

The vehicle is an ex- ample of the way in which Short Bros. is diversifying into general engineering to offset the decline in its big aircraft manufacturing activities. The Shorland is believed to have a sales potential of around 1,000 vehicles over the next few years. Some of the \"soft-skinned\" vehicles on show, such as the giant Antar transporters built by Trans- port Equipment (Thornycroft) could, it is felt, also be used in civilian roles throughout the world Virtually every major military \" and commercial vehicle builder in Britain was represented here to- day, including Alvis.

He was surprised, he said, that Britain should choose-to repeat this fiction that the Rhodesian Government was not competent to raise loans, especially after the High Court judgment three weeks ago which ruled that Mr. Smith's Government was in de facto control. ' The British Government's statement would maki no impression on investors, Mr. Wrathalj said. Both tomorrow's and next month's loans will almost certainly be raised without any dificulty, iven the excess liquidity in the Rhodpsan banking system at present. Both loans are to be used for financing maturing debt and Government development plans. In his budget in July, Mr. Wrathall envisaged raising Â£14m. in the current financial year, which ends next June. The further Â£4m. is likely to be raised early next year.

The decision to remain was made yesterday, before terrorists sped by the British Embassy resi- dence here in two cars and pumped eight bullets into the facade while Prince. Philip was inside. Flags Burned It was also made before six other terrorists broke into the British Con- sulate in Rosario (Argentina's second city) and burned a Union Jack, along with photographs of queen Elizabeth, Sir Winston Churchill and Queen Victoria. Last night a mob burned another Union Jack on fashionable Florida Street, It is remembered that Prince Philip's last visit to Argentina, four years ago, was cut short: he arrived in the week that the armed forces deposed President Arturo Frondizi, whose final protocol outing was a banquet given by Prince Philip in his honour at the Embassy residence.

Saturday. The team had gone to London to consult the company's Board on the results of the first round of talks, held in Damascus between September 10 and 17.

The Damascus daily al-Baath, mouthpiece of the ruling Basth Party, to-day printed an audit re- port which it said, had been pre- pared by the Syrian side to show that IPC had been miscalculating the profits on the pipeline since the supplementary agreement was signed in November, 1955.

A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that the Government waq waitine for a full report from Buenos Aires before deciding to take any action. However. one fact which has be- come embarrassingly clear is that in the event of a serious attack on the Falklands (which this week's incident admittedly was not) the islands would be quite unable to defend themselves. The local defence force consists of 30 volunteers armed with light weapons. There are no British regular forces on the island except for six marines whose task is to train the defence force. They are described officially as an \"advance party\" of HMS Protector. the antarctic patrol ship which makes an annual visit to the south Atlantic, but is now re- fitting in the U.K. The marines are commanded by a 24-year-old captain. The nearest sizeable British force to the Falklands is at Simonstown in South Africa. more than 4,000 miles away, where a Royal Navy frigate is based. The withdrawal of the frigate it however believed to he imminer, although the Simonstown base will remain open as ,,upplh ceni.e I n,, could mean that in the unlikely event on an attack on the Falklands the nearest available troops were in the Caribbean."

Representatives of some 70satons, including Princess Marinlr on behalf of the Queen, are: attending the independence celWeations of the new Republic of Botswana, but in many ways the most significant visitor is Dr. Hilgard Muller, the South African Foreign Minister. This is the first time South Africa has been represented at the independence of a Black African country, and' Dr. Muller's presence symbolises the close relations Sir Seretse Khama, President of Bots- wana, will be compelled to have with South Africa, at any rate in the economic sphere. The new Republic achieves independence under economic auspices which are almost as unpromising as could be Sir Seretse Khama imagined. The population of just over half a million (of whom only 4,000 are Europeans) can boast vir- tually no natural resources other than cattle. The overwhelmingly pastoral country has always been a poor one, but its plight has been greatly aggravated by five years of steadily worsening drought. The cattle herd has been reduced by about a third, to an estimated 900,000-odd head as a result of deaths and premature slaughterings. More than half the population is being kept alive by relief feeding schemes. Even without the extra headache of drought, development prospects would have been limited-by lack of money no less than of natural resources. The British Govern- rAMOOLA ZAMBIAjt ment has provided financial aid amounting to nearly Â£23m. over the past ten years, of which over Â£14m. has gone on balancing the Budget. Britain is committed to carry on with aid on this sort of scale for the next three years, and the hope is that it may be possible to step up the rate of spending on development slightly. The emphasis, apart from social projects like education and com- munity development, is bound to be on agriculture and on expand- ing beef output in particular. It is here that continued membership of the South African customs area will be essential, to ensure that the South African market remains open to Botswana's beef. In addition the Botswana economy receives something like Â£550,000 a year in remittances and deferred earnings from its citizens working as con- tract labourers in the South African mines. This compares with total export earnings of hardly more than Â£5m. a year. All this explains why despite his personal dislike of Apartheid-he is after all married to an English wife-President Seretse Khama will be anxious to remaip on good terms with Pretoria, a policy of which he has made no secret. For its part the South African Govern. ment would like to think that the emergence of Botswana as an inde- pendent State, soon to be followed by Lesotho (Basutoland) and later no doubt by Swaziland, can be made to fit into the pattern of separate development it envisages for Southern Africa. Whether this dream will materialise is another matter, since the degree of political freedom already enjoyed by Bots- wana's Africans far outstrips any- thing that has been held out for the citizens of the future Bantustans. However, the political develop- ment of the former protectorates is bound to lead to important changes in racial attitudes at the official level, a process that has already begun with Dr. Verwoerd's meeting with Prime Minister Leabua Johnathan of Basutoland in Pretoria shortly before his assassination. As for his relations with Mr. lan Smith's Rhodesia, Dr. Muller President Khama is likely to tread warily here too. There can hardly be any question of his formally recognising the Smith regime, but it is equally improbable that he will risk economic strangulation by blocking the free movement of goods from South Africa to Rhodesia along the railway line that passes through Botswana, and which is also the country's lifeline to the outside world.",

Because of worsening casualty experience and other adverse factors, marine underwriters in the major markets are adopting a much tougher attitude on premium rates for hull risks. This was made clear at toe open: council sessions of the Inter- national Union of Marine Insur- ances' annual conference here. Dr. H. P. Rogaar (Netherlands). the retiring President. said he had more confidence than a year ago in the prudence of many under- writers and so. in the more distant future, in profit-earning capacity. When ocean hull business was discussed, the British. Norwegian and German market delegations confirmed the tougher attitude on their part- particularly on renewal of risks, which are negotiated towards the year-end The other principal markets will un- doubtedly follow this lead. The report submitted by the British market said underwriting had shown a steady deterioration over the past five years, due not only to continuing increases in the cost of repairs but also to the yearly rise mn the number of total losses and major casualties. and the inadequacy of premium increases due to unrealstic tompeti- tion which was not limited to overseas competitors. During the past year the British market had suffered severe losses on drilling rigs. which were almost exclusively covered in Londoa Although premiums had been greatly increased it had yet to be proved that they were adequate. SThe market's formula for reneving hull policies bad recently been re. assessed. and it was hoped that the firmer attitude to results by under. writers would bring home to owners and crews the necessity of exercising the greatest possible care in claims avoidance. The new nrmident of the Union is Mr. H. C. Bilge (Norway)."

A top speed of 100 mph is claimed, some 10 mph faster than the previous 1.6-litre model. which is superseded. Acceleration is also much im- proved, with 60 mph attainable from standstill in just over 12 seconds compared with the 17 seconds of the smaller-engined Vitesse. Transmission is to the rear wheels via a larger. diaphragm-spring type clutch and fourpeed all-synchromesb gearbox. The chassis retains Its backbone girder and independent suspension to all four wheels. The front disc brakes have been increased in size.

What does this mean? The April. 1965, White Paper, in specifying a norm of 3-3% per cent defined it as the average rate of annual increase to be permitted in money incomes per head. It ex- plained that excepLional cases where increases above the norm were per- missible would have to be balanced by lower than average increases in other cases. You report (September 21) Mr. William Rodgers as saying: \"In future the norm must be . .. re. garded as the appropriate average for wage settlements, not the minimum starting point in nego- tiations.\" Are we therefore to conclude that in future those cases where an increase above the norm of zero is to be permitted (such as genuine productivity agreements) must be balanced by actual reductions in income in order to achieve the average of zero? This seems highly impractical, to say the least. It is to be hoped that the new cliteria now being formulated will clarify this point. Everyone accepts the need for a tough policy, but at the same time It must be one that makes sense, which a norm of zero does not. J. FalsmN. 17, Foxgrove Lane, Felixstowe, Suffolk.",

For the past seven years the French have successfully operated engineering clearing-houses for this type of information. They are called \"Bourses de Sous-Traitance\" or Sub-Contract Exchanges. The idea has since spread to other Continental countries. such as Belgium, Switzerland. Spain and Italy. Preliminary surveys are now being made in Greece and in Tur- kev.

Speaking about the future of industrialised building the autthor of the article.tates: \" but progress towards the system-built two-storey house. which most Britons would live in if given the choice, remains very limited.\" That statement is in direct contrast to the results of a recent survey into the public's house preferences carried out on behalf of this Federation by Social Surveys (Gallup Polls). It is ipteresting to obqerve from the poll that 64 per cent of the public prefer brick as the basic material for homes and that they have chosen brick because it meets the three principal requirements for a house-building material, namely, (i) that it is solid and durable. (ii) that it retains its value, and Viii) that it is inexpensive and easy to maintain. Concrete panels on which so many industrialised A' systems depend are favoured by only 4 per cent. Moreover. multi- storey dwellings are out; 41 per cent. of those interviewed in the poll said that if they were moving they would prefer to live in a bungalow. while 31 per cent. wanted detached houses. So that although it is true to say that most Britons if given a free choice would prefer to live in a single-storev or two-storey house they would opt for one built of brick. G. K.

   "text_content" : "-' , Financial Times Reporter Coastruction difficulties on the M4 motorway Brynglas tunnels in Wales have delayed completion by two years and added im. to the cost, but two of the viaduct failures on the Coldra-Crick section of the motorway have not added to the public expense. scw ,suriairsnc secuon or me mosorway nave nor aaase u This is stated by Mr. Cledwyn Hughes, Secretary of State for Wales, in a letter to Mr. Roy Hughes (Lab., Newport) who wrote to the Minister about delays and problems on the M4 west of the Severn Bridae. ' Mr. Roy Hughes expressed con- cern about the tunnels and struc- tures and also about the number of companies involved on road construction on the 181A-mile length of motorway which have failed to complete their contracts. These .have included Martin / Cowley on the Monmouth ap- proach road to the Severn Bridge. which has now been completed by Fitzpatrick and Son. It had been hoped that Coldra- Crick, which runs westwards from the: Monmouth approach road. would be completed by now buit it is unlikely to be opened this year, . This .i an important link to the Severn Bridge. Further west, on the Newport Bypass, .the motorway from Tredegar Park to Malpas is to open in January and from Malpas to Crick (which includes the tunnels) next March. Mr. Cledwyn Hughes explains in his letter that although the tunnels are short-l,150 feet--they have been driven through difficult ground with geological faults which were not revealed by pre contract boreholes. Special driving shields had to be developed which delayed work for several months. Following a fall in the tunnels last May, seven families were evacuated to hotels \"at public expense\" and .are in negotiation .with the district valuer for the sale of their.-homes. ,Where falls in the tunnels caused ground sub- sidence, voids have been filled and further subsidence is not expected. Mr. Cledwyn Hughes\" letter says that damage caused by the fall of ten main beams on the Coldra Via. duct on August 31 last was covered by insurance and no public expendi- ture was involved. \"Investigation showed that the collapse was caused by movement of the beams which the temporary support was unable to accommodate,\" he states. The cost of remedial work follow- ing one of the viaduct's main beams being crushed during stressing on August 31 this year will also \"not afll on public funds.\" \"The crush- ing was due to a small volume of defective concrete and as a result an outer beam has had to bereplaced and an inner beam is being repaired,\" asserts the letter. Cracking and spalling (chipping) of the concrete on the Caldicot- Caerwent Bridge, also on the Coldra- Crick section, were discovered on August 11, 1966. A short section of the bridge deck is being removed and \"as a safeguard to avoid any risk of a similar ,occurence, modifica- tions are being made to the. Ferry Cross4Dewstow overbridge. Liability for the cost of the ,remedial work is being investigated by the consulting engineers,s' An independent Investiga. tion-is being conducted: by the in surers.

The following are extracts from his circulated statement: Last November I remarked that an increase in the order of 25 per cent in group pre-tax profits could be looked forward to; the .results for the year show an increase of Â£15.092, equivalent to 27.8 per cent. Credit trading now accounts for almost one half of the group turnover and its contribution to group profits this year was over 50 per cent. It is anticipated that this trend will continue, as turn- over on this side of the group's activities is expanding quite satisfactorily. Owing to the change in the basis of company taxation, this year has not borne the full brunt of the additional burden of taxation which we will have to bear 'n future years. The tax deducted from the interim dividend of 2d. per share paid on 28th January, 1966, amounting to Â£6,800 approxi- mately, has been retained by tbei Company this year, although similar deductions will have to be paid over to the Inland Revenue in the future. But for these changes in taxation and the restraint im* posed on dividends it would have been prudent to recommend a final dividend of 2d. per share; instead a final Dividend of lid. per share is recommended, maintaming the total at 31d. per share. Whilst many difficulties beset us -the Selective Employment Tax alone will cost the group approxi- mately.Â£7.500 in a full year-I can look forward to another good report next year which will be for a period of fourteen months as it has been decided that a change in the accounting year to 31st March will be better administratively. It is anticipated that an interim report in respect of the first six months' trading will be issued within the next few weeks, and I feel sure that satisfactory progress will be shown. The report was adopted."

(Estate Management), F.R.I.C.S., P.A.I., Chairman, presiding. The following are points from his circulated statement: I am able to report an increase in the net profit of the Group before taxation to Â£100,056 after all charges including interest on building finance for the develop- ment programme have been paid. The devl6opments to which I referred last year have been com- pleted and are producing rents fully in accordance with expecta- tions. The shops and maisonettes at Farnborough are all leased with the exception of two units for which negotiations have just been concluded with one of the \"big five\" Banks. These developments were financed by Bank Loans and arrangements have been made for funding these loans on a long term basis which will in addition leave a surplus for financing a further project now planned. Despite the curtailment of mort- gage facilities for purchasers, trad. Ing profits have been very. satisfac- tory. This trading aspect of the Group's busindss is likely to be of increasing importance in the future due to the difficulty of building at current costs to let at economic rents. The Group has pqrchased a number of freeholds during the year and acquired the last remain. Ing minority interest in the subsi. diary companies. An Interim Dividend of 8 per cent (less tax) oh account of the year was paid last December and, In accordance with the forecast then made, the Directors now recommend a Final Dividend of 8! per cent (less tax). The report and accounts were adopted.",

Dr. Richard Russell moved to the town in 1754 aod made his fortune by prescribing sea water to drink as a cure for tat ills; he also laid the foundatics of Brighton's fortunes as a spa: the Prince Regent came 30years later to add the Pavilion and a, reputation for pleasure, and in 1841 the railway arrived from London, heralding Brighton's era of fastest growth and making it Britain's first seaside resort.

Not only are the factories conveniently close to SGatwick Airport and London but the Continent is just across the sea, and to move the point te se, and to prove the point a very successful Sussex- Normandy Fair has just ben hold in Brighton,. bringing a spate of export orders. An even greater surprise has been the success of Shoreham, a the second largest wine import- ing centre in Britain, having re- trade, and its competition has at last stimulated Newhaven, the Channel ferry port on the other side of Brighton, into life. Academic Success Although Brighton will never be known as an industrial town, it stands a good chance of estab. lishing itself as the academic equal of Oxford and Cambridge, in number of - students and appeal if notin traditions. There are 5,000 students in the town already, almost half at the University of Sussex, and the remainder in the Technical College, the Art Sbhool and the Teachers Tiaining College. In addition, there are numerous schools, of which Roedean and Brighton College have a national reputation. Tho new Rank enteitamlamr comphl In Chumrhll Squar.

Both industry and the colleges have a contribution to make to each other, and to the cultural life of Brighton. The contribu- tion of the holiday makers and the conference delegates is more one of solid cash. At a net ex- pense to the rates of Â£100,000 Brighton entertains over 7m. visitors and 100 conferences each year, which between them spend over Â£13m. The great majority of tourists come for the day, but the delegates are proving a great asset to the todi spending well and keeping the hotels busy throughout the year. A less tangible but equally dominating factor in Brightoni is the closeness of the town to London. The capital has tradi- tionally been the source of the' bulk of its trippers. To-day a much smaller but quite impor- tant exodus is in progress in the reverse direction. More and more people are renting flats or buying houses in Brighton and travelling to London to work. There are perhaps 5,000 such commuters already, and the speed of the rail service-many ~Â·(~LIÂ·~ ttl _Â·1( Â·Â· i _Â· Â· ~~ Â·I ~Â·Â·~Â·I _II trains take an hour-and the relative ease of the road journey, perhaps Ii hours, is encouraging this. development, especially among semi-retired people. Brighton has a very mobile population. Students stay a few years, workers in the catering industry perhaps just a few months. There is also a great deal of movement among pro- sessional and retired people. To meet this shifting demand for accdmmodation Brighton's pri- vate builders have concentrated on flats. Four tall towers are planned for the town centre;,and numerouslarge houses and small hotels have been converted into flits.- Limits Imposed Although many flats remainu empty for months or years they are st bconsidered a sound in- vestment, since just 50 per cent. occupancy can cover costs. But property developers in Brighton, as elsewhere, are suffering from the credit squeeze, and there is a surplus of empty accommo- dation. Houses priced below Â£5,000 are selling quite well, but lack of funds is putting a brake on transactions above Â£7,500. The lack of building space in the Brighton Council area has not only imposed limits on in- dustrial expansion but also made progress in office building slower than might be expected. Until the recent restrictions on office developments in the South-East, Brighton had many attractions for firms wanting tomove out of London. Quite a few had come to the area and rents, which had only been 17s 6d a square foot, are edginig towards 206; com- pared with the 100s in Central London this is still very cheap. Shop developments in Brighton Shave also' progressed- rather slowly, although when the Â£12m. Churchill Square project is com- pleted there will be space for another 100, as well'as for two department stores. Brighton began as a small fishing-village. To-day it seems to be turningits back on the sea. There are scarcely half a dozen fisitng boats left,..and the smells of the town are not seaweed and fish but curry :an 4.Cntinental coffee. There are now half a dozen Brightons'iand the huge housing estates on the outskirts of the town, the remaining Vic- torian terraces of Kemptown, and the peeling stucco of the less fashionable squares seem to have little in common with the sweep of the promenade with its 19th century hotels which could transport themselves smoothly to the plage at Monaco. Brighton even fails to have a recognisable heart: the coloured fountains near the Palace Pier and the splendour of the Pavi- lion are away from the main- stream of commerce and enter- tainment, and West Street, the direct road leading up from the sea, comes to an abrupt halt it the railway station. The scale of Brighton s small, but there is enough variety to, please most people, The Lanes, a mass of alleys which form the basis of old Brighton, may be more picturesque than grand, but grandeur is less fashionable than charm these days; and, despite its more diversified economy, Brighton still has plenty of charm.",

   "text_content" : "The holiday attractions of Brighton ae worth at least Â£ilm. to the town. That is the estimated expenditure of the 7m. people who visit Brighton each year. h addition, and of increhsingm importance, there is the. 2a-3 m. spent by the 10,000 deletes, and their wives, who attend conferences there. Brighton obviously stil has great appeal. Yet ther are many in the town who say the trade is not what it was; and they ar right. However, If the number of trippers arriving by cokah has halved in the pat decade, and fewer people now stay for a week, Brighton need not despair. It has not lost ground, rather it has altered course the better to meet the changed national holi- day pattern brought about by cheap travel abroad. Conference Trade The day tripper and the conference trade now form the basis of Brighton's.popularity as a resort. The vast hinterland of London and the South East, with a population of 20m., is drawn there by tradition, closeness and accessibility; once the driver is behind the wheel, with the inten- tion of having a day by the sea, many cars head instinctively for Brighton. The conference trade fills the hotels throughout most of the year so that the two largest, the Metropole and the Grand, are half-empty in July and August but booked solid during the remaining 10 months. The Metropole, which has incor- porated on its site seating accommodation for 6,000 people, including one exhibition hall which takes 3,000, is now handling bookings for 1970, and receiving inquiries for 1972. Bought by the AVP Group in 1960 with the aim of converting it into flats, the Metropole is largely geared for the conference trade, attracting custom with its ability to provide all conference facilities at a reduced inclusive charge. Of the 100 conferences Brighton eafronst, sbowing the faade of hotels on the left, the West Pier In the middle distance and the Palace Pier beyond. to be held in Brighton this-year 70 will take place at the Metro- pole. But there are plenty of alternative centres for large meetings. Last week the Liberals met at the Dome and next week the Labour Party will be the first customers for the new Rank ice rink development on the sea front. Not only conferences keep the hotels busy all year: as annual holidays lengthen it is becoming quite commonplace to take a few days at a British resort in the spring or autumn in addition to a summer trip to the Continent. Brighton gets a sub- stantial proportion of this trade; there are always Londoners dashing down to unwind for a few days in November or February. Although the traditional season may now have shrunk to a couple of months in high summer even the small hotels and boarding houses have their consolations. The number of people arriving for a protracted stay has fallen from im. to 350,000, and most.of these are over 45 and thrifty spenders, but the University of Sussex has more than filled the gap by directing hundreds of students into the empty guest rooms. Fifty small hotels and countless boarding houses take students for nine months of the year, and the University's summer term ends especially early to free the accommodation for the holiday- makers. There may be grumbles here and there and the occasional hotel closes, usually through en bad management or extrava- da gant charges, but generally the holiday trade is still prosperous. AVP is rebuilding one large .hotel on the front to open m the spring, there are rumours of another planned, for near the Palace Pier, and many hotels have enlarged their accommoda- tion, including the Grand at a cost of Â£50,000. The Selective Employment Tax, which will cost the Metropole Â£15,000 a year, has. been smoothly passed on in the form of higher charges, and has been balanced by the tightening of expenditure on overseas holidays. Brighton has already reaped one ironic advantage from this measure. The Travel Agents Confer- ence, due to gather in Rotter- dam in November, has been hit t The Lanes\" In the hea o Brkl,to Atique -& e '1 have et up shop nl the coaerted Aldhermn'o eeawls 18th-century Brilghthelautm by the Â£50 limit, and the 2,000 delegate willt now meet n Brighton. All these people spend money freely. It matters little that the Hippodrome, along with two other Brighton theatres, has closed down; that there is no demand at all for the summer shows so popular in Blackpool, and that the Council has lost money by presenting them. It does not matter, in fact, that the family seaside holiday is. in de- cline. Brighton can even weather a bad August Bank Holiday, as this year, when deckchair tak- ings were down from Â£3,000 to Â£1,000. Ideal Place The town can absorb these setbacks because a hot Satur- day in October will pack Brighton: because visitors will come miles to eat in the town's 600 restaurants; buy antiques in the Lanes; flock to the Pavilion, all through the year. Fewer holidaymakers pack their bags and consciously plan to go to Brighton, but faster communica- tions have brought it so close to the. capital that it is an. ideal place to visit regularly, to take as casually as a trip to the West End. Brighton may never have been the Londoner's playgroud, as Southend was and is, but it stands to benefit from the hew mobility of a more affluent and sophisticated society. It is a coe. mppolitan town which is redis. covering its identity in a cosmopolitan age.",

   "text_content" : "Brighton is in the middle of one of its occasional bursts of redevelopment, which has trans- formed it from a sedate town of Regency residences, through a period of rapid and uncontrolled growth after the arrival of the railway in 1841, to the mixed and tioinintpA natehwark of recent years, where some of the finest streets in the country rub shoul- ders with depressing slums. Brighton gives many faces to the world, and not all are inspiring. This summer the Council has set in motion precedures which should, in time, give the town plans for a new centre. Consul. tants will be appointed any day now, and up to Â£100,000 is to be spent on their report. In the meantime, East and West Sussex County Councils, and the appro. priate local authorities, are undertaking a Transportation and Land Use Survey covering the whole ars from Shoreham to Lancing, and there are a num. ber of private projects in hand, some of which are already be. ginning to change the appearance of the town. Development Plans By 1970 four towering blocks of fiats should dominate the Brighton shoreline. Two will be over 300 feet, and one of these, Sussex Heights, currently the tallest building in the county, is already there. It has been built by AVP which, since it acquired the Metropole Hotel, has been to the fore in Brighton's develop. ment plano. Apart from opening a casino and buying the West Pier in 1965, AVP s transform. ing the area around the Metro. pole site, and its most visible contribution here will be Sussex Heights, Two of the 11 fiats have already been leased at prices starting at Â£5,450 and Brighton is full of rumours of a possible buyer of the lease for the luxury penthouse flat, which at a reported Â£50,000, must be A vbw co tlhe Mew hln Miek ( late o ir beh*Ti the Hol Met vpo,. * ^ . \". 91 one of the costliest flats outside London. In a few years time Sussex Heights will'be joined by the thee skyscrapers of the Churchill Square development. Thir covers 16 acres in the centre of the town and is being built by Myton on council land. As well as over 300 flats, there will be offices, shops, department stores, pubs, a garage and a restaurant in the Â£10m. scheme, which should be completed by 1972. The entertainments complex on the site, operated by Rank and including a ballroom, bowling alley and ice rink, Is already opening for-very good-busi. ness. Sited on the corner where the main Brighton thoroughfare Joins the promenade the enter. talinents centre symbolises the new image of Brighton: \" When finishe It will have an 18 feet high 'coronet or crown' of pale gold anodised aluminium panels masking a ,massive steel roof which will gleam in the sun by day. At night lights from the windows of the 230.foot long Ice rini,will make it appQer that the vast roof with its golden crown is floating on light. This is becoming daily a more visible sight in Brighton, as are the office blocks and council flats rising slightly back from the front, and Sir Basil Spence's splendid architecture at Sussex University just outside the town. In theory the Skydeck, a 600-foot tower with a 400.foot mast to be built on the beach with a res. taurant at the top and dolphins leaping at ground level, Is equally certain to appear soon, for plan. ning permission has been granted, The tight flnancinl situation, however, seems to be holding back this startling Â£1.5m. plan. For the Marina, an even more grandiose development for the east side of the town, the prob- lems are not. only railing the money, estimated: at 4mn., but also securing' Government approval. The proposal, approved by the Council, is now before the Minister of Housing, out tis amoiious vision to transform Brighton into a sailing centre with accommodation for 2,000 boats, still has many hurdles to negotiate. Historical Interest There is enough building activity already in progress to ensure that Brighton will shock the visitor returning there after an absence of a few years, even if the more remote schemes, for the redeveloping of the Town Hall site, and a ring road around the town, are little more than declarations of intent. Whatever plans finally emerge for the new town centre after the consultants' report-ex- pected in about a year-the old character of Brighton, where it exists, will not be threatened. Over 1,500 buildings in the town are protected as being of historical Interest. The \"new\" Brighton must incorporate the best of the old, But in the longer term, the re- development of Brighton rests on boundary changes. Brighton is restricted in space, although the Council owns 17,000 acres, whereas Brighton itself only covers 14,000: the larger area is mainly farm land surrounding the town bought to ensure adequate water supplies. De. velopment of this land must per. haps await the day when the new council offices are finally built, to house a local authority which administers an area far larger than the present Brighton,",

When the extremely strong position of the reserves is taken into account as well, there is not thought to be any real risk of the franc getting into serious difficulties. And the same calculation is in large measure believed to account for the Banque de France's apparent ;As liss l. *k l: l In thetilftrstplce,' it is pointed out thatiU.S. companies and inter* national financial institutions have been buying dollars with francs recently to meet liquidity shortages in the U.S. and to take advantage of the higher interest rates avail. able over there. Tourist deficit It is also being said in trading circles that the French tourist deficit-always a factor behind the franc's weaker tendency at this time of year-may be biting rather more sharply. There has been talk of heavy overseas military equip- ment purchases as well, though, as usual In France, it is impossible to get any official confirmation of this point A Iourth reason given is that the aut1horities have been buying dollars wkh francs instead of gol to cover temporary debts bfore the books are balanced for the fourth quarter's trading which, as usual, is expected to show S hand* some surlus. The Intereting point about this explanation s that it implies that the Banque de France preferred to se the franc weaken in the open market rather than lose some of the mammoth. old hoardings General de Gaulle' Government has so carefully built up as a major pillar of Its foreiln policy, Missing factor But when all thee reasons have been listed there still seems to be a feeling that they do not fully account for the rather dramatic downward swing, The mising factor, in some bankers' view Is simply a growing appreheniion about Franc's iolated potlo n the Internetonal monetary ield. which has ben vilorously .bbed In by the evevtt o racnt weeks and, In Partlcular during the pro, Jude to the IMP meeting In Wash Soi Is recognlsed as being a. completely unemeasurtible con- idetion whinh runs In the face f the ontry'i enormous reserves nd heaiihy balinco of paymentl, Neverthels, as one trader said to me s\" We mey not spreulr agalnel the ra It we rtlny won't suppor t i A tlim whn I Prn .rn9m the .'.~,the world if any. ithin realy di eo* wrong dltltoral Commlnt Prp 14",

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORDON TETHER THE RECENT failure of the Fire Auto and Marine Insurance Com- pany coming in the wake of a long serie of estate agent and hire pur- chase failures involving thousands of people in serious losse clearly shows that the U.K. is not doing nearly enough to provide the public with a reasonable degree of protectioa against commercial mal- practice. There are many ways in which this wekness could be remedied. But none, it seems to me has more to commend it than making it com. p0lsory for all institutions operat- g in fields in which these disasters are liable to occur to obtain insur- ance with an officially-backed organisation in respict of outstand- ing commitments to the public. For besides giving the manin-the-street the security he ought to have, this would operate as a powerful deter- rent to the kind of abuse of his trust we have been seeing so much of in recent years. A Greater Need In commenting recently on the way in which the previous mknage- ment of the Sempah Holdings Com- pany had arranged for a sizeable part of its assets to \"disappear,\" its new chairman, Mr. J. E. V. Rice, called for swift action to pro- vide the investing public with greater safeguards against fraud. He was, of course, fully justified in doing so. For it has been calcu- lated that the sum shareholders have lost in this affair exceeds that involved in the \"Great Train Robbery.\" And in this case the victims are seemingly not even going to have the satisfaction of seeing someone brought to book. But if there is a case for afford- ing the shareholder greater protec- tion, there is an even greater one for reducing the vulnerability of the ordinary member of the public to loss in respect of commercial and financial activities wherein he is not supposed to be running any risk to speak of-a vulnerability that is clearly tending to become more and more marked. The average shareholder is, after all, a sinan- cially sophisticated being and is also aware-or at least should be -that only by exercising due care in placing his money can he guard against unpleasant surprises. But those buying motor insur- ance or placing deposits with estate agents in respect of an intended house purchase are drawn from all sections of the community. And, whether they are financially sophisticated or not, they would rarely imagine that they had any cause to worry about their money being treated rightly. The same applies in only a slightly smaller degree to those putting money on deposit with building noieties and instalment credit fiqance houses. It would not be true to say that nothing hat been done in these fields about reducing scope for abuse of the public's tust. The new legislation governing adver Using for deposits by finance houses and similar institutions placed on the Statute Book a few ears ago has had helpful effects n reducing the vulnerability of the public to activities of incompetent or criminal businessmen operating in this line of business. Other oflicial measures, coupled with the publicity given to the failures of a few years ago, have made it less likely that money will be unduly eposed by being loaned to fringe building societies. And the Estate Agents' Association has been devoting a good deal of attention to the question of how supervision could be strengthened in its sector to prevent the in, efficient or unscrupulous concern damaging the good name those specialising in this work have enjoyed in the past. But it is questionable whether the measures already taken in these three fields with those now contemplated would provide the public with the degree of protec- tion against loss it is entitled to expect. And in the motor insur- ance field the door is still wide open to ruthless exploitation of its trust. There is an urgent need, therefore, for action if further scandals are to be avoided. The Treatment Treatment could, of course, take many forms. An obvious one is the introduction of licensing arrangements for all institutions that take substantial sums of money from the public on trust, whether they do so by way of loans for financing their business or-as. in the case of insurance-in respect of services they have committed themselves to perform in the future. And this procedure is, indeed, already widely followed abroad. An alternative method is to re- quire concerns taking money on trust to invest a stipulated mini- mum proportion of it In such a way that their ability to discharge their commitments to the public is largely guaranteed. This is the procedure that has been introduced in respect of insurance activity in South Africa since a number of failures a few years back drew attention to the need for much closer supervision of instititons operating in this field. But. as I said at the start, the approach that strikes me as having the greatest appeal is one that has been adopted fairly extensively abroad to prevent the public's money being put at undue risk in respect of its banking activities- the one that makes it obligatory for deposit.takers to guarantee their commitments to the public against default by insuring them with a central organisation. It seems to me that, with suitable variation to meet the special requirements of the individual spheres of activity, such a scheme could serve to pro- vide the public with adequate pro- tection in all the fields in which its trust is now apt to be abused. This line of attack would have many advantages over the others I have mentioned. It would, for one thipg, entail less interference with the ordinary business activi- ties of the companies it affected than that of imposing restrictions on the way in which their funds are employed. It would have the advantage over the licensing system of beiLg less inhibiting to the emer- gence of new concerns, since any suitable would-be entrant prepared to pay the appropriate insurance premium would be able to open for business. Moreover, it would not only provide the public with greater pro. tection than licensing-which, after all, can only try to see that unsuit- able companies are not allowed to function. It would also spare the authorities the embarrassment they are inevitably apt to be caused when a licensed concern does run into diffiqulties and they find them- selves being accused of having let the public down by pinning a badge on a company that should never have had one. At Little Cost Yet while it could give greater protection to the public than any other form of control, the. intro- duction of mandatory insurance in respect of business concerns' commitments to the public could be equally effective in preventing scandals of the kind that have been cropping up all too fre- quently in recent years. For, to be able to qualify for insurance at all, a business concern would have to show that it would con- duct itself with full regard to the need to ensure that the public's money was not put at undue risk. And because the scheme should in this way keep out the incompetent and criminally-inclined, it could be operated at very little expense -so little that the public could be provided with protection with- out any significant addition to the costs of production of the trades and industries concerned."

   "text_content" : "THE ASSOCIATION of Super- visory Staffs. Executives and Technicians, an outspoken oppo- nent of the wage freeze, has promoted a number of court actions for breach of contract against firms that rescinded agreements to increase wages in response to the Prime Minister's appeal. Yesterday it won the first of them, and so put the Government in a difficulty. It is at least possible that a number of employers will now decide that they cannot hold the line and that a number of other unions will now follow ASSET's example. If many do so, the wage freeze will be in serious danger of melting away. How- ever reluctantly, therefore, the Government may be forced to bring into play Part IV of its Prices and Incomaes Act-it needs only to lay an Order and have it confirmed when Parlia. ment reassembles-which gives it power to make the freeze bind- ing on.employers.. A compromise? Yet it is unlikely to resort to compulsion until it has to. Even if it proves inescapable, a com- promise is possible-to bring in the whole of Part IV but to acti- vate only part of it More speci- fically, it would be possible to make use of Clause 30, which provides employers with statu- tory protection against actions for breach of contract if they observe the freeze, without making use of the controversial Clause 29, which provides powers for compelling com- panies to restrict wages to the level of July 20. The principle of voluntary co-operation with the Government would thus be preserved. But even this compromise throws up difficulties. In the first place, the courts may inter. pret Clause 30 to mean that em- ployers should enjoy protection against breach of contract actions only in the case of agree- ments coming into force after Part IV of the Act is imple- mented. In that case, it might not be enough in itself to pre- vent the freezp from melting so badly as to lose its shape. In the second place, the many unions and Labour M.P.s who have been unsettled by recent hints about what is to follow the freeze would bitterly regret even a first step in the direction of compulsion. The fact that the company involved in yesterday's action has obtained a stay of execution and is considering an appeal gives the Government time to wait and see. If an appeal is made, the court may-- in view of its importance to other cases-decide to hear it fairly quickly. But at least it may not be necessary to take action until the party conference is safely out of the way. Real problem This may be a relief to Ministers, but it hardly affects theii real problem. The period of rigid wage freeze was intro- duced, rightly or wrongly, to help restore overseas confidence in sterling and to prepare the way for an effective incomes policy next year. Having been introduced, it must be observed: the Government must shut its eyes to absurdities, prevent ex- ceptions from multiplying, and use all the means at its disposal to. prevent the freeze from melting. But it is almost cer- tainly easier to enforce a rigid freeze for a short period than to enforce a modified freeze in which certain exceptions (most people can claim to be either highly productive or under- paid) are officially recognised. As to the permanent incomes policy that is to succeed the freeze, nobody yet seems to have any clearer idea of what is involved than they did when the phrase was first introduced. Meanwhile, those who deplore Government interference in the processes of free bargaining and those who argue that this is a major advance in the direction of socialism are both working hard to re-open the split that separates the right from the left of the Labour Party. Whether or not he puts off bringing Part IV into action, the Prime Minister seems likely to have a lively party conference."

Most of the trends which were already apparent in August-de-sto6king by retailers, merchants and manufacturers, holding back of capital expenditure-have become more wideo spread. Only a part of this can be ascribed directly to the worsening situation in the motor industry, but the cutbacks in the Midlands are having serious reper- cussions. Signs of weakness are beginning to appear even in those parts of the engineering industry which until recently were overloaded with orders and desperately short of skilled labour. A number of contracts are still being placed in connection with projects which were authorised several months ago.

To sum up, the shortage of credit and the general atmosphere of une'tainty are making businessmen and consumers shrink fromt long-term commitments.

It now appears that ingot output for the year may be not much more than 24m. tons, compared with last year's 27m. tons; at the start of 1966 most official forecasts were around the 25m. ton mark. Imports are rising at a disturb- ing rate, and there is a danger of further competition from overseas when the surcharge comes off-just at the time when the Government's defla- tionary measures will be taking full effect. Chemicals The underlying rate of growth is so high that many of the in- dustry's capital investment pro- jects will go ahead in spite'of the squeeze. The timing of some projects will be altered; the completion date of ICI's nylon polymer plant in Scotland has been deferred for a year, but this may be exceptional. A com- pany planning a more basic plant, such as a new ethylene cracker, will probably stick to its original schedule. Spending by the chemical industry in 1967, though down on 1965 and 1966; will still be substantial. Where projects are \"stretched out,\" it will mean that the plants can be built in a more orderly way and perhaps at lower cost. Engineering The intake of new orders appears to, be slowing down. In August, the Economic Development Committee for mechanical engineering reported that \"orders and deliveries are now approximately in balance but still exhibiting a rising Letters appear on Page 8 tendency.\" A manufacturer of bearings now admits a slacken- ing in demand from general enopieering and capital goods prtducers as well as from the motor industry, Even before July 20 his customers were sharply reducing their stocks- in one case from six weeks' supply to less than one week, There is a big backlog of orders which should enable him to maintain production for several months-a good deal of over- time is being worked in certain sections-but the outlook further ahead is poor. Machine Tools Some manufacturers are anxiously wondering whether they will experience a collapse in orders of the sort which has occurred in past recessions. One big firm reports that orders booked in August and Septem- ber were about in line with output, but they included several \"windfall\" contracts- \"it's a skin-of-the-teeth order book,\" says the sales director. On some machines there is a backlog which will last for seven or eight months, but this firm is certainly not in the mood to take on additional labour. Another Birmingham firm which has been making extensive use of sub-contractors to fulfil its orders is now concentrating these jobs in its own facilities in order to keep the works fully employed. There is some evidence that productive machine tools of modern design are continuing to sell well. Labour There is a general easing in the labour market; and this is making life more comfortable for employers. It is not so much that they can now hire new em- ployees more easily-not many of them want to do so-but rather the desperate competition for workers is slackening. One employer reckons that about 80 per cent. of his labour force is fairly steady, while the remain' ing 20 per cent. moves in and out according to what is being offered elsewhere: the effect of the present situation is to make this 20 per cent. much more stable. Labour turnover, especially in firms which have long order books, has fallen sharply. There is even begin* i ning to be some competition among draughtsmen and other i skilled workers for jobs with companies which look like riding Sout the squeeze. Construction Unskilled labour is easier in the construction industry and i this is bringing some relief to , margins which have been badly I squeezed in the past. Except for the speculative house* builders, the industry remains busy, especially the large firms. Public sector orders are coming through better, and the short* term outlook is encouraging. But there is much disquiet about the longer-term outlook. Orders of every kind from the private sector are falling, and there is little to inspire confidence after next summer. This is strongly confirmed by the fall now occurring in comr missions for architects. Some weakness has now been detected even in the superficially en- couraging figures up to the half year mark; the third quarter fiures are expected to show a downturn of possibly 35 per cent. for commercial work, and the position at the moment is worse than thse figures would suggest. Some architects are seriously alarmed, and have been warning the RIBA that there will be professional redundancies on a noticeable scale (there have been a few already) by Christmas. Housing The situation in housing seems worse than recent figures would suggest. Houses completed are not necessarily houses sold-the number unsold is probably well up from the 24,000 of early August. The quite high offtcial \"igures for new starts are rgarded as meaningless-de- velopers have a strong incentive to make some sort of a start on any work for which they have planning permission as soon as possible, because this puts them beyond the grasp of the Land Commission. The later stages of construction may become very slow, At the moment the mortgage situation obscures the future: but there is a growing fear that there may be little effective demand pent up behind the dam. There are simply not enough people who want to move into the areas which many potential buyers want to leave-at least until there is a substantial break in second-hand house prices. Even new buyers, unencumbered by old houses, are holding back. Wimpey, the biggest builder of them all, illustrates the situation only too clearly. Wimpey sells two-thirds of its houses to new buyers, and is able to offer full mortgage facilities even now. It is currently selling 120 houses a week, against a normal 180, and rightly considers th-: a very good performance in present circum- stances. The industry's forecasts are being scaled down. Completions this year now seem unlikely to pass 200,000, leaving the grand total much the same as last year. Next year the private sector might well drop back to 160.000 --the lowest output in the '60s. Cars In cars, unlike houses, the situation at the moment is not so bad as the BMC-dominated news would suggest. August sales were 131 per cent. below the 1965 level, and this month is unlikely to be better and could be worse. But with three Important new model ranges in e wings better *For \",the longer uiture, es4t: mates vary within the industry. Those who expect a relatively good start to 1967 look for a inal outturn much the same as this year; the more pessimistic (notably BMC itself) see sales about 15 per cent. down for the full year from last July. But everyone agrees that the end of 1967 should be relatively bright, so the gap between the two views is only about 10 per cent. over the whole of 1967. The most encouraging factor at the moment is the resilience of the second-hand market, which was thought especially vulnerable. Latest estimates put the current level les, than 20 per cent. below 1965-bad but not diastrous. Cash customers pro. vide the strength: hire-purchase business is about 25 per cent. down. Small cars up to Â£400 are the sellers. Motor industry output, on these trends, should be some 90 per cent. of last year's level once the present crisis of stock-Clear- ing (mainly BMC again) is past ' -assuming a stable export per- formance. Durables The near-saturated markets for white durables and television sets remain heavily depressed. But consumers are still willing to spend substantial sums on other things. Furniture is holding up better than expected (it has been exempted from HP squeezes in some years, but was not in July); and bedding is actually enjoying a minor boom, thanks partly to tr a big promotional push by one manufacturer. Carpets continue to sell better and better. Retailing . Most general retailers are quite happy about the present, though very doubtful about the future. Their current worries are not so much the threatened cut in consumption as more imme- diate matters-the warm Sep- y tember weather, which has hit the clothing trade, the shortage of bank credit, and the impact .of SET.. .. - The pattern ofde-stocklag is confused. Big efficietit chains which have built themselves up on fast stock-turn are not cutting down except where sales are actually falling, but some smaller firms are running what they re- gard as dangerously low stocks. Big units on either side of the fence are being asked to carry the load for small ones-big manufacturers by way of credit and quicker deliveries to small shops, big retail units through extra weekly settlements (at a dis. count) for small suppliers. Co-operation in adversity is threatened by the wrangle over SET. Retailers, especially tbose with major buying power, are already tryipn to get man sac turers to cut their prices at east far enough to absorb their SBT rebates,",

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staff The Trauport ma General Workes' UAi e mspainp flor, work4darln rather than redundaml.la I the .motor *adutry .eceived its frnt major setback yesterday. A meetin of over 5,000 Brtiih Motor Corporation workers at Cowley, Oiford, rpjected a motion supporting the principle of work sharing instead of layoffs. After the vote Mr. Tom Brad- ley, chairman of the joint shop stewards committee and himself a TOWU member, told them: \" You have demonstrated to us that you have no guts.\" Later Mr. Bradley told Tea FINANCAL TIMBS that it would be absolutely hypocritical to suggest that it had not been a fair vote. However, no meeting is entitled to contradict union policy.\" Efforts would now be made at individual section level to persuade workers to adoept work sharin, be odded; \"We in Oxford ha'V lived 'in an age of absolute prosperity. When it comes to fighting for principles only a minority are interested. This is natural self- preservation,\" said Mr. Bradley. Vauxhall. Protest At the Luton factory of Vauxhall Motors, shop stewards said last night they were planning a token walk-put from the factory this afternoon to protest against short- time working. But union officials advised them against this. Mr. Arthur Leary, area organiser, of the National Union of Vehicle Builders, said: \"We have put our case very strongly to the company. We have asked for the men who are due to be put on a four-day week to continue to be paid for the full 40-hour week. \"The company refused to do so and I do not believe a mass walk- out from the factory to-morrow afternoon: will cause them to change their minds.\" About 5,000 employees are due to begin work- in ia four-day week from Mon- day. Drivers' Strike There was no change yesterday in the numiibers laid off or on short time due to the strike of 600 car delivry drivers that has closed the Austin assembly lines at Long- bridge. Birpingham, since Tuesday and caused more than 15,000,BMC workers there and at subsidiary faitiies to be laid off. In addititn. 12,000 Lucas workers-have been put on short time due to the strike.

Attention is now being fastened on to-day's first official contact between BMC management and union officials since the Corpora- tion announced redundancies. This will be a local conference called at the request of the Birming- ham District Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Umons to press for work-sharing. \"What full-time officials would, I think, be prepared to accept is skilled surgery to adjust the labour force to the reduced demand for cars,\" said one official. No one is expecting BMC to give way, so the dlqpute will.almost cer- tainly go to entral conference next month, the last stage of the nego- tiating procedure. Meanwhile, more BMC sackings were announced, this time at the Morris Motors cylinder block sac- tory at Wellingborough, Northants. Ninety-nine men will receive their official notices in a week's time. Midlands Probe Thousands of Midlands. manu- facturers employing more than 20 people are being circularised by the Ministry of Labour Regional Headquarters in' Birmingham ask- ing what .vacancies they have in order to facilitate *the redeploy- ment of redundant car workers. SHundreds of .Midland car workers are planning to \"rock the boat\" at the Labour Party Conference at Brighton next week. They have already char- tered a special 10-coach train seat- ing 590 and another 400 will go by coach. On arrival at Brighton they will march to the conference hall to \" lobby \" delegates with demands for a change in the Government's \"squeeze\" policy. Rootes Lay-offs At Linwood, Paisley, union officials and shop stewards at a works conference at the Rootes Pressings car body factory yester- day failed in.their efforts to have work-sharing introduced to prevent 500 men beingi sacked as redun- dant next Friday.

   "text_content" : "FhndacI Tim. Rporqe WHEN IT.COMES to a damag- ing and distorted public image there can be no industry to rival it: casino gaming would give any PR man nightmares. The newspapers have been fall of stories of protection rackets in South London, of sttong arm men collecting debts,and of the Cosa Nostra-the Mafia's U.S. o~shoot-buying its way into British gaming. -Add to ths the tales of vast wealth accumulated by a hadd- ful of lucky casino owners, and it becomes a soiry picture. Nobody; of course, would claim that none of these things occurs in Britain, or that gaming is as innocuous as Bingo; and there are well documented case of Roulette being run with an ex- cessive quota of house numbers. But, as usual where there is a whiff of crime, the whole thing gets out of hand as people com- pete to produce the most out- rageous story, . Reform Needed It is against this background that Mr. Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, has decided to reform the gaming laws. Reform is cer- tainly needed. In the six years that have elapsed since Lord Butler first made gaming legal in this country, the original Act has become a mockery. Intended merely to allow gaming for fund raising at garden fetes, the Act was never supposed to permit the development of a commer- cial gaming industry. However, a succession of court decisions rapidly undermined the whole spirit of the 1960 Act, and quite a few reputable companies, as well as the famous gaming barons, moved in to take ad- vantage of this loophole. Because the original Betting. Gaming and Lotteries Bill was framed by men who failed to see the development of com- mercial gaming it made no pro- visions to control it. Thus there are no legal requirements on the way that the games should be played, and no overall con- trol over them, as there is on the Continent. Mr. Jenkins hopes to rectify this situation early in the New Year with a Bill which will provide for regi- stration and licensing of casinos, and give the police powers to search their premises. This is entirely laudable, and supported by most of the reputable casino \"owners, anxious over the ex- ploits of the wilder frinse. It is only a wonder that u has taken so long for such obvi- ously necessary measures to be taken. But as Mr. lain Macleod recently wrote, the trouble with gaming legislation and many of the falts' of the previous Act arise from the fact that few Members of Parliament have much expertise in this field. The Home secretary further hopes to break the connection between gambling and crime by preventing the casino from taking any part in the actual play. Casinos typically draw their profits from the fact that Mr. Roy Jenkins in roulette the zero is reserved for the bank. The bank thus has a built-in advantage over the long run of play, amounting to just under 3 per cent. of stakes. In theory,. anyone is free to hold the bank, and in most casinos it is ritually offered at regular intervals. In prac- tice, though, few people are willing to risk the heavy losses which could be involved, and typically the bank is only taken about once in six months. It is this margin, and similar ad- vantages in blackjack and craps, which have made casino gaming profitable and this is what the new Bill will outlaw. In so doing, it may well spell the end of all organised gaming in this country, The draft pro- posals involve fixed maximum charges for each period of play -probably four hours-payable at the door, rather in the man- ner of Bingo. Unfortunately the parallel is not a useful one. Bingo is a low cost, mass market operation, in which the several thousand half-crowns collected each week can easily pay the cost of the handful of officials, I and the rent of an old cinema. Gaming is very different Most clubs from the Playboy to Crockford's. provide lavish faci- I lities and the two croupiers at I each table have to be paid as I much as Â£100 a week. The entry 1 fee for. a smart casino 'woul 4 have to be of the order of Â£25 - to cover the overheads, which I are about Â£20,000 a month at Crockford's. This is a sizeable 4 deterrent, and would certainly I deter many of the casual gamblers. To-morrow, Mr. Callaghan's new gaming tax comes into force. This will levy Â£5,000 a cost of the handful of ofaiiats, ( year on the smallerrent of ld cinema. nd Â£50,000 on those that have a rateable value of over Â£3,0.

Apart 'ftc~m Â· the fact thai the Home Office would be destroying the gamian levy so soon aftet its inception, the disappearance of legal gaming would inevitably encourage underground opera- tions. This would be far more susceptible to criminal control than well-disciplined commer- cial casinos. The British Gaming Assocla. tion, headed by Mr. Erie Morley, of Mecca, is to put its case to Mr. Jenkins in the near future. It is to be hoped that he will listen, for it seems clear that the Home Office is woo. fully short on statistics and hard information about casino opera. tion. in this country. The Churches' Council on Gambling puts gaming turnover for 1965 at Â£85m. and the Customs and Excise hopes to recover Â£17m. from gaming and betting to- ether. But both estimates could be wildly wrong. The BOA- would like Mr. Jenkins to allow casinos to charge different amounts to different people depending on how long they play, and on how much they stake. This may be impractical but it would rescue the casinos from the awkward predicament of having to levy a large charge on a man who only wants to Mr. Eric Morley wager for a few pounds. Some of the more outspoken casino owners are convinced that Mr. Jenkins is using the fuss created by criminals to put through measures which stem from the traditional Socialist moral dis- like of gambling itself. Whether this is so the flexibility of the response of Mr. Jenkins to the BGA's proposals will show.",

The Jobbers' Committee has now handed Spicer and Pegler's report to the Council. The jobbing problems-mainly inadequate profitability and imper. manence of capital-have been highlighted again recently by the lowest level of Stock Exchange business since 1957-58 and the closing down of two more jobbing firms.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF There is another shock for the market to-day in Uaited Gla passing the interim divi- dend (see Lex Page 1) but, on the brighter side, Crompton Parklson's results look better than seemed likely at the in- terim stage and Geo. Wispey's performance has the edge on others` recently reporting from the bulding sector (see Lex). In the Bids and Deals field, Lister is to make an offer for Bellman, and British Steel Constrmetions for Taydde Floorcovernins. Desoutter Bros. The half-time results of Desotter Brother are good. Turnover is a fifth up and, more important, margins have held with profits before tau nearly 23 per cent higher at Â£639,000. Rising costs. were the problem last year, but the group has clearly got to work on this particular factor. Expansion and increased produc- tion has probably been the key, and fortunately Desoutter. unlike some other companies, has' not been caught with a lot of extra and expensive plant and no business. Demand has stayed strong for two reasons. First. the main subsidiary sells two-thirds of its output over- seas and exports look like growing further now that the group has managed to break into the U.S. air- craft industry. The second point is that the range of pneumatic and electrical power tools is consistently being strengthened with new lines, which are expected to meet with plenty of success. And the group is not going to be held up by lack .of funds-the last accounts still showed over a lÂ£m. in net liquidity. All this leaves the 5.6 per cent. yield at 35s 3d well supported, and if the same level of profits can be held in the second six months, cover for the 40 per cent. rate would be almost 1.8 times and the P/E ratio 9.9. Morgan Crucible Although not exciting, the half- year statement from Morga Crueble is reassuring. Sales for the first six months are up 6.6 per cent. to Â£12.01m.; margins have been held and pre-tax profits emerge 7.3 per cent. better than the corresponding period of the previous year. But the comfort lies in the tail of the announcement with expectations of total profits comparable to those of 1965. For Morgan has subsidiaries supplying the radio and TV industries and is also a manufacturer of refrac- tories for the steel industry, which are not helped by a deflating economy. Fortunately, the group is very active in overseas markets-total overseas sales and exports accounted for around 40 per cent. f .the Â£22.19m. turnover last year '-and this can provide a useful buffer against any downturn in home demand. At 39s. up 2s 3d yesterday, the shares yield 7.8 per cent. on a 15 per cent. dividend- the interim is maintained at 6 per cent. F. J. Reeves Since F. J. Reeves operates primarily as timber importers, it would have been no surprise if the half-year statement had been one of unrelieved gloom. In fact, pre. tax profits are over 18 per cent. better at Â£251.000; and although this includes a useful contribution from the Philip and Son acquisi. tion, it is plain that the \" original \" group bas started 1966 extremely well. Apart from its timber side, how- ever, Reeves has been diversifyinB its activities in recent years and, even more important, the building downturn has been less severe In the West Country. Sales so far in the second half-year are satis- factory, although the remainigp months \"will be difficult.\" But even on the basis of unchanged total profits, a repeated 12 per cent. dividend would be covered some 1.3 times. Meanwhile, the shares at 7s 4%d yield 8.3 per cent. and sell at 9.4 times earnings. George M. Whiley As manufacturers of gold leaf and metallic stamping foil, George M. Whiley has made an excellent start to 1966. Profits for the first half are 30 per cent. higher at Â£165,000 pre-tax and the statement is a politician's dream: \"increased output .. . reduced labour force .. improved production methods.\" The non-metallic division-Nulcaf, which was acquired last year- shows unchanged profits of Â£49,000, but extensions are in hand which should increase production in 1967. Group customers include foot- wear, publishing, leatber and plas- tic goods where foils are concerned; gold leaf, for exterior and internal decoration, can sometimes have a wide area to cover-take the reno- vation of St. Paul's, for example. Whiley's third side, metallised papers and films, brings in elec- tronics. Short-term, it looks as if second-half profits could be as good as the first, indicating earnings of over 51 per cent. and a higher divi- dend rate, Government permitting. At 18s, up 6d yesterday, Whiley looks good value with a yield of 5.6 per cent. on the present, 20 per cent., dividend and a prospective p/e ratio of just over 7 times. First National In the first six months of 1965 Prst National Fhauce Corpora- lion made Â£361,000 pre-tax, in the second six months Â£444,000, so although profits are Â£462,000 in the first half of 1966, the trend does show a definite slowing down. But this is not surprising. With roughly half its buiness in banking activities and the other in H.P the credit squeeze is biting, an the second half of 1966 will feel the full effect of the latest restric- tions and a 7 per cent. Bank Rate. H.P. is falling off sharply and bridging finance is suffering from the fall in house sales. Thus First National will do well to make Â£900,000 pre-tax for the full year compared with Â£806,000, but on this basis earnings would emerge at around 20 per cent. for a main- tained 13- per cent, dividend-the interim is held at 5 per cent. Thus at 9s 3d the shares yield 7.1 per cent. with a prospective P/E ratio of 9.1-both better than the H.P. average. Barber Textile Wednesdav's note on Barer Tetile did less than justice to the group in omparing the 196546 profit of Â£93,000 with the 127,000 earned In 1963-64. The latter figure Included Â£41,000 relating to a subsidiary subsequently sold following which there was a capital repayment of is 6d a share. The true comparison is thus with Â£86,000. William Collins Considering the competitiv- nature or the publishing businens William Collli and Somn has had al ood first half. Certainly demand does not appear to have eased, for the 12Y per cent. Increase to Â£3,94m. in a0le malntains the pace of 1955, Pre-tax proflts are up by 6X per cent, to Â£325.000- roflecting some pressure on margins, but nothing, serious, Although cost have Increased con- siderably and SET is going to tie up 530,000 of capital initially,. prospects for the second half seem to discount adverse Iatorn. The point is that the August. December period is the main season for book. and diarles (very Important a1ound Chrlstmas) and August and Septemer have been good for sales. About two.fifths of turnover goes for export, besides important oversea subsidiaries. The Australian and New Zealand companies both did better in 1965.66 (their year-ends do not tally with the parent) and the group is expanding In the paper back field through Fontana and Pan. In fact. it seems that marjlns are Improvina somewhat and the should be a reasonable chance of Â£l.16m, pre-tax profts agalnst Â£1,09m. last year. With the fore. cast 10 per Cent, dividend covered about 2,4 times on this estimate, ater a straight 40 per cent, tax churge, the shares lery deerve their 3.4 per cent. yield at 9s. A forpectve PIr ratio of 12.2: tok4 fair.",

   "text_content" : "Due to various factors the directors of Scottish Television envisage difficulty in Iealising the Â£1.2m. profit estimate contained in last ucToDers prospectus. Pre-tax profits for the first half of 1966 amount to Â£500,384. Revenue from all sources in the period was Â£2,614,081 from which Exchequer levy of Â£451,573 was paid. Advertisement income in the period was below espectations, but the com. pany's share of total television adver. tising expenditure was maintained. stat the directors. They say the first two months of the second half of the year have shown an \"encouraging resumption.\" of the upward trend in advertising revenue, but the Government's della. tionery measures, the imposition of the jobs tax and an increase in the local rates, will make it difficult to realise the prospectus profit estimate.

Some improvieint.s expected In tbe seond half-year, but tax will affect the company more heavily this'year and a reduction in the distribution of profits for the year as a whole must also be expected, says the chairman Sir James Helmore. JaCCpU, Â»uyl Jwe cnarmIan iU J, SHolders received a total of 15 per cent for 1965--interim 5 per cent and second interim 10 per cent. -Worse than expected .Last May Sir James mentioned some factors which were causing anxiety, but, he says, the half-year results are worse than then expected, and he outlines the reasons. Glass container profits deteriorated due main,to- unsatisfactory results o Key Ilassworks, 'arising from erious ,operating and technical failures at ts New Cros fact6jo and an excessive increase In opertling costs at its Harlow factory, and to the ,, continued failure ps sales volumes (despite an increase on the previods year) to reach their exrected level, resultingi ita surplus br producton capacity. The plastic container operation has not mantained its previously mprov ing .trend and incurred significant lodes due to poor selling prices and rising costs. The move to new mould manufacturing shops at Pudsey and Alloa involved additional overhead and operating costs at larger premises which, owing to shortages of skilled labour, are not yet fully employed. . The chairman outlines various stdps \" which have been or are being taken to rectify, the situation. Operations and management of glass container subsidiaries in England (United Glass (England) and Key Glassworks) are being integrated to provide more economic operating. Operations and management of glass container subsidiaries in Scot. raid are also being integrated. Expenditure is being drastically pruned. Due to standing charges and other causes outside the control of thb local management and work- people, the Charlton factory remains a high cost producer, and its continu- ation cannot be justified in the cur.. rent economic conditions. SMeasures are being taken to i-. prove the performance of the New ',, Cross factory. Utmost pressure is being exercised to apply Owens- Illinois technology and methods. WAaCticu, -Wya we cnuarman air j --------~ 1 The .measures, together with the comin into operation of the new gl contaner manufacturi , uit at Patey .(first production shop-- October thb year; second shop-June, 1967). will Improve .the position The setback in trading results has adversely affected cash resources and the introduction of the jobs tax will place a further strain on resources, esecally in the next few months when th total amount paid, before any premiums are receved will rse to An adequate flow of funds for new capital projects must be .rovided notably for the coatinuation of the Peasley project, in order tb improve eficiency, and, the chairman adds there is no certainty when investment grants will be received. The Board has given very careful consideration to the question of the payment of an interim dividend which, t at 5 per cent. would require Â£308,000 (inclusive of income tax) a substantial proportion of which would have to come from reserves. In the light of the factors the present national economic conditions and the uncertain outlook, the Board has decided that prority must be given to conserving cash resources.

Group pretax profits for the half- year to July 31, 1966. were Â£52.000 compared with Â£64,000 for previous year. The reduction of profit is primarily due to higher costs on the retail side which have not been covered by increased turnover. The present conditions of restraint on personal expenditure make any fore- cast of future profits extremely dif- cult, the directors state.",

   "text_content" : "In the genral branch, boluneu of the Prudentdal Awurance Company continues to expaned ad pemitUmn ncome for the l hbalf of 1966 a-sounted to nearly t16m. -a Increasie of almogt 10 per cent. on last year's corresponding Igue. The provisional underwriting surplus from fire and accident business for the first half is estimated at Â£600,000 before tax, but it is pointed out that direct conclusions as to profits for the.full year cannot be drawn from the first half figures. In 1965 the underwriting surplus in the first half was Â£500,000-that year finished with'an eventual sur- plus of Â£190,000. There has been a slight falling of in profits from U.K. business but a profit in Canada where results have been adverse for some years past, state the directors. The gross Investment income attri- butable to the profit and loss account in the general branch amounts to some Â£920,000 for the irst half of 1%66-after excluding dividends re ceived prior to April 6 which would normally have been receive .after June 30-which corresponds with the amount of Â£815,000 for the first half of 1965. Unchanged interim dividends have been declared on the \"A\" and \"B\" shares of 3jd and 2.4d respectively, both net of income tax. Last years total on the \"A\" was 10.3d tax free, and that on the \"B\" 5.5d tax free per Is share. On July 15, the company reported new premium income under assur- ances and annuitles effected in the life branches, during'the 1966 first half of Â£17.11n., compared with Â£15.6m. in the same period of 1965. WM. COLLINS SALES RISE Wiam Coulli..-a SBon (Hold. aIn), publishers, announces that sales have increased from Â£3,501,000 to Â£3,939,000, a rise of 121 per cent., for the half-year to June 30, 1966. Thk increase has been fully maintained to date and those to export markets (up 13 per cent.) account for a substantial part of increase. The estimated pretax trading profit is Â£325,000 (Â£305,000), but it is pointed out that profits for the second half are normally considerably in excess of those for the first half. Overseas branches continue to expand and the Australian and New Zealand companies have both shown increased profits for the year ended June 30, 1966. However, costs have increased considerably this year and the effect of Government measures is not yet clear, but they expect to bCneft slightly ftom 'SET, although 0,000 capital will be tied up. I 5, I. I' t. L is Ii Ce n 1. DESOUTTER PROFITS ADVANCE The chairman of Desoatter Brother (Holdhiag), Mr. R. C. Desoutter, in his statement for the half year to June 30, 1966, says that group turnover haa increased by 20 er cent. and the order book level has been maintained. Group profit before tax was up from Â£521,000 to Â£639,000. ' \" Mr. Deoutter goes on to say that the. mai: subsidiary sells two-thirds of its output overseas, and the current export psition is \"very satisfactory.\" There are good pospects ofincreased sates in the Unlted States, following the recent breakthrough into the American aircraft ndustry. On the home market, it is impossible to assess the extent to *hich trade will be affected by the recent steps taken by the Government. The company makes pneumatic and electrical power tools. An unchanged interim dividend has already been declared. The 1965 total was 40 per cent. WOLF ELECTRIC TOOLS The chairman of Wolf . Electrie Tools (Holdigs), Mr. 0. M. Wolfe, expects that the Government's eco- nomic measures are bound to have some impact on profitability during the second half of the current year and make it very difficult for him to forecast the full 1966 results with accuracy. Group sales during the first half of 1966 were about the same as for the corresponding period last year. Since prices have in general been held despito the inevitable rise in certain cost, some decline in group earnings for the period must be anticipated. The recent devaluation of the Indian Rupee will result in a decrease of one-third in terms of sterling of any dividend receipts from Indian associates. World-wide activities have also been extended by the formation of two new Wolf companies designed to develop export potential These will be concerned with marketing products in USA and South Africa. Mr. Wolfe adds that the company is continuing steadily to increase its activities to edsure that full advantage can be taken of any eventual improve- ment in the economic climate. ATKINSON LORRIES At the annual meeting of Atldmaon Lorries (Holdings) in London yester- day the chairman, Mr. W. G. Allen said that as a generalisation it would appear that profit at the beginning of this year showed no great increase or decrease so far. \"Our order book,\" he added, is still very healthy and, as soon as our extension at Bamber Bridge gets going (in April 1967), it will be posslble to start Increasing our output.\" Statement Page 10",

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter Subject to property market conditions, it was the intention of the directors of Sussex Rubber Company to convert assets, including property, into cash and then distribute that cash to shareholders, Mr. C. I Steen, chairman, told yesterday's extraordinary general meeting in London. I _-. . As reported on September 1, the meeting had been arranged to seek shareholders' approval for the sale of trading assets and goodwill to a newly-formed subsidiary of Vita- foam. Vitafoam is the principal manufacturing and trading subsidi- ary of British Vita. When a shareholder asked the chairman if the company was to be wound up and net assets returned to shareholders, Mr. Steen admitted that there was an \"element of doubt\" in the circular to members. The shareholder suggested that net assets would be nearer Â£500.000 than Â£340,000, a figure indicated by the directors' estimate that shareholders should receive not less than 4s 6d per 2s unit. Mr. Steen replied that the Board had taken advice \"from an eminent firm\" and repeated that it was im- possible to say what propertywould fetch in two years' time. He added that there was \"no question of any golden handshakes\" beinginvolved. Resolution approving the deal sale of assets, etc., to Vitatoam, a change of name to Willesden Holdings, and altering the articles of association were passed unanimously. yvasLeuay a rCAUaLiu5ai y SUUWAIU FIRST NATIONAL FINANCE Group pre-tax profits of the FIrt Nadtonal Fiance Corporation in- creased from Â£361,374 to Â£462,246 in the half-year to June 30. 1966.

The interim dividend remains at 5 per cent. in respect' of 1966-last year's total was 13 per cent The net balance attributable to the company amounted to Â£256,065 (Â£213,929. after tax Â£193,431 (Â£135,515, and minority interests Â£12,750 (Â£11,930).

   "text_content" : "The following is the Statement by the Chairman, Ma. LAUxNcs P. Scorr, circulated with the report and accounts of The Manchester Guardian and Evening News Limited for the year to March 26, 1966:- The company'sprofit for the year to March, 1966 was a highly satisfactory one. Trading profit wat Â£746,229 compared with Â£552,622 in the previous year and the consolidated profit after taxa- tion and after deducting the minority interest in our evening paper subsidiary was Â£390,219 com. pared with Â£182,545 in the previous year. Twelve months ago I viewed the immediate future with some forebodin, I expected to see an early decline in the volume of advertising in all newspapers including our own and with it a decline m our profits. I could not have been more wrong. We have received considerably more adver- tsin than ever before and our pros have been the highest in our history. However on the evidence now before us of forward bookings. I must repeat my warning, and this year it is to some extent a fact, in that the flow of advertising in our newspapers has already during the summer of 1966 shown clear signs of slowing down. Our trad. ing results for the current year will not be as good as thou of last e. Turning from the field of adXvr- tsing to that of circulation the picture is much more encouraging. Salea of the Guardian hive een excellent in recent months and despite a noticiable improvement in the appearanee and in the con tents of our principal competitor our net saidfor the month f Jmne .ua some 9,000 copies hiher than in the previous year. Saim of th Manchester Evening News have also been above last year in every month since January. This proof that our newspapers are increas- inly attractive to readers should. help to persuade advertiiers tha in the difficult months ahead the Gu&rdian and the Manchester Evening News do offer them really good value for money. Since the end of the year the company has acquired the entire share sitl of Comet Newspapec (Mancheste) Limited. This rep r sents a venture into the field of periodical printing sad possibly publishing. Comet Newspapers should be e to accept printing contracts for roary oft work from early in 1967 and since the plant at Lowton wil be one of the most modern in the North of England and capable of high quality colour reproduction we believe we have got the nucleus of what might in the long un urove to be a valuable investment.",

   "text_content" : "A great step forward in the pos: ible, formation of a new' unifed: professional institute to represent purchasing officers in industry, oationalised industry, local govern- mnat, and cenral government, was reported at te sannusl neeting of the Purchating Offesn Association: held at Backpool on September 29th.- A. Maonrr President 19I/7 It was reported that the Institute of Public Supplies and the Pirchas. ing Officers Association had agreed that their officers should consider forming an institute and that they should report back'to the govern- in8 bodies of the two organisations. The newly elected President of the Purchasing Officers Association, Mr. A. Morrson, Director of Sup- plies of Greater London Council, commented: \"A united body would cover practically all the industrial and public purchasing and storage in the United Kingdom and would confer a professional qualification equally valid in the government service and private enterprise. All of us would be strengthened in all our dealings and the future of the profession for ourselves and our successors would be assured.\" Officers for 1966-67 were elected as follows: President, Mr. A. Morrison; Chairman of Council, Mr. A. M. Taylor, Metal Industries Ltd; vice-chairman, Mr. H. R. Venables, A. E. C. Ltd; hon. treasurer, Mr. A. S. Colston, Kodak Ltd. It was reported that the educa- tional scheme continued to expand. More than 60 colleges co-operated in providing courses in purchasing and stores control; this year had seen tie launching of the first honours degree course with specialism in supplies work and two higher degree courses were also being planned. More people than ever before were taking the Association's examinations and were interested in the seminars and courses, which were an extension of further education in purchasing and materials management. The chairman, Mr. G. E. Dix, set out the position of the Associa- tion with regard to requests for co*operation from the Govern- ment. He stated; \"The stand of the Association is definite and roper; t can be summed up a. We should co-operate with any reasonable requests of the British Government. b. It is correct to encourage our members to resist unjustifiable price increases. This is for the beneit of every member's firm. es That no commercial, confiden- tial or secret information should be disclosed.\"",

   "text_content" : "port and Accounta:- When we published our half- yearly statement in Febuary of this year wb forecast the prdit for the year ending 31st Match 1966, before tax, would be notless than Â£1,200,000. In fact the profit has turned out to be Â£1,213,699 for which great credit is due to all con- cerned. It has been attained through an increase in deliveries, in which our new factory at Sandiacre has played its part, an increase in efficiency and is due, to some extent, to our having had longer runs than usual of the same type of production. The introduction of corporation tax has affected the comparison of the charge for taxation with pre- vious years. Last year the. total charge was Â£524,000 against Â£438,200 this year, of which Â£430,000 is corporation tax and Â£8,200 profits and income tax. This leaves available for distribution and allocation Â£775,499. Dividend Recommendation To take advantage of the transi- tional tax arrangements we paid an interim dividend of 17% per cent compared with 5 per cent. for the previous year and now, recognising the dividend standstill, we propose a final dividend of 7Y per cent. making a total of 25 per cent. for this year as it was for last. Dividends, both Preference and Ordinary, with the relative in- come tax, absorb Â£299,386, leaving for further allocation Â£476,113 but it should be realised that, if exist- ing legislation remains unchanged, the cost of similar dividends next year will be Â£402,825. The amount available for allo- cation affords the Board the oppor- tunity of augmenting the fund, started last year, for providing pen- sions for Works Employees and a further Â£100,000, making Â£200,000 in all, was paid over to an assur. ance company for this purpose. This is sufficient to inaugurate a scheme which will give a fixed annual pension for each year of service. We feel sure you will agree that this and the associated life assurance scheme, which we are also starting, are most desir- able steps, particularly in view of the tradition of long service which has been of such benefit to the Company. Factory at Sandiaere The purchase of a factory at Sandiacre near Nottingham, to which reference was made last year, is now reflected in the Balance Sheet and the factory's operations for eight months from August 1965 are, of course, in. cluded in the year's results. The purchase price of the factory and plant was Â£550,000, of which Â£420,000 represented land and buildings, the balance being plant, machinery and equipment, Although, so far, we have attracted only a few more craftsmen, im. proved arrangements should lead to more output from Sandiacre this year. Continuing our policy of Installing the most modern machine tools and equipment, purchases amount. ing to Â£280,000 were made during the year. Since the end of the year, a further Â£37,000 has been spent and plant to the value of Â£113,000 is currently on order. When we announced the interim dividend in February of this year, we forecast that the profits to March 1967 would not be as high as those for the year under review, This I nbw confirm but It must not be overlooked that this year's profit is exceptionally high. I hope, when we announce our next interim dividend in February 1967, to give a forecast of the current year's results, Current Order Book Our order book Is still good and is still mostly for export but the outlook for large home orders over the next year or two is not so promising. The economic pliht In which our country i placeIs not likely to engender confidence for schemes of capital develop ment for some time to come. Furthermore, the unprlesednted rise in wages durin the past eighten months and tu e Ifnreases In costs which are constantly bing Iposed on us, cannot but have prejudld our competitive posi abroad. We ar, neverthaleu, using every mean n our power to Improve our productivity a to streamline our orn o for garter .ffclney.

This again has meant additional expense, which during this period we did not expect to recover, but which I am sure will be of great benefit to your Company in the future. Salaries #nd wages have risen during the period, but these have been absorbed by your Company, without raising prices of any of our products.

A aew platerboar4 plant, claimed to be one of the most modern in the world, was offii ially opened by Imperial Chemical Industries at its Severnside'works, near Bristol, to-day. The plant will be capable of prodpcing 13.5m. square yards of plasterboard per annum when in full operation, and an adjacent plant, which has recently come onstream, will have an anhual capa- 1 .0* '2C I-I<*(-. ________ city of 35,00Q tons of plaster. These installations, commit- sioned by ICI Agricultural Divi- sion. represent a major expansion of ICd's building products interests and form part of a Â£3.5m. pro- gramme to service the building industry, . The opening was performed by Mr. James Boyden. Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Public Building and Works, and 450 guests from the industry and asso- ciated professions travelled by air, coach and special train from London and other parts of Britain. Mr. Boyden said the new development, which he described as \"a 'masterpiece of modern technology.\" would help to remove the danger of future shortages- \"as in 1964 when there was such a shortage of plasterboard that there was a danger of distribution breaking down completely.\" Mr. Peter Trench. a director of the National Buiding Agency. referred to the effect of the Government's credit restrictions on the industry. \"The building industry in 1966 has not been singled out for special treatment--a treatment of switching off the tap.\" he said. \"This time they have turned it off at the main, at a time when the pressure was falling anyhow.\" He believed the Government was sincere in its endeavours to cushion the blow on building by increasing in 1967 the programme of work under its control, but he wondered whether the increase in the public sector would be sufficient to offset the indisputable decline in the private sector. \"I wonder if there has not been an underestimation of the effect of the financial and fiscal measures on our industry.\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "masawlmr . u Fire damang in August cost Britain Â£ 66,000 according to figures released yesterday by the British Insurance Association. This was a welcome improve- meat on the same month last year when the total was Â£6,424,000. It was only the second month this year that there had been a reduc- tion from the same month last year, the previous occasion being in February. Despite the improvemen, fires in the 12 months to the end of August have cost a record Â£8523m. or nearly 17 per cent, more than the total of Â£73.03m. for the previous 12 months. These figures, the association stresses, represent materipl damage only. They take no account of addi- tiopa damage to the economy caused by disruption of business, loss of production, frustration of exports and su like. Eurther e*vidnce of the growing number* of fires was given yesterdav by the release of figures relating to the London Fire Brigade. In the Quarter ended June 30 the brigade was called to 8,125 fires compared with 7.911 in the same period the previous year.",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN TO-DAY THERE IS a break in the Newmarket first October meeting, and the southern racing scene shifts to Windsor, where, with four handicaps on the card, winners are going to take some finding. However, it does look as though Golden Delight has an outstanding chance with 7 at 12 Ibs in the Richmond Nursery Handi- cap (2.30). This big Floribunda filly whom Sir Gordon Richards trams for Mr. R. F. Watson has run three times: first, when finish- ing fourth behind Social Bee, Fleet and Cornell at Sandown in June; next, when unplaced in a huge field at Newbury on August 12; and, finally, when winning a maiden race at Bath a fortnight later. She has considerable scope for improvement and could well develop into a top-class sprinter next season. Another sound bet on to-day's Windsor card is Osolts in the Twickenham Handicap (3.30). H. Leader's Newmarket string was badly hit by coughlhg during the late spring and early summer, but his horses are in great form now, and Osoils, who was off the course fMbm April 9 until reappearing at Yarmouth on September 15, ran well at the East Coast meeting when finishin third to Rennet and Terry Downes, and It is reasonable to assume that the race will have done him good, The running of Welshman, who had some useful sprinters behind him when finishing second to Fleece at Newmarket on Wednes- day, suggests that Sirius, on the 7 st 7 lbs mark, which weight will be reduced to 7 st 2 lbs by D. Mait- land claiming the 5 lbs allowance, will take a deal of beating in the Hounslow Handicap (4.0) for Sirius, after winning a sprint race at Goodwood in August, was runner-up to Welshman over course and distance at the last meeting here. Nevertheless, I slightly prefer the chance of Peep of Dawn, who could scarcely have been more leniently treated judged on the balance of form., At Haydock, Regal Light, though he has not lived up to the promise he showed last year, ran a rair race at Ayr the other day, and a rpe- tition of that form would probably be sufficient to ensure his victory n the Knutsford Plate (2.0) for three year-olds that have not won a race an 1966. And Manacle, who carried 8 it 13 lbs to victory in a good-class nursery at Ascot last Friday, is a confident selection for the Altrincham Plate (2.30). Finally it may be significant that P. Cundall is sendin Tropical Sk north for the Haydok Park tayrs' Handicap (3,30) and has engaged J. Sime to ride Mrs. Gay Kindersley's gelding.",

Mr. Dowden's statement that he was not very optimistic about the prospects for ettlng the Rbodsia problem was also a dampening inuaence, there was no lessening a the uncertainty cfused by the current troubles in the car industry, and the Gallaher statement came as a nasty surprise. The recent g6od tone in British Funds was not disturbed, however, and prics in this section went fur- ther ahead-by up to % in the short end of the market and by up to % in medium-dated stocks- and the Government broker fur- ther raised the prices of both his \" tap \" stocks. Other fixed-interest .tocks were also better again reUntly issued debentures and OQlns showing rises extending to a ll pOint after a big turnover and with institutional buyers in evi- dence, Industrials moved uncertainly, but with a bias to slghtly lower levels, in quiet trading.

Scattered features in- cluded Gallaher, which dropped over 3s on sharp disappointment with tbe interim report On the other hand, bid moves led to firm- nss in Barratt and Co. and in Tayslde Floorcoverings.

Forward sterling showed little change against the dollar--the three-month discount narrowing the merest shade to *. cent. French francs aain provided the day's most spectacular movements breaking through the official parity of Frs.4.9370 to the dollar-aud reaching alevel of around Prs.4.9460 at one stage, before recovering to close at Frs4.94175. Some support appeared to be given by the Bank of .France. Although no fully satis- factory explanation of the franc's weakness has appeared, It is thought that a less favourable balance on tourism, official dollar requirements and. the relatively low. interest rate structure in France have all played a part in the fall.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter A county court judge held yesterday that a company could not refuse became of the \" freeze \" to pay wage Increases already agreed. _ _. I .. u-C -e su pay wmay UmRSaaw mIn, UJ Iy w Judge Granville Smith at Edmonton (Middlesex) County Court gave judgment for Mr. Leonard Herbert Allen who sued his employers, Thorn Electrical Industries, of Enfield, Middlesex, because they refused to pay him an extra Â£1 a week from April 1 under an oral agreement of July 12 with his union, the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians (ASSET). The Judge said: \" Nothing I have heard today gives me any ground for saying that the defendants can be absolved from this contract.\" The Judge granted a stay of exe- cution for 21 days pending con- sideration of an appeal. Mr. Peter Pain, QC, for Mr. Allen, told the Judge that the case raised directly the question of what were the legal effects of the Gov- ernment's wage freeze. Oral Agreement Under an oral agreement of July 12, the company undertook to raise salaries of Mr. Allen and fellow employees by 5 per cent. from April, 1966, with a further 5 per cent. increase in April, 1967. Thorn's refused to implement the agreement, and would not do so unless ordered by the court. In their defence. Thorn's relied on the Prices and Incomes Stand- still White Paper, the underlying economic situation, and on a letter from the Minister of Labour, Mr. Ray Gunter, to the Confederation of British Industry of August 24 1966. Under the agreement, Mr. Allen was entitled to Â£1 a week more from April 1, 1966, and Thorn's contended that he was not, in any event, entitled to any greater sum as damages. \"The simple question,\" counsel went on, \"is whether this Â£1 is payable or not-whether by reason of frustration or public policy Thorn's are entitled to say\" we will not pay.\" Free Negotiations Mr. R. I. Threlfall. QC, for the company, said he would like to make their position quite clear. \"They made the agreement upon which Mr. Allen sues in free negotia. tions with the union. They would have honoured it without question but for supervening events. \"Withm eight days of concluding this agreement the Prime Minister made clear the view of the Govern- ment that this country was in the grip of a serious economic crisis and called for a standstill of all forms of income up to the end of 1966. \" Subsequently a memorandum was published with the authority of Parlia- ment which is now to be found in a statutory instrument made under the Prices and Incomes Act. 1966.\" ' Reading extracts from the White Paper on Prices and Incomes, Mr. Threlfall said that Part Four of the Prices and Incomes Act allowed orders to be made which, in effect, would make it unlawful to pay In. creases of the type referred to in the memorandum and would apply sanc- tions of the criminal law on employers who paid such increases. That part of the Act had not been brought into force. To activate it required an Order in Council and a period must elapse before it could come into force during which the Order must have been approved by resolution of Parliament. No Existing Powers \"The position is therefore that there are no existing compulsory powers to interfere with the operation of agreements falling within the memorandum.\" he said. \"But of course my clients were faced with the strong expression of view on the part of the Government that the country was in the grip of an economic crisis in which to pay the increase they had contracted for would be contrary to the national interest. \"As a responsible and major con. cern the company fell bound to respond so fir as i properly could to the equlrements of the policy which the Govnment was enunciating\" Mr Threlfall produced copies of Mr. Leonard Alien Mr. Gunter's letter to the Confedera. tion of British Industry and a letter dated September 14, 1966, from the Ministry of Labour to Mr. Bridge, Thorn's group personnel manager. Mr. Gunter's letter said.that it was most desirable that wherever possible deferment of wage increases should be achieved by agreement. \"Where this is not possible the overriding consideration in the national interest is the maintenance of the standstill and the right course is to withhold increases which would constitute a breach of the, standstill\" it continued. The letter to Mr. Bridge, written after Mrj Allen began his action, re peated that statement and added: This is to confirm that this general statement applies fully to the particu. lar circumstances of your company.\" Mr. Threlfall said: \"My clients have always been anxious to reach an amicable settlement with Mr. Allen and have carefully considered all pos- sible steps they could make which would not be contrary to Government policies. \" In fact, they did, with the sanction of the Ministry of Labour, make an offer to Mr. Allen for a deferment of the operative date of the increase and that offer had the blessing of the Ministry of Labour. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen's union did not feel itself able to accept- that offer. \"Therefore, one has the position of Mr.' Adlei \"stnoing upon what he asserts to be his legal right and my clients are faced with the expres- sion of Governmental opinion that the right course is to withhold in. creases which would constitute a breach of the standstill. \"My clients feel that it would be wholly improper for them to pay the increase unless legally obliged to do so.\" Talks Began in April Mr. Ernest Arthur Bridge, group personnel officer for Thorns, told the Court that negotiations with ASSET and another union began in April and were concluded on July 12. Mr. Threlfall: Was there any dis. cussion between you as to the possi. bility that the Government would call during the period of. operation of this agreement for a standstill on all prices -and incomes?-None at all. Replyin to Mr. Pain, Mr. Bridge said that there was no difficulty about paying the award except for Govern- ment pressure. He would not have started negotiations If the company had no Inntion of paying, In his natl speech, Mr. Threlfall submitted that courts should not aid persons to enforce claims where the Government had represented that enforcement would be detrimental to the public economy. It would give sich prrsonftan advantage over those wVo, In deferenceJo public Interest, acepited the sucrlce Involved. Mr, Threlfall conceded: \"Of coure, It is a cardinal principle of our lw that agreements are to be up,=hel, but he want on, \" thes. cirÂ¶ oumalenvva~I W1 Vl OV640111%a measures if the law is not to become an irrelevant bystander on the con- temporary scene.\" There were two ways in which parties to an agreement could be relieved of their contractual oblia- tions. The first was in the sense that the performance of the promise was diferent from that contemplated when the agreement was made. This was the doctrine of \" frustration.\" Become Unlawful This agreeent could be said to be frustrated because it had become unlawful, and contrary to public policy. Continuing his arguments. Mr. Threlfall saidthat there had been no suggestion when the agreement was made that the payment of an increase would be severely damaging to the national interest. Now the character of the obligation to pay the increase had chagd. Topay would be \"flying flat in the face of the considered opinion of the Government.\" The pay freeze as yet had no legislative force, but it was a founda. tion on which such an agreement as Thorn's if made to-day, would be unlawful as contrary to public policy. Mr. Threlfall said he knew of no legal authority where .the principle that something was contrary to public policy had been applied in relation to transient circumstances. He went on: \"You will have to decide to what extent public policy and political policy have the same connotation. 1 shall be drawing your attention to certain cases in which there is expressed the view that the political policy of a particular Government has nothing to do with public policy.\" He submitted that it was quite clear that in the vie~ of Parliament as well as that of the Executive, an increase in pay of this sort would be injurious to the over-riding economic interests of the nation. This is not a case where the court was called upon to do more than apply existing known principles of Rublic policy to novel circumstances. Change in Policy Mr. Pain, who called no evidence, argued that the conception of a sub- sequent change in public policy rendering a contract void in the course of its currency was contrary to legal authority. The conception that a contract was frustrated by a new public policy emerging was in law also entirely contrary to authority. Amid laughter, Mr. Pain said that Thorns would really like to pay the increase if they could do so without Soffedingi the Government. He maintained that judges would be reduced to \"mere pawns of Whitehall\" if they were bound to accept any statement in a White Paper whether or not it had the approval of the House of Commons. Mr. Pain went on: \"It would be subversive of our whole system of democratic Government. \"It may or may not be a good thing that Part Pour (of the Act) was not brought in immediately. Possibly outside the Armed Forces you cannot have compulsory volunteers. If the Government says that this should be done voluntarily for the time being then it leaves open the door to any. one to say 'these are my legal rights and I propose to insist on them. Clearest Case \"I would submit that this is the clearest possible case where public policy does not operate. If it be thought that public good demands it the Government should make a new law regulation or Order in Council dealing with the matter, Indeed it appears on the White Paper that Part Four was Inserted for that specifc uTh J udge: \"I am really being asked to bring Part Pour into operar tion and force Thorns to break their contract ?\" Agreeing, Mr, Pain saild \"You would be doing It in such s wy as to make Part Four unnecessary. The Judge: Yes I should be one ste ahead of the Government. The Judg adjourned the Court for ten minutes to onalder his Judgment. After the adjournment the judge said he found for the pluntlf, Mr. Allen, nd added \"Nothing 1 have hoeard today givsno any ground for Iayingl that the oerendanta can he absolved from this contract.\" \"In Ihis cae I have heard no evidence at all that the prfoomance of this nontraot would be dtrimental to public polio.

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON Mahler has been so much with us lately that it is easy to forget that his all-or at least much- embracing Symphony No. 3 was not played in England until 1962, S60 years after its premibre in Krefeld, and 66 years after its com- pletion. Since it is immensely long and needs an immense orchestra, boys' and women's choruses and a solo contralto, per- formances are never likely to be very frequent. When they come they usually make a deep impression on Mahlerians and anti-Mahlcrians alike, even on fence-sitters. It is *easy to love this symphony, or to dislike it intensely; hard to remain indifferent. The colossal first movement (the life force sweeping nature and mankind before it, not an abstraction of mankind but you and me and the works outing too) the five shorter movements that follow, surveying the rest of Sceation from flora and fauna to mankind again (this time with deeper aspirations), finally to spiritual fulfilment in God's love ,or what you personally will, invite violently positive or negative responses. The good and bad points of the performance were most clearly seen together in the last move- ment. Here the strings played with uncommon sweetness and the wind, at least during the first half, with more consistent confidence and precision than they had so far bhown. Silvestri conducted it con amore, yet he propelled the music in a series of affectionate spurts; this was nearer dreamland than spiritual fulfilment. A few fluffs and rough edges in a work of this site and complexlty can be overlooked easily enoulh if the drift of the argument is forcefully enough presented. Sit. vestri wove some lovely, closely- integrated textures (the scoring of No. 3 hasn't the searing, lacerat- ing quality of Nos. 6 or 9) and showed momenta of deep insight, as in the sudden, hushed panic that overtakes the third movement just before the end, but instead of building, he prodded and cosseted. Last night's performance by the London Philharmonic under Silvestri, though it produced some fine playing, made a rather un- certain effect because the conductor seemed too involved with detail to impose a strong view of the symphony as a whole. Clearly it had been carefully prepared. Equally clearly, the point had not been reached where Mahler's ex- posed phrases could be played with unfailing confidence. Many details were excellent (some of the most telling came from the leader, Rodney Friend) but too often woodwind and brass lacked firm- ness. The soloist was Norma Procter, happier with the angels of the fifth movement than with the solemn questionings of the-preceding one, where the orchestral background didn't surround her voice with enough depth or mystery. The angels' song was sung, adequately but not very brightly, by a section of the London Philharmonic Choir and boys from Ealing Grammar School.",

   "text_content" : "by JOHN HIGGINS Regular readers of this page will need little reminding that it greeted Charles Mackerras's\" em- bellished\" Figaro at Sadler's Wells with considerable enthusiasm when it was first seen eighteen months ago. Subsequent re- vivals have not dimmed that pleasure-in the musical side at east. Enough lines have been written already about this decorated, eighteenth century version, so it is now time to state that this FiIaro is not merely ornamented-it happens also to have developed into a firm, con- sident performance, full of life and vivacity. It is possible, and indeed neces- sary, to quarrel with John Blatch- ley's production on a number of points, and in particular over the 'cursory unmasking in the garden, but it would be d ifficult to devise a more lucid staging. Last night .every word was precise and clear cut, and those unfamiliar with clockwork mechanism of the plot, created by Beaumarchais and fined by da Ponte had only to listen to become enlightened. The current cpst has a number of newcomers among the cdm- prlmari and a fresh Countess. Margaret Curphey is a new singer to me, and on last night's showing she is a good dramatic soprano in the making. At the moment the movements are still lacking in fluidity and the face is insufficiently mobile, but the voice is rich and firm and blessedly accurate. During \"Porgi amor she was not quite at one with the conductor-more experienced sopranos have had similar difficul- ties-but \"Dove sono,\" which in its new position after the Count's Jealousy aria has probably changed more than any other aria under. the Mackerras in- fluence and has become corre- spondingly more difficult to per- form, was sung with a warm golden tone of autumnal regret. Miss Curphey is to be watched. Pauline Tinsley is now the Marcellina. On the surface it is surprising that she should suddenly appear in a character part, and a mezzo one at that. However, the signs have been that Miss Tinsley's voice is darkening, and Marcellina's Act 4 aria showed it much fuller at the bottom than the top. It was a good and unconventional inter- pretation, turning Marcellina into a spiky and faintly witty intriguer -\"And there stands your father !\" she shouts rushing across the stage -instead of the blowsy old body we are' normally given. Francis Egerton (Don Basilio), David Morton-Gray (Don Curzio) and Iris Saunders (a pert and girlish Barbarina) are the other main new- comers, and they are all well up to eht standard of their predecessors. The Susanna was also new to me -Margaret Gale. Hers was the most elegant and Mozartian per- formance of the evning. She moved as gracefully and nimbly as she sang; the face is pretty and re- sourceful at the same time. Here indeed is sprightliness and charm for the part, which is far too often taken by hardened and sophisti- cated sopranos. \"Deh vieni\" was dreamily and beautifully phrased, only once marred by a false note towards the end. The two men, Raimund Herincx as the Count and Donald Mclntyre as Figaro, have been the two unchanging elements of the cast. For my taste there is not enough differentiation in the voices to make this ideal casting, with the consequence that the social levels which are at the very heart of Figaro become blurred. But last night both were in fine fettle-sonorous, clear and dyna. mic. Margaret Neville, Sadler's Wells, resident Hansel, made a lively Cherubino, Marlo Bernardi has taken over from Mackerras as conductor and his interpretation is very much in line with that of his cast: brisk, precise and full of response to the spring and tensions of the score.",

   "text_content" : "Audlences, have changed, ilms have chanted, economies have changed, Hollywood hias changed; and the time will never come again when a child star can achieve the world-wide celebrity of Jackie Coogan, who at nine years old Was received in private audience by the Pope and by Mussolini; or of Shirley Temple, who at seven herself re- ceived in audience such varied celebrities as H. G. Wells, Noel Coward, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann and J. Edgar Hoover; and who drew frosm President Roosevelt (with whom she spent the afternoon) the praise: \"When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time, during this depression, it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents an American can go to a. movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles.\" The most successful child star of recent years was Hayley Mills; but her solidly professional career in no respect could compare with the hysterical worship commanded by Shirley Temple, and which swept her to the top of the box- office polls in 1936, 1937 and 1938. When Temple was ousted from first place, it was by yet another child star, Mickey Rooney, who remained America's top box-office attraction throughout 1939, 1940 and 1941. For six years, in fact, infants reigned over the American cinema; though the passion for child stars extended further back still, to Jackie Coogan's debut in The Kid. in 1920. The phenomenon of Hollywood's child stars in the 'twenties and 'thirties was uniqqe-not even paralleled by the \"Infant Roscius \" craze which swept the London theatre around 1800. The whole bizarre business is examined in affectionate, gossip-column detail in Norman J. Zierold's The Child Stars (MacDonald, 25s), a singu- larly readable book. even if its carelessness over incidentals (mis- spelt names, miscalculated dates and ages, loose references to \"Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Mirror \") occasionally arouses apprehensions about the accuracy of the more central information it offers. Unquestionably much of the appeal of the child stars was that of Dr. Johnson's female preacher. It is no good, for instance, making any claims to histrionic accomplish- ment or even consciousness on the art of Baby Leroy. who ies haved star billing a the age of about ten monthse a ete again t three; or for can achieve the worhcamld s-e celebrity of Jackie Coo.an, who Baby Sandy, who had a brief career at the end of the 'thirties, when she was under one-year old. Their only secret was innate baby charm, exploited by ingenious direction. Elsewhere, however, one must acknowledge certain skills and gifts, developed to an exceptional degree. Children do, of course, by instinct, act. Some do it better than others. Whatever sort of rubbish they may have appeared -in, the quite con- sciously affected pathos of Jackie Coogan and Jackie Cooper still do not leave us quite. invulnerable. Shirley Temple, whose complete professional competence and relia- bility was a byword in the industry, had her Method which could be a model for any grown.up performer. f\"What are we prending to-day? \" one-take Temple would ask her mother. And to explain what tran- spired after the question, she declared: \" Mummy reads the scenes to me, then I imagine the character and then I change myself character and then 1 change myself Freddie Bartbolomew ndd his Aunt Clale (above) and Shirley Temple (right) into that character,\" quite as if that were the only sensible way the thing could be done properly. Shirley Temple had, says Mr. Zierold, \"that essential ability to subordinate herself completely to the director's commands, to obey. \"Sparkle, Shirley,. sparkle,\" her mother, who was constantly on the set, would say, and Shirley sparkled. If the scene called for her to cry, she would cry. \".It's in the scrip,\" she declared when asked if she minded weeping. \"Crying is fun when you're not really sad,\" she explained. What did it do for them as people? The great difficulty .must have been:to stay people at all, in: the wholly artificial situation in, which they grew up. Remarkably, none of them seems to have been spoilt by success. Though the charm of little Shirley's vitality must sonetimes have wilted' as she hurtled on to the. set bawling: -'Here comes the armyl Boom! Bang! Bang!\", at which the tech- nicians were all expected to fall down dead, even her most improb- able colleagues admitted her ap- peal. , And the. rest of them seemed to retain through every- thing the human qualities which had no doubt constituted their original attraction. They faced up to the problems in different ways. Temple simply entered into everything as if it was a great game, living all the fairy tales she played in.' Deanna Durbin resisted her career solidly from the moment at. 14 when she greeted the proposal of a screen- test with sobs of.\" I don't want to be an actress. You're all.tortuting me\" to the joyful moment when her last contract ran out and she was able to escape. Others, like Garland, may well have inherited a lot of unhappiness from the over-work, over-exploitation and loneliness of infant stardom. Often it was the characters of the parents that iuffered from their children's success, While Gertrude Temple lived up to the image of the ideal mother that she had created for herself before Shirley was born, others were deeply stained by kreed and ambition. At 23, Jackie Coogan had to. bring a suit against his mother, and his stepfather, Mr. Bernstein, who clung rigidly to the conviction that every penny Jackie had earned was theirs and theirs alone. By the time the legal proceedings were over, there was no longer any money worth fighting for. Yet poor, bewildered Coogan never lost his adoration for his mother. The case of Freddie Bartholo- mew was even more grotesque. His parents were humbler than his later film roles suggested; and he was brought up by his grand- parents and. Aunt Cissie in War- minster. Aunt Cissic taught him diction and nice manners,' and had the foresight to 'persuade his father to sign away any interest in the child's possible earnings as an actor. Thereupon she vanished with Freddie to America, and the next his, parents knew was that their son was starring in MGM's David Copperfield (with W. C. Fields, whose experience as co- star with Baby Leroy had elicited the reply \"Pried\" to the inquiry, \" How do you like children ?). One by one the Bartholomews-- mother Lily, grandfather and grandmother, and finally Freddie's one-legged dad-made their way across the Atlantic to claim their priorities in the feelings (and earnings) of the little marvel. Miraculously Freddie pusued his career throughout a isries of 27 costly lawsuits. Less surprisingly, little if anything remained of his large earnings at the end of a nine-year career. As a Hollywood Aunt, Cissie Bartholomew was an exception. Behind practically'every other child star stood the shadow of a mother. One cannot but feel that these poor privileged, overworked, adored little creatures were being used to \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t fulfil their parents' own unrealised dreams, ambitions, fantasies. In return, of course, the mothers generally gave. them the fierce devo- tion and single dedication that lionesses give their cubs. In the few cases like Coogan's, where the parents later became false and grasping; it seems hore often than not to have occurred When new emotional interests entered one or the other's life, disrupting the mys- tic bonds between mother and child. And what became of them ? Not many stayed in show. business, though a few lingered on the edge. Some (Cooper, Coogan and Baby Rose Marie who plays in the Dick Van Dyke Show) have reappeared in recent years to make new careers in television. (They all remain com- paratively young, of course; Coogan, the doyen, is little more than 50). For others, collision with the realities of grown-up life proved harder. The Our'Gang films were before my timi; but Alfalfa Swit- zer, Froggy McLaughlin and Spaiky McFarland were still gay, heroic names of my childhood: But they grew up, as well as us. The real-life Alfalfa was killed in a fight over $50. Froggy. was killed on his motor scooter. Spank'y, when last heard of, was having a tough time of it, going, fom unsuccessful job to unsuccessful job. Golden lads and lasses .. except that they have over the chimney sweepers the small gift of immortality. The questions prompted by After the Fox (Odeon, Leicester Square) must become progressively more cruel: Is de Sica at a dis- advantage directing a film in English? Or isn't he very good at comedy? Or isn't he very good at all any more? The plot is not all that unpromising: a gang of excessively clumsy small-time crooks (favourite types in Italian cinema folklore) try to carry out a smuggling operation under covek of making a film. The comedy, however, is flabby and clumsy. The jokes at the expense of post- Antonioni film-styles are mean and sour. The sudden attempt in the last reel to give a serious point to the comedy is half-hearted and desperate. Comparing Peter Sellers' per- formance here (as the leader -of the crooks) with his admirably con- trolled and fuinny interpretations of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark indicates how much he benefits from the sort of purposeful direction that de Sica seems unable to give him. Unexpectedly. the single point of interest in the film is the performance of Victor Mature as an ageing, plumping movie star. In the past an actor of singularly restricted range, he brings a distinctive quality of tragi- comedy-outstanding in the con- text of the flaccid rest of the film -to the 50-year-old juvenile,whose frankness extends only as far as including himself in the over- forties. â¢",

   "text_content" : "It ik always an unpleaeatsiteek for the declaer, playing i a 44 trump suit, to ind that the five outstuadin trumps we in one hand. I watched such a hand a few days ago, when South dealt with NS vulnerable: N. *Q854 Q963 4AJ2 *AJ7 W. .E. S- *K7633 VAJ2 V10874 OK 10 98764 3 6952 *K64 S. *AJ109 (OKQS OQS *Q1083 Many purists would bid 1 club, but South opened the bidding with 1 spade, and I approve of her choice. Though the hand contains only 14 points, the high intermedi- ates justify a re-bid of2 NT in ith event of a 2 diamond reply from North. Over 1 spade West bid a pre-emptive 4 diamonds, North raised his partner to 4 spades, and all passed. West's opening lead of the ten of diamonds did not turn out well for the defence, but most Wests, aware of the bad trump split, would open their long suit. Of course the double dummy lead- is , the two of hearts, which gives the declarer no chance. As it was, South won the first trick with her Queen and led a small club, finessing the Knave, which lost to the King. East now made a defensive error by returning the two of spades. There are many occasions when it is right to draw two trumps for one, but this is not one of them. Hands like this require split-second timing not only by the declarer but by the defenders, in order to \" avoid an endplay of one sort or another. The balanced nature of Idummy, and entry to it limited to the Ace of clubs, should have warned East off a lead that loses a vital tempo. South won with the nine of spades, entered dummy with the Ace of clubs, and led a spade to her ten. The sixth trick was won by the Queen of clubs, and this was followed by the ten of clubs, on which a small heart was dis- carded from the table. East, after some thought, ruffed, and at long last led the four of hearts. South played the King which lost to the Ace. Now it was West's turn to make a blunder. Instead of leading. a diamond for East to ruff and-beat the contract, West returned the Knave of hearts to the declarer's Queen. Up to this point South had played very well, but now with the winning post in sight she faltered. All she had to do. was to play her heart, and ruff with dummy's Queen of spades, pick up East's trumps, and finesse the Knave of diamonds for hbr tenth trick. She ruffed with the eight of spades, and so could not finesse the Knave for entry back to her hand. This meant that East had to mike his King and beat the contract"
