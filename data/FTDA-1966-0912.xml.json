   "text_content" : "By Opr .Foreign Editor Mr. Harold Wilson clearly intends to turn down the African demnd for a British coimitmerant to no inde. pendence before majority African role in Rhodesia-now known as NIBMAR for. sho-r-when he addresses the Commonwealth Conference this morning. The Prime Minister's hope that the Africans may be satisfied by British concessions in the form of selective mandatory sanctions through the United Nations on certain products has not been realised, it is now apparent after the week-end discussions at Chequers. Although the Zambian Ministers boycotted the Chequers week-end, Mr. Arthur Wina, the Finance Minister, said that if the reports that he had heard were true, \" our stay is likely to be much shorter than we had anticipated.\" The Zambian Cabinet is expected to meet, possibly this afternoon, to consider Mr. Wilson's speech, and the danger of a walk-out now seems very real, although the other African delegations are unlikely to follow Zambia. The U.K. Cabinet meeting ont r Saturday morning endorsed Mr; a Wilson's policy of giving some I ground to the Africans in the I formt of selective mandatory I sanctions, but holding firm on f the NfIMAR issue. Mr. WVison'isspeeclr to-day is ex. peted to be' of such importance that the 6ther Prime Ministers will / ask for an adjournment immed. a iately afterwards.

In its'present form it says that the British Government would need to be satisfied that any basis proposed for independence was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole. It might be thought that the Africans in Rhodesia would not approve any independence settle. ment that failed to give them majority rule before independence, and that the Africans' demand for NIBMAR was therefore already implicit ini this principle. However, there is more than a suspicion that the British Govern ient, under strqng economic s n. so i of words now 9irc latln h ba sug\"ested ihat the views of the people of Rhodesia on the point should be ascertained ay demo. cratic procedures, so as to ensure that the will of the African majority would prevail. S. African Export Market One reason why the Africans will not be satisfied by the' British concession on, selective mandatory sanctions is'that it is still an imprecise and limited commitment. The British delegation is prepared to discuss the list of products on which sanctions would be applied -those being mentioned are Rhodesia's imports of oil, and -her exports of asbestos, chrome and pig-iron. But Britain is evidently not pre. pared to accept mandatory sanÂ°c lions of a kind which would in* volve a head-on clash with South Africa, In view of the importance of the South African export market. It would be difficult to secure South African compliance, with mandatory sanctions that were directed only against Rhodesia- but this is precisely the major loophole. in the present programme of voluntary sanctions., Britain may be more prepared to envisage limited sanctions affectin- Portugal, such as a ban on the oil that now reaches Rhodesia by rail through Mozambique.

The main reason has been the much steadier tone in copper prices. Any tendency to eae from the present level of a little below â¬400 a ton has been tempered by the fact U.S. demand for copper to meet its defence needs remains a high as ever. Lead and tin prices have also been steadier recently although in the longer run values are expected to drift lower.. Among other commodities, wheat and maize prices have remained firm as a result of the shortfalls in the U.S. crop and the world's growing food requirements. On the other hand cocoa, coffee, wool and rubber prices have moved lower-cocoa notably so following withdrawal of a good deal of the speculative interest which has dominated the market in recent months. Cotton, sisa and oil. seed prices have been fairly steady recently."

A statement along similar lines by the Lord President of the Council, Mr. Richard Crossman, produced a hostile reaction. Mr. Crossman, one of the few senior Ministers generally held in high re- gard by the Left. said that after the wage freeze ended the Govern. ment would still not allow a return to free collective bargaining. An \"Impertinence\" Mr. Russell Kerr, Left-wing M.P, for Feltham and a member of ASSET, the technicians' union, retorted on Saturday that such a statement was impertinence from a person whose experience was \"much more Oxford Union than trade union.\" He added: \"The idea that 9m. trade unionists will acquiesce and allow the Government to stamp on rights hard-won over genera* tions is something that may com- mend itself In the Cabinet Room but is a joke in bad taste on the factory floor.\" If Mr. Crossman's views were sbared by the Government.

In these circumstances Labour M.P.s will be particular, at the Brighton conference from October 3-6. to demand a clear idea of the Government's long-term view of the incomes policy. and the belief that the present restrictions were not in fact going to be temporary could increase resistance to the Government. Crucial Question The crucial question facing Ministers before the conference is whether to activate Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act. which would give the Government comrn-. pulsory powers to back the wages and prices standstill. Despite the advice of some of his principal colleagues, Mr. Wilson is reluctant to activate the measures-especially before the Labour Party Conference. He feels he is committed to introduc. Inp Part IV only if there is evidence that Important sections of industry are flouting the voluntary principle.",

   "text_content" : "By LEX Now that Town and City has laid its cards on the table the important point is how the other leading property developers com- pare. Potential problems are not hard to find. The freeze delays reversions this year. just when corporation tax will un- cover a lot of dividends, while pipelines as a whole need to be examined more carefully in the light of the building restrictions. Moreover, some shop develop- ments are becoming harder to let and with the present high level of interest rates it may well be that the old rate of return of 3% per cent. or more before tax on first- class shops or offices is just a happy memory. On the other hand, given that only part of the whole pro. gramme has to be funded at current rates the long-term average cost could be around 7 per cent.. suggesting that a pre-tax return of up to 3 per cent may not be unreasonable for the good boys. Strong Card This is one strong card Town and City looks to have. Its Â£27%m. of developments over the next five years could earn around 3 per cent. net which suggests earnings of up to 29 per cent., depending on interest rates in the future, and would put the shares at 7s 102d on a prospective earnings yield of over 7 per cent By comparison Hammerson can go one better. For a start, one point on earnings required develop- ments of just under Â£lm., earning 3 per cent. before tax, against Â£2.2m. for Town and City. Secondly the group starts with a covered-though only just-20 per cent. dividend, and thirdly it has a larger pipeline with firm develop- ments over the next six years worth over Â£50m. Finally, though Town and City has an enviable arrangement with the Prudential, the rate is not fixed which must make it hard work earning 3 per cent. on current pro- jects. Hammerson, however, has Â£14m. left of its existing arrnge- ments at 6Y per eant. the good chunk of itsjpalne is overseas and is being inanced there. In., way case, even if Haminersoa's whole prograimm earns only' 2 per cent. net, equity earnings in six years could rise to 55 per cent, putting Hammerson at 22s 6d on a prospectivye earn. ings yield of 12.2 per cent, a clear lead over Town and City. Between the Two In 'terms of income gearing, Aradale falls between the two. A point on earnings needs develop. ments worth around Â£l.lm. Where Arndale suffers by comparison, however is that Its pipeline of firm projects is only Â£14' %m., including the Â£2%m. Australian scheme due to become income. producing in 1968. Secondly, though the total is covered by existing arrangements, It is difficult to see Arndale earning more than around 2 per cent. pre-tax on aver- age, which means an addition of about 8% points to earnings. It is true, converting last year's profits into a suitable form for corporation tax suggests pretax profits of around Â£525,000 and thus the .16 per cent dividend is already\\ virtually covered. But the prospective earnings yield of 7 per cent. at 17s 10%d is just short of Town and City, which is by no means so committed to shop developments. What, then, about the daddy of them all, Land Securities? Here the obvious problem is that with an equity capital of Â£30m. de- velopments have to be Â£16sYm. before earnings move up a point Thus Land Securities' pipeline of Â£40m. is in fact basic rations for the group, adding only around two points to earnings. Nor does Land Securities appear to get much help from its revere sions in the next five years. The trouble is that in the early 50's it was common to give' leases of 35 years or more and the number of shorter leases coming up for revision before 1970 is relatively small,,and confined on the whole to less remunerative shop properties. Thus even though the forecast for this year is a covered 7% per cent. dividend, it is hard to see more than about three points to earnings coming in over the next few years. This leaves the shares at 17s 4%d prospectively yielding 6.2 per cent. and leaning heavily on hopes that Land Securities can sell off its low yielding properties to stop it running out of steam. Ready Mixed The Ready Mixed Concrete report is bullish about long-term prospects, but does not enlarge upon the immediate problem-. Compared with last years 18 per cent. dividend, earnings were only 142 per cent, and it is reasonable to assume that 1966-67 will be another difficult year. In fact, Ready Mixed is better placed than it looks at first sight The point is that the group's good geoaplhical s Ppread-over OQ depots sd more to come this year -mecans that it can redistribute its capacfty rbund the coustry as l a conditions dictate Thus while it i pulling in its horns in the South, where the damage was caused last year, it is expanding in Scotland and the North-Bt whre demand is still buoyant This manoeuvre should mean that over. all sales will go on rising, and margins improve this year. On this basis' pre-tax profits could run out at over Â£2m. against Â£l1.6m., giving earnings of 19 per cent. after as supernormal a tax rate as last year's, Though this gives Ready Mixed at 13s 6 a 14.2 times prospective p/e ratio which is not particularly exciting, the 6.8 per cent yield ls better than the building materials average, and Ready Mixed already has the capacity to double output when the clamps come off demand See also Page 12",

   "text_content" : "The 36th Annual General Meeting of Ready Mixed Concrete (United Kingdom) Limited will be held on 6th October in London. The following is an extract from the statement by the Chairman, MR. W. R. Norarcorr. cir- culated with the report and accounts: In January this year I was pleased to accept your Board's invitation to become Chairman in place of Mr. Bryan Kelman who was released from his duties at his own request to return to Australia. It was hoped that Mr. Kelman, who had done so much to bring our Company to its present stage of development, would continue as a member of our Board. However, owing to pressure of commitments in Australia he found it impossible to do so. I regret that my first Annual Statement does not report a continued increase in profits. The year has been a difficult one both at home and overseas and almost all the countries in which we operate have experienced in varying degree economic restrictions of one sort or another. During the second half of the financial year the reduced level of sales compared with the anti- cipated demand, particularly in the United King- dom, together with an unusually wet spring in all our main areas of operation prevented us from equalling last year's trading result. The Group trading profit for the year fell by some 18% to Â£1,618,717 (1965 Â£1,966,186) after considerably increased depreciation provisions amounting to Â£1,794,282 (1965 Â£f,265,551) Although based on overall lower profits the taxa- tion charge of Â£604,843 (1965 Â£596,661) has also increased over the previous year due principally to the withdrawal of investment allowances during the year. After allowing for minority shareholders' interests the profit for the year available to ordinary shareholders amounted to Â£870,028 (1965 Â£1,230,063). In March this year we paid to you an increased interim dividend of 11 per cent. less income tax in order to take advantage of the provisions of the Finance Act, 1965. Your Directors now recom- mend a final gross dividend of 7 per cent. making a total of 18 per cent. for the year, thus main- taining last' year's rate on a considerably increased At this early stage it is difficult to assess the full difect of Selective Employment Tax on our Group. Preliminary calculations indicate that the cost to us of this new tax will be in the region of Â£70,000 per annum. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES United Kingdom The building materials industry, of which your Group is no inconsiderable part, has been encouraged to expand rapidly in recent years to meet the continuously rising demand, only to be faced with a procession of curtailments and defer- ments of constructional work and serious delays in the housing programme. As a result, we have found ourselves in some areas with excess pro- ductive capacity and diminished profit margins. This position will be rectified in time, and mean- while we shall endeavour to increase our share of the available work. Group sales of ready mixed concrete were in excess of six million cubic yards in the current year and we have increased our percentage of the national market from 27 to 30. Although our capital investment programme has proceeded at a lower rate than previously, the number of plants owned and operated by the Group rose from 182 to a total of 202 at the financial year-end. We have also continued to expand our sources of raw materials, both by way of development of existing supplies and through acquisition of new reserves, and output this year has been increased by over 30 per cent. Our precast and prestressed concrete opera- tions have experienced a sharp reduction in demand from the civil engineering industry - * ** : * ' * *r 't althoughb it Is hoped that further intensifed sales efforts coupled with technical improvements to the extensive factory lraies at Norwich will enable Anglian Buildig Products Limited to contribute lgnificantly In the future to the profits of your Company. In this connection it is com- sorting to observe that present economic difficulties have so far not affected Local Authority interest in industrialised housing schemes, and Improved trading results are being shown by lor Woodrow-Anglian Limited, our joint undertaking with the Taylor Woodrow Group in the production and erection of industrialised dwellings. Wedter Germany With the development of the industry in this country competition has increased but nevertheless we have expanded our turnover and trading was satisfactory. Production has risen by 35 per cent. and the plants operated by your subsidiary and associated companies now extend from Kiel in the north to Munich in the south. Amitae Although in the last few months this country has experienced credit restrictions, the local man- agement is to be congratulated on having achieved a large increase in both turnover and profits. Our output now represents over a quarter of the national market, and we are continuing to expand our productive capacity. Italy Trading conditions in the north have not improved. Although we have done everything possible to improve the efficiency of our operations in this area, the continuing low outputs and margins have resulted in a further trading loss. The Rome Company has been faced with inten- sified competition but in the year both turnover and profits increased. Israel The Government has continued to apply deflationary measures in this country resulting in a fall in building activity. We have, however, managed to increase our outputs by 23 per cent. and although margins have naturally been affected our operations here continue to be profitable. France Although we have increased our output by over 100 per cent, trading results have been dis- appointing. We are, however, confident that the difficulties encountered to date can be overcome and that this investment will make a useful con- tribution to the Group's profits. Trinidad Trading conditions continue to be similar to the previous year yielding a small profit. No further extension to our activities on the island is planned at present. CONCLUSION In a period when the building industry has suffered a recession in trade, I have been greatly encouraged by the robust and enthusiastic spirit of the executives and staff of this fine group of companies. All are extremely disappointed not to have been able to report another record year; nevertheless, the strenuous efforts each and every one is making must eventually be rewarded by improved financial results. Your Company is in a strong financial position following the rights issue in February this year and the arrangements made with our bankers foi foreign currency loans. As soon as there is an indication of an upturn in the building and civil engineering industries, the capital programme will be accelerated to ensure that our Company mainp tains its position as the world's largest ready mixed concrete producer. i'ii .* r---' ^ -'\"^^,~~",

   "text_content" : "TU' 47th Annial General Meet- tg -of Gabriel Wade & English Ltlted was held on September 9 In London. M.IL TromAs GAsIm L (the Chairman) prsiding. The following Is his circulated statement: Twelve months ago in my state- ment to you I emphasised the diffl& culty in.assssaing the effet that Governentat credit restrictions would have on our turnover dur- ingthe year under review. In fact satle have not suffered, although in the last few months of the year demand for buildin and construc- tional timber has shown a distinct falling off through the curtailment of many private building projects. Profit margins, however, have been seriously affected by- (1) intense competition through weak sdiling generally of the heavy timber stocks imported into the country for the expected bunding expansion which never materialised; and (2) constant increases in over- heads which we have been unable fully to recover. AeeOute e4 ba Mdi It is therefore principally through the modernisation and diversification programmes we have undertaken during the last few years that I am able to report to you results which.I trust you will consider satisfactory under these difficult trading conditions. Profit before tax amounted to Â£405,133, this being lower by Â£126,53, or 24%, than the record figure achieved in the previous year. Taxation on profts takes Â£152,169 in this first full year of Corporation Tax for the whole Group. The year before, the total tax burden was Â£256,596, income tax being then retained' on- divi- dends paid. The effect is to leave a net surplus of Â£261.635 as-against Â£275,090 in 1965. Transfers to general reserves have beep made from revenue to a total of Â£78,500, and a further addition of Â£41,305 to these reserves has arisen from a sale of surplus land by a subsidiary.in March 1965. Having regard to all these factors, your Directors recommend a final dividend on the Ordinary Stock of 9%, The previous year payment was at the rate of 10%, and, as the interim dividend this year was increased by one point to 5%, the total distribution to Ordinary stockholders in each year will be 14%. Capital Expeadltte Expenditures on apital account throughout the Group amounted to some Â£240,000 during the year.

This statement, coming so soon after 'the Government's drastic measures to slow up the economy, may possibly have caused me to take an unnecessarily pessimistic view. However, for- wird commitments for stock are light, so we are as well placed as we can be to combat the problems i that may lie ahead.

MAcKeNZaE (the chairman.) presiding. -A te eottr ft h te circulted (tehmant thf mi&t-eari nuu ad! that the eompay had bretntjected to a niost severe profit fluctuation despite the fact that they had started the year with every confl- 4 e that tb pat rate of growth. wud be Imatasned. The major of th rat reduction had eit ti *holesale division, where a massive reorganisation and rationalisation programme had been undertaken. Mr. MacKenzie continued: This has been completed and' oar national operations are nowcartlied out by six regional companies in- stead of more than twenty. At the same time a programme of con* densing conventional wholesale operations from thirteen of our depots down to four depots was also in progress. These moves are now in the past, and although the cost has been great in terms of loss of profits and great in terms of management strain, the ultimate effect on trading should be ex- treamly beneficial to efficiency and profits. Referring to the Manufacturing Division, the chairman said that the margarine and edible fats divi- sion had again made the most sub- stantial contribution to profits against a background of consider- able price fluctuations and a shift in the balance of world supplies of raw materials. Considerable expenditure had been incurred in improving the \"image\" of their canned goods under the \"Village\" and \"Royal Norfolk\" labels. The range was now comprehensive, new products had been introduced and a substan- tial increase in sales had been achieved. However, promotional costs and the restraint on price in- creases combined to produce a smaller net profit than the previous year. Mr. MacKenzie went on: Our wholesale conventional distribution coverage of the United Kingdom is now almost complete and unless exceptional opportunities present themselves we shall not need in the future to acquire other businesses for expansion, as this can be gener- ated adequately from within. Your Board is confident that although the group experienced a setback in its profits last year the steps that have been taken will pre- vent the recurrence of the type of losses we suffered. - At the time of the preliminary announcement of profits and dividends, I stated that profits for the first three months of the current financial year showed an increase of some Â£50,000 over the same period last year. A large part of this increase was attributable to the wholesale division and although there have been violent fluctuations in sales, I hope we can maintain a reasonable increase for the remainder of the I ep eat adopted.\" __",

To bring the Company's issued capital more into line with the assets employed in the business, the Directors propose to make a capitalisation issue of One Share for every Five Shares held on 23rd August, 1966. The shares will rank par passu with the existing ordinary shares except that they will not participate in the Final Dividend for the year ended 30th April, 1966.

A feature was the softening in the French franc to its lowest levels against the dollar since the inrruduoc tion of the new franc in 1960. Among the reasons for this reported to have been put forward officially in Paris, vwere pending by French tourists, pur- chases of U.S. equipment, general commercial demand, and the mterest rate situation.

   "text_content" : "Financil time Reporter Procedure adopted by Courtaulds in carrying out Uts expan. sion in recent years is eantlio ed by Mr. A. W. Knight, th. finance director, in a paper to the lastitute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. In deciding which firms to approach, Courtaulds preferred to rely upon its own efforts, states Mr. Knight, whose paper was to be presented for discussion during the week-end to the Insti- tute's 14th Summer School at the University of St. Andrews. The selection of possible acquisi- tions had thus to be made by study- ing available commercial informa- tion and the Moody cards. As regards getting into touch, various channels might have been used but it was soon decided to approach directly the chairmen of those companies in which Courtaulds was interested. As the company's activities became known, it began to receive approaches from Boards who were willing to consider offers. Mr. Knight continued. \"Of course, this method intro- duced a strong bias towards contact with those companies which had difficulties and the problem was to decide what these really were and whether they could be accepted as possible to deal with. It also naturally made the subsequent investigation processes all the more important\" Before spending too much time on investigations, he went on, \" it is normally better to arrive at some agreement on the terms which might be acceptable, on the basis of information which can be made available easily and subject to any evidence which might emerge from the investigations.\" In dealing with accounting matters Courtaulds changed its methods a* experience was gained. SIt was Sound that the reports from independent accountants did not add anything to the informa- tion we could get from investiga- tions by our own staff. Mr. J. L. Kirkpatrick a chartered accountant, presented a paper deal ing with a new Com anies Act. He suggested that t\"e sharehoe should Ideally be given by his Bod financial staements from -which domestic detail has been exised and in which is set out, with clarity, suffi- cient information as to make evident not only the bald money'& worth of profts, dividend and finandcal sial- tion but also a qualitative meaure ment of pirformance. \"This is the task and duty of the accountant tesponsible for 'the preparation of accounts for the use of shareholders. So far as is practicable the statute governin contents of accounts should providei a series of rules with this objective in view; to the extent that rigid ruling would be undesirable, account. ig practice will and must assume this responsibility.\"",

Representatives of the various regions and of the federal territory of Lagos open a meeting here to-morrow to discuss the future of the Republic, which has been badly shaken by army revolts and communal riots. Although the Eastern Region has agreed to send representatives to this crucial meeting, the names of its delegates are still being kept top secret, and they may not arrive until a few hours before the meet- ing opens. This shows the extent of fear for the personal safety of easterners, even -at this decisive reconciliation conference. The general feeling in the country to-day is one of apprehen- sion, and nobody has a ready answer to Nigeria's probletis. What then are the prospects for this meeting? The answer seems to lie in compromise-which has become Nigeria's characteristic approach to the settlement of grave national issues. The presence at this meeting of great advocates of federalism and a united Nigeria-Chief Obafemi Awolowo, just released from prison; Sir Kashin Ibrahim, a former Governor of Northern Nigeria; Mr. Joseph Tarka from Tive Division; Chief Anthony Enahoro of extradic- tion fame: Dr. T. 0. Elias, former Attorney-General in the Government of the late Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa--gives an assurance that attempts will be made to preserie the Federation at all costs. A likely solution may be for each existing region to make some sacri- fice by agreeing to the creation of more states. Fortunately, the North is known to have agreed in principle, and to be prepared to make conces- sions at this meeting. All eyes will, therefore be on Chief Awolowo, leader of the Western Region delega- tion, because he appears to be te only man whose opinion and judg- ment will be accepted as unbiased and realistic.",

The need for a new city in th East of Ireland, backed by at aioptr transportation and communications route from Londonderry via Belfast, Dublin and Wateiford to Cork, was the main theme of the paper by Robin Walker, vice-president of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, given here at the annual conference of the Royal Institute of British Architects. 'The conference was inaugurated in Dublin to-day by Lord Esher, RIBA president. It is being held at Trinity College. Mr. Walker envisaged in the South-east a major development embodying a \" concentrated section of the eastern metropolis,\" a linear expansion of the existing major cities along their existing route, forming with the intervening small towns and villages one continuous urban field. Western Region The West of Ireland he saw as a Western European international park, devoted to tourism, with the existing agricultural potential being encouraged at the same time. Mr. Walker considered it essential for Ireland to industrialise itself with the help of fast surface com- munications with Europe; and also, of equal importance, by the early establishment of direct surface- transport links within Ireland's boundaries. Coming much closer to-immediate technical problems, Mr. Donald Bshop. of our own.Bulidipg Research Station, considered the relationship of Architects and Productivity. He criticised the present building industry which he considered as *'stll adapted to bespoke construc- tfin 'base,' a craft practice.\" Mr. Bishop considered that thoughtful design might lead to buildings that were easier to build, by eliinnating difficult wdrk and increasing the type of work that could be done without interruption. But the necessary design refinements should be an essential part of the professional competence of every practitioner. They demanded an intimate know- ledge of building operations and the feel of materials and formwork almost sakin to that of a craft. It was not at all certain that a build, ing designed to be easy in building would be so regardeq by contractors estimators when pricing their' bills of quantities. \"Tendeting documents should en- able estimators to identify quickly the implications of a design from the standpoint of construction.\" Mr. Bishop underlined the import. ance of this when he added: \" If this _I I is not so. contractors may not be able to differentiate between buildings that are cheap to construct and those that are not and there will be little en- couragement for designers to develop building types-system or conven. 4ional-miat are easy to build.\" A number of cases were quoted where advanced or partly mechanised operations were tried out against con- ventional practice, sometimes to the advantage of convention. Investiga- tions of new components, he con- tinue should be made to determine the effect on preceding work and the requirements for accuracy and special fixings. Innovation \" Innovation,\" concluded Mr. Bishop, \"almost always produces a faster tempo of work and creates a different relationship between con- tractor and suppliers, between em- ployers and operatives and between individual gangs.\" All these circum. stances demanded effective operational control of resources. The conference continues until is I t-marrow afternoon.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By RAYMOND HEY EDITOR, P POWER INTERNATIONAL The fluid power indfstry is based on the fact that a liquid or gas under pressure may be used to transmit power and directed to operate a linear or rotary actuator. Since this form of power 'is readily controllable and, can be piped to the appro priate actuators without the need for mechanical linkages, excep- tional flexibility of construction and operation are possible. Modern fluid power systems nor mally function using either mineral oil or air and the equip- ment used is classified under the general headings of oil-hydraulic or pneumatic. Although both hydraulic and pneumatic systems may be used to provide linear force or rota- tional torque each may be regarded as a separate techno- logy. Most companies in the fluid power industry specialise in either hydraulics or pneumatics and this situation is reflected by the fact that two trade associa- tions serve the industry. A very large proportion of the firms concerned with the manufacture and application of hydraulic equipment are members of the Association of Hydraulic Equip- ment Manufacturers, while the interests of the companies in the pneumatics side of the industry are furthered by the British Compressed Air Society. Hydraulic power systems are pressurised by some form of pump driven by a prime mover. Since, for most practical pur- poses, oil is incompressible such systems are ideal for transmitn ting large forces smoothly and providing precisely controlled actuator movements. Pressures used may range from a few hundred to several thousand pounds per square inch, accord- ing to the application and type, of hydraulic equipment em- ployed. System pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. are now fairly common while equipment operating at higher pressures than this is in regular use. Main Categories In recent years there has been a steady rise in system pressures and in the development.of equip. ment to produce and handle them. Further progress in this direction is likely and this :hould extend the potential for applying hydraulic systems and Iprove tbeir competitiveness. The main'broad categoriles of hydraulic application are indus. trial,'mobile, marine and avia. tion. In the industrial field a very wide range of machinery employs hydraulic equipment, including machine tools, presses,, mechanical handling equipment, plastics machinery and mining. equipment. In. particular hydraulics is making an im- portant and increasing contribu- tion to rhachine tools where it provides an ideal method for moving tool slides and work tables with great precision. More recently, the introduction of numerically controlled machine tools has been assisted by the development of electro- hydraulic servo' systems which can be readily controlled by a programme tape. Under the heading of mobile applications can be included the expanding range of earth-moving equipment, tractors and com- mercial vehicles. The truck industry, for example, is now using hydraulic systems for many more ancillary operations such as tipping, power loading devices and the interchange of different body forms or loading platforms. Here the scope is immense since it is becoming increasingly im- portant to improve the work utilisation time for all vehicles. Recent Strike Marine engineering is another sector where the demand for hydraulic systems is expanding. Already the steering and stabilis- ing of vessels is undertaken hydraulically as standing prac- tice, but many other oppor- tunities exist for using hydraulic systems on board ship. The recent strike of British seamen focused attention on the vital need to improve productivity at sea and such equipment as remotely - controlled hydrauli- cally-operated deck and anchor winches, ship's cranes, hatch covers and gangways can all contribute to this. Hydraulic motors, with simple and reliable methods of variable speed con- trol, areii ow offering a serious challenge to conventional elec- trical methods. Due to the current difficulties of the British aircraft industry, the demand for aviation hy- draulic equipment is not likely to expand'appreciably. Never- theless, it must be acknowledged that reliability and performance of 'industrial hydraulic systems owe much to techniques de- veloped, for producing the sophisticated systems used on aircraft. The Peregrine hydraulic television camera crane designed for operation by a two-man crew sitting side by side. Apart from very small air- craft, all current military and civil aeroplanes use powered fly- ing controls which incorporate hydraulically operated actuators with high response servo systems. Companies engaged in this type of work also have industrial hydraulics divisions so that much of the technical know-how acquired in the aviation field is being employed to serve the engineering industry generally. Power Source Pneumatic equipment uses compressed air as the power source and the manufacture of compressors is a major activity. Last year the value of air and gas compressor production exceeded Â£40m., but in relation to fluid power applications this figure is misleading since com- pressed air and other gases are used in industry for many pur- poses. Pneumatic systems usually operate at pressures not exceeding 150 p.s.i., and this type of equipment offers many advantages where it is required to operate low- and medium- powered actuators. Using pneumatic equipment many manual tasks may be per- formed rapidly, simply and cheaply so that such systems are being applied increasingly in all industries where low-cost auto- matic operation is needed. In production engineering, simple pneumatic systems are used for e ding components into machine tools automatically to eliminate the need for hand loading. Pneumatic cylinders and motors can also provide the power for traversing slides and toolheads on the smaller type of machine tool where only mode- rate work and tool loads are Involved, a typical example of this type of application being the conversion of a hand-operated capstan lathe to an automatic machine. Another branch of production engineering in which pneumatics ji making an Important contri- buton is that of assembly. Air A oubleas hlylrelatIl am mdrl glu Ito 08 I O wwlo od PwW JMk&.

While production engi- t neering has been singled out as f having substantial potential for I the wider application of pneu- a matics, very broad scope exists I for improving productivity in f many sections of industry by applying this form of fluid e power. An important development in i the fluid power industry is the recent introduction of practical c fluid amplifiers to perform switching functions. These fluid logic or fluidic devices, which have no moving elements, can be arranged to perform control sequences in a similar way to that of electronic static switch- f Ing units. c One of the important advan- t tages of the fluid amplifler is that its performance is un- * affected by environments which t might impair the efficiency of i an electrical device. Fluid logic f Is a rapidly expanding techno- f logy and it seems probable that It will be widely adopted for certain control functions during ' the next few years. In particu. c lar, there is considerable scope t for the application of fluidica to r process control, and work is t already advanced on fluid logic C systems for controlling natural * gas pipeline and pumping Instal. . Iationa, r Industry's Growth [ Many companies In the fluid a power industry supply a high i proportion of their output to the r original equipment manufac- t turers so that the prosperity of v the industry must be related to a that of engineering generally. Reliable statistics covering the output of hydraulic and pneu- matic equipment in Britain are not available, but in recent years growth in the fluid power industry has certainly been above the average expansion rate for the engineering industry as a whole. Developments in fluid power systems have meant that this type of equipment is now used more extensively on many classes of machinery, and this trend should continue. Evidence for optimism comes from the United States. A recent survey showed that between 1957 and 1964 the output of the American fluid power industry increased by 55 per cent. to a total in excess of $750m., against a general industrial growth of 31 per cent. for the same period. During this period the number of establishments producing fluid power equipment increased from 283 to 363. Direct Exports Direct exports of American fluid power equipment probably do not exceed 7 per cent. of the total output but a number of the larger .US. companies have established manufacturing plants in Britain and Europe. In addi. tion, many companies have licensing arrangements to manu- facture U.S. products in this field, British companies have, how- ever, also made an important contribution internationally to the development of both hydraulic and pneumatic equip* ment and leading companies in the industry have important overseas subsidiaries and valu- able licensing concessions for some of their products. Fluid power systems have made and will cont nue to make a major contribution to increas- ing Industrial productivity. The adaptability of this form of power to 'an ever-increasing range of applications ensures that the industry can look for- ward confidently to continued expansion.",

   "text_content" : "Air as a power medium has the great advantage that it is ol free and universally available. It ca is not surprising, therefore, that pi compressed air power, recog. nised for its versatility in manu- p facturing and construction, con\" a tinues to enlarge its areas of use b even to such diverse applications v, as surgery and beer dispensing. c In order to cover a wide de. d mand, the compressed air indus. 3' try provides an extensive range u of types and sizes of compressor n in the form of either a station- t ary or portable machine. All M have one characteristic in com- n mon - reliability - for as a i source of power the compressor r must have this inherent quality v or the . processes depending upon it, come to a standstill. Among industrial users there C is a: substantial requirement for c stationary compressors capable of delivering air at pressures up to 1QQ p,s,S.g, and less fre- quently up to d0 \"Vp.i..g. These are generally reciprocating mahbbies of varying capacities and characteritics, ranging c frot a single stage air-cooled r compressor to drive a dentist's i drill, to .a double acting two- a stage water-cooled compressor j delivering thousands of cubic a feet per minute to operate an c automated complex of mechan- ( isms in a car plant or glass 4 works. In specialised cases, for example polythene production, i multi-stage compressors may be I used to provide for pressures up 4 to 45,000 p.s.i.g. I Other Groups Other groups of compressors having wide applications are rotary ones of the vane, screw and liquid ring type. These to a limited extent compete with' reciprocating machines. Positive displacement, turbo and Roots blowers all provide low pressure air, while centrifugal and axial flow compressors are used for high to very high volumes which may exceed 100,000 cubic feet per minute. For specialised duties, such as pumping corrosive gases, diaphragm compressors are available, and where small quantities of oil free air are needed, for example in fluid logic, the smaller type of diaphragm pump has a suitable application. By adaptation most forms of stationary compressor are capable of working as a vacuum pump or exhauster. The principal users of the portable compressor are civil and municipal engineers and the building industry who need volumes from 50 c.f.m. to 1,200 c.f.m., and the garage and decorating trades calling for 2 to 30 c.f.m. While the latter group use mainly reciprocating machines, the compact nature of the rotary machine, its fewer working parts and reduced maintenance costs, has enabled it largely to replace the reciprocator as a portable plant for capacities in excess of SO c..mn. The reliability of the vane type of oil flooded rotary compressor has come. to be universally accepted and the Lysholm screw rotary has more recently joined its ranks. Total Volume The total annual value of compressed air equipment manufactured in Britain at present is about Â£72m. Of this, some Â£41.m. comprises air and gas compressors and exhausters, and the remainder consists of pneumatic tools, control, circuitry, spraying and drilling equipment. ' Of the total annual volume of air compressors the substantial figure of Â£17m.-that is, 41 per cent.-is exported on to world markets, the Common Market taking Â£7.7ni. The total annual world exports of compressors is currently running to Â£105m. with a British share of almost 16 per cent. A predominant trend now Is to design for higher speeds, aiming at compactness and simplicity, but always maintain- ing the reliability of the lower speed machine. Demand con- tinues to grow for oil-free compressors in which a piston with carbon rings (frequently fluon impregnated) runs in a dry cylinder separated and free from the crank-case. These compressors are used for instru- mentation, surgery, food, drink and chemical processing, and wherever the presence of even minute quantities of oil are critical.

WATSON MARKETING MANAGER, BROOM AND WADE UMITED 40 ft The Broomwade V350, which supplies compreed air throuaghout the new Berk Resarch and Development Centre at Harlow New Town, where a pecil ring-main system with feeder lines allows power to reach the arious lahoratories. I have promoted the greater use of pressure die castings and f technological advance in syn- 1 thetics has widened the applica- r tion of injection mouldings in I the compressor. All of which t have contributed to cutting j machining costs. ,s Considerable thought is con- i. stantly being given by the it designer to the silencing of air compressors. Although the 18 Wilson Report recommendations have yet to become mandatory, j the portable compressor market is widely offering machines which conform to the appro- priate standards of silence. SThroughout the more sophisti- cated sections of the world n market demand is expected to y increase for a fairly stringent I standard of silence. S Two Aspects d There are two aspects in :n reducing the cost of compressed -e air: first, the manufacturer has to design for the optimum out- ts put of compressed air for the minimum input of horsepower* and running costs. Intensive world competition ensures a constant incentive among, design teams of the major International manufacturers to strive after advantages in both performance and economy. The second aspect to some extent devolves upon the user. At the earliest planning stage consultation with the compressor manufacturer on installation lay- out and plant utilisation can in- variably result in the greatest economy by a careful study of peak demand, future develop- ment and the rationalisation of different systems of power. A simple and permanent economy accrues from a well- designed and carefully main- tained ring main installation. This helps to minimise wasteful leakage and pressure drop by the appropriate choice of air line equipment and pipe sizes. It is a generally accepted rule that the more compressed air a unit employs gainfully, the cheaper it becomes. minimum innut of b6maaawer--",

   "text_content" : "By C. E. CUNLIFFE DESOUTTER BROTHERS LIMITED More and more manufac- turers are finding that in the pneumatic tool they have one of the most adaptable, reliable and durable means of cutting production times, trimming labour expenditure and creating something of a minor revolution in workshop and production-line practice. The reasons for this interest are neither obscure nor compli. cated. Ppneumatic tools are ex- tremely light in weight and can be used comfortably by female workers without inducing any suggestion of operator fatigue. They are generally smaller, easier to handle and less diffi- cult to use in confined spaces than their electrically motivated counterparts, and-because of their power source and conse- quent immunity to the dangers attendant upon arcing, spark- in, insulation breakdown, elec- t .Il mrrlo1adin At - thu Are also safer and more reliable. Furthermore, they are virtually indestructible-even with the roughest conceivable handling- and are unusually flexible and versatile in application. Driving Gears Also, by modifying the ratios of the epioycll driving pars and adjusting the air pressure, any one tool can be made to run at any consistently maintained speed and give any desired torque over a wide range. Nowadays, although the portable role is still extensively employed, it is becoming In. creasingly common to see quite complex and highly Indivi- duallied bench-mounted set-ups and multiple tool arrangements on jigs and fixtures-sometimes fully automated but mostly In the semi-automatic form, where a degree of operator particlpa- tion is still required, and for the moment, desirable.

The special machine t( used was designed from the u outset to undertake several I different jobs throughout its life. P The particular advantage in t' using this type of auto fee drill equipment s the ease with which b relatively simple units can be produced and the fact that almost all of the items can be \" adapted for further use at the end of the total run. In this t instance the number of opera- a tions was cut from 10 to two n and the hydraulic check feed on i the 1 mm drill has reduced breakage considerably, i Assembly Lines The motor-car industry is well c placed to take advantage of f seml-automatic equipment and a particularly on engine assembly j Ilne.

   "text_content" : "DBy D. IRTH HEAD OF THE FLUID POWER SECTION, NATIOiNAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY A recent report on fluid power systems equipment issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce shows that shipments from the industry are now topping the SI,OOOm. mark. In the year be- tween 1957 iand 1964, the period coved the report, while total ndustrial production during this pearod gained 33 per cent., shipment of fluid power equipment increased by 55 per cent. The largest dollar gams for tha period -were in pumps, 4 cylindrsp. : a valves, and aocouted aoralmost 70 per cenato the total thipnieats, WBhitablhd poweemotrs (an mi s), wed a' smaller increase in value than these items they, in fact, showed the largest' percentage increase of 176 per cent This implies that although. hydrostatic transmis- â sions are still a small part of the 1 fluid power industrial output, it c is growing rapidly. There are c no comparable statistics for a Britain for the snam period and t for the same industry, but most tl people concerned would agree a that the pattern is roughly the same. While it must be admitted that there is a steady demand for hydrostatic transmission in'cer- tain industrial areas, there is no a doubt that quite a substantial V part of the present demand is M associated with \" one off \" appli- p cations. conversions and proto. yrpe developments. Conversions a and prototype developments are U comparatively expensive, and as a result-a clear case for fitting , kydrostatic transmission is not always immediately apparent. In Imany instances the case for fit.- ting a transmission is established b by derivative attributes such as ease of operation and of drive. flexibility. a (CatreTr observations of: the results of a conversion over a ti period of time can,. however, ih (tablsh a case for' a hydro- d static transmissiow which would ti Inim ti amount - at eWwk done per vnit i.w Par eia omprsid wfit a dumprw with a Mcbm\" att.bnt not show in theshbort term. For instance, the National Engineer- ing Laboratqry have demon- strated that a 35-cwt dumper converted to a hydroptatic drive can show an increase in the amount of work done per unit time of up to 30 per cent. over that from a dumper with a mechanical gearbox. Lower Costs Further work is continuing in order that maintenance charges over a period may be compared with those of dumpers with mechanical transmissions. At the present time maintenance charges on mechanically driven dumpers are concentrated mainly in the upkeep of clutches and brakes. As the hydrostatic transmission is clutchless and brakes are not required for normal operation, the functional case for fitting a 'hydrostatic transmission which has already been established, is expected.to be reinforced by the achievement of lower main- tenance costs. : The present phase of utilisa- tion of hydrostatic transmissions industrially can therefore be defined as promising but traosi- tional. Emerghig from the r transition are a few positive attitudes which may well influence future development. r One of these is that hydrostatic e transmissions might be matched e more satisfactorily both in terms of performance and first costs r if more were known in greater a detail about the application. In an automobile gearbox, for instance, the life of the first gear under continuous maximum load could be measured in hours, a yet because of the way it is used s in a vehicle it gives an effective I life. At the present state of the art, few manufacturers would e feel confident about providing s hydrostatic transmissions within s such narrow design margins. The unit provided would more . than likely be capable of giving a anything from 500 to 1,000 hours t under maximum load conditions , which is clearly uneconomic a designing. A deeper knowledge of design criteria in hydrostatic s transmissions and a more a realistic grasp of the eventual application would reduce the risks in providing infrequent high peak load, and should ensure economies in first costs. There is evidence in the industry that movements in this direction e are taking place. Because hydrostatic mashines automatically involve close clearances and high unit load- ings, materials tend to be exotic and costly. Substantial develop- ments are in progress which, without sacrificing desirable life, can cheapen the costs of the material used in transmissions. Sot instance, an'axial piston unit made entirely of mild steel has been runningfor 12,000 hours at 3000 lbf/in2 and 1500rev/min at the NEL and is still running satisfactorily. The use of such Ssimplified materials has reduced the cost of this unit by at least 30 per cent. One of the most interesting developments in the future is, however, the growth of a design philosophy which says that the best exploitation of a hydrostatic drive is going to be found in the integration of the driving elements as essential parts of the parent machine. In such cases, instead of applying separate standard units, pumps, motors, valves with their attendant mass of pipes and fittings, the trans- mission would be designed from the start as an essential part of the machine. Not only does this approach tend to reduce the size of the total machine and thereby reduce the cost of materials and of machining, but it enables other \" bonus benefits \" of hydrostatic transmissions to be exploited. Stepless Range Two exercises, both applied to machine tools, have been con- ducted at the NEL. The first of these is an 18-inch centre lathe with hydrostatic trans- mission wrapped round the lathe spindle. This machine not only gives a stepless range of speeds, all controlled from the saddle of the lathe, but gives, automatic- ally, constant cutting speed with changing diameter. The drive, which is combined with hydro- static bearings, gives a rounder product, with a better surface finish than the convential equiva- lent and also shows useful reductions in product time. The other application, which is a cylindrical grinding machine, shows a superior per- formance and a lower level of vibration than is normally found in such machines and is very economical in the space it occupies. Machine Design By accepting that the design- of machines might be dominated by hydrostatic drives, as indeed conventional machines are dominated by their mechanical drives, the future might show substantial simplifications in machine structures, particularly in machine tools designed to ex- ploit numerical control. The growth of this design philosophy implies that designers outside the fluid power com- ponent industry will eventually command the techniques of designing fluid power com- ponents with the same sort of facility with which they' at pre- sent design gear trains, clutches and conventional bearings. On the other hand, some component manufacturers might, in close collaboration with machine manufacturers, produce items suitable for integration. It seems a reasonable predic- tion, therefore, that the use of hydrostatic transmission will continue to grow in the manner presented in the U.S. Depart- ment of Commerce report; that some manufacturers may broaden the base of their pro- ducts to produce items suitable for integration directly in their machines and that designers out- side the fluid power industry will increasingly command the tech- niques necessary for the success- ful integration of hydrostatic transmissions in new and, possibly, novel machine struc- tures.",

   "text_content" : "By M. J. FISHER THE BRITISH HYDROMECHANICS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION Fluidics is a new technology which is concerned with the control of fluid power by \" valves \" with no moving parts. Several diffhrent fluidic devices have been developed. A typical example is the jet interaction amplifier which utilises the do. flection 9f a jet of fluid by two smaller control jets. With equal control flows the main jet divides into two equal streams each passing down an output channel. Unequal control flows deflect the 'jet, causing more fluid to enter one channel than the other. The difference between the two output dfow is greater thst and %proportional to the dlffrence in control flows. Another proportional device is based on the increase in flow resistance when a Jet Is induced to flow in a vortex, Digital devices whose output pressure is switched from one level to another are based on the tend. ' ency of a jet of fluid to cling to a wall and the change of a jet I from laminar to turbulent flow. I Since fluid amplifiers con* sume power continuously, their use as power controller is limited to modest power levels directly and high powers through an ,intermediate conventional nowr control. They can be used n surement, amplifoation n and loc sytemp. They will be competing in areas where pneu. I matic, electromecanical and k slow speed electronic equipment Is used at present.

   "text_content" : "By F. DODOSON TECHNICAL DIRECTOR, CHURCHILL-REDMAN LIMITED The present generation of machine tools use hydraulic power as their muscle. When large slides have to be moved against heavy cutting loads, or when small mechanisms have to be operated in a precise manner, hydraulics are usually selected as being the best medium. High load capacity can be concentrated into relatively small hydraulic cylinders for linear motion, and compact hydraulic motors can be used for rotary motion. A central source of hydraulic power integral with the machine tool is used. This consists of a tank containing hydraulic oil, with a hydraulic pump driven by an electric motor, located on the top of the tank. This unit is capable of supplying oil under pressure at any point on the machine tool. Typical Unit By using this fundamental ,advantage, the machine tool designer can adapt hydraulic power to give a machine tool great, versatility, and the capa- bility of exerting heavy loads in a compact area. If hydraulic power is the A numerically controlled turning machine where all information for machine operation is stored on punched tape. if muscle of the machine then elec. ic trical power is the control n system. Hydraulics require pre- d cise control, and this is easily or obtained by solenoid operated o control valves, electrical limit r, switches and associated electrical is control devices. A typical hydraulic control P unit as used. on a modern u machine tool may consist of a !r tank and pump unit and the ic control valve assembly. These . valves comprise solenoid- y operated directional control valves, pressure relief valves, ic pressure reducing valves and le sequence valves. All the inter- ,f connecting piping is behind a il, panel and all the valves are iy gasket mounted on to manifolds ie so that they can be removed is and replaced without disturbing .r the piping. ie The machine tool designer and hydraulics engineer work to standards which are principally concerned with two factors, l safety and ease of assembly and maintenance. These are ?I American JIC standards and are Ic closely observed as a guide to ol good design principles for a- machine tools. in One of the inherent advan- tages of hydraulic power is that le it enables a high load to be operated by a small controlling p force. An example of this is in a the Servo valve, which enables v a force of a few ounces on a I handwheel or lever to control a t load of several tons. The only a connection between the valve v and operating cylinder or 1 hydraulic motor is the inter- v connecting pipes. Servo Cojtrol a Other modern developments d include high production machine a tools which use hydraulic opera- e tion and electrical control. An a example of this is a production profile turning lathe.which auto- matically produces circular com- ponents using a replica of the \" parts being produced as a master. This type of machine I produces parts for motor-cars,. tractors, earth-moving equipment and the like, such as axle shafts, crown wheels and pinions and gearbox shafts. Servo control C is used, so that a tracing finger t can follow the master which is 8 positioned at. the top of the I machine, while hydraulic cylin- ders control all slide movements. Machine tools are becoming more sophisticated for many : applications and hydraulic t power is still the best method of obtaining even greater forces which are now b required. However, the meabs 6V 4con- trolling this power is becoming more exacting, and even more precise methods are beia used.- The` eWlect6hy< Yulnt 0 valve is ah r e1*ie of valve enaof controlled with t\"iat in prporif t altb intl an electical a feed-back e I dt .'of abiditV,-Z b r dista -Oef. mot used in numnrioallhJ Ibti machiine tools whe M ments are controlled ro punched tape. Th& heart of the system isthe Servo loop drive unit-the link between the, numerical control' and the machine tool. This power pQit consists of a hydraulic motor to provide the torque to rotate a r-circulating ball inut and screw, an electro-hydraulic Servo valve to provide the control of the motor, and a feed-back unit attached to the end of the motor to provide the feed-back loop of rotary posi- tion and also velocity of rotation. The units operate the movement of the various slides on the machine, and in the case of a turning machine where continuous path control is utilised for the cutting tool, all information for machine opera- tion is stored on a punched tape. Automatic Pumps In the future hydraulics will be used to an even larger extent on machine tools. Trends will be towards a miniaturisation of valves and also there will be trends towards reducing the amount of piping work involved. One of the problems in hydraulics is the generation of heat which gives a varing vis- cosity of the hydraulic oil, and this in turn leads to instability problems in the hydraulic system. Automatic variable delivery pumps are now becom- ing available which will, con- siderably help this situation. This design of pump only provides the necessary volume of oil in order to maintain the system I pressure, and therefore does not generate unnecessary heat by 1 pt mping oil to waste which is nbt required. Standardisation of cylinder, valve and pump siaes is now bIboo ing essential. This has bee es utableshed in America for lj'sote t gii, and Is now just I > begniflnag l this country. The cU i i .

The ^\"~c . *' *- *^ inch system on pipe threads is used universally at present and unfortunately, therefore, the change would entail a consider- able cost without much advan- tage. < Ease of maintenance . of hydraulic equipment, accessi- bility and interchangeability of all units, also the correct appli- cation of hydraulic equipment is a function of the machine tool designer. It is a function of the hydraulic industry to ensure that the hydraulic equipment is available for the designer to achieve his objectives.",

   "text_content" : "By JOHN IRWIN MANAGING DIRECTOR, VICKERS SPERRY RAND LIMITED It has been said often enough hat good system design is issential for efficient operation >f hydraulics. But a good ystem design, though essential, s not enough. A vital step is 'electing the best method of building the system. This has a nost important influence on re- liability, ease of maintenance. and hence on the profitability of nvcstment in new machinery. The buyer of an expensive numerically controlled machine tool rightly demands that It can be operated for a 24-hour day, and the hydraulic control system nust be capable of being main- tained with a minimum of down. time. How can the method of execu. tion ensure that these objectives are obtained? First of all, we must look at the inter-connection of the components in the system. This can be of flexible piping,. and sometimes has to be where parts move or are subject to vibration. But hoses yield under pressure, and so reduce system stiffness; hoses are subject to chafe, are expensive, bulky and entail the use of fittings which create a pressure drop. Rigid Piping Rigid piping has low pressure drop characteristics if it has good fittings, but the need to respect minimum bend radius re* quirements can make a complex system bulky, In addition, special care has to be taken to clean and pickle tubing so that scale is not left in the a stem to cause damage. Also, pI -work is essentially a manual sll, and as such is tending to become less and less economical in compari, son with machining operations. When components have to be removed for servicing, the system has to be opened up by breaking the pipe fittings, and skill is needed to make sure replacement is satisfactory. These are Important considera. tions in high-volume poduction plants wBere dow .nime ls critical, For th ysol rmnifolding In beinaope aI Ith way to con eat components in a hydraullo system where maxi. mum reliability and ease of maintenance are prime con- siderations.

In the case of solenold valves, I plug-and-socket connections for the leads can make it unneces. Ssary for an electriclan to be called in as well as a fitter.

But If the execution is to be good enough to yield the reliability, ease of maintenance and minimum down-time of which hydraulics are inherently capable, it must be carried out with the same attention to detail as the circuit design. This calls for a high degree of speclalist knowledge and eperience. _1_Â· ~ 1 _",

   "text_content" : "If the biggest potential threat to the world's monetary peace lies in the possibility of the British Govern- ment's latest special measures pro. gramme falling to achieve a last- ing revival of conddence in sterling, the next biggest is to be found in the possibility of. as accentuation of unrest for the dollar provoking a massive run-down of the huge balances with US. banks other countries have accumulated in recent years by absorbing the pro- ceeds of persistent American pay. ments deficits. So the recent operation whereby Italy succeeded in quietly unloading a substantial Part of her excess dollars through i triangular deal arranged with the U.S. and the Fund is of considerable general interest For, besides demonstrating how unwilling holders of dollars can be provided with a means of escape that will not expose them to the charge of having rocked the international payments boat. it should also serve to bring to light just how extensive the pent-up demand for dollar convertibility really is. As recently as the end of 1960 the American gold reserve exceeded the total of the country's short- term commitments in foreign currency. To-day it is equivalent to little more than half these obligations. This would not itself necessarily be a matter for concern if there were no serious prospect of the relationship continuing to weaken. But uneasiness on this account has not been wholly eliminated by the measures the U.S. authorities have taken to rehabilitate the country's basic pay- ments position during the past two or three years. Consequently, the behaviour of the American bank- ing system's short-term commit- mnents continues to be of hardly less importance to the world's pav- ments well-being than the be- haviour of the U.S. gold stock. In the first half of last year, as it happens, the total of such obliga- BY LOMBARD .U.n .I h, :. a- -- - lions did show its first appreciable contraction in many years. the end- June figure being around S1,000m. below that obtaining at the close of 1964. This movement actually reflected conversions of dollars into gold at the expense of the U.S. gold stock. But it is the case that. even if there had been no such switching; the upward movement in short-term commitments would at least have been halted in this period-a marked improvement on the situation -prevailing in the two preceding years when a yearly increase averaging some $2.000m. was recorded. Advance Resumed Unfortunately, since the middle of last year the upward movement has been resumed-which is partly. of course, because the U.S. pay- ments position has failed wholly to maintain its early-1965 improve. ment but also because of the com- parative success the U.S. authorities have had in preventing the deterioration finding expression in gold losses. And the latest avail- able count relating to the spring months of this vyear shows the total some S1,600m. beyond the mid-1965 level at some $25.600m. However, the problem this might have presented to the U.S. authorities has been materially eased so far by the fact that the new upward movement has found expression mainly in additions to private-as opposed to official- foreign holdings of dollars. Taking commercial bank balances and other private balances together, the latest figure of S12,000m.-odd is some S,300m. beyond the mid- 1965 level. Official dollar balances, by contrast, are higher by only some $300m., which means- that they are still some $700m. below their end-1964 peak. The problem of. excess dollar balances-that is, foreign dollar holdings which the owners would convert into gold were it not for the fact that in doing so they would add significantly to the U.S. gold reserve worries-is, concerned, broadly speaking, only with official balances. So the present situation Is. in numerical terms, no worse than that which existed at the close of 1964. But the possibility ofrn explosion being touched off at any moment by a rush to unload the excesses has obviously not been eliminated. It could, for example, be snarked off by a tendency for foreign holders to expect a cut in the value of the dollar in terms of gold as the U.S. gold stock moves closer to the figure of S10.000m. the U.S. authorities are thought to regard as a basic mini- mum-and it is still heading in that direction. So anything that can be done to provide a safety valve through which any pent-up demand for dollar convertibility can escape without accelerating the drain on U.S. reserves is clearly going to be a valuable aid in stav- ing off the danger of such an explosion. The triangular deal arranged last month between Italy, the U.S. and the IMF does just that. Under it, Italy effectively converts $250m. of her excess dollar balances into a gold-guaranteed claim on the fund aid S250m. of U.S. indebtedness to a foreign central bank is given the more innocuous form of S250m. of indebtedness to the Fund. There are, of course, limits to the extent to which the pent-up demand for convertibility implicit in large foreign holdings of dollar balances can be neutralised in this way. For one thing, such operations entail adding to American drawings on the IMF, seeing that the U.S. pays in dollars for the foreign currency which the Fund lends to it to enable it to buy back the foreign central banks' excess dollar balances. Complications mig.t arise therefore, if the process were develope4 to the point of pushing U.S. drawings from the Fund beyond the automatic and semi- automatic tranche limits-that is, to the extent of more than about SI.500m. Light on Unknown There is the further point that pot all the countries holding excess dollars would find it as easy as Italy to carry out a deal with the Fund whereby part of their foreign exchange reserves were con' rted into a claim on the Fund. We have not, after all, yet reached the point at which claims on the Fund are regarded as exactly the same thing as reserves in the till. And while this is of no consequence to countries like Italy with reserves so large that they hardly know what to do with them, it is an entirely different matter for those in more straitened circumstances. However, there are quite a number of countries that have exceptionally large reserves con- taining very large dollar elements. They can hardly be refused the opportunity to unload part of their excess holdings of dollars on to the Fund that has been afforded to Italy should they wish to avail themselves of it. So it should now be at least a little easier to prevent the pent-up demand for dollar con- vertibility sparking off a potentially dangerous run on American gold reserves. The interesting thing will be to see to what extent these holders of swollen dollar balances seek to avail themselves of it. For this will provide some indication of the importance of one of the great \"unknowns\" in the inter- national liquidity equation-which concerns the extent of the demand for gold in place of reserve cur- rencies that is currently being frustrated by. Washington's efforts to keep the convertibility of the dollar informally and indefinitely in suspense.",

   "text_content" : "Mr. Harold Wilson's reply to his African critics this morning will be the turning point of the Commonwealth Primne Ministers' Conference. Although it is still possible that Zambia may leave the Commonwealth, the danger cf the organisation breaking up as the result of a mass African walk-out has receded. Most of the Africans have understood that melodramatic threats to get up and go, particularly if they are never carried out, would only play into Mr. Wilson's *hands by diverting attention from the real subject matter of the debate on Rhodesia. \"Nibmar \" The Africans, supported by a big majority of the whole Com- monwealth, want two things from Mr. Wilson. They want a clear British commitment to \" NIBMAR \"-no independence before majority African rule in Rhodesia-and they want sanc- tions to be toughened up by making them mandatory in the United Nations. Most of them are realistic enough to recognise that the use of force by Britain is effectively ruled out; Zambia puts more emphasis on force than the others because she is suffering so much more from the economic backwash of sanc- tions. But Dr. Banda of Malawi brought the discussion down to earth by pointing out that even if Britain did use force, there was no guarantee that it would succeed against a white popula- tion many of whom are des- cended from the Afrikaner guerrillas of the Boer War. The Africans have recognised that the economic crisis puts strict limits on Britain's freedom of manoeuvre; Mr. Wilson told them that Rhodesia has cost the U.K. balance of payments Â£80m. since UDI. Any change in British policy must try to avoid adding significantly to this rate of expenditure. A commitment to NIBMAR might appear at first sight a grand gesture that could be made on the cheap. But, by effectively ruling out any possibility of further talks with the Smith regime, it prolongs the expense of sanctions, and. by postponing the date of indepen- dence, it commits Britain to her expensive responsibility for Rhodesia for years ahead. Mandatory sanctions would also be a burden on the balance of payments If they were allowed to escalate into a British boycott of South Africa. A compromise is possible on both the African demands, although it is now more clearly in sight on mandatory sanctions than on NIBMAR. The British Government has smartly picked up Mr. Pearson's idea of selec- tive mandatory sanctions on Rhodesia's exports of minerals and imports of oil, as a logical development of the existing voluntary sanctions on these commodities. Britain evidently intends to propose measures to the United Nations which would avoid any head-on clash with South Africa; although this might make the new sanctions less effective in the short run, it could also lessen the risk that Pr. Verwoerd's successor may turn his back on world opinion and side more openly with Rhodesia. On NIBMAR, the clash be- tween Mr. Wilson and the Africans looks more difficult to resolve. Talk of compromise forms of wording in the com- muniqud is vitiated because the African mistrust of the Prime Minister stems precisely from bis ability at past conferences to keep his options open by devious prodigies of the drafts- man's art. Mr. Wilson is un- likely to give much ground on this point to-morrow, but be will be under pressure on it for the rest of the week. He must * try to avoid going so far to meet the Africans that he cuts off any further possibility of talks with I the Smith regime. If some of them refuse to sign the com- muniqu6, it will not mean the break-up of the Commonwealth; it will only mean the frank I recognitionr of a difference of views which has been apparent for some time. Effect on talks Mr. Wilson's best defence is I that the Africans' two demands -for mandatory sanctions and t NIBMAR - cannot be con. t sidered in isolation from one t another. Sanctions against the Smith regime and talks with ii are two halves of the same i policy. The aim of intensified e sanctions must be to force y Rhodesian concessions in thd * talks; but if a British comnmit r ment to NIBMAR causes thi r Rhodesian attitude to harder 1. against talks, sanctions will have ) that much less chance of sue f ceeding in their political objec 1 tive. The Africans may noi t thifk much of British policy; bul they cannot suggest any feasible i alternative.",

   "text_content" : "BY J. D. F. ONES, OUR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT NOW IN SOUTH AFRICA D R. VERWOERD has been q laid to rest in the Heroes t Acre in Pretoria, the r assassin lies safely in jail, and the parlikmentarians of the National Party bha flown back t to Cape Town to an. imposible I task-the choice of a successor. -a To-morrow the 166 Nationalist I MPs and Senators will meet in s Capetown in caucus to elect 4 their new leader, and thus the new South African Prime Minister. Five Cabinet Ministers have been mentioned, but the choice a will almost certainly fall on one I of two men-Johannes Balthazar t Vorster, the ruthless, inter- nationally notorious ex-Nazi, only 51 and Minister of Justice, Police and Prisons; or Ben I Schoeman, a comparative moder- 1 ate and a well-liked though tough administrator, who is 1 61 and was .a Transvaal engine- driver before rising to become I Minister of Transport. Vorster 1 seems to be in the lead but I everything will rest on the final bargaining sessions of the Party bosses to-day. If, however, the caucus hesi- . tates, or if it looks round once 1 more for a third man it will be understandable-their task is an 1 impossible one because Verwoerd is irreplaceable. There is a nation- wide awareness of this fact: people of all races simply cannot understand what South Africa will be without him. Verwoerd's great genius was that he led the Afrikaners-a profoundly con- CV6ti00 ppri-4rto a revolu. ai awit.o ever letting them real0se lt.0 H pl t, forward a y sotiotn to South I*er tolw 4Ir l ma, n*othing If~r .tbitr'' t *imuember the ubUicit a imber of black an white staswhbih would, he b .eve be held toither a a sort f e oaof Souther Africa. Washing Away Guilt Just before his death he had started the second stage of his programme: the drawing into this confederation of South Africa's black independent neighbour states. The charm of Verwoerd's solution was that for the whites it seemed to comr bine intellectual rigour with moral worthiness, whereas before, in their heart of hearts, they bad had the guilty suspicion that their prosperous supremacy lacked either intellectual or moral justification. Verwoerd offered to wash away this guilt but he never frightened them away by revealing the price they were to pay for their shriving. For tV'- last few years, Verwoerd -a lonely, solitary figure- must have kept constant watch for revolt within his party. The revolt came, but slowly, con- fused by deliberate imprecision of Government policy, and in the election earlier this year Verwoerd smashed with impres- sive ease the right-wing objectors of the Republic Party in the T'raivaal and the Fropt lI Natal,- - , , t \", Meanwhie he wais tuisu th ame skillto ary hi Cabinet hiteim In thfcautifb but real iprlewtotttKWo f teti. it ^. ^ 11 ) ,* THe MALOI CQNTKEN-*RtS Venter Schoeman was a consummate performance and no one else could have done it. This background is essential to any assessment of the future course of South African politics because Verwoerd died too soon. Not only is his revolution far from complete; in the absence of an heir there is still time for It to Cbeoohedw d and evaen .vo4 It i* possible to arg of 01f1r0e. tat :not even VtTo ul^ have completed this reMvtio,. or that it was phoney sdi that 'Â·' ;- . * ' L - * he never meant it to be more than a convenient way of per- petuating Baasskap. Whether or not this is true, it seems clear that Verwoerd never appreciated the most powerful argument of his critics-that the forces of economic development would n i rs It 1. Yr as It s hty si ly a1 Â· make nonsense of his \"separate op , freedoms.\" But he must have ho , realised that one day his people ge Swere going to wake up to the thi , implications of his quiet revolu. sh t tion. Many of them were going th: to get unhappy about the high .lai , cost of Bantustans, the evasion of job reservation in the border A! industries, or the sort of partner- ex ship with the Blacks implied in at the honoured reception of cc African Heads of Government ist iW Cape Town. w Critical Period M Verwoerd had had to move fe Sslowly and he had only just got to the critical period. A great deal of planning has been done fr but the implementation has only It just started (there is only one A Â» Bantustan,' for example). With Verwoerd gone, will the vision and the drive be lost? Verwoerd w knew he now had to press ahead and brush aside objections even from within his, party. The temptation for the Cabinet now h is to 'stand still, to consolidate if L not actually retrench, to keep the d Transkei as a show place and d remain Bass throughout the S *country. The choice of successor si is so obviously crucial. Ben t Schoeman might appreciate the a a logic of Verwoerd's thinking- h Sar I as head of railways he must c Sunderstand the absurdity of job p Seservation-but has he the c ds power and the drive and the ei f genius to continue leading South d Africa along a path which even i Verwoerd could never dare stake o * out too clearly? There is no N reason to think so. i iF Then there is Vorster, a man Take nonsense of his separate op whose preoccupation has always N been with power, order, authorake up to the ity and security. It is difficult to see this hard-faced man bringing himself as Verwoerd did (and Verwoerd was also a racialist and extremist when he took over) reto shake the hand of c Leabuas Jonathan, lot alone truly t desire to lead the Africaptions of 1 Southern Africa to a better life. t In a crazy, South African way, Verwoerd was a radical. Vorster t could never be. Schoeman ist got just a moderate nationalist. At I man like the new Defence Minis.e ter, P. W. Botha, could juWith I conceivably fill the need, but he I is too young and Verwoerd had no time to train him as his suc cessor as he probably intended.ow Unique Qualities Under Vcrwoerd South Africa was like a stan who dreamed a mad dream, yet began to make d it livem; with his death the country. Thas woken up too soon , and the dream is lost, Verwoerdhinking- t had other unique qualities. He must dominated the Cabinet for ex. ample, so much so that the word \"reservdictator\" might almost be the appliower and to him. Schoeman canthe not conceivably do this particu.ake larly s-too clf he Th elected- is no Senator de Kerk will have put T him there. Vorster might have I the temperament to be a dcta-hor tor but he will need time to in only one respect could Vorster step straight into Ver. I woerd's shoes. Verwoerd was an I International symbol of racial international symbol of racial oppression and Vorster has riun him a close second. Thdre is a general feeling in South Africa that if Vorster gets the Premier- ship then pity help the Liberals that are left and the English to . anguage press. So the Government in South Africa will cease to be an expression of Verwoerd's dream and will become more like the consensus of Afrikaner National- ists. The result may be in some ways more moderate and less aggressive (particularly if Hilgard Muller has a free hand at foreign affairs) but it will also probably mean a concentration on holding the line, in other words policy will move back from radicalismtowards reaction. It will also be less interesting. t' Another sphere in which Ver- woerd had extraordinary talent was foreign aztairs. Despite his international reputation Ver- I woerd had kept open the lines of communication with the West and had also accepted Hilgard Muller's advice to stay in the United Nations despite the domestic desire to quit. Even during the worst crises in Anglo. 0' South African relations it was pos- sible for London and Verwoerd to talk like civilised men on Rhodesia. For example, there has been an unmistakeable appre- ciation between London and Pretoria of each other's diffi- culties and a moderation behind the South African Government which came from Verwoerd him- self. The change will surely be noticed. It is easy to imagine \" Wilson and Verwoerd discussing Rhodesia by telephone. The mind boggles at the thought of s Wilson and Vorster debating how to restrain- lan Smith. Political Change ,t Most important of . all k Verwoerd died in the middle f of the most significant political y transformation since Afrikaners f left the Platteland. White poli- . tics in South Africa were about r, to see the development of a r massive governing party of the s centre. It was to have been led k by Verwoerd and the 4ying s- United Party were flocking to Lt him. On the left there was t- I be a small Progressive type d opposition; on the right there was emerging a deeply conserva- tive group of old style Nation- alists who were breaking from the \" revolutidnary\" Nation- alist Party and going back to a the virtues of Saasskap and a a simple white supremacy. e To-morrow's caucus meeting puts the question mark againIs d this trend. Schoematl could e probably take Verwoerd's place as the leader of the centre. Sena. d tor de Klerk or Doctor Donges i. could also do so. Vorster ?-of P all the Nationalist Ministers he . is the most feared by the English sector of the population; he has t never hidden his hatred of Britain. Here again, the country , . will suffer from the typical o failure of enlightened despots to choose their heir in time. d Throughout this past week the r. grief and distress have been In, n spired not by the shocking nature Ji Continued on Post 13",

   "text_content" : "Sir.-A point contipually over. looked in discussions on Inflation is that wage increases which lead to price increases art not inflation. ary In the strict sense of the word. Inflation always causes a rise in prices, but not all rises in prices are caused iy inflation. The phe. Comenon o too much money chasint a ljmid amount of goods, can b eaused only by increasing the money euply. The Pirects Of ths and there r many. are then con dly ldlts 4 different kindsof ifliio hat is cost p4Â»h In4at9\",1 demand pull inflation,\" \" price inflation,\" etc. In the normal course of events, when groups of workers receive increased wages, these are inevit- ably passed on in higher prices. The result is that purchasing power is transferred from the consumer to the lucky group who have received the wage increase. Inflation is not involved. There has been merely a transfer of purchasing power, the cost of living going up for some and downs for others. It has been said that most wage increases have been cancelled out by inflation. rather is it that infla. tion has preceded and cancelled out wage increases. It is my belief that the increase in the money supply has been the pacemaker with wage demands striving to keep up with it. Stability Can be reached only when we have a sound currency and when the money supply remains more or less constant. The benefit of increased productivity would then filter through to the consumer in lower prices, not 19 hbgher wages. While we persist with our Inflation ary policies we will never get rid of the \" stop-go.\" V. H. BWONDt,. 74. Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill. N.10.",

   "text_content" : "Sir,-.The article by Samuel Brittan, \"Do we want more pro- ductivlty?\" (August 31) well describes the confusion which now surrounds this subject. Many People were looking forward to the National Productivity Conference thls month for a long-awaited call to action. However It now seem that the conference will merely dis. cuss three comparatively second afy papers, with perhaps aoth conference in a year's time. This is a most disappointin anti climaxe. No wonder the TUC is sceptical about the value of this project. Surely, in the face of our seriou :conomlo plight, we cannot So on in this leisurely fashion. The pre- sent standstill may be our last chance to take purposeful action to right our affairs. Both Lord Shaw- cross and Sir Maurice Laing have said recently that if we do not quickly solve our manpower utilisa- tion problem we face national disaster. The facts have been pro- vided by William J. Allen (Sunday Times, June 12) who showed that our industries were seriously over- manned by international standards. Professor Baumol (THE FINANCIAL TIMES, August 4) said that in Britain \"only the most vague and general exhortations are substituted for concrete proposals in the area of productivity.\" We cannot and must not ignore these and other informed opinions about our national weaknesses. There is still, at this eleventh hour, a widespread resistance in Britain to productivity techniques which our foreign rivals adopt as a matter of course. The key to efficiency is what it always has been: it is the tried and proved work study for. mula for making the most elctive use of our human and material re- sources and for uncovering proce- dural weaknesses wherever they occur. I suggest that the estab- lished management procedures and organisation details in question could be set down by a group of experenced consultants and pub- lished inside three months as an apthoritative Government guide to high productivity. Nothing like this h-s been tried before. It would undoubtedly go a long way towards helping to improve our industrial performance and from this lead to the permanent liquidation of our financial and economic diMculties. VicroR SMITH.

Any Institution which borrows short to lend so very long must be able to vary interest rates.

A chilling rebuff to hopes of Britain's being allowed to join the Common Market in the foreseeable future was delivered in Caen this week-end by a leading Gaullist Deputy, M.

Economic Troubles Secondly, M. Palewski suggested that Britain's economic difficulties, together with lack of agreement on internatioqal liquidity and balance of payments questions, also pre. clu her joing the Community, However, he did not spell out whether France merely wished the U.S. and U.K. to end their trade deficits or wanted the reserve currencies dethroned as well.

Following cancellation of the Man- taro contract in; Pern and the oil pipeline contract in Syria, a resolu- tion has been issued here by the Finance Ministry awarding the contract for the construction of a new. port at Pejerrey. near Pisco, to the Italian company, Impresit del Pacifico, and not to George Wimpey, of Britain. The final tender of the Italians was Soles 299.3nm. (about Â£4m.), whereas the Wimpey tender was Soles 306.05m. However, the Ten- der Board bad earlier recommen- ded that Wimpey be given the contract, on the ground that the Italian bid was .invalidated by a legal technicality. The resolution states that this has: now been rectified, and .the award is being made with the ap- proval of the World Bank, which is lending $9.1m. (Â£3.25m.) for the project.

   "text_content" : "FOR A SECTION of the com* munity who vehemently adopt the attitude that they want Snothin from the law but to be left alone. ;he trade unions have hardly been practising what they preach The Vaca tion Court bo heen dominated this year by issues of trade unlonism-not all. it is true, of the unions' making. The decision of Mr. Justice Goff in McNamee v. Cooper and others was a cliffbanger affair with the parties In the Royal Courts of Justice and the delegates at' the TUC confer- ence at Blackpool watching the clock. In the end this breath- taking race to affect the voting at Blackpool on the Govern- ment's wage freeze policy was irrelevant, the judge declining to grant. an injunctipo against the officials of the National Union of General and Munici- pal Workers voting in support of the wage freeze. Rarely, however, has a High Court judge been' so close to influencing a decision of high political iportance. Even if the immediate impact of the court ruling was, in the result, nil, there are some lasting lessons to be learnt for the unions. There are two aspects to the case-one concerning the scope of the union roules con- trolling the powers of union officials, and the second con- cerning the general law check- ing acts of maladministration and misgovernment by union officials. Support, But... In May 1966 the NUGMW at its 51st Annual Congress at Torquay passed a composite motion supporting the Govern- nient's policy on prices and incomes but declaring that the Congress would not tolerate. any- standstill of the rates of pay of the lower paid indus- tries and services, and \"would take all necessary steps to secure. for them adequate in- creases in wages.\" This was a resolution in defiance of the By JUSTINIAN Government's call for. an un- qualified wages freeze. If the Union on a card vote at the TUC Conference were to act in conformity with the resolu- tion of all its members the TUC's support of the Govern- ment would very likely have foundered on the- rocks at- Blackpool. - The National Executive Com- mittee of the union met early last month and resolved to sup- port the General Council of the' TUC. At a meeting later in the month of the NUGMW's General Council Mr. McNamee., a member of the General Coun- oil, had complained that the declared policy of thk Executive' Committee flouted the comp- site motion of the union in Congress. Mr.\" McNamee's amending resolution was de- seated in the general council which in effect accepted a wages standstill-a volte face in the union's policy. Mr,.McNamee took his opposition to the courts, asking for an injunction against the union officials to restrain them from casting the union's card vote' on, the TUC General Council's motion. The question was primarily a construction of the .union rules. Did the rules effectively provide that the union officials, who had the day to day management of union affairs, were bound in carrying out their functions to comply with congress decisions? Any draftsman of union rules would be unlikely to fetter union officials in such a way, for to accord no recognition to the change of circumstances and events between Annual Congresses would be to curb unnecessarily the activities of elected officers. On the other hand if the membership of a voluntary association wished to retain the maximum say in union affairs in the hands of, the members collectively there is nothing to stop theni framing theit rules accordingly. In the event the judge held that the rules of the NUGMW had precisely, that effect, and the reversal of the union policy by the executive committee was in breach of the rules as a defiance-of the decision of the May Congress. This decision came as a surprise to the union officials who recalled that the current rules had been drafted by Sir Stafford Cripps with the expressed design of giving the maximum freedom of action to the union's officers in the con- duct of union affairs. Injunction ? If the union's rules had been broken, why then did the court not grant the one and only effective remedy, namely, an in- junction to restrain action which would be unlawful? Once the union officials had exercised their vote at Black. pool no other remedy the court might give would be of the slightest value. The judge's reasoning in decliding to grant an injunction is not altogether easy to follow. Since the General Council of the union was acting, the judge said, not outside the scope of its powers but only in breach of the rules this constituted a lesser wrong than if it had been exceeding its powers. -The union had power to vote as it wanted to at the TUC conference; what it was doing wrong was to exercise that power in a manner not authorised by the union membership in accordance with the rules. And since this was only a breach of rules there had been no interference with the .property rights'of any member of the union. The court's reliance upon property rights appears to over- look the real rights of union membership. There could hardly be any more important duty than that union officials should comply with the rules. If officials transgress the rules then the members' rights are to that extent infringed. It seems odd that the courts should coun- tenance transgressions by union officials to the extept of deny- ing the only effective remedy available.",

Meat Trade Suppliers Operating mainly as a supplier of sausage casings. Meat Trade Suppliers is constantly having to adjust its sights. The cyclical pattern of its trade has marked the last two years: 1964-65 with a bad frst half followed by a better second, and the latest results where the reverse applies. Unfor- tunately. the end result is just the same-profits down for the third year in succession from Â£239,000 to Â£210.000 before (ax. The ividend is maintained at 30 per cent. but there must be a question mark here. Ignoring waivers and taking in the Deferred shares which rank next year, earnings are only 20% per cent. The chairman once said that the sausage trade improves as the economy runs down; the current year should provide every chance to justify that remark and it peeds to be justified-even with the shares on a 12.7 per cent. vield at 12s 3d. Benjamin Priest With the motor industry as its main customer. Benjamin Priest and Sons (Holdings) is rot optimistic about prospects in the current year; it is expected to be \"most difficult\" to retain profits at their present level-Â£212,000 before tat against Â£166.000 pre- viously. In fact it seems almost cer- tain that Priest, which operates as .presswork and welded fabricators, and nut and bolt manufacturers, will see a decline. But this need not cause too much worry since the group is in a reasonably strong position. Cover for the lfective 13.3 per cent. dividend-but for the freeze a 14% per cent. payment would have been forthcoming-is over 2.8 times. And the cash position is healthy with no bank indebtedness and net cash flow running at Â£137.000 against outstanding cap - tal commitments of Â£34W00 on March 31 last: Perhaps even more i important the group is now in a position to take full advtange of any upturn in the motor industry. The new factory at Rhayader is I \"rogressing well and-is expected to help ease the labour -shortages in I the Midland area, while. improved I methods and efficiency have already kept -margins under con- trol. So it looks as if the group can ride over a temporary setback. At I s 6d the Ss Ordinary shares yield 5.5 per cent.; the PIE ratio is only 6.3:1. George Oliver With increased turnover and tenfdits still coming through from past modernisation, George Oliver (Footwear) has again managed a rise in profits. Before tax profits are Â£82,000 against Â£74000--after unstated stock adjustments. As a retailer of footwear' and hosiery the second half of thq year is tradi- tionally much the more favourable, but the summer has not been good to the shoe trade. Manufacturers' deliveries were 8 per cent. up in the first quarter but 1 per cent. less in the second. This hides, however, a 7 per cent. decline in June so if this trend continues it looks -as though Oliver might have problems. Assuming Â£155.000 for the second six months (the same rate as in 1965) profits would emerge at Â£L37.000 leaving earnings -taking the same proportion of tax as charged at the interim stage --still providing cover of 2.1 times or .a maintained 13%A per cent. dividend. Along with ample cash resources the 8 per cent. yield at 8s and PIE ratio of 6:1 take good care of the uncertaintied.",

Instalment credit sales through furniture shops, taking 1961 as 100. stood in July at 99, compared with 110 in July, 1965. \" This is further evidence, if any were needed,\" states the council, \" of just how sensitive credit sales of furniture are to restrictive measures,\" Since the first bout of restrictions last February, credit sales have been on average some 10 per cent, below 1965. After allowing for price changes, \"it is clear that the true picture is even worse.\" * August's figure will show how effective the second bout of restric. tions have been, \" but it is reason- able to predict a fall of at least 15 per cent. compared with last year, and probably nearer to 20 per cent.\" The most up-to-date council forecasts suggest that new orders for the current third quarter of 1966 should be worth about Â£40m. or 2 per cent below the third quarter last year, while deliveries could be maintained between Â£35m.-Â£40m."

The two comp w collaborate closely in future in research and development with particular emphasis on colour television and the use of micro-electrical techniques. Although the agreement is not a financial one, it does give CSF the chance of placing an increasing number of its components in Grundig machines in the future, thus securing an important new outlet at a time when the industry is becoming more and more integrated. Conversely Orundig will be able to profit from a regular supply of electrical parts and expertise from a firm which is not in competition with it in the retail Although Germany and France intend to use different colour tele- vision systems, about 90 per cent. of the parts in the two receivers would in practice be interchangeable. The first French-built colour sets are now expected to come on to the market here in October or November next year priced at around Frs.3.500 (Â£250) or twice as much as a regular bleckand-white model. The initial 5.000, or so sets will be fitted with U.S. cathode-ray tubesr since the French'version is unlikely to beieady for commercial use for a further six or 12 months.",

It means the loss of 400 tons of fuel, equivalent to 30 loads in a Hercules transport.

   "text_content" : "Oy A \" aN l Conmupondment Ti Br.tlb CongpM or Cdrime bt wee- might judtiiab*l Shve been given a mt by the comaercIal toonm aty as ajambboe for the crhulaologist sdthe t ringe dlpliaes ho daly deal with and treat the delnqueatso o our oodety. Yet isasi hursday there was a real nugget for those who sought a new perspective into commercial morality in the use of the conomrat - -trutur I-a. the corporate structure. Mre Morris Finer, QC, not only gave a select audience a peep into company fraud-how it is practised = cowpany drsectors and ow ft is ey sanctioned by the law of the land-but also revealed a whole new perspective of the func- tion of regulatory controls over the limited liability company. Successive company law com- i mittees and the ensuing legislation have given the country a century of sporadic and ill-planned endeavour to mitigate the more in- tolerable consequences of the application of a basic premise- tht business, even when conducted under the privilege of limited liability, is a affair between con- senting male adults in private. Laissez-faire The legal system, in its attitude to company fraud, has made no fundamental departure from the philosophy of the first Companies Act in 1856. Despite all the poten- tialities for chicanery, the doctrine of laissez-faire-which Mr. Finer translated as \"the liberty to be done\" - remains embedded in those very areas of the law which aim at regulating the conduct of companies and their directors. A fresh approach to the whole Â· problem of the limited liability corporate structure is called for. Limited liability is an artifice \"sanctioned by the community, derived as a privilege from Parlia- ment, and subject accordingly to the paramount rule of community, welfare.\" The conscious and; articulated philosophy behind the creation of limited liability com- panies however still thrives in a .welfare state where public account- ability is generally accepted, but the welfare principle has found ommerciai moralIty ln te use or section has no applicatipn at all where the loan, Inatad of W\" Uade to a director, s made to another cmpany controlled by the director of the lend. ing company. Another example from the 1948 Act is Section 54. This provides that it is unlawful for a company to assist financially in the purchase of its own shares. Breach of this section can involve a transaction amounting to six, or meven seven, figures, for which the maximum penalty is a fne of Â£100 and no possibility of imprisonment. Another relevant characteristic of the company law was its reluctance to fix directors with other than the very minimal standards of personal com- petence and behaviour. A dirqctor is, according to high judicial authority, nct bound to bring any special quali- firarions to the office. The law, in effect, treats indolence and incompe- tence as natural risks to which the shareholder exposes himself. Ille continued inability of dissen- tient minorities among shareholders to unseat the government (the Board of Directors) Is another feature of judi- cial inactivity. The tendency of the courts is to regard any opposition by, shareholders as a disloyal one, as troublemakers against the establish- ment. The initial bias against dissentient minorities is a response4to the fear that a sympathetic attitude will lead the court into the, abyss of adjudicat- ing on matters of eommercial policy; it is easier for judses to count heads than to evaluate the opinions of those heads. The Auditor A final characteristic of the laissez- faire. attitude of the law is the apparatus of controls set up to en- courage probity in the administration of company aRairs. The liquidator, paid by results by a percentage com- mission calculated on the assets he gamer in and the dividends distri- buted,. has primarily to satisfy the insolvent company's creditors. He is there to produce cash, not convic- tionris; there is no dividend for put- ting deliquent directors behind bars. And qually, the auditor is not regarded 4g law as a sleuth. The courts have said he is a watchdog and not a bbloodhound. Many of the less reputable and incompetent accountnts when exposed to dis- reputable directors, may ease their consceces r their workloads with the teflectiot that, after all, a spaniel if a sortoF watchdog too.",

By Our Industrial Reporter Retail traders, particularly in the food sector, are being swamped by a wave of special sales promotions by manufacturers of branded goods. Over 750 suppliers are mounting new schemes involving free gifts, competitions, and premium offers over the next few mmath. The greater scale of the promotional battle in petrol retailing has spurred food and other manufacturers to launch bigger and better sales-boosting schemes for their products. Consumer interest is apparently stronger than ever. maraeunp airectors nave aevisea an astonishingly varied number of national promotions, and the need to combat the impact of rival schemes has- even led to the use of critical path analysis techniques for assessing whether successful sales results are assured. Campbells Soups In the fact, the weight of pro- motions in the final quarter of this year will be such that at least one major advertiser, Campbells Soups, has pulled out and devised plans for \"made to measure\" promo- tions run in conjunction with retailers' own trading ideas. Some idea of the overall scale and diversity of the promotions about to be' ntroduced or ust started, can be gained from the following examples. Crosse and Blackwel plans its largest ever TV' campagn for a group product shortly, and this will be tied to the offer o vouchers of the \"buy. bo is ntho y begits distri buting l2,Sax vouchers entitli housewives to set 3d off its eaooratI d -----------walo if milk.

   "text_content" : "Sir,.-Mr Myer* plea (Sep- tember 5) for an \"overhaul of Government statistical services \" was based oat-h alueed In- ,-adequaoy ofp! A ie on life assiuance. W ay I uggeot thata stropng ase can be .ade for a thorough review of thee services in general? In the field that has concerned me person- ally for-aanumbesoof year*-that * is, earninas and. hourn o% work -sot only is. much of'the apub- lished data inadequate and too out-of-date to be of practical value. some is of such low value to industry that one must ques- tion whether there is any point in continuing to collect- and publish it- Overaiet Depart- * ments may fear that ai y review would lead toq an explason of statistical servIce; ut In. my view the need'a for a ieduction in the amount of data being collected and/or published. Three &Eapl m Three examples are: (w) Occupational Earnings in oglin- eering (January- and June). Thetables, published in the Gazette givei' averages for the main categories (skilled, semi-, skilled and labourers) by indus- try section and by region and a detailed breakdown into \"classes\" (that is, trades) by industry section and region. It is with particular reference to the breakdown into trades that my criticism is concerned. The tables give average weekly and hourly earnings, both including and excluding overtime pre- miums. The return form states that \"shift allowances, etc.\" should be included in \"total earnings\" and that these allow- ances should not be included in \" overtime premiums.\" The use- fulness of any comparison be- tween my company s averages Sand those published by the Ministry, therefore, depends upon whether our proportions of shift and day workers (night- shifts too would affect the com- parison) are similar to those in the companies covered by the. returns: Since we do not know the latter, any comparison is meaningless. This is by no means .an insignificant point. Shift working does not merely affect the weekly earnings by the addition of shift allowances, but even more markedly affects the hourly earnings because in most cases fewer hours are worked In the week. The published information is therefore positively misleading and the work involved a waste - of time. Much more meaning- ful data can be, and often is collected locally by personnel officers and others cohncenhed. (2) Average Weekly Earnings by Region and by Industrial Classification (April and Octo ber). My qxperience here Is that the national and regional averages for particular sections of the engineering Industry are not infrequently very eriousl affected by a change il the coverage from one survey to the next. Since the Ministry seem unable to guarantee that the coverage is consistant, what is the point of publishing such mis! leadng information? The only' useful comparison in practice seems to be with the whole of the engineering industry. (3) Index of Average Earn. ings (Monthly Returns). The Services Coverd\" 'must surely have- received enough attention for there to'be no doiblt ai to their lack of value for lndustry, I can well understand that the index for all, eployees in \"All Industries and Srvic* \"i of value for' natosal. hibacme monitoring purposes, but 4do Sthe indices for separat. in. dustry grou' add, anytiis gcqf value for this -eurpose, flrctuations in these indices are even wider than i, the overall indices and I can see no vialue whatever in publishing them. Misleading A further criticism is that the publication of separate ip dices for employees paid weekly and paid moAty ca lead to misleadiC= concluaida. Transfer of ivi vdua from : the weekly pald to the monthly paid group, it usually asso ted with an increase of responsi- bility and of salary. Thepeople transferred tend therefore-to be in the higher income bracket' of the weekly paid but move into the lower income bracket of the monthly paid.' Ii con- sequence it is possible for the' rise in the separate Indicis to be lower than that for the two groups combined, and indeed this is invariably the case with, indices for staff in my company. Many companies are now! itaking determined efforts to raise the level of effectiveness' in non-manufacturing -depart-s ments and indeed are question- ing whether some of the work- can be dispensed with. At' the same time they are being expected to cope with an in- creasing load of work arising from recent legislation. Could not a joint working party of - representatives from the CBI, the TUC and Government Departments be 'set' up-to' review the statistical services' G. J. MEPHAs. - 29, Firviewi Kbad. Sutton. I Cost of the GI'o a18 Sir,-The Director of Publio\" ns Relations at the OPO (Septe*a \" 9 ber 6) In a reply to my letter 'j of August 11 concerning thb he national Giro brochure states be that \"the Postmaster General In explained in the House of Corn* be mons the total cost of the ;sl brochure was Â£28,000.\" is* In that case the distribution 1y of the brochure must have been Ce very limited, and many of your of readers will not have received it. The brochure is double n- backed (stretching 30 inches he when open) in a stiff glossy he paper and encloses 23 sheets ad (size h inches by 11% inches), 4ly And one sheet (folded into three )n -size 24 inches by 11 % inches). to The print is in three colours, y, red, blue and black. There is he also enclosed separately, a per* LIt sonal letter from the Director, of The weight is about 9 ozs and ne the printed paper postage would to be 7d. It is possible that the in* production was around 150,000 of copies. I mentioned in my pre* be vious letter that one firm re- re ceived three copies, another firm i1 (with four subsidiaries) received oe 'ten (five separate copies one week, another five a week later). Accepting Mr. O'Brien's figure of Â£28,000 as the cost, at this must be in the nature of a trial effort. Neither he nor the jd PMG can seriously imagine that the promotion cost of a new . dea such as the national Giro will.not, exceed l1m. As a re- ly ilt of the GPO brochure the id central banks are now reported d. to be reconsidering their own Ie giro scheme, which has been in e 'cold storage for some years. If et someone; does not intervene e soon, the taxpayer may have to et foot one side of the expense of 4. A ostly battle for customers to betwed the Post Office and the to banks. ro ' At a time when strict 4d economy should be the watch- th word, for the Government as ly well as the taxpayer, I repeat that a better use for the money w i can be found at the present than to Jaunchong a national giro. s ' G.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN AT GOODWOOD on July 27 Full Stretch, a bay filly by Sing Sing, was the medium of a whole- hearted gamble in the Selsey Stakes for two-year-olds. Unfortunately for her supporters she caught a- tartar in Darya, who flew out of the gate and was virtually home and dried before most of the other runners had settled into their stride. However, on her next appearance, at Lingleld on August- 19, Full Stretch made no mistake, and, with Piggott in the saddle, she Is un- likely to be beaten in the Bexley Stakes (3.0) at Goodwood this afternoon. Another sound bet on this aftert noon's Goodwood card is Anippe in the Plantation Stakes (4.0). The ground may be firmer than AnIppe likes it, but Judged on her running in the Oaltres Stakes at York, where she flnished third, beaten by a length and the same by Crift1. and Corbalton at level weights, bhe ought to have the measure of the opposition here. In the Valdoe Handicap (3.30) I1 suggest Antiquarian, the dual Great \"Jubilee \" Handicap winner. At Wolverhampton, I like the look. of Dunmore Lass II in the Midland Cambridgeshire (3.0). This American-bred Ally has run consistently well throughout the season, and her last effort, when runner*up to Marandis for the valuable Ripon Rowels Handicap a fortnight ago, suggests that she has a great chance here with 7st 13 Ibs. Hully Oully is not harshly treated in the Staffordshire Nur. sery Handicap (4.0), and Tabasco isle, who will be running over a suitable distance for the first time, is another who could o close. But it might be worth taking a chance with Shoe Cream, a colt by St. Creapin 11I, who showed promise once or twice, in goodales cown rmny early ia the sumnlr, aid who is costainly brd to stay a mile.",

There is an understandable need to utilise as much of the high-space as possible for office develop- ments. These bring in much needed te1veue by offerng welcomn office acco \"iodation over main line stations which are almost invariably in the centre of a business area. A number have in fact been com- pleted and those which have ,beaten the recent cut-back in :,office building- are already on the way. A Y*ity.?tevay But why, with such an opportunity, were these, modem city 'gateways not given the prestige treatment that they needed? One would have thought that, just as commer- clat and trade organisations need- impressive headquarters, trade as a whole needs an impressive national introduction to its locale. Of all such places the terminal id re and principal stations in great to cities are the most 'important. ,e Leeds as a city is becoming P- transformed; without, much Ch apparent planning coherence, it g is true but, largely due to the ch central developments of the he university, with ,considerable A vigour. The City Station is, n- therefore,, of the greatest ve importance to the city's prestige. in It will eventully include the ,n functions of the nearby Central as a passenger station and will then handle all the passenger traffic.-. ' The City Station- has How n been given the usual treatment n and, as obviously dictated from ie the top, this treatment is surely Iy not good enough. When con- Pe sidering the great curving plat- r- form roofs of York with their is height, spaciousness and dignity, s, it is clear enough, although n regrettably so, that British RaIl- i ways cannot afford anything so splendidly monumental; other Il occupiers must be brought in to t help with revenue and the old picturesque panache of a major [ St. Pancras or a minor Shrews- I bury cannot be repeated. t In these days of ceiling costs i and site restrictions, architects ! cannot even design with any real or reasonable freedom; particu- larly in circumstances such as those in Leeds. There are, how- ever, good reasons for question- ing the restrictions under which they work. In the first place, if valuable high-spaca .s-o6ble.leased to a developer, why cannot one co- ordinating design dictate the general architectural conception of'the development, or as in the case of many public authorities, why cannot British Railways insist on designing the whole so that some cohesion results. At Leeds, the office development is architecturally lamentable and completely out of key with the tidy steel-framed minor office block and signal room which British Railways architects have designed above the passenger conbourse. Engineer's Roof Even so, this is a rather feqble tucked-away crown to the con- stricted street frontage below and in front of it, but apart from this the architects have not even been allowed to roof the plat. form complex. The positioning of platforms is clearly a matter for railway engineers, the roofs represent structural problems which have also been handled by engineers who, quite pro. perly, design the structural wl aspects. But this should be done th in a consultant capacity with the architect as dsilgner of the th, overall form and appearance, The result in this case is a th gloomy tunnel with the light ro shut out at each end where the ap all-too*low roof drops its deep thi gable over the track. The roof ad sits like a black hat over the ro eyes with the bright light of day mak ng an almost unbearable pa dauul where It penetrates under an the brim, at the very point tbi The mats i6uimmus ihAIu iil'w aul Rim\". sad ido s",

   "text_content" : "by OHNjAkRWE The only certain thiap abou form of the boys at Jun orw oa don last week was its ua r9t1lflipsi and the final in which the I8y llf- old holder and overwhehlift isf favourite, David Lloyd (Essesx), lq th 4-6, 4-6 to schoolboy nigbyMW, th4 national John Williams, oNs 01d :9* end, a year his junior, illustratid vt the point clearly. Lloyd was ill at-,. ease from the start and never coal -I4; pletely shrugged off an air of - apparent indifference which the thl tension of the occasion produced tal Williams, therefore, was able to Jul deploy his talents of accuracy and Cc steadiness to full effect and took Pl the first three games largely through il his opponent's errors. When Lloyd won the next four games to lead 4.3 with his service W to follow it seemed as if he might relax sufficiently to produce the winners, but two double-faults left t no doubt that the tension remained The second set was almost a repetition of the first, with Lloyd , continuing his halfhearted attacks to the moment where he held a a point for 5-3 . on his service tt Another fluffed forehand volley f lost him the point, and the end soon t came. Williams deserves full credit 0 for taking his chance without t wavering. He has a fine build, as befits a rugby player, and will no P doubt add aggression to solidity to 5 make further advances in the game, though his intention to fol- t low a medical career may limit his s opportunities. tl Earlier uncertainties saw the c downfall of five of the seeded boys n before the quarter-final stage on Thursday. Apart from the finalists, the only survivor was Simon Part- ridge (Leicester), who is almost 18 and has the big shots plus the deter- mination to take him ahead. Of the others I liked the look of David Roberts (Warwickshire), who at 16 i has two more Junior Champion- ( ships ahead of him, and Stuart i Creed (Somerset), who hits with f two hands on both wings and is the t same age. Both of these boys lack 1 physical strength and they would I be well advised to devote part of , their winter to serious training to aid natural growth. Also the doubles skill of John Paish (Surrey) bore witness to the value of heredity, for his father, ex-Davis Cup player Geoffrey, always ex- celled in this department of the game. The girls were more predictable than the boys and there were only two casualties at the last-eight stage. The Scots girl Marjorie Love, aged 17, was beaten by Jill Cooper (Surrey), also 17, and last year's heroine, Veronica Burton (Middlesex), now 14, fell in three sets to the improved Sue Morgan (Kent), two years her senior, who went on to beat the fourth seed, Diane Bridger (Devon), in three sets. The title was retained by Judy Congdon (Devon) without much difficulty 6-4, 6-3, against the chal- lenge of the second-youngest of the seeded players, Diane Oakley (Essex), who is nearly 15 and another product of high pedigree, for her father Gerald was also a Davis Cup player. Miss Oakley's hour of glory had come in the semi- final when she survived Friday's heat to win a two-hour match against the No. 2 seed, Corinne Molesworth (Devon), 6-4, 7-9, 6-4. Miss Congdon is clearly better than any of her contemporaries, though I am not sure that her qualities of cunning and variety are those which will succeed in the senior game.

What one always hopes to see is a large number of really promising players all competing with one another for the future honours of the game, for this is how standards rise In this respect. Britain falls far short of America and Australia, where there are literally dozens of young players who would be capable of reaching the latter stages of last week's event at Wimbledon. This is the price we pay for regarding tennis as a secondary sport at school and at national level. Until this situation changes, we must be content to make the best of the material that is available.",

   "text_content" : "by DAVID ROBINSON The jury at this year's Venice Film Festival, with the Italian writer Giorgio Bassani as presi- dent, had a* somewhat literary character. (The British representa- tive, Lindsay Anderson, and the German, Erwin Leiser, were the only working film makers among them unless you count the great Soviet pioneer Lov Kulesov, who has not made a film for a quarter of a century.) This alone, however, could hardly account for the whim. sical awarding of the prizes, which drew vociferous disapproval from the audience on Saturday evening. Gillo Pontecorvo's La Batagila di Atleri, which took the major prize is, as 1 reported last week, an admirable film. Most people in Venice agreed, however, that both Robert Bresson's Au Hasard, Balthiasar and Francois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 were a good deal better. The Truffaut was ignored; the other was handed a consolation prize in the form of an \" Omaggio a Bresson.\" The French delegation boycotted the award ceremony in protest against the award to a Left-wing, pro-Algerian film. It is difficult, too, to understand how the jury came to award the Volpi Cup for the best actor to Jacques Perrin for Un Jomo a Meta and La Busca. As far as one could see the performances were able; but only so far, for in each case other actors have dubbed the speech. This award was at least better received by the audience than the prize awarded to the Soviet actress Natalia Atinbas- carova which displeased both the faction which favoured Julie Christie (Fahrenheit 451) and the other which, with more reason, felt the award should go to Alexandra Kluge for her playing in her brother's film .Abscheid von Gestern. This interesting German film at least received a special jury prize. An equivalent prize was awarded to Conrad Rooks' Chappaqua, though Mr. Rooks slightly retrieved his situation with a pathetic little speech on the tragedies of drug addiction. which turned aside the angry hisses and catcalls with which the first announcement of his prize was met. Starting with bans and ending with boos; and with the Catholic Patriarch of Venice thundering against the moral poverty of the entries here, this has not been a happy festival.",

Well the lawsuits have not yet been resolved. And even that by the New York Stock Exchange authorities against the Board of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company is now the subject of an appeal. But development of potential zinc-copper-silver mine, the dis- covery of which caused such a furore way back in 1964, is forging ahead with scant attention being paid on the site to the legal battles a friend just returned from this Canadian mining town tells me. Spasmodic strikes among the con- tractor firms are much more of a worry, he says. Even these are not expected to stop the big 9,000 tons a day con- * centration plant from starting up in the final quarter of this year. i As announced in June, one of i Canada's leading mining com- panies, Noranda, will smelt the concentrates and produce anode - copper which will then be refined, f also by Noranda. The zinc con- centrates will be sold as such pending completion of Texas i Gulfs own smelter. 1 Even without this the cost of the I project is put at around Â£20m. STexas Gulf no par value shares v have tumbled from their $130 peak n of earlier this year to $77% in n New York in line with the general is setback in that market and the c lessening of publicity about the r, ,e world sulphur shortage.

   "text_content" : "By Our Insurance Correspondent Even before the rapid sell-out ir of the recent limited issue of a World Cup Winners stamps, specu- V. lative interest in special issues had si been high, provoked in part by p the changed attitude of the Post st Office in the last four years to ci such issues. e' Special issues apart. there seems ti to be an upsurge of interest in 5 stamps, either as speculative invest- ments unlikely to attract capital tl gains tax or for private collections, p and a growing number of people are likely to have varying quanti- F ties of stamps, mint or used, British sa or foreign. in their home. F Cover is provided for stamps c under the home policies which e most of us have on the contents of our houses, but this cover is of limited financial extent. Limited cover a Usually contents are defined as, including \"Household goods and personaf effects of every descrip- r tion - including cash. currency, notes, bank notes and stamps not I forming part of a stamp collection I to an amount not exceeding Â£50 I or 5 per cent. of the full value I of the contents whichever Is the I less. . . .\" Though It might be thought that stamp collections are thereby ex* I eluded, stamp collections are I personal effects and subsequently the policy states Inter alla that \" no I one stamp collection shall be deemed to be of greater value than 5 per cent, of the full value of the ' contents unless speolally declared In a separate Item. Thus both the speculative Investor in new issues and the collector are advised to tell their Insurers of the value of their stamps-leaving a suitable margin for subsequent purchases during the year of in. surance Otherwise they may be considerably out of pocket, in the event of loss, victims not only of fire or burglary, but also of the 5 per cent. rules. Financial limits apart, though they do cover a wide range of perils, home policies do not give protection against all misfortunes: loss or damage must occur in con- sequence of one of the stated perils. For example, simple loss is not covered, while larceny of stamps is expressly excluded. Stamp policy Much wider cover can be obtained by the purchase of an \"All Risks\" policy. The name \"All Risks\" is something of a misnomer, for such a policy inevit- ably has exclusions. One company has long specialised in the issue of a stamp collector's \" All Risks\" policy, and the cover and terms available in the rest of the market reflect this company's practice. Cover is given in the collector's home, while in transit In his per- sonal custody (subject to the exclu- sion of theft from unattended vehicles) and at exhibitions within the U.K. Despatches by post, rail or other carrier are also covered, usually subject to a limit of Â£1,000 or the sum insured, whichever is the less. on any one packet. Such packets If over Â£10 In value must be registered or sent at carriers' risk. Often a limit on any one stamp is imposed of 2'/ per cent. of the total sum insured, for stamps other than those for which values 4 have been specifically declared. Premium rates For a long while the standard rate has been Ss per cent. charged on the total market value of the collection and the collector's phila* telic material. Special terms will be required from the collector who wants high postal/delivery limits, or exhibits his collections fre- quently. Moreover with present crime losses, higher rates may he required from the holders of sub-* stantial or valuable collections or collectors living in urban areas. It is a sign of the times that insurers may now require the installation and use of safes to their specifica. tion as a condition of giving cover.",
