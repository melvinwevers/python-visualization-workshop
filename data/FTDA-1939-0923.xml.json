FRIDAY Evening. The main feature of interest in Money market circles to-day was the result of the Treasury bill tender. As the bills available included the popu- lar end-year maturity some recession in the rate was expected. One or two changes were made in the official exchange rates, while there was a sharp improvement in forward silver. Applications for the Â£55,000,000 of Treasury bills on offer amounted to Â£86,500,000, as compared with Â£89,165,000 the previous week. The market concen- trated mainly on the Monday and Satur day bills, the former being only an 89 day maturity and the latter a very end year bill. All the bills were allotted at an average rate of discount of Â£3 6s 1.25d as compared with Â£3 lls 1.12d per cent. a week ago. Tenders will be invited next Friday for Treasury bills to be allotted to the maximum amount of Â£55,000,000. Despite the fall in the tender rate, leading houses made little or no alteration to their buying rates for short-dated paper, still calling the three months bank draft 3% per cent. The clearing banks were ready to take mixed parcels of November and December dates at 3% per cent., while there was a keen demand for \" hot\" Treasury bills at 3 per cent. Short loan conditions continued very comfort- able and money could be obtained in out- side quarters at 2% per cent. In most cases, charges for renewals have been re- duced to 2% per cent.

In the silver market, the feature was a speculative demand for forward silver and with only small amounts offering the price rose %.d to 23%d per ounce, thus bringing it up to the spot quotation, which was unchanged on the day. Guilders Firmer A fair amount of activity was reported in the foreign exchanges, but only one or two of the official quotations were altered. Dutch guilders hardened to 7.50, but Belgian belgas were weaker at 23.50. The U.S. dollar was quoted at $4.03 middle. In the \" free\" market, Danish kroner hardened to 21%, Finnish marks to 202%, Portuguese escudos to 110 and Peruvian soles to 20, but Italian lire weakened further to 77 and Brazil milreis cheapened to 3'd.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 22nd Sept. The undertone of the Stock Market was nervous, as although President Roose- velt's Message to Congress yesterday was well received, traders realised that the threatened Congressional battle over re- peal of the arms export embargo will have at least temporary repercussions on the market. The final list was mostly fractions to $1 down in an easy close. Turnover was further reduced to 1,660,000 shares from 1,730,000 yesterday. The opening was strong, but traders during the morning were cautious and profit-taking reduced the initial advances by fractions to $1. At midday the market was narrow and undecided, with minor gains predominating. In the early afternoon prices moved narrowly in both directions. War stocks were quiet. Motors were hesitant, despite to-day's statement by Ward's that there had been widespread indications of a favourable reception of new models. Although some buying of Utilities for the long pull was reported, this group was re- stricted. Rails and Rail Equipments were firm. The market later sold off in moderately active trading. Bethlehem Steel, after falling 4 points from the day's high, ended 1% lower at 91%4. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average reacted 0.91 to 152.57, but Rails gained 0.23 at 33.06 and Utilities 0.05 at 24.70. Dealings comprised 893 stocks, of which 388 declined, 296 improved and 209 were unchanged. It is understood that some sold-out bulls have placed orders at levels not far below current quotations. Meanwhile, the domestic business horizon continues to brighten, and the Pittsburg index stands at the best since October, 1937. Steel scrap at Pittsburg is 50c dearer at $22- $22% per ton, the highest since April, 1937. In the Bond market, U.S. Governments continued to sag, despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to discourage selling, but Rail issues kept firm. Bond sales amounted to $16,620,000, against $15.470,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Dec., 1931=100) was 172.8, against 171.3 yesterday. Railroad freight loadings for the week to 16th September totalled 805,700 cars, an increase of 138,300 on the week and of 145,600 on a year ago to the highest for two years. Loans to brokers decreased $25,000,000 in the week to 20th September at $405,000,000. Other loans for purchasing or carrying securities were unchanged at $178,000,000. Caterpillar Tractor-July net income $394,461 ($158,473 year ago); 7 months $2,709,842 ($1,291,087). AVERAGES AND VOLUME C ,lC 1 iH m hia d Isdds l.

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange closed the obui- less week in curiously cheerful fashion. A good many, perhaps most, mem- bers came up yesterday morning with he idea that with the fixing of the Budget for next Wednesday nobody wvould care to do much during the inter val. As it turned out, there was quite a respectable number of buying orders, especially for leading Oils, Industrials :nd Yankees. Good Recoveries It is now generally recognised that th semi-forced liquidation in the first 'wo days of this week was permitted in many cases to exercise an exagge- rated effect on prices. For example, last Tuesday Imperial Tobacco marked down o 96s 3d, Distillers 80s and Guinnes: 74s. Since Tuesday Imps. have regained nore than half-a-sovereign, being bid for yesterday afternoon at 106s 3d. Guinness have had almost as big a re- covery, marking several times yester- day at 82s 6d. Distillers have rallied to 35s bid. Encouraging Factors Early in the week it was feared that the rate of 6 per cent. per annum for the compulsory war insurance of stocks and materials might prove a crushing burden on many companies. The partial relief already promised has to some extent assuaged anxiety. Then, too, it is felt that Sir John Simon will make every effort to spread the burden of new taxation as fairly as possible. If the nation's economic structure is to be kept in good trim and if the maximum of employment and taxable capacity is to be achieved, then industrial enterprises will have to be left with a reasonable propor- tion of their profits. Oriental Consols. Recommended here on 21st July at 30s the $10 shares of the Oriental Con solidated Mining Company are now changing hands at 47s 6d upwards. At a meeting in New York on 30th August the sale of the Korean gold concession to a Japanese group for U.S. $8,174,000 was formally accepted. This large sum is to be paid in three instalments-the last due by 31st August, 1943-with payment guaran teed by the Yokohama Specie Bank. The depreciation of sterling has in creased the value of the terms to British holders, in spite of the fact that they will have to hand over the dollar pay ments to the Bank of England in ex change for sterling. Sterling Value At the immediate pre-war rate of 4.68 the sale price equalled not much more than Â£4 per Oriental Consolidated share. At 4.04 it is now equal to Â£4 15s, plus certain cash balances representing over 10s per share, which should more than pay for the running of the offices until 1943. It is understood that the company received $5A per share on 31st August and is entitled to a further $14 by 30th November. Therefore 32s 6d of the present market price of 47s 6d may be regarded as covered by cash. The balance of 15s is an obviously inade- quate allowance for the further sums totalling over Â£3 per share due to be received by the company within less than four years. Uhe Jiarist",

   "text_content" : "The War Risli Rating Committee yes- terday amended the general schedule of rates (non-Government), in which the outstanding feature is that in American inter-coastal trade, cargo in United States ships is rated at one half the rate for cargo in other neutral vessels. In voyages between North and South America, cargo in U.S. ships is rated at 5s per cent., in neutral ships at 10s per cent. and in British or allied ships at Â£1. In the coastal, as distinct from inter- coastal trade on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, neutrals enjoy the 50 per cent. re- duction on the rate fixed for British ships with no discrimination in favour of the American flag. The Institute of London Underwriters has adopted a new British and Allies Cap- ture clause, which applies to insured cargo that is not, at any time during the voyage, the property of any Government or of any peison, firm or corporation (in- cluding those domiciled in neutral terri- tory), who are alien enemies of the United Kingdom or its allies. This new provision meets the case of a cargo, such as wheat for instance, that may change hands several times during a voyage. There is nothing in inter- national law to prevent a neutral selling the cargo to an enemy who may in turn sell it to another neutral. In such cases the enemy would have had, for the period of his ownership, the benefit of English insurance.",

   "text_content" : "FRIDAY Evening. The week's business ended in the Stock Exchange to-day with a more cheerful atmosphere than seemed likely a few days ago. Dealings remained difficult, but some sections, including Home Railways and Industrials, de- veloped a decidedly better price trend. Prospective settlement of tax un- certainties in Wednesday's War Budget was suggested as a reason for the harder general tone. The smoothness of yesterday's Settlement and Mr. Roosevelt's speech were contributory factors. The total of bargains marked was 2,197, against 2,233 yesterday. Conditions in the gilt-edged market showed little change, and turnover re mained severely restricted by the existence of minimum prices. A feature was again provided by small \"swaps\" from long dated stocks into 4% per cent. Conversion Loan, in which special bargains ranging up to 104 were recorded. Since the minimum price of this stock is 100%, buyers were obviously prepared to pay a considerable premium for the privilege of disposing of War Loan at the minimum of 88%. Canada 4 per cent. 1940-60, among Domi- nion stocks, changed hands from the fixed price of 98 up to 98%. South Africa 5 per cent. 1940-60 was bid for at % over the minimum of 97 and marked up to 97%. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 BELGIAN BONDS FALL Caution continues to be the keynote of the public attitude towards the Foreign bond market, and business remains at a very low level. After completion of the Settlement yesterday few fresh orders came to market, and although some prices were marked down a minimum of stock changed hands. Belgium's proximity to the theatre of war again caused some apprehension, and the 4 per cent. 1936 bonds were quoted 4% points lower at 57%. The position of Warsaw was also re- flected in a heavy marking down of Polish (1927) 4% per cent. from 28 to 20. Else- where Europeans showed few movements. The recent weakness of Far Eastern issues appeared to have abated for the most part, but the Tokyo 5% per cent. loan suffered a further fall of 2 points to 31 Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 L.M.S. 4% PREF. IMPROVE The return to strength of the Home Rail market continued, and although the turn- over remained small it showed further ex- pansion over that of yesterday. A feature of the day's trading was the fact that it was possible to sell one of the prior charge stocks slightly above the unofficial minimum. This was L.M.S. 4 per cent. Preference, which was finally quoted at 48%-50%, as compared with the minimum price qs 4,8. A rumour to the effect tha-tthe Govern ment may announce its terms for the compensation of the railways over the week-end assisted market sentiment. This, however, was not confirmed. Ordinary shares showed some more small advances. Great Western Ordinary put on a whole point to 24% and Brum were % to the good at 11%. Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary were also sup ported and added % to close at 50%. Foreign Rails passed a quiet day by contrast. Canadian Pacific, whose traffics continued to be good, were the object of some inquiry and were finally % better at 5%. Argentine Rails were neglected with the exception of B.A.G.S. for which a few buyers of Ordinary stock had to pay about % higher than last night's closing price. Final quotation was 9%. After losing a little ground yesterday, Antofagasta found a little more favour to-day and re- gained 1 point to 9. Elsewhere, Foreign Rails were unaltered. Following a firm lead from Wall Street American Rails were marked up at the outset this morning. During the day sufficient buying in this country to keep prices above parity made its appearance and purchases for shipment were small. New York Central closed 1% to the good at 25% and Illinois Central were 1% higher at 18%. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS HIGHER Further Improvement Among Popular Shares Moderate inquiry continued for Indus- trials and a satisfactory tone was maintained in this market. Further im- provement took place in several directions, particularly among Brewery and Tobacco descriptions. Iron and Steel and Motor shares experienced some recovery. While business was fairly well spread, sustained buying was restricted to specialities com- prising soma of the high-class Industrials. Realisations were relatively light and no selling pressure was encountered. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial inde:- was 85.4, against 84.8. Yesterday's moderate imptovement in the BANIING section made further pro- gress and Barclays \"A \" were % better at 8, with the \" B \" shares 2s higher at 56s. National Provincial \" B \" were 2s 6d up at 50s. Royal of Scotland stock fell 5 to 410. Hongkong and Shanghai were marked up 5 to 75. INSURANCE shares displayed no definite tendency. Pearl and North British issues were firmer. Prudential \" A \" tailed off X to 20 and Alliance (new) % to 18%. Fresh attempts were made to realise ELECTRIC POWER securities, and Yorkshire Electrics were down Is 9d to 28s 3d. Ed- mundsons and Midland Counties were 6d easier, but British Powers gained 6d to 23s 6d. Calcutta Electrics changed at 256. South Metropolitan Gas rose 1 to 73, but imperial Continental Gas fell 5 to 85. Some interest gwas evinced in ELECTRi- CAL EQUIvaMNTS and buying of G.E.C. up to 65s continued. English Electrics on the late fall attracted in a small way and rallied Is to 27s. Following yesterday's -.... -Â«, 14 t& Arl Pt'nmnian Partrinann\" were up Is to 14s 6d. Enfield Cable and British Insulated were lower. MOTORS were notable for a rebound of is 9d to 24s 3d in Morris, the setback having brought forward small buyers. Tillings found moderate support and rallied 9d to 32s 6d. Leylands and Asso- ciated Equipments gained %Â·. Rovers were sold and closed 2s 6d down at 11s 3d. While the business passing, was small, leading AIacRAFTr maintained their firm- ness, especially Hawker Siddeleys and Faireys. As an exception, Follands were lowered 9d to 3s 3d. In COMPONENTS, Dunlops were 9d lower at 23s 9d. Cessation of sales, combined with a little inquiry for shares, imparted a firmer tend- ency, to the STEEL and ARMAMENT group. Further interest was stimulated in United Steels by the interims on John Summers in which it has a holding; the former rose 7Yd further to 21s lYd. Baldwins were good with a gain of 7%d to 5s 3d and John Browns rallied 6d to 24s 3d. Vickers were 4%d better at 15s. In ENGINEERING, G. D. Peters changed at 18s and Metal Box at 74s 6d. Imperial Chemicals held their level, as did Murex. United Molasses firmed up to 25s. British Oil and Cake Preferred were 2s 6d down at 33s 9d. SHIPPING descriptions were better in places. Cairns recovered 9d to 5s 9d, while Clan Lines rose % to 6 and Furness Withy 6d to 21s. Inactive conditions persisted among TEX- TILES. Coats were steadier at 24s and Bradford Dyers Preference rose 4%d to 7s 6d. Patons and Baldwins gained Ve to 2%, at which they were rather buyers. RAYONS were quiet, with Courtaulds easier at 26s 3d. British Celanese Second Pre- ference gained 6d to 9s 9d and American Celanese % to 6%. Woolworths firmed up to 2% and Marks and Spencers kept steady. Great Universals eased Ve. William Whiteley changed down to 6s 6d. Guinness was conspicuous among BREWERIES with a gain of 2s 3d to 81s, bargains up to 82s 6d being reported. Bass were up 2s 6d to 97s 6d, South African Breweries Is 6d to 100s and Watney Is 3d to 51s 3d. Newcastle were up Is 3d to 53s 9d. TOBACCO issues were very firm, with Im- perials %, higher at 5'\"/ and British- American harder at 4%,. In FOODSTUFF issues, Rio Flour Mills were 9d better at 18s 3d and Ranks 6d up at 16s, but Spillers Deferred shed 9d. Smith's Crisps were Is lower at 25s. American Industrials were higher, with Bethlehems 116, U.S. Steels 96%, Nickels 52%, Chryslers 107% and General Motors 65%. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS EASY Rubber share quotations pursued a course similar to that of yesterday. Dur- ing Stock Exchange hours the commodity was unchanged, with the result that little interest was taken in the share market. Prices were marked down fairly generally, more from lack of support than actual liquidation. Occasional small purchases were made in the florin group with corresponding improvement in prices. London Asiatic moved up from 3s 3d to 3s 4d, and demand for Semenyih raised the quotation 3d to 2s 9d. Among the leading descriptions, United Sua Betong lost 6d to 47s, Rubber Trust were a shade lower at 27s (against 27s 3d), together with Allied Sumatra at 15s 9d (16s). Elsewhere a weak feature was Sedenak, which closed Is 6d cheaper at 20s. In Mincing Lane, Rubber shares were little changed in price. Rubber Trust finished at 27s 6d and Anglo-Dutch at 25s 6d. Rambutan were buyers at Is. Tea shares were firm on the Stock Ex- ~change, though trading remained light. Assam Company marked at 14s and Im- perial 17s 6d. In the \"Lane \" South Wanarajah Preference realised 20s, and there were sellers of Ceylon Land and Produce. Rubber and Tea Prices Page 4 TRINIDAD OILS BOUGHT OIL shares continued in the ascendant. There was no slackening of the demand for several of the recently favoured stocks, and prices of a number of shares enjoyed further sharp improvements. Marked preference still was shown for shares in companies operating in Trinidad and South America, both of which are considered to be well removed from possible conflict. Trinidad Leaseholds were outstanding with an advance of %2 to 4'%Y,, and Trinidad Petroleum Develop- ments also were to the fore with a rise of Is to 53s. Anglo-Ecuadorians were favoured again and rose Is to 20s 6d, and there was a further improvement of 7%d in Lobitos to 40s. Mexican Eagles were inclined to dulness at 5s 1d, but Canadians moved up 4%d to 9s ld. Burmahs gained %' to 3'/a, but Anglo- Iranians remained rather in the back- ground at 3%/i. Amsterdam sales were largely responsible for a setback in Royal Dutch, which were 1% lower at 39%. Shells hardened %,2 to 4\"/,. Oil Share Prices Page 4 DULL TONE IN MINES Australia's New Gold Tax Reduced Kaffirs turned dull chiefly owing to a dwindling of business that was naturally attributed to caution in front of the week- end interval. There was little selling, but the absence of fresh support caused prices to lose anyway part of yesterday's gains. Also belated cables resulted in Johannes- burg trying to liquidate tiny lines of the more speculative issues bought in yester- day's more bullish atmosphere. Ventersposts lost %e to 1%6, as did Western Reefs to %., while Western Hold- ings relapsed 9d to 8s. Of the producers, East Geduld at 10% and Sub Nigels at 9% each fell %. Other recessions were not often more than %s. The final list, on the other hand, was not entirely devoid of rises. On a relaxation of the recent special pressure to sell, Gold Fields re- covered % to 2%. Central Mining Bearer were % to the good at 14%. A small de- mand put Simmer 6d better at 16s 9d, and Marievale hardened 3d to 14s 3d. West Africans were extremely quiet. Ashantis reacted s. to 3%. Bremang at 2s 9d and Konongo at 3s 4%d weakened 3d apiece. Among Australians, the only movement of note was the marking down of Youanmi Preference by Is to 3s 6d. REVISED PROPOSALS It was not until after market hours that the news came through of a favourable re- vision of the extra Australian gold tax re- cently announced. The Commonwealth Government is now to take only half the mines' revenue above Â£9 Australian per ounce for gold instead of three-quarters as originally intended. At the present price or siu 1us Australian tnls means tnat tne mines will retain Â£9 15s, equal to Â£7 16s sterling. In the Indian group, Champion Reef yielded Vi to 2. Elsewhere, Oriental Cons. were maintained at their recently advanced level of 2%. Dealers in Rhodesian Coppers reported a moderate amount of business. Roan attracted chief attention with a consequent gain of 6d to 17s 6d, but Rhokana declined . to 12 and Rhodesian Anglo-American 3d to 22s 9d. Tanganyika Preference dropped 6d to 8s 6d. Chartered hardened 3d to 19s '6d. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto were raised y to 11%. Tins were quiet. Tronoh and Sungel Besi both lost /. to \"'%, and Mawchi %, to 1%'. Hongkong improved %A to 1 and Petaling 3d to' 49s. Among Lead-Zincs, the Barriers were featureless. Burma Corporation put on 3d to 9s 3d. Mining Share Prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "Opinion in Throgmorton Street sug- gests that forced selling, mainly in con- nection with the adjustment of contango positions, is completed for the present. The last two or three days have seen a better atmosphere on the Stock Ex- change, and brokers have received many tentative inquiries for good class securi- ties, particularly for the leading Tobacco and Brewery shares, the de- clines in which appear to be overdone. Emergency Budget considerations tend to restrain public enterprise and business accordingly has proceeded on a narrow basis. When the worst is known-that is, the anticipated in- creases in taxation-potential investors will be able to make up their minds as to the direction in which they should invest. Many sound stocks, which have suffered serious depreciation in value, should attract attention. Home Railway Yields Home Railway stocks appear to possess speculative possibilities for the near future. Since control of the four systems was assumed by the Govern- ment, the market in the junior stocks has been lifeless, but in the last day or two has shown signs of reviving. Any- way, stocks that were difficult to sell a week ago are not readily obtainable now at the minimum prices. This change of sentiment is on the expectation that the terms of the Government \"occupation \" of the pro- perty will be announced soon. In interested market circles it is believed that the compensation will be based upon the average of the receipts for the past three years. If anticipations prove well founded, compensation on this basis would be re- garded as reasonable and certainly fair, bearing in mind that the last completed year (1938) was one of the poorest ex- perienced for some time. The three-years' average would per- mit full dividends on L.M.S. Four per Cent. First Preference and on Southern Preferred Ordinary. Quoted to yield 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. respectively these stocks look attractive. Even if Southern reduced the dividend to 4 per cent, the return would be 8 per cent. and certainly worth having. Industrial Share Prospects There is' no question that the main- tenance of a number of dividends this week, including the interims of Imperial Chemicals and British Alumi- nium, and the year's rate on Murex have had a tonic effect upon the Indus- trial market. These decisions have allayed the fears entertained in some quarters that the leading undertakings, as a matter of policy, might have to conserve their cash resources by reducing dividends. The maintenance of payments can be taken as a gesture that the immediate outlook is regarded by the respective Boards with some confidence. Other undertakings, however, may take another view according to the re- action of present commercial conditions upon the fortunes of the businesses concerned. So far as one can judge, there is nothing in the outlook which suggests that good class Industrial shares should not be bought. Discrimi- nating investors should find more in favour of purchases than .against buying. 9tritas Articles by \" Autolycus \" appear as usual on other days of the week.",

   "text_content" : "in modern warfare, mobilisation of industry is scarcely inferior in import- ance to the mobilisation of the fighting forces. The latter are helpless without the weapons, the ammunition and the multitudinous other supplies which they need and which industry alone can pro vide. The Government therefore is pro ceeding on the right lines in seeing that the essential manufacturing capacity of the country is organised for the pur- poses in view. The Supply Council which will be in control has wisely been given a substantial proportion of mem- bers who are business men of wide ex- perience. Their influence should be sufficient to ensure that enterprise is not strangled with red tape, and that effective liaison is maintained with the actual producers. Only in that way will it be possible to secure the maximum of efficiency from the industrial machine. While the task of serving the fighting forces must be paramount, that of maintaining our overseas trade also is of the utmost importance. The length of the war is unpredictable, and if it should prove protracted there will be an increasing need of exports to strengthen the resources from which payments for our essential raw materials as well as foodstuffs must be made. It follows, therefore, that the system must be as elastic as is compatible with efficiency, and a further reason for this is the inherent nature of war. This one will not stand alone in meriting the description of being a war of surprises, applied to it in advance by Mr. Leslie Burgin on Thursday night. Its early days have already caused astonishment by their lack of demand on our anti- aircraft defences, although that is far from impugning the correctness of the priority given to anti-aircraft require- ments. The point is that as and when land operations develop, and our mili- tary forces grow, the need for other categories of supplies will become in- sistent. That will be the time when it will be necessary to gather the first- fruits of industrial mobilisation, and when the country will reap added bene- fit from the protection afforded to its towns and its factories against enemy action from the air. It is so far fortunate that concentra- tion upon defence work and the plan- ning of the last few years have given us a flying start. The supply organisa- tion has already at its disposal some 9,000 firms in production or ready for an early change-over to war output- industry's first line, as it were. All of them no doubt will soon be working to full capacity, but in reserve are the many undertakings which, during the present period of transition, have lost their peace-time occupations and have not yet been absorbed into the war- machine. Where their activities and equipment are suitable, they offer the best opportunity for rapid expansion of supply, and the utilisation of their ser- vices should be hastened as much as possible. Every undertaking that can fit into the scheme should be able to feel assurance that the help it can proffer will receive rapid and sympa- thetic consideration. That will be the case if the spirit of the national need is present and is operative throughout the whole supply organisation, from the Minister downward. In action it will have more than one important result, not the least valuable of which will be its effect in aiding the social and economic machinery of the country to begin functioning more normally through the absorption of workers thrown out of employment temporarily by the dislocation due to the war.",

   "text_content" : "A reflection of the lower rate of activity in the heavy industries last year is seen in the further decline in profits of Thos. W. Ward, the well- known Sheffield engineers and ship- breakers. Owing to the wide range of its activities, which vary from machin- ery, iron and steel to cement making and quarrying, the company is sensi- tive to trade fluctuation at many points. Net profit last year fell by Â£37,500, or 20 per cent., to Â£151,000, which compares with the exceptionally high level of Â£240,400 in 1936-37. As a substantially larger sum was brought into the accounts, the disposable balance is only Â£8,000 less, and it is possible to repeat the 10 per cent. divi- dend for the third successive year. The 2j per cent. cash bonus paid a year ago was an exceptional item, in celebration of the company's diamond jubilee. Reserve fund is brought up to Â£150,000 by the addition of Â£15,000 as before, and the carry-forward is in- creased by Â£6,800 to Â£105,900. The smaller trade movement is shown by a reduction of Â£349,800 to Â£706,300 in stocks, but debtors are Â£20,300 more at Â£665,500. The increase from Â£389,900 to Â£542,400 in shares in subsidiaries was presumably due mainly to the in- terest taken in the Darlington Railway Plant and Foundry Works, as the ac- quisition of the Triumph Company of Coventry was not notified until after the close of the financial year.",

   "text_content" : "ThanKs to the far-sighted policy of John Crowther and Sons (Milnsbridge) in maintaining equipment at the highest efficiency the company was able to earn slightly increased profits last year de- spite unfavourable conditions. The in- stallation of automatic looms and card- ing machinery enabled the company to meet on favourable terms the high degree of competition in the woollen and worsted industry, in which the original business has been engaged since 1840. Trading profit was some Â£20,000 more at Â£184,100, but owing to the heavier taxation charge the net profit came out only a few hundreds more at Â£65,600. AS nothing is carried to staff pension scheme, compared with Â£13,800 a year ago, the disposable balance is actually larger and the 10 per cent. dividend is paid for the third year in succession with a good margin. Additions to re- serve since the company became public three years ago have brought the total to Â£55,000, the contribution from the past year's revenue being Â£20,000 against Â£10,000. Stocks are Â£48,900 higher at Â£527,100, and debtors have also risen by Â£79,000 to Â£209,400, illus- trating the larger turnover. In the cir- cumstances, the results are justly claimed as satisfactory.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The sharp recovery in sterling in the black market in New York was the sub- ject of favourable comment in London yesterday and the belief was expressed that the closing of the gap was not merely temporary. Despite reports to the contrary, it is understood that the New York market in sterling has been very small rela- tively. Incidentally, it gave a little impetus to our luxury exports. It is also learned that forms outlining the reasons for requiring foreign currency are now being more carefully scru- tinised by the Control office at the Bank of England. The hope is expressed, however, that the authorised dealers and other banks will have more definite limits placed on their powers of passing forms and that more rigid rules will be laid down as to what may or may not be done. Cheap Borrowing Yesterday's tender for Â£55,000,000 of Treasury bills was of more than usual interest, since it included the ever- popular end-December maturity. This year, in particular, the bills dated 30th September were more than ever in re- quest because, as 30th December falls on a Saturday, the market will not be able to force the Government to do the end- year borrowing. Ample maturities on that day, therefore, will be very wel- come. This factor was responsible for the drop of approximately a per cent. in the average rate as compared with a week ago. The position next Friday will be rather different as the bills then avail- able will be January maturities. Much depends upon whether Bank Rate is reduced in the interim but, for the moment, the market is making little change in its buying rates for bank drafts. Dutch Hoarding According to advices from Amster- dam, Dutch nationals are apparently hoarding large amounts of silver guilders as well as old ten-guilder gold coins, in which the banks are permitted to trade with the general public. These latter coins, it is reported, now com- mand a premium of anything up to 14 per cent. over the dollar parity. The Netherlands Bank which, in the past, had been willing to part with some of its large stock of gold coins has apparently ceased to be so obliging. In consequence, the market for gold coins is no longer under its control.",

   "text_content" : "ine long- arawn-out negotiations tor a fusion of interests between Arding and Hobbs and John Anstiss and Co. have produced a fresh scheme for the sinan- cial side of the proposal. Arding and Hobbs is one of the most important of London's suburban departmental stores, and John Anstiss, which has made rapid progress during recent years, has stores in Salisbury, Romsey, Petersfield, Swin- don, Cirencester and Worthing. The present proposals are a simplification of the earlier scheme, and have the approval of the shareholders' committee appointed last June. Arding and Hobbs is to adjust the book value of its assets by writing down the Ordinary capital by Â£38,66C, thereby reducing each Ordinary Â£1 share to 10s. The equity of John Anstiss is to be purchased at par by the exchange of Â£43,000 Ordinary capital, representing less than Â£11,000 on the basis of the quotation of 5s for Arding and Hobbs Ordinary. Neither class of Preference share of the latter company is affected. Dividends are in arrear as from February, 1938, and these will be liquidated as earnings permit. The position of the Preference shares par- ticularly should be strengthened by the merger to the extent of any revenue re- ceived from the Anstiss holding. The First Seven per Cent. Preference Â£1 shares are quoted around 8s 9d and the WrEits at 7s 6d.",

   "text_content" : "The hydraulic engineering business of J. Blakeborough and Sons, of Brighouse, includes also that of valve- making and iron and brass fbundry work. It has earned progressively better results in the last few years. With the assistance of new plant the handicap of severe competition has been overcome and for the twelve months ended 30th June the profit has been raised from Â£51,100 to Â£67,600, after providing for depreciation and taxation. This is an excellent result, since the balance of earnings is equal to 52 per cent. on the Ordinary capital after providing for notes service, Preference dividend and setting aside Â£10,000 as a pension reserve. Payment of a total 20 per cent. on the Ordinary capital, an increase of 5 per cent., is therefore conservative, but in view of current uncertainties the retention of so large a proportion of earnings is doubtless sound. The financial position is good, current assets of Â£303,700 being approximately three times the amount of creditors. At the date of the accounts Â£48,000 Seven per Cent. notes were outstand- ing, but these are being redeemed at the rate of Â£5,400 annually.",

   "text_content" : "A deputation of the London Metal Exchange will shortly lay before the Ministry of Supply the grievances of dealers aris- ing out of Government regulations affecting the sale of base metals. Grievances may be classified under three headings:- (1) The maximum prices specified for copper, lead and zinc make no allowance for dealers' commissions. (2) The cost of the Government commodity stock insurance scheme cannot be passed on to the consumer. (3) In the case of tin, dealers are forbidden to resell at a substantial profit in the United States metal bought in London for about Â£230 a ton, a practice exercised by American firms. Hope of meeting the trade's difficul- ties has not yet been abandoned. The Government, in fact, is known to view sympathetically the claim for fairer treatment. But dealers, while admitting that some dislocation is unavoidable in the change-over from peacetime to war- time conditions, are urging the need for utmost speed in restoring order. Many state frankly that if present conditions are allowed to persist their businesses will be threatened with extinction, or at least be subjected to severe curtail- ment. MAXIMUM PRICES Insurance Costs The Ministry of Supply is believed to have under consideration a scheme for reimbursing commissions to traders who have recently been satisfying the needs of industry. At present a manu- facturer's order for, say, standard cop- per has to be transacted on the basis of the maximum price of Â£46 a ton. If the dealer has no metal available he ap- plies to the Government, which may supply it at the maximum price with no concession to the middleman. The alternative dealing possibility is even less encouraging. If a dealer has metal stored he may not pass on the insur- ance costs. Cases have occurred of persons who bought lead beforr. the war at Â£16 a ton. To this has to be added 12s fid warehouse charges and rather more than 6s a ton for commodity insurance. Thus on the official maximum selling price the dealer is faced with a loss of about 6s a ton. And this at a time when lead is quoted at about Â£20 in Belgium. In these circumstances some firms are unable to cover their overhead expenses. In many cases such deals are only being done to oblige long-standing clients and preserve connections. The complicated framework of control, inevitable as it may be during the early stages of a war, has other dangers. By impairing the freedom of the market it threatens London's predominance as an international exchange centre and jeopardises a valuable source of invisible revenue. On the London Metal Exchange yester- day, cash tin declined 10s to Â£227 17s 6d, while three months fell Â£1 5s to Â£226 7s 6d a ton, 400 tons changing hands.",

Protection of French in- dustry against competition now becomes a secondary matter, the major aim being to keep France supplied with the best pos- sible material for the smallest amount of exported gold. Official and private pur- chases will continue to be made through regular commercial channels. Exports will continue unrestrictei ex cept for a limited number of products in- dispensable to national defence, and the only condition is the undertaking to re pat-iate foreign exchange sale proceeds."

   "text_content" : "By our POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT The impression prevailed in political circles last night that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in framing his first war- time Budget to be opened next Wednesday will spread the net widely, rather than severely. It was pointed out that in finance, as in everything else, the Government is legis- lating on the basis of a three-years' war. The Chancellor is expected, therefore, only to introduce certain instalments of war taxation next week and his Budget may be designed in part to recoup the revenue from losses inevitably caused in the potential yield of duties imposed in the last Budget. The motor-car duty, for instance, will show a greatly diminished yield owing to the effects of the black-out and petrol rationing. The petrol duty will a'so be down owing to the curtailment of motor and transport services. The Chancellor has also to consider that taxation is to some extent already on a war basis. The impression gained ground yester- day that there will be changes in income- tax, surtax, death duties, tobacco, beer, spirits, and perhaps one of the breakfast- table taxes. A substantially increased yield may be expected from N.D.C., the incidence of which may be altered. Income-tax payers will have to begin next January to pay the increased demands expected to be announced by the Chan- cellor. Notices and assessments, prepared on the basis of the April returns, are being held back, and if, as is expected, the pre- sent rate of 5s 6d in the pound is increased, the new tax will be levied on last year's incomes.",

The provisions of the previous order regarding restriction of the purchase and sale of iron and steel except under license are retained and the schedule of maximum prices remains un- altered. A new provision enables the Minister to call for returns and information in regard to stocks and the businesses of concerns engaged in the production, merchanting and consumption of any of the controlled materials. The Control of Iron and Steel (No. 3) Scrap Order, 1939, also issued last night prohibits the sale or purchase of scrap iron ar.d scrap steel except under license. Iiximum prices for a wide range of classes of scrap iron and steel used in the industry are fixed.

   "text_content" : "rome Railway stocks were a feature of strength on the Stock Exchange yes- terday. A demand for the more popu- lar Ordinary stocks produced a further rise in quotations. Great Westerns put on a point at 24J and L.M.S. J at 11J. Buying was attributed to a rumour, which remained unconfirmed, that the Government compensation to the rail- ways for use of the lines would be an- nounced over the week-end. Prior charge stocks also hardened. L.N.E. First Preference and L.M.S. 1923 Preference were marketable at their un- official minimum prices of 28 and 34 re- spectively. L.M.S. Four per Cent. Prefer- ence could actually be sold at % above their fixed selling price of 48. LARGER TURNOVER Dealings in general were still largely a question of matching buyers and sellers, but a better demand was in evidence and many brokers reported a slightly larger turnover. Industrial shares moved irregularly, but rises outnumbered falls, and business was said to be a little more active. Breweries were among the sections to present good features. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial share index rose to 85.4, against 84.8 on Thurs day and 83.8 on Wednesday. One reason put forward for the harder general tendency was the announcement that the Emergency Budget will be pre- sented next Wednesday. Buyers were said to have been encouraged by the know- ledge that tax uncertainties will soon be dispelled. Cheerfulness was also encour- aged by the successful completion of Thursday's Settlement. U.S. STOCKS ADVANCE American stocks were bid for on over night advices from the San Francisco Stock Exchange. That centre was still open when President Roosevelt was delivering his broadcast address to Congress. From a closing price on Wall Street Thursday afternoon of $78%, United States Steel Common shares were bid up by San Francisco to 81. Other leading stocks were advanced half-a-dollar or so above the Wall Street close. In London United States Steel opened yesterday morning at 95% and later rose to 96%. Stock Exchange members have noted with satisfaction that banks are now pre- pared to advance money against American securities which have been, or are to be, registered at the Bank of England under the Treasury restriction on dealings in foreign stocks. The only conditions are that the advances must be in sterling and the head offices of the leading banks must be in the United Kingdom (not London as previously -eported).",

   "text_content" : "Treasury oiiis otferea at the weeKly tender yesterday included the popular end year maturities and were consequently placed at a lower rate than their prede- cessors. The intervention of the Christmas holi days and the incidence of the year-end caused a variety of applications. The market syndicate, for example, bid Â£99 3s lid for the Monday bill, which will mature on Christmas Day (Monday, 25th December) and will be repaid on Saturday, 23rd December. It is, therefore, an 89-day maturity, and the actual rate of discount represented by the bid is much the same as the average tender rate. Tenders for the Tuesday bill, which will be payable on Wednesday, 27th December, as Boxing Day is a Bank Holiday, were at Â£99 3s 4d and, as with the Monday bill, applicants received a full allotment. The popular bills were the Wednesday to Saturday dates, more particularly the last-named. The price in this instance was Â£99 3s 6d, and the syndicate obtained a quota of 66 per cent.-an excellent per centage in view of the larger applications now being put in. All the available bills were allotted at an average rate of dis count of Â£3 6s 1.25d per cent., compared with Â£3 11s 1.12d a week ago. Applications totalled Â£86,500,000, against Â£89,165,000.",

Telegrams: \" Finanttimo, Ave., London.\" Anxious, Hindhead-They are all first-class concerns and we see no reason to change the opinion previously expressed that the .hares should be held. F. S.-There is every reason to expect that the company will pay reasonable dividends and in time the shares should recover to some extent. In our opinion they should be held. K. F., Ramsey-1. All are sound concerns and the shares should be held. 2. There is prac- tically no market in these and it is useless to attempt to sell now. 3. We would wait a.while before considering a purchase of these. Ieon-1. Although the price of the stock has fallen it is sound enough and we think it would be a mistake to sell at the present time. 2. In view of the uncertain outlook we would defer purchases for the present. 3. Over the period mentioned there is a reasonable prospect of some capital appre elation in both the shares named. N.

Do not sell just now unless you must. Silver-1. The company has good prospect; and if you are prepared to lock the shares away for a time a purchase would be likely to prove satisfactory 2. We would hold, but would not be in a hurry to average. 3. The fall is due to general conditions. We would hold in hope of eventual recovery. Westandeast-It is a sound concern and there is no reason to doubt that it will be able to fulfil its obligations. If you withdraw the money we do not see how you could reinvest it to better advantage and in our opinion you should remain as you are. X I.

They are pre- liminary and provisional and relate to 11th September, the full details of which will be forthcoming in the first week of next month. Net effect of the new conditions was an increase of 99,000 in the number of work- less. Male workers unemployed fell by 76,000, but women rose by 175,000. The latter number included many evacuated women and others who offered their services. Over most of the country there was a reduction in workless among men and a roughly equivalent increase in women on the registers. In London and South- Eastern Counties there was a rise among both men and women. Industries with more workless included hotel and boarding-house service, dis- tributive trades, entertainments and sports and fishing. In some districts furniture, tailoring, some textiles, motor- car manufacture and dock service also declined. Improvements were reported in coalmining, iron and steel and the engineer and shipbuilding.",

This statement is made in a letter sent by Mr. Peter Bennett, president of the federation, to the Prime Minister, copies of which have been circulated to all the federation's members. \" Now that we are at war,\" he says, \" I desire, as president of the federation, to state that it is more than ever realised by industry that unreasonable increases of prices are against the national interest. Apart from that over-riding consideration, it is against the interests of industry itself that such increases should take place, since industry is not only a producer but also an immense consumer of industrial products and raw materials.\" Mr. Bennett adds that the matter will be brought before the F.B.I.
