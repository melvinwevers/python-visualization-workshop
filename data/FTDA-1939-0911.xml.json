SATURDAY Afternoon. With the opening of the banks to- day until one o'clock, the Money mar- ket session was extended by an hour, but turnover did not justify the extra hour's business. Credit was plentiful, with loans over the week-end easily obtainable at 2 per cent., although some lenders asked for higher rates. The tone of the discount market was steady, with three months fine bank bills again quoted at 3% per cent., although longer dates were quoted a little lower by some houses. \" Hot \" Treasury bills were inquired for by quarters outside the clear ing banks at 3% per cent. Clearers were buyers of Octobers at 3%s per cent. and Novembers at 3% per cent. for delivery next week. LOANS DISCOUNT PER CENT. PE CENT.

Friday's silver price was 21%icd per ounce for both spot and forward metal, and the official gold price was 168s per ounce fine. Several changes were made in exchange rates fixed by the authorities. Canadian dollars were dearer again at $4.32-$4.36, although the United States dollar was un- changed. The Brussels rate was also lower, but quotations on Oslo, Stockholm and Buenos Aires were raised.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 10th Sept. Buying of stocks was resumed from the opening on Saturday, but week-end evening-up and profit-taking reduced net gains. The general close was steady, with most of the list fractions to a point higher. Shippings and Shipbuildings, Steels and Chemicals recorded advances extending to 4 points. Bethlehem Steel jumped 2% to the new 1939 high of 88s, on top of Friday's big gain of 5 points; the company has been awarded an order by the Maritime Com- mission for ten cargo ships costing $19,400,000. International Mercantile Marine was the most active stock and rose 3' to 14%. Electric Boat went up 2% to 15%. New York Shipbuilding and Bush Terminal also forged ahead. Rails kept firm and Aircrafts steady; but Motors were irregular and Utilities easier. The Dow-Jones Industrials average closing price improved 0.87 to 150.91, and Rails 0.11 to 30.51; Utilities declined 0.17 to 23.68. Turnover for the two-hour session reached 1,560,000 shares, covering 845 stocks, of which 428 rose, 242 declined and 175 were unchanged. U.S. Government bonds eased, but Rail- road issues were strong; bond sales totalled $19,950,000. Sterling closed Yc higher at $4.052. Moody's commodity index (31st December, 1931=100) was 167.5, against 167.7 on Friday. Some reversal of the recent upswing in stocks and commodities is possible soon, if only for technical reasons, and a 10- point day's break in stocks would not be surprising. The Industrial share average, now at 150, may fall back to the 1st Sep- tember level of 135, but is expected eventually to reach 175. The \"New York Times\" business activity index for the week tr 2nd Septem- ber is 94.1, against 92.3 for the previous week and 85.3 a year ago.",

   "text_content" : "Failing any dramatic fresh develop ment in world affairs the Stock Ex change is likely to do little more thai mark time this week. Business will b pretty well completed in the first hou: or two, although the House is not tb close until two o'clock. Quite apart from the desire to clea: the decks of pre-war positions befor taking on board a large cargo of casl bargains, questions of investmen policy cannot be readily decided unti Sir John Simon opens his supple mentary War Budget. Gold Share Uncertainties The great unknown for the Empire'i gold mines at the present stage is hov the various dominion Governments will deal with individual labour, impor anc cost of machinery, necessary sup plies and taxation problems. That is n( reason for selling Gdld shares, but ma] make discrimination in fresh purchaser advisable. South Africa has already set up i perilous precedent by the decisior that the Union Treasury shall appro priate anything above 150s per ounci which may be received for the Rand's gold output. However, this semi-con fiscatory plan has still to be reaffirme( by the new Government under Genera Smuts, and even then will requirn legislative sanction. It is an unfavour able omen that the Southern Rhodesiar Government has now also decided thai anything above 150s for gold shall be taken by the State. Australians Tantalise Australian gold mines are, perhaps the ones for which the outlook is mosi tantalisingly uncertain. In Australiar currency gold is now worth what seem, the almost fantastic price of 10 guineas an ounce. But as the Commonwealtl Government has now forbidden the ex port of the metal it would not be sur. prising if it exacted a direct or indirect toll before paying the mines for their gold. Income-tax and company tax arn being raised by the Budget introduced last week. Anyway, the Australian companies will no longer be abiÃ½-to make the extra exchange profit which some of them were recently securing by selling dollars forward against shipments of gold tc San Francisco. Further, they do not yet know what proportion of the profits earned in Australian currency they will be allowed to convert into sterling-at the present rate of exchange-to pro- vide for dividends and the cost of imported supplies. West Africa, which already takes 15 per cent. of the so-called gold premium, does not seem likely to require to raise any heavy additional revenue for war purposes. The Indian gold mines pay under their comparatively new leases sudh generous royalties to the State of Mysore that there should be no excuse for additional imposts upon them. Arbitrage Complications There are still complicated arbi- trage commitments with the Continen- tal Bourses, New York and some of the Dominion Stock Exchanges to be cleared up. For instance, an option dealer told me on Friday that he is due to deliver 250 United States Steel against a call. The jobber from whom he should in turn receive the shares has 140 on his book and is a bull in Amsterdam of the balance of 110 shares. Facilities will have to be sought to close this position with the Amsterdam counter-party, who may, in turn, have to buy the required shares from New York. Clearing - up operations such as these will, with good humour and an accommodating spirit on the part of the authorities, be carried through easily enough. But it must take time -in some cases considerable time- and until the special Settlement fixed for Thursday week brokers will not as a rule, wish to add more than they can help to their liabilities either to deliver or pay for stock. \" Operate in haste and repent at leisure\" is a motto suggested to me for these utterly abnormal times. bh 3IarMist",

   "text_content" : "nhe past week in the City nas pro- vided a new experience for the younger generation of investors. Old. timers need not be reminded that con. ditions are very different to those ruling in 1914. Then it became neces- sary to close the House for a time tc deal with the heavy bull account and the liquidation through neutral coun- tries of enemy-held securities. Now. adays, owing to exchange restriction.s, the Stock Exchange has lost much ol its international character and the need for restrictions upon dealings has become less insistent. With the declaration of war, the tension has become easier and mar kets no longer are sensitive to the European situation. Confidence in the ability of this country and France to meet the new situation has found expression in the lack of nervous sell ing and the comparative firmness of prices. DEARTH OF SELLERS In fact, the behaviour of markets has been somewhat of a pleasant sur- prise to the many who foreshadowed a slump in prices in the event of war. On the contrary, the resumption of business has revealed a dearth of sellers, and from this it may be assumed that nervous holders who feared the worst had long ago got out of their holdings. At the same time, Stock Exchange busi ness is being conducted under abnormal conditions. Dealings are for cash only. Bull and bear business simply does not exist, but it is some consolation to know that stale bulls have been allowed respite, if carry-over facilities are available. While the Committee desire that all outstanding bargains should be settled as soon as possible, most members agree that it has acted wisely in not compelling brokers to close down at once all existing open accounts. CASH BARGAINS ONLY Cash dealings do not make for a free market as jobbers as a rule will not sell stock that is not on their books, unless they have a reasonable expectation of securing it without undue delay. In other cases offers of stock have been limited. the basis of dealing now is by negotiation and a good deal of time is taken up in con -luding barygins in some instances, but eitibers are uininimtiis in theirirrei that t is better to have dealings on these lines than. to have the House closed to business for a time. It is hoped, of course, that the reversion to fortnightly settlements will not be long delayed. The past week has been one of transi tion. The advent of war has brought about a complete change in habits and business procedure. The completion of transactions has been impeded by delays in certifying transfers occasioned by the removal of the Bank of England stock office out of Lon- ion. Arrangements now announced for certifying transfers in London should have vercome this difficulty. Despite the restricted character of the business offering markets have not been acking in good features. The highlights ncluded the buoyancy of Shipping shares, ;trength of'Gold shares on the unprece- lented price of 168s per ounce for the metal and the activity in Rhodesian Copper shares on the idea that a maximum output from Rhodesia will be necessary to satisfy the war-time demands of the Empire. On the other hand fears of new taxation have weighed heavily upon Tobacco and Brewery shares. SHOCK WELL TAKEN Investment securities have taken the first shock of war remarkably well. Many prices ended, when the House closed on 31st August, at well over the minimum prices recently fixed. With the advent of war practically all have fallen back to the minima, or nearly so, mainly on the possi- bilities of increased taxation in the emergency Budget. As regards Foreign bonds wide and irregular price movements have been seen, mainly due to adjustments necessitated by war conditions. There has been some bear- closing of. German and other Central European issues. Some South American issues have been inquired for on the possi- bility of a larger demand for the com- modities of that continent as a result of the situation in Europe. Little attention has been given to Home Railway stocks pending information as to the terms upon which the Government has assumed control of the four main-line companies. Unofficial minimum prices wisely have been fixed by jobbers for the prior charge securities which to all in- tents and purposes are Government Guaranteed stocks for the time being. At the close of last week some demand was encountered for Argentine Rails. SHIPPING FEATURES Shipping shares have provided the star turn in the Industrial market. A string of inquiries disclosed that the market was short of stock and \" buyers only.\" Prices accordingly have been marked up freely and comparison with the quotations ruling at the end of August reveal improvements, on paper, of 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. in value. On Friday afternoon the market boiled over, the rise being overdone. In striking contrast has been the weakness of Aircraft shares. Apparently this was due to the growing belief while the leading companies may enjoy another year or two of prosperity, the end of hostilities is likely to mark a sensible reduction in the demand for military aircraft. The selling was not heavy, but it came on a market lacking ready buyers. RUBBERS HIGHER Bullish New York advices and the prospect of a large demand in the U.S.A. for the commodity are responsible for the rise in rubber -to 10d. While Rubber shares have been marked up the actual business done has been small. Leading Oil shares have shown an improving tendency, but here again the turnover has been light. With the yellow metal at Â£8 8s an ounce Gold shares have not made the response, for various technical reasons that might have been expected, but there has been some liveliness in West Africans under the lead of Ashanti Gold Fields (at one time' 75s bid) for the reason that no fresh taxa- tion has been imposed upon these. Pending reopening of the Johannesburg Exchange to-day there has not been much going on in Kaffirs. A point to be noted is that the new Government may not agree to fix the maximum price of gold for the companies at 150s, but this view is not general. Base metals have shown an up- ward tendency, notably copper, tin and lpan.",

   "text_content" : "The eyes of the Stock Exchange markets wait upon the introduction of the Supplementary Budget. That its provisions will be onerous is, of course, taken for certain. They will affect, it may be presumed, the Ordi- nary capital of most of the companies in whose shares there is a Stock Ex- change market. Until the provisions of the new Budget are known, and investment is able to calculate roughly the likely extent of its burdens, business in the industrial market will be held in check by this uncertainty. Business Conditions In spite of this, Stock Exchange markets are beginning gradually to settle down to war conditions. After all, these have only existed for little more than a week and clients, together with the House, have yet to get familiarised with the new order of things that war has brought about. The point to observe, and to em- phasise, is that dealings are possible in a great many cases. Because a price does not seem to happen at the time to suit a client, that is no reason why he should renounce any expecta- tion of his business becoming prac- ticable later on. Two o'Clock Closing The decision to close the Stock Ex- change from to-day at two o'clock brings the House into line with the banks. The petition to do this was pre- sented on Friday afternoon two minutes before the Committee sat, and it took .the Committee very little more than two minutes to accede to it. The petition was widely and rapidly signed when it came into circulation on Friday last. Until Stock Exchange business starts to expand, the further hour thus cut off should be useful to those engaged in A.R.P., A.S.S. and similar services. Johannesburg Reopens The Johannesburg Stock Exchange reopens to-day, the first time since it was closed just before the outbreak of war. Dealings for the Cape last week were not wholly impossible, but cer- tainly became extremely difficult. With the Johannesburg Stock Ex- change at work again, business between the two centres should become freer and to some extent make the market in Kaffir shares more flexible than it has been since war broke out. Cash Dealings The last occasion upon which deal- ings for cash were fixed for any length of time was in 1931. The Stock Ex- change reopened on Saturday morning, 19th September, after being closed on. ' Saturdays for nearly 141 years. A flood of selling from the Con- tinent poured into the Consol market On Sunday, 20th September, the coun- try went off the gold standard, Bank Rate was raised from 4J to 6 per cent., and the Stock Exchange ordered to be closed. Sunday Decision The House reopened on 23rd Septem- ber, 1931, and the Committee later in that week ruled that all dealings were to be for cash. This continued until November, 1931, fortnightly Settle- ments not being restored until the 16th of that month. In reference books and, perhaps, in other historical works, the date of de- parture from the gold standard, with its two immediate sequele, may be given as Monday, 21st September, 1931. Rigid Sabbatarians will no doubt con- tinue to believe it. Aulntales"

   "text_content" : "The war upon which we are now engaged has to be pushed on many fronts if we are to achieve rapid and complete success. Behind the army, navy and air force there has to stand an immense reserve of industrial and financial resources with which to sup- port every effort in the field. That re- serve has also to support the civilian population in its task of economic mobilisation. Thanks to the foresight of the Government, the co-ordination of civilian and military policy has within a few days of the opening of hostilities brought us to a high state of war preparedness. From this point we have now advanced to the stage of organising economic warfare upon the enemy with a view to destroying the industrial and commercial bases upon which his efforts in the field must eventually depend. This vital duty has been entrusted to a new Department, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, of which, it is satisfactory to note, the Director General is Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, one of the Government's most trusted advisers, who has an un- rivalled knowledge of international trade and finance. The nearest parallel to this Depart- ment in the last war was the Ministry of Blockade. The naval superiority which Britain undisputedly commands at the outset of the present hostilities enables the blockade of Germany to be instituted without delay. That is, how- ever, only the starting point of modern economic warfare, for action will have to be taken with a view to preventing supplies and foreign exchange from reaching Germany through other sources. Under present conditions there are many ways in which an enemy may secure economic assistance. The history of the white war waged by the Nazis on every democratic country shows that formation of closed currency areas has brought small nations under economic tutelage, robbed them of their foreign exchange assets, and subordi- nated their trade relations with Great Britain to the needs of German power politics. The time has now come when that has to be stopped for good and all. And the Ministry of Economic Warfare will have the task of devising the methods by which the Nazi technique of exploit- ing trade as an instrument of national policy can be effectively frustrated. The liaison now established with the French Government in this respect is a wel- come reminder of the fact that the unity of aims between the two countries has been extended to every front. There is no question of Great Britain's advantages from the standpoint of economic warfare. Her enormous financial resources are capable of easing the pressure on the home industrial front. Germany's lack of them must force the Nazis to pay for imports in the form of exports of manufactured goods, a possibility which is extremely restricted under present conditions of apparent overemployment in the Reich. Our task is threefold. We have to cut off Germany's imports via direct and indirect channels; we must sever German export connections with world markets; and finally we must capture foreign markets as they are ceded by her in order to help pay for our own military and civilian imports. All these things, we can be confident, will be done.",

   "text_content" : "The emergency regulations devised by the Stock Exchange Committee for the governing of market business seem to be working well so far as their re- strictive character permits. If the machinery creaks a little at times it is merely because jobbers and brokers, as well as the public, have still to become fully accustomed to the new order of things. The physical handi- cap of a closed House was quickly overcome by the reopening on Thurs- day. Since then another difficulty, peculiar to jobbers in the gilt-edged market, has been removed. Consider- able delay, resulting in effect in the tying up of jobbers' capital, was caused by the removal of the Bank of England's transfer offices to some 60 miles outside London. Now, the Bank is reopening in Threadneedle-street an office at which transfers of British Government and India Government stocks out of the names of jobbers can be certified. By this step jobbers will be out of their money for the minimum period. The new arrangement does not, how- ever, expedite payments for stock sold by the public, since transfers out of clients' names will still need to be effected through the new office of the Bank in the country. This is of minor importance compared with the fact that jobbers in gilt-edged securi- ties are now freer to develop the market. The Committee's recom- mendation for future settlements monthly of cash differences in connec- tion with business which is now being done on a cash basis is also one which should concern only dealers. These differences arise from jobbers' turn- over resulting from transactions in both directions with members of the public through the medium of brokers.",

Gross income from investments was Â£29,400, against Â£82,000, but net revenue was only Â£1,400 down at Â£13,500, owing to a saving in interest charges and income tax. The Ordinary dividend is inain- tained at 56 per cent. for the third year in succession. Owing to the applica tion of Â£2,900, against Â£4,100, to contingent fund reserve, the carry-for ward is kept at Â£5,500, as before. It , aS^ ';,, \" . : . I is not surprising, in view of the preva- lent Stock Exchange depression, that investments, valued at Â£500,800, show a depreciation which has widened from 17j per cent. to 233j per cent. An analysis of investments at 31st July shows that interesting changes have been made during the year. In general there has been a tendency to increase the holding of priority stocks, more particularly Preference issues, at the expense of Ordinary stocks. Geographically, holdings of concerns in the United Kingdom and the dominions have been increased and represent 68.25 per cent. of the total."

In 1937-38 the total of 35 per cent. was earned with a full 15 per cent. to spare, and it seems that in the twelve months to 30th June last the margin was somewhat larger. The net profit in the preliminary state- ment is shown at Â£33,600, against Â£32,200 previously.

The company owns some 60 stores in the Manchester area selling cycles, radio sets, garden requisites and the like on the instalment system. It is difficult to know how this type of busi ness will be affected by war condi tions, but the maintenance of the final dividend indicates a reasonable degree of confidence on the part of the direc tors. The 2s Ordinary shares are not an active market and on the basis of the last recorded deal, at 5s 11id, would yield a comfortable 11 per cent.",

The English operating company re- duced its dividend from 12J to 10 per cent., while the only income received by the Trust from its large bond and shareholdings in the O-Cedar Cor- poration of America was by way of the redemption at par, plus interest, of the small issue of First Mortgage bonds. Net revenue was therefore rather lower than before at Â£1,000. This is added to the carry-forward, bringing that item up to Â£11,400. O-Cedar's net profit fell from Â£4,800 to Â£3,700. The proportion of increased advertising charged to reserve for contingencies is reduced from Â£3,000 to Â£2,500, and after this deduction the lower dividend on the \"A\" and \"B\" Ordinary shares is just earned, leaving the carry-forward unchanged at Â£4,700.

   "text_content" : "c'ull recognition of the abnormal situation in the investment sphere was given by Mr. James Prain, chairman of the Second Alliance Trust, at the meet- ing on Friday. In the circumstances the past affords no guide to the future, and no attempt can be made to forecast results for the current year. At the moment markets and prices are mainly nominal in this country, and there are restrictions in America on the Trust's normal activities. The uncertain out- look is frankly admitted, with the possibility of some falling off in re- ceipts, if only for the natural tendency in a time of crisis to postpone dividends in order to conserve cash resources. There is an interesting explanation of the satisfactory outcome of the past year's operations, especially in view of the fact that the period was not, generally speaking, a favourable one for any form of business or financial activity. The previous year covered a phase of expansion, with a number of issues in all capital categories. Invest- ments purchased with the proceeds of those issues contributed nearly a full year's revenue, and as a result the gross income was materially larger.",

   "text_content" : "No doubt the policy of Hoover in dis- tributing less than earnings alone would warrant will -be adopted by many trading undertakings. While maintaining the payment on the Five and a-Half per Cent. Preference stock at the usual rate for the half-year, the company is reducing the interim divi- dend on the Ordinary from 3d per unit, or 5 per cent., to 2d per unit, or 31 per cent. For the whole of 1938 the com- pany paid 25 per cent., in the form of an interim of 5 per cent. and a final of 20 per cent. Net profits of Â£218,500 for the period were below the 1937 figure, although sales attained a record. The 5s stock units stand around 10s. It is explained that results to date would fully have justified a distribution on the scale of the previous year, but in view of the emergency it is con- sidered desirable to conserve the re- sources of the company. It is also impossible to forecast the prospect of future dividends. The possibility of a change-over to work of national import- ance is indicated by the statement that the factory is a self-contained engineer- ing unit, and the accumulation of a satisfactory volume of work of a national character is envisaged.",

   "text_content" : "An insight into some of the prob- lems facing an investment business was afforded to shareholders of the Staveley Trust on Friday by the Chairman. Mr. Julian Marks. Two years of depreciating Stock Exchange securities have enabled the company to make the necessary adjustments to place itself in as favourable a position as possible in the circumstances. It is fortunately placed to the extent that its reserve and carry-forward are almost equal to the amount of depre- ciation on investments, and the bank loan has been reduced to a point where the loan and creditors are approximately the same as cash and debtors. Profit during the past year arose mainly from dividends, as other kinds of business available in normal times was not practicable. On this account, expenses appear relatively high. In a time of crisis such as the year just ended, investment policy naturally gives occasion for much careful thought. It says much for the selec- tion of holdings, built up over a series of years, that they are, broadly speak- ing, such as the Trust would buy now at present prices, subject to one or two which have been affected more than others by the war, which is an entirely abnormal situatioq and was hot seriously expected.",

   "text_content" : "The. eighteenth ordinary general meet- ing of Staveley Trust, Ltd., was held on Friday last at Winchester House, Old Broad-street, E.C., MR. JULIAN D. MARKS (chairman and managing director) presiding. The Chairman, in the course of his speech, said: Gentlemen,-The main item in the balance-sheet is \"Investments at cost or under.\" Owing to the financial situation resulting from the events of the last two years, these were not worth the figure at which they appear. I think this must be the general experience of all investment and financial trusts at the present time. We are, however, probably better off than the majority because our reserve account and our carry-forward are nearly sufficient to make up for all this deprecia- tion. The exact figure is 98 per cent., compared with 100 per cent. 12 months before. I think the only other item in the balance-sheet which calls for comment is the loan from the bank. When the break in the value of Stock Exchange securities began two years ago this was an appre- ciable item. We have gradually reduced this, in difficult times, to a point where the loan and creditors are approximately the same as our cash and debtors. The profit of Â£20,224 is nearly all in- come from dividends and is equivalent to about 6 per cent. on the capital of the company. Expenses are approximately 2 per cent., leaving about 4 per cent. net. In relation to this year's profit expenses are high, but there has been virtually no business of the kind which normally sup- plements considerably our income from dividends and justifies our annual ex- penses. We have an organisation built up over a number of years that is well worth keeping, and it is usually found that good times take care of the bad. The matter will need careful consideration in the current year and is necessarily dependent upon events. The position at to-day's date, as con- trasted with the date of the balance-sheet, cannot be worked out. When normal deal- ings start again it should not be very different. There has been an appreciable improvement in the value of our dollar securities worth about Â£23,000. These are, of course, being offered to the Govern- ment. STEERING A MIDDLE COURSE You will, I hope, judge the accounts before you bearing in mind that they cover a period which started with the Munich crisis, includes the invasion of Czecho- Slovakia, the seizure of Memel, the in- vasion of Albania and ends four weeks before declaration of war. We expected a serious crisis in August of this yeai, but we frankly did not believe it would end in war. Throughout the year we have had to steer a middle course to ensure that what- ever happened your company would be in a sound and well-balanced position. It seems unlikely that the values of Ordinary shares expressed in sterling will be worse than they are to-day whatever, within limits, may happen to fixed interest bearing securities. For some time your Board has preferred Ordinary shares to fixed interest bearing securities although, for the sake of safety, we have felt obliged to hold a considerable proportion of the latter. This policy may turn out well for us, but you must remember in- dustrial companies will probably be operating under considerable difficulties. Our investments may be classified under the following headings: - Based on book value Per cent. Aircraft ............... .............. 4.9 American ............ ........... 7.5 Banks and financial ................. 8.8 Breweries ............................ . 1.4 Chemicals .. .................. 5.4 Construction and constructional material ........................... 4.9 Distributors and stores ........... 7.2 Electric and electrical equipment 1.5 Foreign Government and Cor- poration securities ............. 1.5 Iron, coal, steel and engineering... 15.7 Mines ............................... 1.4 Motor (accessories) and cycles ... 3.9 Primary producers (rubber, tea, cocoa and sisal) ......... ....... 6.2 Proprietary articles ................ 1.2 Railways-British ................ 2.0 Argentine .............. 5.5 Shipping ............................... 8.6 Textiles ....................... 3.3 Miscellaneous Industrials and others .......................... 9.1 \"WHAT WE WOULD BUY TO-DAY\" As usual, the detailed list may be seen by any shareholder on application to the Secretary. Naturally a long list of securities col- lected over many years shows several which we would rather be without, but when we looked at our list during last year we had to consider what it would look like whatever happened. Above all, to put it colloquially, whatever happened we must not be caught \" on the wrong leg.\" Now that we know it is war we can say, subject to the above reservation, that on the whole our securities are very much what we should buy at the present time at the present prices. I hope we may meet in more chierful conditions next year. The report and accounts were duly adopted, the auditors reappointed, the re- tiring director re-elected, and the meeting closed with a hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman.",

   "text_content" : "The annual ordinary general meeting of the Second Alliance Trust Company, Ltd., was held on Friday last in the company's office, Meadow House, 64, Reform-street, Dundee. After formal evidence of the proper call- ing of the meeting had been submitted, the Secretary read the auditors' report to the shareholders. MR. JAMES PRAIN (the chairman), in moving the adoption of the annual report, said: I have now to submit for your approval the directors' report and accounts for the year to 31st July last. We meet in the immediate shadow of the outbreak of war, and it will accord with your wishes, no doubt, if I deal very briefly on this occasion with the business of the meeting. DIVIDEND MAINTAINED ON LARGER CAPITAL The revenue figures are satisfactory and call for little comment. For the purposes of record, however, I should mention that the annual report of a year ago covered a period of expansion, issues of Preference and Ordinary capital, debentures and debenture stock having taken place in that year. The investments purchased with the proceeds of these issues have now contri- buted nearly a full year's revenue, and as a result gross income, amounting to Â£230,000, shows an increase of some Â£14,000. On the debit side of the account, income-tax, interest on borrowed money interim dividends on the Preference and Ordinary stocks and the proposed final dividends all call for payments which in the aggregate show an approximately similar increase. After giving effect to the Board's recommendations there is a surplus out of the year's revenue of Â£28,475, as compared with Â£27,670 a year ago. The result, therefore, is that revenue has been maintained at a level which permits us to repeat last year's distribu- tion of 21 per cent. on the increased Ordi- nary capital and povides us with a sub- stantial surplus to carry to contingent fund. In the balance-sheet there is one small matter to which I should refer. A sum of Â£10,000 was set aside in 1937 as a special reserve for taxation to provide for addi- tional liabilities arising in connection with past years. These matters have now been settled and the account has been closed by transferring the small balance remain- ing to contingent fund. THE FUTURE At the moment there is little I can usefully say regarding the prospects of the current year. Markets and prices in this country are for the present mainly nominal, while in America there are at present restrictions on our usual activities. Ihave no doubt matters will gradually adjust themselves and a certain volume of business will become possible. We can only await events and be prepared to adapt ourselves to changing conditions. The outlook for revenue is naturally some- what uncertain, and I think we must expect some falling off in receipts if only for the reason that in times of crisis and difficulty there is a tendency to postpone dividends in order to conserve cash re- sources. In this company we have, of course, no commitments comparable with those of commercial or manufacturing undertakings, and we have a freer hand to deal with the immediate interests of our stockholders when it comes to declaring dividends. Our main object will be to avoid, so far as is in our power, any sharp fluctuations, and with our large margin of earnings I have every reason to hope that we shall succeed. I have to acknowledge the valuable services of our staff during the year, and I now beg to move that the directors' re- port and accounts for the year ended 31st July, 1939, be adopted and approved, and that the final dividends be declared at the rates therein recommended--on Â£800,000 Preference stock at the preferential rate of 4% per cent. per annum and on Â£400,000 Ordinary stock at the rate of 12 per cent. actual, making 21 per cent. for the year, both subject to income-tax. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted.",

   "text_content" : "Compared with curresponding precau tions taken during the last war, one noteworthy difference of interest and im- portance to company officials is the re- moval of the registered offices. Business went on as usual during 1914-18 for the reason that air-raid attacks were expected to happen, and with rare exceptions did occur, at night. On the present occasion the possibility, or rather the certainty, of day-light raids is quite a different proposition. Offices are being evacuated or left in the charge of a nucleus staff, and the preservation of records, books and securities is effected by their removal to a registered office situated in the country. Certain books must by statute be kept at the registered office, and these will have to be transferred. The register of members, for instance, is one of the books that must be kept at the registered office, and be open to inspection. According to particulars published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES, persons who want to inspect the register of British-American Tobacco, hitherto kept in London, must go to Egham, Surrey. Imperial Smelting Cor poration, Zinc Corporation and New Broken Hill Consolidated announce that they have already removed their registers to Cobham, Surrey, but that the registered office remains at Gresham-street, thereby contravening the strict letter of the Conm panies Act. NOTIFYING ADDRESS The Companies Act, 1929, requires the domicile to be stated in the memorandum of association-for example, England or Scotland-but the actual postal address is filed at the Companies Registry in London or Edinburgh, as the case may be. All changes must be notified to the Registrar within 28 days. The place of domicile cannot, of course, be changed, but the registered office can be situated anywhere within the domicile. Thus a company domiciled in England can remove the registered office to any part of England, which includes Wales. But a company domiciled in England cannot remove the office to Scotland, nor can the registered office of a Scottish con- cern be removed to England. Short of registering as a new company, there is no way of getting over the unalterable domicile clause in the memorandum. Secretaries may be reminded that the company's name must be affixed outside every office or place of business. Similarly, every company incorporated outside the U.K. but' carrying on business within Great Britain must exhibit the name and country of incorporation at every place where it carries on business. It may be added that, where there has been a change in the situation of the registered office, the matter may become important in the event of liquidation. The registered office for the purpose of jurisdiction would be the place which has longest been the registered office of the company during the six months previous to the presentation of the petition.",

   "text_content" : "Lombard Street's first experience of one o'clock banking hours on Saturday left many discount houses speculating on the real necessity for an extension of working time on Saturday, when a reduction of business hours seems to have been the guiding rule of the authorities. The bill market normally makes its financial arrangements early in the day, and Saturday is no exception. In fact, recent Saturdays, with banking hours ending at noon, have found most bill brokers with nothing much to do for some time before 12 o'clock. Extension of the business half-day to one o'clock on Saturday merely left Lombard Street with an extra hour of enforced idleness in the City. Bankers, no less than discount houses, found the extra hour irksome. They, too, had finished work before 12 o'clock, and the public-as anxious as the City to get away-appeared to have little use for the additional hour of banking facilities. EASY MONEY One effect of the recent disturbance to the Money market has been to im- part a good deal of fluidity to money rates. Figures at which loans are available seem to depend to a greater extent than recently on the position of the lender. The discount market was able on Saturday to get loans at 21 per cent. without much difficulty, and it is quite possible that some balances remained unused. Despite this factor, the tone of the bill market remained steady and the recent easier tendency seems to have been checked. Although the market obtained its bills on Friday at a still lower rate than at the previous 'ender the excep- tionally high ratio of allotment of 94 per cent. has increased portfolios for the moment. The raising of next week's maximum allotment to Â£55,000,000 has also tended to steady the market. BANK RATE If, under the weight of money and clearing bank demand the fall in bill rates is resumed, then Bank Rate gossip will be freely heard. The official mini- mum has already ceased to be fully effective and some pundits have already discussed a reduction to 3 per cent, in stages. There are two schools of thought on this subject. Some authorities aver that the present level should be main- tained, as the cheap money policy of the Government had long outrun its usefulness and the new-fangled theories proved all wrong. Others declare that a cut in the rate would be a gesture of confidence which would have a wide moral effect as well as reducing the cost of the Government's short-term borrowing. But we must wait and see. SMALL EXCHANGE BUSINESS Some of the leading exchanges were adjusted on Saturday, but movements in rates mean little or nothing nowa- days. A feature of recent business is said to be the smallness of individual transactions. Dealers are not permitted to oper- ate \" inside\" the official quotations for the various exchanges. Incident- ally, there are many questions which have still to be settled and the posi- tion with regard to forward contracts maturing is not yet entirely clear. In some quarters the view is held that, as time goes on, further banks will be authorised to deal, since it is felt short-term borrowing. But we must wait and see. SMALL EXCHANGE BUSINESS Some of the leading exchanges were adjusted on Saturday, but movements in rates mean little or nothing nowa- days. A feature of recent business is said to be the smallness of individual transactions. Dealers are not permitted to oper- ate \"inside\" the official quotations for the various exchanges. Incident- ally, there are many questions which have still to be settled and the posi- tion with regard to forward contracts maturing is not yet entirely clear. In some quarters the view is held that, as time goes on, further banks will be authorised to deal, since it is felt LI~_L Â· that special banks should be appointed. Foreign exchange brokers, as such, have disappeared, but the opinion is held that some use may yet be found for their services, their lines and their connections. GOLD OFFERINGS From inquiries made at several of the leading banks-some authorised and other unauthorised-it is obvious that, during the first week of the new regimentation in the foreign ex- changes, the authorities will have had more foreign currencies offered to them than they have had to provide. One of the features, indeed, is the small extent to which clients of the various institutions have wished to transfer funds; on the other hand, there has been quite a satisfactory volume of conversion of dollar balances into sterling. It is understood, however, that the offering of gold coin and bullion has fallen short of expectations. It is thought that some holders of gold and gold coin are holding back either (a) because no definite date has been fixed by which holdings have to be de- clared and/or sold, or (b) because they hope to get a still better price. In more than one quarter it has been sug- gested that the Government should fix a date as quickly as possible. In view of many questions on the subject, it should be pointed out that genuine collectors' pieces need not be offered so that numismatists are per- mitted to retain their collections. Otherwise, any sort of gold ,coin, British or foreign, must be offered by residents in the United Kingdom. ANOTHER FORM Another set of instructions, with the inevitable form for completion, has now made its appearance, and has to be added to the long list of emergency regulations to be assimilated and observed by bankers and their staffs. This is a notice relating to sterling acceptance credits. It is stated that the objectives are to put the least possible hindrance in the way of United Kingdom essential imports or of exports from Empire sterling countries generally, to main- tain as far as possible the normal working of the London Money market, and to maintain London's inter- national financing without allowing leakages of foreign exchange. BANKS' OBLIGATIONS Banks opening credits have to satisfy themselves that the goods covered are permissible under the Licensing Regulations and do not con- travene the Trading with the Enemy Act. Application for Bank of Eng- land sanction has to be made if opera- tion of the credit will involve payment of sterling from a domestic to a foreign account. Credits covering goods moved to and from ports outside the United Kingdom and outside Empire sterling countries, or from ports outside such countries to other Empire sterling countries, may only be opened after previous permission has been obtained through an authorised dealer. Banks giving credits should satisfy them- selves that credit facilities are not being misused for speculation or eva- sion of the Defence Regulations. All this may seem a \" glimpse of the obvious,\" but it may at least be said that the acceptance credit rules should be easier of interpretation than some of the financial regulations of the past week. sne past weeg.",

Except with the permission of the Treasury, no person other than an authorised dealer will be allowed to buy or borrow any foreign currency or any gold from, or lend or sell any foreign currency or any gold to, any person not being an authorised dealer. Similarly no one will be permitted to take or send out of the United Kingdom any bank notes, postal orders, gold, securities or foreign currency. Subject to such exemptions as may be granted by order of the Treasury, it will not be lawful except with their consent to make an issue of capital in the United Kingdom, to make any public offer of securities for sale, or to renew or post- pone the date of maturity of any security maturing for repayment in the United Kingdom. A vote of credit for Â£500,000,000 was issued on Saturday in accordance with the announcement of Sir John Simon in Parliament on 1st September. The amount is required-beyond the ordinary grants of Parliament-towards defraying expenses which may be incurred during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for securing public safety, defence of the realm, maintenance of public order and fficient prosecution of any war, and for maintaining supplies and services essential to th- life of the community.",

   "text_content" : "Milhtl WAK INEEIJD Maintenance of essential supplies of non-ferrous metals will be the chief consideration of those operating the existing control schemes. It is not thought that the complete framework of regulation will be abandoned. Substantial modification in the operation of the schemes will inevitably have to be made. REQUIREMENTS ASSURED Large supplies of copper, tin and lead from Empire sources ensure that the requirements of Great Britain and her Allies will be fully met. Metals have meanwhile been placed under Government con- trol. Arrangements are proceeding for fixing maximum prices. In the first week of war a foretaste has been provided of the widespread changes which may be expected in the production and marketing of non-ferrous metals. The appointment by the Ministry oi Supply of a controller for these metals, following the ban on exports from this country, emphasises theii strategic importance. It is clear thai for the duration of hostilities oui Empire resources will be mobilised foi the national interest and that inter- national commodity control schemes existing and embryonic, will be rele- gated to the background. ZINC CARTEL BAR No Reconstitution Ensuring supplies for the Allied cause will be a first consideration, This will presumably prove incom- patible with the continued existence of the tin, copper and lead control schemes in their present form. It should also block effectively any further attempts to reconstitute an international cartel for zinc. The framework of the control schemes need not necessarily be discarded in all cases. The decision of the International Tin Committee, only two days before the outbreak of war, to raise the quota from 45 per cent. to 60 per cent. seems, in fact, to suggest that an attempt will be made to retain the machinery while ensuring that its operation will guarantee adequate supplies. It has to be remembered that neither Germany nor any of her potential allies is a' subscriber to any of the existing schemes. In the case of tin, Malaya is the chief participant followed by Bolivia, Dutch East Indies, Siam, Belgian Congo, and French Indo China in order of output precedence. Thus the maintenance of control is an Empire interest which cannot lightly be jettisoned. To remove all vestige of the regulation scheme would of itself hardly advance the allied cause. CHILE AND COPPER Supplies 40% Somewhat similar considerations apply to copper, lead and zinc, though Empire production of these metals normally represents a smaller proportion to the world total than in the case of tin. Never- theless in wartime there might be a dis- tortion of the customary trade channels which would interfere with the continued operation of output control. While more than half the copper im- ported into this country comes from Rhodesia, Chile supplies over 40 per cent. Australia and Canada furnish a high pro- portion of our lead, but Mexico has a fair share of the trade. Belgium is, with Canada, one of the chief sources of zinc. Circumstances might well arise in which it became desirable for a larger proportion of a particular metal to be drawn from Empire sources. Such might be the case, for instance, with Rhodesian copper. To such potential complications may be added others, including currency fluctua- tions which may play havoc with attempts at price regulation, and political frictions inseparable from wartime strain. It may thus be concluded that while hostilities may not be allowed immediately to destroy the form of existing regulation schemes they will, for their duration, effectively remove the content.

Jacques Rueff is appointed assistant governor of the Bank of France. -Exchange Telegraph. \"BLACK OUT\" EFFECT ON INDUSTRY Apart from the heavy industries wherE the incidence is greatest the outbreak oj hostilities is already having a markec effect upon a number of important in dustries not directly connected with the supply or manufacture of essential wai materials. Among these are gas and electric suppl3 companies, undertakings catering foi entertainment such as the cinema anc theatre companies and breweries. The effect of the nightly \"black out' has been felt particularly by gas and elec. tricity supply undertakings. The firsi effect has been the loss of their normall. heavy load for street lighting. In man3 cases local councils which utilise the ser vice of gas and power companies for this purpose- as distinct from those which owr and operate their own sources of supply- place their contracts by tender. The period of contract is usually three years but at least in some cases it is known thai an \"escape\" clause has been providec against the outbreak of war. In other directions too the lighting com- panies have been affected. Lower powerec lamps for interior lighting are being usec by many householders, while all outside illumination, including not only domestic lights but also the large advertising signs are prohibited. In the aggregate the loss of load from these sources is considerable CINEMAS HIT Entertainment companies, such as the cinema and theatre undertakings, have felt the full brunt of the effects of war. time restriction, for they have been all closed by Government order. In reception and neutral areas they are now to be allowed to reopen, but the loss of profits will no doubt be substantial. On the othez hand, experience in 1914-18 and in Spain would appear to indicate that entertain. ment does not lose its popularity in modern war-time. Representatives of film producers and employees discussed at the Board of Trade on Saturday the position of the British industry. There will be further discus- sions this week. Upon brewery companies the effect of the \" black out\" and of the closing of places of entertainment has been very marked, more especially in the suburbs. Manywho would otherwise have patronised cinemas and theatres have had resort to licensed premises. It will be recalled that in the last war the consumption of beer and spirits increased so greatly that special legislation was introduced to cur- tail it. The modern public house, with its greatly improved social amenities and comforts, is vindicating the progressive policy of the brewery Boards by the custom now being attracted.",

They feel, however, in view of the present emergency that it would be wiser, in order to conserve resources, to reduce the dividend. Stockholders, too, should be advised that as the factory is very largely a self-contained engineering unit, the directors have little doubt they will be able to accumulate a satisfactory volume of work of national importance.

Mexico believes that Britain will find it expedient to end the dispute over the Mexican Government's seizure of British oil properties.

The companies are taking similar precautions to guard their properties as in the former Great War when no trouble occurred at the mines. Thousands of employees are now acting as special constables. HOUSE PLANS SUSPENDED Local authorities have been asked by the Ministry of Health to suspend the prepara tion of new housing schemes and to enter into no further commitments. A circular to this effect which has been issued points to the urgent need for con- centrating the resources of local authori- ties and the building industry on national defence work.

   "text_content" : "Raising of the rubber export quota from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. and establishment of a Ministry of Supply market office in Mincing-lane are the first steps in the implementation of the Anglo-American rubber for cotton barter agreement. The rubber to be supplied to America under the pact is about 85,000 tons and the additional quota release will enable the contract to be com- pleted in seven months. From the viewpoint of shareholders in rubber-producing companies importance attaches to the fact that from now on- wards the Government will be supporting the market for the commodity by periodi- cal purchases. Adequate safeguards have been pro- vided against a sharp appreciation in prices, but it is probable that the quota- .ion will remain at a level reasonably satisfactory to the producers. More rubber will in future be coming out of the estates with a consequent lowering of overhead costs per pound. The pro- lucing companies will also benefit from the better prices now ruling. *The average export quota for 1939 will be 57Y per cent., in comparison with only >o per cent. for last year. Further, the basic quota for the whole of the restricted countries on which the export percentage s calculated is considerably higher for the current twelve months than for 1938. In any consideration of the outlook for rubber and Rubber shares the possibility of the regulation plan being abandoned must not be overlooked. While such an event would take some time to materialise t is an eventuality which, it is held, might well occur in existing circumstances. U.S. Rubber Market Page 1 Col, 1",

Exchange operations are subject to the intermediary of the Bank of France. Imports and exports are subject to authorisation, and all forms bs capital ex- port are forbidden-unless authorised by the Finance Minister-including the leav. ing abroad of the proceeds of exports. Power has been granted to subject foreign security holdings to similar regulations and, while no official decision has been taken yet, it is presumed that it will not long be delayed. The export and import of gold is for- bidden without the authorisation of the Bank of France. Violation of the new regulations carries penalties up to Frs.100,000 and/or six months' imprison- ment, with imprisonment up to five years for a second offence. PROPERTY CONCESSION Foreigners and French nationals resid- ing abroad, overseas branches of French companies and foreign corporations may transfer cash and property or its counter value in the event of ownership prior to 9th September. Property acquired subse- quently may also be transferred if it is proved that it has been acquired through funds of foreign origin. Foreign exchange may be delivered for payment of authorised imports, debts con- tracted prior to Saturday, and for limited travelling expenses abroad. A further decree increases the extra income-tax. drafted on 19th November, 1938.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 10th Sept. Operations in the steel industry are con- fidently expected to rise sharply from now into the autumn, with an 80 per cent. pro- duction rate probable in a month or two owing to heavy orders, domestic and foreign. Steel mills at Pittsburg are scheduled to start this week at 67 per cent. of capacity, a jump of 7 points. Activity in the Chicago steel district this week will be 16 points greater at 64 per cent., and in the Youngstown area 7 points up at 64 per cent. Facing daily growing foreign inquiries, the steel industry is understood to have resolved to prevent dislocation of the markets and charges of profiteering. Steel companies are determined not to permit the export market to dominate the home market, either from the standpoint of prices or precedence of orders. Prices of steel plate have been advanced about $9 per ton from last week's levels; semi-finished products are about $5 dearer. Tinplate prices have been re affirmed for the fourth quarter.

Moreover, that the British and Allied Capture Clause is to be in- cluded in all war risk policies. They also decided to adhere to the current general schedule of war risk rates, which applies to all business outside the Government scheme. The Joint War Risk Rating Committee also stressed that the terms of the \" Water- borne\" Agreement must be strictly ob- served. This agreement limits the cover of the war risk policy on cargo to the period during which the insured goods are on board the ocean-going vessel. It appears that because the Government War Risk Office will cover goods between ship and shore in the United Kingdom for an addi- tional premium of 10s per cent. inquiries have been made as to whether similar cover could be obtained in the open market, but the answer is a firm negative. U.K. OFFICE INSURANCE On Friday the Government War Risk Office announced that it would accept the risk on cargo shipped by French vessels as well as by those under British or neutral flag. This is really only an interpretation of the intention of the scheme, but the announcement seems to have been neces- sary owing to the over-literal interpreta- tion laced on the original announcement of British and neutral steamers only\" by the official mind in the War Risk Office.

   "text_content" : "In the iron and steel industry the outbreak of war has been followed by an extension of Government con- trol which covers the various stages of acquiring raw materials as well as the manufacturing processes and the dis- posal of the finished products. Under the provisions of the defence regtulations the Ministry of Supply has established maximum prices which until October will remain at the cur- rent level. Licenses are required for the acquisition of iron and steel goods and certain raw material, but provision has been made for exemption in favour of certain classes of purchasers. Exemption has been extended to the main classes of priority users, such as Government Departments and pur- chasers requiring goods for Civil Defence purposes and railway, shipbuilding and coal-mining undertakings. BEST USES In co-operation with the Government the steel industry is now engaged in evolving a system of priorities whereby the avail- able supplies of steel can be put to the best use from the national standpoint. This task is facilitated by the fact that for many months before the outbreak of war there has been in existence a system of voluntary priorities to which most sec- tions of the industry adhered. A chief task at the moment is not so much the allocation of supplies between private and Government contracts but the determination of the order of priority for different contracts placed by various Government Departments. As regards normal commercial orders placed before the recent emergency legislation, it is pointed out in steel trade circles that these will be carried out so far as possible with- out recourse to licensing. Interference with delivery is expected only in excep- tional cases where the question of a superior priority occurs. EVEN FLOW OF OUTPUT The nightly black-out is not interfering with the even flow of production, though the necessity for screening lights has im- posed on the leading manufacturing com- panies a not inconsiderable financial burden. Black-out arrangements comprise chiefly the shading of pig-beds and the screening of mills, which require a sub- stantial amount of structural work. In addition, those companies whose works are situated .on the East Coast have takn steps to ensure safety from air attack by camouflaging arrangements. In consequence of the emergency, the British Iron and Steel Federation has decided to discontinue the issue of monthly returns and other statistical services normally rendered. In the present circum- stances it is considered inadvisable to dis- close this information. It is nevertheless expected that production returns will be furnished to the federation and will thus be available for publication retrospectively after the cessation of hostilities.",
