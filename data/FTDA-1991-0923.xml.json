   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor MINISTERS are worried that the government risks a new political crisis over the poll tax in the run up to the next gen- eral election unless the Trea- sury provides up to a further Â£lbn for local authorities. Their concern comes amid further evidence from opinion polls that Mr John Major, the Prime Minister, cannot risk an election before next spring. It coincides also with a tacit admission in Whitehall that separate negotiations over departmental budgets for next year will result in another sub- tantial overshoot in the Trea- sury's overall spending and borrowing limits. The departments of health, education, social security and trmansport have told the Trea- sury they cannot scale back their spending bids without undercutting Mr Major's stated commitment to better public services. The Treasury is expected to be forced to add around Â£5bn to its Â£221bn spending target for 1992-. The level of support for local authorities was fixed in July after negotiatons betweer Mr Michael Heseltine, environ- ment secretary, and Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Mellor agreed to add Â£1.lbn to the exchequer's con- tribution in the 1992.93 sinan- cial year starting next April, taking it to a total of Â£33.1bn. The grant is now being allo- cated. across different council responsibilities - notably edu- cation, social services, policing and fire brigades - before being broken down further into grants for individual councils. Ministers responsible for the different services believe that the settlement significantly underestimated the demands on local authorities. They have warned that unless it is increased, Mr Major will face either cuts in politically sensi- tive services or more sharp increases in poll tax bills. Their irritation has been heightened by reports that Mr Heseltine could have secured more had he fought harder in July. One senior Whitehall offi- cial said that, if pressed to the limit, the Treasury would have contributed Â£1.5bn. The pres- ent settlement provides for an increase of about 4.5 per cent in local authority spending over the present financial year. The Treasury insists that this is realistic if, as it predicts, inflation falls to less than 4 per cent. It argues also that coun- cils could find, as they did this year, another Â£600m from their reserves. The spending departments, whose concern has been inten- sified by the increase in non payment of the poll tax, believe the generous pay awards in prospect for teachers, the police and fire staff underca the calculations. According t one senior minister, at least a additional Â£500m is needed t meet obligations towards thu- groups. In addition, there is growin support within the cabinet ft abolition of the rule that eve the poorest must pay 20 p= cent of the poll tax. This woul be fiercely resisted by the Tre sury because it would co. another Â£400m. Green' campaign, Page 8 Observer, Page 14",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington THE US is preparing to drop its long-standing opposition to the Soviet Union becoming a full member of the Interna- tional Monetary Fund and World Bank. The prospective shift in US policy - which would allow the Soviet authorities to bor- row directly from international financial institutions - reflects a new, optimistic assessment of the Soviet lead- ership's willingness to tackle economic reform. It also stems from a growing realisation in Washington that the IMF - as a neutral body with substantial credit resources - should take the lead role in dealing with a future Soviet economic reform plan rather than the US, facing a budget deficit next year of $345bn (Â£204bn). Senior US officials are more optimistic than before about the prospects for economic, reform in the Soviet Union, with the big qualification being that workable power-sharing and economic agreements need to be reached between the republics, particularly Russia and the Ukraine. The high-level US assess- ment is that the abortive Kremlin coup in August \"wiped out\" earlier opposition to a market economy and that virtually all power has flowed to the republics. \"We are now dealing with a very different country,\" said one Alernatlve pan ............Page 2 senior administration officia 1. Mr James Baker, US secre- tary of state, who visited Moscow two weeks ago, has emerged as the leading advo- cate of a more flexible approach. During talks, he pledged direct economic aid to the Soviet Union on condition there was a \"clear commit- ment\" to economic reform. By extracting several key conces- sions, notably a Soviet pledge to end its military presence in Cuba and a cut-off in aid to Afghanistan, Mr Baker removed political obstacles to future US financial aid. President George Bush has remained cautious on the IMF issue and direct US financial aid, and a final decision may still be several months away. But the emerging consensus among western diplomats and US officials is that Mr Bush will shift - just as he did last month when he pledged large- scale humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union and republics this winter. A key factor is last year's budget agreement with Con- gress which imposes caps on individual spending catego- ries. The White House remains confident that it can absorb the costs of medical and food aid to the Soviet Union within existing targets, but a request for substantial direct aid to support a reform package, pos- sibly as early as next spring, could embarrass the adminis- tration. Senior US officials are there- fore examining seriously a Democratic proposal to trans- ser $ibn from the defence bud- get. The difficulty is that this could unravel the budget accord, since it would involve a transfer of funds from one spending category to another. At the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations before the failed coup, the US proposed \"associate member- ship\" of the IMF for the Soviet Union in a successful effort to halt president Mikhail Gorba- chev's campaign for $20bn of financial aid. Last month Mr John Major, British prime min- ister, persuaded Mr Bush to support accelerated \"associate membership\". The US Treasury has argued that the issue unnecessarily distracts from practical steps such as IMF and World Bank technical assistance. Another concern is the future of the 50 per cent increase in the IMF's resources, currently snarled up in legislation in Congress. The Treasury has argued that full membership of the IMF for the Soviet Union could complicate an already difficult Congressional debate or the nrinta inermf-l.",

   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson and hro Dawnay in London and David Buchan in Brussels I THE Treasury denied yester- day that the government was significantly reducing its oppo. sition to a single European cur- rency in order to gain inclu- sion in the first division of a twotder community. It insisted that parliament should retain a veto on moves towards currency union. \"It remains the UK's position that we cannot accept the imposition of a single cur- rency,\" the Treasury said. Mr Norman Lamnt, the chancel- Ior, had spelt out the Impor- tance of retaining \"national discretion\" over the pound at the weekend meting of EC finance ministers at ApeMoorn in the Netherlands. But at that meeting other EC ministers said the process of healing the rift among them over a twospead move to eco- nomic and monetary union (Emu) had made it harder for the UK to escape a commit- meat to a les currenowy. They i sa in smaes toarld have a soy in moves towards Emu and no institutional barri- er should be erected to lag- gng economies joining the cur- rency union late. Mr Lamont told Tory MPs that no firm commitments had ben made. He rejected the col- lective view that the Emu treaty, due to be signed in December at Maastricht, should now be written to assume that all 12 BC members ill join Emu, with temporary let-outs - known as \"deroa= tions\" - for those states not yet economically fit to do so. He clearly preferrd an ear- Her proposal by the Dutch sealdinyof the EC which put he onus on countries to 0gI il\" to Emu, rather than m= nw formula which will be Mied towards \"opting out\". ibough Mr Lamont is cin- Ing to parliament's right to decide on monetary sover- -ntyx , some obervers yester- day read the meeting as - dence that the UK Is been to be -mog the first wave As cuew tcy irs.

Treasury insiders inter- preted this as a way of ensur- ing that Britain is not being left out of important policy decisions. It Is determined to be one of the countries likely to Institute and staff the cen- tral bank responsible for man- aging buropean monetary pol- icy and the currecy.

Outside Georgia's Supreme Soviet, about 5,000 people pro- claimed their support for Presi- dent Zviad Gamsakhurdia, chanting \"Georgia and Gam- sakhurdia are one\". The focus of the opposition, meanwhile, moved to the head- quarters of Georgian televi- sion, where several thousand people came to the aid of work- ers who have been on strike, refusing to broadcast what they call \"disinformation\" from the government. The strikers, who attracted support from about 100 soldiers of the National Guard, remained defiant late last night despite concessions said to have been made by Presi- dent Gamsakhurdia. According to some reports, he agreed in talks with opposition leaders to an emergency session of parlia- ment to discuss new elections. In front of the television sta- tion stood a barricade of buses and lorries. Hosepipes from a fire engine and the television centre were ready to be used against attackers. Demonstrators on both sides gave a warning of bloodshed after three weeks of mounting tension which began when Continued on Page 16 Soviets developments, Page 2 Georgia close to civil war Ctudm from Pae 1I police broke up a demonstra- tion against Mr Gamsakhurdia. Opposition forces are demand- ing Mr Gamsakhurdia's resig- nation, claiming he is a dicta- tor who has failed to deliver election promises, and is dam- aging Georgia's attempts to gain international recognition of its independence. During the weekend, one person was killed and 33 were injured in fighting in the city. Several thousand govern- ment supporters tried to dis- mantle opposition barricades and then drove the opposition out of the fornner Institute ps Marist-Leninism, forcing it to regroup at the televirion cen- tre The rebels are unable to use the transmitter as Uins have been blocked. Georgian teleiri sion remained in the control of Mr Gamsakhurdia, broadcast ing from a studio in the Supreme Soviet building linked to a television mast. Outside the government building and throughout th- city the strength of Mr Gem- sakhurdia's support was clear. \"He saved us fom Commu- nism, he gave Georgia its ind pendence,\" said one engineer. At the television centre, his opponents were not aftald to compare Mr Gamsakhurd With Stalin, OCnuea or M dam Husein. Mr Geoit Hos taria, the frmer foreign mna ter who resigned three da before Augusts lid coup Moscow - which Mr Gamnk- hudiaiicala d i by his y1q- nents to have supported - said. \"I would not say he is mad, but there is something very strange about him.\" Mr Hoshtaria said it had become impossible to work with Mr Gamsakhurdia, who had changed his political pro- gramme and retused to imple meat privatisation and allow private ownerhtp od land. r Gamahurda, who was elected president in May with 87 per cent of the votes, has a bme cosd Uposem aon iTr ofGeorgian radio and television.

As the largest manufacturer of trucks over 6 tonnes, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to the world around us. With a commit- ment to innovative research and careful design, we aim to ensure a clean and healthy future for all. Mercedes-Benz have long been recognised as leading innovators in vehicle safety. Nearly three decades ago, the dual circuit brakes we Thanks to our research, the road is a safer place. had developed went into production. And in 1981, our anti-lock brakes became available commercially. Our intensive programme of research and development is fundamental to our philosophy. Each year we invest over Â£ 250 million in research in the commercial vehicle sector, combining our concerns for safety, improved efficiency and environmental protection. Take our TOPAS prototype tanker for example. Within this technologically- advanced concept strides have been made in many areas of safety, such as electronic tyre pressure control, differential lock, anti-lock braking and anti-skid control systems (ABS/ASR) - even a rear video camera which makes manoeuvring easier. And in conjunction with associate companies within the Daimler-Benz Group, body builders and our customers, we are actively exploring innovations in automotive technology, environmental protection, and traffic management.

The agreement opens the prospect of two distinct eco- nomic unions emerging, one based in Moscow and a second with headquarters in Tallinn. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's president, is attempting to convene a con- ference of all republic leaders in his capital, Alma Ata, on September 30 to discuss emer- gency economic measures. Soviet President Mikhail Gorb- achev would not be invited. , Thirteen-of the 15 republics participated in the Tallinn meeting, including Russia, although the latter's represen- tative, deputy prime minister Yevgeny Saburov, -disareed with some of the prosals. The Tallinn Process, as the negotiations have been dubbed, reflects growing fear among the non-Russian republics that Mr Boris Yeltsin's White House - the Russian parliament - is as great a threat to their sover- eignty as the Kremlin. Mr Volodymyr Lanovy, Ukraine's minister for privati- sation, said the joint moves were an attempt to prevent Russia from unilaterally taking over former all-Union property. At the weekend Mr Lanovy rejected the Yavlinsky model as \"another effort to force upon us a single financial and mone- tary svstem\". The republics agreed to dis- cuss division of the Soviet Union's foreign debt and gold, diamond and hard currency reserves at their next meeting, in three months. They agreed to negotiate new inter-republic trade con- tracts, but assured the Baltic republics that their supplies would not be cut off this year in retaliation for independence. They also agreed to drop the rouble as the internal trading currency as soon as the repub- lics introduced separate cur- rencies. By contrast, the Yav- linsky plan envisages inter-republic trade being con- ducted in roubles, even after separate currencies emerge. The republics also discussed a Ukraine suggestion to create an interstate clearing-bank, which would establish exchange rates between repub- lican currencies. The Russian delegation favoured instead a single all-Union bank. * Ukraine will be poised to introduce a separate currency by the first quarter of next year. Over the weekend the republic decided to pript bank- notes and to embark on an eco- nomic reform programme which would give them value. Mr Volodymyr Matvienko, chairman of the Ukrainian National Bank, signed a letter of intent with the Canadian Banknote company. According to a company consultant, Mr Orest Nowakisky, Mr Mat- vienko will travel to Ottawa next week to negotiate a deal to print l.Sbn banknotes in Canada and construct a turn- key mint in Ukraine. Canadian Banknote is asking about $2.9m (Â£1.71m) to print the notes and is offering to build the factory as a joint ven- ture, which would recoup its costs by printing money for other republics and nations.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson in Moscow THE inefficient Soviet food distribution system was the first thing on the minds of Mr John Selwyn Gummer, the British agriculture minister, and a team of leading British food industrialists who arrived in Moscow lat night. However, the poor system for distributing visiting dele- gations was the main preoccu- pation of British diplomats to whom the dislocated Soviet and Russian authorities had still not been able to offer an agenda for the 104ay trip. \"We hope they'll come up with something tomorrow,\" said one official hopefully. Another was less sanguine about the coherence of central authority in post-coup Moscow. \"This place is like a corpse,\" he said. \"It's still twitching - bat we can't find the head anywhere.\" Mr Gummer will be less troubled by the disorganisa. tion, if only because he plans to stay in Moscow a little over 20 hours to study food distri- bution systems. He decided only on Thursday to visit Moscow, after talks with Mr Yuri Luzkhov, chief executive of Moscow, who was visiting London. British officials frowned, almost convincingly, on specu- lation that Mr Gummer's sud- den merey-dash to Moscow had more to do with British elec- toral politics than Soviet food supplies. A hasty tour of Moscow shops has been arranged for Mr Gunmmner, and more talks with Mr Luzkhov - if he shows up. \"We think he's in Warsaw, but we hope he may be in Moscow tomorrow and can meet the minister,\" said an official. The eight-member team, led by Mr Ronald Macintosh, head of the British Food Consor- tium, and including the chief executives of some of Britain's biggest food processing and retailing groups, appeared calmly unconcerned by their lack of agenda. One suggested they may now have a better chance of \"avoiding those long meetings in offices with bad interpreters\".",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb THE massive military operation launched late last week by Yugoslavia's Serb- dominated army is aimed at carving out and consolidating a greater Serbia, through a three-pronged offensive, according to senior officials from the republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. To achieve this goal, the army, with the support of Ser- bian paramilitary units, has first to relieve federal military barracks which are being blockaded by Croatia's national guard. It must also complete the mobilisation in Bosnia-Her- cegovina, and move troops and reinforcements across that republic to the Croatian bor- der. Croatian and Bosnian offi- cials believe the federal army, and Serb paramilitary units, supported by President Slobo- dan Milosevic of Serbia, will also try to capture Vukovar The latest military thrust by the Yugoslav army is concentrated on the partly Serb-populated Krajina and Slavonia areas of Croatia (see chart) and the notional corridor linking Serbia to the sea through Bosnia-Hercegovina and Odijek. These two strategi- cally important cities in Slavo- nia, eastern Croatia, have been repeatedly attacked by federal and Serb units over the past fortnight.- If this three-pronged strategy is achieved, the borders of a greater Serbia will be consoli- HUNGARY Vukovar SLOVENIA CCROATIA'V J/B SERBIA I 8ulJOk K * VM)Â®d jtIkAare\"^A | A'lW....rl .... * ~' S Brok maniao * Luka Tuzia (plo0BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA * Spilt0 i * Sarajevo S i RCorridor linking VuglradO ~ Serbia with the sea | Krajpia i^H||^ K Mostar 1 Slavonia dated. However, Croat officials believe the federal army will not be able to sustain this offensive. \"I believe the federal army is disintegrating. It is the last Yugoslav institution,\" said Mr Gojko Susak, Croatia's new defence minister. \"All the fed- eral institutions have' col- lapsed. The army's-onl!4up port is Serbia and Surbin- alists. But even Milo.evia s had to 'call up volunteers. There are many deserters. Young men have gone Into hid- ing. Over 30 federal barracks in Croatia have surrendered. But the army will fight to its last breath. It will be a long strug- gle.\" Croat officials also believe that the army will not be able to capture Vukovar or OsUek, which have populations of 40,000 and 100,000 respectively. Despite the heavy fire-power of the federal army, Mr Susak and Mr Rusir Mahmutceha- jic, the deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said the civilian population, and the republics' own territorial defence units, would do every- thing in their power to stop the creation of a greater Serbia dic- tatorship. Mr Mahmutcebajic yesterday said that throughout the week- end federal army units had moved north from the republic of Montenegro, a loyal sup- porter of Serbia, into Bosnia- Hercegovina. \"On Friday night, 2,000 federal troops were stopped by the people near Caplina, in south-western Her- cegovina, where many Croats Anxious Croats wait for the allclear signal in an underground bomb shelter in Zagreb yesterday live,\" said Mr MahmutcehaJic. \"But then the federal soldiers were transferred in unmarked buses into the republic to join other units.\" The federal army has six bri- gades, or 20,000 troops, sta- tioned in Bosnia-Hercegovina which have now been mobi- lised against the wishes of the republic's presidency. At the same time, the repub- lic's territorial defence units have also been called up to counter any attempt by the federal army to annex parts of the republic to Serbia. \"The potential for civil war is enor- mous,\" said Mr Mahmutceha- jic. Bosnia-Hercegovina's 4.7m population consists of three ethnic groups: Moslems, who make up 43 per cent of the population, Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent.) Mr Mahmutcehajic said the federal army in the republic, which is under the command of General Nikola Uzelac, a Serb, was working closely with local Serb paramilitary units. These units, manned by Bos- nian Serbs, are located around the city of Banja Luka, north of the republic, which is close to the border with Croatia. The federal army yesterday moved troops across the river Drina at Visegrad to join Serb units at Banja Luka. Bosnian officials said these Serb units were determined to use the region north of Banja Luka as the bridgehead for linking parts of Croatia's west- ern Adriatic coast as well as Krajina, the Serbian autono- mous region in the south-west of Croatia, with eastern Croa- tia and the Serbian-controlled province of Vojvodina. \"Mr Veljko Kadiejevic, the federal defence minister, told the presidency of Bosnia-Her- cegovina at the weekend that federal troops are going through our republic to Croa- tia to relieve the army bar- racks,\" said Mr Mahmutceha- jic. \"But I am also sure that the army is being used to com- plete the division of Yugo- slavia. The army is trying to include parts of Bosnia-Her- cegovina in the new greater Serbia. It wants to break the resistance of the republic. We will resist,\" he said. Mr Susak echoed his words. But, both agreed, it will be a long and bloody war.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey IT has been a long week for Dr Danko Velemir Vrdolak. In normal circumstances, he would be working at a hospital in Zagreb. But his sense of patriotism has taken him to the perimeter of the federal barracks of Borongaj, 5km out- side the Croatian capital. For the past eight days Dr Vrdolak, 25, armed with a Kal- ashnikov rifle, has spent his time with a small unit of Croat national guardsmen who have been blockading the barracks. \"I left my job last Friday week. This unit here, and the Cro- atian Party of Rights, [a far. right wing nationalist move- ment] which I joined last week, needed a doctor in case there was fighting. So here I am.\" The unit will not move away until it receive orders from the Croatian Ministry of Defence. \"We will not let the federal army soldiers out of this bar- racks until we are told to do so,\" he said. There are about 500 soldiers inside the barracks. Dr Vrdol- jak said many were aged only 17 or 18. Since September 14 they have received no food or water and have no electricity. \"We cannot lift this block- ade. There are terrorists inside this barracks. There are dan- gerous people in there. They have weapons. However, I think some of the soldiers want to surrender. But their commander will not allow them,\" Dr VrdoUak explained. He said five soldiers had managed last week to escape from the barracks. \"We allowed them to go home. But I heard some shooting in there a few days ago. The commander has not allowed the wounded to leave the barracks. And last Tuesday night it was really awful, we were attacked by sniper fire. It was one of the worst nights in my life.\" Howitzer shells were fired from the barracks yesterday into the national guardsmen. Two were slightly injured; a nearby factory was hit by sniper fire. The Croatian defence minis- try is trying to wear down the resistance and morale, particu- larly among the younger con- scripts, who have not been seen during daylight since the blockade began. During the long, hot days, the Croats switch on loud- speakers at regular intervals. A voice, calling on the federal troops to surrender, blares across the barracks. The troops inside probably know the message by heart: \"The city of Zagreb, which has given you hospitality, pleads to you officers and soldiers to leave the Yugoslav People's Army, whose generals are causing destruction.... \"Do not let the generals use you to protect their privileges. Do not allow your lives to be used for protecting a failed ide- ology and for destruction. Your colleagues in other barracks in Croatia have left and deserted. They are already at home. Do not let blood remain in our words, our lives and our land....\" Dr Vrdoljak, who knows he could easily emigrate with his qualifications - he has a degree from Williams College in Massachusetts and speaks impeccable English - prefers to remain in Croatia and serve the cause. \"We all have the same wish - independence. I think Tudj- man [the president of Croatia] could be much tougher and stronger. That is why I joined the Croatian Party of Rights.\" He expects it will be another long week.",

   "text_content" : "TWO-SPEED Europe is dead. The minority of EC states should be allowed to follow the majority into monetary union. This was the thrust of what finance ministers of the Twelve agreed in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn on Satur- day. Now, even close observers of Europe's great debate over economic and monetary union (Emu) can be forgiven for not spotting the difference. Yet mninisters were virtually unanimous that they had made an important change of tack that will allow an Emu treaty to be signed at the EC summit at Maastricht in December. The fear that the stronger economies of northern Europe would jump into an early Emu, leaving other EC states behind in the monetary cold, has been gnawing at the latter for some time. Ever since, in fact, the last informal meeting of the 12 finance ministers, in May in Luxembourg, when Germany and its immediate northern neighbours started to warn loudly that only those coun- tries whose inflation and bud- get performance converged closely with their own could expect to share a single cur- rency with them. The fear was best put on Sat- urday by Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish finance minister: \"We are opposed to suggestions that the two-speed approach is the likely scenario, as distinct from something that has to be provided for in case of neces- sity\". Mr Miguel Beleza, Portugal's finance minister, asserted: \"We will never speak of two-speed Europe again\", which seems doubtful, but the debate has been transformed by the Apeldoorn consensus on three points: = Convergence. No one dared quarrel with the strict price, interest rate and budget disci- pline criteria which the Dutch presidency (with heavyweight German, French and Britist :acking) says each country must meet before it enters Emu. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, sugared the pill for the south by saying \"there should also be scope for a political judgment\" on whether a country was fit for Emu. Only Mr Carlos Solchaga of Spain stuck his neck out by saying that, while he was sure that his country would be ready by 1997 (the intended date for the final Emu deci sion), the Community should wait two more years in the hope that all 12 could enter Emu at the same time. Mr Wim Kok, Dutch chairman, dis missed this as faint heartedness about the conver gence process by which, already this autumn, 10 EC states have submitted their medium-term plans for collec- tive discussion in Brussels. 0 The transitional institution. The last two holding out Italy and the Commission - for establishing the embryo European Central Bank (ECB) during the transitional second stage of Emu (meant to last through 1994-97) bowed, with good grace, to the majority preference for the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which would simply co-ordi- nate 12 monetary policies, still run by national central banks. The price successfully demanded by Mr Guido Carli, Italian finance minister, was that \"the minute the ECB is born, the EMI dies\". If the EMI were to linger, it wouldbe seen as a semi-permanent home for' \"second division\" countries.' outside Emu. e Decision-making on the final Emu stage. The Commis- sion and the EMI would report on the state of convergence; fnance ministers would recom- mend to an EC summit as to which countries were fit to pro- ceed to Emu; that summit would pronounce whether the time was ripe for an Emu; if so, finance ministers would then take implementing decisions. Until this last stage, individual governments could still opt out. To be inserted somewhere into this procedure is the wide- spread desire for a minimum quorum of countries needed to make an Emu politically and economically viable. A mini- mum of six, as proposed by the Dutch earlier, was thought to be too small. Belgium suggested seven, the UK and some others eight, and Mr Kok ended by agreeing a majority of the Twelve was necessary. For all the UK's clear inten- tion to sign an Emu treaty 10 weeks hence, Mr Norman Lam- ont, its finance minister, left Apeldoorn slightly more uncomfortable than when he arrived. Worried politically more about \"any-speed\" rather than \"two-speed\" moves to Emu, he did not like the Apel- doorn solution of assuming that all 12 will be in Emu, giv- ing laggards special \"deroga- tions\". Mr Delors made it worse by defining these as temporary or transitional arrangements. That implies, complained Mr Lamont, \"our commitment\" to a single currency.",

This fol- lows a series of financial scan- dals that have jolted confi- dence in his government and the business community. Speaking on Irish radio yes- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t terday, Mr Haughey (pictured below) said: \"We don't really have the sort of mechanism they have in other countries for dealing with major serious financial fraud.

Mr Michael Smurfitt, Ireland's leading industrialist and chairman of Ireland's larg- est corporation, Jefferson Smurfitt, last week became enmeshed in the country's lat- est financial controversy involving a IO10m (Â£9.1m) deal to build headquarters for state- owned Telecom Eireann. A row broke out after Mr Smurfitt, who is also chairman of Telecom Eireann, revealed that he holds 10 per cent of United Property Holdings (UPH), which two years ago owned the site on which the new HQ is to be built. UPH bought the site in November 1988 for IE4.5m, and sold it for a reported IE6.4m in August 1989 to a European property consortium, which in turn sold it to Telecom Eireann for I19.4m in May 1990. Plan- ning permission had not been granted to build the HQ at the time of the deal and the future of the project is still uncertain.",

   "text_content" : "Kevin Done examines the European Commission's latest 'compromise' with Japan T \"is a true compromise\", beams Mr Martin Bange- mann, European Commu- nity commissioner for the internal market and industrial policy. \"Some consider it to be pro- tectionist, some consider it to be giving up Europe and show- ing the white flag.\" As one of the main archi- tects of the recent deal between the European Com- mission and the Japanese gov- ernment on the vexed issue of Japanese car sales in the single European market, Mr Bange- mann is happy for the water to remain muddied. Too much clarity would only threaten the hard-worked for compromise. Gatt sensitivities mean it is much less than a signed agree- ment. The deal - Elements of Con- sensus - was \"the result of conversations between the Commission and Japan on motor vehicles,\" said Mr Frans Andriessen, the European com- missioner for external affairs. However, in direct contrast to Elements of Consensus, other previously unpublished documents from the negotia- tions, obtained by the Sinan- cial Times, would justify the title Elements of Disagree- ment. These documents address the central issues of the level of Japanese transplant produc- tion in Europe and what share the European and Japanese motor industries should have in the European market's future growth or, crucially, what share they should have in any decline in demand. Consensus was reached on having a seven-year transition period to the end of 1999, when the EC car market would be fully liberalised. All bilateral restrictions on Japanese vehicle exports will go by the end of 1992. A system for monitoring Jap- anese vehicle exports - to the EC as a whole and to the now- restricted markets: France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the UK - will be introduced based on an assumed EC vehicle mar- ket of 15.1m in 1999 and Japa- nese exports of 1.23m. In 1989 the EC market for cars and light commercial vehicles was 13.94m, with Japa- nese exports of 1.24m. How to put these principles into practice was left unclear, however, as Brussels and Tokyo failed to bridge old dif- ferences. Is there a ceiling on Japanese transplant production in Europe? The UK government, cham- pion of Japanese interests on this issue, publicly insists not. The more protectionist-minded car makers in France and Italy have been left with the impres- sion, privately, that there prob- ably is, while the Commission talks only of \"working assump- tions\" for transplant output. The chief actors.in the deal - Mr Andriessen and Mr Nakao, Japan's minister for international trade and indus- try - have clearly differing views. These are contained outside the main document in an unpublished four-paragraph statement: declarations conclu- sives (version finale). In prac- lice, there is nothing conclu- sive or final about it. Point one is a declaration by Mr Andriessen to Mr Nakac, saying: 0 \"During these negotiations, the Commission has based itself on various working assumptions concerning the automobile market develop ments in the future, including an estimate of 1.2m vehicles\" for the annual sales by 1999 - the end of the transitional period - of European-built Japanese vehicles in the EC. Mr Andriessen adds: \"May 1, in this context, underline the importance which we attach to a constructive co-operation between the two sides in the implementation of the Elements E % -,of Consensus, in THE particular con- EUROPEAN cerning the prin MARKET ciples laid down ,I S in points 10, 11 and 14 thereof.\" These points declare that: * Future levels of Japanese vehicle exports to the EC \"will be adjusted in an equitable manner\" if the trend of demand and forecast demand deviates from the original assumptions. * Japan \"bears in mind the EC's concern\" that EC car- makers' attempts to become internationally competitive would be affected if EC manu facturers \"cannot enjoy the adequate benefit of market growth\" or they face an \"improper decrease\" in produc- tion in a contracting market. * The Japanese government will tell Japanese car-makers about the Commission's \"repeatedly expressed concern that an excessive concentra- lion of sales of their vehicles produced in the EC on specific national markets would cause market disruption\" and would hamper EC car-makers' attempts to become competi- tive. Mr Nakao's reply illustrates that, on the issue of transplant production, there is a dialogue of the deaf. He ignores Mr Andriessen's reference to a production level of 1.2m. His reply says: \"During these negotiations the Japanese side has based itself on the working assumption that the export fig- ure at the end of the transi- tional period is forecast taking into account total demand and the EC manufacturers' supply capacity as a whole. \"Let me call your attention to your commitment in the Ele- ments of Consensus that Japa- nese investment or sales of its products in the Community shall not be restricted,\" he adds. To Mr Yutaka Kume, chief executive ps Nissan Motor and president of the Japan Automc bile Manufacturers' Associa tion, there is no doubt: Japar has not agreed to any limit on the production of Japanese cars in Europe. The figure of 1.2m vehicles for transplant production is \"not a figure we have agreed between Japan and the EC. This is the EC's unilateral, Internal assumption.\" Is there agreement between Brussels and Tokyo on how to share future EC car market growth and decline between the European and Japanese motor industries? Brussels appears to be talking to itself on this point. Brussels seems to have been unhappy with the vagueness of the conditions for the monitor- ing system but was unable to win Japanese agreement to a clearer statement of how it nshould work in practice. It has had to resort to what it calls an Internal Declaration by the Commission - hitherto unpublished - in which it offers its own \"interpreta- tions\", first of how the \"ade- quate benefit of market growth\" should be shared between European and Japa- nese vehicle makers, second of what the \"equitable manner\" should be for \"adjusting\" Japa- rese exports, if the market turns out to be lower than now assumed. On the first point, the Com- mission states that the moni- toring of Japanese vehicle exports will be conducted throughout the transitional period in such a way that Com- munity manufacturers will benefit from one third of the growth of the market, com- pared with its 1990 level. On the second point, the Commission states that, if demand for any one year is forecast in the twice-yearly monitoring meetings to fall below the originally assumed trend, then exports \"will be reduced by 75 per cent of the deviation\". There is no reply by Mr Nakao on this point, and Mr Kume claims to have never heard of such figures.",

The prevailing wisdom on both sides of the Atlantic is that some form of inde- pendent anchor for monetary policy is needed to neutralise the inationary ten- dencies to which both economies appear prone. The policy failures of the 1910s arose, in part, because both countries replaced unpredictable monetary aggre gates as the policy target by informal echange rate trges. By joining the European enchange rate mechanism, te UK has hardened the dchange rate as the tergel of monetary policy, efecively tying Britain's intret and inflation rates to tose of Germany.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Graham in Rome ITALY'S high rate of inflation and unemployment, with a large budget deficit, are placing the economy increas- ingly out of line with the rest of its main industrial partners, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The warning is in the OECD annual survey of Italy, out today, giving a relatively opti- mistic forecast of 2.5 to 3 per cent growth next year, with the current account deficit shrinking to 1 per cent of GDP. But the OECD catalogues a stern challenge. Italy \"has entered the 1990s with one of the EC's highest rates of infla- tion and unemployment, and levels of public debt and bud- get deficits. These imbalances are mutually reinforcing.\" The 1992 budget is to be pres- ented at the end of the month. The survey says a reduction in the exceptional level of public debt is onlj likely if the gov- ernment is serious about cut- ting public expenditure. In 1990, public debt sur- passed the value of GDP for the first time since 1924 (except for the war year of 1943). The gap between Italy's debt/GDP ratio and those ps the other six largest OECD members is now close to a recordi0 percentage points. The survey underlines Italy's burden of heavylinterest payments which can only be palliated by the recent shift from short-term to medium and long-term borrowing. The OECD recognises Italy has progressed in the fiscal field by joining the narrow band of the' European exchange rate mechanism. It also welcomed the govern- ment's commitment to reduce subsidies, privatise and curb transfers, especially pension payments. However, the sur- vey is sceptical of the political will to implement reform. The \"soaring public pay costs\" are of particular con- cern; in 1990 these jumped 15.7 per cent in nominal terms, nearly twice as large as those in the industrial private sector. \"The configuration of stricter pay discipline in the private sectors and the lack of corre- sponding strictures in the pub- lic sector is a matter of con- cern for a country faced with high inflation and a huge bud- get deficit.\" Editorial comment, Page 14"

He matched his bleak prog- nosis with a heavy public hint that he wants to include cuts in mandatory entitlements, such as health care, in a future budget reduction agreement with Congress. Such mandatory spending categories account for two- thirds of the $1,500bn annual budget but are not subject to annual legislative review. Now, however, \"that trillion has to be on the table,\" Mr Darman said, suggesting renewed interest in pressing Congress into a major budget deal after the presidential elec- tion next year. Mr Darman echoed adminis- tration concern that the US economy was not growing rap- idly enough. The recovery had begun last May, but \"the ques- tion is whether it is going to stay up or stay up strongly.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Prows in Washington - THE WORLD BANK'S support for economic reform in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will not involve a diversion of resources from its clients in the Third World, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's new presi- dent, said at a briefing to launch this year's annual report. He said the bank could expand its overall lending because past capital increases had left \"significant head- room\". The bank's statutory lending limit is $152.3bn (Â£90bn), nearly $62bn higher than outstanding loans of $90.6bn. Lending to eastern Europe rose by just over $lbn to $2.9bn in fiscal 1991. Mr Preston said the bank's strategy towards economic reform in the Soviet Union had to be \"reactive\" because it was impossible to predict how pow- ers would be shared and what help would be required. He said the bank had become \"too presidential and hierarchi- cal\". A streamlining of top management announced last week was intended to \"ener- gise and motivate\" staff. He was eliminating the senior vice-president layer of manage- ment in order to give full oper- ational responsibility to vice- presidents heading regional offices. Mr Preston, a former chair- man of J P Morgan, the New Word Bankl IDA lenming by region 1991 ftisl year total $22.7bn Latin America & Caribbean $5.2 bn York bank, said his manage- ment philosophy was to give staff \"all the responsibility they can take, with sensible controls, and hold them accountable\". The bank expects to lend a total of $23bn-$25bn in fiscal 1992, which began on July 1. This compares with total com- mitments of $22.7bn last fiscal year. Figures for new commit- ments, however, greatly over- state the bank's net contribu- tion to development because many old loans are maturing. Net disbursements by the International Bank for Recon- struction (IBRD) - the main division of the bank - were only $2.1bn last year compared with $5.7bn in fiscal 1990. Net disbursements by the Interna- tional Development Associa- tion (IDA) - the unit that makes soft loans to the poorest countries - were $4.3bn com- pared with $8.6bn the previous year. Allowing for repayment of interest, net transfers by IBRD were minus $5.6bn last year, only partially offset by positive net transfers by IDA. Bank officials argue that the bank's overall performance must be judged not just on its lending but on its success in providing advice and technical assistance. The report indicates that the bank is laying greater empha- sis on developing human resources - a theme of this year's World Development Report. Gross lending for edu- cation was $2.2bn in fiscal 1991, having topped $lbn for the first time in fiscal 1990. Lending for population, health and nutri- tion was $1.57bn, having aver- aged $200m a year in the mid- 1980s. Staff figures indicate a growing emphasis on the envi- ronment. The bank's environ- ment department has 106 pro- fessionals and 34 support staff compared with a handful a few years ago. The report shows the bank's financial position remains strong. The ratio of reserves to loans rose to 11.2 per cent from 10.8 per cent. Net income rose 14 per cent to $1.2bn."

He named 17 people to the 60-seat council on Saturday. Most are professionals and businessmen seen as favouring stability rather than faster democratisation. The appoint- ments also mean the pro-de- mocracy group led by the United Democrats of Hong Kong, which won 15 of 18 directly elected seats last week, remains in opposition. Mr Martin Lee, UD leader, called the appointments \"dis- appointing\". His party had given the governor 20 names for consideration, but Mr Lee said Sir David accepted only one of his recommendations. Several leading Hong Kong politicians were reappointed to the council. But Mr Lee said that, as in the past, these would side with the govern- ment on controversial matters. However, Ms Maria Tam, a prominent lawyer and politi- cian, was not re-appointed, after the Liberal Democratic Foundation, a pro-business political party she founded, failed to win a seat in the direct elections. The decision not to reap- point Ms Tam led to specula tion about her position on the executive council, Hong Kong's main decisive body. The UD is now likely to shift its cam- paign for a greater role in gov- erning Hong Kong to the exec- utive council appointments.

Members of the Palestine National Council (PNC) will discuss the critical issue of Pal- estinian participation in the proposed US-Soviet sponsored Middl East peace summit At their last meeting, which led to the proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, members set in motion a pro- cess that would lead to recogni- tion by the PLO of Israel's right to exist within its pre 1967-war frontiers. By recognis- ing pre-1967 Israel they were effectively forswearing their claim to three-quarters of the land they called Palestine. Mr Arafat believed that such a gesture would gain for the PLO the international recogni- tion it had long craved. Three years and one Middle East war later, the Palestinian movement and its leader are more isolated, more bereft of friends, than at any other time since the PLO's foundation in 1964, due partly to the organi- sation's support of Iraq in the Gulf crisis. Even so, world attention will be focused this week on the conference centre where Mr Arafat will lead debate on the issue of the peace summit. Debate will be fierce and there will be those on the PLO's radi- cal wing - such as Mr George Habash and Mr Nayef Hawat- meh, leaders respectively of the Popular Front and Demo- cratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine - who are likely to argue against Palestinian participation on the terms offered by Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, They will be countered by pragmatists from Mr ArBrts mainstream Fatah faction who believe that current US peace efforts offer what may prove to be the last chance for many years of a genuine attempt to solve the Arab-Israel problem. The acute dilemma for Mr Arafat and fellow historic lead- ers of the PLO is whether, by supporting representation at a peace conference by Palestin- ians who are not members of PLO institutions (Israel rejects Mr Yevgeny Primakov, Soviet envoy to the Middle East, descrbed at the weekend the prospects for a conference as uncertain\".

These call for Israeli withdrawal from Arab land, selfdeterminatior for the Palestinians and acknowdge ment of Jerusalem as the capi- tal of a future Palestinian state. The gathering would then leave it up to the PLO's execu- tive coshmittee, in effect its cabinet, to decide whether to agree to Mr Baker's terms for the participation of Palestin- ians from inside the occupied territories as representatives of the national movement. For Mr Arafat, who is used to being centre-stage, it would not be an easy decision to stand aside while a peace con- ference went forward.",

The estimate of Â£21bn for the whole of 1991 compares with Â£15bn on unemployment spending in the fiscal year 1990-91, which included Â£5m on benefit payments, Â£770m in administration and Â£9bn in lost income and indirect taxes and National Insurance contri- butions. On the basis of spending in the year to April 1991 and the forecast rise in unemployment from a current 2.4m to 2.5m by the end of the year, the Unem- ployment Unit estimates that spending will exceed Â£20.7bn in 1991. Referring to the lost taxes and contributions resulting from mass unemployment, Mr Paul Convery, UI spokesman, said: \"Over Â£10bn of govern- ment revenues will be lost in this year alone - a huge drain on the Exchequer at a time when public expenditure is again under pressure and gov- ernment borrowing puts fur- ther strain on the economy.\" Goldman Sachs, the invest- ment house, says unemploy- ment will cost the government Â£2bn in extra benefits. Those, together with increased child benefit, extra money for Brit- ish Rail and public-sector pay awards \"have already exhausted the Â£3.51mbn contin- gency reserve,\" it says. In a pre-election year, the government is unlikely to be \"firm\" in resisting further upward pressures on spending. In its September assessment of the economy Goldman Sachs says the government will,as a result, overshoot its Â£8bn fore- cast for the public-sector bor- rowing requirement by at least Â£2bn.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent EFFORTS BY the government to seize the electoral high ground on. environmental issues suffered a serious set- back yesterday when it ,emerged that plans for a pow- erful new anti-pollution agency have been delayed. As recently as last July, Mr John Major sought to empha- sise his \"green\" credentials by promising the rapid creation of a unified watchdog, merging the responsibilities of the Inspectorate of Pollution with the work of the National Riv- ers Authority (NRA). The prime minister singled out the plan as evidence of the government's determination to build on the work of its comprehensive white paper - This Common Inheritance - published a year ago. The proposal has now been put back indefinitely after insistence by Mr John Gum- mer, the agriculture minister, that at least some of the NRA's anti-pollution responsibilities should be switched to his department. Government business man- agers are also understood to have opposed any legislation on the agency in the coming session on the ground that it might provoke controversy in the approach to an election. Instead of a firm plan, the government is expected to issue a consultation paper next month which will, in effect, postpone a firm decision, prob- ably until after an election. Disclosure of the delay could not come at a worse moment for the government. Mr Mich- ael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is due to issue on Wednesday the first annual \"audit\" on the government's environmental record since the white paper was published last year. The occasion was intended to trumpet the Conservatives' record and outline a new green agenda that would form the core of the party's commit- ments for the election mani- festo. Meanwhile Greenpeace, the environmental group, will today publish a report alleging \"confusion and gross incompe- tence\" by the government in the management of its environ- mental policy."

   "text_content" : "David Owen reviews the Green party conference IT WAS quite a week for the Green party, even by its own unconventional standards. First, it received a plea - which it rejected - not to stand against Liberal Democrat candidates in the general elec- tion. Then it had its political legitimacy solemnly endorsed on television by both Mr Wil- liam Waldegrave, health secre- tary, and Dr David Owen, the former SDP leader. Finally, it backed fundamen- tal internal reforms, designed partly to turn it into a more effective electoral fighting force - after a meandering and occasionally vituperative debate during which the reformists were accused of wanting to set up \"an insu- lated, isolated politburo\". Whether that potentially far-reaching decision will transform the party and help it towards its medium-term goal of becoming a significant force at Westminster remains to be seen. For the moment, it is still the same old faintly anarchic, highly principled, eccentric bunch. As Mr Jonathon Porritt observed at a crowded fringe meeting in a dingy polytechnic lecture hall: \"The idea of tell- ing the Green party what to do is a totally futile one.\" Item: Where else but at a Green party conference would a carrier bag full of organic apples be used as a political instrument? \"Free to all who intend to abstain in the Green 2000 debate [the reform motion],\" said an attached note NEITHER M1ir Jonathon Porritt nor Ms Sara Parkin ia to stand in the forthcom- ng ballot to elect two Green -prty principal speakers. The prty's best-known national figures ruled them- selves out of the contest a t*h autumn conference dre\" to a close In blustery Wol- verhampton. Ms Parkin is considering standing for a seat on the new party executive, how- ever. The two new figureheads - one man, one woman to be elected annually - are likely to be among the six \"front bench\" speakers chosen by the party during the confe- ence. They are: Ms Janet Alty, Mr Mallen Baker, Mr David Fitzpatrick, Ms Jean Lam- bert, Ms Caroline Lucas and Me Jan Clark. It is not clear whether the new structure will be in place In time for a November general election. on Friday night. \"Watch out for the grotty bits.\" By Saturday, that had changed. The new rubric read: \"\"ollowing widespread consul- tation with all sections of the party (in the bar last night) these apples are free to anyone prepared to accept and work within whatever constitution we have after the motion has been discussed.\" Item: Where else would you hear the question: \"I would like to know if I can move a procedural motion while another procedural motion is being debated\"? Item: And where else would an acrimonious debate con- clude with all present holding hands and observing a min- ute's silence? In terms of policy, the con- ference voted for a progressive liberalisation of Britain's immi- gration laws and a comprehen- sive revision of asylum laws, policies and practices. It formally endorsed a \"defensive refence\" policy committing it to unilateral nuclear disarmament. There was little mention of the party's financial difficul- ties, caused chiefly by dwind- ling membership and the write-off of debts. It is budget- ing for a surplus of just Â£562 in its 1991-92 fiscal year. Such lack of resources, cou- pled with the period of re-ad- justment that the agreed re-or- ganisation will inevitably bring in its wake, do not bode well for general election prospects. The party is running at about 2 per cent in the polls. Nevertheless, in a handful of seats the Greens might make a difference, as the Liberal Democrats are clearly aware. They include Richmond and Barnes, a perennial centre- party target, and Ceredigion and Pembroke North. In the latter case, a joint Green/Plaid Cymru candidate seems likely to provide a stiff challenge for Mr Geraint Howells, the sitting Liberal Democrat MP.",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-23",
   "text_content" : "John Griffiths on how tleindustry is reponding to calls to improve vehicle security in the wake of an upsurge in thefts / A RMAKERS may receive a tongue-lash Stoday from Mr &en Baker, the home secretary. He is expected to tell them that they are not doing enough to prevent the vehicles they pro- duce from being taken by thieves and Joyriders. The talks are to take place against the background of mounting concern about the recent spate of deaths and inju- ries caused by youths driving recklessly in stolen cars, which has coincided with an upsurge in \"professional\" car theft. For the vehicle makers, a new urgency was injected into the issue last week when one of the industry's biggest collec- tive customers, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) - repre- senting companies that buy more than 500,000 new cars annually - accused manufac- turers of making \"little prog- ress\" towards a thief-proof car. Mr Roger Macey, the BVRLA's chairman, com- mented: \"As we have seen all too clearly in recent weeks, the theft of cars has become a blight on our society and is the major cause of the continued escalation in crime rate fig ures.\" He was backed up by Mr Freddie Aldous, the BVRLA's vice-chairman, who is also chairman of Swan National, England &WVls. Spain 1c France 8.70 the TSB-owned vehicle leasing and rental group. \"Manufactur- ers have a clear social respon- sibility to ensure that cars, vans and trucks are made as difficult as possible to be used illegally, and action cannot be delayed any longer.\" Home Office statistics show that a car is stolen every two minutes, day and night. A car theft index introduced by the Home Office during National Crime Prevention Week earlier this year showed that some high-performance cars were up to 10 times more likely to be stolen than other cars. Presenting the index, Mr Baker also announced the results of a survey disclosing that 75 per cent of motorists questioned would be prepared to pay up to Â£100 for improved security fitments to a car. The insurance organisations esti mate that motor-related crime is costing more than Â£lbn annually. This week's meeting is also likely to include discussions on a UK frnitiative for the EC to draw up security standards to be applied to all new models produced within the EC. Such measures would include the mandatory fitting of deadlocks and the etching of vehicle iden tification marks on window glass. The Home Office index showed that theft was sharply reduced where some manufac turers - a minority - had themselves already adopted such measures. The Home Office's theft index showed that five of the seven cars in the \"very high risk\" category - where 15 per cent of the total were stolen - were high-performance Fords. Aow-risk cars, involving fewer than. 1 per cent being stolen, ranged from Mercedes Benz models to Ford's Anglia, last produced in the 1970s. The increase looks likely to have a growing impact on the financial burden both busi- nesses and private motorists will have to bear in the form of increased insurance premiums. The number of cars stolen in the first six months of this year has increased by more than a third compared with a Vear ago, according to the urance group, Commercial Union, resulting in a 68 per cent increase in the cost of pay-outs. Nearly 1m motorists insured by Norwich Union face being made to pay the first Â£100 towards claims made after next month if they do not keep their vehicles in a locked garage. The Institute of Insurance Brokers is also supporting the principles behind a policy underwritten by Dominion Insurance, the terms of which provide for no pay-out if it is established that a stolen car had been left unlocked. Not surprisingly, some man- ufacturers who have taken ini- tiatives to improve security feel that they are being exces- sively pilloried, given the find- ings of a survey by the Auto- mobile Association. It found that 70 per cent of surveyed cars had no alarm fitted, 20 per cent had valuables on view and 10 per cent had been left unlocked. Seeking to improve the pic- ture, the BVRIA in 1988 instituted an annual anti- theft award. Vauxhall won in 1988, 1989 and this year. No award was made in 1990 because the BVRLA felt that no manufacturers had made any significant advances. Vauxhall stands out, according to Mr Aldous, \"because it is the first volume manufacturer to look seriously at car security.\" Ford, the UK market leader, whose cars have proved the most attractive, in volume terms, to thieves and joyriders, has stepped up its anti-theft programmes, with factory- fitted alarms now standard on Scorpios, Granadas, Sierras and Orions. All manufacturers, however, say they doubt whether it will ever be possible to come up with a foolproof anti-theft sys- tem, faced with professional thieves who steal cars to order. High technology may eventu- ally provide an answer. Securi- cor, for example, employs a system using a tracking unit aboard a vehicle, allowing a central control to establish where the vehicle is at any time. Car manufacturers and police forces have begun to examine similar systems as a theft-prevention measure. Not quite so futuristic is the Invisibeam system produced by Gamma Electronics, which detects the presence of a possi- ble thief lingering near the car and issues a warning via voice synthesiser. If the presumed thief is undeterred, the next warning is that the alarm is about to go off, followed by a countdown. Vauxhall executives, in par- ticular, are unlikely to take a tongue-lashing from Mr Baker lying down. They are likely to argue that a considerable obli- gation rests on the government and public to take measures within their own respective powers to curb thieves and joy- riders. A basic obstacle, Vauxhall said at the weekend, is that those outside the industry can- not believe that it is beyond the ingenuity of manufacturers to devise a foolproof system, and suspect instead that the industry is simply not pre- pared to spend enough money on doing it. Vauxhall com- ments: \"Everything that has been come up with so far, thieves have found an answer to.\""

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy MR KENNETH BAKER, the home secretary, is prepared to consider practical suggestions that might improve the work- ings of the commercial broad casting industry after the com- petitive tendering process for ITV licences is completed. At the convention of the Royal Television Society in Cambridge, he mounted a robust defence of the competi- tive tendering system. Mr Baker said the process had pro- duced leaner and more effi- cient television companies without any loss of quality on the screen. The process will lead several ITV companies to lose their franchises, and to an increase of up to Â£300m a year in reve- nue for the Treasury from the -TV system. Once the winners and losers are announced in the second half of next month, however, Mr Baker will consider whether any loose ends have been left. It is not yet clear whether the government would take seriously any changes that would require legislation. Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission (ITC), made clear at Cambridge that he would be approaching the government with \"a shopping list\" after the new 10-year licences were awarded. At the top of the list would be the government's insistence in the 1990 Broadcasting Act that Independent Television News (ITN) must sell a major- ity stake to outside investors by 1994. The ITC accepts that outside investors would be a good idea for ITN, but does not believe they should have control. \"We believe that ITN should be controlled by the people wno are its principal custom- ers\", Mr Glencross said. Those principal customers are the LORD Young, the former trade and industry secretary, attacked BBC Radio 3, the classical music station, as an indulgence that should be abolished. Speaking at the conven- tion of the Royal Television Society in Cambridge, he said the licence fee, which funds BBC broadcasting, should be cut to Â£50 from Â£77 for a colour television by the end of the century. ITV companies that now own 100 per cent of ITN. The real worry of the ITV companies is that there might be a conflict of interest between broadcasting and non- broadcasting shareholders on the cost of covering expensive events, such as the Gulf war. They fear that companies seek- ing return on their investment might overrule the news judg- ments and needs of broadcast- ers. An amendment to the broad- casting act would be required to enable broadcasters to retain control of ITN. Also at Cambridge, Mr Mich- ael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, spelled out his per- sonal vision for the corporation in the period before negotia- tions over the renewal of its Royal Charter, which runs out in 1996. Mr Checkland said the BBC would test the efficiency of its services against the best prac- tices in the outside market. He was determined that \"univer- sality\" - ensuring a service available to the entire popula- tion - would endure. The debate on the future of the BBC should first concen- trate on what the corporation's purpose should be and what programme services were required before addressing how they should be funded, Mr Checkland argued.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor CAPITAL goods companies will benefit more from the recovery than consumer- related Industries because of their ability to reduce labour costs, according to a report from UBS Phillips & Drew, the stockbrokers. Consumer groups have tended to lead the economy out of recession, with growth in capital-goods expenditure following later. The report argues that cor- porate profits may rise sub- stantially although growth of less than 1 per cent is expec- ted. That is because job losses, linked to pay deal moderation, will reduce unit labour cost inflation - and thus provide a stimulus to profit margins. The report says that compa- nies with the highest ratio of labour costs to trading profits will benefit most. Among capi- tal goods companies, which produce equipment sold to the corporate sector, rather than to the consumer, those with the greatest potential to improve profits are in elec- tronics and engineering. The least such potential is in the motor and building sectors.",

   "text_content" : "By John Plender PLANS BY Lucas Industries to claw back Â£90m from a surplus in the Lucas pension scheme have met an unexpected chal- lenge from a former trustee. Mr Simon O'Leary, a retired employee of the motor compo- nent and aerospace group, has written to the Occupational Pensions Board (OPB) attack- ing the basis of the proposi- tion. The board is required by the government to sanction any transfer of pension-fund surpluses to the company, Mr O'Leary, a union repre- sentative who sat on the Lucas Staff Pension Fund trustee board for 14 years, has alleged a breach of trust by the fund's trustees. He is threatening to take legal action if the OPB sanc- tions the transfer, which would cost the pension fund Â£150m before a tax payment of Â£60m to the Inland Revenue. The proposed modifications to the Lucas pension scheme trust deeds, which have won union approval on the basis of an accompanying improvement in employee benefits, are due to be considered by an OPB committee on Wednesday. Approval would normally require the committee to be satisfied that the company's claim to the pension-fund surplus was balanced by a genuine promise to meet any pension-fund deficits. Mr O'Leary's letter to the OPB, of which the Financial Times has a copy, alleges that the late Sir Bernard Scott, the former Lucas chairman, told trustees that the company would not finance any shortfall in the pension fund. The letter adds that Sir Bernard, who was also chairman of the pension- fund trustees, said: \"In the event of a shortfall, some solu- tion other than extra money from the company would have to be found.\" The attitude was reiterated several years later, according to the letter, by a director who was also a trustee. Lucas Industries has con- firmed that although the com- pany has made additional pay- ments into the fund to finance improved benefits, it has never put in money to meet deficits. The company added that the trustees had taken indepen- dent legal advice from that taken by the company on the proposed changes to the trust deed. Mr O'Leary is calling for the Lucas pension-scheme surplus to be used to increase benefits to the maximum level permit- ted by the Inland Revenue. He also argues to the OPB that it is imprudent for Â£150m of the fund's surplus to be removed while the implications of the recent European Court of Justice ruling in Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange remain unclear. The ruling calls for the equalisation of male and female retirement ages without indicating how that should be achieved. Lucas's proposed move to extract money from the pen- sion fund follows the accumu- lation of a substantial surplus in the 1980s.",

   "text_content" : "By David Churchill SALARIES of some head teachers need to rise by up to 20 per cent to match equivalent pay in the private sector, according to a study by Hay Management Consultants. The research was commis- sioned by the National Assocla- EMPLOYMENT tion of Head Teachers, which plans to submit it to the new independent pay review body for teachers in England and Wales. The review body is due to make its first report in Janu- ary for implementation in April. Last week Sir Graham Day, chairman of Rover, was appointed to chair the new board, a decision that was crit- icised by both employers and unions. The Hay research into head teachers' pay takes account of their increased budgetary responsibilities in the running of schools. A head of a 1,500-pupil sec- ondary school, for example, with a budget of up to Â£2.5m a year, would receive Â£43,000 if paid the same as managers in industry or commerce, Hay says. Heads of large primary schools, with budgets of about Â£500,000, would be paid Â£30,200, while heads of small primary schools would get Â£25,800. Mr David Hart, general sec- retary of the association, said yesterday the study was under- taken because \"while thou- sands of words have been writ- ten about the substantial increase in responsibilities for senior management in schools, no one has previously accu- rately assessed the salary implications for heads and dep- uties\". * The standard of basic edu- cation of school leavers apply- ing for jobs was criticised in a survey published yesterday by the British Institute of Manage- ment. More than 90 per cent of the 500 managers surveyed said that the basic skills of appli- cants, such as mathematics, reading, grammar and spelling, were generally unsatisfactory.",

   "text_content" : "By Usa Wood, Labour Staff A CAMPAIGN is growing to change the contractual rela- tionship between Britain's pro- viders and purchasers of train- ing, according to Community Industry, the Cheshire-based provider of training for young people and unemployed adults. Last month Community Industry was one of 15 non- profit-making training organi- sations that expressed criti- cism of contracts between pro- viders and the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales and 22 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) in Scotland. Among the main criticisms identified in the report pre- pared by the 15 organisations, called the Bridge Group, were the short duration of contracts (a maximum of 12 months) and clauses that allow Tecs and Lees to terminate contracts early. Tecs can technically negotiate longer contracts with training providers, but because the government gives them money only on an annual basis they must bear any risk. Mr John Plummer, group managing director of Commu- nity Industry, said that, since circulating the report, he had received dozens of letters from industry chairmen and chief executives sharing the con- cerns of the Bridge Group to secure commercially sound contracts. Respondents had included Mr Tony Cleaver, IBM chair- man and chief executive, and Sir David Nickson, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, an umbrella body for Lecs. Sir David had said that the report would make a positive contri- bution to the further consider- ation of relationships between Lees and training providers. Mr Plummer said the issue of contracts was \"make or break\" for training. The gov- ernment, he said, had claimed that Tecs were free to negoti- ate individual contractual arrangements with providers. Mr Plummer, rejecting the gov- ernment's claim, said: \"They can only negotiate with their suppliers contractual terms which are within the limits of their contracts with the Employment Department.\"",

   "text_content" : "Alan Pike reports on West Berksbire's plans to hand over non-medical support services to the private sector B y next spring, West Berkshire district health authority plans to have handed over the management of large parts of its non-medical support ser- vices to the private sector. The move is being watched with fascination by managers else- where in the National Health Service, and with apprehension by some of West Berkshire's own managers and union rep- resentatives. Competitive tendering for services is commonplace in today's health service, and other forms of commercial activity are growing - in some hospitals the traditional stall run by volunteers from the league of friends has given way to swish, privately-managed shopping malls. But most commercial involvement is for single ser- vices and West Berkshire's \"facilities management\" pro- posals are the most extensive ever attempted in the NHS. West Berkshire originally considered asking the private sector to take over the provi- sion and management of its entire range of general support services - a vast package of activities ranging from cater- ing and portering to building maintenance and clerical.and secretarial functions. When the idea was mooted, the authority's own hospital managers argued that those support services which came into direct contact with patients, like cleaning and por- tering, should remain under in-house control. They will - provided the in-house teams deliver the same level of efficiency improvements as the authority expects to obtain from the facilities management exercise. Estate management, waste disposal, laundry and linen, sterile supplies, non-ambulance transport and a new cook-chill catering unit which will supply hospitals in West Berkshire and the neighbouring East Berkshire and Wycombe health authorities now form the basis of the proposed facilities man- agement contract. After considering bids from a range of organisations with rel- evant experience, the authority entered into negotiations with P&O Total Facilities Manage- ment, part of the shipping group. Most of the details are com- plete, and a recommendation to go ahead with the scheme is likely to be considered by the health authority at its Novem- ber meeting. P&O would appoint an over- all manager to run the pro- posed five-year contract, who Clean break: privatlsation plans Include the laundry at Battle Hospital in Reading would be supported by a team of about half a dozen execu- tives in charge of areas includ- ing personnel, accounts, house services, engineering and building maintenance. Robin Booker, P&O Total Facilities Management's managing direc- tor, says that at least some of these senior positions would be filled by existing NHS manag- ers working for West Berkshire - which covers the Reading area - or other authorities. \"Our top managers would need NHS experience. We must have people who understand what the business is all about.\" P&O, itself, through its own catering and other subsid- iaries, might operate some of the services it will be manag- ing. Others would be con- tracted to other companies, or new small businesses formed by groups of existing health authority employees. \"It might turn out that we had only 20 or 30 people directly employed, with every- one else working for contrac- tors. Alternatively, we might employ more,\" says Booker. \"Pay rates and conditions for staff would be negotiated by the contractor providing the service. But we would not sub- contract to anyone who failed to offer reasonable terms and conditions.\" In spite of this assurance, the plan has not found favour with unions representing the health authority's employees. They fear that there will be a loss of jobs and a decline in both the quality of services and conditions of employment. Hundreds of the health authority's staff are likely to be made redundant under the move to the facilities manage- ment contract. Since unem- ployment in the Reading area remains relatively low, many are likely to be re-employed by the contractors. For some indi- viduals, this will compensate for the loss of security. The health authority hopes that the contract with P&O, if finalised, will save at least Â£500,000 a year, and that effi- ciency imrp-ovements in the services remaining in-house will yield similar savings from a Â£16m general support ser- vices budget. In a bid to deliver their share of the savings, the in-house teams are likely to consider developing generic working among support staff - the \"porters who also change light bulbs\" approach. P & 0 would provide its ser: vices for a fixed fee rather than taking a share in the savings, and both the company and the health authority believe the eventual financial gain may be greater than the target Â£500,000. Some of the contracted-out services, like laundry, contain potential for income genera- tion through taking on non- NHS work. Kevan Jones, the health authority's director of person- nel and administration, expects that P&O's managers will also find opportunities for cost-sav- ing rationalisation - for exam- ple, the authority currently has three departments respon- sible for estate management. \"We are plannlig to intro- duce facilities management because we are in the business of providing health care,\" he says. \"This means that we must get maximum value for money to invest in patient care and concentrate our manage- ment skills where they are most needed. \"For instance, the authority owns more than 400 residential properties for staff and we employ our own workforce to maintain them. We have to ask ourselves whether it is right that a health authority should be devoting resources to man- aging hojses. Just because things have been done in a cer- tain way since the NHS was formed in 1948 does not mean it is necessarily the best way to carry on.\" This question is more than one of managerial philosophy. Health authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to attract good specialist manag- ers to some of their non-core activities, where career devel- opment opportunities are inevi- tably more limited than in mainstream health care man- agement. West Berkshire plans to set up a consortium management board, consisting of health authority members and manag- ers and representatives of P&O and the in-house teams, which will review the performance of all contracts, monitor customer attitudes and take remedial action if problems arise. It does not intend to follow the conventional competitive tendering formula of producing highly detailed contract specifi- cations. Michael Taylor, the health authority's district general manager, says the companies consulted on the facilities man- agement plan were disen- chanted - along with many health authorities - by the bureaucracy associated with the NHS's traditional competi- tive tendering process. \"Market leaders have refused invita- tions to tender for services which they perceive as unreal- istic in complexity and wholly motivated to drive down costs.\" West Berkshire hopes that it has found a more realistic way of introducing commercial dis- ciplines into the NHS. The scheme will not start before next year but, in the more commercial atmosphere gener- ated by this year's NHS reforms, West Berkshire is already receiving visits from managers in other health authorities engaged on the same quest for improved sinan- cial efficiency.",

   "text_content" : "I Tim Lawrence on corporate methods of outwitting kidnappers Last month's spate of kid- nappings involving employees from Thomas Cook, Tesco and the Post Office has considerably \"sharp- ened companies' minds to the risks of hostage-taking,\" according to Ray Anning, chairman of Securicor Consul- tancy. Securicor itself had its own mind sharpened when the wife of one of its drivers was taken hostage in Essex last December and the kidnappers forced the husband to hand over more than Â£2m. \"Criminals have always got a market lead, and we never know what the competition is up to until it makes a hostile bid,\" says Mike Hoare, a con- sultant. \"Hostage-taking is the latest method to have evolved among the criminal frater- nity.\" Now that senior executives are receiving high-level protec- tion, company buildings are covered by closed-circuit televi- sion and safes are impossible to pick and immune to explo- sives, criminals have devised new ways of getting access to cash. They have found that tar- geting a manager who has access to large amounts of money, and subsequently kid- napping his family until a ran- som is paid, is one way of get- ting round security procedures. Gerry Mars, a specialist in management and criminology at the Cranfield School of Man- agement, predicts there will be an outbreak of imitations. \"You start off with somebody having an idea and if it works, the method becomes more rou- tine and there is a growth in activity.\" According to Kelvin Hard, a consultant in organisation and human resources at Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, \"there is cer- tainly a degree of panic in mid- dle management about the increase in hostage-taking and at higher corporate levels there is recognition of the need to review procedures,\" he says. Companies which handle large amounts of money should identify which employees are most at risk from kidnapping, according to security consul- tants. They should reassess their cash-handling methods to minimise both the number of people at risk and the degree of risk they face. Procedures to minimise risks at work include: non-accessible cash deposits; more frequent cash collections; a dual key arrangement whereby two keys carried by two people are needed to gain access to cash; and a time-overlock system, whereby the safe is automati cally locked outside business hours. At home, locks, alarms and exterior lighting can be used to deter kidnappers and families should be on their guard when answering the door and answering strange telephone calls. A secure room with an independent means of commu- nication such as a cellular tele- phone could provide a valuable refuge. Vehicles should be protected by installing computerised tracking systems, which can locate a vehicle to within 100 metres and noiseless alarms connected to the police. Routes should be varied regularly. Families - especially wives and children who are likely to suffer particularly from the trauma - should be briefed about the risks of kidnapping and the terror tactics the hos tage-takers are likely to employ. If the victims under- stand the kidnappers' mental- ity they are less likely to be terrified and will be able to defuse the tension by meeting the kidnappers' demands. owever, the introduc- tion of these security measures can cause further problems, according to Hoare, because the more employees are protected, the greater the danger they could be in. For instance, when a time- lock device is in use, \"if the' kidnapper can get the vehicle off the road for long enough then the time lock will come off. All you could be doing is to make the kidnap last longer,\" says Hoare. Also, while educa- tional seminars for families and advice to drivers to vary their routes costs relatively lit- tie, sophisticated equipment. such as alarms, is much more expensive. As a result of the incident involving one of its drivers last iecember, Securicor showed a training video to all its employ- ees about what could happen and what their reaction should be. Mike Waller of Securicor Consultancy admits that while alarms are installed in the homes of the company's senior executives, the cost of provid- ing similar protection for Securicor's 40,000 employees would be \"astronomical\". Companies will have to con- sider a range of factors before deciding whether the risk of a kidnap outweighs the cost of effective security, according to Philip Topping, director of the Centre for Risk Management at Cranfield. These factors include the likelihood of the victim suffering long-term trauma, what effect any kidnap would have on a company's efficiency, including the knock-on effects of any period of absence, and the ransom itself. There is also a possibility that this ransom might take the form of industrial espio- nage - especially with infor- mation technology companies, where the pace of product change is frenetic and the need to keep up with competitors imperative. Loss of image must also be taken into consideration, says Topping. Kidnappings of employees in companies which build their reputation on secu- rity such as banks, building societies and security compa- nies could undermine public confidence. Mars believes that compa- nies will only adopt preventa- tive measures when it becomes economic to do so. So far there have not been enough kidnap- pings to convince companies to take sufficient action, he says. There is one final dilemma for companies to confront. If you collaborate with a hostage- taker once then he could well return a second time. Simon Adamsdale, a security consul- tant at Control Risks, says that \"the prospect of successful law enforcement action, in the interests of removing the threat, is extremely important. However, the process of identi- fying and capturing the kid- nappers has implications for the family involved. In this context, adequate preparation and training, of staff and employers, is also important.\" Nevertheless, three people have been charged in connec- tion with the kidnapping of the Tesco manager and Hard notes that there is generally a high detection rate for kidnappings. Ian Johnson, another consul- tant, is equally optimistic. \"These things need not go on that long. It is not as though we are in Sicily or Lebanon, where kidnappings have been going on since the year dot.\"",

   "text_content" : "J.P. Morean's new HO on the Embankment: the old City of London boys' school B anking nowadays is very much a mat- ter of appearances. Invisible earnings need visible surroundings and when a bank of the quality and prestige of J.P. Morgan opens an important new London head- quarters, it is both a banking and architectural event. Morgan took the unusual course of buying a prominent listed building on the Victoria Embankment with sufficient adjoining sites for a large new office facility. The listed building, the old City of London School, was vacated in July 1986 when the City built new school prem- ises further downstream in Queen Victoria Street, and is a key landmark on the riverside by Blackfriars Bridge. It was built in 1881-2 to the designs of archi- tects David and Emmanuel. It is a giant two-sto- rey Portland stone building with twin columned turrets and a high central spire on the apex of a steeply pitched slate roof. There are five great arches carried on a double order of coupled columns; the great windows are recessed behind these arches and they light the enormous school hall - a space of intimidating grandeur. Only the headmaster, the sixth form and the prefects were allowed to use the main entrance on the Embankment. Morgan intends to continue this tradition, only using the riverside entrance for ceremonial occasions. The new entrance to the bank is to the west side on John Carpenter Street and it marks the link between the old and new. The whole proj- ect, masterminded by the Building Design Part- nership, comprises two separate new blocks, known as the Main and the Island buildings. The Main building is a six-storey granite faced block - almost gigantic is scale. The much smaller neighbouring new building looks like a mere puppy alongside. The whole neighbourhood between Fleet Street and the Thames is part of the Whitefrairs Conservation Area, which a mere pedestrian may find hard to believe as he walks past solid phalanxes of new office buildings. There are a few Edwardian neighbours in blushing brick, but the density of new commercial palaces sug- gests a latter day Florence rather than an inti- mate jumble of City streets. Down Dorset Rise you see only new buildings and a view across the river of the hideous headquarters of Sea Containers. The long side views of Morgan's building con- tinues the impression of a Florentine palazzo with a large overhanging cornice. The architects describe the approach as \"being disposed toward the principles of classicism\". Because of the tight grid-like nature of the surrounding streets the passer-by receives only oblique views of the facades. The long west facade is both classical and evocative of the formal organisation of the spaces within. The whole elevation is controlled by a giant Doric entablature with the trading floor occupying the piano nobile supported by a rusticated base that carries a Tuscan entabla- ture. It is the familiar language of bank build- ings of the 20th century - using classicism to evoke dignified associations and a sense of integrity. At the important corners of the build- ings away from the river, rusticated towers are topped by Soanian pergolas. The strong entabla- ture of the whole building is marked, not by elaborate traditional stone detailing, but by metal supports for a projecting metal frieze that is in fact a maintenance walkway. The architecture is deceptive. There is more than a suggestion in both the rough and smooth granite of solidly hewn walls. But it is an illu- sion. The walls are prefabricated panels hung on a steel frame. If you look at or feel the building carefully there are soft mastic joints and a sense of the thinness of the materials. The inevitable visibility of ventilation louvres confounds any image of a Clyclopian palace. Inside the new building there is nothing that can outshine the powerful presence of the for mer school hall. It is now beautifully restored and approached by the old grand marble stairs past sculpture and inscribed plaques of schol arly history. Mosaic floors, mahogany and wal nut woodwork are now gleaming; fireplaces and stained glass windows have been cleaned and repaired. The hall itself is 60ft high and the huge timber roof recedes into darkness. School- boys who were brought to their terrified knees at morning prayers by the sheer scale of the space have been replaced by conferring bankers and traders whispering more materially focused prayers. Inevitably the decorative richness of the old building throws into relief the functional and basic nature of the interior of the new offices and trading floor. It can be no coincidence that the Morgan executive who showed me round referred to the new building as \"the factory.\" The huge trading floor with its advanced tech- nology of screens and raised service floor repre- sents the last word in banking and communica- tions technology. Some 280 traders spend their days enjoying an almost school-like sense of cameraderie - more officially described as \"management synergy\". Technology is not celebrated as it is at Lloyd's City headquarters - instead it is somehow sup- pressed into a rather grey world of underground rooms, artificially lit spaces and flickering screens. Much of the pressure to put the tech- nology underground comes from the planning demands of the St. Paul's heights regulations - which are the main factor determining the low profile of this well tailored palace of commerce. Morgan's classical suit of outdoor clothes is an appropriate dress - for a sober and polished institution. ColiF Amery",

   "text_content" : "mCl & RADIO a BBC2's big music package on Saturday evening afforded a double <salute to Michael fTppett: the film specially cre- ated for television of the latest Tlppett opera, New Year, preceded by an hour- long composer portrait entitled Sowgs of Experince (made at the time of the work's 1989 Houston premiere). The New Year relay, simultaneously offered on radio, used the forces of the 1990 Glyndebourne run cast led by Helen Field (Jo-Ann), Krister St Hill (Donny) and Kim Begley (Pelegrin) plus the LPO and Glyndebourne Chorus con- ducted by Andrew Davis. Musically at least, the perfdrmance was of enormous distinction: one noted with satisfaction and pleasure how nat- urally Tippett's vocal lines (angularly contorted, heraldically trumpet-like or sweetly coloratura-flourishing as the situation demands) were now sitting on all the voices, how confidently and eas- ily all the cast were dealing with the thornier passages of Tippettian verbal clich. Had this been a radio relay alone, the lover of this whacky, wonderfully origi- nal operatic fantasy would have had only grounds for rejoicing. The difficul- ties came in with the film aspects. They should and need not have, since Tip- pett's operatic visions have been trans- ferred to the small screen with bold success in the past one recalls with particular admiration Nicholas Hytner's film of King Priam and Elijah Mosh- insky's of The Midsummer Marriage, both for Channel 4. Moreover, New Year is almost a product of television: almost all its influences, from the impressions of brutalised modern city life to the sci-fi images, were directly gleaned from the composer's nightly habit of watching the box. But something seems to have gone seriously wrong with the adaptation and transfer process as undertaken by the film's joint directors Dennis Marks (BBC TV's Head of Music Programmes) and the American choreographer Bill T. Jones. What worked in the theatre as a miraculous melange of sounds and influences, daftly naive, comic, poetic and radiant by turns, came across on screen as dramatically queasy, turgid, and dangerously half-baked. The fail- ures lay in design and direction: reli- ance for the moments when the future (Nowhere Tomorrow) arrives by space- ship to visit the present (Somewhere Today) on pop-video graphics so taw- drily second-hand that one gawped at the cheap-and-nasty ghastliness of it all. (If, as reputed, this production cost Â£lm to make, that in itself is a sort of miracle.) Equally saddening was the failure to come to real artistic grips with the colli- sion of worlds that forms the opera's central dramatic crux. The basic studio set seemed designed to frustrate the big crowd scene demanded by the New Year revels of Act 2, since the metallic walkways in which the opera was penned gave no sense of any longer city perspectives. The close-ups of the sing- ers (and their make-up) were uncom- fortably judged, the characters saddled with nightmarishly awful costumes. One remembered with increasing long- ing the snatches of the Peter Hall stage production shown during Songs of Experience: how much more fully that captured the multi-perspective oddities of Tippett's invention, how much better it looked (even if only briefly glimpsed) as film! I cannot swear that the innocent viewer who chanced upon this showing will have been put off Tippett opera for life. What I do insist, however, is that it represents an opportunity badly botched.

   "text_content" : "Hamlet is a very Japanese play. It is not just the formality of the court, nor all those corpses that litter the stage at the end. There is also the search to dentify the corruption that goes with omething indefinably rotten in the state of Denmark. Ophelia, too, strikes one as a Japanese figure as she strews flowers on the way to her watery death. The drama and the imagery are all of a piece. Having said that, however, Hamlet in Japanese is still pretty hard-going for those who do not understand the lan- guage. This Kabuki production at the Mermaid, part of the Japan Festival in Britain, relies heavily on text. Know- JIg the Shakespeare play inside out does not necessarily remove the diffi- culties. For this is not, nor is it intended to be, a straight translation. There are some notable omissions among the minor characters, for exam- ple, and when you have the same actor (Somegoro Ichikawa) playing Hamlet, Ophelia and Fortinbras, you are not easily on recognisable territory. The combining of roles also means that some notable scenes are omitted alto- gether: Hamlet chiding Ophelia, for instance, and there is a rather clumsy body change to allow Fortinbras to come in at the end. Nor is it enough to think that if you have seen a few Kabuki productions before, you can rely on enjoying the visual side, the style and the music. \"his Hamlet is too deep for that. By the end of the first half you may be won- dering what you let yourself in for. It is in the second half that, at least for a British audience, the production begins to shine. The reason may be that that is when the action starts to happen: certainly the stage effects come into their own. The king con- fesses his guilt, but admits that he can- I I Mg I not give up the prie. A wonderful will o' the wisp light is dangled in front of him. Ophella goes mad. That is a natu ral for the Japanese style. The killin of Polonius fits in very well: no more than a wretched rash intruding fool. Polonius here is very much a com- imoner, not even made up in imperial style. True, not all that much seems to -I made of the gravediggers' scene: the graveyard jokes seem to be lacking. Laertes does not Jump in. But when you get to the final duel scene, the suicides and the killings, it is Japan all the way. Hamlet actually kills the king - in a move that made me turn my face away in horror - with a Japanese =word through the mouth. The formality of the court has been well done throughout. It is at its height in the duel, which seems an almost natural and inevitable end, Possibly the production then dwells a shade too long on Fortinbras taking over. I rather preferred the recent Romanian production where the new king, as a man of power, was automatically seen as a villain, just like those who had one before. Still, that is a small matter. The for- mality is helped by the use of screens which half-conceal the musicians and give the additional atmosphere of a court where everyone watches every- one. Should you see it? Yes, if only out of curiosity and a willingness to learn. Appreciation grows as the play goes on. One looks forward to Lear which, you could also say, is a very Japanese play, and also to Falstaff. What on earth will the Tokyo Globe make of that? Those productions follow in the next few weeks.

   "text_content" : "The first production of the new opera season at Geneva, mysteriously announced as Wagner's Le Vaisseau fant6me, was in fact The Flying Dutch man in the original German. It was played straight through without inter- val, an arrangement which should make the whole work resemble an extended ballad with Senta's actual bal- lad in the middle as the kernel - an effect for various reasons not wholly achieved on this occasion. Clearly producer Pierre Strosser and conductor Christian Thielemann were not aiming at the kind of naturalistic staging - howling winds, heaving seas and ghostly mariners - that thrilled audiences in Wagner's time. Everything on the stage was pared down to a mini- mum (thank goodness, no dumb-show during the overture). The Dutchman's ship, its spectral crew and the sea itself were invisible - a yard or two of blood- red canvas would have cheered up the prevailing grey. Even Daland's ship was out of sight in the wings. All we saw were a few hawsers and some quayside gear. Mary and the maidens did not spin but mended sails. This made good sense, but isn't there a case for slightly amending the text at such moments to avoid blatant contradiction? \"Hum and whirr, good little wheel\" they sang (in German) with, I thought, maliciously careful enunciation. Costumes (by Pat- rice Cauchetier) were vaguely mid-19th century, the Dutchman in a loose over- coat, collar and tie. The first two sets, designed by the producer himself, gave the right, aus- tere background for this conception of the opera; the interior with high walls, a row of low windows and a huge black stove, was particularly satisfying. The last act by comparison looked haphaz- ard: it was not clear where the relayed voices of the ghostly crew were coming from. With any hint of Romantic para- phernalia sternly banished, Strosser's notable gift for devising meaningful slow movement and effective, relative positioning for his principals turned them into Ibsenite figures, fraught and tense. In the orchestra pit the overture, so carefully detailed by ihielemann and the Suisse Romande players, gave an indication of what was to come: a seri- ous, rather slow reading with crystal- line textures, long, pregnant pauses and, for this usually loud opera, low dynamic levels. The storm music was more suited to Mendelssohn's Hebrides than to Wagner's North Sea. In the big choral ensemble of the last act the pace flagged, never regaining momentum. Josd Van Dam sang the title-role. His sustained, legato lines constantly but never inappropriately recalled how much Wagner at that period was influ- enced by the Italian and French operas he had heard in Paris. Van Dam is hardly, I think, a natural Dutchman. His burnished timbre lacks a certain weather-beaten roughness not easily combined with such superior singing. Yet again and again the world-weari- ness was suggested by phrases of admi- rable finesse and faultless control. Linda Plech, the Senta, has some- thing of the compelling stage presence of (in their distinct ways) Barstow or SilUa with much of their intensity of phrasing and delivery. The voice changes colour abruptly; a certain glassiness, almost a whine, used at the expense of some splendid full notes, threatens to become a mannerism. Miss Plech did nothing dull or inept. Ben Heppner's Erik transformed that neces- sary but inconvenient figure into a real, even sympathetic, person. When he is caricatured as a greedy, grasping capitalist, Senta's father Daland becomes a bore. Hans Tscham- mer, young enough to pass for her brother, played him simply as an insen- sitive opportunist. The role gains immensely by being sung, as it was here, by a true basse chantante. Ferd- inand Seller made a real character of the sleepy steersman. Jean Laforge's excellent chorus was reinforced by the \"Ensemble vocal bulgare\". There was mild booing from the stalls for the pro- ducer but by the staid local standards the reception was friendly. Swiss reti- cence has one great advantage - audi- ences are blessedly still and quiet. Ronald Crichton",

   "text_content" : "NO European country has proved the prophets of doom wrong more often than Italy. Repeatedly, in recent years, it has appeared to be in the throes of insoluble crises. Every time, the country's infi- nitely ingenious politicians have managed to patch up yet another coalition - Italy is now on its 50th post-war gov- ernment - but only at the cost of delaying urgent decisions on structural economic reforms. This failure to grasp the net- tle has been masked by an ostensibly good economic per- formance. Italy has enjoyed a long period of rapid economic expansion. Though growth fell to 2 per cent in 1990, the lowest level since 1983, the latest report on Italy by the Organi- sation for Economic Co-opera- tion and Development fore- casts that it could well pick up to 2% to 3 per cent in 1992. Many other industrialised countries, particularly the UK, would be more than happy with such a prospect. The OECD, however, rightly points to the fundamental weaknesses of the Italian economy. It gives some startling statistics in sup- port of its warning that Italy must quickly pull up its socks if it hopes to join the European economic and monetary union as an equal partner. Italy has entered the present decade with one of the highest EC rates of inflation, unem- ployment and levels of public deficit. The jobless rate,. at about 11 per cent, is more than twice as high as the average in the other six major OECD countries. Inflation, at 7 per cent, is double that of Ger- many and France. Public spending Most worrying of all is the rapid expansion of public spending and the persistently high budget deficits. Since last year, Italy is the only OECD country where the ratio between public debt and gross domestic product both exceeds 100 per cent and is still rising. It would be unjust to accuse the government of taking no action at all to remedy this dire situation. The decision to join the narrow band of the European exchange rate mech- anism last year, together with the removal of remaining capi- tal controls, has kept the lira strong and led to some narrow- ing of interest rate differentials with Italy's European partners. In an attempt to stabilise the cost of debt service, now amounting to as much as 10 per cent of GDP, the govern- ment has also moved from short to medium and long-term borrowing. However, as the OECD stresses, there is only limited scope for reducing interest pay- ments through changes in debt management. The real problem to be tackled is a strengthen- ing of the primary budget bal- ance through a reduction of public spending. Lip service While all Italian politicians pay lip service to this objec- tive, they have so far signally failed to agree on the steps required to achieve it. These include, notably, bringing pub- lic sector pay under control after a rise of nearly 16 per cent last year, cuts in govern- ment subsidies, a widening of the tax base, reform of the national pensions scheme and accelerated privatisation. Given past experience, the OECD is undoubtedly justified in its scepticism about the effectiveness of the deficit-cut- ting measures likely to emerge from the current bout of politi- cal bargaining. With a general election due in May next year, the politicians will not want to take steps which could alienate the voters. The sad fact is that the Ital- ian political system does not produce strong enough govern- ments to take the hard deci- sions required today. In a refer- endum in the early summer, the vast majority of voters sup- ported electoral reform aimed at reducing the risk of fraud. The result was a sign that most Italians had had enough of political corruption and were ready for more sweeping reforms to make their political system more effective. Such changes, whether they take the form of a more pow- erful presidency or an electoral law favouring larger parlia- mentary majorities, will be dif- ficult to push through, since they require a two-thirds par- liamentary majority. Yet it is clear that, failing stronger gov- ernment, Italy is unlikely to take the radical steps needed to keep it in the front rank of European economies.",

   "text_content" : "LESS THAN two months after Brussels and Tokyo stitched together a deal on Japanese car sales in the European Com- munity, renewed frictions over the issue are raising the spec- tre of a fresh trade row. Still more serious, from the EC's standpoint, is the danger that its carmakers will use the affair as an excuse to continue to shirk actions essential to their survival and the health of Europe's industrial economy. Because the deal amounts to little more than a flimsy attempt to plaster over deep divisions in the EC's own ranks, it was always bound to provoke dispute, particularly with respect to Japanese- owned car \"transplants\" in the Community. That is now hap- pening. The UK government and Nissan of Japan say the arrangement allows unres- tricted transplant output. But much of the European indus- try, alarmed by an ominous recent slide in sales, says that is unacceptable. The dispute, at least, acknowledges one central real- ity: Japanese plants abroad, as much as those in Japan, are the international benchmark of competitiveness - which European producers are far from matching. However, the arguments deployed by Europe's carmakers to try to evade these uncomfortable facts are mostly specious. They complain that any ben- efit to consumers thom unres- tricted sales of Japanese cars is short-lived, because the Japa- nese use artiicially low prices to drive out Indigenous rivals, destroying the jobs and profits which underpin consumer spending. Japanese trans- plants, furthermore, generate relatively little employment or value added, and simply add to P-I capacity. EC prices The prices of Japan cars in the C scarcely suggest while in the US mar- hat m exporters appear at lest a open as the Japa- mese to charges of selling below cost It is undoubtedly true that Japanese transplants eploy reativelywer people than BE iuroe nwd M thes. But that i in large part because ther are mor effi- c _et -m es ty i1 At lem: it is too many obsolete, high-cost plants, which have survived thanks only to subsi- dies and protection. Preserving such capacity involves a mas- sively wasteful diversion of resources into an inefficient sector, penalising more effi cient industries and weakening European economies. Another favourite argument is that the EC should not open its market to the Japanese until Japan allows free access to EC car exports. Though for- mal Japanese trade restrictions have been largely eliminated, important obstacles to imports remain, notably in distribu- tion. However, the evidence suggests that the Europeans are seeking scapegoats for their own failures. Implicit assumption The implicit assumption that only structural barriers pre- vent European producers from storming the Japanese market is contradicted by their dismal performance in the US, where they once accounted for almost all imports. Today their mar ket share is less than five per cent, and Britain's Rover and France's Peugeot recently halted exports. The Japanese. meanwhile, have increased their share to one third of total sales, even though their exports were restricted for most of the 1980s by quotas. The \"trade reciprocity\" threat is also hollow since it would have to rely on formal controls on transplant output. But, as the European Commis- sion acknowledges, any such controls would violate the Rome Treaty and undermine the principle of free movement of goods on which the BC's anned single market is based. Central to the single market -pin is the belief that vigorous cross-border competition will stimulate ndotrial efficiency and restructuring. That compe- tition neither iuool - nor, in a world of mobile capital, can - be limited simply to ndigoe- a produrs, above allD S ndustrie where copet- itiveness ags behind world- asm standards.

   "text_content" : "American Express will have to innovate to stave off comnoetition, says Martin Dickson C all it the case of the revolt. ing restaurateurs. Mr Michel SRou, the owner of three of Britain's top restaurants, has just advised the world that the American Express card will no longer do nicely. Fed up with the fees he has to hand over to Amex, he is refusing to accept its plastic as payment, and is urging other smart eating establish- ments to do the same. His call to arms echoes a similar protest across the Atlantic, where a group of about 100 restaurants in the Boston area threatened to boycott Amex earlier this year unless it cut its fees. One of the protest leaders cheerfully posed for a picture showing him stabbing an Amex card with a chefs knife. Grousing by a hot-pot of chefs, how- ever exquisite the products of their kitchens, does not of itself constitute a serious blow to American Express, but is it extremely bad publicity - and it may also be a straw in the wind. For Amex, the company which taught the world to pay by plastic and is blessed with one of the most power- ful global brand names, is finding its franchise under attack as never before. The competition is hottest in the US where its rivals for consumer spend- ing power - in the industry argot, \"share of wallet\" - go well beyond the traditional humdrum Visa and MasterCards issued by banks. Varia- tions offer discounts on phone calls, points towards free airline tickets and ' cash savings. Amex would suffer badly if such rivals made big inroads into its mar- ket, for despite its growth into a financial services powerhouse, the company still depends on its card business for the great bulk of its prof- its. It would also be a severe personal blow to Mr James Robinson, the com- pany's head, who is sometimes known as the \"Teflon-coated chairman\" for his ability to rise above a series of disasters in the group's non-card busi- nesses which have repeatedly held back its earnings in recent years. This year Wall Street expects Amex's earnings from Travel Related Services - which includes its card operations - to be flat, due in part to a rise in credit delinquencies and in part to a slowdown in the growth of card earnings. Recession, which is hurting all card issuers, seems largely to blame and so far Amex appears to be holding its market share reason- ably well. But might the economic downturn be masking more fundamental shifts in spending patterns which could con- tinue hurting its franchise long after recovery gets under way? That ques- tion cannot be answered without looking at how Amex makes its money, how it differs from its rivals, and the vigour of its response to the challenge they pose. Most of the cards issued by Ameri- can Express - notably its traditional green and gold ones - are charge cards, which means the user has to pay off his bill at the end of every month. Amex makes its money by charging annual membership fees to card holders and by taking a percent- age of the \"take\" received by any mer- chant on bills paid using the card. The profits of the business are driven, therefore, by the number of card members enrolled and - most crucial of all - the amount they spend via their Amex card. So while Amex accounts for only 9 per cent of general purpose cards issued in the US, it is thought to take around 24 per cent of all billings - and that share has only dropped slightly over the past few years. The pieces of plastic issued by banks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are different. They are credit cards which allow a user to roll over the amount he owes from month to month, though the price of this flexi- bility is an extremely high rate of interest. The banks also charge merchants a percentage fee on any transaction and 7i --. r most US ones levy an annual fee from charge-card holders. But both of these are substantially lower than Amex's because the banks make much of their money from the interest bills run up by customers who don't clear their accounts each month - people known in the trade as \"revolvers\". Amex aims to attract a much more focused clientele - wealthier individ- uals or businesses who spend more per month via their cards than bank card users and promptly pay off their bills. Over the past two decades it has done so extremely successfully, thanks to four main factors. First, it has run a brilliant marketing cam- paign, which has emphasised the snob appeal and credit-worthiness of being a card holder \"It says more about you than cash ever can.\" Second, mer- chants have been persuaded that accepting Amex boosts boosts both their image and their profits. Third, it has backed its cards up with a high quality of customer service and a worldwide network of offices. And fourth, it has attracted a strong corpo- rate clientele. dut in many of these areas it is now under fierce attack from the credit card brigade. For a start, snob appeal is harder to sustain in a recession, in a market crowded with credit cards, and in a social climate which may be changing towards less conspicuous consump- tion. In the US the credit card issuers have been striking more quantifiable blows as well. In particular, Citicorp, the largest issuer of bank credit cards, and First National Bank of Chicago have linked up with two of the top airlines - American and United - in deals which offer card holders points towards free air travel for every dollar they spend. This struck so directly at the heart of the Amex market - the well-heeled frequent flier - that this summer it had to retaliate with a scheme of its own - linking it up with seven lead ing airlines, and going one better than its rivals by offering ground packages as well, such as \"once in a lifetime\" tennis lessons with a top professional. The package clearly costs it money, although it cla'nims the increased vol ume of business will outweigh this. American Express retains several other important advantages: unlike bank cards, it sets no spending limit and Visa and Mastercard cannot com- pete with its worldwide back-up ser- vice. \"You won't find a Citibank Visa office in Bombay,\" says Mr Philip Riese, a senior US Amex manager. \"You will find us.\" This global network, and Amex's important involvement in other areas of the travel business, is particularly useful for business customers, and Amex has built up a sophisticated ser- vice which allows companies using its cards to keep a close track on employ- ees' spending on travel and entertain- ment. This is turn helps the compa- nies control costs and strike deals with airlines and hotels for bulk dis- counts. But here too bank and non-bank credit card issuers are starting to stir. Amex is still the overwhelming indus- try leader, with an estimated 5m cor- porate cards issued in the US, com- pared to 500,000 for Mastercard and 750,000 for Visa. But Visa claims to be growing extremely rapidly, with a 50 per cent Increase in cards issued dur- ing just three months this summer. It also offers clients a customised expenses tracking service, although Mr Kurt Peters, editor of Credit Card News, says: \"Amex knows that mar- ket so well, its harder for the banks to get in. Amex knows just what kind of reports companies want.\" Amex insists It is still growing strongly in this area. Mr Jim Fire- stone, who handles US corporate accounts, says that over the past two years its client list among the Fortune 100 top companies has risen from 66 to 88, with the gains including Moto- rola, Mobil Oil, Texaco and Lockheed. But there have also been losses. Gen- eral Motors, for example, has switched to MasterCard - a move probably linked to the fact that its huge financial services arm issues MasterCards of its own. And Good- year, the tyre company, switched to Visa after surveying employees. Amex may be retaining its share of a growing corporate market, but the pressure from the competition seems certain to have forced cuts in the price it can charge for its cards, and thus its margins. A card is only useful if you have merchants that accept it, and Visa and MasterCard make much play of their roughly 9m outlets around the world compared to 3.3m for Amex. A advertisement due out soon from Visa, for example, will trumpet the fact that its plastic will be accepted at the turnstiles of the next Olympic Games. This is not necessarily a threat to Amex, as long as the high spenders it wants to attract can still use the card in plenty of up-market places. Far more serious would be mass defec- tions from the ranks of its merchants. That is unlikely to happen in its most important travel and entertain- ment markets - the airlines, hotels and top restaurants - as long as the company enjoys such a strong hold over corporate customers and high rolling individuals. But the retail and non-corporate markets seem less secure. Take, for example, Carnival Cruise Lines, the Miami-based company which accounts for about a quarter of all the US's holiday cruise business. It says it stopped taking the American Express card last year after failing to negoti- ate a sufficiently attractive new fee structure. It had been paying 3.2 per cent to Amex, which offered to drop the figure to 2.9, compared to the 1.15 per cent then charged by Visa. Mr Bob Dickinson, the Carnival executive involved, says Amex warned him the move would cost business, but the very opposite has been the case. The lessons, he says, are that 99.5 per cent of Amex card holders have Visa or MasterCards, and that in the leisure travel market \"Amex have no edge. They just price the product as if they do.\" They are also, he adds, \"arrogant as hell\". The recession has put American Express under pressure from numer- ous other sectors to cut the 1.25 to 2 per cent margin it charges above the bank cards, and in many cases - including the Boston chefs - it seems to have given ground. Says Mr Peters: \"A lot of the merchants making most noise end up not giving up Amex. There's a lot of smoke, but not much fire.\" But while that may be true, lower fees from merchants again hit Amex's profit margins. The company's core franchise seems reasonably secure for now, albeit frayed at the edges. But the fat profit margins American Express enjoyed in a less crowded market seem gone for ever, and it will have to keep innovating hard if it is to differ- entiate itself from the competition. American Express executives hint that more important initiatives are on the way this autumn. \"There have been announcements of our demise for many, many years,\" says Mr Riese, \"and they have all been prema- ture. I would suggest to the market - just watch us.\"",

   "text_content" : "n the UK, Ame rican Expuress, like other card Issuers, has been hit badly by the recession, writes John Authers. The new consumer frugality has created a vicious spiral for all credit card issuers. As the proportion or card users paying off their bills promptly has increased, (typically from less than a quarter to about 50 per cent), so the cards became less profitable for their issuers. In response, the four big clearing banks introduced annual charges for cards. This provoked many customrer to switch loyalties to smaller institua- tions which refused to introduce charges, such as Save & Prosper. Today, two new approaches make sense for card issuers. They can cut their \"extras\", trim costs and com- pete on price, or add as many genu- inely useful perks as possible. This view of the market is implicit in National Westminster's new range of credit cards, launched when the bank introduced a fee on all its credit cards last month. Mr Mike McManus, Barclaycard's managing director, says of Amex's problem.s: \"Reutailers are realising that most Amex card-holders have also got a Visa or MasterCard.\" The focus of the debate in the UK has moved on from the price charged to retailers to the fees paid by card- holders. Amex's charges are high; its basic Green card costs Â£37.50, the Gold Â£85, and the Platinum service, launched in January, weighs in at \"300. Amex is clearly fighting back; next week, it launches an advertising cam- waign to persuade its card-holders to resume spenring on life's lurnries.",

   "text_content" : "*\"On yer bike\" became one of British political life's more memorable eighties' exhortations. When challenged on the issue of the Conservative party's record on unemployment, Norman Tebbit, leading Thatcherite groupie, once used the example of his father who, he said, did not bemoan his fate but rather \"got on his bike\" and went out looking for work. \"On yer bike\", pronounced with a peculiarly east London twang, then became a rallying-cry or an odious sneer, depending on one's political affiliations. But some entrepreneurs too- the message to heart in a more than metaphorical sense and one has just demonstrated that it suited his spirit very well. At 37, Richard Gabriel, founder and chairman of the delivery company Interlink, has sold his 55 per cent stake in the company for almost Â£28m; not bad for an initial outlay of Â£13A000, itself a loan from Barclays bank. The Australlan transport and security concern, Mayne Nickless, paid a total Â£50.5m for the company. The irony is that Gabriel, formerly a milkman and motorcycle courier, got off his bike to start his meteoric rise to riches. He sod his motorcycle for m50 to start his first company, Road Runner, a messenger service. Gabriel's knack, which increased his shareholdng's worth by 68 per cent in the last five years (since Interlink was floated), was to expand through liensng francbise olders, gradually blomomng nto a national network of 150 dhfent franchbisees, en oft the country's largest overnight -oel delivery service.

Archbishop Huddleston's letter (September 20) shows that the Anti-Apart- heid Movement is locked into the same sort of time warp. The process of change in South Africa is irreversible, but a future democracy can only succeed, and indeed sur- vive, if the economy is suffi- ciently robust to meet at least the minimum expectations of the majority. A necessary con- dition for generating growth in the economy is external invest- ment and access to loans. This growth is needed to generate the wealth with which a future government can provide jobs, housing, education and health- care. ANC economists are awakening to the fact that there is a time lag between starting to stimulate growth and achieving results. Action is needed now if a future demo- cratic government is to inherit a viable situation.

   "text_content" : "Burdened by an economy limping from crisis to crisis, Brazil is undergoing social unrest morer insidious than revolution, writes Christina Lamb nomic no rturmo ti, the miitary elected president.o o of As iU to confirm their fears, President Fernando Cpollor diti- ians bisiwst Brazil is Ruffering Meits wor last crssweek summoned the164 when, amid social and eco- nomic turmoil, the Counciltary overthrew the country's last elected president. As if to confirm their fears, President Fernando Collor de Mello last week summoned the first meeting of the Council of the Republic which, under the constitution, is convened only in times of national emer- gency. His message was stark: the state is bankrupt and with- out constitutional overhaul the country is ungovernable and headed for hyperinflation. Mr. Collor's sombre words were little surprise to most Brazilians. After 10 years of chronic inflation and midway through the second year of recession, economic crisis is nothing new to the largest debtor in the developing world. What has changed, however, is the realisation that Latin America's giant is being left behind not just by its south- east Asian rivals but more humiliatingly by the rest of the Latin American continent. There is a growing consen- sus that economic shock plans do not work and that it is time to find a long-term solution based on a \"national under- standing\". The most important factor in this new thinking has been the transformation of neighbour and traditional rival Argentina from economic chaos to a country with a respectable 1.3 per cent monthly inflation rate and pre- dicted growth this year of 5 per cent. By comparison, Brazil is expecting 19 per cent inflation this month and two more years without growth. While Brazil could shrug off the successes of Mexico, Venezuela and Chile, the example of Argen- tina, as a fellow democracy, is harder to stomach. Brazilians are finally admit- ting the depth of the crisis, asking why they cannot pro- duce political and business leaders and realising that their country is undergoing social unrest more insidious than revolution. Land invasions are a daily occurrence; kidnap- pings are too frequent to make the news; both Rio and Sio Paulo average more than one bank robbery a day; and teen- agers in Sao Paulo are shot dead for their sneakers. Brazil's per capita gross domestic product may have remained almost stable in the past decade while its neigh- bours experienced an average 2.2 per cent drop but its infra- structure is disintegrating. It also has one of the most uneven distributions of income \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t in the world -- 60 per cent of national wealth is concen trated in the hands of 1 per cent of the population. The problem for the govern- mnent is what to do to prevent the country lurching from one short-lived economic plan to the next. It is risking every thing on a revision of the 1988 constitution to allow it to raise taxes and cut federal spending, following the recipe of the International Monetary Fund with which it is negotiating a $2bn standby loan facility. The government believes a constitutional overhaul is nec- essary because under the pres- ent system it cannot sack fed- eral employees and must pass on almost half of its tax reve- nues to states and municipali- ties. To change this, it needs a three-fifths majority in two votes in Congress, where it has little support. In an unsubtle effort to secure backing for its constitutional reforms, the gov- ernment is offering to ease the repayment terms of the state governments' total $57bn debt to the Treasury. Mr Eduardo Suplicy, an economist with the opposition Workers party, com- plains: \"The government cannot just shift the blame on to Congress and say we cannot govern unless you change the constitution.\" The biggest hindrance to reform is the government's lack of credibility. Gone is the tanned hero who strode into office in March 1990 like Indi- ana Jones. Mr Collor's single bullet with which he pledged to kill inflation has landed spectacularly off-target, creat- ing a mere lull in inflation and a 4.6 per cent contraction in the economy last year. In July the government issued Trea- sury notes to increase its inter- nal debt despite saying last year that it would not do so. As well as notching up two failed economic plans in 18 months Mr Collor has seen the resignation of six of his 12 min- isters as well as an entire eco- nomics team, got through four heads of Petrobras, the state oil company which is Latin America's largest corporation, and three heads of Embraer, the state aeronautics company. Worse, for a man on a crusade, his administration is now mired in allegations of corrup- tion involving friends, his brother and his wife. A year ago, Mr Collor was getting pop- ularity ratings of 80 per cent; now he faces calls to resign. Brazil remains one of the world's most protected econo- mies with an average import tariff of 40 per cent, compared with Argentina's 11.5 per cent. Business remains cartelised a:nd unco-operative with eco- nomic stabilisation plans. It blames a squeezing of credit and continuing restrictions on mports of computers and other electronic products for a ailure to modernise and become more competitive, and obbies to slow down or even halt the liberalisation process. Brazil also lags behind other Latin American countries in Irivatisation. Its first sale, of he country's biggest steel mill, once scheduled for tomorrow, has been suspended by a fed- eral court ruling. To the government's credit Mr Carlos Garcia, the adminis- ration secretary, says he has emoved 111,553 bureaucratic regulations and cut 207,000 fed- eral employees, though because of constitutional restrictions 47,000 of the fed- eral workers are still being paid. Opposition politicians claim, however, that only 3,800 ederal employees were actu- vly sacked, the rest having left or retired. The current lack of faith in he government means any- hing it tries to do has the wrong effect. Interest rates, aised recently to almost 1,000 Iearcllto oriartthe ercorcny tvs r dethme, erposan the believed the governmnt would- notresoto price fdrsc in fiveu Malan economiat economy the Smain anoppositi-shock minister\", but a survey oflike chief eesscu- ives by thnone American Cham- ber of Commerce found recently that only 11 per cent believed the government would new ot resortto drastic measures tocontrol cenflation. Mr Cesar Maia, an economist from the main opposition party (PMDB), says: \"the's like playing chessplan. drunk - none of their moves turns out as they Intend.\" anof the constitutional amend- ment does not pass through Congress, or, as seems likely, survives in a watered down version, the government holds few other cards. Options include the creation with the IMF an inde- pendent central bank or copy- ing the latest Argentine plan. The government's most pressing reason for avoiding another quick-fix solution is that this would almost cer- tainly enta il the removal or resignation of the orthodox Mr Moreira as economy minister, and would jeopardise Brazil's negotiations with the IMP and creditor banks. Mr Moreira has been responsive to foreign demands to open up the coun- try's stock market and to allow debt to be swapped for environ- mental protection proects. His proposal to restructure Brazil'scking $52bn commercial debt has been warmly welcomed by. creditors and has paved the way for Brazil to return to the international capital markets for the first time in a decade. But the clock is ticking against Mr Collor and inflation is moving inexorably upwards. The psychological barrier of 20 per cent a month, at which point a new plan is thought inevitable, could come next month. Inflationary factors include: September's six- monthly adjustment of wages and rents; the doubling of the minimum salary to which most wages are pegged; growing pressure to devalue the cru- zeiro to help exports; the gov- ernment's promised release of $1.8bn into the economy which was seized in a draconian assets' freeze in March 1990. Although most Brazilians now recognise the scale of the country's crisis, Mr Collor comes late and enfeebled to negotiations with political and business leaders who still jeal- ously guard their own posi- tions. Economists fear that Brazil may yet have to see open hyperinflation before such groups are really pre- pared to put the country's interests before their own. .",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Peter J Jones. Sir, Your editorial, \"Competi- tion in Gas\" (September 20) misrepresented the- current state of affairs in the UK gas market and was somewhat misdirected in its criticism of British Gas. The gas regulatory framework established in the UK, as overseen by Ofgas, is rather remarkable in the Euro- pean context and is perfectly adequate. This is evident from the progress made by the inde- pendent gas marketers over the past 1-2 years. Notwithstanding (unjustif- ied) historical criticism, BG provides a fuel aggregation and supply service with both advantages and disadvantages. However, with published price schedules and published trans- portation tariffs, there are, in reality, no barriers to the entry of independent companies to the UK gas market. As such, BG's inability to supply gas to potential power generators should be seen as a positive factor in stimulating gas sup- ply competition. If power gen- erators cannot get the gas they want hfrom BG, they will have to go directly either to produc- ers (as BG would have to do) or to independent marketers. In this way, power generation, the fastest growing sector of the UK gas market, will not be dominated by BG. There are two main prob- lems affecting the UK gas industry. First, potential gas producers and power genera- tors have preferred to involve BG in the supply/demand pro- cess. While this probably reflects both project financing considerations and the greater degree of operational flexibil- ity/supply security offered by BG, it is a sad reflection of the apparently unimaginative approach to gas pur- chases/sales adopted thus far by both independent power generators and UK gas produc- ers. Second, no-one believes that all or even a majority of the power generation projects mooted will proceed. This is not a problem related to the inability to secure gas. It has much more to do with the dubious financial viability of a project whose end-product may be sold at a price which may not recover costs. This company has been a vociferous critic of BG in the past. In this instance, however, while one cannot deny BG's influence in the market, it is the industry in general which is in danger of missing an excellent commercial opportu- nity. Your editorial would have been far better directed at Brussels in an attempt to sos- ter true competition in the European gas industry. Our view is that the present diff- cuities in the UK can be over- come if gas producers and gas purchasers are prepared to approach the problem with a degree of lateral thinking.

Sir, Robert Peston's revela- tions on the proposed Banking Code of Practice (\"Banks' bill of rights\", September 19) and in particular that banks will not pass on information on customers to other companies in the same group without express consent, holds enor- mous portent, not just for banks but for the whole direct marketing industry. Such a move will force a sea change having frightening and immediate consequences for a large number of financial ser- vices companies. Research indicates that the majority of consumers would not \"opt in\" to necessarily vague offers of future product information, albeit for specific products or product groups; first, they often cannot foresee what their future needs may be and, sec- ond, a natural laziness would prevent many from completing a form. While no-one could argue with one of the proposed code's governing principles - that of \"acting fairly and reasonably in dealings with customers\" - it would surely be preferable for banks, building societies and other financial institutions to follow existing industry guidelines on ist and database practice, giving consumers the opportunity to \"opt out\" of receiving future information and offers they know they do not want to receive.

   "text_content" : "Pal Ceeseght says West Midlands engineering companies are seeking salvation in Europe s the British economy limps out of recession into recovery, some British ageering comipaies have discovered a lifeinae in their growing Inter-depen- dence on the German market. Nowhere Is this more apparent than in the West Midlands, the centre of the UK automotive industry. \"The German automotive market particularly has helped us quite a lot and been a sav- iour for a lot of companies,\" notes Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of the West Mid- lands regional council of the Confederation of British Industry and chief executive of Heath Spring, an automotive components company. Now, however, Germany's economy is experiencing prob- lems. Rising inflation and higher interest rates, coupled with the costs of reunification are flattening internal demand. West German export- ers, using British components and material, are finding it difficult to sell in lacklustre international markets. So the saviour looks as if it is suffer- ing a temporary enfeeblement. Yet, just as British compa- nies are watching with some anxiety the tightening of the Germany economy, so German companies are participating in the faltering steps of the Brit- ish recovery. According to a Warwick University study pre- pared for Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, consultants, about 15,000 German companies trade with the UK. By last year there were about 950 Ger- man companies with UK sub- sidiaries. Since 1985, according to the West Midlands Development Agency, set up to attract inward investment, half of all German investment in the UK has been in the region; it cal- culates that there are now 200 German companies with man- ufacturing operations in the West Midlands. Half the Ger- man arrivals in the area since 1986, noted the Warwick study, have been in the engi- neering and automotive sec- tors. While German investment in the UK was gathering pace during the 1980s, British engi- neering groups were becoming increasingly drawn to the Ger- man market. The lesson of the UK recession of the early 1960s was that corporate sur- vival could not be secured by relying on the domestic mar- ket. So automotive compo- nents suppliers, faced with a contraction of the British car industry, both increased direct sales into, and set up manufac- turing subsidiaries in, Euro- pean Community countries. The size of the German market made it an obvious target. Thanks partly to the engi- neering sector, British trade with Germany grew to the extent that Germany sup- planted the US as the UK's big- gest customer. Total British exports to Germany rose from Â£11.lbn in 1989 to Â£13.1bn in 1990 and in the first five months of this year were Â£5.9bn. Within the total, Brit- ish machinery and transport equipment sales rose from Â£4.8bn in 1989 to Â£5.9bn in 1990; this year such sales were Â£2.8bn in the first five months. Consultants to Industry, part of the Engineering Employers' West Midlands Association, has noted that in the automotive sector, UK sup- pliers to Germany \"have been successful across a wide range of equipment types, ranging from basic components in metal and plastic, to complete engines and transmissions, notably for the US-owned Ford and General Motors operations\". It also observed that Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen have purchasing offices in the UK. One such successful supplier is GKN, one of the main UK players in the international automotive components sector. Its core product is constant velocity joints, which connect an engine to the wheels of a vehicle and cause the wheels to rotate. GKN is unequivocal about the German market: it is \"all important\". GKN will not divulge precise figures about its German busi- ness but said that this year Germany would absorb one third of its total sales to car and commercial vehicle mak- ers. Assuming the German market took a similar portion of its business in 1990 - when German car production held up better than Spanish, Italian or UK production - sales were probably worth about Â£885m to GKN out of a total group turnover of Â£2.04bn. Smaller companies have also found Germany attractive. Frederick Cooper, an indus- trial holding company based in Walsall, has, in the past 18 months built up its German sales of seals, used in double- glazed doors and windows, from nothing to Elm a year. Sales of its pre-coated metal to Germany have accelerated over the past two years, said Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, observing that \"the coatings market has increased follow- ing (German) unification; the products go into low-value But how long the engineer- ing industry can continue to increase sales to Germany is a matter of doubt GEKN does not believe that the buoyancy of the German car market \"will all fall away again\", but it pre- dicts a decline in German car production from 4.66m units in 1990 to 4.A2m this year and 4.58m in 1992 before a slight recovery in 1993. The down- ward trend may already have begun in August, when Ger- man new car sales are esti- mated to have fallen by 20.1 per cent to 200,000 from 251,000 a year ago. Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham stockbroker which tracks the performance of the British components makers, believes their profits will be lower this year, then unchanged next. Feelings of unease are not confined to the automotive sector. W Canning, the Bir- mingham-based company, has an electronics components dis- tribution business in Ger- many, selling largely to medi- um-sized German engineering companies dependent on export markets. \"This business has been quiet and shows every sign of continuing to be quiet,\" said Mr Ron Brown, Canning's finance director. An upturn in the UK market for manufactured products would compensate for any German downturn, but such a trade-off looks doubtful. For the next few months British engineering companies will probably have to contend not only with a weak domestic market but also with a weak- ening German market.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Deipsey in Zagreb and Michael Llttlejolhn at the United Nations THE latest attempted ceasefire between Croat and federal Yugoslav forces got off to a shaky start yesterday as shoot- ing broke out in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and federal army troops attacked the eastern city of Osijek. Shortly after Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, and Gen Vejiko Kadijevic, the federal defence minister agreed an \"absolute and mutual cease- fire\" to take effect at 3pm local time, sniper gunfire echoed through the streets of Zagreb and sporadic fighting continued in other parts of the republic. With both sides alleging violations, Gen Kadijevic sent a letter to Mr Tudj- man demanding an urgent halt to attacks and listing 11 ceasefire viola- tions by Croatian forces within five hours of the truce. Mr Tudjman said yesterday that negotiations on separating the warring parties would begin once the ceasefire was in place. He said the talks would attempt to implement an EC-sponsored peace pact brokered last week by Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary. The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet at foreign ministers' level on Wednesday or Thursday to con- sider the Yugoslav crisis, especially if the ceasefire again fails to hold, offi- cials said last night. France, current president of the Council, has proposed the session. The UN must be careful in approaching Yugoslavia's problems because of the rule against interference in the internal affairs of a member state. This could be over-ridden it it was determined that civil war in Yugoslavia would constitute a wider threat to inter- national peace and security. Then, a series of measures could be set in train, including an arms embargo or a ban on oil shipments. In an attempt to secure the tenth ceasefire in three months, Mr Tudjman, whose ill-armed forces lost control of Petrinja and other towns during heavy fighting with the federal army at the weekend, ordered the republic's nation- al guard to stop fighting. He also called for the immediate restoration of medi- cal, food, water and electricity supplies to all federal army barracks in Croatia which have been blockaded by Croatian national guardsmen for over a week. The shooting in the Croatian capital, however, coincided with reports by Zagreb radio that federal army units and Serb paramilitary forces had fired artillery and mortar ammunition on Osijek, the largest town in Slavonia. Mr Milan Brezak, the deputy interior min- ister of Croatia, said he was \"pessimis- tic\" about the latest ceasefire. He said Gen KadiUevic \"could not be trusted\" to enforce any ceasefire.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent T'HE European Community and Japan remain divided on key issues concerning Japa- nese car sales in Europe, including the level of Japanese vehicle production within the EC and the sharing of future growth or decline in demand for new vehicles. According to previously unpublished statements, pro- duced as appendices to the main EC/Japan agreement on trade in cars in Europe which was reached at the end of July, the Japanese side has refused to recognise either: * the Commission's \"working assumption\" that Japanese transplant production (vehicles built at Japanese plants located in Europe) would reach only 1.2m by the end of 1999, or, * the Commission's \"internal ar w sm secord n ght ono ooener ...............................Page 4 f-proeln g ca I no joyride .......................................... Page 9 Mtor.l ommnt ........................................Page 14 declaration\" that EC producers should benefit from one-third of the growth in the EC new vehicle market in the 1990s, and that Japanese producers should cut their direct vehicle exports from Japan in the case of demand not meeting earlier forecasts. In the deal reached at the end of July, entitled \"Elements of Consensus\", Mr Frans Andriessen, European commis- sioner for external affairs and Mr Nakao, Japanese minister for international trade and industry, agreed there would be \"no restrictions on Japanese investment\" in the Commu- nity, and that there would be \"free circulation\" in the EC for European-built Japanese vehicles. An appendix to the main agreement, hitherto unpub- lished, contains further decla- rations in which Mr Andries- sen seeks Japanese backing for the 1.2m transplant figure. He tells Mr Nakao: \"During these negotiations, the Com- mission has based itself on var- ious working assumptions con- cerning the automobile market developments in the future including an estimate of 1.2m vehicles\" for the annual sales volume by 1999 of European- built Japanese vehicles in the EC. In a formal reply Mr Nakao revuses to take up the trans- plant output figure of 1.2m vehicles and refers instead to Japanese direct exports to the EC having been forecast after \"taking into account total demand.\" In a second appendix, the Commission states a clear aim for European carmakers to benefit from at least a third of future growth in the EC new vehicle market, and it presents a formula for Japanese produc- ers to cut exports if the market falls below forecast levels. These goals are excluded from both the main document and the supplementary \"con- clusive declarations\", and are relegated to an \"internal decla- ration\" by the Commission.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Littlejohns at the United Nations THE RST'i phase of what is likely to be the biggest-ever United Nations peacekeeping and election-control operation is expected to be launched iiin Cambodia in mid-November. This follows the resolution of the main issues in the effort to end the country's civil war. UN officials were confident last night at the end of talks in New York that a peace agree- ment to end the 12-year con- flict will be ready for signing in Paris next month, paving the way for the peace-keeping operation that could cost up to $6bn (Â£3.4bn) over two years. The officials said it was vital to have a UN good-offices mis- sion, comprising military and civilian personnel, in place soon. The Security Council is expected to meet shortly to approve that proposal, a first step towards the establishment of a UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac). Representatives of the US, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China were joined by Indonesia's envoy - as co- chairman of the Paris confer- ence - in talks at the UN on Friday that were expanded on Saturday to include the other members of the 19-nation Paris group, including Japan. For the first time, in Cam- bodia, the Japanese may be able constitutionally to con- tribute troops to a UN force. In any event, they are expected to be a principal financial backer of Untac. After the final New York meeting, Sir John Coles, the chief British negotiator, said: \"There are no substantive diffi- culties remaining.\" He was confident a peace accord would be signed by ministers in Paris \"about the end of October\". Mr Hun Sen, Cambodia's prime minister, said: \"It only remains to sort out detailed arrange- ments on military matters.\" In general, what he termed the \"complexities of the problem\" had been settled. The breakthrough came with his acceptance of proportional representation as the basis for UN-supervised elections to a national assembly in all 20 provinces. He had previously insisted on a \"winner take all\" system in the electoral dis- tricts. That was opposed by the insurgent leaders, including Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Although the permanent members of the Security Coun- cil preferred a 100 per cent demobilisation of Cambodian forces before elections, there now is agreement on a 70 per cent demobilisation, with the remaining troops being dis- armed and confined to bar- racks. Eventually, there would be either total demobilisation or absorption into a Cambo- dian national army. The precise details have yet to be worked out of the rela- tionship between Untac and the Cambodian Supreme National Council, the coalition of insurgent groups which is headed by the Prince. The UN is supposed to review impor- tant decisions to ensure com- pliance with a peace accord. Despite last night's opti- mism, some diplomats cau- tioned that Pol Pot, whose Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for at least 1m Cambodian deaths before being overthrown by Vietnam, could give trouble. Officially \"retired\", he is thought to be in a jungle hideaway.",

The auction of Usiminas, the country's largest steel mill, was due to take place tomor- row, and several foreign groups and banks had qualified to bid. However, at the week- end a federal judge ruled in favour of a civil action to sus- pend the flotation.

But the main reason for the action is the government's decision to allow foreign debt instruments to be used a cur- rencies in the auction. The ruling is the latest in a series of hitches to the state sell-offs, which were initially planned to start in June 1990. Brazil's attorney-general rec- ommended the auction's sus- pension 10 days ago or the grounds that Mr Fernando Col- lor de Mello, Brazilian presi- dent, had exceeded his author- ity by allowing foreaign debt to be used. Mr Collor's own vice-president had spoken openly against the sale. The government will today ppeal gainst the ruling. But an ofacial from the National Development Bank (BNDES), which is overseeng the pro- gramme, admitted yesterday that even if the sale d now go ahead there will be a seri- ous lack of credibility and con- siderable fear that it might later be annulled. The official added that the Usminas' flotation price was likely to be lower than expec- ted, particularly if the court ruled that foreign debt instru- ments might not be used. BNDES estimates that there is $S5bn in eligible foreign debt and has set a discount rate of 25 per cent to make the equity = attractive to creditor The main group in the bid- ding for Usiminas is J.P.

   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson and Diane Summers A MAJORITY of UK manu- facturers expects an improve- ment In output volumes for the first time In 16 months, adding weight to claims from the government and the Bank of England that the economy is climbing out of recession. According to the Confedera- tion of British Industry's lat- est survey of monthly trends, the protracted decline in man- ufacturing output is expected to end by the end of the year, as a result of a slight improve- ment in domestic and export orders. The survey for September, which Interviewed 1,456 com- panies, accounting for half the UK's manufacturing exports and employment in 50 indus- tries, records its first positive balance on output expecta- tions since May 1990. Twenty-one per cent of com- panies expected their output to improve over the next four months, while 20 per cent expected a further decline. The difference between the two, which gives a guide to current trends, was a slight, but posi- tive, 1 percentage point. It compares with a negative bal- ance of 6 percentage points in August and a 10-year low of minus 36 percentage points in February. \"This is the most positive sign yet that manufacturing industry is begnninng to move out of recession,\" said Mr David Wigglesworth, chair- man of the CBFs economic sit- uation committee. He said, however, that order books remained weak and signs of recovery were \"still patchy\". The CBI's caution ties in with the warning given by Mr Norman Lamoent, the chancel- lor, In an interview last week. He said that although eco- nomic statistics were encour- aging, the recovery would have \"jagged edges\". Meanwhile, a survey on pay settlements by Incomes Data Services, the pay research grpo said that the relation- ship between pay and the inflation rate as measured by the retail prices index had Inflation now acted as a \"floor\" for pay settlements, rather than as a \"cellng\", as in the second half of 1390. Pay settlements over the coming months would be between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, sceeding the rate inflation, which Is expected to fal to 4 per cent or below by October. Wage deals, Page 10",

   "text_content" : "I\" WOULD drw your attention to the significance of the dog in the night \"But the dog did wthih in the night.\" \"That is s ficance of the dog in the Sherlock Holmes (with apolo- gies to Barry Riley) is relevant again. Last week we had some large, old-fashioned bids, but the watchdogs in the market scarcely stirred, and that is the significant point. The dog, if you remember, did not stir because he knew the footsteps that disturbed him; and the market did not stir because it has been discounting some bids before it saw any. It has just been a matter of rounding up the usual sus- pects. This does not mean that the bids are of no significance. Studies of bids have shown only questionable benefits to the bidder or to the economy. They also show that there is always a benefit to the share- holders in the victim company, who get a share at least of the value the bidder hopes to unlock - and on occasion, all of it and more. This can be just as true, as we were reminded recently with Etam, of failed as of successful bids. Bids, then, ought to be good news. In that case, why the yawn? Either because the market was only saved from further falls by the bids, or because the market doubts that there are any more where those came from. Both statements probably have The corporate troubles that are still appearing are concerned with over-valued assets rather than under-used ones, which is hardly inviting something in them. The opti- mism of the chancellor and of many profits forecasts is get- ting stale (and a bit implausi- ble), so the market has been sullen about other good news, notably the fall in interest rates. It has got ahead of itself, like the housing market. It needs a steady flow of better news simply to stand still. However, future good news is more likely to be about the economy than about bids. In these days of debt aversion, there is bound to be a distinct shortage of bidders, and those that do appear are likely to be more cautious about paying fancy prices for goodwill and hope. That is one reason why the habitual bidders had been rather slow to move. There is also, after the long shake-out, a shortage of ill-managed compa- nies to tempt them. The corporate troubles that are still appearing are con- cerned with over-valued assets rather than under-used ones, By Anthony Harris which is hardly inviting. Where management is thought to be due for replacement, the investing institutions and the banks now feel forced to move, rather than to wait for a bidder to spare them the unpleasant- ness, and so leave shareholders to soldier on. Wasserstein Per- alla showed this again with Isosceles last week, and history will surely go on repeating itself with other debt-laden companies. In short, these are not accidents, but a natural result of risk-averse lending and a squeeze on profit mar- gins. How far do prices now reflect these sober realities? Sluggish prices suggest some awakening, but I suspect that a lot of investors are inclined to snuggle back under the covers rather than take measure of the grey weather outside. The measure of this is in the old-fashioned tone of most of the brokers' comment. Most of this still seems to assume that normal service will be resumed, though not perhaps as soon as had been hoped. A solid discussion of a world in which easy credit, which has fuelled all the booms of the last three decades, may not be seen again for another two or three, would be more impressive. The banks are not the only people who are now risk- averse. The US Congress is showing an acute appreciation of what has changed in its work on the official proposal to modernise the US banking sys- tem. This is only in the sub- committee stage at the moment, and there is time for compromise before the end of next month, when the two houses will try to reconcile their proposals. It already seems clear, though, that what will emerge will be far short of the Administration's hopes - so far, perhaps, that the whole reform and repeal of Glass-Steagall, which has been under discussion for more than five years, may be deferred yet again. Congress seems ready to let banks diversity their risks by covering more territory (which is itself a major advance, given the lobbying power of local banks), but not to allow them to take new clas- ses of risk, in insurance of investment under-writing. This is all sharply disap- pointing to the White House, which goes on vapouring about the \"necessity\" to make US banks \"internationally compet- itive\", but Congress is surely right to shrug this off. It is not clear that competition of the kind that can be shown in league-tables is necessary, or even desirable, where banking is concerned. The Fed, which used to bang its drum very loudly for reforms of this kind, is now making no more than routine gestures of acceptance, and for good reason. During the bank- ing troubles of recent years, its research staff has invested enormous effort to devising models of possible banking troubles. Only one of them proved reliable, according to Manuel Johnson, the recent vice-chairman of the Fed, who was passing through London last week. The one infallible sign of trouble was the growth rate of the bank. The faster they grew, Academic studies have always suggested that a healthy banking system should grow fairly closely in step with the real economy the harder they fell. This ought not to be surprising, since aca- demic studies have always suggested that a healthy bank- ing system should grow fairly closely in step with the real economy, but it is still a sur- prise, after the gung-ho 1980s, to find that it really is as sim- ple as that. It is surely a lesson which all the central banks will take to heart once they turn to discussing future pol- icy, rather than the blame for past scandals. This is good news for the long-term conquest of inflation, and for avoiding future waste of what look like increasingly scarce resources; for the same reason, it is bad news for speculators. It is bad news especially for those who still hope that the rubble of debt and ill-advised investment left over from a decade of fatuous optimism will be cleared up by inflation, or a surge in the real economy, as happened last time, and the time before that.",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-23",
   "text_content" : "The sharp rise of Japan's trade surplus this year, after four years of steady declines, has all the ingredients for the remake of a horror movie classic. The chief question on all the critics' (economists) lips is: after rising from the dead, how soon can the monster be killed off again? The answer: the THING has power to spare. The resurrection of the sur- plus, which was 68.4 per cent higher in August alone com- pared with last year, has been attributed to many \"special\" factors, such as the strength of the yen or the fall in oil prices. Yet the combination of enough special factors can add up to a trend that could be very persistent and extremely annoying to Japan's trade part- The relentless rise of Japan's trade surplus in the last decade to a peak of $82.7bn (Â£49bn) (customs cleared) in 1987 was the source of fierce interna- tional arguments that led Japan finally to adopt strong, =nd successful, measures to reverse the trend. Last year as a result, the same figure declined to just l52.1bn. Yet this year these good efforts appear to have come unravelled. Japan's trade surplus is soar- ing again, and if some econo- mists are right, all the old records will soon be broken, perhaps as soon as next year, when the trade surplus by some estimates may approach 1Oim. The retrn of the trade sur- pla has raised quetius about at, if anything went wrong, nd whe- r the surplus wl really prove as pe t ant Following the 19M Plasa Ioad by wcd the ndustril radius agreed to try to raise do vatae of the yen, te Japa- mese government adopted bread maiui asUld at ste- the trade sur s.

As a result the surplus fell from 4.7 per cent of gross national product in 1987 to 2.2 per cent last year. Yet plenty of evidence is now emerging that the restructuring of the Japanese economy may not have been as thorough as hoped for. The Japan Development Bank, for example, last week issued a report on the chang- ing demand patterns that lay behind the rise in imports to Economics Notebook By Steven Butler in Tokyo Japan during the period. The report oun that demand for ipots during the last few years of the decade was increasing at roughly twicme the of the ancrease in national income. Eurly In the decade, imports and national income were crmasing at the same pO e.

The income elasticity of demand for imports for the entire economy increased as the economy grew, because manufactured items accounted for an increasingly large share of imports. In other words, the rise in imports turned out to be mainly a function of economic t rrth ather thel any funda- mental restructuring of demamn. The author of the report con- dudes that the demand ratio for manufacturd goods would probably have declined with- out government import prom tiha ellort More worrisome, he says that mldntalnlg aomentum hor iacremhns Inports wll hs The report non the d r in ishes on a s-ena y <ptimis- tie note on the qein f the trae balance.

A half-point decline in the growth rate in that year would add $13bn to the surplus. The report has, none the less, been partially overtaken by events because Japan's rate of economic growth has slowed sharply to an annualised rate of just 2 per cent in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter. The slower rate of growth depresses demand for imports and gives Japanese manufac- turers a strong incentive to seek overseas markets. And although the yen value of exports is not terribly inspir- ing, the dollar values that are watched by trade partners are still perky. For example, the yen value of exports rose by just 1.6 per cent in August compared with a 10.4 per cent rise in dollar values. Between the rise in the yen, the slowdown in the domestic economy, the low price of oil compared with last year, and an expected revival of demand from the US, Japan is et for a string of monthly Jolts as trade statistics are announced.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Pston and Roland Rudd ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, has proposed that it buy British Coal, the coal pro- ducer which the government plans to privatise should it win the next general election. The offer, which is being examined by the Department of Energy, proposes solutions to the enormous difficulties of a privatisation outlined by N. M. Roths- child, the merchant bank advising the government on a sale of British Coal. A confidential report by Rothschild, recently passed to the Department of Energy and the Treasury, warns there will only be a \"remnant industry\" with an \"unpredictable income earnings stream\" if British Coal does not sign supply contracts with its main custom- ers, National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, by 192. Current contracts with National Power and PowerGen, which take most of British Coal's output, expire in March, 1993. Rothschild has told the Treasury that if British Coal does not sign medium-term contracts by 1992, up to 50 pits would have to close and 45,000 min- ers would lose their jobs. The corpora- tion would be left with no more than 10 pits and fewer than 15,000 miners. Rothschild has in effect presented two unpalatable choices to the government; either it must intervene in the commer- cial activities of the recently-privatised electricity generators, or preside over a massive programme of mining lay-offs. Apart from Anglo, it is understood that Hanson, the conglomerate, and RTZ, the mining group, have both told the government they would be keen to buy all or part of British Coal. But Anglo has told the government it is pre- pared to take control of British Coal even if no contracts with the generators have been signed. It would also be pre- pared to take on the responsibility for closing pits, rather than forcing the gov- ernment to streamline the industry prior tofv~tL as working with consul- tants on the possible acquisition of Brit- ish Coal since 1989, when it bought Coal- ite for Â£478m (6807m). A purchase by Ango could take place as soon as next sprig. Under its detailed proposals, a new company would be created, British Coal PLC, which would acquire both Anglo and British Coal's assets by mak- ing a massive issue of shares. In effect, this would be a reverse takeover of Brit- ish Coal by Anglo, although it would not be taking on all British Coal's liabilities. Many of the new shares in British Coal PLC could be sold to the public, satisfying the government's preference for widening share ownership through privatisation. The share issue would also minimise the debt burden in the merged businesses. British Coal's huge potential liabilities - for deafness and other industrial injuries, subsidence and recla- mation of disused mining sites - would not be acquired by Anglo but would be vested in a new trust, which would remain in the public sector. Rothschild has been compiling a list of options on how to sell British Coal which it will give to the government by the end of the month.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Holmes Protection Faces an Improbable Coup",
   "text_content" : "Norma Cohen and Jane Fuller explain a marvel T * his is the story of a most improbable boardroom coup, led by a man who, aside from his role at the com- pany in question, was completely unknown until early last summer to the institutions now backing him. His investment advisory company faces financial difficul- ties of its own and his former business partner was the subject of civil claims by his former employer. Yet, Holmes Protection Group - the London-listed, but US- based security group - has so stunningly failed to win the con- fidence of its institutional inves- tors that the improbable coup appears on the verge of success. Tomorrow, shareholders will decide whether to accept propos- als from Mr Eric Frank Kohn, chairman of Barons Financial Services (UK) - and owner of 0.53 per cent of Holmes - to elect a board which will appoint him acting chief executive officer and vice-chairman. How Mr Kohn came near to success is a marvel, even to some of those institutions which now say they are likely to support him. Yesterday, Mr Kohn said 4s per cent of shareholders would vote with him and that more sup port was pouring in daily. A recent Dun & Bradstreet report on Mr Kohn's company, Barons, gives it a rating of N4. This indicates \"a financial strength which is negative and an overall condition which is Poor\". The report describes the company's trend as \"down\" and urges that guarantees be sought by those extending credit. Meanwhile, Mr Kohn's former partner in Barons, Mr Brian McHugo, has been the subject of civil suits from Greyhound Dial Corp. Mr McHugo had been head of Greyhound's Swiss-based financial and leasing subsidiary. He was accused of having made improper loans to shipowners. In March 1990, Mr McHugo was the subject of a so-called Mareva injunction freezing his assets world-wide. This, Mr Kohn said, was the first he knew of his partner's activities, although he says he had heard vague unsubstantiated talk of problems before he entered the partnership. Upon learning of the Mareva, Mr Kohn says he immediately took steps to sever the relationship and by September 1990, Mr McHugo was no longer associated with Barons. Mr Kohn acknowledged that Swiss Bank Corp is still seeking roughly SFrIm ($680,000) from his firm's Geneva-based parent, half of which was guaranteed by him self, the other nhalf by Mr McHugo. But despite these. difficulties, Mr; Kohn has been able to line up asn board candidates' Sir Ian MacGre- gor, former chair- man of British Coal and Britishi Steel, and Ms Bar-; bara Thomas, a: former US Securi- ties and Exchange Commissioner. Mr Kohn said he only: met Sir Ian four months ago through a mutual Friend. Ms Thomas was an acquaintance from. Bankers Trust where, between 1986 and 1988, he headed their Swiss-based corporate finance dan-'tment-. Sir Ian says he has thrown his support behind the group partly because he had heard of Mr Kohn's reputation as a deal-maker in corporate finance. But mostly he did so because \"Mr Kohn is the guy who identified for a large number of investors the problems at the company and its management\". That sentiment is echoed by several of Holmes' largest institutional shareholders who had watched the company's share price slide to %p last May from a high of about 190p. -15 teloi -10 2 -4 -0 .:- *15 -40 -0l Mr Kohn's latest assault on IIolmes Protection's board began at its annual general meeting in London in June when he announced that a group of inves- tors backing him had purchased a 14.7 per cent stake in the com- pany. That stake had been held by Tyco Investments - formerly Australia-based Wormald Inter- national. The total holding of the group backing Mr Kohn consists of 27.2 per cent of the company. It consists of Scottish Amicable, the French-based insurer AGF, a Swiss investor, Mr Pierre Besuch- etand, and three other share- holder groups who Mr Kohn declines to identify. Mr MacGre- gor also has a small holding or 200,000 shares. But Mr Kohn's involvement with Holmes began much earlier. In spring of 1989, Mr Kohn said, Wormald retained him to help sell their stake in the company. Wormald, concerned about Holmes' performance, sought a representative on its board and asked the directors to accept Mr Kohn. Mr Kohn says he took his non-executive directorship very seriously. Acting as a self-ap- pointed corporate gadfly, he began questioning a variety of the company's activi- ties, including its method of accounting. He eventually came to head the board's audit com- mittee. He objected loudly to the way the com- pany remunerated its executives, paying out mil- lions of dollars in severance pay to several who have been sacked over the past few years. He also says he asked executives to fly club class, rather than first class. The company's own records show Mr Kohn was oai nearly $200,000 E118,343) for director's fees and expenses in the period until November 1990. Of that, $58,000 was paid in fees to Barons while another $45,000 was for airline ickets. According to Mr John Flack, he company's current chief exec- itive, the board found Mr Kohn's abrasive manner impossible to work with. Mr Kohn says the other directors regarded him as a nuisance because he so often pointed out their errors. For this, Mr Kohn apparently won the admiration of several key institutions who say his warnings often proved correct. For instance, he warned that asset sales as part of a loan restructuring agreement were too ambitious. Also, he warned that a prospective purchaser of a sub- sidiary did not have the funds to pay for it. However, according to Mr Flack, Mr Kohn proved so disrup- tive that Wormald was asked to replace him on the board, which it did in October 1990. By the time Mr Kohn left, Holmes had found a chairman who had the support of the institutional share- holders, Mr Thomas Mayer, of Thorn EML After Mr Kohn left the board, the company's fortunes went from bad to worse. It is currently in default on about $64m in debts and is asking shareholders tc approve a restructuring that requires the sale of all businesses except the New York-based oper- ation. It will also give lenders a 33 per cent stake in Holmes in exchange for a write-off of $20m in debt. Last week it reported a sharp drop in turnover for the first six months of this year and a net loss for the period and said customers were still cancelling contracts. Yesterday it said it had incurred after-tax losses of 2p per share for the six months ended June 30, compared with year-ago earnings of 4p per share. However, if 1990 earnings are adjusted to reflect the sale of two subsidiaries, earnings would have been nil per share. The pre tax loss, which included a $500,000 severance payment to the company's former joint chief executive, was $1.39m compared with a year-ago profit of $308,000. M r Kohn concedes that he has no formal business plan to reverse the for tunes of Holmes other than a promise to achieve better terms from lenders and to improve mar kdting efforts. Institutions, while- saying they believe that Mr Mayer is on the right track, criti cise him for failing to come to grips with the company's prob- lems quickly. For his part, Mr Mayer con cedes that \"with hindsight,\" he should have kept in touch with institutions more closely.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston ASDA, the supermarket group, is planning to raise around Â£300m through a rights issue, which it hopes to launch later this week. However, the share issue has been put in jeopardy by reports in the weekend press of its plans to raise the funds. Asda's share price is likely to fall once again today, having dropped 31 per cent last week to 70p, which will make it increas- ingly difficult to persuade invest- ment institutions to underwrite the issue. The shares are 45p above their par value. An issue of shares at less than par value presents technical diffi- culties. However, a floor for the price is provided by speculation that the company will face a takeover bid. At the end of the week, there were big purchases of Asda shares by the US investment bank, Goldman Sachs. Asda's financial advisers, the merchant bank S. G. Warburg and the stockbrokers Cazenove, will decide today whether a rights issue is practicable. Asda is under pressure to reduce its debt of Â£900m. Its lat- est accounts showed that Â£460m is repayable within one year. The company, which has not yet filled its vacant post of chief executive, also needs funds to refurbish and modernise many of its stores. Unlike its bigger supermarket rivals, Asda's profits are being squeezed severely. After a gloomy statement by Sir Godfrey Messervy, Asda's chairman, at the company's annual meeting last week, bro- kers slashed their forecasts of its profits in the current year from around Â£160m before tax to less than Â£100m.",

   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan HAWKER SIDDELEY, the UK engineering group which is fighting a Â£1.5bn hostile bid from BTR, is close to selling its rail division. Negotiations over disposals in several non-core sectors of the business are well-ad vanced, according to a source close to the company. Several disposals, each totalling over 100m, could be completed in the next few weeks. One of the disposals under negotiation is therail division with annual sales of over Â£220m and profits of Â£13.6m in its last financial year. Other disposals are expected to be in the general engineering area. If they are completed quickly, this would go some way to scotching criticism of Mr Alan Watkins, chief executive, for failing to make sufficient head- way in a much-needed restruct- uring of the company, which he joined from Lucas Indus- tries in 1989. The five year plan he was to implement after the company's poor performance during the 1980s, was interrupted when the recession hit Hawker's dis- posal programme. Mr Watkins said on Friday that he was \"not about to drop this pro- gramme half-way through.\" However, BTR criticised the current Hawker management for failing to \"unlock Hawker Siddeley's potential,\" adding that there was little prospect of the management so doing in future. \"Hawker Siddeley shareholders have endured their company's under-perfor- mance for a decade\", said Sir Owen Green, chairman of. BTR when the bid was launched on Friday. Meanwhile, speculation that a further bidder might enter the fray - either another hostile bidder, or a friendly \"white knight\" - continued during the weekend. Sources close to Hawker said that a couple of continental European companies, with which Hawker has existing commercial arrangements, were \"obviously interested\" in the company. Alan Watkins: current plans may scotch BTR's offer values Hawker at 727p, and includes a full cash alternative of 700p a share. Hawkers share price jumped 118p to 758p on Friday. BTR is one of a number or large conglomerates to bid for companies last week. Hanson agreed to buy Beazer, the inter- national building materials group, last Monday. A day later, another conglomerate, Williams Holdings made a hos- tile bid for Racal Electronics, the data communications and security group."

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan MR LI KA-Shing, the Hong Kong businessman who controls the Cheung Kong property development group, is understood to have made a preliminary approach to Rosehaugh and Stanhope, the two UK property companies currently dis- cussing merger terms. The merger talks have become bogged down in discussion of detail, after earlier hopes that they could be completed by September 13. Mr Ka-Shing is understood only to be interested in investing in a merged company, rather than in either of the individual groups. The two companies announced that they were considering a merger in July, having previously been linked via a joint venture to develop the Broadgate centre in the City of London. The collapse of the UK property market has badly ailected both'companies, whose combined gross debts have been estimated at Â£1.5bn. Progress in the talks has been complicated by a clash of personalities between the chief executives, Mr Godfrey Bradman of Rosehaugh and Mr Stuart Lip- ton of Stanhope and by the involvement of Olympia & York, the Canadian property company, which has a stake in both groups. Mr Bradman is unlikely to have an exec- utive role in the merged company. The interest of Mr Li Ka-Shing is still at a very early stage, and it is not clear whether he wants merely to take a stake or to take control of the merged company. However, the presence of an investor will- ing to inject cash might help the merger talks progress.",

The purchase will boost Dewhirst's almost negligible presence in the ladieswear sec- tor. The acquisition will also increase the proportion of Dewhirst's clothing sales going to Marks and Spencer from 78 per cent to about 84 per cent. \"We are pleased with the acquisition,\" said Mr Timothy Dewhirst, chief executive. \"It will make us a major player in all three areas - menswear, childrenswear and ladieswear.\" The group will pay Coats Viyella Â£9.4m cash and assume Slimma's Â£4.7m debt, repre- senting a multiple of 11.9 times earnings. The acquisition will be paid for through funds from the issue and increased debt. Bor- rowings, which were nil at the year-end, will rise to Â£6.4m. In the year to January 31, Slimma made pre-tax profits of Â£1.8m on turnover of Â£37.9m. Mr Dewhirst said the acquisi- tion would not dilute earnings this year or next. The one-for-three rights issue at 26p will bring the Dewhirst family's stake down from 38.3 per cent to about 30 per cent. Debt, which was nil at the year end, will rise to Â£6.4m.

He added that the sell-off pro. gramme continued to be suc- cessful despite a depressed US market. MCC plans to announce additional disposals in the near future as part of a demer- ger of US assets to enhance shareholder value. Possible candidates include the 56 per cent stake in the language school, Berlitz, and MCC's Collier encyclopaedia businesses. The US operations - which include publishing house Mac- millan - will be floated off, leaving a much smaller UK business. US activities account for 70 per cent of the group's assets and 90 per cent of operating profits. An MCC spokesman said the reference division had been a very small part of US interests. MCC is committed to repay- ing its bankers $750m by Octo- ber 1992. Mr Maxwell said recently the group would pay that tranche ahead of sched- ule. A further $1.06bn is due to be repaid in October 1994. Earlier this year, MCC raised Â£446m through the sale of Pergamon, the UK scientific publisher, to Dutch publishing group, Elsevier. MCC acquired Prentice Hall, which publishes reference books for lawyers, accountants and human resource special- ists, in 1989 for $40m. In the year to March 31, the business made an operating loss of $3.5m on turnover of $54m.

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hoolliner WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate which last week launched a hostile Â£701m bid for Racal Electron- ics, said yesterday that it was in advanced talks on buying the US fire protection arm of Rockwell, the California elec- tronics and aerospace group. The deal, which would be worth between $50m and $60m (Â£35m) in cash, is expected to be signed within the next two weeks. A company spokesman said Fire Eye, which makes heat controls for industrial boilers, was a natural fit into Williams' existing businesses. He added that Fire Eye was a market leader in the US. The acquisition would have a negligible effect on turnover, the company said Last year Fire Eye made profits of about Â£6m. About 40 per cent of Wil- liams sales are in the US, and the latest acquisition is part of the company's on-going strat- egy of expanding share in that country. \"It is a strong market place,\" the spokesman said. The news came as Racal Electronics maintained a firm silence on the hostile Williams bid. A spokesperson for Racal denied the group was consider- ing a management buyout at this stage. Speculation has cen- tred on other possible defences, such as the sale of Chubb, Racal's locks business. Williams said yesterday that it was not considering increas- ing its Â£701m all-paper bid. \"We have put our offer on the table and it stands,\" the spokesman said. The ball was now in Racal's court, he added. Williams was not aware of any potential rivals for Racal. The company has offered three of its shares for 20 Racal Electronics. News of the bid pushed Williams shares down 32%p to 336%p, making the offer worth 50.45p. Racal shares closed 11% higher on Friday at 56/%p. Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal chairman, is expected is expec- ted to present the group's defence document within the next two weeks. The group demerged from its cellular tele- phones business, Vodaphone, just days before the Williams offer.",

NHL estimates that it has to pay a premium of between three and five basis points fol- lowing the liquidity squeeze, which was caused when depos- itors withdrew funds. Banks involved in the deal said that the pricing was fair and that there were no special problems in selling the bonds. However, the rising number of defaults in the UK housing market has caused some inves- tors to desert the sterling mort- gage-backed bond market. Investors are protected from defaults on the underlying mortgages by a separate tranche of subordinated notes soldalongside the main body of the issue. Any losses on the mortgage portfolio are absorbed by the holders of the subordinated notes. The issue has been rated double-A by Standard & Poor's, the US rat- ing agency. The deal frees around Â£20m of capital against which NHL can make new loans. Around Â£60m of old mort- gages from two earlier mort- gage-backed bond issues - launched through the special purpose vehicles CMS 2 and CMS 3 - have been incorpo- rated into this new deal and the old bonds have been retired. NHL said that the old issues, launched in 1986 at the very start of the sterling mortgage- backed bond market, were no longer an efficient use of capi- tal.",

   "text_content" : "By Haig Simonian in Milan NET PROFITS at Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, fell by 5 per cent to L220.4bn ($170.2m) in 1990-91, largely due to a L12lbn surge in write-downs on securities holdings and transfers to spe- cial reserves for capital losses. Overall, the bank made transfers and write-downs of L213.4bn, against L93.1bn the previous year. Despite the write-downs, the dividend is being held at L200 a share. Gross of all transfers, earn- ings amounted to L433.8bn in 1990-91, against L325.2bn. The bank revealed a 31 per cent rise in the value of its holdings in other companies. It is believed the bank has been building up its position in Generali, Italy's leading insurer, in which it formerly had a stake of around 6 per cent. Lending remained broadly stable at L12,881bn, despite this year's downturn in the Italian economy. Funding, which derives mainly from certifi- cates of deposits and bond issues, rose by 6.5 per cent to L16,675bn. The bank announced that Mr Cesare Romiti, the managing director of Flat, would be join- ing its board following the con- ferment of a lifetime senator- ship on Mr Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman. Under Italian law, Mr Agnelli, who has already stepped down from the board of Credito Italiano, must give up his position at any financial institutions where he holds a directorship as a result of his new political position. * The Italian treasury has confirmed that the first batch of applications for repayment of withholding tax on govern- ment bonds for eligible non- residents had been processed. Reports of the repayments under the accelerated proce- dure caused a surge in trading on the screen-based primary dealers system.",

The index consists of 100 non-UK European stocks, and is designed to allow investors to modify their exposure to Europe. Average daily volume in the future, a paltry 44 contracts in July, slipped further in August to 10 contracts, as liquidity dried up. Liffe and LTOM are due to join forces at the end of the year, and the Eurotrack futures and options represent the first joint product venture by the two exchanges in the lead-up to the merger. Although Liffe claims there has been interest from UK fund managers, the poor liquid- ity of the contract has meant many orders have not been met. \"There's little trading busi- ness to take the other side of those orders.\" a trader said.",

The company also noted that the zinc price had fallen some 28 per cent during the period. Acec-UM also faced a fall-off n dividends from minority shareholdings, and increased financial charges. These were caused mainly by its absorp- tion of the SGB subsidiary Sibeka - an additional BFr249m loss - and acquisi- tion of a 22.5 per cent stake in the privatised Cananea codpper mine in Mexico.

Representatives of the Bank of England, the gilt-edged mar- ket and other government bond markets are due to attend a forum in a few months to discuss whether there is a case for restructuring the gilt mar- ket to improve its attractions to investors, both foreign and domestic. To be fair, the Bank has introduced improvements already. It has issued more of the 10 per cent Treasury stock due 2001 to provide a liquid 10-year benchmark gilt, follow- ing the example of Spain and Italy, where the issue of 10- year government bonds has helped to attract foreign inves- tors. The Bank has issued short-dated gilts for swap pur- poses, and is likely to issue a 25\"30 year gilt - perhaps when yields have fallen further - to meet the demands of certain pension and insurance funds for long-dated stock. So where are the improve- ments needed? * The establishment of a repur- chase (or bond-lending) market in gilts. The repo business is well established in the US - it allows traders to borrow bonds while providing the lenders of the bonds with the opportunity to enhance the returns on their bond portfolios. However, with gilts, lenders and borrowers cannot simply match their requirements through a broker as they can for other government bonds. Instead, the bond-lender has to use a stock exchange money broker who in turn lends the stock to a gilt-edged market- maker (GEMM). Traders are keen to improve liquidity by setting up a formal repo mar- ket in gilts. *The introduction of an auc- tion calendar. Gilt-edged mar- ket makers remain divided over whether the Bank should follow the example of markets such as the US and France to announce an auction calendar. While some GEMMs believe it would be more convenient to know in advance when gilt auctions will be held, the Bank is reluctant to limit its flexibil- ity. It prefers to be able to announce auctions and taps when it feels the market condi- tions are favourable, so the government can raise money as cheaply as possible. It has, however, bowed to pressure to reduce the notice period before an auction from one month to 19 days. The next auction is due on September 25. *Allow foreign investors to hold their gilts in Euroclear or Cedel, the two Eurobond clear- UK gtlls vieds Restaed attr %) 9.( 9.4 9.4 9.2 Scoue: wafug Sesaui ing houses, which already deal with other government bonds. Some traders claim that Swiss investors, who find it conve- nient to hold their bonds in Euroclear or Cedel, are put off investing in gilts because they cannot be held in that way. a Simplify the reclamation of withholding tax. Double taxation agreements between the UK and a range of other countries allows many foreign investors to reclaim the withholding tax on their cou- pons. Otherwise, they can receive dividends gross by investing in certain Fotra (Free of Tax for Residents Abroad) stocks, or bearer bonds. The necessary form-filling is, in the words of one trader \"a bureau- cratic bore,\" but unlikely to deter foreigners from partici- pating in the gilt market. However, traders point out that European mutual funds which Invest on behalf of Indi- viduals must prove that the individual investors are non- resident in order to receive gilt coupons gross - an Impossile task with the result that such funds either forego reclaiming the tax or avoid gilts. Foreigners have been aggres- sive buyers of gilts in the first six months of this year, pur- chasing an estimated Â£3.6bn worth, while domestic inves- tors bought Â£960m. By con- trast, in July, domestic inves- tors bought Â£1.8bn while foreigners sold Â£328m. Traders emphasise the importance of foreign investors in the UK government bond market, especially when UK institutions' holdings in bonds are at an all-time low. In 1978, UK pension funds invested 29 per cent of their portfolios in UK fixed interest, compared with 4 per cent in 1990. How- ever, fixed income analysts believe that as we enter a low- inflation era - thanks to mem- bership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System - UK insti- tutions will steadily increase their weightings in bonds.

   "text_content" : "SWEDISH bond yields reached a historic low last week, despite residual political uncer- tainty. Following elections a week ago, Mr Carl Bildt, the Conservative leader, was asked to try to form a new govern- ment. He will report to the speaker on Tuesday. The market has remained confident that a new govern- ment will be formed, most likely through a four-party, or a two-party, coalition. Consequently, investors who had refrained from buying ahead of the election returned to the market last week. The yield on the 10-year Swedish government bond fell from 10.32 per cent on Monday to 9.94 per cent at Friday's close. The yield spread of Swedish bonds relative to the German bond market narrowed to its tightest level to date. The 10- year yield spread has fallen to 182 basis points, from 317 basis points last March. The long rally in the Swed- ish bond market started in May, when the krona was linked to the Ecu. The move substantially reduced currency risk for other European inves- tors, who began to switch out of other markets, such as the poorly-performing bund mar- ket. Although the link does not have the direct support of European central banks in the European Monetary System, Swedish politicians have rejected devaluation. The switch was encouraged by Sweden's slide into reces- sion. Sweden is currently experiencing negative eco- nomic growth. Inflation, which stands at 8.4 per cent, is expected to fall; some traders are looking for an inflation rate of 4 per cent in February. However some analysts are starting to question how long the bullish mood of the Swed- ish bond market can persist, and are advising clients to take profits. It is time to switch into another Ecu-linked currency, according to Mr Neil Rogers, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew. He suggests the Finnish market. Some dealers say the obvious switch is into Danish kroner bonds, where yields are just over 9 per cent, but infla- tion is just above 2 per cent. Meanwhile, the Swedish bond yield curve, which became more inverted last week, could invert further. The market is awaiting SKr4bn of paper maturing in 1995 this week. Given the potential vul- nerability of the market, deal- ers may be loath to take a lot of new paper on their books, and prices at that area of the yield curve could come under pressure, pushing up yields. Last week, there were sev- eral attempts to break the psy- chologically important 10 per cent yield barrier in the Swed- ish market, before the 10-year yield was pushed just below that level. Many traders, however, do not believe the market can hold below that level. Retail investors may well steer clear of yields which are no longer double-digit. But while some believe the market has now overstretched itself, others say the next yield level target is 9% per cent. Tracy Corrigan"

   "text_content" : "UNCERTAINTY about the strength of the US recovery and the Federal Reserve's recent cut in short-term inter- est rates led bond market investors to move toward lon- ger-term Treasury securities last week. The result to a slight steep- ening of the yield curve, with the spread between yields on seven- and 30-year paper now 52 basis points, and price gains concentrated in the long end of the market. The yield on seven-year paper was 7.37 per cent on Fri- day, compared with 7.69 per cent a month ago. As investors shifted to the longer maturities the yield on the benchmark 30- year Treasury bond closed at 7.89 per cent, down from a level of 8.13 per cent four weeks ago. The focus of investor specu- lation remains whether or not the Fed will follow up its Sep- tember 13 half-point reduction in the discount rate and quar- ter-point cut in Fed funds with another cut in rates. The main consideration con- tinues to be how the Fed will react to the weak state of mon- etary growth - and especially to the M2 rate, which dropped by $9.7bn in the week ended September 2 and rose by $2.6bn in the week to September 9, below the anticipated rise of $3.4bn. Market watchers at James Capel believe there is limited further downside potential for US rates; they even go so far as to describe the 5 per cent dis- count rate as \"the low point in the current cycle\".

Money supply: In the week ended September 9. Ml fell by S0.4bn to3$86.7bn H il l ge a s which considers the September 13 cut to be probably \"the last ease in this cycle\". These views notwithstand- ing, market sentiment was influenced late last week by a US newspaper report suggest- ing that continued weakness in money supply growth could induce the Fed to cut rates once more. The knee-jerk reac- tion was that some investors shifted funds to longer-term maturities. Apart from the money sup- ply debate, there was little macro-economic information to inspire the data-driven Trea- sury bond market, so attention shifted again to the frequently myopic debate over the rela- tive strength or weakness of the recovery. The debate has data-hungry bond-traders try- ing to read long-term trends into every statistic that slickers on to their monitors, while pro- nouncements from Washington put the best gloss on the same numbers. One year ago the most pessi mistic observers began speak- ing of an extended 12 to 15 month recession, and warned there was no quick fix for the debt-laden US economy. At the same time, the Fed declined to acknowledge that a recession now thought to have begun in July 1990 - was even under way. Six months ago Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, joined most Bush Administra- lion politicians in the view that the recession would be short and shallow. Recovery was proclaimed as soon as it was decently possible, with a few slight upturns in housing and consumer spending figures seized upon as evidence that all would soon be well. The pessimists - who have been more right than wrong have insisted on the \"double dip\" thesis and warned that the US economy remains far more sluggish than thought. lecent Fed actions seem to sustain this argument. As Smith Barney pointed out last week, the economic back- drop has been quite disarming in the July-September period. \"We see no meaningful change in the economic backdrop in the near term,\" Smith Barney said, noting that consumer spending was still weak and everything pointed at a weak holiday season. Put another way, it appears that cuts in short-term interest rates may not represent a panacea for the US economy, even if they take some pres- sure off the debt-servicing costs of corporate America. Wealthier Americans are los- ing interest income and middle class households are finding that the money market rate cuts have not been passed on to them in the form of lower borrowing rates, either at banks or from credit card com- panies. Mr John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, delivered another dose of reality on Friday when he said the depressed market in commercial real estate could last for at least two, and as much as the next five to seven years. Loan loss provisions and write-offs would continue to bedevil the balance sheets of banks and insurance compa- nies for a long time to come, said the chairman of America's biggest bank. The US economy is thus con- tinuing to underperform, com- pared with expectations. The coming third-quarter corporate results season is likely to con- firm this once again. Alan Friedman",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-23",
   "text_content" : "THE recent spate of takeover bids in the UK has raised hopes of increased activity in the syndicated loans market, as bankers wonder whether the bidding companies will turn to the credit market to fund their acquisitions. The Â£1.5bn bid by BTR, the industrial conglomerate, for Hawker Siddeley, the engineer- ing group, announced on Fri- day could lead to a large syndi- cated loan. BTR has offered sharehold- ers in Hawker Siddeley the choice of either cash or the combination of cash and BTR shares. According to BTR, full acceptance of the offer would involve a cash payment by BTR of \"about Â£578m\". Bankers have suggested that if BTR's bid is successful, it is likely to require a one- to two- year syndicated loan of Â£500m-Â£800m, or possibly more if BTR has to raise its bid. Bar- clays Bank, Crddit Suisse and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have agreed to provide loan finance to BTR, and would be joint arrangers for a syndicated loan.

The flotation was expected to raise about Â£500m, and Bea- zer had planned to use the pro- ceeds to reduce its debts. Instead, Hanson will inherit Beazer's Â£1.2bn debt, thereby pushing its overall debt to nearly Â£9bn, against cash of Â£7.6bn. Hanson's advisers believe that it will be in a much stronger position than Beazer to negotiate new bor rowing terms. The question is, can the mar ket expect to see more large takeover bids in the next few months and, if so, will the com- panies concerned turn to the syndicated loans market to finance their acquisitions? While some bankers believe there could be a pick-up in vol- umes in the loans market as a result, others remain doubtful, wondering whether the bidding companies may turn to the stock market for financing. The problem is that some companies are staying away from the market because they find it difficult to assess whether pricing on syndicated loans is starting to come down now. Pricing - including the margin over the London inter- bank offered rate and various fees - is two to three times higher than it was two years ago. Companies may choose to wait until pricing is on the way down before borrowing. Elsewhere, JA/Mont, the consumer tissue paper pro- ducer, has awarded the man- date for an Ecu300m syndi- cated loan to Citicorp and Swiss Bank Corporation. Ecu deals are becoming more com- mon in the syndicated loans market, although in the past the borrowers have tended to be Italian. JA/Mont is a joint venture between James River Corpora- tion, the US consumer prod- ucts and packaging group, and Montedison of Italy. It is the second largest European pro- ducer of consumer paper tissue and hygiene products. The six-year loan consists of an Ecul50m term loan facility and an Ecul50m revolving credit facility. The margin is 75 basis points over Libor with a 25 basis point commitment fee. Sara Webb",

   "text_content" : "FOLLOWING a period during the early summer when belief in European bond market con- vergence was severely tested, the faithful have been rewarded. Since late August high-yield bond markets, such as those of Spain and Italy, have rallied strongly. Bond yields have resumed the downward path towards the levels of Germany, resuming a trend which was evident for the first five months of the year. For example, Italian govern- ment bond yields have fallen by a full 50 basis points in the past month. In Spain, the fall in yields is closer to 60 basis points. Even UK government bond yields have come down by nearly 50 basis points at the 10-year maturity. Over the same period, Ger- man 10-year bund yields have come down by just 15 basis points; hence convergence of the highest-yielding European markets was proceeding at the heady pace of around 10 basis points per week. Although there are specific reasons for the bond market rallies In each country, one unifying factor has been a restorm confidence in the future of European monetary union. The Dutch plan for monetary union, unveiled this month, can take some credit for this renewed optimism. Unusually positive comments by Mr John the British prime minis ter, and Mr Hans Tletmeyer, the deputy president of the Bundesbank, have raised expectations that a formula for monetary union can be agreed later this year at the Maas. tricht summit. The Dutch plan is as yet nothing more than a \"technical paper\" - a \"non-paper\" in the language of the EC - and has yet to be approved by that country's cabinet, let alone for- mally presented to the Nether- lands' EC partners. However, is does not take much to kindle bond market enthusiasm for monetary union. In particular, the Dutch ulan has focused attention on two areas relevant to bond \"market investors. The first is that progress pYMvMad 10oyr Ecu bonds Iu s German government bonds (%) 0.4 Jan SauM Parfm CoMLal MaI 1981 owards monetary union may be through a \"hardened\" Euro pean currency unit. In this case the Ecu would maintain its characteristics as a basket currency, composed of a com- ponent part from each of the currencies which make up the European monetary system. However, it would not be allowed to devalue against other currencies in the system. In this case, the Ecu would be the strongest currency in Europe and, in theory, Ecu interest rates should be the lowest in Europe - taking over the D-Mark's anchor role within the EMS. The implication is that the yield on Ecu-denominated bonds would become the low- est in Europe. The yield on Ecu bonds has already fallen below those of French franc bonds, and the yield spread over D-Mark bonds has closed sig- nificantly. Last week the yield spread of 10-year Ecu bonds over 10-year bunds had closed to around 40 basis points. A clear example came with Republic of Finland's Ecu500m 10-year bond issue, which was launched at a yield just 20 basis points more than that available on the borrower's i-Mark bonds. Quite indepen- dently of this issue, the view of researchers at Paribas is that 20 basis points is a fair yield spread for Ecu bonds over Ger- man government bunds, taking into account the risk of devalu- ation of Ecu currencies. The Finland deal was by no means a raging success, launched into the tail end of the Ecu bond market rally and contributing to a sharp correc- tion. It also demonstrated that confidence in the Ecu sector can be fragile. These problems aside, the Dutch plan has raised the seri- ous possibility that \"hardened\" Ecu bond yields will fall to lev- els lower than German govern- ment bonds before too long. The second is that monetary union could proceed at two speeds, despite opposition from countries likely to end up in the slow lane, including Spain and Italy. It is unclear why bond mar- ket investors should take heart from this proposal. Perhaps the biggest risk in buying lire, peseta or sterling bonds is that the currencies will be devalued within the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. So far all the governments have staked considerable polit- ical capital on maintaining cur- rent parities until the next stage of monetary integration. There is an argument that their defence will be less vigor- ous if it becomes clear that they are in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe. However, so far this line of thinking has been ignored by international investors. Most have preferred to focus on the alternative argument that the high-yielding countries will redouble their efforts to con- trol inflation and bring interest rates down for fear of being left behind.

In the UK, this morning's more upbeat monthly indus- trial trends inquiry from the Confederation of British Indus- try is likely to add fuel to the current election fever. Later today, the UK current account and visible trade data for August will attract interest as the first such figures since the revisions published earlier this month in the Central Sta- tistical Office's \"Pink book\". They will also be scrutinised closely for what they tell about UK competitiveness and the domestic economy. The slight widening of the deficits, expected by the markets, could reflect the impact of reviving domestic demand on imports.

   "text_content" : "MORE very gloomy news is expected from the construction and building materials sector this week, coming hard on the heels of the depressing results and outlook presented last Thursday by RMC, the world's largest concrete producer. Tarmac, the Wolverhamp- ton-based group, will be the centre of attention when it reports tomorrow. Its involvement in materials and construction in the US and UK \"is just a nightmare,\" said one analyst. Forecasts for its interim pre- tax profits to June run from around Â£35m down, against Â£97.8m a year ago. Its comments on the current half will be closely monitored as will its high gearing and thin interest cover. Heavy involvement in poor US construction markets such as Virginia and Florida and UK house building are just two of its weak areas. Interim results of Ibstock Johnsen, the brick and tile maker, will be just just as bat- tered on Thursday. Forecasts range from a small profit to a loss against Â£22.2m pre-tax profit a year earlier. Redland, also reporting on Thursday, should be somewhat more encouraging. Underpin- ned by its foreign markets, par- ticularly Germany, it is likely to report interim pre-tax prof- its of around Â£75m (E108m). The reporting season takes something of a breather this week. FT-SE 100 stocks are thin on the ground, although a raft of medium and small com- panies are producing their esults. Among notable companies to watch for are PFG Hodgson Kenyon International, the funeral directors, today, Hays, the business services group, tomorrow, and Boddington Group, the brewer which nar- rowly failed in its bid earlier this year for Devenish, on Wednesday."

In particular, the durable goods figures are expected to disappoint hopes that consumers will lead the US out of recession. July's monthly increase of 11.2 per cent, which prompted talk of a strong recovery, will be followed by a fall of 5 per cent, according to analysts at Hoare Govett.

   "text_content" : "John Selwyn Gummer, minister of agriculture, speaks to Martin Wolf he minister is 40 min- utes late because a party of Russians is in town. Worse, Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg (recently Leningrad), is due in 20 minutes. Disposing of the problems of European agriculture so quickly turns out less absurd than one feared. Sometimes emotional, Mr Gummer has much to get off his chest, not least to the FT, with which he is \"a bit annoyed sometimes when it actually gets the facts wrong\". But the principal object of his ire is the plans of Ray MacSharry. A meeting of the farm minis- ters, to discuss the controver- sial reform proposals of the agriculture commissioner, is due today and tomorrow. Does the minister believe it will resolve outstanding issues? \"It's not going to start to,\" comes the depressing response. \"This is a long, long process. We have to get a solution that works and the present propos- als don't go anywhere near it. I should think we will be months and months.\" One of the main problems, stresses Mr Gummer, is that \"Mr MacSharry's proposals are significantly more expensive even than the present system\". Is Mr Gummer not focusing on the budgetary cost alone, how- ever, ignoring the offsetting benefits to the consumer? \"But I'm not,\" expostulates the minister. \"I've never done that at all. I'm so pleased you've come to interview me, because I'm fed up with the FT never listening to what we say. I'm talking about total resource costs. \"First of all, you have to assume that the drop in con- sumer prices will be along the lines which have been hinted at in the press. I have real wor- ries about how large that price drop will actually be.\" Moreover, the problem with the MacSharry proposals is that \"you are promising to pro- vide what is in effect a pension for a large number of people and not one that is linked with the restructuring of their farms. And, therefore, every year they will demand more. So you have got an engine for budgetary inflation. \"So what we are saying is 'of course you must have the cuts in price. We are in favour of the cuts in price'. But having got the cuts in price we are not in favour of spending that money in the way in which Mr MacSharry is proposing.\" The minister is, indeed, obsessed with the budgetary costs. But time presses. At least the minister does agree to price cutting. \"No,\" he replies, \"I don't agree. I have pioneered it.\" Mr Gummer raises his voice. \"I am sorry to be aggres- sive about it. But I am fed up with reading things in the newspaper, as if we vaguely agree with price cuts. We have campaigned for them, year in year out, very often without press support. Now that we object to the mechanisms that are used it is somehow suggested that we are not in favour of reform. That's a very sad situation to be in.\" But is he not being far too cavalier about the political need for compensation, espe- cially for the small farmers? And why does he complain so much about the discriminatory nature of these proposals, espe- cially when even the National Farmers Union has admitted that you could not operate set- asides for very small farms? \"Well let's take cereals,\" the minister responds, not even \"the most discriminatory one as far as the UK is concerned\". The plan is discriminatory in five different ways: * \"First of all, the cost of meeting the reductions deter- mined in the Gatt round would be laid on the most efficient producers.\" * Second, a mixed farm with a number of products below the ceilings gets \"a better degree of compensation than a specialist farm\". * Third, efficient farms in countries that produce grain efficiently shall have a smaller amount of acreage compen- sated than farms in less-effi- cient countries. * Fourth, why should \"a part-time farmer in Germany get compensated, whereas a full-time farmer with three families living off that farm should not have the compensa- tion? No wonder,\" he com- plains, \"I am angry\". * Finally, \"a large number of products are excluded from any reductions at all and they are all - surprise, surprise - products which are not pro- duced in this country\". And \"of course, it's true that there is a de minimis level, where it would be ridiculous to try to have set-aside. But that's a totally different thing from exempting farms which it is claimed are viable\". Yet, as Mr MacSharry says, 80 per cent of the common agri- cultural policy's benefits go to 20 per cent of the farmers. If we reform a system like that, do we not have to reduce the present discrimination in favour of the large farmer? Mr Gummer will have none of this. \"Eighty per cent of the wr price cuts year after year' e have Â·1 _ Â· Â· Â· Â·IÂ· money goes to 80 per cent of the land,\" he notes approv- ingly. \"You are starting from the distorting argument that this system is supposed to be about subsidising the number of people. That is not what the founding fathers said they wanted to do; and it is not what the CAP was about. It is not surprising that 80 per cent of the money goes to 80 per cent of the land. It's about right. PERSONAL FILE '939 Born Stockport, Chesh- ire; educated King's School, Rochester; Selwyn College, Cam- bridge 1961 BA in History 1970-74 MP for Lewisham West '983-84 Minister of State for Employment 1983- MP for Suffolk Coastal 1985-88 Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 1989- Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food \"You have to say what you are trying to do in this reform.\" First of all, he says, you are trying to halt the pro- duction increases, \"because you are moving from a time of shortage to a time of sur- plus\". Then, \"Mr MacSharry has made the curious comment that he wanted to have as many people involved in agri- culture in 20 years time as there are now\". But the British minister rejects this objective. \"I don't believe,\" he declares, \"that it is either a proper aim or one that is shared by the Community members\". The environment is \"the only justification for continu- ing support - and I'm asking for very, very significant reductions in the amount of support, though those cuts must go at a pace that it is possible to deal with in the farming community\". Even in the UK, \"80 per cent of our land area is looked after by farmers\". So what, more precisely, does Mr Gummer want, apart from the price cuts? \"First of all, I would have set-aside on a significant area. But it would have very clear environmental rules. That set-aside would have to be voluntary. But it would be targeted, in the sense that every country would have a target.\" Then there might be some kind of pension scheme for small farmers. \"I would be per- fectly prepared to see such a system, so long as it was linked with structural reorgan- isation.\" But also only \"as long as you had a system that was limited and degressive, applied to people who were 'in post' at the moment\". Is all this not deliberately unrealistic? Are these ideas not simply an invitation to a stale- mate? \"No, I don't think that that's true,\" responds the minister. \"First of all, Mr MacSharry's plans are not going to gain support.\" But do they not do more for the small farmers who concern the Spanish and the Italians, for example, than his would? \"I don't think they do,\" he asserts, \"because they do something which actually very many people in Spain and Italy don't like,\" by consigning those nations to agricultural backwardness forever. \"I haven't presented a blue- print,\" he stresses, \"because I am keen on being as flexible as possible. But I am not prepared to have the MacSharry plan, followed by an add-on package on the environment\". A note is slipped to the min- ister. Mr Sobchak has arrived. But a final question is permit- ted. Does the minister believe it is possible to reach agree- ment in the Gatt without a new EC mandate? \"I don't think that the Com- munity can actually move very far from the package that they've put forward,\" replies Mr Gummer. But \"I do believe that there are ways of making clear that the' reductions you're talking about do work their way through, particularly to export refunds and the like. \"Quite close to the deadline, the Community, the Americans and the Cairns Group will have to sit down, bash their heads together and come out with a solution. There's no other way round it. And I've always insisted that we talk as little as possible about this ludicrous concept of a 'mandate', about which there is nothing in the treaty at alL\" Britain \"supports the concept of the Commission negotiating on our behalf and coming back with the solution which we then have to accept or not accept\". Time is up, with far too many issues undebated. But as he greets Mr Sobchak, Mr Gummer, who sits in one of the hottest seats in British politics, does have one consolation: he is not the Russian minister of agriculture, nor even the mayor of St Petersburg."

   "text_content" : "IAN DAVIDSON on Europe W ith the civil war in Yugoslavia and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the European Community is at last coming to the end of its Age of Ambi- guity. For many years it was a playground of illusion, where politicians tried to deceive the voters about what it was all for, or whistled derision at the gap between illusion and real- ity. But the moment is fast arriving when they will have to come clean. During all those years. Europe's would-be statesmen disagreed violently over the Community's ultimate destina- tion: federalists confronted nationalists, free-traders con- tradicted protectionists. At the time, the battles seemed dra- matic; sometimes they even seamed serious. But with hind- sight, we can see that their quarrels were of no real come- quence, just play-acting, because the Community was still at a malleable stage o half-formed adolescence; it w=a to immature for the rival dog m:atits to mould its fiture. The crises in eastern a-d s-othern Europe have o-u the rules of the game. T Community must emerge h- its ambiguous adolesmes ecause that is what the woOd doiandas.

This initiative's only purpose was to give the illu- sion of FrancoGerman unity. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, may have felt that he struck a blow for commonsense, for Britain, and for the Conservative party, when he opposed the Franco- German proposal. Yet his gov- ernment's general attitude to the development of the Com- munity is just as two4aced as anything the French or Ger- mas can come up with. On grounds of national sov- ereignty, Britain insists that the co-ordination of foreign policy in Europe must be han- dled by Independent govern- ments, away bfrom the tols of the Commission. The French agree. But the counorton of Brtain ad Frame to assert their Interntonal stature are merely painful to the per- faomer and ridoulous to the spectator.'The arest of the world i n ltereste f there is a unted ropean famlnpol- cy; and only a 2n00 pean policy can ert infla- eace.

The responsibilities now being thrust on the Com- munity will require the mem- ber states to consider the entire panoply of state action, including security and defence. In the circumstances, the pro- posal for a peace-keeping force was misplaced, and a serious tactical error by the French. But the underlying assump- tion, that the 12 must take account of the defence-security dimension, and can only do so in a Community context, was ciarly not misplaed Moreover, this assumption evidently responds to the felt needs of an the member states.

   "text_content" : "MICHAEL PROWSE on America resident George Bush will shortly face an J. awkward choice: whether to veto CongAe-sional legislation extending benefits for the unemploye. Congress passed similar legislation in August but the White House ploited a loophole. Mr Bush signed the bill expressed sm- pathy for the jobless but faled to declare the budget emer- gency necessary if the benefits were to be funmded. The $8Sbn bill passed by the House of Representatives last week was carefully drafted to force Mr Bush to cast a veto if he wants to stop it. The Senate is expec- ted to pass similar legislation shortly. Mr Bush has exercised his presidential veto 21 times but this decision will be especially sensitive. The most tellin crit- icism he will face in seeking reelection next year is that he has focused too narrowly on foreign policy and ignored seri- ou social problems at home. Democrats see a confrontation on relief for the jobless a a way of driving this point home. \"We've helped Kurds in Tur- key. We've helped the Bangla- deshis. It's time to help Americans,\" says Mr Tom Downey, a Democrat from Long Island and the chief spon- sor of the house bill, which was passed by more than the two thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. The economy's failure to recover decisively from reces- sion only raises the stakes. The argument that new legislation is unnecessary because unem- ployment will soon fall looks threadbare: indeed, the jobless rate, already above 9 per cent in some large northern states, could drift higher. In the US, most welfare pro- grammes evoke mixed feelings. But unemployment insurance - a legacy of the Great Depres- sion - is viewed differently. People accept that individuals, however industrious, are at the mercy of economic tides that can wreck the prospects of par- ticular sectors and beach whole economies. Private insurance against such risks has never been obtainable because the bunching of claims in recessions would bankrupt commercial insurers. The case for government assistance is thus suwidely pported. uS relie, however, is unusu- ally parsimonious. The basic state benefit lasts only 26 weeks. Mr Gary Burtless, a senior economist at the Brook- nga Institution, a Washington hink-tank, points out that this compares with 52 weeks in Britain and Germany and more than two years in France. Even Japan, noted for its meagre social benefits, pays unemploy- ment insurance for 40 weeks. in most countries, when the jobless run out of insurance, t'ey move on to other benefits, uch as Britain's income sup port. The US lacks a compre- hensive safety net. Adults with dependent children may qual- ify for special means-tested benefits. But single people often find themselves witn nothing but food stamps. In theory, US workers who exhaust their regular unem- ployment insurance and live in areas of high unemployment can qu or \"extended bene- fits\" providing up to 13 addi- tional weeks of insurance. This was meant to provide a little extra help in recessions. But a tightening of eTligtity rules in the early 1960s has drastically curtailed this scheme. More than 2m workers have exhausted their unemployment insurance this year. A record 350,000 workers ran out of ben- efits in July alone. Yet extended benefits are available only in Puerto Rico and tiny Rhode Island. Ironically, the problem is not shortage of cash. Funds intended for extended benefits have accumulated in a trust fund that now stands at $8bn. It has not been drawn down mainly because the trigger for payment of extended benefits is not the actual unemploy- ment rate but the liasured unemployment rate. This s artificially low because tighter eligibility conditions and other changes have sharply reduced the poportion of workers qual- ifyg basic unemplyment insurance. The Centre on Bud- get and Policy Priorities in ashington says that on aver- age only about 40 per cent of the jo less have received unemployment benefits in recent months. The bill sponsored by Mr Downey makes the actual unemployment rate the trigger for payment of extended bene- fits and provides for a maxi- mum of 20 additional weeks of insurance when the Jobless rate exceeds 8 per cent. At present unemployment rates, six states, including Massachiu- setts and Michigan, would qualify for the 20 extra weeks; a further seven, Including New York and California, would get 15 extra weeks. By international standards, the goals of this legislation look modest. The reforms do nothing for millions who do not qualify for even the basic 26 weeks of insurance. The extensions for those that do are conditional on quite severe local economic downturns yet still leave the total duration of benefits shorter than those available at all times in most other industrialised countries. Finally the legislation does not address the social problems posed by any abrupt cut off of beneits: if the recovery does not gather momentum many workers will rapidly exhaust 46 weeks of insurance. The strongest argument against the legislation in its current form is that it falls to raise taxes to pay for the addi- tional spending and thus con- travenes the spirit of last year's Budget act. Many econo- mists hope the Senate will cor- rect this lacuna. But even if it does not, the White House will find pressure for reform hard to resist. With the jobless widely seen as innocent vic- tims of recession, Mr Bush will not want to risk the humilia- tion of an overturned veto. But if he relents, it will not mean the US is on its way to a Swed- ish-style welfare state.",
