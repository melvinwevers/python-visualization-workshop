TUESDAY Evening. The main topics of discussion in Money market circles were the first War Budget to be presented to-morrow and the possibility of a reduction in Bank Rate. The chances of a declara- tion of policy and a fall in the official minimum were considered so rosy that the banks reported a still smaller response to their demands for bills. Foreign exchange dealers again stated that turnover was moderate, but features included the official publication of forward rates and a rally in the Dutch guilder and the Belgian belga. Official forward quo- tations were also made available. Short-loan conditions remained very comfortable, and although the clearing banks adhered to their usual minimum charges for loans against bills and bonds, borrowers were able to satisfy their re- quirements in outside quarters at 2% and 2% per cent. As indicated above, the clearing banks were ready buyers of short- dated bills, October and November dates at 3 per cent. and Decembers at 3% per cent., but the market was a most unwill- ing seller. Business in \"hot\" Treasury bills was done at 3 per cent. and, in the afternoon, the effective rate appeared to be under that level. LoANs DISCOUNT PER CENT. PER CENT.

For the third consecutive day spot and forward silver were fixed at 23%d per ounce. .Of greatest interest in the foreign ex- changes was the publication of official forward rates for the first time. The U.S. dollar was called % cent premium, the Canadian dollar % cent premium and the French franc s franc discount. In the official exchanges, Dutch guilders rallied to 7.52 and Belgian belgas to 23.62y, but the Argentine free peso reacted slightly to 16.80. Among \" free\" exchanges, Italian lire weakened further to 781, but Danish kroner improved to 21 and Brazil milreis to 3%d. Official forward rates for commercial purposes on the basis of one month are as follows:- New York 1 cent premium to par; Mon- treal Y2 cent premium to par; Paris par to % franc discount; Brussels 2 cents to par; Zurich 4Y2 cents premium to par; Stock- holm 4 ore premium to par; Oslo 4% ore premium to par.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 26th Sept. A late rebound in the Stock Market offset previous dulness, and the close was firm and more active. The final list was mostly fractionally higher, with advances ranging to $2 in Rails and $1 in Steels and Motors. Turnover totalled 1,710,000 shares-480,000 more than yesterday. The opening was rather irregular, with prices chiefly lower. Some pressure was made during the morning against Steels, Motors and Coppers, but trading was very dull. Rails continued supported. Else- where, a mild improvement was not main- tained, and at midday the general list was unchanged to minor fractions below the overnight levels. In the early afternoon interest was at a low ebb owing to fears of a lengthy and acrimonious debate on the question of revision of the Neutrality Act. Buying of Rails was renewed; otherwise, moderate profit-taking reappeared and fractional losses predominated. Rails responded to favourable figures of freight car-loadings and company earn- ings. Steels were resistant despite indi- cations that the upward movement in mill activity has lost much of its influence on the Stock Market. Motors were bought on the satisfactory reception given to the new models. With Rails still very popular, the tone generally improved in the later operations, when trading became distinctly more active. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing aver- age rallied 0.90 to 153.54, Rails jumped 1.92 to the new 1939 peak of 35.73, and Utilities further improved 0.16 to 24.86. Of 897 stocks dealt in, 470 rose, 242 de- clined and 185 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Governments kept firm, while Railroads were strong. Bond sales totalled $16,920,000, against $13,520,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- her, 1931=100) was 171.8, against 171.5 yesterday. No. 1 steel scrap at Pittsburg was sold to-day at $23 per ton, an advance of 50c to the highest since the 1937 boom. The Association of American Railways has decided to undertake an immediate repair programme, including freight wagons and locomotives, costing between $75,000,000 and $100,000,000. The War Department has awarded con- tracts for Army aeroplanes totalling $58,585,000. Glenn L. Martin has re- ceived orders worth $16,125,000 and North American Aviation $13,050,000. Railroad August net earnings compared with a year ago:- Baltimore and Ohio, $2,770,000 (increase $1,133,000). Great Northern, $3,012,000 (inc. $8,000). Illinois Central, $874,000 (dec. $595,000). Lehigh Valley, $342,000 (inc. $207,000). Missouri Kansas and Texas, deficit $71,000 (deficit dec. $79,000). Missouri Pacific, $322,000 (dec. $297,000). Northern Pacific, $1,351,000 (dec. $155,000).

   "text_content" : "Slackness was the prevailing characteristic of the Stock Exchange yesterday, and as usual in such cir- cumstances price movements revealed no definite tendency. Guesses as to Russian aims in the Balkans and Germany's intentions on her north-west frontier conspired with Budget anxieties to inhibit initiative. Gilt-Edged Hopes Perhaps the most encouraging feature of the session was a stirring of dry bones in the gilt-edged market. Dealers were evidently hoping that Sir John Simon would outline to-day a policy calculated to exorcise the skeleton of minimum prices. Conversion Four and a-Half per Cent., 1940-44, closed in the ordinary way at 1018 bid, or fully i above the minimum. Special bargains at up to 104A again represented swaps against other gilt-edged stocks, which except by this openly admitted subterfuge could not have themselves been sold at their minimum quotations. Monetary Policy There is over Â£363,000,000 Conver- sion Four and a-Half in issue, so that it would be a tour-de-force were the Chancellor able to convert the stock to a lower rate of interest by its earliest redemption date, 1st July next. Much could be done to put fresh life into the Consol market by a Govern- ment restatement of adherence to its long-standing cheap money policy by a reduction of Bank Rate at a well- chosen juncture, by an appeal for patriotic support to a big new loan at not above 4 per cent.-and, if for- tune favours the Chancellor, a spot of favourable war news. Anyway some of the optimists took moderate lots yesterday of old Consols, Locals and Consol Fours from the first comers in the queue of would-be sellers that had recently formed. Yankees Resting The London market in American stocks had a bit of a rest yesterday. Mainly, no doubt, this was due to the absence of any stray overnight lead from Wall Street. Varied views ex- pressed as to the duration and precise outcome of the neutrality battle in Congress have tended to restrain bullish fervour. I was told that some members in- tentionally restricted their dealings awaiting the completion of registra- tion of foreign securities at the Bank of England. This was originally intended to take place yesterday, but not everybody noticed the official extension of the registration date, as notified in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday morning, to 9th October. A Misapprehension A more disturbing misapprehension -about which several brokers were heckled by clients-arose from the following clause in one of the cabled versions of the Neutrality Bill: \"Belligerent Governments could not sell securities in the United States.\" It is clear from other cables that all that is proposed is that belligerents should not create and offer new Government loans on the American markets. In the last war a United Kingdom Dollar Loan was a great success in the United States. But this time America is evidently not willing at present to do more than buy back its own Government and other domestic bonds and shares. (The 3tiarist",

Anticipation of to-morrow's Budget statement was the predominant factor in the Stock Exchange to-day, and pro- duced a notable change in the direction of public interest. Industrials and the speculative markets remained under the influence of taxation doubts, but investment securities as a whole gave a slightly better account of themselves. British Funds were a little less difficult to sell at the fixed minimum prices, although only small amounts could be taken by the market. Transactions officially recorded in all markets totalled 2,418, compared with 2,800 yesterday. The change of atmosphere in gilt-edged stocks was attributed to the hope that Sir John Simon's statement to-morrow may go some way towards putting the market on its feet again. It was suggested in the market that a short-dated 2% per cent. War Loan might be brought out in the near future, although it is realised that some special advantages would have to be attached to a loan at such a low rate to make it attractive. Unconfirmed talk of this kind had the effect of giving the market a slightly better atmosphere. Conversion 4% per cent. actually rose to 101% bid, a figure well away from its minimum of 100%. The short-dated character of the stock, and discussion of conversion possibilities, attracted demand, and normal markings ranged up to 101%. Special transactions, indicating that purchases had been effected at a high level in consideration of the market taking long-da;ed stock at minimum prices, were as high as 104%, although \"swapping\" business of this unconventional type was said to have been less extensive to-day. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 BOND MARKET DULL Business in Foreign Bonds was almost non-existent. Japanese bonds again pro- vided the only feature, and closing quota- tions showed that some of the recent losses in this group had been partially regained. Nevertheless the amount of stock changing hands was small and the movement reflected a slight improvement in senti- ment rather than serious buying interest. Japanese 5% per cent. Conversions made the largest movement and were 3 points higher at 42. The 4 per cent. 1910 issue put on 1 to 24% and the 4 per cent. 1899 loan regained % to close at 26%. Elsewhere small amounts of Chileans came on offer and the 4% per cent. 1886 issue was finally % lower at 13. European issues remained almost entirely unchanged. Belgian bonds were again weak. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 ELECTRIC SUPPLY issues were inactive and dull. London Associated yielded Is to 19s, as did Edmundsons to same amount. County were steady at 29s and British Powers changed at 22s 3d. Victoria Falls Powers realised 60s. Nothing of \\ interest transpired in ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS. Johnson and Phillips, lowered 2s 6d yesterday, were marked up 2s 9d to 86s 6d, and Crompton Parkinsons, on fresh buying, were 4%d. harder at 15s. British Insulated were down Is 9d and General Electries fell 9d. Some repurchasing of shares prior to the Budget on the idea no fresh imposts will be introduced gave the MOTOR group a brighter appearance. Leylands closed '/6 better at 3Y and Rovers were marked up 9d to 12s. Raleigh Holdings eased Is to 44s..on fear of a bicycle tax. AVIATION isstes were steady to fin, with Hawker Siddeleys harder at 11s 6d. No quotable changes were made in leading COM- PONENTS. Bargains from 23s to 24s were done in Dunlops and from 23s 6d to 24s 9d in Triplex Glass. Dealings at 7s 6d and 9s were reported in Tecalemits. Movements were small and irregular in SHIPPING issues. Cable and Wireless and other similar shares were scarcely mentioned. Public interest in STEEL shares was small, but where some inquiry was apparent prices turned firmer. This was notably the case with John Browns at 24s 6d and Hadfields 21s 9d. United Steels tailed off to 20s 9d and B.S.A. to 23s. COAL shares where changed were lower, par- ticularly Bolsovers at 40s 7%d and Shipley 30s. Gory were dealt in at 76s 3d. Among MANUFACTURING issues, Imnerial Chemicals further fell 9d to 25s 3d, Borax Deferred %e to 1%, British Oxygens % to 3%, British Aluminiums and Turner and Newalls Vi each and Imperial Smeltings 6d to 10s. United Molasses were sold down to 23s 9d. Lancashire Cottons were favoured in TEXTILES and rose 9d to 13s 9d. Fine Spinners Preference gained 6d to 8s. Prices in other directions were easier, with Coats 6d off at 23s 6d. Among RAYONS, British Celanese were quietly firm, with the First Preference 6d higher at 16s 6d. Courtaulds closed dull at 25s 6d. STORES were not very bright owing to the compulsory insurance of stocks and Woolworths eased Is 3d to 51s 3d. Great Universals further recovered Is to 18s. British Home Stores changed around 4s. Some of the Drapery issues were easier again. The TOBAccO group drooped in places pending the Budget. British-American shaded off M6 to 3'Ã½, and Imperials were 5' , perhaps rather sellers. Carreras \"A\" were %. easier at 5%~6. Less interest was shown in BREWERY issues, but the tendency kept firm. Benskins and Mitchells and Butlers each were about Is higher. Elsewhere, Manbre and Gartons suffered a fresh setback. International Stores were 6d lower at 11s. American Industrials were dull. Bethlehems were 117 (after 119), U.S. Steels 95 (after 962), Nickels 49% and Chryslers 106. Industrial shares prices Page 4 RUBBERS REMAIN EASY The spot quotation for raw rubber declined to-day and share quotations eased again as a result, although few shares changed hands. Parit-Bruas were a firm feature, the price rising 2s 6d to 40s. Strathmore, on the other hand, were offered and closed Is 3d cheaper at 18s 9d. A similar fall occurred in Bah Lias at 22s 6d and Stagbrook at 10s. Of the leaders, United Sua Betong finished 9d down at 46s 3d, Allied Sumatra at 15s 6d and Anglo-Dutch at 25s each being 3d lower. On the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange conditions were also dull with the com- mnditv Ruhhbr TTrust were ouoted at 27s. Tea shares on the Stock Exchange were quiet, and prices were easy, with few ex- ceptions. A small purchaser of Upper Assam raised the price Is 3d to 30s, while Budla Beta improved from 17 3d to 17s 9d. Rubber and Tea prices Page 4 OILS OUT OF FAVOUR The Oil market again was almost friendless and prices suffered a further general reaction. Yesterday's selling of Royal Dutch was not repeated from Amsterdam, but Shells were offered locally on a moderate scale and, in the present state of markets, fell back %, to 4%. Dutch remained around 38 throughout the session. Anglo-Iranians at 3s and Burmahs at 3%3 both were depressed and showed losses of Y each. British Burmahs were firm at 6s 3d. Trinidad issues were easier, Leaseholds losing /e to 4\"/i and Apex Is to 27s, and there were sharp declines in some of the recently-favoured South American stocks. Lobitos, for example, were lowered %2 to 11\"/ and Anglo-Ecuadorians 6d to 20s. Mexican Eagles were relatively steady at 4s 6d, but Canadians held at 8s lid. Rumanian shares were not noticeably affected by fears of Soviet aggression. Oil Share Prices Page 4 MORE FALLS IN KAFFIRS Sales of French Favourites Depress Prices Kaffirs were generally.depressed in tone by the pronounced dulness that overtook a number of the dividend-payers, generally recognised as being favourites among French investors. Attempted sales of these issues were linked up with reported nerrousness among French holders that further steps may be taken in France to ensure the full disclosure of foreign hold- ings. The offer of relatively small lines of stock from local sources known to have French connections soon caused a marking down of prices in the, virtual absence of support. Johannesburg remained an entirely separate entity as far as London was concerned. The largest fall was in Rand Mines, which dropped V to 7%. Union Corpora- tion lost X to 6, as did Crown to 14 and East Geduld to 10%. General Mining at 3'% and Durban Deep at 2% each gave way s. On the contrary, Anglo American rose '. to 1%. West Africans remained dull, but leclines in no instance exceeded 3d. Some lemand for Ariston arose towards the close, allowing these shares to finish unchanged at 10s 3d, after being offered at this level. Among Australasians, Bulolo vere lowered % to 4% and Blackwater A& to %. Selukwe hardened 3d to 3s 3d. Elsewhere, Oriental Cons. were still rather sellers at 2% despite the hope being exoressed that the first return ns eani;tf may be made within the next month. The amount to be received by English share- holders is estimated at 30s.. Among Rhodesian Coppers, Roan gained 3d to 17s 9d and Rhodeslap Selection also 3d to 16s 6d, but Selection Trust fell 6d further to 11s 6d and Nchanga '%. to 1%a. Tins were inclined to drift owing to the lack of fresh support. Nevertheless, Southern Malayan strengthened %, to 1%,, as did Tronoh to 3%,. Attempted French sales-as with Kaffirs-were thought to have prompted declines of % in De Beers Deferred to 4Y and in the Preferenqe ,to 7. Mining sa e.p pes Page 4",

   "text_content" : "To-day will end the suspense that has overhung Stock Exchange markets for some time past in regard to the Govern- ment's intentions concerning finance. Before war broke out, it was obvious enough that Sir John Simon would have to resort to some fresh plan to finance expenditure which, even then, had begun to mount to what the newspapers call astronomical figures. To-day's markets, like those of yester- day, will remain quiescent, awaiting the Chancellor's proposals. When these latter are known it will become less dif- ficult to assess the liability for whatever fresh taxation may be imposed. Freed from the fetters of suspense, Stock Ex- change business will be able to take stock of the new situation, and adapt its prices to correspond with the Government requirements. Business in Abeyance Experienced members of the House do not look, however, for any particular re- sumption of activity immediately after the opening of the Supplementary Budget. It will take some few days before the Chancellor's proposals sink into the mind of investment, and enable it to form some approximate judgment as to the manner in which the new taxes are likely to affect various branches of industry. Therefore until next week, no par- ticular expansion of Stock Exchange business can be reasonably expected, although anything that puts an end to suspense is, of course, a step in the right direction. Insurance Shares The recent recovery in the prices of Insurance shares will not have escaped notice by those who watch the trend of investment securities. In a letter to their clients, a firm of Stock Exchange brokers point out that, with the exception of one or two of the purely life companies-not the indus- trial life companies-dividends were maintained throughout the period of the last war. In many cases, they were in- creased in the later years of the war, and further increased after the declaration of peace. American Interests On the question of depreciation of in- vestments, the firm say that this is \" one of our reasons for insisting on shares of conservatively managed companies.\" Those that transact an extensive busi- ness in the United States should, as a result of the depreciation of the pound in terms of the dollar, experience a con- siderable appreciation in the value of their American investments. S.E. Membership Support is expressed of the sugges- tion that the Stock Exchange Managers should make generous concession to those members of the House to whom the conditions of the times have rendered their membership of no value at present.

They totalled $250,839,000 (about Â£62,710,000 at $4). This compares with $229,628,000 (Â£57,407,000) in the preceding month and $230,790,000 (Â£57,697,000) a year ago, the respective percentage increases being 9.2 and 8.7. Imports rose to $175,766,000 (about Â£43,939,000) from $168,925,000 (Â£42,231,000) and $165,516,000 (Â£41,379,000) respectively, or 4 per cent. and 6.2 per cent. higher. The favourable- trade balance was- thus $75,083,000 (Â£18,771,000), against $60,703,000 (Â£15,176,000) and $65,274,000 (Â£16,318,000) in the two comparative months. For the first eight months exports totalled $1,896,322,000 (Â£474,080,000), in contrast with $2,049,112,000 (Â£512,278,000) for January-August, 1938, and imports $1,439,186,000 (Â£359,796,000), against $1,267,280,000 (Â£316,820,000).",

   "text_content" : "The Chancellor of the Exchequer is preoccupied at this time, above all other members of the Government, with the financing of the war. He has to envisage not only the vast expendi- ture which is taking place here at home, but also the translation of a substantial part of it into terms of foreign currencies owing to our de- pendence upon countries overseas for a large proportion of our food and raw materials. For the time being the home outlays are far the easier to manage, but to-day the Chancellor will be occupied with an emergency Budget which, for the longer term, will present serious problems. With regard to foreign currencies, special arrangements were made by some of the earliest of the Defence (Finance) Regulations. Indeed, even before the war, the Treasury had taken steps to control securities, expressed as pay- able, either specifically or optionally, in certain foreign currencies and in Canadian dollars, with a view to en- suring that we should not lack re- sources abroad. At that time the authorities moved cautiously, in order to avoid as far as possible inter- ference with the normal course of business. Once the nation was at war, obliga- tion to offer to them all gold holdings and the currencies of those nations specified in connection with securities was at once imposed upon all persons resident in the United Kingdom. The point about residence is worth em- phasising once more, in view of its importance to any foreign holders who have been relying upon London for the safe custody of their gold, for in- stance, but for British owners the main significance lies in the word \" immediate,\" which Sir John Simon stressed in the House of Commons yesterday. It would have been better if the same imperative tone had been given to the original Order. In its absence some holders have been taking the line that as no date had been fixed they were entitled to keep their gold or their currencies in the expect.tion that they would obtain a better price by waiting. There was never any justification for that atti- tude, and the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer left no doubt yesterday of the duty of every citizen who is concerned by the Order. The position should have been obvious enough from the start. The Order became effective as soon as it was made, and the fact that it was the product.of such an emergency was quite sufficient to stamp it as one call- ing for immediate compliance. There is no further excuse for procrastina- tion, indulgence in which no doubt would bring penalties in its train in the long run. Many people were say- ing yesterday after the Chancellor's statement that he should have gone farther and fixed a date-which would have needed authorisation by a supplementary Order, of course-by which the laggards should have made their contribution to the country's resources available for overseas pur- chases. Further delay will invite harsh measures, and it hardly needs to be said at this stage that with- holding such essentials from the nation's war-chest is quite contrary to the spirit which is the driving-force of Britain in its conduct of the war Those guilty of it seem to have for- gotten that he gives twice who givel quickly, the principle of which is nc less applicable when, as in this case the \"giving\" is against full cash payment in sterling. re ci w si 81 A tl b a ci n n, h tl d tl T li t, cl si o: t] t. r c. ti o t: a b t I a 1 t r i r t c i t 1 I c I I I i I 1 1",

   "text_content" : "Like many other concerns engaged in specialised forms of engineering, Horseley Bridge and Thomas Piggott, of Tipton, Staffs, experienced a high degree of activity last year. The busi- ness of constructional engineers and ironfounders, which was registered as a public concern in 1873, is devoted more particularly to the construction of bridges, jetties, cranes, gas and steel works plant and the like. Good progress has been made since recon- struction in 1935, Last year, trading profit advanced by Â£19,200, or 22 per cent., to Â£105,800, but the advantage was not reflected in the net figure, which was Â£5,300 down at Â£55,200, owing to additional provision for taxa- tion and depreciation amounting to nearly Â£25,000. In the circumstances the increase in the Ordinary dividend to 124 per cent., against 10 per cent. for each of the two preceding years, appears justified by the general situation. The some- what smaller disposable balance is applied as to Â£10,000 to reserve, making Â£100,000, while Â£10,000 is carried to A.R.P. expenditure and Â£5,000 to staff pensions, leaving Â£13,600, against Â£7,200, to be carried forward. A year ago the substantial sum of Â£40,000 was put to reserve. The balance-sheet discloses a further increase of Â£3,900 to Â£643,300 in work in progress on which no profit has been taken in the present accounts, and the figure for debtors is substan- tantially higher. The prospect is thus for a satisfactory result for the current period.",

From the point of view of the shareholders the salient feature of the speech is the assurance that, pending a return to normal conditions, the Government has agreed that the Corporation will be enabled'to continue its operations on a basis which will give a reason- able return on the capital. The Cor- poration will come under the regula- tion of the Ministry of Food as the responsible authority for dealing with its financial relations with the Govern- ment under a war-time regime, and in this relation its position as a provider of home-grown sugar assumes a new importance. Even before the war the need for a thorough overhaul of the Sugar Act had already become apparent, and had been the subject of prolonged dis- cussions. The rate of Government assistance is based on a forecast which assumes normal conditions, which have not been realised either in respect of the basic acreage, or, as the experience of the past year has shown, by results when weather or other con- ditions have been abnormal. Assist- ance for the current year was based on a peace-time calculation, but it has been recognised that additional ex- penditure arising from war costs will have to be taken into account. The question of amending legislation will now have to remain until after the war, but meanwhile the position of shareholders is assured.",

   "text_content" : "\"'FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL In view of the comments in these notes yesterday and on other occasions recently on the subject of the surrender of foreign currencies, gold coin and bullion, the statement by Sir John Simon in the House of Commons yester- day is of interest. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made it plain that no delay is to be permitted in surrendering and that failure to comply with the regulations may entail heavy penalties. It is, of course, most desirable in the national interest that the Treasury should receive the full amounts available. It is a pity, perhaps, that the Chan- cellor did not name a specific date by which surrenders should be made and specific penalties for non-compliance. After all, three weeks have elapsed since the Treasury regulations were issued, but it is obvious that firms, companies and individuals are still holding back. Foreign Notes Meantime, from correspondence re- ceived, it would appear that British nationals who have surrendered foreign notes are under the impression that they have been mulct by the banks to whom they have taken them. The trouble has arisen because of the difference between the exchange rate they have been offered and the official Telegraphic Transfer quotations pub- lished each day. For example, one or two correspondents in the country have complained at the rate given of $4.12 for U.S. dollar notes, whereas the official dollar buying rate is $4.04. This difference is due to the fact that there is a very high insurance charge for the shipment of notes back to the United States. In all cases, the quota- tions for notes are higher than T.T. rates. Forward Quotations An indication that the foreign ex- change market is gradually getting back to normal wau the publication yesterday of official forward rates for the first time since the war began. There have been forward rates avail- able for some days, but they have not been actually issued by the authorities through the recognised official channels. With the exception of that for the French franc, all the quotations were at a premium over the official spot rates. These forward rates are for commercial purposes only.",

   "text_content" : "Mr. Eric Miller gave his customary detailed review of the tea and rubber industries at yesterday's meeting of Harrisons and Crosfield, in which com- modities that successful company is so largely interested. Bonded tea stocks and imports into this country are now under control of the Government, but Mr. Miller pointed out that it is most important that countries like the United States, Canada and Australia should be able to obtain normal supplies direct from the East. There can be no question, he emphasised, of any short- age of tea, as producing capacity is still much greater than any possible con- sumptive demand. No attempt was made by Mr. Miller to assess the probable effects of the war on the rubber industry. There are several factors to be reckoned with. German imports averaging 110,000 tons per annum during the last two years and those of Poland amounting to nearly 8,000 tons in 1938 will have to be left out of the picture. Neutral countries will presumably take less, but elsewhere war needs are likely to call for larger quantities of the commodity. Further, the United States, where stocks are low, has been absorbing rubber at a satis- factory rate, and its automobile output will show a substantial increase this year.",

The importance of a conservative dividend policy, which may be regarded as one of the universal factors, was stressed by Mr. F. C. Hunter, chairman of Manvers Main Collieries, at yesterday's meet- ing. Nevertheless, the company did well enough during the past year to justify a small increase in the divi- dend, especially in view of the fact that the Barnboro' No. 5 pit was only reopened for work early in November after having been closed since May, 1938. Scheduled output was attained early in the present year. The question of amalgamation is one of considerable interest, but so far as the company is concerned it has not yet been possible to formulate any acceptable proposals although the matter has been extensively examined during the past few years. In a memorandum issued by the Coal Com- mission in June the industry was in- vited to co-operate in the preparation of schemes, but no suggestions were made in regard t6 certain of the larger colliery companies;,including Manvers Main. The company is thus presum- ably outside the range of potential amalgamations for the time being.",

   "text_content" : "FRENCH TRADE CREDITS PARIS, 26th Sept. Extensive war-time credit facilities will be granted to commercial organisations by the Bank of France, states the Ministry of Commerce. Evacuated firms and those whose plant, etc., has been requisitioned are among the special cases to be con- sidered. In view of these facilities, adds the Ministry, the normal system of credit trading must not be abolished in favour of cash payments.-Ex. Tel. SIR FRANK BOWATER The King has approved that the dignity of a baronetcy be conferred upon Sir Frank Bowater on his retirement from the office of Lord Mayor of London and that knight- hoods be conferred upon Alderman George Godfrey Warr and Mr. Frederick Rowland on the occasion of their retirement as Sheriffs of the City. BEQUEST TO THE NATION About Â£67,000 has been bequeathed for the reduction of the National Debt in the will of Mr. John Ingolby Ingold, of Framp- ton, nr. Boston, Lines, who died on 19th April in his 85th year. He left Â£88,344, estate duty being Â£17,792. After various bequests totalling Â£1,700 he left the residue of his property to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in reduction of the National Debt. MR. CLIFFORD FIGG The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, has invited Mr. Clifford Figg to be his honorary business adviser for the period of the war. Mr. Figg is chairman of a number of tea and rubber companies, including the Alliance Tea Company of Ceylon, Imperial Ceylon Tea Estates, Seremban Rubber, and is also a director of the Mercantile Bank of India. The Central Wassau Gold directors are asking shareholders to lend the company Â£5,000 in multiples of Â£1 repayable on 1st October, 1944, at a premium of 25 per cent. This sum, it is stated, would be sufficient to keep the properties on a care and main- tenance basis for four or five years.",

Corrcsponot ts kindly note that this offer does not apply to our contributor \"Autoltcus \" or \"The Diarist.\" Postal Address : 72 Coleman-street, E.C.2. Teleuramn : \" Finantimo, Are., London.\" Apiarist, Tunbridge Wells-The position dis- closed in the report is not good, and early prospects do not look at all hopeful. There is practically no market in the shares at the present time, and it is useless to attempt to sell. A. W. K., Birmingham-The concerns named are all sound, and having held on to the shares so long we think you had better continue to do so. We see no attraction in the suggested purchase. C. S. E.-Pending an announcement by the Government nothing useful can be said. and holders of the stocks can only continue to exercise patience. There is no reason to doubt that they will receive fair treatment. Day-The outlook is not very bright, but it hardly seems worth while to attempt to sell now. We presume you have registered your holding in accordance with Treasury regu- lations. Doubtful, Walton-on-Thames-All the con- cerns named are first-class, with interests widely spread. Consequently the chance of any serious loss arising from the war is very much reduced. In our opinion you should leave your money where it is. Insurance- -1. On the whole we prefer an indi- vidual share, and would select either of those mentioned by you. 2. As a lock-up the stock is hopeful, but we should say that there is no hurry to buy. Jack Straw-1. An announcement will be made in due course. At present it is impossible to say what sort of offer will be made. 2. Hold all for the present. 3. These are quite sound, but we do not think there is any hurry to purchase. Keith-1. We see little prospect of recovery in these shares, but are afraid it would be impossible to sell at the present time, and do not think it is worth while trying. 2. The Burma Corporation dividend is payable on 29th September. Nodrog-Sooner or later some recovery may occur, and we would not sell now. Much early improvement does not appear likely. Viki-We do not think there is any doubt as to the soundness of the two concerns named and would leave your money where it is.",

The fund formed will be independent of the other funds of the society. It is intended that the pool shall come into operation on 1st October.

   "text_content" : "Arrangements have been completed whereby the physical transfer across the Atlantic of certain American stocks sold by London to New York will be avoided. By this means the onerous cost of freight and war risk insurance hitherto borne by London sellers of U.S. stocks will be mitigated. As has been pointed out in THE FINANCIAL TIMES, these charges have resulted in the price obtained by sellers in London being substantially below those ruling in New York. The new plan provides that certificates of shares sold in London to American buyers can be deposited for cancellation with the London representatives of the American transfer agents. The latter will arrange by cable to have new certificates issued in America. An important feature of the scheme is that it is estimated that delivery will be accomplished within three days instead of two weeks. The charge for the service, payable in New York against delivery of the new certificates, will compare favourably with the existing charges for freight and war risk insurance. A list of American shares coming within the arrangement is expected to be issued to-day. It will include all prominent issues dealt in on the London market. Extension of these facilities to include names of com- panies the securities of which are less active in London will take place as demand may require. The plan has been developed by a committee drawn from the following banks:- Bankers Trust Company. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Chase National Bank of the City of New York. Guaranty Trust Company of New York. Morgan Grenfell and Co. National City Bank of New York. PROCEDURE FOLLOWED Forms to be Used The forms to be used may be obtained at any of the above offices. They provide that certificates should be lodged with the London representa- tives of the Transfer Agent and accompanied by the appropriate forms issued under the Defence (Finance) Regulation governing the transfer of foreign securities. The name of the transferee, who must be a member or member firm of the New 'York Stock Exchange, must be inserted in each assignment and the signature of the transferor must be guaranteed by a member or member firm of the New York Stock Exchange or by one of the desig- nated banks. The charge for the service will be as follows:- Per share Stocks selling at $10 or less ... 12% cents ,, $10 to $50 ...... 25 ,, . ,, over $50 ...... 50 The minimum charge will be $10 for each lodgment. Arbitrageurs are at present working on the basis of an inclusive shipment charge of 2% per cent. to 3 per cent. The charge for the new facilities will work out to 1% per cent. on a $10 share falling to % per cent. on a $100 share, in additioi to which there will be minor charges to be borne by the arbitrageur for commission and taxes. The scheme is expected to be widely welcomed on this side, since it will facili- tate business and will relieve sellers of possible difficulties which would arise if arbitrageurs were left bears of stock owing to securities being lost in transit.",

For- ward rates have been available for some days for certain currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and French franc, but this is a new movement towards the return to normality. The quotations, of course, are for commercial purposes only and are on the basis of one month. For example, the one month dollar is at a premium of % cent (1 cent to par) and the three months is 1/ cents over spot. The French franc is at a discount of 12Y centimes per month, but all the others are at small premiums on sterling. Lombard Street is more than ever con- vinced that a reduction in Bank Rate, if not made to-morrow, will not be long delayed.",

Members of Parliament were last night anticipating increases in taxation in many directions and the spreading of the taxa- tion net in a way that will call for sacri- fices over as wide a field as possible among all classes of the community. There was an opinion among Members associated with trade and industry that, rather than impose an immediate increase of Is in income-tax, the Chancellor may prefer a policy of gradation and impose an increase of 6d now and another 6d at the end of the current financial year. In some quarters there was talk of a graduated income-tax rising to the E.P.D. scale. The view is being accepted that death duties will be increased and that there will be a lowering of the scale at which super-tax becomes payable.",

Dealings remained a matter of difficulty, but small lines of some securities could be sold occasionally at the minimum prices fixed last month. The slight easing of the position was notable in view of the deadlock previously existing as a result of the fixed minimum quotations. Conversion Four and a-Half per Cent. actually rose above the minimum, the price being 101-101%, against a fixed price of 100g. This improvement was attributed to the attractions of the stock as a short- dated issue giving a high immediate yield. Possibilities of a conversion offer to holders in connection with war borrowing was another strengthening influence. The changed atmosphere of the gilt- edged market generally was believed to be due to anticipations of a favourable state- ment on financial policy in to-day's Budget speech.",

   "text_content" : "By our POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WESTMINSTER, Tuesday. The Chancellor of the Exchequer declared in the House of Commons to- day that no delay is permitted for the surrender of foreign currency to the Treasury. He was replying to a ques- tion as to whether there was any time limit for handing over such holdings. He emphasised the importance of prompt compliance with the regulations under which every person resident in the United Kingdom is under immediate obligation to offer forthwith for sale to the Bank of England American or Canadian dollars, French, Swiss and Belgian francs, Dutch guilders, Swediph crowns, Norwegian kroner and Argen- tine pesos. \" Every person who has not already done so,\" he said, \"should immediately give his bankers the necessary instructions. If any person has no bank and is uncertain exactly what to do any bank is in a posi- tion to advise him. The above applies both to amounts held on 2nd September and to any amount since received or which may be received in future by way of payment for exports or otherwise.\" COMPANY HOLDINGS Sir John Simon added that he must make clear that the obligation applied to private individuals as well as to firms and com- panies; they were not entitled to retain oldings in the currencies named whether for the purpose of carrying on their busi- ness or otherwise without special permis- sion. Failure to comply with this obligation might entail heavy penalties. What he had said of the' currencies in question applied equally to gold coin and bullion. He added that the regulations applied to any foreign currency which British residents controlled. As to whether they affected residents in this country irrespec- tive of whether they were British residents or not, he said the expression in the answer he prepared was \" persons resident in the United Kingdom.\" If they resided here they ought to comply with this most important regulation. STERLING AND DOLLAR The question of sterling exchange on New York was also raised by Mr. J. Wedgwood (Lab., Newcastle-under-Lyme), who asked the Chancellor if, in view of the importance of developing the export trade, he would remove the stop on the exchange. At $4.03, he said, this amounted to a tax of 7% per cent. on all exports to and a bonus of the same amounts on all imports from the United States. Sir John Simon said the question pre- sumably referred to the fact that a limited number of transactions had taken place in other countries at a different rate. He did not think the difference between the two rates, which had varied considerably but was now a matter of 1 per cent., could properly be regarded as a tax on exports as well as on imports. A further depreciation of sterling would tend to in- volve an increase on the cost of imported materials and a consequent rise in the cost of living. Questioned as to whether in connection with the fixing of the dollar and sterling exchange the Tripartite Agreement was still working, the Chancellor said he thought he was right in saying no party to *'iat agreement had suggested it was not operating.

   "text_content" : "The thirty-first ordinary general meet- ing of Harrisons and Crosfield, Ltd., was held yesterday in the Council Chamber of the Rubber Growers' Association (In- corporated), 19, Fenchurch-street, E.C. MR. H. ERIC MILLER (the chairman), in the course of his speech, said: The whole of the authorised amount of Deferred Ordinary stock has been issued. The in- crease in the shares in and advances to subsidiary companies is due mainly to the extension of our commercial interests in Canada and South Africa. Cash and Government securities stand at over Â£860,000. These liquid resources are particularly valuable in the present emergency, and their magnitude indicates that the Board have pursued a policy de- signed to protect, so far as lay in their power, the extensive interests of the business. PROFIT AND DIVIDEND The net profit for the year of Â£345,309 17s 9d shows an improvement of Â£11,439 on last year's figures. Out of this the directors have decided, purely as a precautionary measure, to transfer to a dividend equalisation reserve the sum of Â£50,000. Deducting this item and adding the amount brought forward, Â£454,712 19s is available, out of which Â£179,050 has already been distributed in dividends. The Board recommend the payment of a final dividend of 15 per cent. on the Deferred Ordinary stock, absorbing Â£75,000, making the total dividend for the year 20 per cent., and a final dividend on the Manage- ment shares, absorbing Â£36,250, after deduction of the refund of directors' re- muneration. This will leave a sum of Â£164,412 to be carried forward - an increase on last year of Â£5,009. It will be reassuring to you to know that, in spite of djfficult trading conditions, every section of the business contributed to our profits; even the China Company managed to put up a good showing. Fortunately, that company's capital and reserves are held in sterling, so they suffered no exchange loss thereon from the severe fall in the value of the Shanghai dollar. We are continuing to carry on at our head office in the City. Most of the younger male members of our staff are away on National Service, others are serv- ing part time. The staff at our Eastern offices are helping most usefully in various local services, and I would like to voice, on behalf of the Board and of all share- holders, our gratitude to one and all for their willing response to the call and to convey to them our best wishes that they may be spared to resume their normal avocations in those more peaceful times which we are all striving to bring nearer. (Applause.) A SOUND ORGANISATION The Government, with the experiences of 1914-18 in mind, attach great import- ance to maintaining a sound economic front, and in this respect we feel that the company can make a very real contribu- tion. Our interests are widespread, those devoted to the production of primary com- modities being particularly valuable at the present time. We have loyal teams at work and a sound, well-tried organisation, which is not so rigid as to sap the initia- tive of those in positions of responsibility. We do not tolerate extravagance or waste- ful expenditure-and it is a thousand pities that so much of the national effort has had to be somewhat hastily improvised by people who lack this kind of exnerience and sense of values. We will all be put to the test before our cause prevails, not least in the finaicial sense, and if waste could be stopped now, or at least moderated, the nation's staying power would be pro- portionately improved. Every individual can, and should, make a real contribution in this way. We realise that dividends which can be earned and paid to shareholders will be more than ordinarily useful in these diffi- cult times, and will do our best to keep the business going successfully. REVIEW OF THE TEA INDUSTRY The twelve months which have elapsed since our last meeting have been a period of reasonable prosperity for tea producers and one in which the fluctuation in prices was much less marked than in any of the last few years, due mainly to the increased flexibility of the control scheme. Last autumn and winter we might well have seen considerably lower prices, as stocks were then increasing rapidly, but the un- certainty of the political situation encour- aged buyers to build up their holdings, so the market kept steady. It seems rather unnecessary now to go into any detailed statistics; in February the International Tea Committee an- nounced that the permissible exports for the year beginning 1st April, 1939, would be reduced by 2% per cent. thus bringing the percentage down to 90. This decision was generally welcomed by the trade and was looked on as a wise one; had circum- stances remained normal I believe it would have kept the market on a basis giving a fair return to the producer and exacting not too high a price from the buyer. As it is, events have led to the Government requisitioning all bonded tea stocks in the country and until further notice they will take over all teas as they arrive. Merchants in this country will no longer be able to import teas on their own account, but it is most important that countries like the U.S.A., Canada, Aus- tralia, etc., all of which are useful con- sumers of tea, should be able to get normal supplies direct from the East. There can be no question of any shortage of tea, as producing capacity is still much greater than any possible consumptive demand. REVIEW OF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY During the first quarter of 1938 the exportable percentage under the Inter- national scheme stood at 70 and had to be reduced to the low figure of 45 for July to December, 1938. During 1939 the task of the International Rubber Regulation Com- mittee has been more agreeable, for it was possible to raise the percentage to 50 for the period January to June, 1939, on an appreciably higher basic quota, followed by a 60 per cent. release for July to Septem- ber, 1939. In order to furnish the addi- tional quantity required by the British Government for delivery to the United States Government under the Cotton- Rubber Barter Agreement, the exportable percentage has been raised to 70 for the last quarter of 1939. We estimate that total exports from all producing countries during 1939, subject to freight being available, will be in the neighbourhood of 970,000 tons, about 100,000 tons more than during 1938. World absorption of rubber in the first nine months of 1939 is estimated at 790,000 tons, an increase of 130,000 tons over the corresponding period of 1938, nearly the whole of which increase has been taken by the U.S.A. General conditions in the U.S.A. took a turn for the better in the second half of 1938 and their absorption of rubber has been maintained at a satis- factory rate during the past 12 months. Their automobile output Will show a sub- stantial increase during 1939 and with tyre inventories at a very moderate level the rubber factories have been kept well employed. STOCKS IN U.S.A. In view of the low level of price at which rubber could be bought during the whole of 1938 and the first eight months of 1939, it is difficult to comprehend the policy of United States manufacturers in allowing their stocks of crude rubber to decline as they have done. This policy is the more difficult to understand as the average price of standard sheet on the London market from October, 1937, to September, 1938, was 7d per pound. In no month during that period did it average 8d per pound, while in the months of April and May, 1938, the average price was actually below 6d per pound. At the end of June, 1938, U.S.A. stocks were 295,000 tons, whereas at the end of August, 1939, they were down to 160,000 tons. Some 50,000 tons of ready rubber in excess of normal working stocks were accumulated in the East by the end of 1938. The existence of these stocks was a safeguard against any \" squeeze.\" An essential part of the International Rubber Regulation Scheme, while making available all the rubber that may be re- quired, is to maintain a fair and equitable price level which will be reasonably re- munerative to efficient producers. Had the policy of United States manufacturers been to maintain stocks of crude rubber in their country at the level at which they stood at the end of 1937, the fluctuations in the exportable percentage wquld have been minimised and the industry as a whole, including themselves, would have benefited. There would also have been no occasion for the substantial premium now being paid in New York for spot and nearby rubber. DEMAND FOR RUBBER It is early days yet to attempt to assess the probable effects of the war upon the rubber industry. Germany, including Austria and Czecho-Slovakia, imported an average of 110,000 tons per annum in 1937 and 1938, and in the first seven months of 1939 her imports were 62,000 tons. Further supplies are not likely to reach her during the period of hostilities. Poland took nearly 8,000 tons in 1938, and 4,700 tons in the first six months of 1939. Neutral Continental countries will pre- sumably be strictly rationed to their own needs. Outside these countries, activities arising directly or indirectly out of the war are likely to call for more rubber. With several years' actual experience be- hind them, the International Rubber Regulation Committee should have no difficulty in fulfilling their function and safeguarding this key industry. (Hear, hear.) This is no time for long speeches, so I have endeavoured to give you in concise form the salient information about the two industries with which we are so largely concerned. The spirit throughout our organisation is of the right character to surmount whatever difficulties and obstacles may have to be faced. We all feel that this is equally true of the peoples of the Em- pire and of our Allies. When the gigantic machinery which is now in motion has been run in, the powers of evil which we are combating will be up against such mighty forces, both moral and material, that they will have to surrender, be it sooner or later. We face the future confi- dent in the rightness of our cause, and will make all the contribution we can to speeding up ultimate victory. (Applause.) The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted and a final dividend of 15 per cent. on the Deferred stock, making 20 per cent. for the year, was declared. On the motion of Mr. James Fairbairn, seconded by Mr. G. S. Townend, the auditors were reappointed. Mr. H. P. Church proposed a vote of thanks to the directors and staff of Harrisons and Crosfield, Ltd., and the associated companies, and this was seconded by Mr. W. P. Pinckney and unanimously accorded.",

It is not possible to declare a final divi- dend before the close of the financial year, and at the same time advise shareholders of the profits, as these cannot then be deter- mined. It has therefore been decided in future to postpone the declaration of the dividend until the final accounts are made up so that the profits can be announced at the same time.

   "text_content" : "The third ordinary general meeting of British Sugar Corporation, Ltd., was held yesterday at the Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych, W.C. LT. COL. SIR FRANCIS HUMPHRYS, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.B.E., C.I.E. (chair- man and a Government director of the corporation), presided. The Secretary (Sir Alfred Wood, F.C.A.) read the notice convening the meeting and especially in East Anglia, where the major portion of the sugar beet is grown, and the crop finally turned out to be almost the worst on record. The yield per acre, which was nearly 10 tons in 1936, fell from 8.24 in 1937 to 6.64 tons in 1938, while the sugar content declined from 17.03 per cent. to 16.13 per cent. It is not surprising .therefore that the forecast adopted by the Government pro- duced a rate of assistance which proved to be wholly inadequate. The trading profit fell from E672,626 to E383,312, and after deducting management expenses and making provision for income-tax, N.D.C., debenture redemption and depreciation. the profit and loss account disclosed a debit balance of E13,801. SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT ACCORDED Faced with this unpleasant predicament, your directors were obliged to approach the Government for a supplementary grant, and sanction has been obtained to an addition in the normal rate of assistance for the current year which is estimated to produce a net yield of Â£130,000. In view of this grant and the favourable prospects for the coming season, your directors feel justified in recommending the withdrawal of an equivalent sum (E130,000) from the dividend equalisation reserve, which they expect will be replaced next year, and the payment of a dividend of 4 per cent., less tax. This will involve a reduction of approximately Â£29,000 in the carry-forward and absorb the corporation's share of the economies under the incentive scheme which would ordinarily be available for a dividend in excess of the basic rate. I feel that some explanation is due to shareholders of the effect on our financial position which is likely to be produced by the war. FINANCES IN WAR TIME The financial arrangements laid down in the Sugar Act are understood by the cor- poration to mean that the calculations adopted for arriving at the rate of assist- ance should provide, as accurately as possible, by means of a forecast, a sum sufficient-after bringing the trading loss to zero and after charging the depreciation ordered by the Minister, and after allow- ing for the interest on the reserves employed in the business-to pay a basic dividend at the \" reasonable rate \" fixed by the Treasury, which, at the time of the passing of the Sugar Act, was 4 per cent. In addition to this, provision has to be made for the corporation's dues under the profit-sharing or \" incentive \" scheme. If the forecast, owing to exceptional cir- cumstances outside the corporation's con- trol, provides a sum which is insufficient to enable the corporation to pay the basic dividend of 4 per cent. without drawing on its reserves, machinery is available in paragraph 6 of the White Paper (Cmd. 5,139) for supplying the deficiency by an addition to the rate of assistance in the ensuing year or years. It is- over the application of this paragraph and the method of calculating the rate of assist- ance that prolonged discussions have taken place between the Government Depart- ments and the corporation and that a divergence of views has arisen. It had become increasingly clear to the Government Departments no less than to the corporation that the Sugar Act would need to be critically examined in the light of the experience of the past three years. For instance, the basic acreage under sugar beet assumed to be normal has not been realised and this has led to serious repercussions on the financial arrange- ments set forth in the Act. In so far as it seemed to be unlikely that this basic acreage would have been achieved under peace-time conditions, a problem arose which, it was generally felt, could only have been dealt with by amend- ing legislation. This, however, is a peace- time problem, and in virtue of the inevit- able suspension of the main provisions of the Sugar Act for the duration of the war, is not of immediate practical significance. REASONABLE RETURN ASSURED The rate of assistance prescribed for the current year has been calculated under the Sugar Act on the basis of peace-time con- ditions. It is recognised that reasonable additional expenditure arising from excep- tional war costs will have to be taken into account in arriving at a final settlement in time to be incorporated in this year's accounts. Under a war-time regime, the respon- sible authority for regulating the financial relationship of the corporation with the Government will be the Ministry of Food, and pending a return to normal conditions, The third ordinary general meeting of British Sugar Corporation, Ltd., was held yesterday at the Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych, W.C. LT. COL. SIR FRANCIS HUMPHRYS, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.B.E., C.I.E. (chair- man and a Government director of the corporation), presided. The Secretary (Sir Alfred Wood, F.C.A.) read the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors. The Chairman said: My colleagues and I wishe to express our sincere reget to the shareholders that, owing to exceptional circumstances beyond our control, we have been obliged to postpone the publication of the report and accounts for three months. I propose with your permission to take them as read. I am sure that you will wish to extend a welcome to Lord Forbes on his joining the Board. His close familiarity with agricul- tural conditions in Scotlad will e the means of strengthening our association cwith the Scottish farmers. BAD WEATHER AND CROPS In my speech last year I said that if the effects of the early drought could be over- come, the prospects for a good average crop appeared to be bright. Unhappily the weather conditions actually experienced could hardly have been more unfavourable, especially in East Anglia, where the major portion of the sugar beet is grown, and the crop finally turned out to be almost the worst on record. The yield per acre, which was nearly 10 tons in 1936, fell from 8.24 in 1937 to 6.64 tons in 1938, while the sugar content declined from 17.03 per cent. to 16.13 per cent.

The importance of an adequate supply of home-grown sugar in time of war can harly be overestimated, and the by-pro- ducts of the beet crop are no less valuable. Dried beet pulp is one of the most popular feeding stuffs in the country, and beet molasses are used for making yeast and citric acid. NATIONAL VALUE The nation has reason to be thankful for the forethought of the Government in establishing, after the experience of the last war, a home industry of such incalcul- able value on a secure basis, and I know you will desire to join me in asserting our confident faith in the growers and our workers in field and factory that they will combine to give of their best in contri- buting to the country's essential needs in this time of national emergency. I now have the pleasure of proposing that the report of the directors, the profit and loss account for the year ended 31st March, 1939, and the balance-sheet as at that date, as now submitted with the report Continued at foot of following columa Continued from preceding column of the auditors, be received, approved and adopted, and that a dividend of 4 per cent., less income-tax for the year ended 31st March, 1939, as recommended by the Board, be and is hereby declared payable on 27th September, 1939. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted. Mr. A. Palache, Mr. J. B. Talbot-Crosbie and Lord Forbes were re-elected directors and Messrs. Deloitte Plender Griffiths and Co. were reappointed auditors. A cordial vote of thanks to the Chair- man terminated the meeting.",

   "text_content" : "The forty-second annual general meet- ing of the Manvers Main Collieries, Ltd., was held yesterday in Doncaster. Mr. F. C. HUNTER (the chairman) pre- sided. Referring to the balance-sheet, the Chairman said the reserve for obsolescence and depreciation had been reduced to Â£69,089; the reserve fund had been in- creased by Â£15,000, bringing this fund up to Â£115,000. Freehold and leasehold properties, works and plant stood at Â£1,164,505-an increase of some Â£8,000 only. LIQUID POSITION Stocks on hand, at or under cost, amounted to Â£101,125, as compared with Â£73,981, the increase being mainly accounted for by extremely heavy stocks of coal and coke, as also by an increased quantum of general colliery stores. Sundry debtors at Â£144,755 showed an in- crease of some Â£35,000. The liquid posi- tion of the company could therefore be regarded as satisfactory. The profit for the year, after writing off depreciation amounting to Â£29,693 and after providing the sum of Â£5,643 in respect of income-tax and National De- fence Contribution, amounted to Â£85,436. Adding to this the balance brought for- ward from last year-Â£28,857-there re- mained available for distribution the sum of Â£114,293. The directors recommended a distribu- tion on the Ordinary shares at the rate of 6 per cent., less-tax. They further recom- mended a transfer to reserve fund of Â£25,000, bringing this fund to a total of Â£140,000, and leaving a balance to be carried forward of Â£30,293, after having provided Â£11,000 in respect of dividend on the Preference shares. In the present circumstances there was no need to stress the importance of a con- servative dividend policy. The directors, however, felt justified in recommending this small increase in dividend rate, as compared with the 5'/ per cent. paid in respect of the previous year, bearing in mind that the company's Barnboro' No. 5 pit, following a closure in May, 1938, was only reopened for work early in November, reaching scheduled outputs early during the present.year. The falling off in demand for coke had continued and, despite decreased produc- tion, stocks had accumulated. The exist- ence of such stocks, and the lower produc- tion achieved, materially affected the results of the coke oven department. Collieries, works, plant, etc.-All the company's properties had been maintained efficiently, and sundry improvements undertaken as and where necessary. SAFETY IN MINES The Royal Commission on Safety in 'Coa Mines issued its report in December. 1938. Although the Government had indicated that a new Coal Mines Act would be proceeded with for the purpose of implementing the recommendations of this Commission, it seemed probable that under present conditions some delay would be inevitable. Concluding his remarks, the Chairman said that at the present time when the coal- mining industry was operating largely under Government control, the share- holders would not expect him to make any forecasts as to the future. The industry was desired not only to maintain but also to increase outputs, and he was confident that the management and employees of their company could be relied upon to play their part. The report and accounts were adopted.",

The turnover, it is stated, increased, thus con- stituting a further record. Net profit was Â£55,205 (against Â£60,476), after crediting investment and other income.

SOUTHERN CROSS GOLD DEVELOP- MENT LTD. (in liquidation) DIVIDENDS AND COUPONS RAND SELECTION CORPORATION LIMITED (Incorporated in the Union of South Africa) NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS. DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS. As you are aware, the financial year of the Corporation ends on the 30th September, and during recent years dividends have been de- clared towards the latter part of September in each year. The Committee of the London Stock Exchange has recently issued a circular to all Companies having permission to deal in their shares on that Exchange, requesting that profits for the year should be announced at the same time as the final dividend is made known. Your Board feels that the wishes of the London Stock Exchange should, if possible, be com- plied with; but it will be appreciated that it is not possible to declare a final dividend before the close of the financial year, and at the same time advise shareholders of the profits, as these cannot then be determined. It has therefore been decided in future to postpone the declara- tion of the dividend until the final Accounts are made up after the close of the financial year, so that the profits can be announced at the same time. The question of the declaration of the dividend in respect of the year ending 30th September, 1939, will be decided by the Board early in December next, when the profits for the year are known.
