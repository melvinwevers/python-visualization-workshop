   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber and Michael LittleJohns at the UN and Bronwen Maddox in London IRAQ last night backed away from confrontation with the United Nations Security Coun- cil by agreeing that the UN could use its own helicopters to inspect weapons installa- tions. Sir David Hannay, the Brit- ish delegate, said the council regarded the Iraqi decision, delivered in a letter, as an \"unconditional acceptance\" of UN conditions. Such a letter had earlier been demanded by the council. However, tension remained high in Baghdad where Iraqi soldiers continued to prevent a UN inspection team from leav- ing a site with data about the country's nuclear programme. It was the second time in two days a UN group had been detained and Iraq raised the stakes by accusing the team's leader of spying for the US Central Intelligence Agency. Last night, the Security Council demanded that the team be released and allowed to retain the material, which an official said suggested an Iraqi nuclear \"master plan\". Mr Jean-Bernard Merimde, the council president, described the treatment of the team as \"totally unacceptable behav- iour\" and the council expressed its \"strong condem- nation of the way the Iraqi authorities have repeatedly prevented the inspectors from carrying out their duty\". Earlier, President George Bush warned President Sad- dam Hussein \"not to miscalcu- late\" by defying the UN resolu- tions requiring destruction of Iraq's nuclear and unconven- tional weapons programmes. Baker pursues Middle East peace plan US secretary of state James Baker is planning another round of diplomacy aimed at securing final agreement from Israel and the Arabs on attending a Middle East peace conference. Page 4 The US is sending two bat- talions of Patriot air defence missiles to Saudi Arabia from West Germany and, according to CBS television, has put 60 aircraft on alert to move from the US to the Gulf. The prepa- rations are seen as indicating President Bush's intention to maintain pressure on Baghdad, rather than any decision on military action. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, accused Mr David Kay, head of the UN inspection team - which was under guard by 60 Iraqi sol- diers - of spying for the US and of lying. \"Our information is that this man is a CIA officer,\" Mr Aziz said. \"We told him simply that 'you have no right to take these documents and no right to photograph them'.\" The US and the International Atomic Energy Agency rejected the Iraqi accusations. The IAEA team attempted to photocopy personnel files at the Iraqi Atomic Energy head- quarters in Baghdad. Mr David Kydd of the IAEA said mem- bers of the detained team had \"bedded down in their bus inside the gomournd. They're not letting the documents go\". Iraqi claims that documents snatched from the inspectors on Monday had been returned were incorrect, he said. While some had been returned, \"the the most sensitive documents and microfilms were missing\". At the UN Mr Rolf Ekeus, chief of the inspection opera- tion, said he was in contact by satellite with the detained team, which had been ordered not to give up the tapes and films of the Iraqi documents. Mr Bush said he was not drawing a deadline for future military action against Iraq, amid signs that US allies would like more time to urge Iraq to comply with all UN conditions. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said UN inspectors inside Iraq were \"getting into the guts\" of Mr Saddam's military machine as they steadily uncovered evi- dence of his programme to build a nuclear bomb. However, Mr Abdul Amir al- Anbari, the Iraqi delegate at the UN, insisted that the mate- rial comprised only personnel files of scientists and others. Last night's climbdown by Baghdad on the helicopters fol- lowed a protracted stand-off over Iraq's refusal to allow UN helicopters carry out aerial inspections and photography of suspected weapons sites. Iraq had only agreed on inspections if UN monitors used Iraqi heli- copters. Mr Hurd, saying Britain and France were \"entirely solid\" with the US on future action against Iraq, played down the military option, without ruling anything out.",

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff THE GAP between men's and women's earnings is substan- tially wider in the UK than it is in other European Community countries, the Equal Opportu- nities Commission said yester- day as it challenged the politi- cal parties to commit themselves in the run-up to the general election to a pro- gramme of reform on issues affecting women. The EOC figures show that female full-time workers earn, on average, 77 per cent of the hourly earnings of comparable male workers. The gap in the UK is 8-10 percentage points wider than in other EC countries, includ- ing France, Germany and the Netherlands, where direct com- parisons can be made, said the EOC. Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the commission, expects sex equality issues to have a higher profile in the forthcom- ing election campaign than :ver before. Much of the pres- sure for change evident during the past year had come from employers, she said. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to make a substantial statement on :qual opportunities at the end :o next month when he launches a project aimed at increasing the quality of women's participation in the workforce. The initiative, called Oppor- Maternity leave terms sen as block to women...........Page 11 tunity 2000, is being co-ordi- nated by Business in the Com- munity, the voluntary organi- sation for business initiatives, of which the Prince of Wales is president. Companies includ- ing Kingfisher, Sainsbury's, ICI and Legal and General are expected at the launch to announce their targets for the employment and promotion of women. The Labour party last week pledged that, among other measures, it would introduce \"contract compliance\" under which companies seeking pub- lic sector contracts would have to fulfil certain equal opportu- nities criteria. The EOC plans to circulate a list of demands to all members of parliament, which will include proposals to improve access for women to justice and replace the current \"rusty\" sex discrimination and equal pay legislation with a single equal treatment law. The commission also wants to see maternity rights and employment protection at work extended to cover all women, regardless of how long they have worked for an employer or how many hours they work, rather than restrict- ing it under these headings as at present.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston and David Barchard ABBEY NATIONAL is to buy a life insurance company at a cost of several hundred million pounds. An announcement is expected soon and could come as early as today. This will be the first big acquisition by the company since it came to the stock mar- ket in July 1989 and abandoned its status as a mutual building society. Abbey hopes to emulate Lloyds Bank and TSB Group, both of which own life insurers and have been successful in selling life policies to their branch customers. The search for a suitable purchase has been under way for some months and Abbey is believed to have had talks with London & Manchester, although they came to nothing. Unlike the clearing banks, Abbey has hundreds of million pounds in surplus capital,al- though Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, has always made clear that he would not wish to spend more than Â£500m on a takeover. Abbey directors have said they are impressed by the Scottish life companies. Since abandoning its build- ing society status, Abbey has stuck to its traditional busi- ness of providing financial products to personal custom- ers. This strategy has helped it to push up profits throughout the recession, while all the clearing banks have been badly hit by losses on their loans to businesses.",

They also intend to ask them about exports by PRB of pro- pellants for the Iraqi supergun.

Gechem is 60 per cent owned by Socidtd G6n6rale de Takeover that blew up In Astra's face.................Page 26 Belgique, Belgium's largest company. The employees claim Gechem continued to control PRB even after Astra had bought the company and should therefore provide redundancy payments to the 1,400 PRB employees who lost their jobs during 1990 in one of Belgium's largest corporate redundancies. Continued on Page 24 IAstra Continued from Page 1 Astra nearly collapsed after crucial financial details about PRB were withheld during takeover negotiations with Gechem. The British company expected PRB to make a profit in 1989 of BFrlSOm (2.3m) but in fact incurred a BFr720m loss which brought Astra to its knees. The sale is subject to an inquiry by the British Depart- ment of Trade and Industry. Documents in the hands of the Financial Times show that Mr Jean Duronsoy, Gechem's chief executive, was aware that PRB would undershoot its bud- get six months before it was sold to Astra. Mr Duronsoy resigned as chief executive on Monday. Belgian police have asked for the documents to be handed over for their investi- gation. Socitd Gdndrale de Belgique said last night that Gechem was helping the DTI with its inquiries. It refused to com- ment about allegations that Gechem misled Astra during negotiations for the sale of PRB.",

   "text_content" : "By Lara Marlowe in Beirut Reunited in Damascus: Mrs Sunnie Mann with her husband Jackie, hours after he was freed by kidnappers FREED BRITON Mr Jackie Mann and his wife Sunnie flew out of the Syrian capital Damascus for Britain early today. The liberation of the Second World War fighter pilot, the oldest western hostage in Leba- non, came amid reports that an American captive may also be freed by the end of the week. It was the first indication that the gradual release of hos- tages, which began last month, may continue, in spite of an apparent- setback last week. Mr Mann, 77, held captive by the Revolutionary Justice Organisation (RJO) for 32 months, was driven to Damas- cus from Beirut where he had been handed over to Syrian military by his kidnappers. Looking haggard, Mr Mann said on Syrian television: \"It's magnificent to be free. I've never been so welcomed in all my life.\" He told a news conference: \"For more than 2 % years, I have been told 'Don't do this, don't do that, don't speak, be quiet,' [so] that I lost my voice.\" He was taken to the home of the British ambassador for a medical examination where doctors found him fit to travel. A Foreign Office official said Mr Mann would undergo fur- ther medical checks during the flight, to RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. The report that an American hostage would be released this week was carried by the Teh- ran Times in Iran yesterday. The prediction was repeated by Mr Hussein Musawi, a Leban- ese Shia Moslem leader. The likelihood that Mr Mann would be released rose sharply on Monday night when his kid- nappers said his release would pave the way for the next stage of the hostage release process. They praised the negotiating efforts of Mr Javier Pdrez de Cudllar, UN secretary-general, who has sought the release of all remaining hostages in the Middle East. The kidnappers' move contradicted the stance they took last week when they said no more hostages would be freed until Israel had released 20 more Arabs. Mr and Mrs Mann moved to Beirut after the Second World War. He worked as a commer- cial pilot with Lebanon's Mid- dle East Airlines for 20 years, Continued on Page 24 Move in hostage game, Page 4 Mann release while his wife became the air- line's first stewardess. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he was \"delighted\" by the release. President George Bush said he hoped it would lead to freedom for the remaining western cap- tives in Lebanon, including five Americans. Nine westerners and a num- ber of others are still missing in Lebanon, most of them believed to be held by pro-Iranian militants.

   "text_content" : "By Arlane Genillard in Prague PRESIDENT Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia yesterday urged federal deputies to call a referendum to decide on the country's future structure in an attempt to settle growing antagonism between Czechs and Slovaks. \"Since the revolution no sit- uation has been as serious as this one,\" Mr Havel told depu- ties on the first day of the par- liament's autumn session. Slovak, Czech and federal authorities have been trying for the past year to agree on future relations between the Slovak and Czech republics. The federal parliament decided in July to allow the matter to be put to a vote in both republics. On Monday, the Slovak National Party, which holds 14 per cent of the Slovak parlia- ment, asked local deputies to declare the sovereignty of Slo- vakia. It met, however, the resistance of the ruling Chris- tian Democratic Party. A recent poll, conducted by the president's office, shows that 82 per cent and 69 per cent of Czechs and Slovaks respec- tively are in favour of main- taining the current federation. French trade deficit eases France's foreign trade deficit eased slightly in August to FFr3.795bn (Â£370m) compared with FFr3.959bn in July, but the trend remained in line with earlier forecasts, the Finance Ministry said, Ian Davidson reports from Paris. For the first eight months the cumula- tive deficit has risen to FFr32bn, compared to FFr26bn in the same period last year. * Mr Jean-Francois Deniau, head of a French parliamen- tary inquiry into funding of political parties, resigned yes- terday, saying he was being prevented from questioning key witnesses.

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels BACKERS and critics of the Dutch presidency's final draft treaty on political union agree the odds on the 12 governments reaching agreement in time for the Maastricht summit on December 9-10 have lengthened. The Dutch draft proposes to give the European Parliament more legis- lative power and bring much sensitive external and internal security policy making within the Community remit. The critics, chiefly Britain, contend that there is serious doubt that it can produce an accord at Maastricht in its present form. The draft \"is not a fait accompli\", Mr John Major, the British prime minister said yesterday. Supporters of the new text - pre- eminently Germany - dismiss British doubts as faint-hearted and draw attention to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's oft-stated position that he will agree to only monetary union if it is accom- panied by political union. But even they admit that the Twelve's negotiators will now have i their work cut out to meet the Maa- stricht deadline, so crucial are the changes proposed by the Dutch, with half of the six-month presidency now gone. Even federalist Italy advised the Dutch not to overturn what had been discussed all summer. The main points in the Dutch draft are: * Structure. It is here that the Dutch have most backtracked from the treaty draft they inherited from the Luxembourg presidency, which went some considerable way to placating the UK, France, Denmark and Ireland by keeping foreign and internal secu- rity policies outside the standard Community machinery that involves the Brussels Commission and the Strasbourg parliament. Instead, the Dutch have lumped these touchy areas of policy-making into the main treaty, while making clear that national governments retain certain special rights. 0 Foreign policy. To the outsider, much of the argument raging over the future structure of the EC constitu- tion is pure semantics. Yet, the Brit- ish point to the Dutch foreign policy provisions, which do not rule out tak- ing decisions by majority vote. The volatile world of international relations does not admit neat catego- risation of \"policy\" and \"implement- ing\" decisions, they stress. Besides, they fear being pushed down a future slippery slope by the Dutch plan for a 1996 constitutional review of the pro- visions governing foreign/security/de- fence policies, as well as voting rights for MEPs. * Defence. The Dutch, not much less Atlanticist than the UK, have pro- posed that the EC's \"common security policy will be complementary... to that of Nato and the Western Euro- pean Union, which will continue to contribute substantially to security and stability\". But Britain, neutral Ireland and Nato-minded Portugal will dislike the Dutch call for a com- mon defence policy in 1996. The planned Nato summit in November will powerfully determine the out- come of the Twelve's defence debate. * Internal policy. The Dutch have attempted a compromise by giving the Commission a role in immigration and asylum, but keeping police/judi- cial co-operation as something the i member states should decide among themselves. But the possibility that the Euro- pean Court of Justice might be brought in to settle disputes in this area is rightly feared by the UK, which will probably soon face a legal challenge from its partners and Brus- sels for failing to comply with the i \"free movement of people\" provisions of the 1992 programme. i* Industrial policy. This is one r bright spot for the UK. As might be expected from another free-market country, the Netherlands has pruned the dirigisme out of the French-in- spired industrial policy provisions in the Luxembourg text. What is left is a call for broad horizontal policies, which should not conflict with EC competition rules. * The European Parliament. The 518 directly-elected MEPs would get, under the Dutch plan, the right (a) to reject, by an absolute majority (260 votes), legislation emerging from a second reading by the Council of Min- isters, and (b) the power to ensure that measures on third world aid, high-tech R & D and environmental programmes could not pass without their positive approval. This is known as \"co-decision\". Since the European Parliament has only once used its more limited power to kill a bill (on protecting workers from benzene exposure), it has always been keener on co-decision.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels THE European Commission plans to break up electricity and gas production monopo- lies as part of a wide-ranging effort to open up a genuine internal energy market in the Community. The controversial proposals, which have not yet been approved by the full Commis- sion, go further than initial plans simply to allow consum- ers to buy electricity and gas from suppliers in other EC countries - the system known as third party access, which has much support in Britain. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commis- sioner, told a conference in Berlin yesterday that the energy and competition direc- torates were preparing a series of measures which would also: * challenge existing monopo- lies in the construction of transmission lines, and in the export, import and production of energy; * unbundle the administra- tion of production, transmis- sion and distribution activi- ties, to allow transparent competition and prevent cross- subsidisation of the different areas. Commissioners' top advisers will discuss the long-awaited proposals for the first time at the end of this week. Mr Cardoso e Cunha and Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, want to use a two-pronged approach to open the gas and electricity mar- kets, and each industry will be the subject of two directives. O Broadly, legislation under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome - which allows the Commission to push through legislation without the formal approval of member states - will be used to break down existing restrictions. O Article 100A direc- tives - which need be approved only by a qualified majority of member states - will be used to establish the ground rules for a new, liber- alised energy market * The Soviet Union, backed by central and east European countries, yesterday indicated that the proposed European energy charter would have to allow less developed econo- mies time to put its demands into practice, Andrew Hill writes. Delegates from the 35 mem- bers of the energy charter con- ference were meeting in Brus- sels to discuss the text of the charter, which is partly aimed at helping the Soviet Union exploit its natural resources.",

Mr Carl Bildt, the leader of the Moderates, was given a mandate yesterday by the speaker of the parliament to form a cabinet. The new government would include the Moderates, Liber- als, Centre Party and Christian Democrats, which would have combined total of 170 seats in the 349-member Riksdag. The non-socialist parties have been negotiating over a government since the general election on September 15, which handed the ruling Social Democrats their worst elec- toral defeat since 1928. There had been doubts whether the rural-based Centre Party would join the govern- ment since it had expressed reservations about EC mem- bership and plans to trim pub- lic spending. But Mr Bildt said yesterday there was broad agreement among the non-socialist parties over the EC, the public sector and economic policy.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "THE Swiss government gave broad approval to a planned reform of its stamp tax on securities transactions that would include abolishing the levy on Swiss investment funds, Reuter reports from Bemrne. The reform aims to counter worries by banks that the tax is making Switzerland uncom- petitive as a financial centre and driving business abroad. A first tilt at a stamp tax revision failed to get past a ref- erendum in June when it was coupled with the introduction of an unpopular value-added tax. A fast-track parliamentary bill has now revived and aug- mented the June proposals. These include abolishing 0.3 per cent transaction duties on professional traders' holdings, Euromarket issues and trans- actions made by Swiss institu- tions abroad, and cutting duties on cash bonds. A statement from the Finance Ministry said the gov- ernment approved of a parlia- mentary committee's plan to scrap the tax on investment funds as well. But it rejected a committee proposal to abolish stamp duty levied when com- panies amend their structure or change their legal domicile. The government also rejected the committee's view that a new levy of 2.5 per cent on life insurance premiums, planned as a way of clawing back some lost revenue, should be dropped. Instead, the minis- ters went further, proposing the introduction of stamp duty on certain property insurances as well. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

   "text_content" : "Tim Coone finds Charles Haughey struggling to restore confidence HE Irish love a scandal. When the wealthy and powerful are toppled in a country where almost 20 per cent of the workforce is unem- ployed, there is a sense of moral retribution on the part of the little man. But even the little men and women have been surprised by the veritable feast of controver- sies that appears to be turning into a fight for the political survival of Mr Charles Haughey, the prime minister. Within two weeks, some of the best and brightest of Ireland's corporate life, most publicly identified with the Fianna Fail government, have become the focus of a series of public inquiries into question- able business practices involv- ing property and share deals in public sector companies. Mr Haughey said the contro- versies had broken \"like a tidal wave\" over his government. They undoubtedly prompted his announcement at the week- end, that the time had come for the creation of a erious hand office along Britih nes. Yesterday Mr Michael Smar- ft, Irelands lemi idustri- aBst and chairman of Telecom ireamn the staerun telecom- munications company, resigned after becoming embroled in a R1ia (9.1m) proprtr ove a site for the He has admitted he an inteest in a euuunyUnited Propety auIw. uNO -U. that owned the site six months beme it wa M to ITeloBm.

Earlier this month, the recety-privatised Greencore sgar a foods group, became the focus of five separate inqul- ries into share dealings by senior executives and which has already cost the job of Mr Chris Comerford. the compa- ny's chide executive. Both Mr Comerford and Mr Smurftt have been credited with turnng these prevously km-akinc state enterprises into profitle cocerns. MrBafaey abo suggeted that r Seams Palroer, chair man of the Custom House DoIc Authlrity, mad who is also caiman of shold o add m ea nca the s t r Paireir Ound his r hn-g ft ri is seen as a great loss for Ireland's new International Financial Services Centre, for which Mr Paireeir was respon- sible as chairman of the docks authority. Also in the spotlight is National City Brokers, a local stockbroking firm that has become one of the leading firms in Dnblin in the past 10 years, and which had recently begun a study into the Tele- com privatisation. NCB advised Greencore during its rntisation. Mr HaIhey has asked NCB to withraw om the Telecom study which it has agreed to do \"until the air is cleare d the inquiry co dete*. The chair- man of NcB is Mr Desmond Drmot, a personal ieud of Mr laughey who first mooted the ide of the Inter- natonal na Services Addiug to Mr baughey's problems an iaa gly severe strains within the econ- omy and especially govern- ment finances. Mr Haughey admitted at the weekend that \"1992 is going to be very diffi- cult\" and that the cash was not to hand to meet the next round of promised public sector pay increases due early next year. Failure to meet those could cause the collapse of the Pro- gramme for Economic and Social Progress and the indus- trial peace pact with the trade unions. By launching the public inquiries into Greencore and Telecom, and announcing the formation of a Serious Fraud Office, Mr Haughey clearly hopes to deflect criticism from the government itself and to restore confidence in his admlpiitratoin. But as Mr Proinsias de Rossa, leader of the Worters' party said: \"There is the saying about smoke and fire, well there's so much smoke about right now, we can't even see where we are going.\" Mr Michael Smurfitt resigned yesterday evening as head of Telecom Eireann, Ireland's state-ran telecom- munications company.

Regrettably I do not see 'stepping aside' as a realistic option either for me or for the company in the present circumstances\". Mr Smurfitt added: \"Dur- ing the 12 years I have been ssociated with Telecom Eireann I have acted prop- erly at all times in my deal- igs on its behalf and deeply relent any suggestions to the -cotrary.

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber, US Editor, in New York FRANCE called yesterday for a new international code of con- duct to give beleaguered minorities the right to request humanitarian assistance from outside powers during a crisis. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Ronald Dumas, the French for- eign minister, said the code would build on the model ear- lier this year when UN forces intervened on behalf of the Kurdish refugees in Iraq. The French proposal could prove controversial among some members of the UN, such as China and India, which are nervous about the trend toward international interven- tion at the expense of national sovereignty. China is particularly sensi- tive about its relationship with Tibet, while India has a fester- ing problem with secessionists in Kashmir. However, the UN is rapidly expanding its role as peace-maker and peace-keeper, as illustrated by latest plans for ending the civil war and holding elections in Cambodia. France has been a leading advocate of a UN role in the Yugoslav crisis - despite ini- tial scepticism from allies such as Britain. Today, Mr Dumas will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council which is expected to impose an arms embargo against Yugoslavia, with the possibility of further action such as an oil embargo. In his speech, Mr Dumas warned against dangers of \"blind nationalism\", while praising the benefits of the European Community which imposed some limits on national sovereignty in the interests of peace and prosper- ity. German violence spurs debate Fighting over the rights of for- eigners in Germany will move from the streets of the former DDR to the Bundestag in Bonn today, Christopher Parkes writes from Bonn. An emer- gency debate has been called following several days of vio- lence, the evacuation of 230 Romanians and Vietnamese from a besieged apartment block in east Germany, and the publication of official figures showing a sharp increase in attacks on immigrants. The likely tone was set yes- terday by Mr Wolfgang Bbtsch, a prominent member of the ruling coalition, who denounced as \"shameless\" a charge from Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, opposition SPD chair- man, that the government's stance was \"over-emotional\". Tempers were fired by news police had secretly evacuated 230 foreigners from Hoyer- swerda in northern Saxony, taking them out of range of mobs of skinheads and extreme right-wingers who had been attacking them and their homes for several days. With more than 200,000 asy- lum seekers expected in Ger- many this year, many mem- bers of the ruling CDU want to change the country's liberal constitution to deter economic refugees from asking for asy- lum.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb and Laura Silber in Belgrade THE fragile ceasefire agreed on Sunday between Croatia and Yugoslavia's federal army was breached yesterday when army jets strafed the eastern Cro- atian town of Vinkovci. The Croatian government demanded that the Yugoslav army pull out of its territory, saying this was a precondition for peace, while Mr Stipe Mesic, the Yugoslav president, called on UN secretary-general Javier Pdrez de Cudllar not to allow formalities to hold up the despatch of peace-keeping forces to Yugoslavia. Mr Branko Salaj, Croatia's minister of information, said jets attacked the town in an attempt to lift the blockade on its barracks, which was still being besieged by Croatia's national guard. The accord stipulated the lifting of all Croatian block- ades of federal army barracks based in the republic, as well as the resumption of food, water and electricity supplies. Zagreb radio said several people were killed and 50 injured after the army pounded the town of 40,000 inhabitants with mortar shells. \"The town has been virtually destroyed,\" said a witness. The radio also reported that one person was killed and four injured after fighting at Daru- var, near the Adriatic coast. It added that Lovinac, a village near the coast, was yesterday pounded by mortar shells from an army barracks. Western diplomats said the army attack on Vinkovci might be an attempt by the army and the republic of Serbia to post- pone the reconvening of the European Community-spon- sored peace conference which is due to open in The Hague tomorrow. Meanwhile, leaders of neigh- bouring Bosnia-Hercegovina said yesterday they feared an outbreak of civil war in the ethnically-mixed republic. Gunfights and barricades of army garrisons in Visegrad, eastern Bosnia, threaten to spread through the republic. Serbian leaders in Visegrad announced the formation of a police force to protect Serbs who were \"suffering brutal attacks from local Moslem groups\". Slavic Moslems kept up their blockade of the federal military garrisons in Visegrad. The deployment in Bosnia of army reservists from Montene- gro, a close ally of Serbia, last week has unleashed ethnic conflicts among the republic's population of Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats. At least 2,000 Moslems and Croats have fled the areas where the reservists are sta- tioned. Ethnic tensions were already near breaking point after the proclamation of three Serbian autonomous regions, which amount to about half of Bosnia's territory. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Serbian Democratic party, said: \"Our goal is not to create chaos in Bosnia, but Serbs are suffering in places where we are the minority. They are sacking Serb manag- ers, even at petrol stations.\" Mr Muhamet Cengic, deputy prime minister of Bosnia, was yesterday expected to hold cri- sis talks with General Veljko Kadijevic, the defence minis- ter, to demand a withdrawal of the army troops. He warned: \"Either reservists leave or there will be a catastrophe.\"",

But the agreement, reached on Monday night, faces a severe test as violence simmers across the Transcaucasus and elsewhere in the southern Soviet republics. Details emerged yesterday of clashes in which six Armen- ians were said to have been killed by Azerbaijani militia units, as Mr Yeltsin brokered the peace talks in the Russian spa town of Zheleznovodsk. In a joint communiqud issued after 13 hours of talks in Zheleznovodsk, Mr Levon Ter- Petrosian, president of Armenia, and Mr Ayaz Mutila- bov, his Azerbaijani counter- part, agreed to begin immedi- ate talks towards settling their bitter dispute over the mainly Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan. The dispute has cost more than 800 lives in the past two years. They agreed to implement a ceasefire, remove all armed militia from the region by Jan- uary, resettle the thousands of refugees displaced by the con- flict, and try to restore normal transport and communication links between the two repub- lics. \"This document is signed, it's a historic act and a historic document,\" said Mr Yeltsin. \"It's a document based on com- promise but it gives some pos- sibility for progress to put an end to the bloodshed.\" Although it falls far short of a peace treaty between the two republics, the agreement is a sweet diplomatic success for Mr Yeltsin in an area where the Kremlin had, in four years of trying, made no progress.

While the main role of the forces remained defence, over- seas action required only the agreement of a majority in the Bundestag, Prof Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, commission chair- man, said in Bonn yesterday. The findings seem to resolve a long and laboured argument in Germany over the role of the country's largely con- scripted troops in interna- tional military ventures, which earlier this year limited' its activities in the Gulf war. The issue arose most recently when Germany pressed for an international force to be sent into Yugo- slavia, while apparently being unable to take part itself. The commission, set up a year ago to assess the future of the armed forces, also said the military should be prepared and trained for peace-keeping in Europe or in the framework of the United Nations.

And Diamond Service means complimentary meals and drinks, the luxury of a leather seat, news- papers on breakfast and dinner flights, hot towels, and unaffected, friendly cabin service. Yet your fully-flexible 3 day Executive Return ticket will cost you just Â£192. Compare that with other airlines' business class fares and you save Â£70 every trip. There are even greater savings if you fly to Paris or Dublin. With no compromise on service. That has to be worth thinking about. Even if it isn't your money.

   "text_content" : "The Soviet Union's disintegration is creating a legal morass, reports David White E UROPE'S most ambi- tious arms control treaty risks becoming unworkable because of the Soviet Union's disintegration. The 22 countries which signed the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty last November are pressing on towards ratification in the hope of bringing it into effect next year. But nobody quite knows where CFE is heading. The treaty to reduce hold- ings of heavy army equipment and aircraft took 20 months of intensive negotiation. After signing, it ran 'into trouble over the way Moscow inter- preted its obligations. Now, amid uncertainty over the extent to which the Soviet Union will maintain central- ised military forces, it risks running into a legal morass. It is not the first time the treaty has appeared to be over- taken by events. While it was being negotiated in Vienna between the members of the two military alliances, the Warsaw Pact started cracking up, Germany was united, and most countries laid plans for defence cuts greater than those imposed by the CFE limits. Arms reductions would be expected to go ahead even if the treaty were never enforced. But there would then be no compulsory destruction of equipment, fewer opportunities for countries to inspect each other's forces, and no barrier to re-armament. Governments seem united in seeking ratification as soon as possible. A consensus is build ing up about ways of coping with the most immediate com- plication - the independence of the three Baltic republics. Suggestions that treaty changes might be required are firmly resisted in Vienna. \"There's no enthusiasm any- where to renegotiate this treaty,\" commented one west- ern official. But how far will the Soviet authorities be competent to enforce it? Arms subject to reduction are located in 11 of the old Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Atlantic-to-the Urals treaty area includes the now sovereign Baltic states, Ukraine, Belorussia, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, a bit of Kazakhstan and part of the Russian Federation. 'he map is made more con- plex by different treaty zones. Part of the area comes within an \"extended central zone\" where there are narrower lim- its on equipment totals. Ukraine falls partly in this zone and partly in a \"flank\" zone with its own limits. A legal contradiction sur- rounds the Baltics. Since they are recognised independent states and are not signatories, the treaty clearly does not apply to them. On the other hand, the treaty was agreed on the basis that Moscow's authority extended to their ter- ritory. Eastern European and west- ern officials say that the equip- ment of Soviet troops in Lith- uania, Latvia and Estonia must be counted against the Soviet Union's treaty ceilings, and that these forces should in principle be subject to verifica- tion. The three republics are seeking their withdrawal but Soviet officials have warned it will take time. An understanding could be drawn up, outside the treaty, to cover them, and a separate agreement reached with the Baltics to allow inspection. The possibility has been raised of the Baltics eventually joining the treaty, but the present treaty text contains no provi- sions for accession. Attempts are being made to draw a clear distinction between the Baltics and other republics breaking away from central Soviet control, in order to forestall an arms build-up. A senior east European nego- tiator said there was \"no doubt whatsoever\" that \"successor\" states such as Ukraine would inherit the obligations the Soviet Union had signed up to. \"It is in the interests of the whole of Europe to have these forces under control,\" he said. If some form of union remained, it would be up to Russia and the other republics to divide up the Soviet entitle- ments among themselves, he added. Otherwise, an agreement would need to be worked out with the former Warsaw Pact allies, revising the share-out deal they concluded in Budapest just before the treaty was signed 10 months ago. But a western delegate admitted: \"Frankly, no-one knows which way things will go.\" The emergence of Ukraine as a separate military power \"could put a substantial ques- tion mark over the viability of the treaty\". A crucial part of the CFE agreement is an elaborate veri- fication regime. This involves monitoring thousands of mili- tary bases and breaks new ground by providing for sur- prise \"challenge\" inspections of undeclared facilities. But western officials now raise doubts about how these care- fully-worded provisions will be enforced. \"Will the Soviets be able to take inspection teams into Azerbaijan or Georgia?\" asks one. The Soviet upheaval also overshadows the talks now going on in Vienna - known as CFE-la - about reductions in military manpower. The talks are due to be wound up by March. The original CFE talks were based on two alliances, allow- ing each an equal number of tanks, artillery pieces and so forth. Now that the Soviet Union has lost its alliance, there can be no such starting- point. Western officials are looking above all for exchange of information and facilities for verification. About half the countries have provided data; the Soviets have yet to do so. \"But,\" said one official, \"we're travelling hopefully.\" SOVIT OQUIPMENT CUTS UNDER THE CPF TREATY* .r Feb 1991 1995 Reduction declared CFE required holdings ceiling Tanks 20,725 13,150 7,575 Armoured combat vehicles 29,890 20,000 9,890 Artillery pieces 13,938 13,175 763 Combat aircraft 6,611 5,150 1,461 Attack helicopters 1,480 1,500 * Are wt of Url Mountains and Casplan Sea",

   "text_content" : "By Lran Marlowe in Beirut and Victor Mallet in London THE release yesterday of Mr Jackie Mann, the 77-year-old Briton kidnapped in 1989 on the streets of Beirut, is the lat- est move in a complicated exchange of Middle East hos- tages; it is not likely to be the last. Mr Javier Pdrez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, is the chief intermediary in a series of secret negotiations involving Lebanese Shia Mos- lems, Palestinians, Israel, Iran and Syria (which exerts its influence over most of Leba non). Efforts to resolve the hostage issue once and for all began in earnest last month when Islamic Jihad, a Lebanese kid- nap group linked to the Irani- an-backed Hizbollah, freed Mi John McCarthy, the British journalist, and gave him a let ter for Mr Perez de Cudllar which called for the release of Arab prisoners in Israel and Europe. Since then Mr Pdrez de Cudl- lar and his interlocutors have made unsteady but real prog- ress. Mr Edward Tracy, the US hostage, has been freed in Bei- rut, while Israel has released 51 Lebanese and received infor- mation about three of its seven servicemen missing in Leba- non. It is said in Beirut that there is now a \"calendar\" for releases that could result in the freedom of all western hos- tages within months. Mr Abdel-Halim Khaddam, the Syrian vice-president, said recently that the hostage affair would be resolved \"this year\". Mr All Mohammad Beshar- ati, Iran's deputy foreign min- ister, said in an interview pub- lished yesterday that he hoped \"by January, all hostages irre- spective of their nationalities will be able to go home\". Statements by Lebanese kid- nappers at the time of Mr McCarthy's release suggest that the UN's involvement in A tired Jackie Mann in Damascus yesterday the hostage negotiations began early in the summer under the auspices of Mr Giandomenico Picco, a UN envoy. In a communique issued this month with a photograph of Mr Mann, the Revolutionary Justice Organisation said it would release a videotape of meetings between UN officials and kidnappers to hold the negotiators to their commit- ments. It is possible, however, that some negotiations have taken place without the direct involvement of the UN. The International Committee of the Red Cross has acted as an intermediary between the Israelis and parties holding the bodies of Israeli servicemen, in particular Hizbollah and the Democratic Front for the Liber- ation of Palestine, which recently repatriated the body of Samir Assad, a Druze Israeli soldier. Further releases are on the cards, although the multiplic- ity of interested parties seems to have made it impossible to stick to a precise timetable. Mr Mann's release was delayed once because his kidnappers complained that Israel should have freed 20 more Lebanese prisoners first. Even Mr Nabih Berri, the leader of the Shia Moslem Amal militia, has attempted to involve himself in negotiations by claiming to hold two Israeli bodies which he wants to trade for the remaining 280 or so Lebanese prisoners held at the al-Khiam prison in Israeli-controlled south Leba- non. Western governments and Lebanese Shia Moslems are convinced that the release of hostages has been hastened by Iranian and Syrian attempts to make friends in a world now dominated by the US. More reliable information about the remaining western hostages has emerged in the past four or five months than in the five previous years. \"The Syrians, the Iranians and the Israelis all want to help Bush now,\" said one Leb- anese close to Hizbollah recently. As their assets dwindle, the kidnappers and their support- ers continue to squeeze as much political capital out of the hostages as they can. Iran and Syria insist that they have no real influence over the Lebanese kidnappers or knowledge about the hos- tages, although they are remarkably well informed about imminent releases and eager to take the credit when someone is freed. The fragile process of releas- ing hostages could break down again, particularly if radical Palestinian or Lebanese groups pushed on to the fringes of Middle East politics seek to assert themselves. The Leban- ese hostage-takers are also seeking guarantees for their own safety after all the west- erners are released. But so far, the omens are good for the Lebanese held by Israel - including Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, the Hizbol- lah leader - and for the nine westerners in Lebanon.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in New York and Our Middle East Staff MR James Baker, US secretary of state, is planning another round of shuttle diplomacy aimed at securing final agree- ment from Israel and the Arabs on attending a Middle East peace conference. A senior British official said yesterday that Mr Baker had informed foreign ministers of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council that he was making progress with the various parties. However, he still needs to close the final deal, the official said. If the US fails to secure agreement from Israel and Pal- estinian representatives as well as Syria, one option will be to issue invitations to all parties to attend a confer- ence, tentatively planned for next month, the official said. ITr anHn vur MIuIuu cEaI QrW Mr Baker has made more than half a dozen trips to the Middle East since the end of the Gulf war in an effort to win agreement on the terms for attending a regional peace con- ference. Meanwhile Palestinian hard- liners campaigned yesterday against the US-sponsored peace conference which is supported in principle by many Palestin- ian moderates. Mr George Habash, leader of the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told the Palestine National Council (PNC), the parliament- in-exile which is meeting this week in Algiers, that the American plans were \"a pro- gramme to bury the Palestin- ian question\". Mr Baker has asked Palestin- ians to compromise on their choice of delegates to the peace conference to satisfy Israeli demands that the Palestine Liberation Organisation and residents of east Jerusalem be excluded. Mr Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liber- ation of Palestine, another left-wing PLO faction, called for armed struggle against Israel. -Michael Littlejohns adds rom the United Nations: In a surprise gesture Mr Boris Pan- kin, the Soviet foreign minis- ter, in an address to the UN offered strong support for Pres- ident George Bush's proposal that the UN repeal its 1970 res- olution equating Zionism with racism.

   "text_content" : "Julian Ozanne on the frustrations' of the urban poor with an anachronistic regime AIRE'S descent into rioting and looting by mutinous government soldiers and argry urban youths over the last two days follows the refusal of President Mobutu Sese Seko's oppressive and bankrupt 26-year-old regime to bow down to popular demands for political change. The eruption of violence and anarchy in the capital Kinshasa and the southern mining town of Kowlezi has left at least 10 people dead so far and plunged the country into its deepest crisis since the bloody years of post-colonial independence from Belgium in 1960. It has also ignited the discontent of Zaire's increasingly impoverished O urban population - struggling to survive severe food shortages and 3,000 per cent inflation - with a regime unwilling to accept a peaceful transition from dictatorship, nepotism and corruption to . democracy and economic I liberalisation. The decision yesterday by France and Belgium to send troops into the country to prepare for the evacuation of their nationals also highlights the degree to which Mr Mobutu has been deserted by his traditional western allies. These now see him as an F embarrassing anachronism in the post-Cold War World where d African rulers no longer win support simply because of their v commitment to capitalism and E the west. 1 For months, Zaire's s opposition movement - made c up of former politicians, trade r unions and civic associations t, - has been warning that a d violent showdown would be tl unavoidable unless Mr Mobutu c honoured his April 1990 s1 promises to move the country a .A\" A SmIuun I-paruy uemoracj. As in several other African countries - such as Benin, Cameroon and neighbouring Congo - Mr Mobutu eventually caved into pressure from the pro-democracy opposition and convened a national conference empowered to decide the country's political and constitutional future. But as soon as it opened, nearly seven weeks ago, it fell into disarray amid accusations by the opposition that Mr Mobutu had packed the conference with bogus delegates and secret security officers bent on disrupting the I President Mobutu Sese Seko: the opposition believes he will not concede I mower peacefully democratic proceedings. The opposition, led by veteran politicians such as Mr Etienne Tsibikedi and Mr Jean Nguz A Karl-i-Bond mounted a successful boycott of the conference. Mr Mobutu's refusal to meet their demands to reconvene a truly democratic body added fuel to the growing frustration in the capital and exacerbated suspicions that the \"Big Man\" was up to his old tricks and would not concede power 4 peacefully. The continuing economic deterioration, marked by hyper-inflation, crumbling infrastructure, negative economic growth, an unserviceable debt of $9bn (Â£5.3bn) to $10bn (Â£5.9bn), rapid devaluation of the zaire - the currency - and critical shortages of the foreign exchange earnings needed to feed the import-dependent economy, spawned the growth of a deprived urban population. For many, there was nothing to lose from taking to the streets. At least 10 people were killed three weeks ago when security police fired tear gas and bullets on rioting youths who had erected barricades in the slum areas of Kinshasa. The addition to the ranks of rioters this week of mutinous soldiers, apparently discontented with their poor pay, raises serious questions about the loyalty of the army and security forces. Fears are growing that without a rapid political response from Mr Mobutu, Zaire, already bloodied by years of tribal and secessionist conflicts, could easily go the way of other traditionally western-backed dictatorships, such as Somalia and Liberia, which have disintegrated into tribal bloodletting. The prospect of the violent implosion of Zaire - a country with large cobalt and copper reserves - has frightening implications for the stability of the entire region."

   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagstyl in Tokyo THE Japanese Ministry of Finance yesterday punished the country's scandal-tainted Big Four securities companies after they revealed Y43.5bn (Â£190m) in previously undis- closed compensation payments for trading losses incurred by favoured cust6mers. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, said he would ban the brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - from underwrit- ing Japanese government bonds for a month. The penalty is being imposed for the Y43.5bn paid to around 78 clients for trading losses sus- fered in the year to March 1991. The payments are separate from Y128.3bn paid to 230 cli- ents in 1987-90, and revealed two months ago. The big four brokers yester- day published lists of clients who received compensation in 1990-91. As in 1987-90, the payments were largely made to large companies and their subsid- iaries, along with small and medium-sized financial institu- tions. Nikko paid out the largest sum - Y23.5bn to 23 clients - followed by Yamaichi with Y16.4bn to 14 customers, Daiwa with Y3.27bn to 20 and Nomura with just Y435m to six. The payments were made after the finance ministry in December 1989 ordered brokers to stop paying compensation. The payments, made as the Japanese stock market was falling sharply during 1990, mostly arose from the liquida- tion of eigyo tokkin - special investment funds entrusted for discretionary management to brokers. The ministry had asked secu- rities companies to end the eigyo tokkin system because of the conflicts of interest it cre- ated with brokers acting simul- taneously as fund managers. But clients found it difficult to accept the closure of these accounts in the midst of a declining market because liqui- dation would force them to realise heavy losses. So the brokers paid compensation. Nikko said there had been many arguments with clients over tokkin fund closures. About half the compensation revealed yesterday was paid out to small and medium-sized banks and finance companies: these investors were most active in aggressive buying in the final stages of the 1980s bull market. Other recipients included subsidiaries of Marubeni, the trading group, Hitachi, the electronics combine, and Mit- subishi Oil, an energy group. Several public sector employee pension funds were also named. International Capital Markets, Page 34 d el ih Q e: (i P t A v a P 'I",

Last month auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells and Coo- pers & Lybrand signed unqualified accounts for ZCCM and Memaco respectively. Angolan president visits Britain Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos began a two-day visit to Britain yesterday to encourage foreign investment in his country as it moves towards democracy and tries to heal an economy crippled by civil war, Reuter reports. Mr dos Santos was last night meeting Mr John Major, the prime minister, and business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry. Talks falter on boat people Talks between Britain and Vietnam on setting up special holding centres in Vietnam for returning boat people appear to have faltered and both sides are now exploring new ways to speed repatriations, Angus Foster writes from Hong Kong. The main stumbling block is the question of sovereignty. The centres could not be managed by Vietnam without incurring criticism from the US, which opposes forcible repatriation, but Vietnam is not prepared to cede territory to international organ- isations. Talks are continuing in Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, between the two sides and representatives of the United Nations High Com- missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisa- tion for Migration. Roh proposes Korean peace plan South Korean President Rob Tae Woo yesterday proposed a three-point plan for normalising relations with the communist North, beginning with a peace treaty and renunciation of the use of force, replacing their present fragile armistice, writes Michael Littlejohns from New York. Addres-i- g the UN General Assembly, to which the two Kor- ean states were admitted as members last week, he called for military coidencebuild measures.",

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Ottawa A SWEEPING package of constitutional reforms was unveiled yesterday by Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minis- ter. The reforms would dismantle the country's pervasive internal trade barri- ers in exchange for giving Quebec and the other nine provinces wide powers in other spheres. The 28-part blueprint is designed to persuade French-speaking Quebec not to break from the rest of the country, while also addressing the dissatisfac- tion of English-speaking Canadians with their political institutions. The proposals replace the ill-fated Meech Lake accord, whose collapse in June 1990 spurred the Independence move- ment in Quebec. Mr Mulroney told parliament yester- day that the government's proposals aimed \"to build a strong and prosper- ous Canada where all Canadians can feel at home.\" Speaking in French, he stressed however that the 7m Quebecols must be free to \"preserve and promote a vibrant French-speaking society\". The premier said the government would consider changes to its blueprint, based on the findings of a parliamen- tary committee which begins public hearings today. The committee is due to complete its work next February, working against the backdrop of Quebec's threat to hold an independence referendum by Octo- s ber 1992 unless it receives a satisfactory offer from the rest of the country., I Much initial reaction to the proposals i was cautious, but they were immedi- ately criticised as inadequate by Quebec separatists. Mr Jean Chrtten, opposi- tion leader, called on the government to t hold a nationial referendum on the final package of constitutional reforms. The most divisive elements of the ; Mulroney plan are likely to be constitu- tional recognition of Quebec as a \"dis- 3 tinct society\", and a prohibition from t mid-1995 :on any la's or practices I which regtrict the mobility of poe, capital, services and $oods within nhe country. The government's :other proosl i include n elected and more powe Senate, a 1constitutional guamnte of selfjgovermnent for aboriginal peope, *greaterregional rpresreentation on he board of tme Bank of Canada, and an I1 ndependent agency to monitor federpl and provincial economic policies. - The provinces would gain greater powers in, among others, the fields bs manpower training, cuIlture, immigr-. i tion, broadcasting and tourism.",

Mr Louis Sullivan, health and human services secretary, said he wanted to meet insur- ers within the next two months to see how unnecessary paper- work could be eliminated. Some advocates of a national health insurance system have argued that this could save up to $136bn (Â£80.4bn) a year in administrative costs, but Mr Sullivan rejected these esti- mates. Health department offi- cials said savings might reach $15bn to $20bn. Mr Sullivan also rejected the comprehensive reform propos- als that several Democratic leg- islators, including Senate majority leader Mr George Mitchell, have put forward. \"I will not propose another grand, sweeping, speculative scheme,\" he said, urging \"immediate and practical options\". These include easier access to health insurance plans for small businesses, the use of more cost-effective healthcare procedures, and tax changes to make consumers more aware of the true cost of healthcare. Employers complain bitterly over the soaring cost of medi- cal insurance.",

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York MR Mario Cuomo, Democratic governor of New York state, presented yesterday a $7bn (Â£4.1bn) package of public works to revive the ailing econ- omy of New York city, together with important fiscal reforms to help solve the city's budget crisis. In a presentation to business and civic leaders in Manhat- tan, Mr Cuomo outlined what he claimed was \"one of the most exciting economic devel- opment agendas in this state's history,\" which would create 25,000 permanent and 54,000 construction-related jobs and generate $8.2bn in economic activity. The speech marked a dra- matic intervention by the gov- ernor in the city's affairs. Mr Cuomo had stood aloof for months while Democratic Mayor David Dinkins struggled - eventually successfully - to balance the 1992 budget amid a severe regional recession and mounting social problems. With little sign of an economic upturn the city faces severe sis- cal pressures for the foresee- able future. But while Mr Cuomo's plan won widespread praise from city figures for leadership and vision, critics wondered how much of the package would advance beyond rhetoric. They noted that the host of capital spending projects out- lined by the governor would have to be financed largely by the private sector, and ques- tioned how much of this money would be forthcoming. The plan includes connect- ing New York's Kennedy and La Guardia airports with the city's existing subway and commuter rail lines by a new light railway, to be funded by a $3-a-head levy on departing air travellers. It also involves renovation of the city's two key passenger rail terminals, Grand Central and Penn; the building of a huge new waterfront residen- tial and commercial estate in the borough of Queens, directly across the East River from the United Nations; and studies on the feasibility of a high-speed ferry service serv- ing Manhattan and surround- ing commuter areas. To help solve the fiscal prob- lem, Mr Cuomo said the state would gradually take over the rapidly growing burden for Medicaid, providing health assistance to the poor, which is currently shouldered by the city and other local govern- ments. By the end of the cen- tury this was expected to save the city about $lbn a year. Mr Cuomo said he put together the blueprint because the state government had a 4- 41L.- -.&.. IN- ns t ..-- - - n- --n -9 4hu responsibility to the city, which accounted for 7m of New York's 18m pop- ulation and much of its reve- nues. However, his intervention may revive speculation on whether he will seek the Demo- cratic presidential nomination. Mr Cuomo, seen as one of the Democrats' best hopes, has repeatedly denied any such plan. But in yesterday's speech he renewed his attack on the Bush administration and con- gressional Democrats for ignor- ing the plight of America's cities.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Prowse in Washington US consumer confidence fell for the third consecutive month in September, further undermining hopes of a robust economic recovery. But a new index of business confidence indicates many companies remain cautiously optimistic. The Conference Board, a New York-based business anal- ysis group, said its index of consumer confidence fell 3.5 points to 72.7 last'month. This compares with a high of 81.1 in March, following victory in the the Gulf war, and levels of between 100 and 120 before the recession began in July last year. Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the figures indi- cated the economy was unlikely to rebound later this year. \"Concerned and insecure consumers would be cautious spenders,\" he said. The survey shows increasing pessimism over employment prospects: only 7.5 per cent of respondents said jobs were \"plentiful\" while 40 per cent said they were \"hard to get\". Consumers seem increas- ingly anxious about prevailing conditions. An index measur- ing the \"current situation\" fell sharply to 39.3, the lowest level since the recession began. However, an index measuring consumer \"expecta- tions\" fell only slightly to 95, close to levels in the spring. Business confidence, how- ever, appears more resilient. A new index compiled by Cah- ners Economics, a Boston- based economic consultancy, rose to 64.8 in September, against 64.5 in August and an initial reading of 62.2 in June. The index, based on a sur- vey of 400 business managers, tracks changes in hiring, pro- duction, inventories and other measures of business activity. An index in the mid-60s indicates that businesses are positive about the economic outlook, said Mr Kermit Baker, Cahners' chief econo- mist. He said nearly 83 per cent of managers polled fore- cast steadily improving busi- ness conditions. But they remained cautions about new (nwvetmAnt .uwrrÂ·",

Had he been around yesterday for the chaos sur- a rounding the nation's first pri- a vatisation he would have seen v his words vindicated. Moments before the hammer e was due to fall on Usiminas, t the country's largest steel mill, % the auction was suspended by a the National Development d Bank (BNDES), which is head- a ing the rogramme. In a brief press notice the c bank's directors said: \"In view i of the wave of last-minute ! political actions and legal pro- i cesses, making the auction unviable, we have decided to c delay it.\" S The move was in response to ( a ruling by a Rio de Janeiro court yesterday and a Brasilia c court on Monday night outlaw- ( ing the participation in the 1 auction of all foreign debt ( instruments, some domestic 1 debt, and privatisation certifi- I cates that financial institutions were forced to buy last year. ( Without these, officials admit, ( they were unlikely to achieve i the minimum price of Â£lbn. Mr Luis Chrisostomo, an I aide to the bank's president, i said the directors had waited I until the last possible moment i to suspend the auction in the ] hope that the Supreme Court i would decide in favour of their appeal. But it did not reach a verdict in time. Later the appeal was won and Mr Chrisostomo said the auction would take place within the next fortnight. The BNDES announcement ended a day of confusion. As three courts were discussing various petitions to stop or allow the sale, potential bid- ders were in frantic discus- sions with lawyers and part- ners while the 12 foreign banks expected to bid were fielding irate calls from headquarters. Some participants decided to withdraw. As fears grew that Usiminas could be sold sub judice the stock market dropped 5 per cent in 30 minutes. \"Basically we have three questions,\" said the director of one bank. \"Will the auction happen? If so, what currencies can be used to bid with? And if we do bid, what is the risk of the sale then being annulled?\" Although in theory legal obstacles have now been cleared, two congressional bills against the sale remain, along with considerable uncertainty. Ironically the launch of the programme, already delayed by 15 months and far behind the rest of Latin America, was sup- posed to have restored credibil- ity to the Collor government.",

The report details the results of an 18-month investigation by the government agency, conducted at the request of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas democrat and chairman of the Senate finance commit- tee, after US industry com- plaints. The federal investigators questioned officials at 59 lead- ing US semiconductor and computer companies as well as two federal laboratories. Twen- ty-two of the companies reported multiple instances in which they ordered equipment already in use by Japanese manufacturers, only to have their orders rejected or delayed for up to two years. The report does not identify either the Japanese or the US companies involved. The US companies were promised confidentiality because of fears that Japanese suppliers would retaliate, Mr Bentsen said. The investigation uncovered- more than 40 examples of Japa- nese companies withholding semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials as well as an additional 16 inci- dents in which US companies were unable to obtain com- puter parts, components or materials. Seven US companies also said that they had been forced to buy unwanted equipment or components in order to obtain the technology products that they were seeking from Japa- nese suppliers. Such \"tie-in\" sales are illegal under US anti- trust laws. Japanese companies that were among those cited for delaying or refusing sales to US companies were inter- viewed by the GAO investiga- tors. All denied the charges. Senator Bentsen called for the US government to continue its support of Sematech, the four-year old semiconductor industry consortium which aims to re-establish US leader ship in chip technology. Sema tech receives half of its annual $200m (Â£118.3m) budget from the US government.",

Given that China does not have diplomatic relations with South Korea and that North Korea is a communist soul- mate with a friendship, as the propaganda puts it, \"sealed by the blood shed in the Korean war\", the political probability was the lathe was sold to the north. \"No, no, it was a South Kor- ean company that bought our lathe,\" said a representative of the Shenyang factory, making clear that a barter deal with North Korea would be not worth a boast at an exhibition that was more about commer- dcial reality than socialist real- ism. Political change was also on display a few stands away, where Mr Bedrich Musil, regional head of Strojimport, the Czechoslavakian company, explained his 'job has been made far more dificult by the collapse of communism in Europe. In the past, he has exported heavy machinery under barter agreements drawn up annually by the Czech and Chinese govern- ments. But those government-to- government agreements are gone, and Mr Mus must now negotiate hs own barter deals and ind Chinese products that will sell well in Czechoslo- vaka: \"We have arrnged to swap mountain bikes and cot- ton Tshirts for our machine tools.

Mr Strauss-Kahn was accom- panied by businessmen fron 25 ladin French companies.

Mr Strauss-Kahn pointed out that trade between the two rep- resented only 4 per cent of South Africa's total, compared to 18 per cent in the case of Germany. He also noted that France was South Africa's eighth largest trading partner whereas, given its trading sta- tus elsewhere in the world, it should be about fourth. He attributed this discrep- ancy to the diligence with which France had imple- mented sanctions. * The French government has granted Genmin, the mining arm of the South African min- ing house Gencor, and BRGM, the French mining parastatal, the right to explore and exploit the gold prospect at Montagne Tortue in French Guyana."

   "text_content" : "William Dullforce reports on Washington's hard line on shipping THE EUROPEAN Comp- munity, with its intran- sigence over farpi reform, is not alone in bearing the blame for the failure o conclude the Uruguay Round trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement op Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The US is responsible for several stumbling blocks to agreement that would libera- ise international trade in se;- vices. Crucial differences over shipping, telecommunication) and financial services have still to be resolved. Last week the Nordic coun- tries - Finland, Iceland, Nor. way and Sweden - put for- ward a proposal aimed at \"smoking out the Americans\"'' on shipping. The Nordic coun- tries' ideas are now being care- fully scrutinised in Washing- ton and other capitals and it is' too early to say whether they; would be acceptable to the US shippers who have so far deter-! mined the US negotiating position. The US has been alone in demanding that maritime transport be excluded from an agreement on services; other participants, including the' European Community, insist that shipping must be covered. More recently, the US has con- centrated on trying to secure exemption for shipping from the Gatt's non-discriminating most-favoured-nation (MFN) rule which stipulates that a country must extend any trade benefits granted to another country to all Gatt members. The US has also been the only main trading nation to demand that cabotage or coastal ship- ping restrictions be omitted from any liberalising deal on maritime transport. Bulk shipping - the trans- port of oil, grains, coal and ores on ships owned by an exporter or an independent shipping company - makes up by far the larger part of inter- national seaborne transport and is generally accepted as operating under a relatively liberal regime. The talks on shipping services have there- fore focused on the cabotage business and on the cargo-shar- ing arrangements, including the liner trades, which carry goods on regular routes on fixed schedules and are esti- mated to account for 11 per cent of world seaborne trade. Liner trades are usually organised by \"conferences\" of companies which fix freight rates and sailing frequencies and pool revenues. The US insists that conferences be open to new members and opposes the closed conferences run by companies in the EC, the Nordic and other countries. Washington has refused to sign the United Nations liner code, designed to improve developing countries' share of world shipping. Under the code two countries can reserve 40 per cent each of the maritime trade between them for their own flag vessels, leaving 20 per cent for carriers from other nations. The core of the US position has been its refusal to have its domestic shipping laws made subject to an international ser- vices agreement that would impose a multilateral dispute settlement system. Its laws allow it to take uni- laterally retaliatory mea- sures to combat Wvhat it regards as discriminatory prac- tices by foreign countries. Since they condone discrimi- nating, selective retaliation against offending countries, these laws conflict with the MFN rule. American shippers have argued that US regulations offer a more effective means than a multilateral agreement of opening up foreign shipping markets and would liberalise world shipping faster. The EC and most other major shipping nations are sceptical. US laws stipulate that 75 per cent of farm aid shipments, at least 50 per cent of US govern- ment-generated cargoes and all cargoes generated by the US Export-Import Bank be shipped on vessels flying the US flag. These measures account for nearly 40 per cent of all com- mercial freight carried by US flag vessels. In addition, under the Mer- chant Marine Act, the so-called Jones Act, all goods trans- ported by water between US ports must be carried in US flag vessels crewed by US citi- zens. This covers oil and bulk commodities. The Jones Act, together with laws prohibiting exports of Alaskan North Slope oil, effectively reserves all Alaskan oil cargoes for US flag vessels. The Nordic proposal calling for a freeze on trade-distorting measures in shipping and the removal of existing restrictions within three years tests the US shippers' commitment to liber- alisation. The US would have to give up its cargo-sharing deals with Argentina and Bra- zil. It would retain its coastal restrictions, including its right under the Jones Act to resort to unilateral trade action but other countries would be able to ask the US to negotiate deals on cabotage rights. One weakness in the Nordic proposal is that it does not tackle the question of closed liner conferences. Another is that at least initially it failed to evoke a favourable reception from the developing countries - and this could lead the US to persist with its view that it can liberalise shipping better by using its own muscle.",

In particular, they are urging the US to improve its offer on tariff reductions, to negotiate constructively on subsidies and to end its dis- crimination against foreign inventions. Mr Carlos Ferrer, Spanish president of the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (Unice), also asked Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, during a meeting in Washing- ton on Monday, to reach an agreement on services cover- ing all sectors, including financial services and shipping. So far the US has sought to have maritime transport excluded from a general agree- ment on services. Mrs Hills had shared Unice's concern about the lack of prog- ress and the need for the talks to be ended as soon as possi- ble, Mr Ferrer said yesterday. On the crucial issue of agri- culture, Mr Ferrer said the Gatt talks should not be subor- dinated to the final drafting of the EC's internal reform of its common agricultural policy.",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard SWEEPING LEGAL changes to stamp out extortionate credit deals were proposed yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading. Sir Gordon Borrie, director- general of fair trading, described such deals as the unacceptable face of consumer credit. His proposals would give the courts power to reopen an unjust credit agreement and would introduce tougher penal- ties for unlicensed money lend- ing, which is already illegal. Sir Gordon wants courts to be able to identify and reopen an unjust credit agreement, even without an application from the borrower. He also wants himself and local authority trading stan- dards officers to be able to apply to the courts to have transactions declared unjust. Sir Gordon said only a minority of credit deals involve exploitation, but the 1974 Con- sumer Credit Act has not pre- vented loan sharks from charg- ing unjust rates of interest, which sometimes carry annual charges equivalent to 1,000 per cent or more. The OFT has even encoun- tered a case in which interest of Â£37.50 was charged on a three-week loan of about Â£100. The OFT report urges tougher penalties for loan sharks. Current maximum pen- alties for unlicensed money- lending are either a fine of Â£2,000 or a two-year jail sen- tence. The report accepts that lend- ers are right to charge higher interest rates to risky custom- ers, but says there are occa- sions on which the price of credit is excessive and so oppressive that no sensible per- son would find it acceptable. The number of extortionate credit cases appears to be small, but each one is a large problem for the borrower con- cerned. Courts have faced a series of financial, cultural and practi- cal obstacles in their efforts to combat extortionate lending. One common difficulty is that the victims of such lending may lack the funds to take cases to court. Another obstacle is that the law gives an unsatisfactory definition of extortionate credit, and the credit market has changed since the law that applies to it was introduced. Unjust credit practices fall into several categories: * rates of interest which are grossly out of line with the pre- vailing .market rate for that kind of credit; * lending that has been secured against a customer's home with high rates of inter- est and high fees, which replace unsecured debt with secured debt but do not pass on the benefit to the borrower, * high-pressure selling tech- niques, such as staying in the customer's home until the agreement is signed or keeping social-security or child-benefit payment books as security against a loan; * falsifying details on credit agreements, using irregular documentation or tying lend- ing to protection insurance or anything else which is said to have been arranged at the bor- rower's request. Sir Gordon's report was yes- terday welcomed by larger spe- cialist credit lenders. Provident Financial, the market leader in credit collected weekly from homes, said it was pleased with the report. \"It seems well argued and we are glad that it focuses on issues other than just the APR, [annual percentage rate] which is only a limited indicator of an unjust credit transaction,\" said Mr Peter Bretherton, the com- pany's director of corporate affairs. Sir Gordon said various steps should be taken before legislation is passed. These include giving greater public- ity to consumers' existing rights to re-open credit agree- ments when they have been flouted by a lender, and tight- ening up on credit licensing to deter loan sharks. The OFT will liaise with other organisations, including local authorities, to alert them to the need for action against loan sharks. Any legal changes will have to conform to guidelines in a recently proposed European Community directive.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Tomkins reports on plans for increased safety on the Jubilee Line extension T HE MESSAGE is famil- iar to regular travellers on the London Under- ground. \"Due to a person under a train, services are suspended,\" crackles the public address sys- tem. \"Passengers are advised to use alternative services where available.\" No one is shocked. Instead, the announcement is greeted with a mixture of callous resentment and anger: for pas- sengers surmise that this is not some appalling accident, but yet another attempted suicide. They are usually right. On average, two people each week end up beneath a London Underground train. The vast majority are trying to kill themselves, though only 55 per cent succeed. Now London Underground appears to have found a rem- edy. When the Jubilee Line extension to the Docklands opens in 1996, two-metre high transparent screens will run the full length of platform edges at stations from West- minster to North Greenwich. Only when trains enter the stations will sliding doors in the screen allow passengers through to the adjacent train doors. The rest of the time, the screens will be impenetrable. If the system works, it could mark the first successful attempt to solve a problem which regularly disrupts the Underground. On average, it takes 36 min- utes to clear up a \"one-under\", as the incidents are known among staff. Unsuccessful sui- cide attempts are particularly time-consuming because of the need to extricate the injured person carefully. Each incident costs an esti- mated Â£50,000-Â£70,000 in wasted time, without counting ripple Mind the gap: screens along platforms on the Jubilee line will prevent passengers from jumping under trains ~J effects of disruption to the rest of the day's services. More importantly, they can have a devastating psychological effect on train operators, some of whom are unable to drive again. 'The problem is neither unique to London Under ground nor new. Railways worldwide have provided peo- ple with a convenient means of dispatching themselves since their invention. In the past, London Under- ground has tried to cut the casualty rate by providing so-called suicide pits at its busiest stations - trenches between the tracks into which people fall instead of being crushed. But although these have cut the fatality rate, they have not altered the number of incidents. In a renewed attack on the problem two years ago, the Underground commissioned a three-year study into the causes and effects of \"one-un- ders\" by the Department of Community Medicine at Lon- don's Charing Cross and West- minster Medical School. Peak hours for incidents are 11.00 to 12.00 and 15.00 to 16.00, according to the department's prelimi- nary findings. Peak days are Mondays; peak months March and May. Most of the incidents involve men under 55. More significantly, there is a correla- tion between high suicide rate stations and those close to psy- chiatric units. According to the depart- ment's Professor Richard Farmer, interviews with survi- vors show that disruption to services is far from their minds. \"They choose the Underground because it is easy: because it is convenient and available, requiring no special preparations or equip- ment,\" he says. \"But most of all, they choose it because they think it will work. \"They are not ambivalent about it: they want to die, and they are convinced that by throwing themselves on to the Underground they will be crushed, or electrified, or both.\" London Underground has toyed with the idea of drawing greater attention to the fact that suicide attempts on its tracks are so often unsuccess- ful, but now technology offers a means of prevention. Previously the idea of screening off platforms has not been feasible because of the difficulty of ensuring that trains stop with train and plat- form doors correctly aligned. The more sophisticated train control systems being installed on the Jubilee Line, however, will overcome this. If success- ful, the system could be incor- porated into planned moderni- sation of the Central and Northern lines. London Underground will not be the first system to experiment with screens. They were introduced on the auto- mated metro which opened in Lille, France, in 1983 and were also incorporated into the Sing- apore underground system which opened four years ago. In Singapore, they were introduced as an adjunct to the air-conditioning system to stop cool air on stations and trains mixing with hot air in tunnels. But since their introduction, the Singapore underground has not suffered a suicide. Lon- don Underground hopes the Jubilee Line will follow that example.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Hughes, Law Courts Correspondent CLIENTS from the Middle East were defrauded of millions of dollars by an investment adviser who made false promises and used their money for his own and his companies' purposes, it was alleged at Southwark Crown Court, London, yesterday. Mr Mahmoud Sabbagh faces 25 charges including theft of nearly $2.8m (Â£1.65m) from investors, false account- ing and offences under the 1979, Bank- ing Act. He denies all the charges. Mr James Curtis, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Sabbagh owned and controlled the Natracom group of companies in the UK. He induced investors to deposit large amounts of money with Natracom Finance and Funds Management by misrepresenting its standing, offering to invest their funds and guaranteeing them a return. But only a fraction of the funds were invested in depositors' names. Those investments were themselves sold, and the proceeds - together with other investors' funds - were used mainly to reduce Natra group companies' debts. Some funds invested by later clients were used to repay earlier ones. Mr Curtis alleged that money deposited by the main investor, Mr Ahmed Beh Abdullah Al-Misnad, was used to repay a different group of investors. That was done with a large series of bank loans transferred between Natra companies and secured by Mr Al-Misnad's deposit. Mr Curtis alleged that investors' money was also used to finance Mr Sab- bagh's lavish lifestyle, which included a \"grand\" house, three Rolls-Royces and flamboyant entertaining. He said Mr Sabbagh had maintained a pretence throughout that all the funds were being invested for depositors, who were sent false statements of account. The trial, which is expected to last three months, continues today.",

The findings of the survey, undertaken for chartered accountants Grant Thornton, represent \"bad news indeed\" for the motor industry and its dealers, Mr Preston Ayres, chairman of Grant Thornton's motor retailing advisory group, said yesterday. The survey, of 203 private companies. with turnovers of between gim and Â£50m, found that N8 per cent singled out cattng back on the provision of company cars and delaying their replaement a the most effective way of saving money. That compared with 51 per qaet citing cutbacks on busi- ness entertainment, 49 per cent reducing advertising bud- gets and 32 per cent reducing travel expenditure. The survey suggests that it will be \"many years\" before the UK new car market retutns to the record 2.8m units recorded in 1989. Further evidence that the rate of company car replace- ment has slowed is provided by the latest annual guide on UK management remuneration free Monks Partnership, the pay coasultants.

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff THE FOCpS for government and employers must now be quality, not quantity, of female representation. in the work- force, the;Equal Opportunities Commission stressed yesterday at the launch of its annmal review of the comparative posi- tions of women and men. Britain, with 43 per cent, now boasts a higher proportion of women in the workforce than any EC country except Denmark, but the earnings gap between'the sexes remains higher than elsewhere and dis- parities in job opportunities are still marked. The EOC's review provides a unique snapshot of women's continuing disadvantage at work. The gap between male and female hourly earnings for full-time workers has narrowed since 1987, after remaining rea- sonably static for much of the 1980s. The latest figures (for 1990) show that women who worked full-time earned, on average, 77 per cent of the hourly earnings of male full- timers. In 1987 the figure was 73 per cent. However, when it comes to comparing weekly rather than hourly earnings, the gap has remained much wider: women still earn well under 70 per cent of their male counter- parts' wages, because men work longer hours and are more likely to be able to earn overtime and shift premium payments. In addition, part-time female workers continue to earn even lower average hourly rates than full-timers, and this gap has widened over the past few years. Women predominate in part-time jobs: 43 per cent of women compared with 8 per cent of men. The EOC says that much of the difference between male and female earnings comes about as a result of poor mater- nity leave provision and a lack of childcare facilities. Women commonly drop out of the workforce altogether for between three and five years when they have children, returning to lower-paid, part-time jobs. An estimated 40 per cent to 50 per cent of working women are ineligible for maternity rights. This is because the qualifications for maternity leave - as well as for other types of employment protec- tion, such as redundancy pay and unfair dismissal - are two or more years' continuous ser- vice with the same employer and a working week of 16 or more hours, or eight or more hours per week with five years' service. The picture of men and women at work in the 1990s remains very much one where e sexes is higher than elsewhere in the EC the sexes are employed in dif- ferent sectors, different indus- tries, different occupations and at different levels. About 65 per cent of the UK working population is employed in services, 33 per cent in industry and 2 per cent in agriculture. Across the EC as a whole, with the exception of Greece and Portugal, at least two-thirds of female employ- ment is in the service sector. Women form the minority in most manufacturing industries - for example, making up only 33 per cent in electrical and electronic engineering. At the same time they form the majority in many service industries - for instance they are 81 per cent of the work- force in medical and other health services. On segregation by occupa- tion, 52 per cent of all non- manual workers are women, compared with the 53 per cent of men who are in manual Jobs. Some progress has been made on improving the repre- sentation of women in manage- ment and professional occupa- tions - women now make up around 27 per cent in these areas. However, men continue to dominate senior management ranks, with women comprising only about 4 per cent of senior and middle management posi- tions and 1 per cent or 2 per cent of senior executives. Where comparisons can be made - notably with France, Germany and the Netherlands UK differentials between male and female earnings are wider by up to 10 percentage points for both manufacturing and service industries. Different workforce struc- tures, classification systems and ways of collecting data mean that it is not possible to compare UK earnings differen- tials with all other EC coun- tries. Compared with the 43 per cent of the UK workforce which is female, women make up 45 per cent in Denmark. The EC average is 38 per cent. At the same time, however, the UK has more part-time workers than any other EC country and, after the Nether- lands, the highest proportion of female part-timers. On the issue of statutory maternity leave, women in all other EC countries apart from the UK have the right to return to work after having a baby. UK maternity leave is long - 11 weeks before birth and 29 weeks after, compared with between 14 and 16 weeks in most EC countries. However, women in five EC counties are eligible to receive 100 per cent of earnings for 13-16 weeks, compared with 90 per cent of earnings for six weeks in the UK. Women and Men in Britain 1991.

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent LABOUR yesterday unveiled plans for a national housing bank to provide funds that would allow the homeless to biy properties, and an emer- gency mortgage rescue pack- age to halt home reposses- sions. The housing policy initia- tive, called A Welcome Home, would also allow councils to begin a phased release of an estimated Â£5bn in capital receipts from council house sales, currently held in frozen accounts, for a building pro- gramme. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment spokesman, said that government policies had meant fewer homes had been built in the 1980s than in any peacetime decade this cen- tury. Labour's programme intended to help \"kickstart the economy\" while providing pragmatic means for reviving the rented, council-tenanted and owner-occupied sectors. The document, however, concedes that \"considerable work\" is still necessary to assess the financial cost of the programme. Central to the proposals are plans for a national housing bank aimed at providing coun- cils, housing associations and non-residential private land- lords with a stable source of low-cost loans. Operating as a wholesale bank, it would take over the funding functions of the Hous- ing Corporation, which pro- vides finance for housing asso- ciations, and could in time take up the functions of the Public Works Loan Board. Housing subsidies would, how- ever, be provided by the Trea- sury and the Department of the Environment. On the mortgage rescue package, Mr Gould said that a series of measures were envis- aged, including a \"mortgages- into-rents\" scheme that would allow over-borrowed house- owners to reduce their out- goings without having to leave their properties. * Just 12 per cent of Labour activists rate Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, as an effec- tive front bench performer, according to a poll of constitu- ency secretaries by Socialist, a fortnightly radical newspaper launched today. Asked to rate the most effec- tive Labour frontbenchers, with no limit on the number they could name, party work- ers gave the following ratings: Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, 58 per cent; Mr Gordon Brown, the trade spokesman, 50 per cent; Mr Robin Cook, the health spokes- man, and Mr Tony Blair, the employment spokesman - both 33 per cent; Mr John Prescott, the transport spokes- man, 19 per cent, Ms Margaret Beckett, the treasury spokes- woman, 14 per cent and Mr Kinnock and Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman - both 12 per cent.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor THE CONSERVATIVES yester- day put the claim that a Labour administration would need to raise the basic rate of income tax by lo0p to meet its spending commitments at the heart of their attack on the opposition's economic strategy. Launching a detailed analy- sis of Labour's tax and spend- ing pledges, Mr Norman Lam- ont, the chancellor, said he had found a Â£25bn gap between what the opposition had prom- ised to spend and what it planned to raise in extra taxes. That gap could only be plugged if the basic rate of tax was raised from 25p to 35p. The result would be to push up the bills of \"ordinary taxpayers\" earning between Â£10,000 and Â£20,000 a yeak by about Â£25 per week. Those- earning between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000 would see their bills rise by twice that amount and even thode earn- ing less than Â£10,000 would face a Â£300 increase in their annual bills. As the clatter of a phoney election war continued to echo around Westminster, the arith- metic was dismissed by Labour. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, insisted that a future Labour govern- ment would not raise the basic rate of tax. He went on to accuse the Tories of lying about past increases in value added tax, predicting a further rise in VAT from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent if the govern- ment were re-elected. Mr Lamont in turn responded with a demand that Mr Smith outline in detail Lbdur's proposed new system I of income tax bands and spec- ifwhich of Labour's spending I pledges might be dropped. i The Conservative calcula- tions were based on the assess- I ment that by the last year of the next parliament - 1995/96 - Mr Smith would be spending Â£3bn a year more than a Con- I servative chancellor. This assessment has been rejected by-Labour. That figure was put along- side a projection, run through - Inland Revenue computers, of I the money that would be raised by the planned tax increases that Labour has pub- licly announced. Those included the proposed increase in the top rate of tax to 50 per cent, abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and its extension to unearned income, and restrictions to the basic rate of a range of income tax allow- ances. Labour had also detailed plans to abolish the capital gains tax allowance, increase inheritance tax and freeze the married man's allowance. Mr Lamont said this \"grim list\" would have a \"devastat- ing\" impact on hundreds of thousands of taxpayers but it represented only the \"tip of the iceberg\". The Inland Revenue projections had shown that by 1995/96 the cumulative impact of the eight planned rises would be to add Â£10bn to gov- ernment revenues. The Â£25bn gap between that and spending pledges represented Labour's \"hidden agenda\" to push up the tax bills of all taxpayers.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Evans on poster adverts in general election campaigns CERTAIN sign that pre-election fever has arrived is the coyness with which parties are pre- pared to discuss the advertis- ing campaigns they will mount once the date is announced. Poster campaigns have already been launched by the Conservative and Labour par- ties, but the scale of advertis- ing will increase markedly when the starting pistol is fired by Mr John Major, the prime minister. There will be an immediate scramble by advertising agents representing the parties for poster sites and strategically placed hoardings. Until the date is announced, the parties and their agents keep in touch with poster com- panies to see what might be available, and when. That phase in the process has been continuing with varying inten- sity since the spring, and it has increased sharply in recent weeks as the chances of a November poll have appeared to grow. Posters have been an inte- gral part of election campaign- ing in recent years. The Con- servative poster of 1979 entitled Labour Isn't Working, with its picture of a snaking queue of the unemployed, was acknowl- edged as a particularly success- ful attack. The Conservatives have tended to place more emphasis than Labour and the Liberal Democrats on poster cam- paigns, largely because of their extra cash and their support among other heavy advertisers such as brewers and tobacco companies. The party has already prepared contingency plans for grabbing hundreds of poster sites when the election date is known. There are no guarantees, though. The message from the industry is emphatic: it all depends what is available. Mr Michael Horner, sales director of Mills & Allen, part of the French Avenir Havas media group, says: \"The rules are very simple. It is done on a first-come, first-served basis . . .it depends entirely on what has been booked and what remains available.\" That is absolutely right in theory, but in practice there are two reasons why space is always available. First, the Central Office of Information (COI), a government body, usu- ally has campaigns in progress on privatisation, health, educa- tion or other issues. But all government advertising is halted when an election is called, and space taken by the COI goes back on the market. Second, the parties are at lib- erty to bid for any free space or to approach companies that have already booked space in order to do a deal. Labour claims that big brewers and tobacco companies, tradition- ally big supporters of the Bare bones of the matter: Labour is relying on strong images to get its election message across to tne voters 'Tories, are only too happy to transfer their hoarding and poster space in an emergency. However, the present indica- tions are that the parties will have much greater difficulty in mounting a campaign this autumn than they would next spring. After a poor summer, the poster companies now report a buoyant fourth quar- ter, with little space available at short notice. Mr Simon Halden, joint man- aging director of Maidens Out- door Advertising, agrees. \"We are already sold out in October and November is going fast . . . the Conservatives will have to beg, borrow or steal from other advertisers who have already booked space.\" In spite of the improvement, Ms Lorna Tilbian, an analyst at Warburgs, reckons that the market remains short-term and that space will be available for the general election. \"The industry is hoping either for a general election or for the HT flotation to boost its fourth quarter,\" she says. The industry is dominated by three groups. They are Mills & Allen, the biggest, with about a third of the total; More O'Ferrall and Maidens with 15 per cent to 20 per cent each; and British Transport Adver- tising and National Solus with smaller shares. Costs vary greatly according to size, position and demand. An average 48-sheet advertise- ment, measuring 20ft by 10ft, could cost Â£250 to Â£350 a month. A prime \"super-site\" such as those in Cromwell Road in west London costs up to Â£2,000 a month, but the polit- ical parties normally buy pack- ages rather than single sites. What impact an intensive poster campaign will have on the election result will have to be judged by the psephologists. However, there is a vivid mem- ory of what happened at the last election. Labour, by com- mon consent, ran the more effective campaign, but that did not stop the Conservatives cruising to a 100-seat majority.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Pike, Social Affairs Correspondent A SECOND church leader yes- terday criticised the govern- ment's education policy, only days after a controversial speech on the same subject by Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury. Cardinal Basil Hume, archbishop of Westminster and leader of England's Roman Catholics, spoke of a \"grave danger\" that many of the least fortunate young people in the community would be taught by an education system that was deteriorating in qual- ity. He said in a speech - deliv- ered, like Dr Carey's last week, to a head teachers' conference - that the fundamental objec- tive of ensuring that each young person received the best possible education was \"being brought into question by the introduction of greater paren- tal choice and competition in the education system\". There was a risk that the choice would not lie with par- ents to choose schools, but with popular schools which would be able to choose between children. Cardinal Hume attacked the idea of comparing schools on the basis of examination results. Many, particularly those in the inner cities, would be unfairly judged on this basis, he said. He described as extraordi- nary the way in which \"grant- maintained schools are quite openly being more generously funded than their counterparts in the maintained sector\". Schools were being allowed to opt out of local authority control in ways that frustrated councils' ability to plan strate- gically. * The government has dropped plans to-halt funding for adult evening classes in subjects such as aerobics and pottery. Mr Kenneth Clarke, educa- tion secretary, said yesterday that money would be made available for such courses. His decision came after a vigorous campaign by organisations such as the Women's Insti- tutes. Editorial comment, Page 22",

   "text_content" : "By John Hunt, Environment Correspondent WATER companies will be prevented from polluting rivers with sewage works discharges under measures announced by i the National Rivers Authority, i the pollution watchdog. Stricter measures are also 1 being introduced that will affect other sectors of industry. The NRA said: \"It is a signal to managements that they 1 must take a more responsible role over discharges and treat them as seriously as they I would any other part of their business.\" The NRA has written to water companies saying it is ending the \"wholly unaccept- able situation\" that enabled sewage treatment works to grossly pollute rivers without fear of prosecution as long as the incidents were infrequent. The so-called \"95 per cent\" sys- tem required water companies to meet pollution control requirements for only 95 per cent of discharges. The method was introduced to smooth the path for water privatisation. The NRA said that from now the companies will have to comply with absolute limits. The Water Services Associa- tion, which represents the com- panies, said it could not yet say what this would cost. The NRA also said that total limits will be put on the amount of substances, such as heavy metals, that can be dis- charged. Companies will have to appoint a manager to over- see discharges into rivers. * Lord Crickhowell, NRA chairman, yesterday saw Mr John Major, the prime minis- ter, about the authority's future and urged that it should not be broken up as part of the formation of a national envi- ronmental protection agency. Mr Major confirmed that a bill setting up the new agency would not be introduced before the general election. Ivor Owen writes: Govern- ment plans for establishing the environmental protection agency had been delayed by \"squabbles\" between ministers, the Labour party alleged last night. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow minister for environmental protection, complained that government inaction was put- ting the nation's health at risk.",

   "text_content" : "By Charles Bathelor THE government must take action to counter the loss of up to 100,000 farmnning jobs over the next decade, the Rural Devel- opment Commission warned yesterday. The commission, which advises the government on rural issues, has concentrated its resources on specific areas facing particular problems such as the rural coalfield areas of the east Midlands. But the commission requires 4 \"additional resources from gov- 1 ernment to be effective on a i wider front,\" Lord Shuttle- i worth, commission chairman, said in his annual report. One in five of the English population lives or works in the countryside and many face I difficulties in a climate of 1 urban-dominated policy- making, the report noted. A sample survey of self- 1 employed people and small businesses on the commis- sion's client list revealed that more than 50 per cent were in difficulties and that half of those needed help. In response, the commission launched an advisory package to help companies cope with the recession The main probi lems of rural small businesses were found to be faling order books, cashlow and liquidity problems, high interest rates and slow payments by debtors. The report said that the com- mission needs to coordinate its business advisory services with the enterprise support provided by the Training and Enterprise Councils. The commission has held meetings with Training and Enterprise Councils and sup- ports the creation of a consor- tium of rural Tecs.",

   "text_content" : "By John Willman and Allson Smith THE government yesterday refused-to increase next year's spending limits for local authorities in England and Wales by any more than the 7.2 per cent rise announced in July. Leaders of council organisa- tions emerged from a 90-minute meeting at the Department of the Environ- ment warning that the govern- ment's refusal would mean more cuts in services. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, after- wards dismissed the claims as \"the customary plea for more\". He pointed out that the 7.2 per cent increase in what the gov- ernment thought councils should spend was considerably more than the projected infla- tion level. He also rejected a plea by Mr John Chatfield, Tory chairman of the Association of County Councils, for the abolition of the 20 per cent minimum poll tax that students and people on income support must pay. Mr Chatfield, leader of East Sussex County Council, said that it did not make business sense, as it cost more to collect than it brought in. However, Mr Portillo said the government did not believe in changing the rule to exempt people on the lowest incomes. Councils must continue to pur- sue those who had not paid, he added. He insisted that the council tax, the property-based tax that will replace the poll tax, was on course for introduction in April 1993, and that it would be much simpler for councils to administer. Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging him to review the revenue support grant set- tlement, which he said \"short- changed\" local government; to scrap the 20 per cent contribu- tion rule immediately; and to publish the council tax legisla- tion. \"These three steps are now the minimum required if we are to avoid yet another poll tax crisis for the third year in a row,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "John Wilkins explains the impact of forthcoming changes to VAT regulations to take account of the single market project ia changes are planned in. the way VAT is applied to trade between EC member states. From the end of 1992 there will be no fiscal controls at borders and a new system will be introduced for checking the pay- ment of VAT on companies' imports. There will be obvious bene- fits for business - and some unpleapant surprises. At present, when goods are imported, VAT must be paid in order to get the goods into the coun- try; they can be examined for this purpose. In practice, the procedure is streamlined, and a&trader who can provide the authorities with the necesary safeguards is usually allowedctto postpone payment. From January 1 1993, however, goods from one EC country will be entitled to enter another without any formalities at all. The 54-box form, called the Single Administra- tive Document, or SAD, which trad- ers have to fill in at present for every consignment entering or leav- ing the country, will not be required for imports from, and' exports to, the EC. The tax on imports will be entered as a liability on the importer's next VAT return, where it will normally also qualify for refund; so no net payment will arise and the importer's cash flow will benefit from the elimination of any time lag between paying VAT on imports and being given credit for it. So much for imports. The compli- cations start to arise on exports. At present VAT is not charged on exported goods, but after 1992 this will only apply in the EC if the purchaser is registered for VAT. Sellers will have to quote the cus- tomer's VAT number on each invoice; they will need to obtain this information towards the end of 1992 and keep it up to date. In some of the other member states new VAT numbers may be needed. Com- puter programmers and those designing or ordering forms and sta- tionery should note that all VAT numbers will probably have a prefix indicating the member state. What will happen if an unregis- tered purchaser in one member state tricks a seller in another mem- ber state into zero-rating the.sale by giving a bogus VAT numberhIn the UK, if the seller acts with reason- able care and the goods leave the country, Customs and Excise will not normally hold him liable for the VAT and will notify the tax admin- istration of the other member state. Other new requirements will involve changes to accounting and record-keeping systems: * Exporters will have to provide their government with a return for each quarter ishowing the total sales to each registered customer in another member state. They must be able, on request, to give the amounts of the separate invoicesa description of the goods and their price. When goods are moved tem- porarily from one member state to another, for example to be repaired, the records must provide a check that the goods return to the original member state. * In addition to the quarterly cus- tomer listing, the largest of import- ers and exporters will have to provide their government's statis- tics office with monthly returns of goods moving between the UK and. other member states regardless of the nature of the transaction. This is because the SAD will no longer be in use to provide the information. The return will be ..less detailed than the SAD and should prove to ul *ny mIuonni ----~----- -- -------- --IC~ ---'--C1'- -- ~--- --~----------- Â·mr Â·r be a lighter burden. Although the return will ask for totals, country by country and commodity by com- modity, companies will be allowed to simplify their procedures if they wish by giving the information in untotalled form for each separate consignment and by having the work done by forwarding agents as part of their handling of the paper- work. Without these concessions the return could be a serious prob- lem. 0 The VAT return will contain two new boxes from the beginning of 1992. They will show the value of goods sold and delivered to other member states, and of goods pur- chased and delivered to the UK from other member states. This information is intended to help Cus- toms plan for the new system before 1993 and identify companies that are to make the statistical return. There are other complications too: * There is some uncertainty about how the new rules will apply in three-country transactions - where, for example, a wholesaler in member state B buys from a pro- ducer in member state A, resells to a retailer in member state C and has the goods delivered direct from A to C. The wholesaler's VAT posi- tion is unclear, and the producer's quarterly listing could result in the price paid by the wholesaler becom- Aing known to the retailer. UK Cus- toms are looking for ways of remov- ing this danger. * At present all exports are zero- rated regardless of who the cus- tomer is. Inside the EC this will change; exports to registered trad- ers will remain zero-rated, as already explained, but exports to private persons and non-registered traders will become liable to VAT only in the exporting country, sub- ject to two important exceptions. The first exception is where a business sells to a private person and delivers to his or her address. If these sales to another member state exceed about Â£70,000 a year, the company will owe VAT to that country. In the upecial case of mail order, the threshold may be less than Â£70,000. The system will entail extra records and possibly the appointment of a fiscal representa- tive in the other member state. The second exception is new road vehicles, boats and aircraft. The purchaser will owe VAT in the country where the new vehicle is registered and the seller will have to provide the information to ensure that this is done. - At present, hauliers do not charge VAT on the carriage of goods between different countries, but from 1993 this will change for carriage between member states. If the person who wants the goods moved - the haulier's cus- tomer - is registered in the mem- ber state where,the carriage starts or finishes and the haulier is in the same member state, the haulier (having ascertained all this) will charge VAT. In most other cases the customer will owe the VAT to the tax depart- ment. Either way the customer will normally be entitled to recover the VAT as input tax. There will be greater co-operation between member states' tax depart- ments and there is a danger of less protection for companies' trade secrets. Under the present directive a member state need not disclose a taxpayer's trade secret, and any national prohibition against disclo- sure, as in the UK, prevails. New rules, contained in a regulation which will take precedence over UK law, will provide that the sole grounds for refusing another mem- ber state's request is \"public pol- icy\", which may not always cover a trade secret. Will the advantages of the new system outweigh the disadvan- tages? The full details of how it will be implemented in the various member states, including the associ- ated penalties, are not yet known, I but three general points can be i made. I First, there will in future be three, not two, systems. At present there is one system for sales of goods entirely inside the UK and a I separate system for goods leaving or entering the UK. The new system for trade with the rest of the EC is radically different from either. Second, the Commission sees the new system as temporary. It hopes to change later to a system under t which VAT will always be charged f on goods sent to another member state, even to a registered trader. It hopes that this will come into force at the beginning of 1997, although it > may be later because a method has still to be worked out for passing on the tax that will be charged on i trade sales to the purchasing trad- , er's government. r Third, traders and Customs have I very little time in which to get the necessary organisational, account- ing and computer changes in place. Assuming the EC legislation is fina- liUsed soon and draft UK legislation is published in October for consulta- tion, it will not be until the Finance i Bill is published next April that business will have a basis on which to act. So long as clauses in the bill are not substantially amended, a clear eight months will remain. L The changes will get rid of some i important hindrances to cross- border trade and companies should be ready to exploit new opportuni- ties. But they also need to prepare i for new complications and make : sure that, overall, they come out i winners. The author is a consultant to the Institute of Directors.",

   "text_content" : "arlier this month a group of Greenpeace activists emerged from the early-morn- ing gloom on the Cumbrian coast with a specially engi- neered plug. They used it to stop most of the flow from the 8m gallons-a-day discharge pipe at the Albright & Wilson detergent and phosphate facto- ries near Whitehaven. The action, which forced the company to close six of its plants temporarily, came only weeks after Greenpeace won a private prosecution against A&W for exceeding legal emis- sion limits into the Irish Sea, the first such case in the UK. Greenpeace's commando raid on Whitehaven, which A&W called \"utmost lunacy\", was merely another step in the environmental group's long- running campaign against the company, a subsidiary of the US conglomerate Tenneco, and against the National Rivers Authority (NRA) which it believes should take a tougher line on pollution. The battle highlights the profound difficulties that industry faces when con- fronted by environmental groups - mainly based on the misunderstanding of the group's ultimate objectives. \"There's a horrifying irratio- nality about it all,\" says John Pickup of A&W's corporate affairs department. Greenpeace would, natu- rally, disagree. \"We look at a company as part of the system and we go for the weakest point. We try to chop off a foot if possible,\" says Steve Elsworth of Greenpeace. This might explain why A&W is limping a little. Green- peace has yet to sever the offending limb but it has caused cosiderable distress to the company in terms of bad publicity, legal costs and exec- utive time. A&W's most recent move ws to obtain an injunc- tion forbidding Greenpeace from interfering with its Greenpeace's campaign is centred on the A&W's dis- cae ipe near Whitbaven, an envlrn-mihtal fIlm-maker's dream. Described in court a \"dypeplic dragon\", it froths and spits vast quantities of white water ' aaintag heavy metals into the a, creting a slck tht is visible for mdes hom M aeroplae. Syou were looking to cop fs 0w11 Odf trOsb ho, them AMW's pie is a gift bom the gods. 'I nstantly looks wreg, says Tim the wpign s st A AW. c pafsa ALtM. There is, however, nothing officially wrong with A&W's discharge. It is monitored regu- larly by the company and the NRA, which has not prose- cuted the company. \"We have never imposed a load on the environment above our con- sent level,\" says Pickup. But herein lies the rub that is a feature of most confronta- tions between campaign groups and industry. No mat- ter how many times the com- pany may wish to underline that it is sticking to the rules, it is, within the nature of the environmental campaign, sticking to the wrong rules. Greenpeace sees itself, according to Elsworth, as a \"solicitor for the environ- ment\". The group does not agree with the consent levels set out by the NRA, nor with the way they are enforced. It has targeted A&W because the company provides the most visible symbol of what Green- peace views as industry's rape of the environment. Other companies might be polluting more, but A&W's \"dyspepsic dragon\" enables Greenpeace to communicate its message to the public with rel- ative ease. And by casting the company as the villain, Green- peace invariably succeeds in holding the high moral ground. While industry might be suc- cessful at getting high court injunctions and reasonably proficient at arguing the scien- tific case to other scientifically minded people, it usually loses the communications battle. There are two reasons for this. First, it is inexperienced at communicating with the Greenpmac cuvist blocking a dicharge pipe at Albright A WIMon's Whitaoven actory evrlier Ihi month t public. And second, the cam. paigners have an exclusive hold on emotion, the communi- cator's most powerful tool. Industry is often nonplussed by the strength of emotions. It feels aggrieved that scientific and business arguments are often disregarded by the pub. lic. A&W, for example, tries to defend itself on scientific grounds. \"There is no future in ignoring the science,\" says Pickup. It also retreats into commer- cial confidentiality clauses when asked why it has not killed its \"dyspepsic dragon\". And the company's assertions that it is doing its utmost to improve its environmental per- formance ahead of the legal requirements are rejected by Greenpeace as empty promises. This leads A&W, and others who have been attacked by environmental groups, to com- plain that the groups are always moving the goalposts. Once they have chopped off the foot, they move on to the next limb and continue until they have fully exploited their tar- get - or the cmpany removes itself from the firing line by Mpvi its performance or its posion. There is no way to measure the commercial effects of con- frontations. Pickup ays the campaign against Ad&W has not damagd the company's markets. \"I an Irritation and a waste of our time but we have not experienced a com- mercial downside because of this,\" he aexpins. Even so, it woul seem sensi- ble to try to avoid coofrota- tin. One strategy is to build brides with those whold an oppodng point of view.

   "text_content" : "Alan Pike reports on a change of emphasis in health provision at one of the first NHS trust hospitals ndy Black, chief execu- tive of London's Central Middlesex hospital, points to a photograph on his office wall of forbidding- looking nurses in starched uniforms and morning dress- clad doctors. \"That was taken in 1934 when the patient was regarded as the passive, ignorant object of medical care. The nurse ordered you to get into bed and not crumple the sheets. The doctor told you to stand up and sit down. Well, there's still an element of that attitude around today and we are going to change things.\" When the Central Middlesex became one of the first self-governing trusts under the government's National Health Service reforms in April, Black and Dr Martin McNicol, his chairman, announced plans to turn it into a patient-focused hospital. In April, the words probably sounded to staff little more than a slogan. Managers throughout the NHS are brush- ing up on their customer-care techniques, recognising that in a consumer society people are becoming less inclined to toler- ate attitudes and standards iiin hospital which they would reject in hotels and shops. But Black and McNicol have begun unveiling plans which go far beyond a customer rela- tions exercise and envisage the complete restructuring of the way in which the Central Mid- dlesex is managed and delivers services to patients. Only about 10 per cent of the hospital's patients are admit- ted to the wards - the major- ity attend only for out-patient consultations or day surgery. Yet like most hospitals, every- thing about the Central Mid- dlesex, from the design of its buildings to the way it is staffed and managed, focuses on the in-patient aspects of its work. The trust management intends to reverse this by reor- ganising the hospital around at least 14 ambulatory centres. Some of these would cover dis- tinct specialist medical and surgical activities while others - like elderly and rehabilita- tion services - would be broader groupings. A family care centre, combining obstet- rics, paediatrics and gynaecol- ogy, is a possibility. Formation of the centres would provide Black and McNicol with a ground-plan for pressing ahead with the next, more radical stage of their changes - the provision of treatment on team-based, cross-boundary principles. Centres would have their own facilities for investigation, therapy and minor surgery. Instead of patients being sent on long journeys around the hospital for blood-tests or X-rays, all except complex pathology and radiology work would be carried out in each centre. The change would make redundant many of the NHS's traditional professional demar- cation lines. Nurses, rather than specialist staff in the pathology and radiology departments, would handle straightforward X-rays and blood tests. Multi-skilled clinical teams would operate across existing boundaries and the concept of discrete operating theatre, out- patient, ward and day unit staff would disappear. The re-allocation of work within the centres would be accompanied by the introduc- tion of a clearly managed approach to patient care. A specified member of staff would become responsible for managing each patient's entire visit. Whenever possible, assessment and treatment would take place during a sin- gle appointment. When a fur- ther visit was needed, the same staff member would be allo- cated to the case again. Patients would leave the hos- pital with clear written infor- mation about their treatment to take to their GPs. Dedicated telephone lines would enable GPs to have easy consultations with staff in the centres. If successful, the changes will give patients a more con- venient and personalised ser- vice. But Black stresses that these consumerist aspects of the plans, while welcome, are incidental to the hospital man- agement's over-riding belief that they will provide better standards of medical and nurs- ing care. Many organisations have expressed interest in the Cen- tral Middlesex proposals. They are attracting the attention of senior Department of Health oficials, local health authori- ties, GPs and the medical royal colleges - the Royal College of Physicians has agreed to help assess the effects of the pro- posed new care arrangements. But gaining staff support for implementation will not be easy. The NHS is rich in inter- est groups - among both its professional and unskilled staff - who are likely to feel threat- ened by the proposed shift to a multi-skilled, generic style of patient care. McNicol is devoting two- thirds of his time as trust chairman to implementing the project. His position as a for- mer consultant at the Central Middlesex will be crucial in winning support of his miedical colleagues. \"We have to cot- vince people the changes we are proposing are appropriate and feasible, and that they have the responsibility and power to carry them forward,\" he says.",

Arthur D Little, the US consultancy, came to that conclusion after studying the market pros- pects for fuel cells. They \"may be one of the critical technologies which will allow for the expanded use of energy services that are com- patible with maintaining the environmental integrity of the planet,\" Brian Barnett of Arthur D Little told a conference in London yesterday. A fuel cell works like a battery, producing electricity from the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. The difference is that a battery contains chemicals which store energy; it has to be recharged or discarded when the energy is used up. A fuel cell is fed continuously with hydrogen and oxygen and will generate electicity for us long as the gases go through it. In practice, fuel cells take oxygen fom the air. The hydrogen can come from a wide vari- ety of hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas and oil; these are d broken down into a. hydrogen-rich gas in a reformer\" and then fed into the cell.

It forecasts that by 2000 the total capacity of fuel cells installed will exceed 4,000 MW per year - about 5 per cent of all new generating capacity. According to Barnett, a combination of three factors will create a mass market for fuel cells: * Continued progress in technology. A new generation of fuel cells will operate at high temperatures, converting hydrocarbon gas directly to hydrogen without the need for a separate reformer. An example is the solid oxide fuel cell running at 1,000 deg C, which Westing- house is developing in the US in a $140m (E80m) programme funded by industry and the Depart- ment of Energy. * The emergence of large-scale manufacturing capability. Manufac- turers have recently founded the World Fuel Cell Council to promote the technol- ogy. Japanese compa- nies, notably Toshiba and Fuji Electric, have taken the lead. * Most importantly, the environmental advantages of fuel cells. The fuel cell industry now has orders for more than 100 plants worldwide. They range from Fuji's 50kW units, designed to supply heat and power to omces, hotels and small factories, up to an 11 MW power plant which started operating in Tokyo this year.

   "text_content" : "radio waves and microwaves, it is the foundation on which business and industry rely. Andrew Jack looks at a market expecting a turnover of more than $8bn by 1993 *) -- Â· Â· Â·- Â· 5 The ubiquitous Dar code is only the most visible aspect of auto ID. Together with magnetic stripes, a C6= AUTOMATIC identification is one of the most widespread yet least understood industries in existence. The name means lit- tle to those outside the sector, but its applications are every- where. Auto ID is essentially the entry into computers of data without the need for key- strokes. Two of its most com- mon manifestations are the bar code on retail products and the magnetic stripe on the back of credit cards. The industry remains youth- ful, with a market turnover this year estimated at more than $3.6 billion in Europe and the USA alone, and still grow- ing phenomenally fast. There are few aspects of life which auto ID does not touch. A shopper entering a super- market, for example, sees bar codes on every purchase, which are scanned at the checkout to generate a price. The code is also giving the store instant information about the depletion of its stock, allowing it to manage invento- ries more efficiently. Meanwhile the customer is likely to be paying the bill by cheque, credit card, or cash drawn out with a bank card: all of which use magnetic stripe or ink recognition auto ID techniques. If someone attempts to leave a shop with goods they have not paid for, an alarm may well go off at the exit, triggered by a security tag - an applica- tion of radio frequency auto ID. More sophisticated retailers are now experimenting with ways to sell the lists of the products each customer buys to the manufacturers of the goods - or their competitors - for direct marketing. Clearly the technologies have spawned a wide variety of uses. While retailers remain by far the largest and most visible users, auto ID occurs increas- ingly in financial services, manufacturing, distribution, security and the public sector. Bar codes represent more than three quarters of the auto ID market, and are now printed on many factory com- ponents, ballot papers and offi- cial documents as well as innu- merable consumer goods. Last Saturday, the Financial Times joined three other UK national quality newspapers - The Guardian, the Independent and The Times - by introduc- Some applications border on the futuristic and the bizarre ing bar codes to help speed retailing and distribution. Sev- eral tabloid newspapers have been using the system for some time. Magnetic stripes are the next most common medium, mainly due to the widespread use of plastic cards issued by banks. Smart cards, containing far more information than tradi- tional magnetic stripes, are also beginning to find a wide range of applications. Radio frequency tags, where a \"transponder\" sends out a. signal when it passes near to a special radio transmitter, are being used in the identification of animals, vehicles and even prisoners. They are especially useful where it is difficult for a scanner to \"see\" or be adjacent to the code to be read. Other segments, including voice recognition and machine vision, occupy more specialist niches, while some - such as the identification of the human retina - border on the futuris- tic and the bizarre, and still face significant technological as well as ethical problems. The growing visibility of dif- ferent forms of auto ID over the past few years has helped the industry boost its image. \"Executives are no longer say- ing 'what are bar codes?' but rather 'how can we use them to improve our business?',\" says Peter Hicks, chairman of Aim (UK), the automatic iden- tification manufacturers' asso- ciation. In the past, the bar code was viewed as a rather strange gim- mick thrust into retailing. Now, he says, \"it has spread like a virus to become an essential computer peripheral. It is a genuine substitute for the keyboard which is recog- nised in many different sec- tors.\" Mr Tomo Razmilovic, chair- man and managing director of Symbol Technologies (Europe), believes that in the 1970s and 1980s, auto ID helped firms to improve productivity and effi- ciency by increasing the speed of existing processes. In the 1990s, the technology is allow- ing them to operate in funda- mentally different ways, such as just-in-time production. At the same time, he says, the industry is switching from being technology-led towards being driven by applications. The trend is reflected in the growing amount of space given at trade exhibitions such as Aim's Scantech to software and systems alongside new hardware. Mike Hendry, managing director of Teconomica, a con- sulting firm which conducts research on the industry for Frost & Sullivan, the market researchers, says there was a steady flow of new products over the past five years. \"Now there is an absence of things you could call new,\" he says. \"People are settling in with existing trends. The technol- ogy leapt a bit too far. The market is catching up.\" Over the coming decade, he points to rapid growth in pub- lic sector projects such as doc ument tracking and health care, many of which take sev no/7 eral years to develop. The electronics industry, feeding on itself, remains a large potential market for bar code technology. The main demand will con- tinue to come from retailing, warehousing and inventory applications. \"These are mature markets, but they have not reached anything like satu- ration yet,\" he says. \"Retailing will remain the biggest for a very long time.\" As a medium, bar codes seem likely to retain their dom- inance on both sides of the Atlantic for many years yet, given their cheapness, reliabil- ity and relative ease.,of use. Radio frequency tagging is growing more quickly than some analysts had predicted, with the benefit that the scan- ner does not have to \"see\" or be right next to the tag. But it is held back by the relatively higher cost of equipment. Mr Hendry says the UK mar- ket has certainly been affected in the last few months by the recession as much as any other business sector. Based on cur- rent trends, however, he expects rapid growth to con- tinue at least over the next four or five years. The picture is similar in the USA, where Keith Everett, a consultant with the Massachu- setts-based Venture Develop- ment Corporation, says the sluggish economy and the maturing of the industry and its technologies have helped to moderate growth rates from the 30 to 40 per cent annual rates in the mid 1980s. While many businesses have made an initial ID investment in perhaps one or two areas of their operation, he says, it requires far more money and serious management commit- ment to integrate it across all of a company's activities. The auto ID market has become sufficiently large to attract acquisitions from exter- nal predators, such as that of Intermec by Litton, the US avi- onics manufacturer, recently, as well as within the industry like that of MSI by Symbol two years ago. He projects that the US mar- ket, including exports over- seas, may be around $4bn by 1994. Over the same period, Frost & Sullivan sees Western European sales growing to $2.4bn over the same period. The industry has made con- siderable steps towards stan- dardisation for bar codes. The guidelines of the Europe-based International Article Numbering Association have been adopted in some 50 countries, while an equivalent Universal Product Code exists in the USA. However, there are as yet no comparable standards for radio frequency and other types of auto ID equipment Producers of scanning equip- ment are also concerned about two recent proposals: one by the German pharmaceutical industry to use red bar codes; and another more generally to use less intrusive invisible ink. Neither can be read using con- ventional laser scanners. Manufacturers have cer- tainly not lost their talent for technological innovations. Ear- lier this year, for instance, Symbol introduced a new two-dimensional bar code with the capacity to store large amounts of data (see page 2). Clearly, new applications are also continuing to develop. The company is one of several to be placing emphasis on bar code scanners which transmit the data by radio waves as soon as it has been read. This will help just-in-time manufacturing, and cut down on the rewiring required in stores where sta- tionary equipment is currently required to download the scan- ners. There is at least one key issue the market still faces, however: to find a name which better suits the industry. The Personal Computer and Data Capture group argues that the the term \"automatic identifica- tion\" does not fairly reflect the uses to which the technology is put. It also, of course, associ- ates the industry with the rival trade body, Aim. \"There really isn't an auto ID market,\" says Mr Hendry. \"It's fabricated.\" Instead, there are many separate markets for each technology, for equipment producing it and devices to read and process it. Tomo Razmilovic suggests distributive data processing. Mr Everett says: \"You can use any phrase you like as long as you define it.\" He prefers the terms \"auto- mated data capture\", or \"machine readable data collec- tion technologies\". The search for the snappy title goes on.",

   "text_content" : "IN DRAMATIC contrast to the chilly climate in many other sectors this year, the European automatic identification indus- try continues to grow steadily. Total revenues are expected to reach $4,000m in 1991. This will represent an increase of 17 per cent over 1990. Forms, labels, tags, cards etc account for nearly half of that, but hardware sales alone will top $1,400m in Europe this year. One reason for this perfor- mance lies in the recession itself. The need for businesses to control costs and to improve efficiency has meant expendi- ture on auto ID is one of the few areas where companies can justify capital outlays. Elimination of manual data capture and paper work by means of auto ID is an obvious labour saver. Furthermore, the increased availability of information at speed, and the increased reli- ability of that information, means better cost control is attainable. Another reason for the growth of the industry is that a critical mass has now been reached. There is increased pressure on companies to implement auto ID technology because of its usage by suppli- ers and customers. For exam- ple, large retail groups increas- ingly require their suppliers to provide bar code ID on the outer casing of cartons and containers as well as on the individual product items being supplied. Once the supplier has imple- mented the bar code labelling process at the insistence of oth- ers, he is well on the way to automatic production control and inventory control as well as automated warehouse man- agement. A desire to improve service is another good reason for auto ID. Luton and Manchester are among airports that have recently Iaplemented systems hfrom Datalogic of Italy to can luggage. Bar coded labels on each piece of luggage are scanned on the conveyor belt to route luggage to the corec flight. This provides an automatic record Unking Igage and des European market: Hardware (value) 53.2% Bar code 55.5% Im.. 1 129% MICR- OCR + MICR Hvbrid LO% 64% OCR 2.4% 10.3% Radio frequency 18.5% 11.5% Magnetic stripe 5.8% 5.0% Smart card 14.1% b Voice recogniton 1.0 Source: Clndon ports Value of software, supples and media excluded I Â·Â·Â·-- Â·I --Â·Â·-Â·Â·-Â·. tination, and handling time is substantially reduced. Increased attention to secu- rity procedures has also bene- sited the industry. Radio fre- quency (RS) based solutions are often used. High frequency microwave solutions, such as those supplied by US compa- nies Senelco and Knogo, use hard reusable tags for clothing, and disposable self-adhesive tags for goods like records and cassettes, in conjunction with detection pedestals at shop exits. Electronic surveillance systems like this are big busi- ness, with the European mar- ket expected to grow to over E300m in 1991. Another security application is that of access control. The Dutch firm Nedap, for exam ple, has installed more than 25,000 RS credit card-sized tage for security applications in London banks alone in the past few years. Simple possession of such a card would allow access to a controlled area. The famil- iar magnetic stripe or bar coded cards offer a lower cost alternative. Access control has the dual function of providing a data base to monitor the number cf persons in a building, useful in case of emergency. Bar coding continues to be the technology which attracts most spending. The unit cost of printing bar codes is low com- pared to RS or smart card costs; and printing processes are sufficiently high to cater for different surfaces and envi- ronments. The continuing effort to get more information into a bar code means more than a thousand characters can now be stored in a symbol. If this new so-called 2-D sym- bology catches on, a host of new application areas will open up to bar code technol- ogy. The fastest growing sector in auto ID is RS, due to its rela- tively high information storage capacity. Further, information can be read and written at a distance: contact-free card/tag systems for vehicle access con- trol and car park or toll road management are common applications. Magnetic stripe, as exempli- fied by the ubiquitous credit card, or as seen on the back of British Rail tickets, is the poor cousin of the technology. Usage nevertheless continues to grow, not least because it is cheap. According to Omron Europe, the market leader in manmpti sitripe reandr/encder products, shipments will con- tinue to increase in 1991 despite the interest of the banking sector in smart card technology. To cope with this shift, manufacturers offer hybrid card readers which can cope with both technologies. In the long term, however, Omron expects great things from opti- cal memory cards, given their large memory capacity (cur- rently 2BM). OCR and MICR have been most widely used in the sinan- cial sector for reading and pro- cessing cheques, credit card vouchers and giro payment slips. A change to imaging technology is expected. Here the total image of the docu- ment is captured and then pro- cessed. Image applications require large amounts of stor- age, and prices for a 20 work- station system can range from Â£500,000. Accordingly, suppliers expect a gradual move away from OCR and MLCR. Eastern Europe has provided a whole new market for auto ID technology. It is difficult to market goods in the west with- out bar code technology; the sudden flood of new goods in stores has created an urgent need for anti-theft devices; and there is a strong desire to mod- eraise and improve productiv- ity. These are powerful incen- tives. Are there any negative sac- tors? The main need is for qualified systems integrators to serve the smaler cfustomers. fs the potential sale is for hun- dreds of thousands of ponmds, there is no shortage of able and willing integrators, but the same is not true for smaller ystem Customers also need informed advice from suppil- enm who an too aften comse- trate O one technalogy The nt remt, however, is that in spite or the recsion, the SEiognO auto ID Industir coi s to prouper. an I Em d- noMd mwhich wimd tat I ow s N d *. aISl AWBrpe fitams e t ass IDuu wmo am JD xmrAw 71 imOM a\"hsosea MLnlms - a4= gonm imwuemvimft Â·u ~a vagrub weHÂ·I ~ woma ww; * - -",

One of the pioneers in the field is Mike Beigel, a partner in Avid, a Californian company which specialises in injectable tags for animals. As an elec- tronics engineer, he was approached in the late 1970s for a way to identify horses to pre- vent them being switched at race meetings or for insurance swindles. Mr Beigel devised a low fre- quency \"passive transponder\" which could be implanted in animals with a syringe. It has no battery, but a coil which becomes energised and emits a unique code when placed near a special scanner. The coil is wrapped in a form of glass which is non-biode- gradable and causes no side effects. It would require sur- gery to remove it, but this should never be necessary, since the tag has no battery which needs replacement. The company is now expand- ing into Europe, and has recently launched a system in the UK to identify lost pets. Another project under devel- opment will mark laboratory animals to prevent them hav- ing to be tattooed, as they are at present. The potential range of appli- cations is enormous. The advantage of RS is that there is no need for physical contact between the scanner and the tag, which allows them to be used in a wide range of envi- ronments, and with greater speed than if the scanner and t\"-.ihad to be placed next to 7iElather. Texas Instruments has become so convinced by the significance of RS technology that it has established an autonomous group within the ... And security tags on retail goods to prevent shoplifting company with its own board of directors and 150 staff, Texas Instruments Registration and Identification System (TIRIS). Mr Noel Middleton, market- ing manager, says: \"We origi- nally developed the device for pig identification, but quickly realised the ramifications were far larger.\" TIRIS is pursuing five major market segments: * Aircraft baggage and freight: for reconciliation and identifi- cation of goods to ensure they are directed to the right air- craft; * Tyre management: to reduce the risk of theft and extend the life of tyres by identifying those which can be retreaded; * Work tracking: to monitor items during manufacturing, helping inventory control and production processes; * Security: access control for personal and vehicles to restricted areas, and asset tracking to monitor office equipment to prevent theft; * Animal identification. \"It's such a diverse market,\" says Mr Middleton. \"We're investing heavily in the TIRIS programme, and plan to be the leading low frequency supplier within the next five years.\" Other companies have speci- alised in high frequency RS identification, which uses the same principle but with low power microwaves. It has the advantage of a using a beam which can be more accurately directed, and is operable over longer distances than lower frequency equivalents. One of the most topical examples is the new traffic toll- ing system at the Dartford River Crossing east of London, a contract recently won by Saab Combitech and due to be operating by the end of the year. Rather than requiring driv- ers to queue and pay a toll to an attendant when they approach the tunnel and bridge complex, the design uses ... Indicators to keep track of workers in remote and dangerous areas ... antennae which detect an RS tag attached to each vehicle. The tag gives the number of an account opened by each driver, which is debited accord- ingly. If the account is empty, or no tag is detected, a red light comes on and the vehicle is videotaped. The antennae have a range of about 5 metres, and have been carefully positioned to avoid the risk of picking up a signal from the tag on the car in front of or behind the one being scanned. The micro- waves can penetrate dirt, mois- ture, glass and plastic easily to detect the tag, even when it is angled at 45 degreesa the source. The cost it system is approximately Â£2m. Andrew Pickford, area man- ager for Saab Combitech, says the company's alliance with the French company CSEE, a well respected manufacturer of coin machines, helped it to offer an integrated tolling package which won the con- tract. Some commentators have raised ethical objections to computers holding information on exactly who is using the crossing and when. Pickford says the system could be con- figured to keep each driver account anonymous, but Trafalgar House, the ultimate operator, decided against this strategy. Over the next few years, Mr Beigel says, there is great scope for technological advancement in RS systems. \"Bidirectional\" tags, which can be reprogrammed or \"written to\" as well as read, will become more common. He says RS transmission and code systems will generally begin to be standardised in the mass market for the tags, but that some will remain propri- etary to preserve security in certain applications.",

   "text_content" : "ONE of the industries to benefit most from the use of automatic identification tech- nology has been the airline business. From airline ticket- ing to baggage handling to in-flight duty-free sales, coding and scanning have become an integral part of making air travel possible. A wide-ranging airline tick- eting scheme began last year with the introduction on a trial basis of the Advanced Ticket- ing and Boarding pass (ATB), with a pilot scheme by Swiss- air at Basle airport, and simi- lar trials operated by Lust- hansa, British Airways, Air France and others. ATB is a combined ticket and boarding pass with data stored on a magnetic stripe which can be read or printed out. It is designed to eventu- ally replace the separate flight coupons and boarding passes now used. When the ticket is issued, details of the passenger's name, flight number and seat class are entered on the mag- netic stripe. ATB has continued to win converts throughout Europe, In June last year, for example, Atech won a SKr250m contract from Scandinavian Airlines System for a new ATB ticket ATB, now on trial Is designed eventually to replace separate flight coupons and boarding passes system, which covers ticketing, printing, check-in and auto matic gate direction. But ticketing is not the only area to benefit from auto IE technology. It is also being used to improve luggage han dling. In June, news broke of the development of a new system by the British Technology Group called Brals (baggage reconciliation and location sys- tem), a company funded by BTG and Syntech Information Technology. It is designed to combat an ever-increasing problem for modern air travel- lers - the delays and security risks caused when someone's luggage boards a plane and the owner does not. The system is aimed at quickly isolating the baggage of any passenger who fails to board a flight. The fear of sabo- tage is a fact of modern life, and the search for such bag- gage can often cause an aero- plane craft to miss its allotted take-off slot and thus be delayed for many hours. Brals is also used to combat the age-old problem of lost lug- gage. It operates by issuing a barcoded ticket for each piece of luggage checked in at the airport. The system takes a note of each code and numer- als assigned to each bag, and stores that with the name and seat number of the passenger who has checked it in. Through the use of bar code scanning, the location of each piece of baggage can thus be accurately traced as it moved towards the plane - while pas- senger movements are tracked through both the aforemen- tioned airline ticketing system and the airport's internal secu- rity. In addition, a number of major airlines are starting to use automatic identification systems in their on-board retail operations for duty-free sales. Virgin Atlantic, for example, uses the Psion Organiser range of handheld computers - com- bined with bar code readers - to manage in-flight duty free sales. This provides the airline with immediate figures on duty free sales, makes stock- taking easy and eliminating paperwork. Finally, auto i) technology may eventually play a part in the growing \"mobile office\" market - whether it is on a plane, boat or in a car - as salespeople use it to scan in details of stock and inventory information as they makes sales. Taken to mean many things A prototype 'mobile office' fits under a car armrest and Incorpo- rates computer, telephone and fax in the past few years, most experts these days seem to agree that the portable office boils down to a combination of portable telephone, fax machine, battery-operated com- puter, perhaps bar code reader, computer printer and com- -uter modem. With these components, it is easy to conduct a great deal of business - even from the back of a moving car. In fact, Ford is so convinced of this that it has already developed a prototype \"mobile office\" system which pulls out from the armrest of one of its executive cars. The computer and cellular phone provide the heart of any such system. The portable fax machine can either be a bat- tery-operated version of a tra- ditional fax (except operating over cellular rather than land lines), or be a \"fax card\" which is added into the computer itself. The latter offers some advan- tages in that one does not require a computer printer in order to send and receive faxes. Incoming faxes are dis- played on-screen while out-go- ing faxes are composed on the computer and then sent directly from the computer to the receiving fax machine.",

   "text_content" : "WAREHOUSE staff at Panasonic Distribution in Bracknell do not have happy memories of 1969. They found themselves often working sev- en-day weeks, sometimes on 17- hour shifts; some even started sleeping on site. The problem was a move to new premises, combining five separate traditional block- stacking warehouses in Slough into one high-bay store at Bracknell in May 1989. The original paper-based stock control system Panasonic adopted simply was not up to the task of controlling the movement of 800 pallets a day in a busy warehouse measur- ing 100,000 sq ft. Every time a forklift truck driver put away a pallet load, he had to fill in by hand a check digit form which was returned to the office to ensure the correct location had been used. Often, however, forms were not replaced, or were returned only hours later. Finding a wrongly-placed pallet hours after the event was all but impossible. Stock discrepancies reached nearly 50 per cent, despatch of orders was slow, and all too often they were wrong when they arrived: In desperation, PDL called in software house Systems Solu- tions of Fleet in Hampshire, to produce a new stock control package. The resulting system, chris- tened St Peter as before its arrival Panasonic employees \"went through hell\", trans- formed the operation of the warehouse. The Â£100,000 system, which came'on line in January 1990, uses the concept of dissemi- nated computing. At its heart is an IBM 3370 mainframe computer, which holds information common to all departments. Distribution data are downloaded every night to St Peter. The clerk selects containers arriving on the day and creates an \"envelope\" for each con- tainer, including stacking I plans, bar-coded labels for goods to be stored at Bracknell, i and labels for pallets to be sent Sto other depots. The labels help check accu- 1 racy of receipts. If 355 boxes are due, for example, with 35 boxes to fill a pallet, the sys- 1 tem produces 10 labels (one for each 35 boxes) and one label, for five cartons. Provided the Sstacking plan is adhered to, staff need count only the part S.pallet. Highly efficient stacking plans are generated by a sepa- rate software package, Pallet- I manager, developed by Gower i Optimal Algorithms, using the I dimensions of cartons, the rele- i vant pallet type and the space available. Incoming stock is delivered to a pick and despatch station, i where labels are read by laser I guns and instructions dis- played on a screen on a radio data terminal in each forklift truck. The forklift driver deposits the pallet in the allotted space, enters the information into his terminal, and the system checks the accuracy of the delivery. Any error is spotted immedi- ately, and no further instruc- tions are given until the errdr is corrected. Goods leave the Bracknell warehouse on a weekly cycle. When an order is placed - often up to six months ahead - it is not printed by the com- puter, but held in the memory as a prototype invoice. Two days before delivery, details of the order are down- loaded from the IBM to the St Peter system. Picking instructions are sent . directly to the radio terminals on the forklift trucks, eliminat- ing the need for 500 picking lists and 6,000 visual control cards. Once each task has been completed by the driver, an electronic visual control card is immediately updated. This electronic stock card, unlike a manually maintained one, is 100 per cent accurate at all times. Once the outgoing load has been assembled, the driver enters the items and quantities into a hand-held terminal, and the system confirms the accu- racy, or bleeps and prints out a discrepancy report if there is an error. The system has also revolu- tionised stocktaking. Previ- ously, stock was checked each morning by counting all prod- ucts moved the previous day. Now the warehouse figure is automatically maintained by St Peter, as drivers \"report\" the balance which remains whenever goods are put in or taken out. Management has greater awareness of what is happen- ing in the warehouse at all times. The system indicates which trucks are operating, the number of breaks - official or unofficial - taken by each driver, and the proportion of the day's work accomplished by each driver. Incentive prizes are awarded to those with the highest pick rates. \"We're delighted with the system,\" says Mr Paul Step- hens, outgoing planning con- troller at PDL. \"Productivity has increased by 50 per cent, we don't need temporary staff any more, and we've regained total control over stock.\" The system still has the potential for even greater effi- ciency. Future plans include elimi- nating paper completely by creating electronic \"goods-in\" envelopes, moving the printing of delivery notes to the point of delivery, and installing hand- held terminals with bar code readers in each delivery truck.",

   "text_content" : "IF THERE is a single trend which has typified technologi- cal development of the auto- matic identification industry over the past 10 years, it is the movement of systems away from check-out counters. While automatic identification systems at supermarkets are a big part of the $8bn world mar- ket, miniaturisation, flexibility and innovation have moved systems into commercial, industrial and heavy goods environments. The development of a range of bar code, CCD and wand scanners for use with handheld computers, for example, has revolutionised the way many firms conduct their stock con- trol operations. Rather than having to check warehouse stock through a central bar code reading system as it enters and leaves the property, employees can now clip a por- table scanner and computer to their belt buckles and scan each box or palette as it is being loaded. As these devices are getting smaller, they are also getting more rugged - able to s vt t Whhest moststr esful of aapplications. Consider these new products from Cheshire-based Datacap, a company that develops prod- ucts for use with handheld computers: MA battery-operated printer which uses thermal printing technology to produce high-speed, high-resolution print suitable for bar coding. It is also designed to be able to withstand up to a metre drop on to concrete mA \"radio pen\" designed to provide bar code reading capa- bility in environments where space restrictions or other adverse conditions prohibit the use of conventional, wired bar code readers. Similar in appearance to a ballpoint pen, the slim, lightweight transmit- ter reads data like a bar code reader, and then transmits it to a receiver unit plugged into the top of a handheld com- puter. By using radio links to trans- mit the data, the pen can be up to 7 metres away from the data capture device or portable com- puter to which it is transmit- ting data. It operates for up to 10 hours, and switches off auto- matically when not in use. The trend to such devices can be seen in the kinds of options handheld computer and data capture device manu- facturers feel compelled to offer with their systems. British handheld computer maker Psion, for example, recently launched the new HC range. This has built in as standard a RS232 and parallel printer interface, and will optionally have a \"quad-stan- dard\" internal modem for com- inicikation over the telephone line. There is also a bar code scanner module (offering sup- port for wand, CCD and laser scanners) that includes decod- ing algorithms for all common bar codes, and a magnetic card reader for reading 'striped\" magnetic cards such as bank or credit cards. Psion's moves are particu- larly interesting given the hun- dreds of thousands of Organ- iser II handheld units the company has sold as retail products - and whose users began to demand auto ID sea- tures to use with them. According to marketing director Peter Norman, the Psion Organiser, as the name suggests, was initially devel- oped as a flexible \"personal organiser\". Almost by acci- dent, Psion found there was a commercial and industrial market for the systems. Corpo- rates such as Marks & Spencer and NatWest bank started tak- ing on the machines - Nat- West as part of their customer service operations and M&S for their price-checking, and, sub- sequently, for checking credit card validity. This has now become such an important market for Psion that three months ago it announced the HC range - Psion's first handheld machine dedicated to the commercial, public sector and industrial markets. Keith Gallagher, managing director of handheld comput- ing pioneer Husky, agrees about the business opportuni- ties offered by combining new auto ID technologies with han- dheld computers as part of an emerging demand for \"field- based\" computing. \"We can replace pen and paper data collection systems for measurements, bearings and manufacturing systems,\" he says. \"We extend the reach of the field-based system. We are involved in local government PC and host-based systems, where handhelds are natural extensions of software devel- oped for managing local authorities, parks and conduct- ing rent collection.\" In those kinds of applica- tions, the types of data entry will vary tremendously - from basic keying in of data via key- board (something which does not fall strictly under the head- ing of automatic identification) to magnetic card reading and bar code recognition. It is clear, however, that even traditionally labour-inten- sive government agencies such as local authorities are having to look at these technologies to solve their labour force prob- lems. In the future, systems used in auto ID are likely to get smaller, faster and will be able to operate for longer periods using less power. This is par- ticularly true for portable equipment - which appears to be where much of the growth in the market is at the moment. In conjunction with this, handheld computer systems are developing commensu- rately in such a way that they will be able to allow users to receive data at faster rates, store much more data and be able to manipulate and retrieve it more quickly. Using radio pens, CCD scan- ners and laser \"wands\", busi- nesses will be able to use auto- matic identification technology in almost any circumstance to record the purchase or stock movement of any kind of man- ufactured product. Finally, as this technology converges with cellular and PCN mobile telephone systems, data captured in the field using mobile automatic identification systems will then be able to be stored at a company or organi- sation's headquarters almost from the moment it is recorded.",

   "text_content" : "SOMETHING special is about to happen to Daisy the cow. Before long, she may find her- self wandering into a comput- er-controlled feeding station, where she will be automati- cally identified by a portable data capture device which reads a tiny radio tag under her skin. A predetermined amount of feed will be released, she will be weighed, and her future die- tary needs assessed. This is just one example of the way automatic identifica- tion could spread to all aspects of daily life, thanks to increas- ing miniaturisation and porta- bility. 'The scope of applications for portable data capture is limited only by the imagination of the user' \"The scope of applications for portable data capture,\" says Mark Marriott, chair of the Automatic Identification Man- ufacturers' Association com- mittee on portable data collec- tion, \"is limited only by the imagination of the user.\" In the past, data capture devices tended to be fixed, but the last few years have seen the development of portable devices containing both scan- ner and memory/processing facilities. Until recently, most people's idea of such machines was, in the words of Mr Marriott, of \"brick-shaped devices with a keyboard and screen\". New technology and the increasing trend towards automatic data capture have brought a move away from that traditional shape to more convenient, ergonomically designed devices. Data capture devices incor- porating bar code readers are now available in a range of sizes. The smallest, little larger than a fat pen and easily car- ried in a shirt pocket, is a sim- ple device with a bar-code read- ing tip, display and a very limited memory. Next up is a gun-shaped bar code scanner, traditionally connected via a cable to a central host com- puter, but now increasingly found with on-board battery . and memory. More advanced are inte- grated one-handed units with memory, display, a keyboard for secondary data entry, and a built in wand reading tip. The most sophisticated devices have a built-in laser scanner, and a gun-type handle. The operator points the device at the bar code, presses the trig- ger, and the information will be displayed. Leading manufacturers of portable data capture devices include US companies Symbol Technologies, Telxon, and Intermec, UK-based Psion, Infos in Italy and Hoeft und Wessel in Germany. Significant advances have also been made in the last few years in communications between portable devices and host systems. Traditionally there was a need for physical contact between them, often in the form of a cable. But recently manufacturers have increasingly used cradles or slots into which hand-held devices can be dropped, with an optical contactless link allowing data transfer to be carried out quickly and conve- niently. However, data capture devices are not only used in site-based systems, but can be used in the field. Telephone communication technology is well established, and some hand-held data capture devices have built-in modems. Perhaps the most important advance in data transfer, how- ever, has been the development of radio frequency data com- munications. The next few years are likely to see the arrival of separate networks for communication of data by radio, alongside exist- ing cellular voice radio net- works. In the US, the Ardis net- work, a joint venture between IBM and Motorola, was launched in April last year. This is a nationwide wireless data communication service which enables workers using computers or data capture devices outside the office to gain access to central com- puter systems without using a phone, via a combination of existing IBM and Motorola transmitters. Sears, Roebuck and Company, New York Life Insurance, and Otis elevators are all testing the system. Similar networks are expec- ted to appear in Europe very soon, allowing a move away from telephone links to real- time communications using radio frequencies. Such systems open up many possibilities. A technician in the field, for example, could receive instant and detailed information via a portable ter- minal on jobs to be done and calls to be made. As particular spare parts were used from the stock in the van, a bar code reader would register and transmit the fact back to base. On return, replacements for the parts would be waiting for the technician at the ware- house - perhaps themselves quickly located using auto ID - with no need for extensive paperwork. The trend towards RS com- munication in field-based operations is likely to be mir- rored on site. Already, narrow- band radio communications are being used in warehouses, retail organisations and facto- ries to to transmit information from data capture devices to a central host computer. Future years may see the rapid growth in the use of spread-spectrum RS data com- munications, where informa- tion is transmitted across a broad range of frequencies. This has recently gained popu- larity in the US, since it does not require the licensing of the radio frequency within each site - unlike narrow-band, it does not cause interference problems. It also allows large numbers of devices to commu- nicate with one another at high speed. Spread-spectrum communi- cations are expected to be approved across Europe on wave-bands not used for any other purpose - so-called \"gar- bage frequencies\". This could allow the development of fully integrated wireless systems, with workstation terminals, Spread-spectrum communications are expected to be approved on wave- bands not used for any other purpose portable PCs and data capture devices all communicating via radio waves, with no need for cables. A final area of development is Radio Frequency identifica- tion (RS), where data capture devices pick up information by radio from tiny tags. The advantage of this is that no clear line of sight is needed between the data capture device and the tag. These can be put on badges, or collars and used for security purposes to permit or deny access through automatically- locking doors, for example. They can also be injected under the skin of animals - or humans - for identifying any- thing from animals on farms, in zoos or in the wild, to sol- diers on the battlefield. At present, however, RS is relatively costly. Tags cost $5 to $25 - not too bad for small- scale use, but prohibitive where thousands or millions of items are involved. There is also as yet no industry stan- dard system for RS, so radio tags tend to lose out to the humble bar code.",

   "text_content" : ";- 1 5 S a B e 3 i f 1 a B a 5 v 1 ? f 1 i 1 SOME potential users of automatic identification tech- nology are put off by seeing no simple way to use it, or to incorporate it.into their exist- ing computer systems. Auto ID is not an end in itself, and there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as an auto ID system. Auto ID is a subsystem, on which a larger one - such as a stock control or conveyor control system - depends. Most auto ID subsys- tems can operate as a part of almost any larger system. The skill is getting all the different components, which may include different types of bar code scanners or other data capture devices and dis- plays, network controllers, PCs and a mainframe, to work together to carry out the tasks required. For potential users who are looking for ways to harness the power of auto ID, a growing number of so-called \"systems integrators\" exist who are able to offer advice, and link equip- ment together. \"The future of this industry is systems integration,\" says Brian Marcel, managing direc- tor of BCS Bar Code Systems, Kingston-upon-Thames, one company that offers this kind of service. Customers in the auto ID market are increasingly looking for two things, he says. Firstly, they want a \"one-stop shop\", where they can get a complete package of hardware, which may be from more than one manufacturer, and custom- ised software. Secondly, they want systems and software tailor-made for their requirements. 1 \"Peple don't like to be told, iere's this package we do, and here is how you might use it. \"Instead we say, 'let's write some software based on what you are doing',\" says Mr Mar- cel. BCS and other specialists in auto ID systems integration, Including companies such as Alpha-Numeric Systems of Bourne End, BPCC Numeric Arts in Maidenhead, and Sym- lex of High Wycombe, try to meet both these needs. While It is possible to buy the components from separate sources and link them, surveys have shown a high level of dissatisfaction They liaise with the cus- tomer to discuss requirements, suggest different options, and design complete systems Including hardware and cus- tomised software. This can cover every stage from designing appropriate bar code symbiologies and labels, to providing after-sales mainte- nance and training. Using such systems integra- tors also saves time, as they are able to recommend appro- priate hardware, thus avoiding the need for customers to approach a number of different manufacturers. A \"front-end\" data capture system can be added to almost any kind of data processing system, the systems integra tors say. Often the easiest way is to run the auto ID network through a PC, which reports back to a mainframe host com- puter. Getting a system designed by someone with expertise is the best way to ensure it does precisely what it is designed to do. While it is possible to buy the compornents from separate sources and link them together, surveys in the US have shown a high level of dis- satisfaction with the results among companies which have chosen this route, compared with customers who used systems integrators. Most integrators have a range of core systems and libraries of software which can be adapted to meet customers' specific needs. Where this is unsatisfactory, a whole system might be designed from scratch. \"The trend is towards providing solutions, not just boxes,\" says Marcel. Most of the systems integra- tors grew out of other compa- nies. Bar Code Systems, BPCC Numeric Arts, and Alpha-Nu- meric Systems, for example, all specialise in bar code products, supplying high-quality films masters - the original artwork from which a bar code is printed - or bar code printing equipment. All have seen the systems integration side of their busi- ness expand significantly in the last four years, and expect it to become still more impor- tant in the 1990s. A sign of the increasing importance of systems integra- tors in the world of auto ID is that they have been asked to exhibit next year at Scan-Tech, the industry trade fair, which has traditionally concentrated on hardware sales. \"We think there will be a significant upturn in the neces- sity for this kind of work,\" says Gordon Smith, sales direc- tor of BPCC Numeric Arts. The retail trade, he says, led the way in introducing auto ID systems when the technology was new and little understood, and has now become a very mature market. New custom- ers are showing interest, are more knowledgeable and demanding than their prede- cessors. Hardware manufacturers may start their own systems integration services, although most do not have the resources at present and are content to use systems integrators as out- lets for their products. Some of the software houses, however, are already moving into systems integration. Some of the leading com- puter manufacturers already provide systems integration services. Gary Lowrey, market- ing manager of the systems integration division at ICL, says the company can design The use of Industry standard operating systems allows programming In standard languages, making auto ID easier to introduce and use systems incorporating auto ID on an individual project basis to meet customers' specific needs, using products from other manufacturers where necessary. The whole process of systems integration is becom- ing easier thanks to the move among auto ID manufacturers towards industry standard open systems. Previously, manufacturers tended to develop devices with their own proprietory program- ming techniques and operating systems. Now, data capture devices such as bar code and magnetic strip readers have started to use industry stan- dard operating systems such as Dos, that used in most PCs. The use of industry standard operating systems allows pro- gramming in standard lan- guages, making auto ID easier to introduce and use - and also to re-sell. It avoids purchasers becoming locked into a rela- tionship with one particular maufacturer. On the most practical level improvements in data commu- nications, and especially the likely growth in spread-spec- trum radio frequency commu- nication, mean that the age of fully-integrated systems is not far away. Using RS communication, any number of data capture devices, PCs, and workstation terminals could be linked to a central host system with no need for cables. Such integrated systems would offer great flexibility. Companies wishing to change the lay-out in office or factory floors could do so easily with- out having to rip out miles of. wiring.",

   "text_content" : "The real skills of big-company leadership 1OONER oor later when reading ^booiks on management, the S^Jobds column is almost always reminded of moving home to the country at seven years old. My expectations of the move were high, thanks to the picture books I had been given as a town child. They depicted rural boys and girls as living the life of Reilly junior. In particular, far from being confined to a backyard, they freely roamed a world full of jolly fanners delighted to let children play with their lambs and calves and such. What happened when I actually tried it is still too painful to describe. But I suspect it was much like the shock of taking up the real-life work of management after previously just reading about same. For instance, most articles as well as books on the topic portray the job of managing as consisting essentially of decision-making. They give the impression that once a sufficiently senior executive has carefully reasoned out what to do, it is as good as done. But that clashes with the things high-rank managers have told me when I have talked to them off-the- record over the late night oil, as opposed to interviewing them for the FT. To judge by their words, making decisions is an enjoyable doddle compared with getting their outfit to take some concerted action tnlerably resembling what the boss Intended. Which raises the question why experienced executives bother to read standard-type writings on management. And the only answer I can think of lies in a claim made by one of the few books that depart nom the general rule, namely Boss published in 1958, which I mentioned a fortnight ago. The claim is that typical bosses are primarily driven by an urge to impose their will on other folk. Hence it may be that they read standard management books rather as older children read adventure tales and romances, to fantasise about themselves as they would ideally like to be. If so, and they feel up to having a dose of realism thrown in, they may care to try another exceptional book to be published in paperback next week. Called The Organisation of Hypocrisy*, it is the work of Professor Nils Brunsson of the Stockholm School of Economics who bases his observations on *John Wiley. Â£17.95 practical consulting work he has dlone, mainly although far from entirely in Swedish publlc-sector His good news for texecutives - or at least those hdig and colplex companies - i that it is ight and proper for them to devote themselves to decision-making. What may seem bad news to some, however, is that they ihould not exuect anything they decide to be -ut'into force. The thinkin behind his advice starts fom the premise that large complicated organisations can no longer guarantee their long-terr survival merely by efficiently preducing goods and services. The main reason is that, despite the roling back of direct government intervention, a big group's future importantly depends on the approval of external concerns which, although knowing little or nothing about its business, have certain standards of their own to which they expect it to conform. For example, no company can be world-class at more than a limited range of things, which fast changing technology and markets are apt to lene uncompetitive for lengthy periods bBefe the comnpan can turn to sucessl alternatives in the interim, it may have to satisfy inancial indtitutions that it is a candidate for support. But financiers are far frm the only outsiders whose approval can be decisive. The others include numerous if not devious pressure- roups such as environmentait and, east of the Atlantic, the ever ramifying European Community. Moreover, as some of the external bodies' concerns conflict with each other let alone with efficient production, meeting the demands of the whole lot of them may be cccordingly, a great deal of high-level political activity is required on the part of large companies' leaders to keep such influential outsiders persuaded that their interests are at least being seriously regarded The trouble is that if the top managers are to be good enough at the politics, they are unlikely to be able to maintain a detailed under- standing of the processes, produc and markets by which their company earns its income. And we an know what happens to bosses who try to control complex thing of which they have only upef knowledge: it is called the \"Yes Minister\" phnmwenon. They, end up being controlled by supposed subordinates who possess the close understanding they lack, rubber- stamping the consensus decisolans put up to them, if only for fear of the technical mayhem liable to ensue if they don't. But even if the leaders have the wise humility to concentrate on burnishing the political appearance of the company, and leave its actual operations to those who thorougly understand them, they still have a dilemma. Unless they are seen to be properly in charge by the outside world, they'll lack the credibility needed to influence the important external interests. So what can company chiefs do? Luckily, Nils Brunsson offers pointers. They rest, he says, on four principles: distance, morality, responsibility, and reform. Distance is best enshrined by repeated declarations that the topmost management concerns itself solely with strategic Issues andl laying down broad gidelines, without getting involved in day- to-day operations. Such publicly blishd distance has great for dealing with outside ,bodis. For example, although they 'wll still expect the leadership to take decisions in line with their concerns, theyll accept that what's decided will be slow to take effect. What's more, being typically busy bodies, in the interim they will probably forget they ever wanted it. But the corollary of being able to take such politically convenient decisions without hampering the company's efficiency, is that the chiefs really have to be aloof from day-to-day operations. Certainly they may walk around chatting to subordinates, but they must not become involved in what they are doing, and still less in determining their rewards or punishments. The morality principle dictates that the goals set by the leadership should be on the highest ethical level Professor Brunsson illustrates the practical benefits by pointing out that a top management which ordains that 85 per cent of products must a quality test, will set y planng that the target can't be achieved with- out moreresources. If the goal is that all products must be perfect, staff will often find ways to do better than 85 per cent costlessly. IResponsibility requires that, while the company's operational results are outside its leaders' control, they must be as willing to be blamed as to be praised for them. So resignations may some- times be needed, albeit preferably with the scapegoat's real innocence being recognised by a suitably golden handshake. The final principle, reform, dictates that chiefs must always look beyond the present to the future, and continually institute reforms visibly intended to improve their company. Even so, such top- down changes should be confined to aspects of its public appearance - its organisation chart, for instance - without being allowed to disturb actual working practices. The reason, the professor says, is that besides being read as a good omen by outsiders, the idea that improvements are in the offing can be highly motivating to employees. But they tend to have the opposite effect if ever they start happening. Michael Dixon",

   "text_content" : "COVENT OARDEN The lyric theatre is a place of miracles: the second part of the Royal Opera's newest Ring cycle proved the point in ever more elating fashion. Who would have thought, after all the disappoint- ments of the opening Rheigold, that on Monday a gust of life-bringing fresh air could be made to blow through the dank enclosures of Gdtz Friedrich's \"time tunnel\" production? The achievement was worked through the score, and through the alert, un-routined leading perfor- mances. The evening was dominated by Bernard Haitink, back on electrifying form after that uncomfortable Vorspiel; indeed, this was one the conductor's triumphant evenings in the opera house, for by a combination of energy, imagination, expertise and sheer artis- tic honesty he transmuted even the most unpromising elements in the dra- matic unfolding into Wagnerian gold. Each conductor of London's Rings in recent decades has left his personal imprint on its sound-world. Haitink's is marked by instrumental muscle. There, is no spare fat on the body of strings, the wind and brass bite into as well as bolstering the climaxes, an athlete's well-balanced leanness characterises the attack - yet not a choice of tempo or sound-colour strikes the ear as either driven or forced. The fitness (in all senses) of the conductor's musical imagination means that, whether in passages of lyrical outpouring (elo- quently geared to the particular voices on display) or brooding darkness, the creation and sustaining of momentum and atmosphere seem to be a single, unified executive operation. Since 1989, when Haitink conducted his first Covent Garden WalkUre, he has learned to stretch out the spans of each act with both expansiveness and taut- ness ever greater. This rendered the performance wonderfully exciting - the mighty sweep of the opera took me by the throat anew - and unforcedly deep and serious as well. One day, per- haps, we shall encounter this Walkare reading in a production worthy of it; meanwhile, it comes as a blessed confir- mation of the transformatory powers of Wagner's music. Poul Elming is the new Siegmund, the most naturally vigorous, musical, and apt-voiced the house has had for many a long season. The Danish tenor was a baritone for some years before embarking on the upward metamorpho- sis; the virtues of full-grained baritonal warmth have been preserved in the tone, but a bright, un-clogged tenorial focus (with only a slight lack of ring at the very t4p) has been drawn out thereof. All of this makes his a Siegmund instrument dhilaratingly and eutii fully suited to the music. In addition, Mr Elming 16 tall, personable, intell-' gent, and continually interesting on stage: he finds both the outsider's rough integrity and the lover's rapt. ardour in the part, and since the voice can subscribe'to both aspects of the interpretation without strain, the singer's handsqme looks and physical resilience are pure bonus. The love of the Volsung twins has always been a Ring relationship delved into by Friedrich with deep sympathy and understanding; so it was again on Monday, for the partnership of Mr Elm- ing with the Sieglinde (also new here) of Karan Armstrong was filled with dis- nity and tenderness. Miss Armstrong, Covent Garden's well-remembered 1981 Lulu, sings the music less securely, less steadily than we (and, no doubt, she) want her to; but her musical instincts are noble, and her presence is never less than honestly affecting. The others are the 1989 principals: John Tomlinson a black-voiced (but now wildly overacted) Hunding; Help Dernesch the most mature and eloquent of Frickas; James Morris vocally at his most magnificent as the Walkiar Wotan (the cut and thrust of argument, the black depths of despair may escape him, but the sonorous richness -.and musicianly shaping of his Farewell are currently unmatched); and Gwyneth Jones as Brilnnhilde,,more uneven than ever but pulling off some typically gen erous passages at the -last. With Haitink on this form, it seemed, in even the vocally less impeccable moments, an evening of bel canto Wagner. Max Loppert In addition to the two complete Ring cycles there are a couple of extra perfor mances of Dos Rheingold, the produc- lion fresh to London this autumn. At the first of them on Saturday a new Wotan took the stage and immediately seized both the role and the whole opera by the throat. John Tomlinson is the resident Wotan at Bayreuth at the moment. In the opinion of many the English bass 'baritone is the outstanding performer in the present cycle there, but this was the first opportunity that we have had to see him as Wotan in this country. The liveliness of his timbre is well Poul Elming: a most impressive Siegmund known here and the only weakness revealed by this particular role occurs at some top notes, when the voice loses quality on certain vowel sounds. As a whole portrayal, it came across with tremendous panache. Every word tells and Tomlinson strides the stage a voracious Wotan, hungry for power and yet constantly gnawed at from the inside by the realisation of his own weaknesses. It was a performance that asked for positive support from the pit and Edward Downes, in his sole appear- ance as conductor of this Ring, gave the singer all the dramatic thrust he could have wanted. Incidentally, a long queue for returns stretched down the road on Saturday and yet there were rows of empty seats inside. If that is a result of the Royal Opera's pricing policy, it is not a happy one. Richard Fairman",

   "text_content" : "DOMINION THEATRE If there is proof of an afterlife, it lies in Keita Asari's magnificent production of this early '70s musical, in which Christ meets kabuki at a halfway house between Euro-rock and tradi- tional Japanese theatre. The show has been in the repertory of Tokyo's Shiki Theatrical Com- pany since 1973 in two incarnations, of which this stunning kabuki version is the earlier. Musically, it remains remarkably faithful to Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's original, bustling through the ballads and pouring forth the choruses; indulging the sentiment of the score only to provide immediate dramatic con- trast with the muscle of the ensemble singing. Visually, it is a spine-tingling mixture of hip- pie exuberance and Eastern asceticism: white-faced figures hurl themselves around the stage as an Afro-haired Judas advances down a ramp of upturned wagons, forming disarmingly into a go-go dance as Jesus makes his entrance - a head of sleek black hair taller than anyone else on the stage. Yuichiro Yamaguchi's physical stature is heightened by the stunning lighting to a lumi- nous reserve. While the rest of the company thrash around in puddles of yellow light, Jesus glows glacially white. A moment of irreverance brought the Red Indian chief of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to mind as he weighs into the moneylenders, fights to keep his head above a tide of supplicating hands, or looks on in serenely as he is swayed on the shoulders of the mob in time with their hearty \"Hosanna\". Of course, the trouble with this approach is that it denies Christ the common humanity that gives depth to the torment of his disciples and. betrayers. Mary Magdalen (played by a woman, against the all-male kabuki tradition) is light- weight, while Jun Sawaki's Judas disappears to Yuichiro Yamaguchi his death over the ramp of wagons as if suc- cumbing to a bad acid trip. But it is a pleasure to see a director capable of creating such grandeur from such apparent sim- plicity. Asari's control of the stage is total; the singing is superb. The most thrilling moments come when he manages a union of East and West: moments such as the witty rendition of \"Herod's Song\" by a transvestite in garish kimono whirling a stave like a drum majorette; or the crucifixion itself, in which the cross is hoisted behind a three lattices of staves held by leering grotesques, while a ripple of organ music whisks us gently back to Christianity.

   "text_content" : "\"Swiftly the years, beyond recall./ Solemn the still news of this spring morning.\" The lines are originally Chinese, not Jap- anese, but they catch the dual sense of time that gives Noh Theatre some of its. haunting strangeness. A story's action will proceed slowly, slowly; an emotional passage will stop the action altogether, and then a brief act, occurring at some- thing like real-life speed, will seem shockingly fast. Clement Crisp reviewed the first programme in Saturday's paper. Programme Two had the same basic structure: a serious two-act drama; then a quicker, shorter comic tale; and finally a more poetic final drama. I found this final work the most beautifully eloquent of either programme. In this case it was Shokun, the story of two old villagers whose daughter has been sent to the king of the northern barbar- ians as a peace-offering. Very affecting is the scene in which the parents quietly relate their grief to a neigh- bour. We have nothing to take in but their stillness, their mel- ancholy voices, the beautifully designed robes and wigs, and their masks, from which time has washed all emotion leaving nothing but age and character. Only the king has any speed. He charges on, jumps and lands bang! seated on the floor. He is all violence, and is in drastic contrast not only to the parents but to their daughter Shokun - who, stationary cen- tre-stage beneath a weeping willow, her mask an unlined visage of white-faced beauty, is an emblem of purity. Most alien to the occidental is the opening two-acter, Frjito, which is the longest item, stylistically less concen- trated and visually more sparse. But the more you attend to Nob, the more char- acter it reveals. Fujito tells the story of a new ruler who is confronted with an old woman who accuses him of killing her inno- cent son. He denies; but then confesses; and offers up prayers for the dead man's spirit. The ghost appears, recounts his death but relates that the prayers have appeased him and brought salvation. There are many piercing moments here, none more tell- ing than the gesture for the old woman (masked) in which, seated, she raises a hand in sorrow towards her cheeks. The fingers, as always in Noh, are not parted. The dynamic is muted; the hand does not reach her face; but, amid so much stillness, this slight movement comes like an invol- untary tear falling down a face. We see the sorrow that haunts her life. Here, as so often in Noh, emotion has been dis- tilled and preserved in amber. Alastair Macaulav I",

   "text_content" : "When yOU find yourself a year away from the 20th aaniver- sery of your first Prix Italia you tend to ask why yon keep returning to suach an event. Ther are personal pleasures: while film critics have to keep traipsing back to the expen, eive horrors of Canne, tole- sion critics are treated to a different town each year by the Italians, who are dab hands at festivals. This year the Prix Italla is in the quiet seaside town of Pesaro. In the evenings there are splendid concerts in cloisters or formal gardens, and a concentration of British broadcasting person- nel the like of which you rarely find in Britain, all eager to discuss television. But those are incidental attractions. The real reasons for returning are, first, to find out what the rest of the world considers to be its best televi- sion. Second, to see how Brit- ish programmes compare. And third, to see whether there are any international trends. Some years ago this column reported from the Prix Italla on a sud- den passion for programmes about the causes and horrors of the Second World War, occurring, it seemed, because of the arrival of the first gen- eration of television depart- ment heads who could remem- ber nothing about that war. And this year? This year it seems clear that, all over the world, feminism is having a powerful effect upon television programmes, both fictional and non-fictional. Of course the feminist cause has been creeping into programmes for nearly 25 years, but this is not a question of programmes about feminism. Maybe it is like the business with the Sec- ond World War; you have to wait a generation before you begin to understand the full effect of phenomena which turn out to change our world. Whatever the reason, we are now seeing programmes which appear to assume not only that women have been exploited, marginalised, and pretty well ignored over the centuries, but that women can do no wrong because... well, because they are women. And by extension, all that is wrong with the world must stem from men because... well, because they are not women. The first drama to be shown this year was a long Danish production called Cecilia. It was set among the 19th cen- tury smallholders of Jutland - people, it seemed, much like Shetlanders, earning a tough living from sheep farming and knitting. It was beautifully made, recalling Britain's own Bread And Blood, with the same sort of authenticity in the rough clothes and crude housing. The story is of Mik- kel, a physically vast and locally important sheep famer and middle-man in the stock-Ã½ ing trade, who has a beautiful daughter: the eponymous She falls in love with a poor local youth, Elben, but rik- kel, a dominant husband and heavy father, prevents the match. Worse, he promises Cecilla to the second richest (and middle-aged) man in the area, and has the banns read. Cecilia goes ouat of her mind, the wedding is cancelled, and when a newly prosperous Esben returns from his trav- els, Mikkel ensures that he sleeps with Cecilia, hoping this may bring her back to sanity. But Cecilia, who believes she is dead and in paradise, kills Esben that he may join her there. End of deeply depressing story. Everything bad within it, from pride to jealousy, from the subjugation of the wife to the tethering of Cedlla like a goat, comes directly from Mik- 'All over the world television is telling similar stories: men bad; women good' kel's overbearing masculine values. Much the same was true of the next drama, from the other side of the world: Brazil's The Canagaceiro's Revenge. A bandit, released from prison, returns to a vil- lage where he has been humili- ated, to take revenge. While he waits for sundown the cow- ardly men of the village send him a beautiful 17-year-old virgin from the orphanage, reckoning that the bandit, who hasn't seen a woman for 10 years, will be so distracted that he will have his way with her and forget about revenge. Actually the bandit and the girl fall in love and clip clop into the sunset, but the only person who emerges with any credit is the placky, beautiful, innocent, self-sacrificing orphan girl. Admittedly there is a moment when the bandit goes all limp and silly because the orphan reads poetry to him; if you thought North American television drama was sentimental just wait till you see what the South Americans can do. But the point is that the male charac- ters emerge as uniformly macho or wimpish. Here once again there is no such thing as a redeeming male characteris- tic, let alone an admirable man. At least the first British entry in the drama category was an outstanding piece of work, ITV's A Murder Of Qual- ity with a magnificent cast (Dnholm Elliott, Jos Ack- and Billie Whitelaw, David Threlfall and more) and a com- pact script by John Ie Cand fom his own novel. Morsoever this seemingly conventional thriller has serious things to say about the English class structure. Yet here, again, the villain is of course a man, the victim is, of course, a woman, and one more set of masculine values (public school homosex- ual) is pilloried. Imagine any- body on television daring to mock lesbianism! Another British production, Proust - 102 Boulevard Hauss- man, written by Alan Bennett, staring Alan Bates and Janet McTeer (magnificent) and entered ironically by France because La Sept were co-pro. dncers, was more subtle. Even here, however, Proust is seen as domineering and egotistical while his housekeeper, Celeste, is angelically selfless and understanding. Nor is the pattern confined to drama. The most extreme example so far has been a French documentary, La Cica- trice in which a woman serv- ing a long prison sentence is interviewed by another woman in a tone of \"Oh you poor, poor, thing\" and urged to tell the \"real\" story of why she murdered her husband. She cannot be sure, but she reckons her father may have committed incest with her while she was unconscious, and her husband certainly made love to her after she had taken Valium. She is sure because he left traces of sperm on her - a fact which she declares \"disgusting\", though she is not sure why. She also claims that being made to look at the photographs of her hus- band's dead body was \"so debasing, so horrible\". These are the words of a woman who gunned down her husband with a rifle, and has told us how much she enjoyed being a prostitute. The programme still conveys the clear notion that she is the victim. You get the picture. If the Prix Italia viewing rooms give an accurate impression then, all over the world television is telling similar stories: men bad, women good. A Martian visitor judging humankind from these programmes would never dream that our race could produce males such as Jesus Christ or Albert Schweitzer nor women such as Lucreida Borgia or Myra Hin- dley. Surely Shakespeare's view of the world with Goneril and Began as well as Cordelia, Kent as well as Edgar, is nearer to reality as we all know it than the bizarre one-sided picture which televi- sion is now delivering in the second age of feminism.

   "text_content" : "The blue but sobering piano of Billie Holiday's old accompanist Mal Waldron made for a gloomy night's entertainment at Camden's Jazz Caf6 earlier this week. The tremendous background chatter which usually prevails here didn't help matters. Playing in trio with unfamiliar drums (Brian Abrahams) and bass (Arnie Somogyi) hired for the night, made for some uncertainty too, but 65-year-old pianist/ composer Waldron seemed distant all the same: no introductions, no hellos, no goodbyes. Chain-smoking the while, he had made a hesitant start, prodding at the keyboard in a disinterested way, and rarely looking up to his accompanists. Thus it took a couple of numbers for him to work out his message. But a considered improvisation eventually emerged from a Morse code interpretation of standards. Waldron is often compared to Monk and Powell, but his sound is more sober than these two. On this night he worked up his themes slowly, gradually gathering momentum, giving Abrahams and Somogyi little room for soloing and keeping the dynamics even. On this showing it is easy to S H 1 1 I hear why he has made a name in film and stage scores. But so removed from his audience did he sound I felt, for once, that this jazz might have been better heard in a concert hall. Only towards the end of his first set did sufficient positive energy find its way into the playing to turn some heads away from talk of the day in the office. Abrahams, an excellent drummer and leader in his own right, was even given leave to solo briefly. But it was a shortlived glow: a glance at his wristwatch and, glum-faced, Waldron was gone.

   "text_content" : "PROCRASTINATION is all too often the first and last resort of the Middle Eastern politician faced with a difficult decision, but neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis have anything to gain by further delay. Octo- ber, the month chosen by the US and the Soviet Union for a Middle East peace conference, is only a week away. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has already made seven visits to the region since the Gulf war and is considering an eighth. He is chafing to issue the invitations and embark on the much more serious busi- ness of forging a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis. The Israeli government has already given its answer to Mr Baker; it will attend the confer- ence, but only if the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Arab residents of east Jeru- salem are not represented. Now it is the turn of the Pales- tinians to reply. Broadly, Mr Baker and his moderate Arab allies have suggested that the Palestinians take part in a joint delegation with Jordan and choose representatives who fulfil the Israeli criteria - without abandoning their polit- ical demands or their right in principle to choose whomso- ever they want. Demeaning acceptance Israel evidently has no right to vet the delegates of its nego- tiating partners, and it is demeaning for the PLO to have to write itself out of a formal role in the peace conference. But the Palestinians should agree to go anyway rather than abandon another chance for peace. They should accept for two reasons. First, the argu- ment over representation is largely procedural; all the likely Palestinian delegates support the PLO anyway and none would give up the Arab claim to east Jerusalem. Sec- ond, the Palestinians have lit- tle choice; Israel would be more than happy to go ahead without them, particularly if the prize was a peace treaty with Syria. There is a glimmer of encouragement for Mr Baker from Algiers, where the Pales- tine National Council (the par- liament-in-exile) is meeting this week. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and his associ- ates seem to have grasped the need to co-operate with the US administration following the disastrous PLO support for Iraq during the Gulf war and the start of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Even Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO \"foreign minister\", who has long been suspicious of US motives in the Middle East, has recognised that the PLO must make painful compromises and do its best to promote the peace conference. Firm line That sort of Palestinian flexi- bility can be attributed partly to the firm line that the US administration has been taking against Israeli settlements in the occupied territories in the last few weeks. President Bush and Mr Baker want to delay the granting of US guarantees for $10bn in loans to finance Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel, and they want to ensure that American money is not used to build Israeli houses on Arab land. Mr Bush should not yield to the right-wing Israeli government on the issue of set- tlements, because to do so would be to betray both the Palestinians - from whom he is requesting compromises on the peace conference - and the principles of international law and order on which he fought the Gulf war against Iraq. UN resolutions require Israel, in exchange for peace with its Arab neighbours, to withdraw from occupied terri- tory won during the 1967 war. The increasing prominence of the UN in the aftermath of the Cold War makes President Bush's call this week for the General Assembly to repeal its resolution equating Zionism with racism all the more timely. Britain and others believe that to try and fail to overturn the resolution by the necessary two-thirds majority of votes would be worse than doing nothing, but Mr Bush obviously believes that enough African and eastern European UN members have changed their minds to make repeal a probability. It is not just that the resolution is offensive and ineffective; for the past 16 years it has provided Israel with a valid excuse for reject- ing the UN as an intermediary and upholder of justice in the Middle East. The time for excuses has surely run out.",

   "text_content" : "THE normally mild-mannered Cardinal Hume, archbishop of Westminster, came out fight- ing yesterday. His fists flailed at the Conservative govern- ment's policy of encouraging schools to opt out of local authority control. This took some courage. The Roman Catholic archbishop was speaking only five days after Dr George Carey, the Anglican archbishop of Canter- bury, brought Conservative wrath down upon his own head following a speech with a not dissimilar theme. Dr Carey was castigated for a throwaway line linking the vandalism in Newcastle to social deprivation, but that was not his subject. Education was. He was the victim of a puffed-up flurry of political indignation at a time when election fever was running high. What both churchmen have been speaking about is the essence of church responsibil- ity. They deplore the notion that the purpose of education is merely to prepare children for careers, although they acknowledge the value of that. Their concern is for the whole individual; they naturally, and rightly, want the inculcation of spiritual values to be regarded as a basic aim of teaching. This principle is enshrined in the 1988 Education Act; the two clerics want to see it put into practice. It therefore seems reasonable for them to cast doubt on the weight given to training or vocational education, or to challenge the widespread view that schools be judged by their examination results alone. That is their job. Cardinal Hume expressed concern for the fate of children in less pop- ular schools, when the current political and therefore fiscal bias favours popular, opted-out schools. He quoted the Catholic principle of \"subsidiarity\" when arguing for a role for local education authorities and against centralising control over schools. This is, perhaps unfortu- nately for him, in tune with Labour policy. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative edu- cation secretary, was obliged to disagree with the arch- bishop yesterday. Good. The Anglican Church was the pri- mary progenitor of mass edu- cation in England. If it and its Catholic parent did not speak out we would be the poorer for their silence - especially when, as in this case, they hap- pen to be right.",

   "text_content" : "THE IDEA behind the poll tax was that every adult should contribute to local government spending. Not everyone has to pay the full amount - rebates are available for those on low incomes, as with the rates. But apart from a few exceptions, everyone has to pay a mini- mum contribution of 20 per cent of their local poll tax. This includes people on income sup- port, and their benefits were increased by 20 per cent of the average poll tax to provide the wherewithal. The result was predictable. The additional benefit often finds better uses in households already strapped for cash - particularly when the local poll tax is higher than the national average. (A saimilar leakage has been noted when social secu- rity benefits include money meant for mortgage payments.) Councils are forced to clog the couts to pursue people who have no earnings to attach no sav to asquester and few assets to sebe. Those who have pd their poBll tax fulminate at I the extra they have to pay to cover the non-payers. The Audit Commission esti- mates that collecting the 20 per cent minimum costs Â£6 a head more than it brings in. The case for abolition is clear, as the government has conceded by restoring 100 per cent rebates for the new council tax. Abolition commands as much support from the Tory shires as it does from the Labour cities and towns But the Treasury refuses to sanc- tion abolition for the final year of the poll tax without the politically unacceptable quid pro quo of clawing back the extra benefit Chasing people who can't pay rather than won't pay is costly and adiversion of scarce time and resources hx the much more important task of making Mr Heseltine's aew councl tax wor. The govern- ment should ind some way of getting rid of this needles db- traction if its plans fr local government are not to be blow off Poru.a",

   "text_content" : "the Iormrer Comecon Suilding, Mr Grigory Yavilsky: gestures down at the toy cars moving up Kalinin Prospect, and the sight of Muscovites trudging about the streets. \"I put it like this. I told the representatives of the republics - if you jump from this height, I guarantee you will end up as a mess. If you stay in the room, I can't guarantee you happiness, but you have a chance. So it is with an eco- nomic agreement. If you don't sign it, you will have one terri- ble ness. If you sign it, I can't tell you it will be paradise.\" Mr Yavlinsky, giving an interview in a break between negotiations with representa- tives of the republics and meet- ing President Mikhail Gorba- chev, looks exhausted, his normal ebullience cramped by tiredness. It is Mr Yavlinsky who largely bears the burden of seeking to construct, from the ruins of the Soviet Union after the August 19 putsch, something which might still be called a union - though proba- bly not Soviet, and certainly not socialist. (\"Call it what you like - union, community, as some want, or a table or a chair or a shoe. It doesn't mat- ter, so long as it works.\") Mr Yavlinsky has, in formal terms at least, achieved the position which he has long needed to put his pro-market ideas into action. As co-author of the \"500-Day Programme\" of one year ago, he saw it buried by the then Ryzhkov govern- ment and by a Soviet president who had initially supported it; as co-author of the \"Window of Opportunity\" programme for foreign-assisted reform, drafted with American scholars, he saw it watered down by the same president, who could not get the then Pavlov govern- ment to back it. Now, Mr Yav- linsky is near the top of the union government, and the conservatives have been routed. Now is his - and the country's - moment of truth: is economic reform still a pos- sibility? As a deputy chairman of the four-strong leadership of the Committee for the Manage- ment of the National Economy - the body which carries on what there is of Soviet govern- ment - he has initiated talks with ministers and other repre- sentatives of the 15 former Soviet republics on what they will agree to by way of a com- mon economic framework. Yesterday, he claimed some success. He has refined his 15- page draft agreement into five main headings - a banking system, a financial system, taxes, customs, and prices - and has reached agreement on the first two. If instituted, this would commit the participant republics to a banking union on the lines of the US Federal Reserve - \"a completely inde- pendent, professional body, not something run by representa- tives of the republics\" - under which there would be a single approach to monetary and credit policy; to the printing of money; to interest rates set by the republics' central banks; to the disposition of gold and cur- rency reserves; and to the reserve requirements and rules for commercial banks. That, he said, was hard work. But there is more to come which will be as hard for the independent-minded repub- lics to swallow. They must agree to limits on their bud- Yavlinsky: will be lucky if his plan succeeds gets; to finance the Soviet debt jointly ; to print their own money only if it is tied to the rouble and does not operate within the framework of sepa rate financial systems; to pre serve common labour and social standards; to end exist ing customs barriers; and to move rapidly to free-market prices. Mr Yavlinsky's programme is tough, and will require tough policing if it is to mean something. At the core of his effort is a belief that there still exists an opportunity to co-or dinate a move by all participat ing republics to the market economy; and that if they do not agree to co-operate, they will retreat into a variety of different autarchies, with embattled leaderships holding on to state property which has simply been renamed \"Ukrainian\" or \"Armenian\" where before it was \"All-Union\". \"This is actually one of the hardest things - the question of property. I say to them [the representatives], do you want to get the property for your selves or do you want to pass it to your citizens? Where do you want it to go? And they say to me: 'Why are you talking to us like this? We are independent rpublics.' I say, because this is the central question, someone must put it.\" Not surprisingly, Mr Yavlin sky is widely seen as the last defender (with Mr Gorbachev) of the union. Even his friends among Moscow's radical econo- mists regard him as an almost tragic figure, tied to a great idea whose time has gone; the failed coup, they argue, destroyed not only the conser- vatives, but the union too. Mr Yavlinsky's answer is that there is, indeed, no union. \"In the negotiations, I say again and again, the republics are not negotiating with the centre. Certainly, I am not the centre. They are actually nego- tiating with themselves. It is they who will form the union, if there is to be one; and the content of it is a common deci- sion to co-operate.\" But, as he confesses, he is dealing with ministers and offi- cials who, though they may accept his analysis, are them- selves under conflicting pres- sures. Of the 15 teams of repre- sentatives, three - from the now-independent states of the Baltics - are either observers or, in the case of Latvia, nego- tiators who cannot hope to sign an agreement because of their domestic political reali- ties. The Ukraine, the largest republic after Russia, is also \"neither saying yes, nor saying no; they are determined to make what should be a short story into a long one\". Many of the republics, with Ukraine in the lead, met in the Estonian capital of Tallinn at the weekend to sign non-bind- ing interstate agreements on trade, monetary policy, com- munications and transport - a .move seen explicitly as an alternative to Mr avilinsky's efforts. It is a measure of the chaotic and opaque quality of present Soviet politics that ministers from these same republics, indeed, sometimes the same ministers, have also agreed with Mr Yavlinsky on essential elements in his programme. Even Russia, which has been the most enthusiastic for a union, is increasingly swayed by politicians and economists who argue that it is now too late to again use the wealth from Russia's raw materials to subsidise a union - of any kind. On Monday, the Russian cab- inet met in emergency session to accuse its acting prime min- ister, Mr Ivan Silayev, of little short of treachery. Mr Silayev, wearing his other hat as chair- man of the Committee for the Management of the National economy, had proposed that decrees taking union property and resources into Russian ownership be rescinded - decrees which he himself had helped draft only a few weeks before. Mr Silayev, not surprisingly, appears to be on his way out. He has resigned as Russian prime minister (though he has agreed to continue for the next month until a replacement is found) and may not, it seems, become chairman of the inter- republican economic commit- tee, which will take over all- union affairs once an agree- ment is signed. Mr Yavlinsky said yesterday that Mr Silayev's position was\"not clear\". Asked if he would take the job as chair- man, he said: \"I would do so if I agreed with the agreement reached, and most importantly, if the governments of the republics which were part of the agreement supported my appointment. I must have that support, not just of the leaders. Because if I am instituting a policy which makes many peo- ple unemployed in Moldava, I have to say that I am doing so with the support of the Mol- dovan government.\" Mr Yavlinsky is under pres- sure from the Soviet president to get the agreement through before the scheduled meeting of the Union Supreme Soviet on October 8. The new presi- dential spokesman, Mr Andrei Grachev, said yesterday that Mr Gorbachev hoped the repre- sentatives and Mr Yavlinsky would have agreed the draft in principle, so that it could then go to the republican parlia- ments and presidents. It could fail at any of a num- ber of stages; or it may end up as only an agreement between Russia and the Central Asian states - though then, Russia would be expected to be a milk- cow to these desperately poor republics. The consensus among lead- ing economists attending a conference in Moscow on Mon- day was that the agreement would be signed, but that none of the republics would, or could, live up to its terms; that nationalism had gone too far, and that its logic ran against all that Mr Yavlinksy was seeking to achieve. This is his third, and most wearying, attempt to take his ideas from the paper into prac- tice. But he will be very lucky indeed if he can, by force of argument, push it through.",

Dankert's claim to the unofficial title of Mr Europe may be sealed by his draft of a final treaty on European political union. It controversially gives sweeping powers to the European parliament, thus downgrading the importance of individual members' parliaments. Dankert, 57, has a long association with EC affairs; indeed he is better known in European than Dutch politics. He served as a Euro MP between 1977 and 1989, and was the European assembly's president from 1962 to 1984. In the 1970s, while sitting as a Labour Party member in the Dutch parliament and also a Euro MP, he found time to be a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, the assembly of the Western European Union. Labour's return to power in 1989, in coalition with the Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, allowed Dankert to put his European experience to good use at the foreign ministry, where his post is equivalent to that of ajunior minister in the UK. Other Euro credntials incldude five languages and marriage to a Frenchwoman.

   "text_content" : "John Plender on the ownership of pension scheme surpluses I ho owns the huge surpluses that have been piling up in Britain's pension funds over the past decade? The question, which has been raised repeat- edly in the courts of late, now confronts the Occupational Pensions Board (OPB) in par- ticularly stark form as its adjudication committee today considers Lucas Industries' plans to claw back Â£90m from the surplus in its pension fund. The implications run far beyond the immediate con- cerns of the motor components and aerospace group. The Lucas application to modify the trust deed is not only one of the earliest full submissions to the government-appointed pensions watchdog under newly amended regulations covering the treatment of sur- pluses; it has also been chal- lenged by a former trustee of the fund on the most funda- mental grounds. The outcome could thus have implications for the valuation the stock market places on the pension fund surpluses of other compa- nies, as well as the relative rights of employers and pen- sion fund beneficiaries. Broadly speaking, the OPB is prepared to sanction the clawback of surpluses where the move is accompanied by an improvement in benefits, the trustees are independently advised and the package Is agreed by the employees. In the case of Lucas there is no question that benefits are being significantly improved. Agreement was also reached between the company, the unions and employees on the the pension fund consultative committee, after what a com- pany spokesman yesterday described as \"a meticulous process\" of consultation. But the OPB also has to be satisfied that the company has a respectable claim to a share of the surplus in the sense that it was committed, in the period when the surplus was accumulating, to meeting the balance of the cost of pension liabilities after the employees had contributed a fixed per- centage of pay into the fund. Enter Mr Simon O'Leary, a for- mer trustee of the Lucas staff pension fund of 14 years' standing, and now a Lucas pensioner, alleging a breach of trust. The OPB has received a let- ter from Mr O'Leary in which he states that the former Lucas chairman, the late Sir Bernard Scott, who also chaired the staff pension trustee board, warned the trustees that the company would not be prepared to finance any shortfall that might occur in the fund; and that in the event of a shortfall some solution other than extra money from the company would have to be found. The same assertion was also repeated by another director, who was also a trustee, several years later, according to the letter. As far as Mr O'Leary is con- cerned, that suggests that the Lucas pension fund, far from being a \"balance of cost\" scheme in any meaningful sense, was no more than a repository for the deferred pay of the employees. And in purely practical terms that is certainly how it has looked since Lucas ceased to contrib- ute to the fund in 1985, while employees have continued to pay up. Mr O'Leary also feels that the surplus should be used to raise benefits towards the ceil- ings permitted by the Inland Revenue. And he argues that it is imprudent for the fund to give away Â£150m (before Â£60m of tax) for a promise from the employer which he believes could prove worthless at a time when the money might anyway be needed to comply with the European Court of Justice decision in Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange on equalising male and female retirement ages. The OPB thus confronts a difficult decision. Mr O'Leary, meantime, has drawn atten- tion to the reality that some- times exists behind seemingly benevolent pension fund pater- nalism. For while today's Lucas management claims to take a different view, there is not much doubt that many large companies regard the pension fund as little more than an investment trust sub- sidiary. While some have been prepared to make good short- falls with lump sum payments into the fund, such payments have often been motivated pri- marily by a desire to shelter profits from tax in a gross fund. The value of corporate guar- antees of solvency can also be questioned. Mr Bryn Davies, a consulting actuary working mainly for trade unions, argues that in practice the promise does not provide the absolute guarantee it is some- times made out to be. This is because most employers have a power under the trust deed to cease contributing to the scheme. The Inland Revenue, meantime, has exacerbated the problem of surpluses by limit- ing tax relief where assets exceed liabilities by a mere 5 per cent - an absurdly nar- row margin when actuaries are valuing over periods of up to 40 years. The OPB now has a range of options short of outright approval of the Lucas propos- als, some of which - calling for more information, seeking help from the courts - would involve delay. But it could ask the company and trustees to reconsider the whole package if it believes Mr O'Leary has a point. One way or another, the case will run and run - not least because Mr O'Leary is determined to seek a remedy in the courts if the OPB gives its fiat to the deal.",

Sir, Those who have read the Monopolies Commission report on London Underground must share my surprise at its being used to support demands of the company's managers for ever larger increases in investment in this system (\"Warning of closures on London Tube\", September 16). Though it con- cluded that deficiencies in ser- vices were the result of under- investment, much of the report's evidence contradicts this judgment. The report describes how the company is developing a new investment and renewals strat- egy, and recommended that it should have obtained the nec- essary information and devel- oped the relevant techniques by the end of 1993. Until London Underground has reached this stage it is dif- ficult to see how its managers can be confident that they know the long-term needs of the underground system for investment. Its estimates can- not be taken very seriously and their impact is weakened by other evidence in the Monopolies' Commission report, which showed that the reliability of Underground ser- vices was not related to the age of equipment used, and that maintenance was not con- ducted efficiently. This evi- dence suggests there is plenty of scope for improving services by using its existing staff and equipment more effectively.

Sir, I was most intrigued to read your article (\"Technology - rich treats in the sugar bowl\", September 12) about the launch by Tate & Lyle of its new artificial sweetener - sucralose. You mentioned various other sweeteners, and the fact that they all have drawbacks, mainly that they have an after- taste of one kind or another. Personally, I find that they all taste fairly revolting! I am sure sucralose will not be an excep- tion, and that it will therefore not represent an enormous threat to world sales of sugar. However, you left out any mention of the only sweetener that tastes like sugar and has no aftertaste - cyclamate. Cyclamate was banned in 1970 on the results of totally false evidence, which has been found on repetition to have been incorrectly obtained, and the EC has reinstated it as an allowed substance. Despite the fact that the evi- dence against it was totally discredited, and therefore it can now be used in soft drinks, I can see no evidence that it is being used, or sold as a sugar substitute. This seems rather strange; however, could it be connected with the fact that all the exper iments to try to prove that it was a dangerous substance seemed to be financed by sugar companies, and they have a vested interest in keeping it off the shelves?

Substantial expenditures on ambitious road-building programmes alone will not bring about an improvement in what is now a policy disaster area. Only a more strategic and balanced view of transport pol- icy will improve matters, and even then only over the medium to long term. Government policy shows a pronounced bias in favour of the road system which should be corrected through a fairer approach to pricing and invest- ment planning. Syptoms: Even atÂ£15bn the programme for trunk roads will fall short of meeting fore- cast demand.

Urban form changes only slowly and thus profound stresses are set up between our urban environ- ment and transport behaviour. Transport policy has failed to respond adequately to these complexities. Government solutions to transport problems give too much weight to specif- ically transport criteria. For example, 80 per cent of the eco- nomic benefIts justifying the road programme comprises the estimated value of the time savings of road users. Little weight is attached to \"exter- nal\" economic and environ- mental efctfi which are cru- cial in the long ran.

Much cur- rent practice is based on sophisticated but narrow tech- niques of forecasting traffic and of calculating time-aving benefits. While further research is required, much can be done in the meantime. We suggest that: Strategic transport planning should relate the overall shape of the transport network to development opportunities over (say) a 20-year period.

Within the above framework, priorities for public support should be judged on the basis of the contribution towards strategic goals (such as urban regeneration or regional devel- opment). Private funding based upon the income streams from road pricing, tolls and fares could form an increasing component for road as well as rall. If road and rail are on a \"level playing feld\" in respect of pricing and conditions for subsidy, much of the heat could be taken out of the related question of privatisa- tion of British Rail (and other public transport operators).

   "text_content" : "From Mr Peter Ashby. Sir, Your report of the corre- spondence between Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Michael Howard, the employment sec- retary, concerning further cut- sin Department of Employment programmes makes dismal reading (\"Treasury seeks to cut Â£lbn from training\", Septem- ber 24). Further cuts in the budget for employment training really would spell disaster for ET in much of the UK. However, what is remarkable is not so much the Treasury's instinct to cut and keep cutting - that seems all too predictable - but rather the Employment Depart- ment's forecast (not reported in your story) that less than three in every 10 people leav- ing ET in 1992-9 will find jobs. The Treasury is surely right to say that it will not finance training if the vast majority of trainees remains unemployed after completing training. Yet it appears to ignore the fact that some Training and Enter- prise Councils (Tecs) are already planning to introduce credits into ET precisely in order to relate the numbers of \"awards\" for training more closely to success rates from different courses - and unemployed people's own plans for finding employment directly related to their training. Mr Mellor is also critical of career development Loans. Here, again, it is the Depart- ment of Employment that seems to be behind the times. Some Tecs would prefer to introduce their own local credit schemes for adults in work, linked to \"pay-as-you- learn\". What they need, however, is additional public funding for the counselling and guidance services on which a system of adult credits must be based. It appears that, yet again, Tecs risk losing out due to a lack of strategic thinking at the top. If this is so, it is Mr Howard, rather than Mr Mel- lor, who should carry the can.

Sir, I hope that the recent changes proposed by Rover (\"Rover follows Japanese route\", September 18) will not be seen solely as a carbon-copy of Japanese methods. The package includes a single com- pany council, single status, the abolition of clocking, and a simplified grading structure. These steps have already been introduced in some companies, and are long overdue in many more. There is, of course, the quid pro quo of greater flexibil- ity and continuous improve- ment, both of which will require discussion and mutual understanding. But with \"social partnership\" as the theme of the recent TUC Con- gress, the package deserves to be judged on its intrinsic mer- its, and not immediately critic- ised as an \"alien approach\".

   "text_content" : "From Mr William F Low. Sir, All patriotic Scots will not have missed the irony of the warning by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor (\"Mackay warns of Scottish isolation\", September 19), to Scots that any alteration to the constitutional status quo between Scotland and the rest of the UK would lead to \"isola- tion or semi-isolation\". Lord Mackay made his remarks in the town of Arbroath where in 1320 the Declaration of Arbroath established the case for Scottish sovereignty in the following words: \"For so long as 100 men remain alive, we shall never under any condi- tions submit to the domination of the English. It is not for glory or riches or honours that we fight, but only for liberty, which no good man will con- sent to lose but with his life.\" As for Lord Mackay's claim that the union of Scotland and England was \"probably the fin- est example of two nations coming freely together to the mutual benefits of their peo- ples\", he may be a good lawyer but he certainly is no histo- rian. Even a cursory examina- tion of the circumstances sur- rounding the Union of 1701 will reveal that not only was it resented by the people of Scot- land, but also they were never consulted. In fact, the union was implemented only by brib- orv and intimidation by the English authorities. As for mutual benefits aris- ing from the union, Lord Mackay is undeniably correct on one instance, viz himself, a Scot who occupies the highest- English legal office. Most of his fellow Scots are still waiting for the benefits to materialise. William F Low, 5 Kirklee Terace. Glasgow G12 OTQ Fax service LETTERS may be faxed on 071873 s538.

   "text_content" : "New developments augur well for the rejuvenation of an international dinosaur AFFAIRS tion-defying dinosaur, now boasting 50 members, was fast coming to the end of its natu- ral existence and that only periodic roars at South Africa were keeping it going. But as it lumbers towards its next watering hole in Harare, where Commonwealth prime minis- ters gather next month for their two-yearly meeting, there is a small chance that some- thing can be done to breathe new life into the old beast. Not that the Commonwealth itself has altered in any funda- mental way since the last tur- bulent meeting of heads of gov- ernment in Kuala Lumpur in 1989. It continues to be a heter- ogeneous group of nations with little to unite them except his- tory and language and, in most cases, severe problems of eco- nomic under-development. Those problems, many of the Commonwealth's critics feel, could be dealt with more effec- tively by other international organisations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and United Nations agencies, than by an under-funded, post-colonial association including only a few \"rich\" industrial countries. What has changed is the international environment in which the Commonwealth operates and some of the asso- ciation's main actors. Most important have been the rapid political developments in South Africa, notably the de Klerk government's moves to dismantle apartheid legisla- tion, release political prisoners and at least start the process of negotiations with leaders of the black majority. The effect of these changes on the atmosphere in which the Commonwealth prime min- isters will hold their discus- sions should be highly salu- tary. Even countries such as the African frontline states, which continue to be deeply sceptical about the Pretoria government's long-term inten- tions, recognise that a modifi- cation of the policy on sanc- tions, though not yet their complete abolition, is called for. A new British prime minis- Apologists for the Common- wealth have had a hard time over the past decade. Increasingly, it has looked ter should also help. Margaret Thatcher's outspoken opposi- tion to sanctions prevented a consensus fr6m being reached at successive Commonwealth summits. Her replacement should contribute to a more propitious climate in which other, long-neglected issues can be discussed. During his brief period as foreign secretary, Mr John Major was humiliatingly out- flanked at the last summit when Mrs Thatcher decided to publish a dissenting British communique on sanctions, after having previously agreed to a joint document with the other heads of government. That is an experience which the present incumbent of Num- ber 10 Downing Street will not have forgotten and it can confi- dently be assumed that he will not adopt the highly confronta- tional and damaging tactics of his predecessor. Cogent argu- ments can be put forward in support of Mrs Thatcher's anti- Improvements will not be enough to ensure the body's survival unless there is a perception that it has a world role to play sanctions stand. But it was the uncompromising and aggres- sive manner in which they were presented that had such a disruptive impact and lost Britain its traditional leading role in the organisation. Mr Major's task will be facili- tated both by his reputation as a constructive thinker on the developing world's problems - his debt relief proposals at a Commonwealth Finance Minis- ters' meeting last year were highly appreciated - and the more moderate position adopted by the other members on South Africa. Countries such as Canada, previously in the hardline camp, have lately been insisting that the Com- monwealth must adopt an alto- gether more positive policy towards South Africa. There is still plenty of scope for dis- agreement between Britain and the other members on the recommendation for linking a step-by-step dismantling of sanctions to further practical moves towards ending apart- heid. But, in proposing an immediate lifting of at least some sanctions, the proposal is sufficiently flexible to serve as the basis for a compromise. It is in any case clear that, whatever the setbacks to the attempts to start a real politi- cal dialogue in South Africa, the process now has its own inexorable momentum. Sanc- tions, whatever their contribu- tion to the South African gov- ernment's change of heart, have largely become an irrele- vance, and it is high time that the Commonwealth should turn to other matters. Fortunately, the need for a fresh look at the organisation's role is something which its new Nigerian secretary- general, Chief Emeka Any- aoku, has fully taken on board. Less ebullient than his prede- cessor Sir Sonny Ramphal, but more pragmatic and realistic, \"the Chief\" has set out a num- ber of priorities for the Com- monwealth of the future. No doubt, their achievement would not turn the Common wealth into an organisation with anything like the same clout as the European Commu- nity or the UN. But the recom- iiendations have the merit or being both attainable and giv- ing the association an enhanced political and human rights role, which it has long lacked. Double standards have long been one of the Common- wealth's greatest weaknesses. While calling upon South Africa to abolish apartheid and to implement the principle of one man one vote, many member countries were them- selves guilty of abusing both human and democratic rights. The violation of numerous high-minded summit declara- tions on the subject have pres- ented the Commonwealth with a serious credibility problem. Countries such as Singapore, Kenya and Pakistan, to name but a few of the most obvious culprits, have all been guilty of clamping down on freedom of expression, while democracy is still a very delicate plant in many others, if it exists at all. The time has come for the Commonwealth's rule of non- interference in the internal affairs of member states to be applied more flexibly. Proce- dures for the resolution of con- flicts between member coun- tries, the sending of observer missions to monitor elections in countries with little experi- ence of pluralistic political systems and the monitoring of human rights in member coun- tries should be formalised and given an institutional frame- work. As a quid pro quo, the indus- trialised member countries such as the UK, Canada, Aus- tralia and New Zealand would have to be prepared to make a greater aid effort. Democracy, which they are interested in promoting, will only take root in the poorer countries if it is accompanied by jobs and higher living standards. Yet the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, one of the organisation's most valued practical agencies, has a lamentably low 1991-92 budget of only Â£30m, given the great demand for its services. The proposed improvements in the working of the Common- wealth are essential if it is to have a new lease of life. But they will not be sufficient to ensure its long-term survival unless there is a general per- ception that such a loose asso- ciation of nations still has a role to play on the world stage. For some, that role can best be fulfilled in north-south negoti- ations, thanks to its mixed membership of industrialised and developing nations. More- over, the collapse of the super- power system, the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugo- slavia and the search for asso- ciation arrangements between their constituent parts, as well as with the European Commu- nity, has suddenly brought the Commonwealth model back into fashion in some eastern European circles. It does, after all, provide the perfect framework for states who value the historical, lin- guistic and economic ties between them, but who want to be politically independent of each other. Croatia and Slo- venia, please note. There may be a place for you in Harare.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels and Our Foreign Staff A FRENCH soldier was among 30 people reported killed yes- terday in Zaire as mutinous members of President Mobutu Sese Seko's armed forces ram- paged in the capital Kinshasa. France and Belgium, the for- mer colonial power, sent a total of 800 troops to evacuate nationals threatened by the rioting and looting. Some 10,000 Belgians and 6,000 French citizens are resident in the central African country. A Belgian communiqud said the mission was also being co- ordinated with the US. Hundreds of foreign nation- als fled and more than 1,000 people took refuge in the Inter- continental Hotel in Kinshasa. The city's commercial centre was stripped bare after two days of mob rule. Civilians, protesting at food shortages and hyperinflation joined sol- diers angered by a missed pay rise. Homes, shops and a hotel were looted. The national news agency Azap said anti-government pro- testers had ransacked the headquarters of Mr Mobutu's ruling Popular Movement for the Revolution party. In Brussels, the Defence Min- istry said the \"purely humani- tarian\" operation was approved by Mr Mobutu's tot- tering government and it was designed to favour neither the government nor the opposition. Mr Omer N'Kamba, a Brus- sels spokesman for the Zairean opposition Union for Democ- racy and Social Progress, told the Belgian news agency Belga, however, that the presi- dential guard was under orders to sack foreign property in Kinshasa and other cities. Mr N'Kamba said Mr Mobutu \"wants in this way to get the same result as in 1978\", when Belgian and French troops flew in to rescue their citizens from a revolt in the province of Shaba, and indirectly bolstered Mr Mobutu's position. Viscount Davignon, presi- dent of Socidtd Gdndrale de Belgique - Belgium's largest holding company, with exten- sive interests in Zaire - said events in Kinshasa signalled the end of the Mobutu regime. La G6ndrale buys copper for its non-ferrous metals business from Zaire. Viscount Davignon said that \"now that it seems there is nothing behind the facade of power, a push is enough to topple it\". Kinshasa officials said Mr Mobutu, who has ruled for 26 years, would make a televised speech but did not indicate the timing or its content. Belgium's relations with its former colony in the past 18 months have deteriorated severely. In May, a widely leaked cable from the Belgian ambassador in Zaire said \"it is impossible to continue with Mobutu.\" Mr Mobuto has presided over severe economic deterioration and has refused to yield to demands by political oppo- nents to loosen his one-man rule. In recent months he sanc- tioned a national conference to consider a multi-party system, but this was started only in August after repeated govern- ment postponements. It was suspended last Friday.

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins in London, Ronald van der Krol in The Hague, and David Buchan in Brussels MR JOHN MAJOR warned yesterday of \"grave difficul- ties\" facing the European Com- munity in trying to reach a treaty on political union but said the latest Dutch presi- dency plan was still \"a basis for further negotiation\". The Dutch draft proposals outlined in The Hague yester- day would give the European Parliament more legislative power and bring much sensi- tive external and internal secu- rity policy making within the Community remit. Mr Major made clear Britain's deep-seated objections to references to a \"federal\" Europe and other parts of the draft Dutch text on political union as the storm over Euro- pean union within his Conser- Accord unlikely on Dutch political union plan.....Page 2 Observer .....................Page 22 vative party appeared to be reviving. Downing Street officials said there was little improvement from the UK's point of view in the Dutch draft's provisions on social as well as security pol. icy. Presenting the plan, Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch European affairs minister, said he had detected \"certain openings\" on the part of the UK about his government's plan to give more law-making power to the European Parliament. But he predicted that concern would generally focus more on the Dutch draft treaty provisions on external security. Indicating the EC presi- dency's openness to amend- ments, he forecast that the defence debate among the 12 would be powerfully influenced by the outcome of the planned Nato summit in November, a month before the 12 hope to reach final treaty agreement at Maastricht. Mr Dankert did not rule out calling an extra EC summit on political and mone- tary union before Maastricht. The reaction from diplomats in Brussels was mixed, with Germany giving a special wel- come to the proposed increase in law-making powers for MEPs. Britain warned that the odds against success at Maa- stricht had now lengthened. From the middle ground of the debate, Italian diplomats said that while Rome favoured much of the substance of the proposals, it had urged against such radical changes so late in the negotiations. Mr Dankert conceded that the Germans were exercising \"leverage\" by tying their accord to monetary union to a deal on political union. Meanwhile, the row earlier this year between Mrs Mar- garet Thatcher and Mr Edward Heath, former Tory prime min- isters, resurfaced. On BBC radio, he described a speech in Washington by Mrs Thatcher denouncing federalism as \"so remote from reality as to be unbelievable by anyone\".",

   "text_content" : "By Neil Buckley in Tbilisi Rebel national guardsmen back up the opposition occupation of Georgia's national television building in Tbilisi SPORADIC shooting was reported in Tbilisi early today, hours after the republic's presi- dent announced a state of emergency to take effect today in the Georgian capital. In comments raising fears of civil conflict, Mr Zviad Gam- sakhurdia said a \"civilian and military coup\", directed by Moscow, was threatening him and the Georgian parliament. The president said the centre of the city would be \"strictly controlled\". Peaceful demon. strations would be permitted but not \"illegal armed groups\". The overnight shooting was heard around the republic's television centre, an opposition stronghold and one pro-opposi- tion member of the National Guard was injured. Earlier more than 5,000 peo- ple had again demonstrated support for Mr Gamsakhurdia outside the government build. ing. A short distance away, several thousand opposition supporters held a rally outside the city's philharmonic hall. Mr Gamsakhurdia, accused by his opponents of being a dictator, said the so-called opposition was no more than an \"anti-constitutional coup\". The \"junta\", including Mr Tengiz Sigua, former prime minister, Mr Georgi Kitovani, former commander of the National Guard, and Mr Georgi Hoshtaria, former foreign min- ister, had formed an \"illegal bandit military unit\" occupy- ing the television centre and attempting to occupy the gov- ernment building. \"They are supported by Moscow and their every step is directed by Moscow,\" Mr Gam- sakhurdia said. \"Former prime minister Sigua was recently in Moscow for four days where he was being instructed.\" Mr Gamsakhurdia claimed the \"coup\" was supported by only two or three thousand people, including former mem- bers of the \"communist mafia\" who had lost their positions, ill-educated youths and \"crimi- nal elements\". The government would try to avoid bloodshed and arrests, said the president, but his statement was a clear warning that he would not tolerate armed opposition. By yesterday more than 100 rebel members of the National Guard had joined the opposi- tion, based at the television centre. More rebel troops were said to be in a base just outside republic's capital. A similar number of govern- ment soldiers were gathered in the courtyard of the govern- ment building. Negotiations between repre- sentatives of government and opposition ended in deadlock. Soviet aid, Page 86",

   "text_content" : "By A\"ce Rawathom In a quiet suburban street in Pinner, on the outskirts of London, Mr Ron Pollard is ensconced in his conserva- tory ploughing through the six novels which yesterday were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. The Booker is Britain's most prestigious literary award and Mr Pollard is one of Britain's most experienced odds-setters. The Ladbroke director who graduated from horses and grey- hounds to books and poli- tics has read all the books on the Booker shortlist for some years to assess the odds for the chain of bet- ting shops. Mr Pollard is not a literary animal. \"Ron doesn't know much about books, but he knows what he likes,\" said his employer. Mr Pollard also knows his odds. He has picked the Booker win- ner as his initial favourite for the past three years. For Ladbroke the Booker Prize means a few thou- sand pounds in extra bets, but for the publishing industry it is one of the most important events in the literary year - espe- cially when the industry is struggling against the worst conditions many pub- lishers have ever known. The six novels on the short- list - Time's Arrow by U a__.. Al I I'\\ Th%' ' Fanushed Road by Ben Okri (Cape), The Redun- dancy of Courage by Timo- thy Mo (Chatto and Windus), Such a Long Jour- ney by Rohinton Mistry (Saber and Saber), The Van by Roddy Doyle (Seeker & Warburg) and Reading Tur- genev by William Trevor (Viking) - are guaranteed extra sales. The publishers have been planning their 'shortlist strategies' for months. Saber has been doing so since July. It discovered that Rohinton Mistry had made the shortlist Just before four o'clock yester- day afternoon, and instructed Richard Clay, Faber's printers in Suffolk, to print 15,000 extra copies of Such a Long Journey. A similar scene was enacted in the offices of the other shortlisted publishers. The reason for all this activity is, of course, money. Mr Jullan Rivers, marketing director of Dillons, the chain of bookshops owned by the Pentos group, reck- oned a book sells at least five times more copies if it gets on the Booker short- list. Sales of the winning novel will be higher still. As the publishers rush to print extra copies of the shortlisted titles, Mr Pol- lard is racing thro his novels to set his odds in time for Ladbroke to open its book on the Booker tognrow- But William Hill has pipped him at the post. It hsued its Booker eds yesterday lem than an hour after the shortlist came out with Martln Amis as 2-1 avour- ite, followed by Timothy Mo 100-0, Roddy Doyle 4-1, William Trevor 9-2, BnB Okri 11-2 and Rabl- m et Mistry 61.",

The yields on Costain and Mowlem shares of 16 per cent and 13 per cent respectively suggest that not everyone is counting on it. Tarmac, whose profits in the first six months were less than a fifth of their level in 1990, is more difficult to read. The shares, which yield 7.4 per cent on last night's price of 202p. would certainly be expensive if the dividend had to be trimmed. But the betting must be that it will be maintained. Quite apart from the compa- ny's perennial optimism, there is scope for considerable mar- gin improvement in housing next year even if the market remains slack, while US profits should jump sharply even with a modest increase in volume. Having said this, Tarmac's shares are hardly cheap. Group profits even in 1992 are likely to be only a third of their 1989 peak, while the company has a hard struggle ahead to create a more balanced business. The rating will reflect its recent earnings volatility for a while yet. End-year gearing, mean- while, is likely to look reason- ably comfortable at 40 per cent. But this will be seasonally low, and the rights issue rumours should not be laid to rest. Sterling With sterling still bumping along at around DM2.90, it might seem an odd time to revert to the argument that it should move to 2.25 per cent bands within the ERM. But 10 days away from the first anni- versary of sterling's entry into the system, it is worth recall- ing that it has fallen only once below the 2.25 per cent floor, on the toppling of Mrs Thatcher. In that time, the dif- ferential between UK and Ger- man money market rates has moved from 6 percentage points to one percentage point. Sterling has meanwhile moved from DM2.93 to DM2.90. The obvious argument against narrow bands is that of political risk. But despite all the talk of a November elec- tion, sterling has risen appre- ciably in the past month FT-SE Index: 2,676.8 (-2.9) Tarmac Share price relative to the FT-A Buildng Materials Index 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 Sep'86 87 88 89 90 91 Soursa: Dalastream against the dollar and the yen. It is rather the DM which has performed more strongly again, largely because of the reduction of tension after the abortive coup in the Soviet Union. More generally, it could be argued that if foreign exchange traders have shown themselves unwilling to short sterling aggressively over the past year within its 6 per cent band, they may be equally nervous of tak- ing it on within the stricter regime of 2.25 per cent. And while the political risk can never be dismissed, there could be an offsetting advantage: that of being seen to lock the UK into a low inflation rate while there is still time. Michelin The good news in Michelin's interim figures was that it expects to be back to break-even at the pre-tax level by the end of the year. The bad news is that net debt has risen a further 11 per cent to FF31.6bn, admittedly partly as a result of the stronger dollar. Debt of this magnitude - gear- ing is over 260 per cent even before inclusion of FF5.5bn in subordinated debt - is likely ) to be a serious drag on profits, - even as operating recovery i continues. Notwithstanding weak mar- i kets, which also tripped up , Pirelli in the first half, Miche- i lin has pushed through price increases. It is claimed that - these could yield an extra i FF300m this year, but that is i chicken-feed compared with . the debt. Lower stocks may I reduce working capital, but the redundancy programme will be t a continuing drain on cash this f year and next. Capital spend- I ing cannot be held back indefi- - nitely, especially given the threat of powerful competition i if the Pirelli/Continental merger eventually goes ahead. Michelin can scarcely look to internal cash generation to reduce its debt. At some stage it will need a rights issue, and a massive one at that, since net debt is more than twice its market capitalisation. It clearly prefers to wait in the hope that the turnround in operating profits will be increasingly reflected in the share price. A further modest rise is indeed possible on hopes that the price of a large rights issue would be the enfranchise- ment of the quoted B shares. But given the debt overhang, the price is unlikely to recover to the FS300 level last seen in 1987. At FS128, it has already outperformed the French mar- ket by 70 per cent over the past year. Much of the good news must already be discounted. Hays Given that business services have proved much less resis- tant to the downturn than advocates like BET hoped, it has been a considerable achievement for Hays to strug- gle through the recession with its reputation largely intact and its Â£615m market capitalis- ation 50 per cent higher than a year ago. Whether the one per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits justifies the 40 per cent outperformance by Hay's shares since flotation two years ago is another matter. Granted, the specialist nature of Hays' distribution businesses, particularly food and chemicals, contrasts with the lower margin services like office cleaning or towels offered by its rivals. Collapsing profits from its personnel divi- sion were partially offset by a one-third jump in the contribu- tion from commercial operations like archive storage. The series of small acquisi- tions has not helped profits by much, although financing charges have been more than covered. Instead, the increase in profits is largely attribut- able to lower interest charges. The group's ability to generate cash is proven - the Â£15.7m cash inflow more than covered the full-year dividend - but heavy spending on the Â£30m distribution factory for Wai- trose will again be a drain on resources. The problem is that it is hard to be too optimistic about this year, even though profits should rise sharply when the personnel division improves. Assuming a 7 per cent increase in earnings, they are on a pro- spective multiple of 15.2, which would seem to leave little room for improvement.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron In New York SALOMON BROTHERS, the scandal-hit Wall Street securities house, will be taking a \"substan- tial\" charge against third-quar- ter earnings to establish a reserve to cover fines and costs the firm expects to Incur because of its illegal activities in US gov- ernment bond markets. Although Salomon did not reveal the size of the planned charge, Wall Street analysts esti- mated it could ran into hundreds of millions of dollars. The Securities and Exchange Commission, one of the many regulatory agencies investiga- ting Salomon's illegal bids in Treasury auctions, is expected to impose heavy fines on the firm for its misconduct, while more than 20 lawsuits have been filed against Salomon by shareholders and rival securities firms seek- ing damages for losses allegedly incurred because of Salomon's manipulations of the Treasury markets. The decision over how much Salomon should reserve for future fines and costs will be a difficult one. A big charge would reveal that Salomon fears heavy fines from government agencies and large judgments or settle- ments against it in the US courts. This could undermine confi- dence in the company further. After an initial fall, Salomon shares closed up $% at $22/%. Salomon, however, may decide to take a small charge to cover the initial costs related to the scandal, with the intention of adding to the reserve of funds later. Whatever the size, the charge will take a large bite out of its third-quarter results, due out next month. Salomon first admitted to rig- ging bond auctions in August, and the effect on its operations was felt almost immediately, as customers suspended dealings with the firm and the Treasury banned it from bidding for cli- ents in government auctions. Although Salomon earned $451m (Â£259m) in the first half of 1991, full-year profits could be severely hit by the scandal, and are likely to be well down on those reported by its biggest rivals, which have been enjoying one of the best years on record. The scandal has already forced Salomon to shrink its balance sheet. The firm said yesterday that the value of its assets had dropped from this summer's record high of about $150bn to the levels of 1990. At the end of that year, the firm's balance sheet was worth approximately 110Obn. Salomon has been forced to sell off billions of dollars of its assets (mostly held in the form of fixed-Income securities) to reduce borrowing levels because banks have cut their lending to the firm, and investors have been reluctant to let Salomon refinance its commercial paper debt.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent PRE-TAX profits of Tarmac, Britain's biggest building materi- als and construction group, plunged 81 per cent to Â£18.2m (Â£97.8m) during the first six months of this year. Pre-tax prof- its for the whole of last year fell 49 per cent from Â£377m to Â£190.7m. Sir Eric Pountain, chairman, said yesterday the group was sus- fering from the recession in the UK and US construction markets. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder which also has sub- stantial quarrying and contract- ing operations, had to transfer Â£17m from reserves to pay a maintained interim dividend of 3p. Sir Eric said market conditions were harsh and showed no signs of immediate improvement. Recovery was likely to be slow and would come too late to help this year's profits. The group did not expect to increase the Â£20m of provisions against its UK housing operations at the end of last year \"unless there was a further sharp fall in house prices\". There were no plans for a rights issue. Tarmac said it intended to reduce net debt of 630.5m - equivalent to gearing of 56 per cent - by reducing working capital and selling non- core businesses. Gearing would be 40 per cent its convertible capi- tal bonds were not included as debt. During the past 18 months the group's labour force had been cut by 3,000 to 32,000. This, with other savings including mothball- ing of plant, had cut overheads by up to Â£50m a year. The recession had reduced turnover and profits in every division except contracting. Over- all, turnover fell 14 per cent from Â£1.79bn to Â£1.53bn. Tarmac said volume sales and prices declined in many areas. Housebuilding in the UK and building materials in the US were among the worst-affected divi- sions. UK housing profits fell 71 per cent to Â£9.9m while US profits dived 97 per cent from Â£15.1m to Â£500,000. Earnings per share before ordi- nary dividends fell from 8.4p to just 0.7p.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy and Bronwen Maddox MR ROB'ERT MAXWELL, the publisher, yesterday served a writ for libel and malicious fals hood against the BBC over a Pan- orama programme on Monday night which looked at the Max- well business empire. The BBC said it would vigorously defend the writ. Shares in Maxwell Communica- tion Corporation (MCC) fell 6.5p to 163.5p yesterday on turnover of 3.5m shares. Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers, a second listed Maxwell company, fell 5p to 89p. Three members of the BBC staff are also named in the writ. Mr Maxwell, chairman of MCC, plans legal action against a num- Der of newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph, which repeated some of Panorama's allegations. The prograinme dealt with issues such as the importance of intangible assets to MCC, the fairness of a number of Daily Mirror games such as Spot the Ball and factors that influenced the MCC share price last autumn. Mr Maxwell said the pro- gramme was substantially a rehash of old smears which had been disproved. \"I will add only one example to disprove the accusation that the intangibles in Maxwell Communi- cation Corporation's 1990 balance sheet were overstated. Pergamon Press represented just over 10 per cent of the intangibles at Â£240m. Pergamon was sold in May for Â£445m cash,\" Mr Maxwell said. Mr Ernest Burrington, manag- ing director of MGN, said: \"Our newspaper games have been and are conducted in accordance with usual newspaper practices in a similar way to our competitors.\" Sources close to Mr Maxwell's bankers yesterday indicated that disposals to raise Â£300m-Â£400m were planned before Christmas, and the first would be announced within four weeks. If completed, the disposals would settle a large part of the next $750m debt repayment due by October 1992. MCC's present net debt is believed to be Â£1.35bn. Heading the list of likely candi- dates for disposal is Berlitz, the language and educational pub- lisher, 56 per cent owned by Max- well Communication and 44 per cent floated on the New York Stock Exchange. At yesterday's price of $18.75, it is valued at $356.3m. Other probable disposal candi- dates are Macdonald books in the UK, and a school books joint ven- ture with McGraw Hill, the US publisher. Earlier this week MCC sold Maxwell Macmillan Professional and Business Reference Publish- ing, a loss-making US subsidiary, to Thomson Professional Publish- ing for Â£56.5m.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "sda, the UK's fourth larg- est grocery chain with about 8 per cent of the market, has fallen badly out of favour with the City. The company's failure to find a new chief executive to replace Mr John Hardman - who abruptly quit in June - has irritated insti- tutional investors who perceive the company to be drifting with- out direction at a time when it urgently needs a clear strategy. Shareholders were further incensed by Sir Godfrey Mes- servy's comments last week. The departing chairman, who will be succeeded by Mr Patrick Gillam, told the company's annual meet- ing of a \"very significant deterio- ration\" in projected profits for the current year. And speculation in the market that Asda will seek fresh funds to reduce its mountain of debt - estimated at more than Â£lbn - has thrown up further uncer- tainty, which the company has declined to dispel. All these worries are reflected in Asda's shares, which are 59%p, or less than a third of the high they reached in 1987. The market values Asda at only Â£710m, a level surely low enough to attract a potential predator, if one exists. Some analysts speculate that Asda will not be around in its present form for much longer. The company's competitors cer- tainly mutter as much under their breath. Several institutions privately pray for a takeover by a conti- nental competitor believing this would be in the best interests of employees, consumers and, of course, the funds they manage. That Asda should have reached such a state is an indictment of its management. \"I think the company is solely at fault for the mess it has got itself into,\" says one fund manager. Asda's problems have not emerged overnight, however, and institutional shareholders must share some responsibility for allowing them to persist. \"Asda * has stood still for years in a mar- i ket in which you cannot afford to stand still for a month,\" says one f industry observer. Although it was the first chain i to see the potential for edge-of- * town superstores, Asda steadily lost ground to its ferocious rivals, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, i which all seized upon on the ben- efits of centralised distribution t systems, the development of own- label products and computerised point-of-sale equipment. There appeared to be few com- plaints from institutions when the company expanded away from its heartland in the north of England to compete head-on with Tesco and Sainsbury in the south and wasted management effort on briefly diversifying into home furnishings. Nor was there much opposition when the company paid Â£705m to buy 60 Gateway stores in 1989, largely the cause of Asda's debt problem. Institutional discontent was partly responsible for Mr Hard- man's departure. This has left the company rudderless, how- ever, while Asda's rivals have been seizing the initiative by tap- ping the equity market. However, institutional inves- tors defend themselves against such criticism and deny that they were responsible for ousting Mr Hardman before a new manage- ment team could be put in place. Mr Roger Yates, a fund manager with Morgan Grenfell Group, with a sizeable shareholding in Asda, says: \"I think the role of behind- the-scenes institutional pressure can be overstated. I have never been in any smoke-filled rooms myself.\" The institutions also suggest it is not their job to run a company; they can only ensure that the composition of the board is such that effective executive manage- ment can be implemented. \"At the end of the day it is up to the management to manage,\" says one fund manager. What clearly emerges is that the institutions can highlight problems and prevent the worst of excesses, but can propose few, if any, constructive solutions. Prof Paul Marsh, of the London Business School, argues that the nature of institutional sharehold- ings militates against investors taking early action. Because institutional investors have to watch many companies at the same time, he says, \"insti- tutional interventions by and large come too late. You cannot get collective action until the problems are well recognised.\" Institutions now suggest Asda has to recruit a credible chief executive, sort out its strained balance sheet, retrench to its core business and trading area and develop and communicate an effective strategy for the future. \"Either the company needs to be soundly financed with a qual- ity management team in place or it would be better for all con- cerned if it became part of a wider group with stronger finances,\" says one big institu- tional investor. A bid from one of the big three UK food retailers would almost certainly be blocked on competi- tion grounds. Continental retail- ers such as Metro International, Tengelmann and Aldi face no such problem and are seen in London as potential bidders. Seen from Germany, however, such prospects appear slimmer. Local retailers are focusing their atten- tion on the opportunities offered by re-unification. Tengelmann, the privately owned supermarket company which controls A&P in the US and thus has a (recently reduced) stake in the UK's Gateway chain, 1S \" \"offr yMasewy a Patdcic GUam ~ ' 1 1 1IaB Â·tW9s' 1891 has denied any interest in Asda. it plans to invest around DM300m (Â£100m) a year in east Germany over the next few years. Metro, a Swiss-owned cash-and-carry company, would not comment yesterday. As the majority owner of Kaufhof, one of west Germany's biggest retail groups, it is also involved in expansion eastwards. Kaufhof's east German investments will exceed DM400m this year. Aldi has already entered the UK market in its own right, with its distinctive formula of low prices and tightly controlled product ranges. Meanwhile, Asda presses on with its search for a chief execu- tive and an infusion of cash. S.G. Warburg and Cazenove - the financial advisers responsible for Burton Group's recent refinanc- ing - are believed to be working on a similar project for Asda, although the pricing of any rights issue will be tricky. \"Betting blind on a non-exis- tent management team is quite a hard thing to ask shareholders to do,\" says one fund manager.

   "text_content" : "Neil Buckley, Paul Abrahams and Richard Donkin on how the arms maker was misled by Gechem or as long as anyone could remember, before it was bought by a group of entrepreneurs in 1981, Astra was one of those once-a- year fireworks companies that lit up the sky and its balance sheet on November 5. Then it fizzled like a damp squib for the remainder of the calendar. Gerald James and Christo- pher Gumbley - an unlikely pairing, one an upper-crust chartered accountant, the other a former army corporal - formed the nucleus of the company that bought Astra and embarked on a 10-year mission to transform the straightforward fireworks man- ufacturer into a leading inter- national armaments company capable of taking on the UK's market leader, Royal Ord- nance. The story of how this former pyrotechnics company left a trail of acquisitions throughout the arms industry and flared briefly before it was all but snuffed out is perhaps one of the most intriguing corporate lessons of the 1980s. It features big players of the corporate finance business, captains of industry and the twilight world of the intelli- gence community. It ended in financial ruin for two men, the downfall of the company and the end of a deal to build the largest gun the world has ever seen. One of the lasting questions asked by former members of Astra's board is how the com- pany came to be guided along an acquisition trail that led to Poudreries Rdunies de Bel- gique. Were they and they alone to blame for Astra's downfall, or were they also badly advised by people and companies that should have known better? The seeds of Astra's prob- lems were sown in a number of earlier takeovers, including the acquisition of the British Man- ufacture and Research Com- pany (BMARC), an ammuni- tion company and subsidiary of Oerlikon of Switzerland, based near Grantham in Lin- colnshire. The takeover was funded by a Â£30m rights issue. Gerald James says the Astra board had been told by Sir Peter Levene, then head of pro- curement at the Ministry of Defence, that he wanted a com- petitor to Royal Ordnance (now a British Aerospace sub- sidiary), which at the time had a near-monopoly on ammuni- tion supplies to the UK forces. Astra executives thought this meant they would be able to compete head on with Royal Ordnance on all contracts. But they were disappointed. Before Astra completed the takeover of BMARC, the MoD had signed a deal called the Explo- sives and Propellants Agree- ment. This assured 80 per cent of ammunition contracts would automatically go to Royal Ord- ance for the next five years, leaving 20 per cent open for competition. If the BMARC deal turned out be a costly mistake, the acquisition of PRB would turn out to be catastrophic. Accord- ing to a lengthy report on Astra, lodged with the Depart- ment of Trade and Industry by Gerald James, its former chair- man, the purchase of PRB was first mooted in the summer of 1988 by PaineWebber, the then merchant bankers and advisers of Astra. Encouraged, according to James, by some of its biggest investors, the Astra board enthusiastically pursued the deal that would bring the com- pany to its knees. On July 17, 1989, when James signed the 73-page contract that would eventually give him control of PRB, the directors of Gechem, PRB's holding company, held their breath. They knew some- thing he did not. He was being sold a pup. His confidence that the acquisition would shoot his company into the first division of defence manufacturers was to be short lived. Monday September 11, 1989 heralded a week of surprises for the Astra management which culminated in the dis- covery that PRB would not reach the 1989 BFr6bn (Â£100m) turnover target quoted during negotiations by Gechem. The shortfall was confirmed by Jean Duronsoy, Gechem's chief executive. The immediate implications were grim. Instead of contributing profits of BFrlSOm, the Belgian sub- sidiary was likely to prove a significant drain on Astra's already stretched cash posi- tion. This hammer blow came 'All negotiations with Astra have been based on a 1989 results scenario ... For various reasons this scenario has not held true. To our knowledge, the management of Astra has not been informed by Gechem\" - 1989 memo from Guy Cardinael, man- ager, PRB when Astra managers were already reeling from being told by PRB executives earlier in the week of an order for Jor- dan, placed by a company owned by Gerald Bull, the Canadian ballistics expert. They suspected the orders were really for Iraq and Bull's life-long project to build the world's biggest gun. Astra handed over full details of the orders to M16. The problem was a potentially thorny one for the British gov- ernment, which had just been told that the Belgian subsid- iary of a quoted British com- pany was supplying gunpow- der almost certainly destined for Iraq. This was technically a breach of UK policy on arms sales to Iraq, though it was not illegal since the guardians of I that policy were Customs and i Excise, which only had juris- i diction over exports from the * UK. In fact, MI6 gave its bless- I in the second batch of pro- The potential embarrass- Sment and the contract neatly disappeared before the year r was out. In December, an i explosion at PRB's Kaulille i plant in northern Belgium wrecked the press used to extrude the propellants for the Iraqi supergun contract. Three months later, in March 1989, Gerald Bull was shot dead out- side his Brussels flat. An hour earlier he had finished a day- long meeting with Christopher Gumbley, former chief execu- I tive at Astra. Bull had produced sensitive documents at the meeting but exactly what he told Gumbley has never been fully revealed. Company sources say Bull sympathised with Astra because at one stage, he, too, i had been interested in buying PRB on behalf of Iraq. A third i man at the meeting, Harald i Crantz, an associate of Bull, was so terrified on hearing about the murder that he barrni- caded himself in his room and left for Austria on the first available flight. Gumbley had just been thrown off the Astra board and [ was looking for any help he could get. By spring 1990, the full extent of the catastrophe i that had overtaken Astra had * become clear. t The company had plunged i into the red, recording a loss of Â£9.5m - thanks largely to a Â£12m deficit by PRB - com- pared with the Â£15m profit ana- lysts had earlier predicted. Its share price would plummet to a low of 5.5p from a 1989 peak of 170p. No help came. Institutional shareholders had ousted all but one of the directors - and four of them were soon to be arrested by MoD police. One, Gumbley, was later jailed for bribing an MoD official. In July 1990, PRB became one of Belgium's biggest-ever corporate bankruptcies. More than 1,400 employees lost their jobs. During demonstrations against the closures in the cen- tre of Brussels, a woman was killed by a stray police bullet. Troops were called out to guard the munitions sites after U -Z.N, k L4Ei7 I -.f Explosive Ingredients: PRB powderkeg, Iraqi supergun and the men Involved with one of Belglum's biggest corporate collapses. Left to right: Herv6 de Carmoy, former chief executive of Socl6t6 G6n6rale de Belgique, Jean Duronsoy, of Gechem, and Gerald James and Christopher Gumbley, of Astra n an incident when there was nearly a second explosion at one of PRB's plants. The trail to PRB's demise had started in 1988, when Societd Gdndrale de Belgique, Gechem's main shareholder, emerged from its year-long takeover battle with Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier, and decided to dispose of its. least profitable subsidiaries. The loss-making munitions business was a prime candi- date for disposal. Closure was ruled out because of the costs of clearing polluted sites, dis- posing of tonnes of high-explo- sive and laying off 1,400 employees. When Jean Duronsoy had announced in November 1988 that PRB was for sale, Astra was already in discussions with Gechem over a possible purchase. Strategically, it seemed a perfect match. PRB would give Astra access to new technology and plant Early in 1989, Astra was told that PRB, which had made substantial losses in the previous two years, was set to make a profit that year of BFrl50Om, on a turnover of BFr6bn. Astra was grievously misled. At the start of 1989, PRB's internal management reports showed that potential orders for that year stood at only BFr5.5bn, plus a risky BFr400m contract for Zambia. Even this figure was a maximum, because lead times for PRB were at least 10 months and any order not on the books at the start of the year was unlikely to make it into that year's turnover. The order position grew worse and the turnover target was revised downwards in March, and again in May, to a new, \"realistic\" figure of BFr5.25bn, a shortfall equiva- lent to Â£12.5m compared with the figure given to Astra. Phil- lipe Glibert, PRB's deputy gen- eral manager, signed his May report, circulated to the PRB board, \"douloureusement votre\" (\"yours painfully\"). The Gechem board was nego- tiating the company sale alone and PRB managers had been warned by Duronsoy not to talk to Astra. PRB manage- ment only found out what was happening when, at the end of May, they saw that a piece of paper accidentally left behind by Rend Gregoire, Gechem's finance director, showed that the projections being given to Astra did not include the downgraded turnover figures. The first thing that the PRB managers did was to think of their own skins. Guy Cardinael and Philippe Glibert warned Duronsoy in a memo: \"The per- ception we have today of a probable slide in important fig- ures will certainly make the collective position of the pres- ent management perilous the day after the acquisition, if this goes ahead.\" Cardinael followed-up the memo with a more strongly worded note that said: \"It is useful to mention that all nego- tiations with Astra have been based on an '89 results sce- nario established in October 1988. For various reasons (nota- bly politics) this scenario has not held true, it has been revised downwards since March 1989. To our knowledge, the management of Astra has not up to now been informed of this by Gechem.\" In a classic understatement the memo added: \"The (PRB) manage- ment anticipates a negative reaction from the new share- holder.\" Three weeks after this memo was written, Astra signed a binding agreement for the acquisition of PRB, still unaware of the changes in PRB's turnover projections. The agreement in July gave full rights of access to PRB's documents until completion of the deal in September. In prac- tice, Gechem controlled the flow of information. An inter- nal note from Philippe Jous, Gechem's legal adviser, to Duronsoy, remarked: \"The management of PRB must without delay inform Gechem - and only Gechem - of any event or circumstance which could modify the financial or commercial situation of PRB. Once again, it is up to Gechem to decide to what extent infor- mation of this type should or should not be transmitted to Astra.\" Gechem did not inform Astra of the final downwards revision of the turnover, even though it had undertaken to consult regularly with Astra about PRB. A report by Glibert in August concluded that the turnover target was now just below BFr4.8bn, the equivalent of more than Â£18m less than the figure quoted to Astra - certain to plunge PRB into a considerable loss for the year. This information was clearly known to Duronsoy three weeks before the final comple- tion, but was not passed on. Instead, he waited until Sep- tember 18, a week after the deal was completed, when in a letter he finally revealed: \"Present forecast of PRB results for 1989 is rather disap- 'Buying PRB was the maddest thing they ever did. Everyone in the business knew it had been technically bankrupt for years. When I heard they were going to pay something like Â£20m for it I nearly col- lapsed' - former Astra associate pointing and we are much con- cerned.\" There was likely to be a slippage in turnover, he said, of \"roughly BFrlbn\". The result of this was quite clear to PRB. The company had pre- pared a report in September which suggested losses for 1989 would reach at least Â£llm. Gechem, in its defence, claims Astra and its advisers had ample opportunity to establish PRB's true position; and it points out that no pre- dictions about turnover were included in any of the con- tracts. Duronsoy argues that Astra and its accountants were given adequate access to PRB's records but argued that the company did not take full advantage of the opportunity. \"I don't know why Astra was surprised [by the turnover fig- ures]. I have been told a lot less during acquisitions than what we told [Astra during the PRB sale],\" Duronsoy told the Financial Times. \"During the summer of 1989 we started to question whether Astra was capable of taking over the company... We became worried whether they were not taking it seriously,\" said Jous, Gechem's legal vice-president. Gechem's other main defence is that at no stage did the various contracts and memoranda of understanding mention Gechem's turnover. Furthermore, although there was a warranty in the final contract which guaranteed a profit at PRB of BFrl50m, there was no further compen- sation available in the event of a loss. The absence of warranties for potential losses - in spite of PRB's combined losses before tax during 1987 and 1988 of more than BFr2.4bn - is cited by the present Astra board as one of the reasons they accepted compensation of Â£3.3m by Gechem and had not pursued legal action in 1990. They realised also that legal action could take up to five years and at the time the com- pany was desperate for any cash it could get its hands on. Astra's management at the time of the takeover was not blameless for the fiasco, according to the company's present management, which says that anyone reading the warnings in Stoy Hayward's report about PRB before the acquisition should not have proceeded with the purchase. Although Astra was one of fastest-growing companies of the 1980s, former employees are less than complimentary about the skills of its manage- ment. One former associate noted: \"Buying PRB was the maddest thing they ever did. Everyone in the pyrotechnics business knew it had been technically bankrupt for years. When I heard they were going to pay something like Â£20m for it I nearly collapsed.\" In his statement to the DTI, however, James has stressed that he and Gumbley were being enthusiastically encour aged to get on with the deal by executives whose experience and views they respected. One of the main supporters, says James, was Stephan Kock, a non-executive director of Astra and former consultant to the Midland Bank who is the only boardroom survivor from the time of the PRB acquisi- tion. Kock refuses to discuss the matter. This may be an attempt to offset the blame, although James feels that some individu als on both sides of the deal could have done more to over- see what was going on. Only a few months earlier Herv6 de Carmoy, the chairman of Gechem, had left the most highly paid post at Midland as head of the International Divi- sion. De Carmoy, the chief execu- tive of Societd Gdenrale de Bel- gique at the time of the PRB sale has stressed that he had no dealings in the sale negotia- tions. \"You have to understand there were 1,200 companies in Socidt6 Gdndrale de Belgique at this time,\" he said. James has urged the DTI to take note of connections between a series of individuals, some with former intelligence backgrounds who took a deep interest in Astra's affairs throughout its brief history but this would appear to be beyond the inquiry's remit. That PRB was dealing in a dirty business, often with exor- bitant amounts paid in com- mission to third parties who do little but \"arrange\" a deal, became apparent in the imme- diate aftermath of the collapse as Astra and PRB executives exchanged accusations of impropriety. The size of com- missions on some export con- tracts is one outstanding area of investigation. In March 1990, Gerald James resigned as chairman. His replacement was Roy Barber, who had previously been appointed a non-executive director on the suggestion of Prudential. Two weeks later, during a stormy board-meet- ing, Barber asked for the resig- nations of Astra's executive directors, following revelations they had known that Gumbley, Astra's then chief executive, had offered gifts to MoD offi- cials. After his appointment as chairman of Astra, Barber ini- tially took a tough line with Gechem, threatening to rescind the contract if the Belgian company did not buy back PRB for the Â£20m paid. Astra even- tually accepted the Â£3.3m set- tlement. Barber justified the small amount by arguing the money was needed urgently to pay the company's bankers. The chances of the DTI inspectors discovering the full story of the Astra debacle are few. The DTI has no right to subpoena Belgian nationals liv- ing in Belgium. And although some Belgian participants in the saga have agreed to complete question- naires containing up to 250 questions, many have refused to give any details.",

The balance has been under- written by NM Rothschild and the brokers are County Nat- West Wood Mackenzie. In light of the recession over- hanging the UK engineering industry, Mr Ken Coates, exec- utive chairman, stressed that the rights was not \"a hospital job, but about building the group for the future.\" A number of its businesses were, or were becoming, real market leaders and would require investment in new products and some manufac- turing capacity to maintain their position. But Meggitt also wanted to develop new mar- kets for its products. \"There is no doubt we see the 1990s strongly influenced by the need to sell globally,\" he said. Over the past year Meggitt had clearly signalled it was stressing organic growth over purchases, but saw the number of quality acquisition opportu- nities increasing. Most pros- pects were overseas, particu- larly in the US and Germany, said Mr Coates. The announcement was cou- pled with a rise in first-half profits from Â£12.2m to Â£12.3m pre-tax, on turnover ahead to Â£150.9m (Â£148.4m). Earnings per share rose from 5p to 5.3p and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p (1.lp). The results, which are likely to contrast sharply with others in the sector, were attributed I to early anticipation of the , recession, leading to a very i substantial reduction in work- ing capital, and 1,000 job cuts over the past 12 months, reduc- ing the workforce to just over 6,000. The aerospace division per- formed surprisingly well, lift- ing turnover and profit helped i by a shift from defence to civil work. The controls side was boosted by activity in reunified Germany, and electronics at least improved on its perfor- mance in the second half of 1990. The energy division had a slow first half, due partly to the Gulf crisis, but has received a number of sizeable orders in the past three months. * COMMENT A rights issue in the middle of I a recession will test Mr Coates' contention that the United Sci- entific Holdings bid debacle is now history. The dropped bid left burnt fingers in the City, but the share price reaction i yesterday - down just 3p at i 99p - suggested the shock waves have subsided. With a fairly robust medium term out- look, a rights makes sense, says Mr Andy Chambers at Nomura Research Institute - and a raised dividend and slightly increased profits is another way of winning back friends. Meggitt is clearly bene- siting from having spotted storm clouds ahead as early as April 1990, and battening down the hatches. A reduced reli- ance on defence work and increased physical presence in Germany and France have helped, and the interest bill, up 77 per cent at the year-end, has been pegged back. Barring disasters, Meggitt ought to be able to exceed last year's Â£23.8m pre-tax by a million or two.",

Leucadia, a 48.5 per cent shareholder in the Milton Keynes-based precision engi- neering group, will propose at the extraordinary meeting on October 1 to replace three Molins directors with six of its own choice. If successful, the proposals would give it board control. At the same meeting Molins will itself ask for shareholder permission to increase its share capital by about 27 per cent. A spokesman at Hambros Bank, Leucadia's adviser, said: \"If shareholders thought that by voting against Leucadia they would precipitate a bid, this will set them straight\". Leucadia's position is condi- tional on Molins' financial position, profitability and share price. Lazard Brothers, Molins adviser, said: \"This statement merely emphasises Leucadia's real motive of seizing control without making a full offer to shareholders\".",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "I By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE DEPTH of the recession in UK and US construction markets is plain to see from interim profit figures announced yesterday by Tarmac. The group, which has exten- sive building materials and construction businesses in both countries, suffered set- backs in all but one of its seven operating divisions: * UK Housebuilding: Profits declined by 71 per cent to Â£9.9m (Â£34.1m). as the number of homes sold by the group fell by 36 per cent from 4,745 to 3,031. Sir Eric Pountain, chair- man, said that sales improved in the second half and the group expects to sell between 10,500 to 11,000 homes this year compared with 11,209 in 1990 and 12,085 in 1989. Average prices in the first half rose by about 3 per cent to between Â£78,000 to Â£79,000. The rise disguised the large dis- counts which are still being offered by Tarmac and other UK housebuilders in a bid to maintain cash flow and encour- age sales. Operating margins on house sales fell from 9.2 per cent to just 4 per cent. * UK Quarry Products: Prof- its were hit hard by the con- struction recession, falling by 40 per cent from Â£40.3m to Â£24m. Demand for ready mixed concrete fell by 14 per cent, crushed stone by 12 per cent, Tarmac' Operating profits Em (half years to June 30) Quarry products Housing Constructior Building materials Industrial products Properties Tarmac America -5 0 5 10 15 u a awu 0o wU 45 sand and gravel by 22 per cent and coated road materials by 6 per cent. Prices have come under pressure as the group has fought to maintain market share. = Contracting: This was the only division to show any improvement, with profits ris ing marginally from Â£10.6m to Â£10.7m. Orders and margins are expected to decline as a result of the severe downturn in commercial property mar kets. * Building Materials: The division comprises mainly bricks, concrete blocks and tiles. It has suffered badly as a result of the UK housing mar- ket collapse. Most of Tarmac's brickmaking plants were closed for about 10 weeks at the beginning of this year and as a result profits tumbled from Â£7.9m to just Â£100,000. * America: The group said conditions in the US, where it has large aggregate, cement and building products inter- ests, have been even worse than in the UK. Construction markets in Florida and Vir- ginia, key states for the group, wo seL weiweeun 1u,ow uu 11,000 homes this year have 'been particularly diffi- cult. Profits fell from Â£15.1m to Â£500,000. * Industrial Products: The manufacture and installation of roofing products comprises the biggest element of the divi- sion. This struggled in the UK but performed a little better in continental Europe. Profits fell by 52 per cent from Â£19.7m to Â£9.4m. * Properties: This division incurred a loss of Â£2.5m com- pared with profits of Â£12.1m last time. This market is likely to remain very difficult.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper DOMESTIC & General Group, the specialist domestic appli- ance breakdown insurer, reported a 46 per cent increase, from Â£3.4m to Â£4.95m, in pre- tax profits for the year to June 30 1991. From earnings of 48.11p (31.37p) the final dividend is 10.5p for a total of 15p (10.5p), a rise of 43 per cent. The market responded posi- tively to the figures, which fol- lowed three years of growth since D&G's launch on the USM in May 1988. The shares finished the day at 753p, up 25p. Following unsuccessful diversification the group was focusing increasingly on domestic appliance business, insuring both white goods - such as refrigerators and cook- ers - and brown goods - audio equipment, televisions - against breakdown. Premiums income increased by 44 per cent to Â£33.3m, the bulk coming from the core domestic appliance business. Income from brokerage com- mission amounted to Â£546,000 (Â£689,000) and investment income Â£5.16m (Â£4.08m). Mr Martin Copley, chairman, explained that the call for breakdown insurance products had proved resilient despite depressed demand in the retail sector. This was partially because retailers, who earn a commission of about 25 per cent of premium on all policies sold, have been anxious to increase sales as a means of generating additional income. \"We also believe that con- sumer demand for our prod- ucts is increasing due to the ever growing dependence upon appliances in the home.\" In addition premium rates have been increased by between 5 and 10 per cent over the year. About 60 per cent of the premiums were annual, another 40 per cent were pre- miums covering a period of up to five years. D&G was aiming to build on existing agreements with man- ufacturers, which it saw as an important means of increasing its share of the UK market, which it currently estimated to be about 10 per cent. The group was also aiming to expand overseas business, especially in Europe. Pilot operations had been launched in France and Belgium and the group was examining the pos- sibility of expansion into the Spanish market. Following the sale of motor- ists' uninsured loss business and the withdrawal from mort- gage broking, over 90 per cent of turnover and contribution was domestic appliance related.",

The company called the $12.7m (Â£7.5m) contract with the US Air Force security police the most significant recent breakthrough for Racal's radio group. Racal said the timing of the announcement was not dic- tated by the Â£701m hostile bid from Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, last Tuesday. However, Mr David Elsbury, Racal's deputy chief executive, repeated the assertion made before the Williams bid, that Racal's radio business would be a platform of strength for the new group, which has traded without its 80 per cent stake in Vodafone, the cellular radio operator, since Septem- ber 16. The initial contract for the Scope Shield II radio system is for only 600 units and related equipment for delivery over two years from 1993. Racal will initially supply more than 30 USAF bases but has been told there is potential for sales to more than 230 military facill- ties. The USAF's Electronics Sys- tem Division (ESD) has said the potential value of the open-ended contract is $120m over seven years. Mr Elsbury, said other parts of the US defence establishment could provide a $840m market over i a decade. t The Williams camp was r unruffled by the announce- ment. \"We would not expect Racal to stop doing what it 3 does Just because of our bid,\" i an adviser said. 1 The BSD is being kept r informed of the Racal bid. 1 Williams shares closed ) unchanged at 386p and Racal I was %p lower at 56p.

Tae 20m development costs, of which $10m was provided by the US government, have already been written off above the line.

Net interest payments fell from Â£3m to Â£300,000, due to payments from an insurance policy against high rates taken out in 1987. Net debt was \"19.2m, with gearing at 18 per cent. \"We were a bit disap- pointed,\" said Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman and chief executive. \"We had expected to come out of recession when in fact we have just bottomed out.\" However, the group's \"three-legged stool\" philosophy had been proven to work, he said, with some businesses bol- stering others in recession. Hays, which was floated in October 1989, is divided into three divisions: commercial, distribution and personnel. Strong gains in the first two offset the sharp decline in per- sonnel, which mainly supplies accountancy staff. That divi- sion suffered a 28 per cent fall in turnover and a Â£7.4m drop in profits to Â£11.6m. Mr Frost said an even sharper fall had been averted by quick action to cut costs and improve effi- clency. Staff was down from 1,379 to 849. Commercial and distribution were less vulnerable to a down- turn, he said. Operating profits in the commercial business, which provides office support services, were 33 per cent higher at Â£16.6m. Distribution, the group's core business with 51 per cent of profits, boosted its return by 5 per cent to Â£28.9m. Mr Frost said the five acqui- sitions during the year, repre- senting a total investment of Â£23m, had contributed little to profits. \"They barely covered their financing costs,\" he said. However, they would \"contrib- ute royally next year\". The group is looking for fur- ther acquisitions, mainly in the i UK, France and Germany. It * has embarked on two joint ven- i tures with French companies covering water treatment chemicals and the recycling of solvents. Although Mr Frost said he I had not yet seen any sign of an I upturn, prospects for next year were not bad. \"At least I don't see things getting any worse.\" Two new contracts signed include a 25-year distribution deal with Waitrose, the super- market chain, and five-year contract with brewers Scottish & Newcastle.

It also announced its largest order to date - a Â£6m contract to build modular buildings for the aerospace industry. \"Hard work in a difficult marketplace\" had pulled the merged group out of the red, said Mr Noel Hayes, managing director.

The group is paying a divi- dend of 0.03p, leaving a retained loss of Â£176,000. \"We are confident that we will make a healthy profit for shareholders in the second half,\" said Mr Hayes. Turnover fell from Â£13.4m to Â£8.5m, following the sale of all but one of Whittington's busi- nesses - a small greeting card company. The main purpose of the reverse takeover had been to move Ross from a USM quo- tation to the full listing enjoyed by Whittington. Mr Hayes said Ross was increasingly concentrating on higher margin areas, such as camcorder batteries. It was also moving out of the portable audio sector, to avoid \"head to head competition with Japa- nese brands\".

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard ADMINISTRATORS OF Polly Peck International, the col- lapsed fruit and electronics conglomerate, said yesterday that they were making prog- Ma in gettig land held by developers in northern Cyprus back munder their control. Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, the senior adminlstra- tor, said that a list of develop- ments on the island was slowly being transferred back into the ownership of names under the group's control. But he warned that there would have to be a \"sea- change\" in the tourism market in northern Cyprus before some of the assets could be made to contribute strongly to the group's profits and that cash would have to be pro- duced to develop the sites. Many of the sites mentioned were bought in the closing months of Polly Peck's slide into administration. Mr Richard Stone, the corpo- rate finance specialist on the three man administration team, yesterday flew back into London after completing his latest talks with the Turkish Cypriots. He is believed to have won an agreement from the Turk- ish Cypriot authorities to soften restrictions on access to records and accounts held on the island which has been blocked by an injunction brought in November last year by a group of Turkish Cypriot orange farmers. He hopes to unlock up to Â£200m in Polly Peck funds which may still be held on deposit in the island. It emerged yesterday that the administrators have still not spoken fully to Erdal & Co, the small Turkish Cypriot accountancy house which audited the Turkish and Turk- ish Cypriot subsidiaries of Polly Peck which contributed the main part of the group's profits. Mr Jordan, who flew to Tokyo yesterday afternoon to put a rescue plan to the board of Sansui,'he Japanese con- sumer eItorenics subsidiary of Polly kP , appeared confi- dent that the group will be able to continue as a single trading entity. trading entity."

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller -nay Anarews Taking over the board: left to right, Sir Ian MacGregor, Keith Anderson, Pierre Besuchet and Eric Kohn at yesterday's meeting DISSIDENT shareholders in Holmes Protection Group, the London-listed, but US-based security concern, appeared to have won control of the board last night after a special general meeting in London. The challengers, called the Investor Group, had built up a 27 per cent stake in Holmes and won support of other institutions, one of which assigned its support at the last minute, after gaining assurances about directors' pay, expenses and severance conditions. The meeting considered the election of five of the group's nominees to the board. The group, brought together by Mr Eric Kohn, chairman of Barons Financial Services (UK), includes Sir lan MacGregor, former chairman of British Steel and British Coal, as well as Scottish Amicable. Sir Ian told the meeting he had offered in May to \"lead the charge\" in renegotiating Holmes's $66m (Â£38m) debt with the lenders, \"many of whom I have had business with over the years\". Mr Tom Mayer, Holmes's chairman, said his offer had been rejected because it included invit- ing other members of the group on to the board. \"I feel that to take control of the company they should buy 51 per cent of the shares.\" Sir Ian replied that even a 100 per cent pre- mium to the market price, 5%p yesterday, would be worth little. \"It is better to rebuild the company. We don't want to steal it from you.\" The incumbent management tried to gain the meeting's support for a plan to restructure the group's debt. This included reducing the inter- est rate on senior notes from 10.72 per cent to 8 per cent, repaying $25m by September 1993, sell- ing operations outside New York and converting $15m debt into equity, giving the lenders a 33 per cent holding. The Investor Group has criticised virtually every point. It said the plan \"has no chance of success and the company's shareholders will lose all of their investment if it is adopted\". Mr Mayer faced several awkward questions from shareholders. Mr John Wheatley asked whether the group was right to suggest that the remaining New York operation would have insufficient operating profit to service the $20m debt that would remain. Mr Mayer replied that last year New York accounted for about two thirds of the business. It made $9.8m operating profit before allocating central costs of $8m. He described the group's figures as nonsense because they appeared to allocate all the central costs to New York. He envisaged the remaining operation as making a 10 per cent return, at the operating level, on annual sales of $47m, which would be sufficient to service $20m debt. Mr Mayer was more discomfited by a question on how the $2.4m decline in interim turnover was split between New York and other operations. He started to dig in his briefcase to try to find the breakdown, but was told not to bother. \"The significance is that you don't know. That's what shareholders are worried about.\" Mr John Watt said: \"I believe that had Sir Ian MacGregor been chairman, the lenders would have seen him sooner and things would have proceeded in a different way.\"",

   "text_content" : "By MIGhlyo Nkamoto. CONTINUING WEAKNESS in its core aerospace, industrial and electronics businesses were behind a 32 per cent decline in interim profits at Brent Chemicals International, the Buckinghamshire-based speciality chemicals group. Pre-tax profits fell to Â£4.61m from a previous Â£6.81m on turnover up to Â£49.9m (45.1m). \"There has not been any improvement in worldwide market conditions,\" observed Lord Lane of Horsell, chair- man. The company is exposed to a number of sectors that have been badly affected by the cur- rent recession. Its industrial systems divi- sion, which provides chemicals and processing systems for metal finishing, was particu-. larly hurt by the downturn in the UK. The UK metal finish- ing business accounts for about 12.5 per cent of overall turnover. Demand from the aerospace industry for the group's testing chemicals and cleaning com- pounds remained sluggish as the civil aerospace sector was depressed during the Gulf war and failed to emerge from its gloom in the following months. \"We all had to contend with the fear of flying during the Gulf war,\" said Mr Steve Cuth- bert, chief executive. The division, which is ori- ented towards the civil aero- space side, was hit across the board geographically. Weak demand in the US affected the electronics divi- sion, which provides chemicals used in the preparation of printed circuit boards. The combined contribution to pre-tax profits from the industrial, aerospace and elec- Steve Cuthbert: Gulf war led to fear of flying tronics operations fell 38 per cent to Â£2.65m (Â£4.m). Interest income, which at Â£432,000 declined to less than half the previous EÂ£L3m. The fall in was due to invest- ment last year of approxi- mately Â£20m in the Europeap packaging and graphic art* operations. The division, which supplies inks, coatings and adhesivei, was the most resilient, increas ing its profits contribution to Â£2.14m (Â£1.92m). I Net cash at the year end is expected to total 3im against borrowings of Â£700,000, Mt Cuthbert said. The interim dividend i1 maintained at 1.6p and the company intends to recomi mend a final dividend not less than the 5.8p paid last year. Earnings per share declined td 4.6p (7p)."

   "text_content" : "Guy de Jonqui6res on Kwik Save's ability to beat the recession A SITE A decade of beady xanimon, reces d~si emr shally to be catclngup with Britain's food retailingInduastry. Asda and Gateway are struggling with massive debt and management upheavals, while slower sales growth has recently rompted even the mighty JSainsbury and Teaco to cut prices. But judging by the perfor- mance of Kwit Save, the coun- try's leading discount super- market group, the recession might hardly have happened, If anything, it has strengthened the peal of Kwik Save's pol- icy under-cutting its arger rivals by as much as 10 per cent on branded grocery prices. The group, which claim 7.5 per cent of packaged grocery sales, says its turnover is still rising at an annual rate of about 17 per cent and that it is gainin market share. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-Au- gust are expected to top Â£100m, up from Â£85.lm in 19890. Indeed, Kwik Save's biggest worry is that its success is attracting keener competition, in particular from Aldi of Ger- many and Netto of Denmark. The aggressive price-cutting chains have together opened about 85 UK stores in the psut two years. Though the new- comers Ipact has been mod- est so t wik Save Is glrding itelf for battle. in the past five years, it has increased earnings per share at an annual compound rate of 21 per cent - second only to Teocm - by focusing on three priorities: * Keeping capital spending low. A typical Kwik Save store covers less than 10,000 eq ft and is located on the high street or on an inexpensive edge-of-town site. New store costs range from Â£400,000 to Â£1.Sm, compared with the Â£25m Tesoe and Sainsbury spend to build a 35,000 sq ft out-of-town superstore. Unlike its larger rivals, Kwik Save has financed recent expansion entirely from its own resources. Though its margin of almost 6 per cent on sales of Â£1.45bn last year was below Sainsbury's 8.6 per cent, Kwik Save's 41 per cent return on capital employed was the highest in the industry. * Stocking only well-known nationally branded goods and refusing to follow larger UK rivals' increasing reliance on own-label products. * Exte nive use of scanning and other sophisticated com- puterised 'systems to cut costs and improve effdency. The company, which oper- ates 744 stores, is now expand- ing eneretically beyond its traditon base in Lancashire and the Midlands. It aims to open 50 new stores in each of the next three years, princi- pally in north east and south east England. It is already ahead of schedule, having acquired 42 stores from Gate- way earlier this year. The group has met Aldi and Netto head-on by consistently matching their prices. Its main weapon is an expanding range of \"price-fighting\" products, second-rank brands for which manufacturers charge less than premium prices. M r Simon Moffat, group finance direc- tor, says direct com- petition from Aldi has brought a slight fall in gross margins, recouped so far through higher sales volumes. But repelling the newcomers will have some short term financial impact, notably on the return on capi- tal Mr Moffat expects it to edge down to about 35 per cent in the next two years, but to remain among the highest in the industry. \"Our strategy is not to let the foreign competi- tion in, so we won't try to max- imise short-term gains by keep- ing prices high,\" he says. \"Our objective is sustainable long-term earnings.\" He claims keener compe- tition will enlarge the discount sector, but he expects Aldi and Netto to be held back by a shortage of suit- able store sites and by small sales volumes, which will limit their ability to secure low prices from UK suppliers. But will all this be enough to keep competitors at bay indefi- nitely? After all, Kwik Save's strategy of keeping capital investments can, by definition, be emulated by others. Could its winning formula turn out longer-term to be its Achilles heel? \"I can't deny the main argu- ment,\" says Mr Moffat. \"Some- one with a lot of money can come in and do the same thing. But we have quite a lot of small advantages, based on 25 years' experience. If you add them all up, it won't be easy.\"",

Mr Albert Mucklow, chair- man, reported that lettings on the newly completed develop- ments at Rugby, Bedford and Farnborough had been disap- pointing. The vacancy rate on the existing industrial portfo- lio, he said, increased from 208,000 sq ft to 580,000 sq ft at the year end. That figure included 250,000 sq ft of older space on a part of the Saltley Trading Estate which was being redeveloped. A revaluation of commercial and industrial properties resulted in a Â£400,000 reduction in the revaluation reserve to 1187.8m. These figures have been incorporated in the accounts. In addition all the group's other properties, including stocks of underdevel- oped land, were also revalued giving rise to a surplus of Â£13.2m which had not been incorporated in the accounts.

In the year to December 31 the group made a pre-tax profit of IÂ£107,000 on turnover of IE10.4m. Mr Robert Ware, who took over as chairman after the res- ignation of Mr Bryan Burletson on July 1, said that the results reflected the fact that no prop- erty disposals had been made in the year to date. However, he added, in spite of difficulties prevailing in the property sector in Ireland and the UK, the board was continu- ing its efforts to enlarge the company through acquisition. Losses per share came out at 0.93p (2.1p earnings), and again there is no dividend. Everest Foods growth continues Continuing the trend in the first half Everest Foods reported record profits for the year to May 31.

Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said that the egg division had been able to increase profits despite pressure on margins but specialist food distribution had not maintained last year's performance. Earnings per share were 17.97p (12p) and the proposed final dividend is 4.6p for a total Of U8p (6p). The shares rose 6p to 181p.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre-maker, yesterday reported that its net group loss for the first half of the year had almost trebled to FFrl.O6bn ($170m). However, it said its recovery was still on target. The group, headed by chair- man Mr Francois Michelin (pic- tured), forecast that it would break even at the pre-tax level - after finance charges but before restructuring costs - in the final months of 1991, despite the continued down- turn in the US and European car markets. This points to a sharp reduc- tion in this year's group net loss, forecast by stockbroking analysts at between FFrl.5bn and FFr2bn, as against FFr4.8bn in 1991. Michelin's published turn- over rose to FFr32.97bn in the first half, against FFr27.22bn last time. Last year's figures include the first contribution from Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre-maker which Michelin took over at the end of 1989 and which came into the accounts from May 1990. Pro forma turnover fell by 1.1 per cent, from FFr27.19bn to FFr26.89bn. Within this, sales volume fell by 4.3 per cent, but mupact uy mnureasmi prwces and selling more replacement tyres, where margins are big- ger than on sales to car-mak- ers. If the market follows Miche- lin's US and European price rises on replacement tyres - and so allowing the.new prices to stick - there will be a FFr300m gain to sales and prof- its this year, said officials. Operating profits fell from FFrl.61bn to FFrl.26bn in the first half, where they were eas- ily wiped out by a 45 per cent rise in interest charges, from FFrl.06bn to FFrl.54bn. The interest increase reflects the debts built up to fund the acquisition of the heavily-bor- rowed Uniroyal Goodrich. The net lost in the first half of last year was FFr36Sm. Since the end of last year, net debts have risen further, from FFr28.5bn to FFr381.6bn by the end of June, representing 169 per cent of shareholders' funds. Of that increase, nearly 60 per cent is due to the rise in the dollar's value. Despite the debt burden, officials stressed there were no immediate plans for a rights issue. The pre-tax loss was FFr290m in the first half, as against a FFr548m profit. Exceptional charges rose from FFr402m to FFr632m, due mainly to the cost of the first steps in reducing Michelin's workforce by 15 per cent, or 16,000 people, in the two years to the end of 1992. Michelin expects around FFrlbn of exceptional charges in the current half, possibly rising to FPrl.4bn. It also expects to have reduced stocks by 10 per cent by the end of the year so that they stand at 25 per cent of turnover.",

   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonian PIRELLI, the Italian cables and tyres group, yesterday revealed the costs of its attempted take- over of its German rival, Conti- nental, with the announcement of a L65bn ($50.19m) loss for the first six months of this year. The company also warned that its losses were likely to rise for the year as a whole. Restructuring would cost L120bn, while there would be further financial burdens asso- ciated with the Continental bid. At the interim stage, the loss attributable to Pirelli, exclu- ding minority interests, was L44bn, against a net profit of L137bn for the same period in 1990. Sales in the first six months of this year fell by 3 per cent to L5,118bn. The company attributed the fall in profits to the general weakness of the tyre market and to the \"'extraordinary\" bur- den of its Continental initia- tive. However, it also warned that there had been a fall in sales in all its business activi- ties, and not just in tyres, in the first half of this year. Interest charges associated with building up its Continen- tal stake are likely to have been responsible for much of its troubles. The company, which is still trying to negoti- ate some form of co-operation with its German rival, owns 5 per cent of Continental's shares. It has also given guarantees to re-purchase a further 5 per cent stake formerly held by Sopaf, a small Italian merchant bank. Sopafs insistence that it has not taken a loss on its Con- tinental shares - despite the plunge in their market value - has aroused suspicion that Pirelli has offered it some form of indemnity. Pirelli gave no indication of its year-end results, partly because so much will depend on the outcome of its talks with Continental. According to Pirelli, the dis- cussions are being conducted in a \"constructive and friendly spirit\". However, the company gave no hint as to their scope nor whether the two compa- nies were nearing any conclu- sions. See World Stock Markets",

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson In New York BEILL ATLANTIC, one of the seven \"Baby Bell\" regional telephone companies, yester- day launched a $1.65bn agreed all-share takeover for Metro Mobile CTS, the second largest independent operator of cellu- lar telephone networks in the US. It will also take on some $80sm in Metro Mobile debt. The deal marks a significant expansion of Bell Atlantic's cellular operations and a fur- ther consolidation of the frag- mented cellular network. Bell Atlantic enjoys a regional telephone monopoly along the eastern seaboard of the US, between New Jersey and Virginia, and as far west as Pennsylvania and West Vir- ginia. It also has one of the two licences to operate cellu- lar phone systems in these areas, and has 22.1m \"pops\" - or head of population who could be served by its cellular network. The acquisition of Metro Mobile will add 11.5m pops and greatly extend Bell Atlan- tic's cellular operations in the eastern states outside its regional base. Metro Mobile has a strong presence in southern New England, partic- ularly in Connecticut. It also has operations in the fast-growing south-west - in Arizona, New Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. Mr Raymond Smith, chair- man of Bell Atlantic, said the deal would consolidate its position as the leading cellular company on the eastern sea- board and, over the long-term, would help the company get to the upper end of its 6 to 9 per cent annual earnings growth target. However, he acknowl- edged that in the first full year the deal would probably mean a 10 to 12 per cent dilution in Bell Atlantic's earnings. Metro Mobile, burdened with an extremely heavy debt load, had previously indicated that it intended to sell off assets. The company has around 800 employees and began to acquire cellular licences in 1982. More recently, however, it diversi- fled into the propane and natu- ral gas business, to the puzzle- ment of Wall Street analysts.",

   "text_content" : "By Haig Simonlan in Milan MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals and agro-industrial group, is selling its 50 per cent stake in the Ja/Mont tissue paper joint venture. The sale, worth $827m, is to Cragnotti & Partners Capital Investments, the investment banking group created earlier this year by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former top Montedison executive. Montedison established Ja/ Mont in December 1988 as a joint venture with James River Corporation of the US in a bid to create a pan-European paper group. Ja/Mont in turn con- trols the group's main operat- ing arm, in which Nokia of Fin- land has a 20 per cent stake. In 1990, Ja/Mont had sales of L2,268bn ($1.75bn) and gross operating earnings of L297bn. Ja/Mont, whose corporate headquarters is in Brussels, operates 13 plants throughout Europe. Giuseppe Garofano: wants to focus on other sectors The acquisition represents something of a comeback for Mr Cragnotti, who in his then- role as a senior Montedison and Ferruzzi group executive, was instrumental in construct- ing JalMont. Since leaving Montedison and its parent company after the collapse of the Enimont chemicals joint venture last year, Mr Cragnotti has built up his new investment banking enterprise, which he says will specialise in buying and oper- ating industrial assets, notably in the packaging and deter- gents sectors. In March this year, Cragnotti & Partners spent C$77m to buy control of Lawson Mardon, the international packaging com- pany. Since then, the partner- ship, which is now believed to have virtually reached its L450bn launch capital, has made a number of smaller investments, notably in Brazil. Among the biggest share- holders in Cragnotti & Part- ners are the Ferruzzi group; Swiss Bank Corporation, with a 10 per cent stake; and Credit Lyonnais. The latest transac- tion will add to the credibility of the new partnership. How- ever, Mr Cragnotti still has to show he can conclude a big deal for a company not linked to his former employers. Montedison said the sale was part of the group's strategy of focusing, under its chairman Mr Giuseppe Garofano, on the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, energy and agro-industrial sec- tors. Montedison shares reacted positively to the sale, with a rise to L1,222 after the news. The shares had earlier fallen L11 to L1,189 at the Milan stock market's close yesterday. Montedison said Cragnotti & Partners would pay the sum through the issue of \"negotia- ble and guaranteed\" notes maturing in 1996 and 1998 respectively.",

   "text_content" : "PAIN'S top two retail banks have launched unit trust sales campaigns fol- lowing the government's over- haul this summer of personal income tax guidelines. The campaigns mark a new and potentially damaging phase in the battle for business among Spain's domestic sinan- cial institutions. They also sug- gest that a real savings culture is at last about to take root in Spain. Two years ago, the main weapon in the high street banking battle was high inter- est bearing accounts, and the competition for new deposits weakened the banks' operating margins. The fight to turn depositors into unit trust sav- ers could have an equally dam- aging impact on the perfor- mance of individual banks. A promotional extravaganza launched at the weekend by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest retail bank, showed a hen sitting on two dozen golden eggs and safely protected by glass casing from a predatory fox, every Span- lard's metaphor for the ubiqui- tous taxman. Banco de Santander, the most successful of the big domestic banks, hit back 24 Tom Burns on the battle for investors' business among the country's financial institutions hours later. It termed its unit trust scheme a paraiso fiscal, or tax haven, and marketed a Caribbean island in place of a golden nest egg. The message - escape the inland revenue with a unit trust - is evident enough. The two banks have launched their products in anticipation of new tax procedures - due to come into effect at the begining of 1992 - which no longer add capital gains realised during the fiscal year to personal income earnings. Unit trusts , which will be almost wholly invested in fixed incomes and should yield around 10 per cent, receive a particularly favourable fiscal treatment under the new pro- cedures. Annual withdrawals from a unit trust of under Pta500,000 ($4,716) will be tax exempt and, under a sliding scale that reduces tax on the unit trust gains, all income realised by the investment after 15 years will likewise not be subject to tax. \"Spaniards have finally received a clear incentive to Save,\" said Ms Rosario Martin, president of Gestinova, BBV's asset management subsidiary. BBV introduced unit trusts to selected customers before the summer, when the tax L advantages were announced. It i has seen the volume of its funds grow by 60 per cent. Santander, in a similar three-month exploratory phase, t reports that its funds under management have grown from S$18m to $546m. The target cli- t ent for the unit trusts is the r high interest current account I holder earning as much as 14 per cent before tax on deposits I in excess of $100,000. \"High income current accounts squeezed profits and I forced the banks to be effi- L cdent,\" said Mr Federico Ysart, i a senior Santander executive. \"Unit trusts will benefit the banks that have a high liquid- ity.\"",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan SIDIS, the financial services arm of Italy's Fiat group, raised pre-tax profits by 31 per cent to L257bn ($198.5m) in the first six months of this year. Last year's comparable figure was L206bn. Much of the earnings increase stemmed from capital gains on the group's securities portfolio, where Fidis made profits of L206bn against L134bn in the first half of 1990. The bulk of the gains derived from the sale of the company's 10.86 per cent holding in the Telettra telecommunications group. The sale of Telettra was part of a complex share swap between Fiat and Alcatel Als- thom, the French industrial group, last year. As part of the cross share- holding arrangement, Fidis will eventually hold around 1.6 per cent of the French com- pany's shares, once convertible bonds are exercised. In a move to concentrate the Flat group's activities in sinan- cial services, Fidis has also set up a new subsidiary, Fidisges- tioni, which will hold its 60 per cent stakes in Prime and Augusta, which operate in fund management and insur- ance respectively.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in Wilmington, Delaware THE BATTLE for control of MGM, the once legendary Hol- lywood studio, took a bizarre twist yesterday as Mr Gian- carlo Parretti, the controver- sial Italian financier who con- trolled MGM, made his US courtroom debut and launched a series of attacks on Credit Lyonnais, the French bank that is his biggest backer. The Delaware court case, stemming from a lawsuit by Credit Lyonnais, centres on whether Mr Parretti, who last spring stepped down as MGM chairman, breached a corpo- rate governance agreement he had signed last April. The bank alleges financial mismanagement by Mr Parretti brought MGM to the brink of bankruptcy and that it agreed to lend MGM $145m on condi- tion that he give up control of the studio. During nearly three hours of testimony in a tiny courtroom where lawyers for both sides were outnumbered by the press, Mr Parretti claimed he had been under pressure from Credit Lyonnais executives to sign more than 100 documents giving up control of MGM or face bankruptcy. Mr Parretti, who is appealing a fraud conviction In Naples, claimed Mr Alexis Wolkensteir and Mr Francois Gille, both deputy general managers of Cridit Lyonnais, went to Hol- lywood last April and forced him to sign over control of the studio. \"It was like a machine gun held to my head,\" the stocky Italian financier told the court. Mr Parretti said the French bank had loaned him $400m and had proposed the sale or assets - including the disposal of 40 per cent of the film studio - that could have raised $600m. A lawyer for Credit Lyonnais said in an interview that the banks exposure to Mr Parretti and to companies related to the MIGM deal amounted to more than $ibn. Until a few months ago Crddit Lyonnais had insisted that its exposure to Mr Parretti was less than $300m. Glaucarlo Parretl: claims he resigned under pressure SYesterday's proceedings 3 seemed a comedy of errors at i times as Mr Parretti testified in Italian, but occasionally broke into English to correctthe hap- less interpreter. At one point, Mr Parretti said he had agreed to name Mr Cesare de Michelis as MGM chairman because Mr de Mich- ells - the brother of Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister - was friendly with President George Bush and with Mr SteVe Ross, chairman of Time Warner. Mr Parretti accused Mr Alan Ladd, the Hollywood film maker, now MGM chairman and an ally of Crddit Lyonnais, of not being honest. Mr Ladd, who said MGM could run a negative cash flow of M20m this year, joked dur- ing a break in the proceedings that \"I guess I was corrupted by power\". Mr Parretti, advised by his lawyers not to speak to the press, nonetheless could not resist making his own jokes. '\"This is great. I have no mbre debts. I used to have debts, but soon the bank will be forced to pay me damages,\" he exclaimed . Lawyers from MGM and Credit Lyonnais are expected to contest Mr Parretti's version as the trial continues during the next few days.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harverson THE SCANDAL surrounding the manipulation of US Trea- sury securities auctions by Salomon Brothers could force the country's taxpayers to pay more to finance the govern- ment debt, a Congressional report has concluded. The report, compiled from a study into the cost of Salo- mon's violations by the Con- gressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Con- gress, says that taxpayers may have to pay slightly higher interest costs on future issues of Treasury securities because the integrity of the market has been called into question. The report warned: \"The scandal may inhibit some potential buyers from purchas- ing Treasury securities: [that is] demand will decline, and consequently Treasury securi- ties will sell at lower prices and pay higher interest rates.\" Although the CRS's analysis did not calculate the total financial damage of Salomon's actions, it listed six other groups affected by the firm's misdemeanours. * The scandal has caused sub- stantial losses for Salomon shareholders: since the firm owned up to making illegal bids in Treasury auctions, Salomon's share price has fallen from about $36 to $22%. * Other primary dealers of government securities experi- enced a loss of business and profits because they were unable to purchase newly-is- sued Treasury securities after Salomon attempted to corner the market. * Investing institutions who i did not bid through primary dealers were forced to pay higher prices for their securi- ties because Salomon's tactics i forced interest rates down and I prices up. * Clients of primary dealers, including secondary dealers of i government notes and bonds, I also had to pay more than nec- essary for their securities, and the cost of the more expensive I securities may have been t passed on to the ultimate I investors who bought from sec- ondary dealers. * Short sellers lost money because they had to repur- chase the securities they had promised to sell at unexpect- edly high prices. * Some borrowers with vari- able rate loans linked to inter- est rates on Treasury securities may have paid, and may pay, a higher interest rate on their loans. The ultimate cost of the scandal to Salomon, however, may be greater. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress yesterday that Salomon's sta- tus as a primary dealer remained under review.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's largest com- pany, was unlikely to match its 199091 results in the current year, Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman, said yesterday. BHP reported net profits of A$1.4bn (US$1.12bn) for the year to May 31, after abnormal gains of A$222m. The first- quarter results for the current year, released last week, showed a fall of 42 per cent in net profits after abnormals, to AS232m. Sir Arvi, at the company's annual meeting, said the first- quarter decline was restricted to 18 per cent after excluding the effects of the sale of shares in Woodside Petroleum in the comparable quarter of 1990-91. However, he said the group foresaw little improvement in demand for steel this year, and forecast that petroleum earn- ings would reflect lower aver- age oil prices. Sir Arvi said falling profits from oil and steel would be off- set \"to some extent\" by increased contributions from copper, iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG), and the effects of cost reductions. The group had maintained investment in internationally competitive projects \"through periods of high interest rates and through the gloom of an Australian recession and reduced world activity\", Sir Arvi said. \"As a result, we have a mix of mature businesses, develop- ing businesses and a range of possible investment opportuni- ties which will benefit us as economic conditions improve,\" he said. Sir Arvi said the medium to longer term outlook was \"very Sir Arvi Parbo: stressed need for resources development positive\". However, he said Australia risked allowing oppo- nents of resources develop- ment to threaten economic growth. \"At a time when the world is moving faster and competitive pressures are increasing inter- nationally, negative views about economic development ... have gained extraordinary influence and come to domi- nate public policy. \"We have lost touch with the reality that economic growth is the linchpin of our social well being,\" he said. Sir Arvi's comments were d supported by Mr John Prescott, - BHP's managing director, who i- said the debate over resource c development was being \"hijacked\" by environmental s and Aboriginal rights groups. e Their comments reflect con- - cern among mining companies s about the government's sympa- t thetic treatment of opposition y to important projects by some I- groups. Mr Prescott said there was e no hard evidence that govern- s ment attitudes were changing, 11 in spite of pro-development statements recently by some e federal ministers.",

Pan Am has been oper- ating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bank- ruptcy code since January. The plan envisages a \"reor- ganised\" company which would concentrate on Pan Am's Latin American and Caribbean service, as antici- pated in an August agreement between the airline, its credi- tors..and Delta. Delta would.. hold 45 per cent, while Pan Am creditors would own the remaining equity.

United Airlines is linking with McDonalds, the world's largest fast-food chain, to pro- vide children's meals on its services to and from Orlando in Florida.

   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan ACTIVITY in the Eurobont- market yesterday was concen- trated in three sectors - US dollar, yen and Canadian dol- lar - currently enjoying a bull run. The strength of demand for three new issues by the World Bank, Belgium and Canadian National Railways exceeded the supply of paper, dealers said. INTERNATIONAL BONDS The Kingdom of Belgium's $600m issue, increased from $500m, was considered cor- rectly priced at 44 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury, and sold out quickly. Even in a rising market, the deal tightened by one basis point. The issue was enhanced by a lack of supply at the 10- year area of the yield curve, where much existing paper is now trading at a premium to its issue price. The competition for the man- date was won by Swiss Bank Corporation, although other banks are said to have priced the deal at a lower spread. However, SBC was able to offer better terms on the accompa- nying swap into fixed-rate Swiss francs. Despite firm demand, poor swap opportunities into float- ing-rate dollars - the target for many companies - are likely to scupper plans by bor- rowers based on the London interbank offered rate to tap the market. In the yen sector, the World Bank tapped the five-year area of the yield curve, providing a much-needed new benchmark. The Y75bn deal is now the largest five-year deal in the sector. With many European accounts still underweight in yen, and a lack of liquid Euro- yen bonds, demand for the deal was enthusiastic. An official discount rate cut is expected soon, and the benchmark No 129 Japanese government bond yesterday fell below 6 per cent for the first time since 1990, underlin- ing bullish sentiment. The World Bank issue was bid at 99.98, above its fixed reoffer price of 99.80. But the supply of new issues in yen is also likely to be inhib- ited by the lack of swap oppor- tunities. The World Bank deal was unswapped. The pricing of the deal was \"right on the market\", one dealer said. But demand proved overwhelming. \"Every institution that ever bought a Euroyen bond seemed to be after this one,\" one trader claimed. Elsewhere, Canadian National Railways tapped the Canadian dollar sector of the Eurobond market for the first time in four years. The C$150m deal met strong demand from retail and institu- tional investors, to close at 100 bid, above its re-offered price of 99.80. Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, returned to the Euro- bond market with an Ecu5Om deal. The issue followed a $200m deal by Telebras, Brazil's tele- communications monopoly, brought to the market on Mon- day. NWW INTERNATIONAL BOND ISSUS Umewerw Amount m. Coupon % Pre.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb US COMPANIES with strong European or worldwide operations could provide a source of international equity business. One such company which intends to float its interna- tional operations is Waste Management, one of the big- gest US waste handling compa- nies. It is planning an initial pub- lic offering for its international subsidiary, with a listing in London, due to take place in mid-1992. The parent company, which has a turnover of about $7.5bn - $lbn from the inter- national operations - will keep a controlling stake in the subsidiary. Corporate advisers hope other US companies may con- sider a similar strategy: Gold- man Sachs is advising one about the potential spin-off of its European operations, and others may follow suit if mar- ket conditions are favourable. US companies such as Avon Products, Levi Strauss and PepsiCo have made initial pub- lic offerings (IPOs) of their Jap- anese subsidiaries. Advisers say that many US companies, for example in the motor, infor- mation technology, food, chem- icals, pharmaceuticals and con- sumer products sectors, have built substantial European or international operations that would be suitable to be spun off. But when the price/earnings ratio in the US market is higher than in many European markets, does it make sense financially for a US company to float off its European operations in Europe? One adviser claims that in general, US companies would be able to raise more money by INTERNATIONAL EQUITY ISSUES floating a subsidiary in the US than in the UK. An investment house, however, says that in some sectors, a higher valua- tion can be achieved in Europe than in the US. \"The question a US company must ask is: why float a subsid- iary in a market with a low p/e ratio?\" says one corporate adviser. There would have to be other advantages in floating a subsidiary for it to be attrac- tive in present market condi- tions. For example, an IPO for a European/international subsid- iary can: * Provide an opportunity to attract new European inves- tors. \"In cases where the US parent company is heavily indebted, it can be an advan- tage to tap European investors when US investors are tired of being called upon,\" says one adviser. * Enable the company to be self-financing. Mr Jim Koenig, chief financial officer of Waste Management, says the planned IPO will \"give us the ability to finance the growth of the inter- national operations and to finance in the markets where we are investing\". However, some highly- geared companies may face problems in spinning off sub- sidiaries because their bond or credit covenants may prevent them selling assets. Such com- panies would need to alter their debt covenants. There is also a risk that floating subsidiaries could eventually detract from the parent company. \"The question is, if the Euro- pean subsidiary were to do things in the European growth markets, would it be paid for by some detriment to the US equity value or would it be taken into account in the value of the US equity?\" points out an adviser. LVMH ISSUE GIVES INVESTORS GAIN OVER EQUITY PERFORMANCE LVMH, the French drinks and luxury goods group, launched a FFrSOOm four-year hybrid convertible issue yesterday. The issue allows investors to gear up on the performance of the underlying equity, receiving 1.25 times the gain made by the stock. However, the potential gain is capped at 180 per cent of par by the end of the fourth year. There is also no coupon on theissue. Investors cannot convert directly into the underlying equity, but will be paid the cash equivalent of the price of the shares. One of the securities houses involved in the deal claims that the total return on the convertible issue is guaranteed to exceed that on the underlying equity if growth in the stock is between 8 per cent and 15 per cent a year - or \"moderate to high\" - over the four-year period. SociWtd Gendrale is lead manager for the issue.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London LAND SECURITIES, the UK property group, yeterday launched a Â£200m l ated debenture issue, the proceeds of which will be used to .nance property acquisitions. The deal as a 86-year matu- rity, among the longest-dated debenture Issues in the mar- ket. The long maturity was chosen to meet specific demand from UK pension fund and Insurance company fund managers, which hold long- dated assets to match liabill- ties. The deal was priced to yield 110 basis points more than the UK government's 9 per cent bonds maturing 2008, the long- dated government benchmark The pricing was described as fair by prtipants, and the bonds sold well to UK Institu- tional investors. The deal, arranged by J. Henry Schroder Wagg, traded up from an issue price of 96.118 to stand at 96.25 bid by late afternoon. Land Securities is regarded as obe of the strongest quoted UK property companies. It has outstanding debenture issues maturing in 2025 and 2030. Yesterday's deal was priced to yield around 8 basis points more than that available on these shorter-dated bonds in the secondary market. The company said the pro- ceeds of the issue would be used to make acquisitions while property prices were at the bottom of the cycle. Demand for long-dated ster- ling bonds has been buoyant, but supply of new paper has not kept pace. Analysts said the last long- dated debenture issue of com- parable quality was Whit- bread's Â£135m Issue maturing 2011, launched last December.",

   "text_content" : "I By Sara Webb in London and Patrick Harverson in New York JAPANESE government bonds rose to highs on hopes of lower interest rates and the strength of the yen. Both the cash and futures markets reached their highest levels since January 1990, with the yield on the benchmark No 129 bond breaking through 6 per cent. The strongest rise was seen at the long end of the market, traders said. Yesterday's announcement that the Big Four securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Â£1.5bn of 9% per cent conver- sion stock due 2004, where demand was expected to be reasonable. SGERMAN government bonds edged up, helped by encourag- ing inflation data from two west German states. The government called for tenders on its latest Treasury bills to be sold today at auc- tion. The bills have a coupon of 8% per cent and a maturity of just more than four years. Traders said market partici- pants had hoped for a five-year issue which would provide bet- ter arbitrage opportunities with the new futures contract, due to be launched in October. *US TREASURY prices rose, fell and then recovered yester- day as dealers manoeuvred their positions before and after a big auction of two-year notes. In late trading, the bench- mark 30-year issue had reversed its early gains and was down A at 1021, yielding 7.875 per cent. The two-year note, however, was up i at 100&, to yield 6.112 per cent. Prices had opened firmer in expectation of a successful sale of $13bn in two-year notes. However, with dealers pre- paring for the afternoon auc- tion, selling sent the market into retreat, which was exacer- bated by some unexpectedly healthy vehicle sales data. When the auction passed uneventfully, prices rallied slightly.",

The 10-year government bond auction scheduled for today has been postponed for a few days, traders said, adding that foreign and smaller bro- kers would probably take the opportunity to increase market share in the absence of the Big Four. * THE UK government's poor performance in an opinion poll yesterday pushed gilt prices slightly down in a dull market.

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hargreaves In Geneva MINIS'TERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were last night close .to agreeing an increase in fourth quarter oil production to between 23.65m and 24m barrels a day in a meeting that could end today. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister met Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, his Ira- nian counterpart after yester- day's meeting to convince him of the need to raise output. The kingdom is looking to secure for itself a production level of 8.5mn b/d. Mr Nazer emphatically stated that Saudi Arabia would produce at that level, putting him into conflict with other smaller producers that eventu- ally want the kingdom to cut back closer to its quota of 5.4m b/d. Saudi Arabia is likely to resist any cutback in its output even to accommodate the return of Iraq and Kuwait to the market next year. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with an increase in production for the fourth quar- ter,\" Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said. But Mr Aminu said he was unsure how a rise in output would be managed since some Iraqi oil could be returning to the mar- ket. Iraq indicated on Monday that, i it accepts the plan put forward by the United Nations to sell $1.6bn-worth of oil, it will be looking to pump as much as possible in a short time rather than spreading exports out over six months. This could see a return of Im b/d of Iraqi oil to the export market in the fourth quarter, which would absorb much of an expected rise in demand. However, the agreed produc- tion ceiling is largely irrele- vant since most countries are producing at capacity and are likely to continue to do so. Opec output is running at 23.6m b/d - well above the 22.3m b/d ceiling which was set at the last meeting. One Opec delegate said that the ceiling would be fixed in the interests of long-term disci- pline within the organisation. \"We don't want to signal a free-for-all, he observed.\" A meeting of delegates decided on Monday that the call on Opec oil in the fourth quarter - including drawings from producers' stocks - would be 23.9m b/d, paving the way for a rise in the ceiling. But smaller producers such as Algeria and Libya want to keep output at its current level to give a boost to prices. Saudi Arabia Inksts the mar- ket needs higher output now. \"There will be no spare capac- ity in the market in the rst quarter of next year for the first time since the early 1970s,\" one official said. He forecast the call on Opec oil in the first quarter at more than 25m b/d. That would allow no slack in the market to cover unforseen eventualities. Many delegates believe there will be a return of the Opec production quota system next year to make room in the mar- ket for Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. But Saudi Arabia is pushing for production to be distributed by a totally different mecha- nism. This will link output much more closely to produc- tion capacity than previously. \"Saudi Arabia will not produce less than 8m to 10.5m b/d for the next five years,\" one offi- cial said. * UK North Sea oil produc- tion growth slowed last month as a result of the Fulmar field explosion, but the underlying upward trend remained strong, say Royal Bank of Scotland economists. Output rose by 187,000 b/d to 1.89m b/d.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney THE VALUE of Australia's commodity exports will fall by 2 per cent this year to AS40.8bn (Â£19bn), the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (Abare) said in its latest quarterly report yester- day. The forecast contrasts with average growth rates of 13 per cent in the past four years. It would be the first fall in the value of commodity exports since 1980-81. Mr Brian Fisher, Abare's executive director, said an increase in the volume of farm exports was expected to main- tain their value at about A$14.1bn in spite of falling world prices. Falls in the export earnings of sugar, wheat, barley, dairy products and beef will be offset by rises in earnings for cotton, wool, grapes and wine, Mr Fisher said. However, net farm cash incomes, which take input prices into account, are fore- cast to fall by 24 per cent, fol- lowing a 35 per cent fall in the last financial year. The net value of farm production, which includes depreciation costs, is forecast to fall by 74 per cent, following a drop of similar magnitude last year. Australia Changes in commodity export earnings (%) 20 -5 -10 Soure:Ab.m The falls in farm income will worsen the recession which has hit Australia's rural com- munities in the last two years, mostly as a result of weak world prices for a wide range of farm products. Abare said average prices received by farmers were expected to fall by 5 per cent this year, follow- ing a decline of 13 per cent last year. Mineral exports are expected to fall by 2 per cent to A$26.8bn, largely because of a 7 per cent cut in the value of energy exports to A$9.3bn, fol- lowing a 26 per cent increase in 1990-91. Abare said crude oil earn- ings would fall 46 per cent to A$1.lbn because of lower prices and volumes, while earnings from liquefied petro- leum gas and other petroleum products would also fall because of weaker prices. This will more than offset the mod- erate growth expected in earn- ings from liquefied natural gas and coal exports, largely reflecting increased volumes, Abare said. The value of other mineral exports is forecast to grow by 1 per cent to A$17.4bn. However, while the value of iron ore and nickel exports is expected to grow strongly, gold exports are forecast to grow only moder- ately in value, and alumina (aluminium oxide), aluminium, zinc and copper exports are all forecast to fall. Abare also said its index of mine production was forecast to grow by 1 per cent this year, following a 2 per cent increase last year. The slowdown con- trasts strongly with the rapid growth of the late 1980s.",

Coffee prices closed ahead in London and were ahead in New York at midday on forecasts of continued dry weather in Brazil's growing areas for the next few days. Mounting political unrest in Zaire and talk that shipments could be disrupted for several months helped to support the London market.

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers and the European Commission both claimed last night that signifl- cant progress had been made in agreeing on the reform of the creaking Common Agricul- tural Policy. Mr Piet Bukman, the Dutch president of the Council of Ministers, said after a two-day meeting there was now \"una- nimity that fundamental reform is necessary.\" Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, said: \"The broad thrust of the commis- sion's approach is accepted, and now we have to argue about the detail\". The Irish commissioner went further to claim that the Coun- cil was already in a position to agree on certain of his radical reform proposals, such as those for sheepmeat, early retire- ment for farmers, environmen- tal measures and reafforesta- tion. Mr Bukman broadly concurred. However, what Mr Mac- Sharry called \"a realistic approach to the debate\" did not prevent ministers from presenting national shopping lists of concessions they expect in exchange for going along - for the moment - with the Brussels plan. The UK, for example, still regards the limit on compensa- tion to sheep farmers as dis- criminatory, since 14 per cent of British herds are above the threshold size at which premi- ums cease, against an average 3 per cent across the EC. Mr John Gummer, the UK agricul- ture minister, also wants mem- ber states to be able to decide how their farmers take land out of production, within com- pulsory national quotas set by Brussels. Under the commis- sion's plan, he and his French colleague Mr Louis Mermaz maintain, it is the big cereals farmers with economies of scale who will be worst hit by \"set aside\" provisions, costed in a way which makes them almost mandatory. Several ministers, led by Mr Mermaz, argued that the cuts planned for cereals, of 35 per cent over three years, went too far too fast. Mr MacSharry emphasised that there would be full compensation for these draconian price reductions and that ministers were only emphasising the cuts. The debate coincided with the commission releasing a new study on the effects of the reform, by the University of Bonn. Though less optimistic than previous Brussels esti- mates, the study shows that real net value added to farming would be 3 per cent higher with the planned reform than without it."

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington LEGISLATION introduced in the US House of Representa- tives by a key member of the House Agriculture Committee would provide immediate food assistance to the Soviet Union and the republics and long term technical assistance from US farmers and agribusiness companies. Mr Tom Coleman, the high- est ranking Republican on the committee, yesterday warned that \"empty stomachs make for desperate people who may embrace any despot who can promise them food\". He and other members urged that the US Department of Agriculture should take swift action to expedite a carefully targeted flow of aid to the Soviet Union. Some suggested the that USDA or other US government employees should be staoned on the ground in the Soviet republics to super- vise the flow of aid. Mr Coleman's Support For Emerging Democracies Act of 1991 would use as a vehicle for the assistance the Food for Progress programme. Tt is a scheme that author- ises the US agriculture secre- tary toprovide overseas aid from US surplus stocks or to purchase commodities on the openmarket without getting budgetary authorisation from Congress. The Act would remove for the 1992 fiscal year the r30m ceiling on the funds available to pay the pro- gramme's costs. It lifts for one year the ceil- ing of 500,000 tonnes of com- modities for use in the pro- gramme, and it would temporarily suspend the \"cred- it-worthiness\" test the USDA is required to use before granting export guarantees. Mr Chris Goldthwait, a USDA official who recently returned from the Soviet Union, said there was no immi- nent danger of widespread fam- ine. However, republics at the end of the food distribution chain are vulnerable. The USDA is developing a food assistance plan likely to cover the supply of grain rather than processed commodities. Mr Timothy Penny, another member of the congressional agriculture committee, released a telex received from Mr Alexander Krivenko, presi- dent of the Soviet trading com- pany, Prodintorg, which requested supplies of meat, poultry, dairy products, fats and oils, baby foods and tallow He urged President Bush to make the US food credit guar- antee programme more attrac- tive to commercial banks.",

   "text_content" : "I Finance problems are clogging the pipepline, writes Barbara Durr OR THE grain trade, deciphering Washing- ton's signals on agricul- tural aid to the Soviet Union has lately been more difficult than usual. Despite increas- ingly urgent pleas for ever larger amounts of aid Washing- ton is still wrestling with how to respond. The problem lies mainly in the reluctance of commercial banks to finance the Soviet purchases despite US Depart- ment of Agriculture credit guarantees for 98 per cent of the principle and 4.5 per cent of the the interest. The cover has simply not overcome bankers' fears about the Soviet government's credit-worthi- ness. The banks have thus frustrated the Bush adminis- tration's August offer to the Soviets of an immediate $315m in credit guarantees. So far, only $116m of that sum has been used, according to USDA. Yet, the political resolve for unclogging the pipeline seems to exist. One top USDA offi- cials said: \"Obviously, there's a problem. But we are trying to find a solution\". The first, though not neces- sarily the most likely, option under consideration is to soften the terms of the credits for commercial banks. The USDA has authorisation to guarantee up to 100 per cent of the principle and interest equivalent to that payable on 52-week Treasury bills, which at present carry an average rate of 5.57 per cent. Banks have been especially cautious about the interest rate exposure they could incur on the Soviet credits. A cover of as much as 5.57 per cent could be persuasive for some. The additional sweetener of cover on 100 per cent of the principle could lure others. The administration could create problems for itself, how- ever, by changing the terms of the credit guarantees for the Soviets. These could be the first in a long series of such guarantees and a precedent that lets the banks off the hook for virtually all risk may not be considered the best course of action. Other countries could demand similar terms, further undermining the shared risk concept on which the guarantee programme was built. The administration's other main option is to offer direct government credits. These have not been offered by the USDA since 1984, officials said, but given the potential nega- tives associated with softening the terms for the banks, they could be seen as a less unat- tractive choice. Moreover, according to those in Congress with their eye on the US budget, direct credits would cost the US government only marginally more than the guarantees. Various pro- grammes of humanitarian or concessionary food aid are also being considered, though the restrictions on these limit their potential effectiveness, given the massive size of Soviet needs. The PL480 concessionary food sales programme, for example, has an annual budget of only $1.5bn and has traditionally been used for developing countries. While it could have some role to play in an emergency food supply effort, the programme is too small to be suitable for the Soviet Union and expanding it would run up against US budgetary limits on foreign aid. Thus, under PL480's current restrictions, Congress is unlikely to countenance taking food from people in such a des- perate situtaion as the Ethio- pians. The Bush adminstration is expected to make a decision within the next week or so on how to expedite its agricultural credits for the Soviets. Included in the package will be the remaining $199m of the $315m made available last month and the $585m that was pledged for the period between October and February, during the new US fiscal year that starts October 1. These two amounts were originally part of a US pledge earlier this year of $900m worth of credits for 1992. These were to be available in two tranches, $500m in October and $400m in February. But, after the failure of the Soviet coup, Mr Bush accelerated $315m worth of the package. The US had already extended $1.6bn worth of credit guarantees dur- ing the US fiscal year of 1991. Whether the US will offer additional credits is unclear, though members of Congress and the grain producers lob- bies are urging the administra- tion to do so. Members of Con- gress have talked about another $lbn, while the North American Export Grain Associ- ation has asked for not less than $2bn and the US Feed Grains Council has suggested that allocations for the Soviets and former Soviet republics should be approximately $3bn. But in Chicago's grain mar- ket there is little talk of fresh credits and much scepticism about the Soviet need for and ability to absorb the vast quan- tities of food they have recently estimated they will require. Mr Steven Bruce, a grain analyst with Geldermann, said that without clear signals from Washington the market has been and will continue to be quiet. \"We believe it's going to be a go-slow programme with the Soviets,\" he said.",

   "article_dc_title" : "US Consumer Data Hits Dollar",
   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR was lower ] yesterday after recent concerns i that the US economy is making only a weak recovery from 1 recession were supported by 1 official data indicating a larger 1 fall in consumer confidence than expected. 1 The 3.5 percentage point fall in the consumer confidence index in September to 72.7 took I the market by surprise. Only < last week the University of 1 Michigan said confidence had risen this month. This had led 1 analysts to expect the Confer- 1 ence Board's consumer confi- i dence index to rise to 77.0. But there was little selling 1 pressure behind the dollar's \\ decline and after London 1 closed, the US currency rebounded. The next major test for the I dollar is not likely to come I until the September employ- 1 ment report, released on Octo- ( ber 4. Analysts are expecting a 1 rise in the unemployment rate and little change in non-farm payroll employment. Today sees the release of August durable goods figures. A decline of 4.5 per cent is expected after July's 11.2 per cent increase. However, the durable goods report is unlikely to have a major impact on the dollar as it is widely regarded as an erratic series.

The dollar closed lower at DM1.6685 from DM1.6725; at SFrl.4510 from SFrl.4590; at Y132.85 from Y133.30; and at FFr5.6800 from FFr5.6975. The dollar's index closed unchanged at 64.5. As the end of the Japanese fiscal half year approaches, banks and other investment institutions have begun to buy yen as profits are repatriated home. This supported the yen, which rose against most cur- rencies. The D-Mark slipped to Y79.19-29 from Y79.59. The Swiss franc continued to be supported by the country's high interest rates. Swiss call money rose to just over 8 per cent, up % point, prompting the D-Mark to fall to 8686-98 Swiss centimes from 87.07-18. Within the European exchange rate mechamism, the D-Mark was steady as high German interest rates also -unerpined currency daling. But signs that inflationary pressures may be easing sup. ported the credit markets and egan to take some of steam out of the mark. Indications from the Spanish finance minister, Mr Carlos Colchaga, that interest rates may fall to offset the tight 1992 budget led to further selling of the pesata. The D-Mark closed at Pta6S.14-16 from Pta 62.9906. Sterling was slightly weaker after an opinion poll put the Labour party ahead of the rul- ing Conservative party. It was lower at DM2.9125 from DM2.9150; at SFr2.535 from SFr2.5450; at Y231.75 from Y232.00; and at FFr9.9125 from FFr9.9875; but it rose to $1.7450 from $1.7440.

But turnover was low with few fresh factors to influence dealing. The Â£L5bn gilt auction today helped prevent rates slip- ping far, although being a partly paid issue it is unlikely to drain much liquidity. The lastest opinion poll, which put the Labour party slightly ahead, caused early weakness in sterling and the UK dwfel bm* bus lugs rob \"eM Seplmber 4 futures market, and helped to underpin rates. The actions of the Bank of England also proved support after it left the market slOom short in its daily open market operations. The Bank purchased Â£850m of bills agairst an estimated shortage All the Bank's bill pmrchaes were in bands 1 and 2 at unchanged rates of 10% per cent.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street After a lacklustre first half in the .wake of a weak consumer confidence report, share prices recovered well on a round of late buying to end higher, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.56 at 3,029.07, having spent the first four hours of the ses- sion in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 moved in a similar fashion, ending up 1.79 at 387.71, while the Nasdaq com- posite of over-the-counter stocks rallied strongly to end up 1.78 at 526.47. Turnover on the New York SE was 171m shares. Market sentiment remained shaky all day in spite of the late rally, with some investors placing their hopes in another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, but others more con- cerned about the feeble state of the economy. The report of a decline in the Conference Board consumer confidence index for September under- lined the fact that Americans have yet to respond to the putative economic recovery with a significant shift in expectations or spending. US West featured with a decline of $2% to $35% on vol- ume of more than 1m shares. The regional telecommunica- tions group warned that sec- ond half earnings would be lower than last year. Elsewhere in the telecoms sector, Metro Mobile, the cellu- lar phone system operator, jumped $1% to $21 after it agreed to a $1.65bn bid from Bell Atlantic, which also agreed to assume $800m of Metro debts. Bell Atlantic fell $1% to $46. AT&T slipped $/% to $38% in active trading as the company announced it was introducing cordless telephone products for small businesses. General Dynamics climbed $4 to $45%. The opening of trading in the stock was delayed by an order imbalance on the buy side. The stock was in demand after it was reported that PaineWebber, the broking house, had made posi- tive comments about the com- pany and that another broker, Goldman Sachs, had raised its profits forecast. Under a new agreement Computer Sciences Corpora- tion has agreed to pay General Dynamics $200m for facilities, equipment, software and ser- vices in a 10-year link up between the two, and some analysts believe that the defence contractor may use that money to buy back some of its own stock. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, Compression Laboratories climbed $2'/ to $21% on the news that US Sprints newly formed videoconferencing unit will re-sell products supplied by Compression. Biotechnology stocks rode a rollercoaster ride. Amgen fell $1 to $55%, Chiron dropped sharply but recovered late on to end $% to $68%, Centocor gave up $% to $51'%/ while Somatogen rallied from a morning loss to finish $2'%/ higher at $36%. Some investors have been shifting funds out of the sector in recent days on the advice of brokers, who believe biotech- nology issues may have been overbought. Advanced Telecommunica- tions fell $% to $16% after the company warned that earnings for the second quarter, ending September 30, would be 10 cents to 15 cents a share below the 33 cents a share earned at the same stage a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks ended flat in another in a long series of moderate trading sessions. Based on preliminary data, the composite index was up 1.49 to 3,398.10 and declining issues led advances by 302 to 234. Volume of 23.5m shares was above the previous 19.9m and trading value was C$286.1m against C$222.7m. Magna International, up C$1% to C$14%, reported fourth-quarter net income of C$11.6m against a year-earlier loss of C$21.4m., which included a sizable charge.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo LOWER INTEREST rates and expectations that more cuts are on the way boosted share prices yesterday, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 140.96 to end at 23,333.70, recouping Friday's loss. The stock market was closed on Monday. The market barome- ter reached a day's high of 23,462.29 and a low of 23,182.86. Advances led declines by 577 to 425, with 157 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares gained 9.60 to 1,797.62, although the second section declined 5.73 to 2,786.30. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 7.75 to 1,380.12. First section volume was dull at 320m shares, down from 600m, reflecting a reluctance among Japanese institutions to trade prior to company book closings for the first half of the fiscal year at the end of this month. Likewise, overseas investors were relatively quiet. \"Most of the activity was futures-linked or index-re- lated,\" said Ms Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. \"Foreigners have pretty much done what they want and are happy to sit back and wait,\" she added. The market received support in the morning from comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, that he expects short and long-term bank prime rates to decline further. Mr Mieno's remarks, along with the rise in the yen to a seven-month high, pushed the yield on 10-year govern- ment bonds below the key 6.0 per cent mark and encouraged further stock buying. The Nik- kei December futures contract also posted a strong gain. Speculative issues that had gained sharply in recent ses- sions suffered some heavy losses, including Nippon Car- bon, which dropped Y290 to Y1,740, while Honshu Paper fell Y53 to Y807 and Clarion shed Y80 to Y1,220. Shipbuilders continued to rise on an improving operating climate, with Hitachi Zosen gaining Y17 to Y697 and Mitsui Shipbuilding adding Y15 at Y630. Tokimec, Japan's leading maker of marine instruments, remained strong, advancing Y36 to Y959. Food issues were favoured as a defensive play, with Nisshin Flour Milling climbing Y60 to a year's high of Y1,540. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 51.00 to 25,728.56. Vol- ume was low at 83.7m shares. Roundup INTEREST RATE movements also affected trading in the Pacific Rim yesterday. TAIWAN anticipated inter- est rate cuts by the leading commercial banks, announced after the close. The weighted index added 72.74 or 1.5 per cent to end at 4,814.19, follow- ing a gain of 88.18 on Saturday. The market was closed on Monday. Turnover increased to T$24bn from T$22bn. MANILA accelerated Mon- day's recovery as debate ebbed over the withdrawal of US troops, and bargain hunters moved in. The composite index climbed 53.84 or 5.9 per cent to 966.59. A reported meeting between a senior Congress fig- ure and a rebel army officer on Monday also provided a boost. PLDT rose 27.50 pesos to 545, while another blue chip, Philip- pine National Bank, was up 15 at 275. Turnover fell from 124.5m pesos to 107.5m. SEOUL lost ground on fears that the government's tight money supply policy would drive up local interest rates. The composite index closed at 683.93, down 5.11, after turn- over of Won106.8bn, against Friday's Won155bn. The Kor- ean market was also closed on Monday. KUALA LUMPUR was sup- ported by institutional buying of Telekom Malaysia. The com- posite index edged up 0.46 to 521.03 as Telekom moved up 15 cents to M$10 with 1.17m shares traded. Market turnover rose to M$57m from M$53m. BANGKOK's SET index slipped through the 700 level, ending 9.60 lower at 695.24 on thin turnover of Btl.96bn. HONG KONG limped through an extremely quiet day to leave the Hang Seng index off 6.15 at 3,904.19, in HK*719m turnover, the lowest since June. NEW ZEALAND lacked buy- ing interest. Heavy selling of a few leading issues by Welling- ton houses pulled the NZSE-40 index down 4.88 to 1,373.97. A bullish local dollar and lacklus- tre performances on offshore markets sapped investor confi- dence in AUSTRALIA. The All Ordinaries index lost 7.4 at 1,555.5 in turnover of A$149m.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Damian Fraser in Mexico City FOREIGN investment in Mexican stocks reached a record $13.6bn In August, com- pared with Just $4bn at the end of January, reflecting the continued confidence in Mexico's economy and the stock market's 114 per cent rise since the start of the year. Investment in New York- listed American depository shares (ADSs) amounted to $9.8bn at the end of August, of which $8.9bn was invested in Telmex, the telephone monop- oly which made a $2bn inter- national share offering last May. At the end of January, investment in ADSs was $2bn. Another $1.95bn was invested in \"free\" shares (those open to foreigners), compared with $lbn at the end of January, while $1.34bn was invested in the Nafin trust, which invests in shares not directly open to foreigners, against $680m at the end of January. Foreign investment is likely to increase in the coming months as Mexican companies take advantage of the favoura- ble climate to issue stock. In the next two weeks Grupo Carso, which controls Telmex, hopes to issue $250m of ADS stock, Mexico's second-largest stock offering after Telmex. Televisa, the television com- pany, is expected to make an initial public offering of $400m to $500m by the end of the year. According to the state- run news agency Notimex, another nine companies will soon make international stock offerings. These include conglomerates such as Sidek, expected to make an offering of $80m to $100m; Grupo Desc, of $200m; Alfa, of $50m to $150m; and Vitro, Mexico's largest con- glomerate, of $200m. SOUTH AFRICA GOLD SHARES were boosted by a rally in bullion prices, rising silver prices and a weak dollar. The all-gold index rose 25 or 2.2 per cent to 1,154 while the industrial index slipped 21 to 4,150, leaving the overall index 4 higher at 3,406.",

   "text_content" : "The industry lacks obvious attractions, but it is certainly eventful, writes Peter John I f rPiAN tyre eomp nies are comparable t\" steam trains. They ar large, cumbersome and oin.- dent, with very little going for them at the moment. But everyone seems to like them. The reaction to yesterdays interim results from Michelin, in France, is a case in point The company is saddled with heavy debt, which with the cost of redundancies pushed its 1991 first-half net attributable loss to FFrl.06bn. Neverthe- less, the figures were better than feared and the shares touched a 1991 intraday high of FFri31.5 yesterday. Continental, of Germany, may have drifted off a little, but it was the best performing stock in Frankfurt in August. Pirelli SpA, said to be prepar- ing a merger with Conti, brought summer sunshine to a bleak Milan market, while Pirelli Tyre Holding, its Dutch quoted subsidiary, was firm. The industry pick-up started a year ago, but received a healthy boost in mid-August when the big players increased the price of their replacement tyres. Pirelli and Conti are fur- ther buoyed by hopes of a merger, which were sparked by initial proposals made at the d of last year by Pirelli SpA. AlltUree companies have been lifted by'continuing hope- of a turning point in the Euro pean recession and they cer- tainly have ground to recover. conti's share price is languish- ing around the. low DM220 ($126) level, against the mid- DM300S in 1987. Pirelli Tyre Holding, which most closely represents the for- tunes of the Italian group's tyre operations, has fallen from F1 55 ($28) since it was first quoted in Amsterdam in July 1989. Michelin may be above the depreciatory FFr50 ($8.47) of last year, but is still a long way below the FFr380 it com- manded in early 1987. S everal analysts remain 1baffled by the relative popularity of the French group's shares. One said: \"If Michelin was the last share or earth, people would buy it because they need to buy something, but otherwise there are many more attractive shares around.\" Indeed, James Share prices Index (rebased) 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 Jan IadI sep souc Datmnmwn P 1 Capel has placed the company on its list of \"least favoured shares\" in this month's auto- motive review. However, Mr Keith Hayes of Paribas Capital Markets takes a more sanguine view. \"Despite all of its problems, Michelin is still the world's number one and also a classic recovery play. It cannot be dis- missed.\" Pirelli NV is another mys- tery. It concentrates on the premium end of the car market and has therefore been hit par- ticularly severely by recession. It has also suffered aggressive competition from Michelin, and shares the common problem of restructuring costs. Yesterday both Pirelli NV and Pirelli SpA forecast significant losses for the full year in 1991. However, both in the Netherlands and in Italy, their shares have been strong performers. Conti, which initially rejected Pirelli's advances but now appears more amenable Sfollowng the departure of its iforer management board cthairan Mr Horst Urban ist May, has drifted off slightly this month. Although it announced a half-year profit in A'gust, it has signalled a loss for the full year. he question mark hang- ing over the results of all three companies is the extent of restructuring costs they will announce. How- ever, the prospects for fuiture growth depend on external sac- tors - the easing of recession, an improvement in trading margins and more advanta- geous commodity prices. \"Whether they are emerging will depend on the state of the original equipment market next year and whether the price increase in the replace- ment market sticks,\" says Mr Hayes. After a difficult period, the European tyre industry appears to be back on track. Mr Philip Ayton of BZW says: \"The price of raw materials is going in their favour and they are making a concentrated effort to get back in the black.\"",

   "text_content" : "THERE WAS a revival of interest in Germany yesterday, as most other bourses were weak or little changed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw Mannes- mann end DM10 higher at DM268.70 in a late rally, after the EC approved its acquisition of a majority of Boge, the shock absorber manufacturer, and on news that the German telephone authority had backed down in a fight about fees to be charged for mobile telephone systems. The DAX index ended 12.47 higher at 1,626.63 after a rise of only 1.25 to 668.68 in the FAZ at midsession. Other steels showed good rises, extending their relative strength of the past two weeks. The industry association, BDS, said this week that demand for steel in Germany is expected to increase by 2 per cent both this year and next. Volume grew from DM2.9bn to DM4.1bn. Utilities, which were the strongest sector last week according to Merck PT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Sep 24 Hourly changes Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1pm 2 pm 3 pm Clom 1109.49 1109.80 1109.35 1109.87 1110.77 1111.55 1111.68 1110.65 Day's High 1112.16 Day's Low 1108.33 Sep 23 Sep 20 Sep 19 Sep 18 Sep 17 1111.18 1114.51 1113.95 1111.91 1115.57 Bau value 1000 (26101W0). Finck, also extended their gains, RWE leading with a rise of DM5 to DM387. PARIS ended slightly lower after 1991 highs in six of the previous seven sessions. The CAC 40 index recovered from a day's low of 1,877.52, to close 3.12 down at 1,885.23. Turnover was moderate at about FFrl.8bn, up from FFrl.5bn. The best performance was by Sefimeg, a property leasing company, which jumped FFr29.50 or 6.7 per cent to FFr469.50 in heavy volume of 299,000 shares. There was spec- ulation in the market that one of Sefimeg's leading sharehold- ers was increasing its stake, r although one analyst also pointed out that the shares were not expensive on a funda- r mental basis. Even after yes- terday's rise, they were still trading at a substantial dis- i count to the net asset value of . about FFr700. r Saint-Gobain, the glass- t maker, fell FFrl2.10 to FFr480.50, following its / strength in recent weeks. The I share price has outperformed I the market by 10 per cent in ) the past three months. f Michelin finished 10 cen- :- times lower at FFr128 after e announcing a first-half loss in line with expectations. The , shares moved between a year's high of FFr131.50 and FFrl26.10. Volume was strong at 514,000 shares. MILAN was supported by Montedison, which rose 3 per cent on the $827m sale of its stake in the Ja/Mont paper venture. The Comit index eased 0.86 to 543.34 in turnover near Tuesday's thin L71bn. Montedison was officially fixed L11 lower at L1,189, but rose to L1,225 later in the day. Ferruzzi Finanziaria also bene- sited from Montedison's news, rising L9 to L1,961. The tyre and cable maker, Pirelli, eased L18 to L1,910 before announcing that it expected a significant loss for the full year. BRUSSELS was depressed by selling by small investors and corporate results. The Bel20 index shed 10.22 or 0.9 per cent to 1,095.30 in active trading of BFr699m. Soci6t Gdn6rale de Belgique fell BFr50 to BFr2,195 after disappointing results from subsidiary companies, including Gechem, which saw its ordinary shares lose BFr1O il i* I to BFr596. AMSTERDAM gave up small early gains to dose mixed as Wall Street opened on a weak note. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.1 lower at 90.6. PolyGram, the music subsid- iary of Philips, added 80 cents to F141.60 on the news that it would spend Fl200m on expan- sion and on Monday's announcement of a marketing and distribution agreement with Motown Records. MADRID eased back after its recent strength. The general index slipped 0.66 to 277.46 in turnover of about Ptal2bn, down from Ptal3bn. OSLO fell in the absence of any positive news. The all- share index lost 6.47 or 1.3 per cent to 483.62 in turnover of NKr214m. STOCKHOLM eased in thin volume. The Affirs- virlden General index eased 2.20 to 1,067.0 as turnover dropped to SKrl84m. ISTANBUL dropped 1.9 per cent after Monday's 3.3 per cent rise. The 75-share index lost 55.82 to 2,884.21.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor ANOTHER poorly traded session in UK equities-saw prices turn easier at the close when Wall Street was slipping towards its nearest testing level and London was waiting to see if this morning brings the threatened Â£300m rights issue from Asda, the food supermarket group. Weakness in the US dollar and on Wall Street, which was within four Dow points of the 3,000 mark when London closed, unsettled the blue chip internationals. Consumer shares remained dull, with breweries falling as last week's takeover speculation faded. Once again, the significant feature was the reduction in turnover compared with last week. Retail business totalled only Â£784m on Monday, after a week in which daily retail lev- Aomme deale- Dltes Se1 Sep 30 Oct 14 Sp 26 Oct 10 Oct 24 Sep 27 Oct 11 Oct 25 00t Oct 21 Nov 4 els had hovered around Â£1.5bn. Yesterday's Seaq trading total, which takes in both retail and intra-market business, was 452.4m shares, compared with 349.7m on Monday. Uncertainty over the timing of the next general election in the UK was enhanced by the latest public opinion polls, which indicated that support is keenly balanced between the governing Conservative and opposition Labour parties. A new claim from Mr Nor- man Lamont, the UK chancel- lor of the exchequer, that the recession is over had little effect on a stock market still depressed by daily announce- ments of poor profits from leading British companies. Yes- terday, it was the turn of the building and construction sec- tor to test investors' nerves. The market opened lower and drifted down by nearly seven points on the Footsie scale. Shares steadied, per- versely after Tarmac, the con- struction company, delivered the expectedly poor half-time statement but let the market off the hook by not making a rights issue. Modest bear clos- ing by traders unwilling to leave positions to run until the equity account closes at the end of the week replaced the early loss with a gain of simi- lar proportions. Trading vol- ume, bowever, remained unim- pressive, with the institutions largely inactive. The market soon lost enthu- siasm again and share prices drifted downwards for the rest of the session. The final read- ing put the FT-SE Index at 2,576.6 for a decline on the day of 2.9 points. Equity chart spe- cialists expressed nervousness regarding the stock market's current rating level Trading slackened off in the final hour as traders tried to guess whether Asda would make its rights issue today. There is little argument that the food retailer needs to raise funds. The debate is over what terms it would have to offer in the shadow of last week's dire warning from the boardroom of a \"very significant deteriora- tion\" in profits this year. Nor is Asda the only name put forward as a candidate for the next fund-raising. Tarmac's non-appearance in the rights issue list turned the atten- tions of market traders to other stocks in the much bat- tered building and construc- tion sector. Cellular telephone issues, notably Vodafone, attracted interest following the takeover bid in the US, effectively worth $2.45bn, for Metro Mobile CTS from Bell Atlantic. The offer for Metro's equity and debt reopened the question of valua- tion of cellular 'phone operations. Vodafone is now the pure cellular 'phone stock in London, with British Tele- com participating via its Cell- net interests.",

   "text_content" : "NEWS FROM the US that Bell Atlantic, one of the seven Bell operating companies, had bid for Metro Mobile, the last big independent US cellular radio group, prompted a late surge of demand for shares in Voda- sone, the UK cellular radio group recently demerged from Racal Electronics. Vodafone has been regarded as an early takeover target after being identified in the late 1980s by Cable and Wireless, which built a 2.8 per cent stake in Racal Electronics, triggering the Vodafone flotation. Vodafone closed 7 higher at 375p, making the stock the sec- ond best performer in the PT-SE 100 index on the day. Turnover reached 4m shares. Bell Atlantic is offering $1.65bn for Metro's equity but is also taking on $800m of debt, effectively valuing Metro at a2.45bn. Mr Patrick Wellington, telecoms analyst at County NatWest, said the Bell offer valued Metro at $213 per head of population covered by its cellular licence area, Vodafone, he said, is currently valued at $113 per head of population covered by its cellular licence. The County analyst des- cribed Vodafone as \"cheap and available\", and said a Metro- style valuation implied 700p a share for Vodafone. County has a 400p a share medium- term target for Vodafone. The analyst added: \"On fundamen- tals alone, a bid would add at least 100p to that figure.\" Glaxo upset Glaxo lost ground as the long-running debate within the medical profession over the safety of a class of drugs known as beta agonists flared again. Opposing viewpoints have been aired in the last few days at conferences in the US and Belgium. The company's new asthma drug Serevent is one of seven available beta agonist asthma treatments. It is seen by ana- lysts as one of Glaxo's most important potential money- spinners for the 1990s. A Canadian study published earlier this year appeared to show a correlation between the small number of deaths from asthma and the use of beta agonists. Some analysts argue that the increased risk only becomes significant at very high doses, an indication that those patients were already severely ill and at risk of dying. Health regulatory authorities in the US and UK are nevertheless re- examining the status of beta agonists. Glaxo shares fell 21 to 1362p in steady turnover. Vickers unsettled Vickers, the engineering group which owns Rolls-Royce Motors, dipped 3 to 185p ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. These are expected to show profits eroded to break-even from the Â£39.8m achieved in the same period last year, according to the most bearish engineering sector specialists. The market range is from break-even up to Â£15m. It was announced yesterday that Rolls-Royce Motors is clos- ing down for an extra two weeks at Christmas because of poor sales. Mr David Plaistow, Vickers' chairman, warned of the poor performance of this subsidiary in April this year. Turnover in Asda, the trou- bled food supermarket group, was a brisk 7.3m as the shares fell 4% to 59%p on the wide- spread belief that there will be a rights issue today. Once again the withdrawal from the market of the US investment house which was actively bidding for stock at the end of last week left the shares unsupported. Tarmac's interim figures were much as expected, with profits savaged but no cash-call and a maintained interim pay- ment. The shares ended a frac- tion ahead at 202p, albeit on heavy turnover of 6.1m. Mr David Taylor, building sector specialist at Robert Fleming, pencilled in a full-year target of Â£80m but cautioned: \"It is hard to see the shares making progress.\" Today brings a lull in the spate of figures from the sector but tomorrow sees announce- ments from Redland, Ibstock Johnsen and Travis Perkins. Also due to report is Barratt Developments, which analysts expect to reveal a loss of around Â£100m. There were sug- gestions in the market that Barratt is lining up a Â£100m rights issue priced at 40p a share. Barratt edged up to 48p. An upbeat morning meeting at S.G. Warburg on Rothmans helped the often-volatile shares climb 27 to 1112p. Turnover was above average. The broker said underperformance in recent months meant there was now a buying opportunity. BAT Industries gained ground as stories circulated that the company's insurance subsidiary Eagle Star was about to announce job cuts amounting to about 10 per cent of the workforce. The sugges- tion was that senior manage- ment might also leave. The shares rose 12 before ending at 645p for a net gain of 7 on good turnover. BOC continued to benefit from James Capel's recommen- dation on Monday, climbing 6 to 579p. Lep Group's fall from grace gathered pace, the shares col- lapsing a further 16 to 20p. On Monday the stock tumbled from 87p to 36p after Lep warned that its first-half prof- its would be close to Â£1.9m, that it would omit the interim dividend and that it was hold- ing talks with its bankers. Oil shares again failed to make any progress as the Opec meeting in Geneva got under way. Some analysts said the stance adopted by Saudi Arabia, to produce 8.5m barrels a day, \"would keep the market truly well supplied\", and should be construed as bearish for oil prices and oil shares. But others were more optimis- tic. Mr Fergus MacLeod at County NatWest said that for the past month and for the first time since the Gulf crisis the oil price and oil sector have gone in opposite directions. The sector has underperformed by 3.5 per cent and the oil price has risen by 7 per cent, bring- ing the sector back towards FT.A A114Share Index 130C 125C 120C 115 Equity Shares Traded Tumover by volume (million) Excluding: Intm-malrt buslne & Overe tumaover 600 400 200 0 buying levels. county sala Shell was its preferred selec- tion but that \"even BP looks ripe for a bounce ahead of the presentation on Thursday\". Aviva continued to advance, adding a penny at 15p to leave the stock up around 66 per cent in just over a week. The mar- ket is expecting good news from the company's latest well in Colombia, a \"rank wildcat\", or exploration well, called Miraflor. The absence of any takeover attempt on Allied-Lyons in the wake of last week's bid specu- lation caused some short-term investors to sell. The shares retreated 16 to 628p. Beer, wines and spirits com- pany Joseph Holt firmed 18 to a new high of 1993p in the wake of a 21 per cent rise in half-time profits to Â£3.3m. Bass eased 2 to 975p. Hoare Govett trimmed profits fore- casts for the company but maintained its buy recommen- dation. Boots was a good market on news that the advisory com- mittee of the US Food and Drug Administration would consider the company's heart drug Manoplax for approval on October 25. That day sees the advisory committee also looking at Fisons' Tilade and the status of beta agonists, a type of asthma treatment. Fired Earth Tiles appreci- ated 13 to 85p ahead of inter- ims expected today. Bid talk in the stores sector rumbled on. Sears was 6 ahead at one point and ended at 95p for a net gain of 2. Kingfisher, its supposed predator, retreated another 7 to 444p. Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIMS (\"). BRITISH FUNDS () Tr 2pc I-L 1992.

Turn- over reached 3.4m, highest since July. Traders also noted persistent buying of calls in the traditional options market. Mirror Group slipped 5 to 89p. A surprise Â£39.6m rights issue took some of the gloss off good interim figures from Meg- gitt Holdings, the engineering group. Meggitt shares settled a net 4 lower at 98p, after an initial decline to 95p. The recent gloom surround- ing British Aerospace, trig- gered by the profits slide and rights issue, lifted somewhat and the shares rallied 5 to 425p. Brent Chemicals fell 8 to 158p on interim results in spite of a confident statement from the management. Laporte continued to benefit from its recent encouraging trading statement even though some securities houses are beginning to see the stock as overvalued. The shares gained 9 to 600p. Commercial property dealer Dwyer receded 10 to 125p after the company said it would pass the dividend on its preference shares. MARKET REPORTERS.

   "text_content" : "THE FUTURES market contin- ued to show reluctance to move upwards yesterday as expiry of the September Foot- sie future approached, writes Peter John. There appeared to be flick- ers of life at one stage, but hopes of a rise were short- lived and the September Foot- sie future contract closed at 2,589, up only one point on the day and at a premium of 12 to the underlying cash index. The September contract is still trading above its estimated fair value, and a trader argued that the December contract would carry on the trend. Turnover at the official close was 5,262, while the December contract saw 2,000 lots dealt. There was rolling of positions from September to December but dealers were restrained as the spread between the two remained unprofitably low. Turnover in the LTOM was enlivened by the run-up to the expiry of September series stock options today. This boosted trade in Sears and Hillsdown, the busiest stock options, although Sears was also affected by the continuing takeover speculation sur- rounding the company. In the Footsie Index option almost half of the turnover of 5,300 lots related to a tech- nical spread trade carried out by Sheppards.",
