THURSDAY Evening. Little progress seemed to be made towards clarifying the position in the foreign exchanges and many problems were still unsolved to-day. As far as turnover was concerned, the tendency was still to offer American dollars. The Bank of England took dollar notes in small amounts at $4.13, as against $4.08. Conditions in the Money market were described as easier than yesterday. Clear ing and non-clearing banks appeared to be in possession of funds, for which state of affairs recent official operations were re- sponsible. The Bank of England return disclosed a new high record note circula tion, but bankers' deposits benefited sub- stantially from the swing over from public deposits. Fresh accommodation against bills was available at 3 per cent., while before the close outside lenders were granting loans at 2% per cent. Business in bills was moderate, but one clearing bank took some November bills irst at 3', per cent. and then at 3% per cent. \" Hot\" bills changed hands at 3% per cent., but :3\"/, per cent. was still quoted for three months bank drafts.

Sterling was kept steady in terms of the U.S. dollar at $4.02 to $4.06 and the Cana dian dollar at $4.40 to $4.42. At first, the French franc rate was announced at 174 to 175, but within a short time the official quotation was adjusted in favour of sterling to 175-176.

   "text_content" : "CASH DEALINGS Yesterday's trial run on the Stoce Exchange can hardly be described as even a dress rehearsal of the cash dealings programme which i- still in process of preparation for the approval of the investing public. What should have been Pay-day foi last Account was largely spent in dis cussing the best and quickest way te clear up the postponed Settlemen: which is to be held on 21st September As one broker put it: \"When we havw been able to settle up we shall soon bN able to settle down.\" American Activity Commodity shares and YankeeÃ½ enjoyed, so far as I could make out the bulk of what business was carried through yesterday. There was a half. hearted attempt to form the customary Street market in Americans after the Stock Exchange closed. There were again complaints as tc what appeared the very poor prices obtainable by sellers of Yankees as compared with the overnight parities For example, United States Steel were cabled yesterday morning as equivaleni to $79g London. Yet they opened here at only 741 and later eased to 73J Chrysler came over at 1008, opened iin London at 98 and weakened to 96. One big outside firm is credibly rumoured to have made a profit of Â£30,000- Â£50,000 in the past two days from buying Yankees on the basis of such wide margins as those just mentioned and unloading the stock on New York, The dollar proceeds have, of course, tc be exchanged for sterling at the Bank of England. In point of fact anyone who has successfully arbitraged in Yankees this week has required plenty of pluck and exceptional facilities. If the stock has to be shipped in surance alone will, I am told, cost about 32 per cent. Perhaps more important is the fact that unless a dealer has a \"pocket\" buying order he has to take the risk, if he buys in the morning, of not knowing what price he will be able to get in New York when Wall Street opens at 3 o'clock- Ionaon time. Cabling in plain language to New York may, moreover, fail to elicit a reply under an hour. Old and New Loves Most members were mindful of the adage to be off with the old love before you are on with the new. It is true that the open position to be settled, or arranged, on 21st Sep- tember is not large by normal standards. Nevertheless, until a line can be written in the books under pre- September bargains, the way will not be really clear for comfortable deal- ing under the new cash regime. Experience from 1915 onwards would seem to promise that cash deal- ings will on balance favour bulls. But supplies of stocks and shares have irst to be made available for prompt delivery. For example, if existing contango positions are to be closed wherever convenient, then members will have to be allowed for the present to treat such closing transactions as for 21st September Account and not for cash. htne Diarist",

The business will be carried on under the same style by the remaining partners, Sir Richard W. Eaton and Messrs. E. A. Coffey, C. S. Willmott and R. L. Eaton. It is hoped that at some future time Mr. Bridgewater will be able to resume his activities with the firm."

   "text_content" : "THURSDAY Evening. Dealings in the Stock Exchange re opened to-day with a good attendance but without much improvement ii turnover. Activity in most market; about equalled yesterday's business although, in view of the condition prevailing, some brokers did mor business than they had anticipated. The number of bargains marked ir all markets totalled 1,768. Such \"patchy\" and quiet condi tions can be explained by the closini of both short and long positions, the necessity for raising funds to mee war conditions and the activities o: the \"bargain hunter.\" Demand so: Shipping and American shares con tinued. The tone of markets was generall: steady, but attempts to do business on the basis of the nominal prices quoted while the House had been closed caused somn wide adjustments in quotations. Price generally remained quite nominal. British Funds opened firmer and re gained their equilibrium after showing hesitancy during the early afternoon Turnover was about on a par with yester day's business. Several stocks finished at prices slightly above the fixed minima. Consols 2% per cent. rose % to 62% and Local Loans the same fraction to 73%S Consols 4 per cent. at 98% and Conversion 4% per cent. at 100%7 were both % higher Bank stock was marked up 5 to 300. CZECH BONDS DOWN Dealers in the foreign market reported a little more activity, although turnover was still very small. There was no pressure to sell, probably because of the \"despair\" levels at which most of the more active stocks have been standing. Absence of market flexibility was illus trated by a fall of 5 points to 40 in Czecl 8 per cents, and a rise of 6 to 27% ir German Potash Sevens. Japanese bonds reflected reports of Japan's intended neutrality in Europe. The 4 per cent. 1899 at 29 and the 6 per cent. 1924 loans were each 2 up. RAILS IDLE The marketstill awaited news of th terms on which the Government has acquired control of the railways, and busi ness in Home Rail stocks remained small. Prior charges were stationary at the minimum rates fixed on Monday and little stock came on offer. Ordinary stocks were inclined to weakness. Southern Deferred Ordinary closed 1% points lower at 10, Great Western were 1 point down at 25%. Brum dropped % to 11 and Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary lost a point to 55. The Foreign Rail list passed an even quieter session, and there were few changes at the close. Some heavy downward adjustments occurred in prices for Indian Railway stocks, which have not so far reflected the recent fall in gilt-edged securities. No business was recorded in any of the lead- ing issues. Where quoted at all, American Rails were marked up sharply to conform with overnight Wall Street advices. INDUSTRIALS CHEERFUL Dealings Handicapped by Shortage of Shares Some of the Industrial groups enjoyed a fair measure of support. The fact that dealing was on a cash basis and to a large extent a matter of negotiation, owing to the limited supply of stock, tended to restrict the turnover. In many cases jobbers would not sell if they had not the stock on their books. Potential buyers found this the chief handicap in the search for shares. The Shipping group perhaps more than any other section suffered from this handicap. Inquiries for such shares were numerous but, outside a few of the popular issues, dealing became a matter of difficulty. The black spot was the Aviation group, which closed flat. On the other hand, Steel and Armament shares, while not conspicuous, were by no means weak. In the BANKING section a few trans- actions took place among Home issues and price changes were slight. In the Discount group Alexanders Discounts were marked down 5s to 52s 6d. INSURANCE shares mostly were lower, due principally to a downward readjustment of values rather than to sales. Declines predominated in ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS. The chief rise was Is 6d to 20s 6d in Ever Ready, which is expected to benefit from demand for electric torches and lamps. English Electrics were down Is 6d to 33s. Several ELECTRICITY issues were easier. Cable and Wireless Ordinary fell 3 to 46 on a few sales. Canadian Marconis were wanted and jumped 9d to 5s. HAWKERS REALISED Fords were firmer at 17s among MOTORS, which otherwise were easier, with Tillings 4s 9d down at 41s 3d on lack of buyers.

Hawker Siddeleys changed down to 13s 1%d and left off at 13s 6d with a net loss of 2s. Bristol Aero- planes changed as low as 13s 9d and nished at 15s 7%d with a loss of Is 1%d. Imperial Airways yielded 2s to 30s. Shares like Imperial Chemicals and Turner and Newalls were in request with- out altering prices much.

IRON and STEEL shares generally were steady, with Bir- mingham Small Arms and Stewarts and Lloyds each a few pence better. Radiations were lowered 3s l%d to 35s. In SHIPPING, the principal business was in P. and 0. Deferred and Furness Withy, each of which gained 2s 6d. Dealings up to 21s 9d were done in King Line and at 3s 6d in Brynymors.

Among TOBACCOS, gains of %. each were secured by British-American and Imperials. BREWERY issues made no head- way and were out of favour, but Distillers were up 2s to 92s. A good deal of activity was witnessed during the day in American Industrials and business passed in U.S. Steels on the basis of 73%, in Bethlehems around 96, Republics 27%, General Motors 58% and Chryslers 96. LEADING OILS DEALT IN Rubbers Improve-Tea Shares Inactive The turnover of OIL shares was small, but a moderate business was done in one or two of the leaders without much effect on prices. The majority of quotations again were largely nominal. Shells were the most active stock with business between 4% and 4% and a rise of e at the close at the former level. Royal Dutch were a little easier, showing a fall of a point at 39 after changing hands down to 37%. Burmahs marked a number of times between 3'%2 and 3%. and closed with an improvement of %, at 3' %. Mexican Eagles were dealt in between 4s 9d and 5s 1%d, Trinidad Leaseholds from 4 3', to 4%'3. and Trinidad Petroleum Develop- ments at 46s 4%d and 47s 1d. Kerns were marked between 2s 10%d and 3s 3d. Rubber share quotations, where they were altered, were mainly dearer, but business was small. The spot price for the commodity rose at one time to 10%d nominal, against only 8\"/.d when the market was last open, but finished at 9%d, a rise of 1'%d on the previous close. A strong tone in America was the reason for the rise in rubber, demand finding the market poorly supplied. Among the leading shares, Rubber Trust were easier, losing part of yester- day's gain of 2s 6d and finishing at 27s 6d. Anglo-Dutch were firm at the previous advance to 26s 3d. United Sua Betong also held their ground at 48s 9d. Batu Tiga added 2s 6d at 22s 6d, Labu the same amount at 37s 6d, together with Harrisons and Crosfield Deferred at 80s. Pataling, also wanted, could not be obtained and rose Is 10%d to 27s 6d. The market finished firm, but an acute shortage of shares was apparent. In Mincing Lane demand was keen and quotations advanced. Allied Sumatra were dealt in at 16s 6d. There was not much going on in the Tea share market, where brokers and dealers await further particulars of the Government control of the produce. Prices hardly moved. Deamoolie were inquired for and finished Is 3d up at 45s and Lunuva were also wanted and improved from 28s 6d to 29s. In the \" Lane\" similar conditions pre- vailed. Lunuva were inquired for at 28s 6d. KAFFIRS STEADY There was comparatively little actual dealing in Kaffirs. The general inclina- tion was to do nothing beyond clearing up existing open commitments where pos- sible. Apart from this, a cautious ten-- dency continued to be induced by the lack of any indication as to the new South African Government's attitude towards the proposal to appropriate the proceeds of gold sales above 150s an ounce. Share prices remained wide and on a negotiable basis. Where changed they were mostly lower. Johannesburg is to remain closed until next Monday. Meantime, much initiative can hardly be expected from dealers in London. Exceptions to the general trend were Randfontein, which rose k/ to 1%, and Rand Mines, which closed Y up at 8%. East Rand Props. improved %. to 2%.. Central Mining Bearer were lowered ! to 14. General Mining lost 5'/ to 4 on the postponement of the interim dividend decision. Non-producers were not often men- tioned. West Wits. were called % down at 3% and Venterspost Ya off at 11%'. Wes- tern Holdings weakened 3d to 11s 3d. The company announces that drilling is to be continued and shaft-sinking considered at the earliest convenient opportunity. ASHANTIS RELAPSE On the prospect that West African mines will be allowed to reap the benefit of anyway the greater part of the higher gold price, share quotations opened firmly. The sharp rise in Ashanti to 3% in yesterday's Street dealings attracted sellers, and these shares relapsed %s to 3%.. Some rather unreasonable disappointment was evi- dently caused by the fact that the mine profit for August was a trifle lower than in July. As with Kaffirs, revenue was based on gold at 148s last month. The Bibiani, on the other hand, made a profit of Â£22,703 against Â£13,288 in July, the first material fruits of the extended plant now being brought into operation. Bibiani rose Is to 27s. Ariston reacted 6d to 12s. Of other Gold shares, Champion Reef, Nundydroog and Mysore each gained ei in the Indian section. Among West Aus- tralians, Wiluna gave way Is to 8s 3d. It was feared that exchange restrictions in the Commonwealth will limit the benefit of the higher gold price anyway to the English registered companies. RHOKANA HIGHER Rhodesian Coppers were firm, but below the best. Rhokana rose 1% to 12% (the best price this year) and Rhodesian Anglo- American Is 3d to 24s 3d. On, the other hand, Roan fell 3d on balance to 17s 3d, after 18s, and Rhodesian Selection closed unchanged at 15s, after 16s. Of other Coppers, Rio Tinto moved up Yi to 11, but Indian Copper at 3s 6d relinquished Is of their big rise in the two preceding days. A number of Tin shares scored rises of up to 'A. South Crofty were inquired for on the settlement of the long-drawn-out labour dispute at the company's mine in Cornwall. The shares were called 8s. Among Lead-Zincs, Burma held at 10s. Ds the Barriers, North Broken Hill put on %Â· to 1'%\". In the Diamond section De Beers Deferred were marked back Y/ to j%, but the Preference rose",

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange markets pre- sented a moderately busy appearance after the reopening. In the majority of cases, last Thursday's levels were taken as a rough basis for the negotia- tion of most of the bargains that required to be done. Jobbers in the gilt-edged market took stock at the minimum prices, as they were able to sell it at a modest fraction above these figures. Shipping shares became nearly impossible to buy. Americans commanded a certain amount of interest. Gold-mining shares kept firm; there was no great rush to buy them. The House closed at 3 o'clock, as it did after the reopening in January, 1915. Several uniforms appeared during the day. Guesses at Truth Apart from immediate hour-to-hour considerations, a general topic for discussion in the House is the price at which a new Government loan would be offered. Various estimates were made yesterday. Personally, I found that the guesses were too far apart to allow of their being averaged with any degree of the truth being reached in this manner. Home Railway Speculations Until the Government's proposals in regard to the taking-over of the Home Railways' working are published, dealing in Home Railway stocks re- mains a matter of speculation. As previously observed, the jobbers in the Home Railway market have estab- lished an unofficial state of minimum prices. These apply to the Prior- Charge, but not to the Ordinary stocks. It may be found, when the Govern- ment's decision is announced, that Brum Preference, at 38, is likely to stand out as being one of the cheapest of its kind. Bank of England Transfers The reason for the muddle that has arisen over the transfer of British Government and other registered stocks lies in the Treasury's desire which resulted in the Bank of England Transfer Offices being moved 60 miles from London. This step im- poses an obvious barrier upon pay- ment on delivery for registered stock by Stock Exchange dealers who are taking that stock into their own names. A petition went round the Consol market yesterday asking for a reversion to the previous practice of not paying for registered Government stock until it had been cleared. At 2.30 yesterday afternoon repre- sentatives of the Bank met those of Stock Exchange firms in the Com- mittee Room with the intention of finding a solution to the difficulties.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "The reopening of the Stock Ex- change yesterday emphasises the speed with which the national sinan- cial machine is being adjusted to the circumstances of wartime and the exigencies of war economy. A week ago to-day, and on the following Mon- day, the House was closed, and no dealings took place. On Tuesday and Wednesday inter-office dealings occurred, and members effected trans- actions in the street until they were moved on by the police. Yesterday the Floor of the House was again open to members, and although business is, of course, subject to the emergency regulations (the most important of which is that requiring all transac- tions to be on a cash basis), it is a heartening sign of the high level of national morale that the security mar- ket with the most complex ramifica- tions of any in the world should be able to reopen its doors within so short a time of the starting of a major conflict. The transition period has been in- valuable in that it has permitted a more or less gradual adjustment of prices to the new conditions. In many of the less active stocks, however, this adjustment has not been possible, and nominal prices at the start of yester- day's session were still those of the close a week earlier. It is that fact which accounts for all the larger price movements recorded in THE FINANCIAL TIMES this morning. As was to be expected, activity was at a low level. Buying and selling for the most part was connected with the adjustment of positions entered into before the commencement of hostili- ties. At the same time, brokers were not surprised, after the indications which they had received in the two preceding days, to find that there was a fair volume of buying inquiries from the public. Responsible members of the House, however, are far from wish- ing for any sudden rush of optimistic buying. What is to be desired is a very gradual return to conditions which are as near to normal as is possible in the difficult circumstances of the present time. That is not feasible before the existing position has been more or less cleared up at the postponed Settlement of 21st Sep- tember. There is no doubt that the emergency regulations of the Stock Exchange can quickly be made to work satisfactorily, for good will and co-operation will not be lacking to smooth over the initial difficulties. Cash dealings, of course, will con- tinue indefinitely, but some relaxation of the existing restrictions is not out of the question. The general aim of the Committee must be to create as flexible a market as possible and to facilitate the Government's financing activities.",

   "text_content" : "International difficulties do not seem, up to date, to have falsified the optimis- tic view taken by Mr. Philip Hill in June of the outlook for the Beechams Pills group. The parent company announces a first interim dividend of 6 per cent. on its Deferred shares, but the alterations in the capital during the past year preclude a straight com- parison with the 17j per cent. paid twelve months ago. So far as the old shareholders are concerned, the present payment is the more favourable, as it is equivalent to 18 per cent. on the shares they held last September, but that is not the whole of the story. The changes began with a capital bonus for the Deferred shareholders of 200 per cent. a few days after last year's first interim declaration. The Macleans holding had been already bought, but in December the offer for Eno Proprietaries shares became effec- tive, and this resulted in the issue of more Deferred shares which brought up their total from Â£300,000 to Â£1,512,400. Thus the amount to be disbursed on the present occasion will be Â£90,700 gross instead of Â£52,500.",

The decision, which is taken in view of the international situation, breaks a tradition of regular payments extend- ing over many years. The company regularly paid 3k per cent. as an in- terim and 9 per cent. as a final, until last year, when the final was reduced to 8k per cent., making 12 per cent. against 124 per cent. for many years previously. As one of the leading suburban stores, operating in a thickly popu- lated area, the action of the directors of Jones and Higgins is of particular intefest at the present juncture. The evacuation of large numbers of people from the central areas has created a problem for the whole of the retail trade of London which may not be easy to solve. How quickly the situa- tion has deteriorated within the space of days is shown by so unexpected a decision.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The latest Bank of England weekly statement faithfully reflects the huge gold transfer to the Exchange Fund announced on Wednesday. The nominal figure left in the Issue Department after this major operation is Â£102,189, presumably, as already suggested here, representing gold coin as opposed to bullion. Except for this modest amount, therefore, the whole of our bank notes are fiduciary for the first time. It is to be noted that the total note issue has been raised by over Â£17,000,000 to Â£580.1 millions, whereas the revaluation of the gold stock in itself-if the statement had been in the old style-would have justified an expansion of some Â£15.7 millions only. The Exchange Fund, therefore, either handed over additional securities to make up the rnund figure of Â£280,000,000, or the Issue Department bought a little gold from the fund prior to the operation. We must emphasise, however, that there is nothing in- flationary in this development; indeed, it even militates against inflation. Evacuation, mobilisation and pre- paration (by the banks against all eventualities) explain the jump of over Â£20,000,000 in the active note circula- tion to the new all time record of Â£549.9 millions. One more historic Bank Return. Knotty Problems If brevity is the soul of wit, then the compiler of the forms, rules and regula- tions for the new emergency dealings in foreign exchange has no pretensions to being funny. It would be idle to pre- tend that anything else but confusion prevails among the banks at the moment. Harassed dealers, authorised and un- authorised, have actually had different official rulings on the same point. In- deed, in several cases, judgments have been given, reversed and then reversed again. Many inquiries have yet to be answered and many positions clarified. It was satisfactory to find yesterday, however, that more reasonable quotations were forthcoming for notes of the various \" official \" countries. At first, the rates were the same as the T.T. quotations, but these were ob- viously wrong in view of the onerous charges for insurance of notes. Yesterday, the authorities raised the rate for U.S. dollar notes to $4.13. It would help matters enormously if the leading authorised dealers-all of whom have great experience-could be left to use their own initiative and common sense. Valuable time, which could have been saved, is being wasted. Has this fact been recognised by the appointment of a leading firm of brokers as Sub-section I of the Bank of England to act in an informative and advisory capacity to dealers?",

The company has now paid a total dividend of 15 per cent. for many years, with the addition of a cash bonus of 5 per cent. in each of the past four years. Prosperity for the type of business carried on by the company depends more on peace time than war time work, and its direct interest in arma- ments is not large.

   "text_content" : "Since last year's meeting of Tindals Gold Mines the operating subsidiary, Consolidated Gold Mines of Cool- gardie, has come into production. The treatment plant, having a capacity of 5,000 tons a month, was completed at a cost of Â£700 below the estimate. It began crushing in June with satisfac- tory results. Normal figures as to costs, tonnage treated, recovery and so on, however, are not expected to be obtained much before November or December. Mr. Linton Thorp informed shareholders at yesterday's meeting that ore reserves of 319,600 tons aver- aging 4.66 dwts represent over five years' supply to the first unit of the treatment plant now ih operation. In the view of the new mine super- intendent the estimate is conservative, and as regards grade the bulk sample of some of the blocks at present being stoped shows a better average than that of the reserves. It is hoped to reduce costs by some 6s per ton, and with a slight raising of grade profits would be materially increased. The higher price of gold is a favourable factor.",

   "text_content" : "The third annual ordinary general meet- ing of Tindals Gold Mines, Ltd., was held yesterday at Winchester House, Old Broad- street, E.C., MR. LINTON T. THORP, K.C., LL.B., J.P. (the chairman), presiding. The Secretary (Mr. Harold E. Fern, F.C.I.S.) having read the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors, The Chairmlin, in the course of his speech, said: Gentlemen,-Before review- ing the work of the past year, it is my sad duty to record the death of Mr. James MacCallum Smith, who has been a director of this company since its inception. Mr. MacCallum Smith was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Aus- tralia (representing North Perth for many years) and his influence with the Govern- ment of Western Australia was of the greatest assistance to your company. Mr. MacCallum Smith visited this country last year, and, on his return to Australia, com- menced periodical visits to the mine. I feel sure you will all share our deep regret at his passing, and wish to extend an ex- pression of sympathy to his widow. We could, of course, have held our meeting in July or August, but, as so many people are on holiday at that time, it was considered advisable to wait until Septem- ber. Naturally, we did not foresee that the meeting would take place under war con- ditions. Also we had hoped, by this time, to be able to be in possession of the results for August, as these, when to hand, will give a fair indication of what can be ex- pected on a normal basis. I do not antici- pate, however, that normal figures as to costs, tonnage treated, recovery, etc., can be obtained much before November or December of this year, and I am looking for constant improvement up to that date. THE THEATMENT PLANT The accounts of the company call for little comment, but it will be seen that a further Â£23,983 sterling was advanced to the operating company during 1938. The treatment plant, which has a capacity of 5,000 tons of ore per month, was ordered in August last, and the erection was com- pleted in May of this year, which was well within the scheduled time. The total cost of this first unit was Â£32,570 Australian currency and, as this represents a saving of over Â£700 Aus- tralian on the estimate, I am sure you will agree that this reflects great credit indeed on all those responsible, particularly as the plant has operated entirely satisfac- torily since its trial run, with only a bare minimum of necessary adjustments. This plant has been designed in such a way that a second unit can be conveniently added to bring the capacity up to 10,000 tons per month. We had hoped to arrange this extension immediately, but, in view of the present war situation, it will be necessary to await the clearing of the position before any practical steps can be taken. ORE RESERVES The mine superintendent had received cabled instructions to send us the August results and all other late information which would have been of interest to you. Unfortunately we have not yet received his cable, and I am afraid it may have been delayed by the international situa- tion. Therefore I cannot add a great deal to the information already in your posses- sion. As you know, the ore reserves have been estimated at 319,646 tons, averaging 4.66 dwts. This represents over five years' supply for the first unit of the treatment plant now in operation, which is an ample reserve for any operating property. In connection with the ore reserve posi- tion, an extract from a letter received from the present mine superintendent, dated 17th August, 1939, is very satis- factory. He states:- \" After a careful study of the plant and examination of the calculation of ore re- serves, I consider the estimate has been made on a conservative basis, both as to tonnage and grade. With regard to grade, the bulk sample of some of the blocks at present being stoped shows a better average than that already estimated in the reserves.\" LATEST RESULTS You will, I know, be anxious to have the latest information in regard to mine pro- duction. I am pleased to be able to inform you that constant progress is being made in the reduction of the tailings losses, in the increase of the grade of ore treated and in the reduction of costs. Un- fortunately, as I have said before, I have not yet received the August results and can only repeat the June and July results to-day, which you already have received. As you were informed, in June 5,040 tons were treated, yielding 971 fine ounces of gold, the value being Â£8,969 Australian currency, which showed a working profit of Â£2,507 Australian. Considering this was the first month's operation and that the plant absorption was high, it can be considered a satisfac- tory start. In July 5,089 tons were treated, producing 1,234 fine ounces of gold, the value being Â£11,400 Australian currency and the working profit Â£4,378 Australian. We expect that the figures under every heading will gradually improve; in fact, the new mine superintendent states that he hopes to reduce the mining costs by approximately 6s per ton. With such a reduction, and a slight increase in grade, the profits will, of course, be materially in- creased. Further, we are ndt yet in a position to include in the ore treated any appreciable quantity of the high-grade oxide ore above the 200-ft level, and it is anticipated that it will be another month before the stopes are ready at that level. The inclusion of a portion of this class of ore will improve the grade treated each month. PRICE OF GOLD The recently published embargo on the snipimnt. oi gula irum austrmLia cannot materially affect your company, and, as you know, the Australian Government was most helpful to the gold-mining companies during the last war. We are therefore entitled to anticipate thaL they will be equally sympathetic in the present war. The price of gold has materially appre- ciated during recent months, and I see no reason to anticipate any decline; in fact, we should look for a further increase in price. At the last general meeting I was per- haps rash enough to say that, when we met again, the company would be in production, and I am happy to be able to say now that my expectation has been fulfilled. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted; the retiring directors were re-elected and the auditors re- appointed. The meeting closed with a cordial vote of thanks to the Chairman, directors and staff at the mine.",

   "text_content" : "With the reopening of the Stock Exchange and many com- modity markets yesterday the machinery of the City returned to more normal working conditions. Stock Exchange members again showed keenness to provide a public market in securities, and despite the inevitable war absences there was a good attendance at the commencement of business. Turnover hardly came up to expectations. Dealings were unevenly distributed, although Shipping and American securities, as well as some leading Industrials, attracted a good deal of attention. SOME BARGAIN-HUNTING Activity elsewhere consisted largely of the closing of existing positions and the raising of relatively small amounts of money. A little bargain-hunting was reported. Although the tone was steady some adjustments in quota- tions were made. The nominal prices in force since the House was closed a week ago often required adjustment when tested by actual attempts to do business. It is anticipated that business may develop when the public becomes more accustomed to war markets and the 21st September Settlement has been completed. Commodities were firm, though prices remained nominal in some cases, while in others business was limited by regulations restricting transactions on foreign account. SHARP RISE IN RUBBER Spot Touches 10d per lb A chief feature in those markets which reopened yesterday was a sharp advance in rubber. Aided by the over- night strength of New York and the recent depreciation of sterling, the spot quotation touched 10d a pound, against the previous close of 81'd on 31st August, before relapsing to 92d- a net gain of 11d. HEAVY TRADING IN TIN Total of 1,800 Tons Tin provided the chief feature of markets in which trading had already been resumed. Dealings on a scale without pre- cedent in recent years occurred during the short session on the London Metal Ex- change. From noon to 12.15 p.m. no less than 1,800 tons changed hands. Although the cash price remained at the upper limit of Â£230 a ton prescribed under the buffer stock scheme, the three months quotation, which for many weeks has been at a-dis- count, closed the remaining gap of Â£2 to reach the upper limit. Before the outbreak of war the forward position was quoted at Â£226; on Wednesday it rose to Â£228. Yesterday's trading was notable for sub- stantial buying of cash tin from the pool against sales of three months metal. That the forward position was well supported is attributable to the uncertainty regarding supplies and war-risk rates during the coming months. There were again no dealings in copper, lead and zinc, as arrangements regarding the control and fixation of prices for these metals are still proceeding with the Government. Cotton prices were steady at Liverpool, spot American middling closing 5 points higher at 7.03d a pound, though Egyptian Giza, after recent advances, was finally unchanged at 8.54d a pound.

   "text_content" : "Sterling was maintained in terms of the United States dollar yesterday at $4.02 to $4.06, while no further alteration was made in the Canadian dollar. Among the official Continental cur- rencies, the initial quotation for the French franc was 174-175 as on Wednesday, but within a short time it was changed to 175-176, an adjustment, it is believed, which was made at the request of the French authorities. Swiss francs appre- ciated from 18.02 to 17.96. One or two more \" free \" market rates were obtainable, but these were either nominal or sellers only. More quotations, too, were forthcoming for the notes of various countries. U.S. dollar notes were $4.13, against $4.08, Canadian dollar notes $4.52, French franc notes 178, against 177, Swiss notes 18.26.",

The huge gold sale by the Bank of England (announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday) to the Exchange Equalisation Account is reflected in the latest weekly statement of the Central Bank. As a result of this large operation, the gold holding in the Issue Department is reduced to the nominal figure of Â£102,189-the lowest in the Bank's history. The fiduciary issue is raised to Â£580,000,000, so that the total note issue is Â£580,102,189, an increase of Â£17,091,489 on the week. Extensive evacuation, increased mobilisation and the replenishment of \" tills \" by the banks led to an expan- sion of Â£20,387,233 in the active note circulation to the new high record of Â£549,886,038.

We expect any day a definite ruling on the question of business carried over. R. R.
