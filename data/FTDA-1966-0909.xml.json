   "text_content" : "By Our Foreign Editor The Commonwealth Prime Minister Conference took a bitter tarn yesterday with the African delegates preaneg Mr. Harold Wilson for a Arm couNitment, that Britahi would not \"sell .out\" by granting indepenudeace to Rhodesia before African majority rule had been achieved. This has given the British Government a difficult decision to take by the week-end. Mr. Wilson called a meeting of Ministers concerned with Rhodesia yesterday to discuss it, and a full Cabinet meeting may be held to-day. In Whitehall, Mr. Wilson is not expected to agree to the Africans' demand, because he would thereby sacrifice what slender chance remains of any agreement in the \"talks about talks \" with the Smith regime. The Prime Minister is not now expected to reply to his African critics until Monday; he may hope that the week-end of visits in separate groups by the delegates toChequers wil induce a calmer mood. In any case, it now looks as if Rhodesia will dominate the conference until it ends next Thursday. Sir Albert Margai, the Prime Minister, of Sierra Leone, took up nearly all morning and part of the afternoon yesterday in a filibuster accusing Mr. Wilson of bad faith. ie 'quoted 'a Bitish 1Governmen; Blue Book to show that Mr. Wilson was prepared to rant independence to a white minority Government in Rhodesia. Margt Qul e as ctfrom In October 1965 justeore UDI k SSir AlbWet wndersto to ha e qhioted ihe pb age of1the Bioo hadokon theb'Anglrs ten monas the rant ofi conen denc befor majority rule was actually achiedb.\" (This-was at talks heol in October 1965, just before UDLI But Mr. Wilson denied that he had misled tl Comminbwealth on this point. because the Blue Book had been pudblished ten months ago, and its contents had been public knowledge for all that time. Sir Albert said that even Sir Alec Douglas-Home. had been more liberal on Rhodesia than Mr. 'Wilson, and in a \" Freudian \" slip referred to Mr. Wilson as \"Mr. smith.\" Sir Albert went one better than the Zamblans on the previous day by demanding that there should be no further \" talks about talks\" be. tween Britain and Rhodesia. In fact the Africans apper just as keen on the negative aim of *reventing a deal between Mr. Wil- son and Mr. Smith as they do on \"e Commoewo the longer term aim of bringing down the Smith rdgime. Mr. Joe Murumbi, the Vice President of Kenya, called for man- datory sanctions, although he reconised that the British economy would have to face a blow by; cutting trade with South Africa at time of economic crisis. \"Where is the morality of British pro- mises?\" he asked, implying that British policy was governed by economic factors. The Africans have studiously played down any talk of a Walk- out from the Commonwealth. However, they appear firmly -gainst signing any final com- munique which does not codtain the pledge on majority rule which they are seeking from Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson will have to decide. whether failure.to agree on a com- -muniq would be such a blow to Britis prestie as to.cause him to modify bis Rhodesia policy, in order to avert it; content- s a they an do,\" Mt. laa Smith cmmnented on th- Confermce in a- \"This Week\"- islevion.- itervilw last night. SWhen one sees conditions in theia countries, why bould we worry -bout them? \"Things have gone better than we anticipated,\" he said about saction,; \"Mr. Wilson misjudged the positin.\" He said they had sold more of thi tobacco crop than they had expected, and they were still elling. SAny reasonable man would look forward to a settlement between Rhodesia and Britain, he said. The present position was not to the advantage of Rhodesia or of Britain, but Britain was suffering more from sanctions than Rhodesia. Mr Smith hinted vaguely at the possibllty of a \"dramatic breakthrough\" in the talks with Britain, but admitted that no pro- gress had been made so far. Ith Talk Page 19",

   "text_content" : "Fromn Oun Ownh Crrespondent WASHINGTON, Sept. 8. President Jobson at laht moved today to impose some restraint on the U.S. economy b -' y - fiw-st\"a t.. w , In message sent to Congress this afternoon he requested the suspension fromd September 1 this year until January, 1968, of the 7 per cent. credit on business investment in new plant and equipment. He also recommended the suspension for the same period of the liberalised depreciation allowance on new btildings .'hich was introduced in' 1962. IFor his part, Mr. Johnson has promised to take \"strong mea- cures.\" to reduce Fedral expendi- ture Iai projects with c \"owd priority.

SThe President's message states that \" further lqher-range actions may prove necessary to preserve balanced growth and finance the defence of Vietnam., This may be taken as a threat to increase corporation and/or in. ome tax, at the time of- the J'nuary Budet, but meanwhile a Conliess cals omplted action on the eight outasandin money appro* prlations of the 19667 Budget and until the Defence Department has a cultted the probable cost of the Vietnam war during 1967. Political Package These proposals must be re. garded asa hiahly political pack. so, The Presiaent has been forced Yi the eveatsh ol reot weeks and by the approch of 'the Con. ressional ieections to erase the Impresion that ha was allowing he economic situation to drift. At the same time, he has had to face the clamour ,in Congrenu against high interest Irat and Also t1e demands for lower Govern. ment expenditure from powerful conservative cairmen of Coigres. ional committees. Mr. Jobnon ppeartohave met all these pr i=- an thbort MaRes are too little and to late. It seems doubtfu whtr t programme can have effect on interest rates. The Presi- dential message says: ' The Federal Reserve and our larger commercial banks must now recognise that we are determined to restrain infla- tionary pressures by fiscal and budgetary measures.' It accord- ingly asks the financial community to 'seize the earliest opportunity to lower interest rates and more fairly allocate the existing supplies of credit.\" Cautious Response The Federal Reserve's response, contained in a statement issued after a Board meeting this after. noon is cautious to the point of scepticism. It merely states that \" to the exent\" that these measures moderate overall demand, strains on credit will be lessened. The Board can do no more than \" con tinue to be alert to any easing of Inflationary pressure in order that monetary policy can be adjusted accordingly.\" The question remains what the economic effect of this programme will be. Mr. Johnson admitted this afternoon that ther would be little revenue effect from the suspension of the investment tax credit, and he could only list hopefully other results that might now from it.

   "text_content" : "By LEX ICr.s half-year prfits contain few surprises; they ard down from Â£56m. to Â£51ln. before tax, but the hanouncement of a second jumbo-sized loan stock was quite unexpected. The issue will be Â£60m. o.f8 per cept un- secured loan stock 1988-93 at 98, and once again shareholders will be given preferential treatment. Less Cash The last effort on these lines was a soaring success, oversubscribed 21 times, and pushed the whole prior charge,mnarket on to a lower yield basis-for. a time. Can ICI do it again? Clearly the issue is well priced in relation to the alarket at the moment. But there is a lot less cash about now than last September. Then ICI's share- . rdqtOvided t\"re-quarters of the saoneyÂ·-ssd thoie with a nice sense ,of uto-tetrm loyalty reaped the reward of a premium that touched 8+ points. If the debenture 'market is not going to seize up-and with the queue now well into the New Year a lot of other companies have a -vested interest in ICI's success- members of the public will have to take up a good slug of the issue. If they are' discouraged by the current discount on their tranche of the 7$ per cent. loan they should bear in mind that by 1969. when ICI is next likely to be back in the market, interest rates should be lower than they are now. Thus the market's initial modest opti- mism about the issue may not prove far out ' ICI needs money earlier than it budgeted simply because the short. age of profits. means cash flow is way below target. Capital expen- diture in the U.K. this yeat will be Â£142m; against depreciation of Â£60m. and Â£40m.o:os cash grants- which are no ndre than a' gleal in the finance distctor's eye for'a year or-so, However, with group profts f t to fal *urther .in A secoid ls to Â£91m. ta r the year, there itre to Pl4f1;j1t, to'9l hl sid ltbnks to payIn? a net t be funded as a result. In 1M67, capital expenditue will be back below the 1965 level, which should ease the liquidity problem for a start.

'. 'C A. See also Pat AEI At one time this year ASI climbed to 55s 6d; yesterday, oi the interim, they slid another 2s to finish at a new low point for the year of 38s. Yet, as the profits for the frst <half show the group is putting up a strong Wght against the stannation of industrial de- mand. Sales are up from Â£120.8m. to Â£130.3m. and profits before tax have dipped by only Â£280,000 to :Â£6.35m., the fall beilg partly due to higher depreciation and interest. The interim dividend is unchanged at 8 per cent. * The performance in the firsat half takes on a new shine since profits had to bear the\"exceptional et- penses of the big Ousb in telecom- munications and the costs of the cable transfer to Durham. On the other hand. the turbine division has now weathered the worst of its technical problems (and costs). For 'the year profits are again going to run out at around the Â£13%m. be- fore tax, or less. This is not dis- couraging since it implies a second half better than the Â£6.87m. year ago. It also implies earnings of around 18 per cent. and a pros- pective p/e ratio of 10% times. At times in the past the share price has made the mistake of assuaming AEl was another GEC. The product spread alone made this impossible, and if nothing else the fall to the current level has disposed of that particular fallacy. AEI's problem now is that a fifth of its business is linked to industrial demand-electric motors of various descriptions-and another quarter to the whims of the' electricity authorities. . However, in the past the group has had no compunction about hiving off its problem children, and the turbine business is an obvious candidate for the treatment. Meantime, the struggle will be an uphill one. but then that is what the 7 per cent. yield is expecting.

For in- stance, the most popular spritg barley, Proctor, which almost cer- tainly has be r o biler acreage i t te hp O any other variety in the history of British agriculture, was bred by Dr. Bell at the Plant Breeding lti- tute, Cambridge. The leadin winter wheat, Cappelle wabre in Prance. About four- of the varieties on the National, Institute of Agricultural Botany's recom- mended lists were bred overseas. Fantastic Gamble The reasons for this are not too bard to find.. Breeding a new variety takes anything from 10 to 15 years between the initial crosses and the time it is marketed. Out of the thousands of seedlings of new crosses produced each year only or so eventually go into the NIAB official trials, and of these it is rare for more than four or five at the outside to get on the recoinmended list. By the time a new variety is offered to farmers it will have cost its breeder anything from Â£20,000 to Â£50,000, and involved a fantastic gamble in the process, Up till now, and in contrast to the situation in most overseas countries, the breeder selling in the U.K. has had to rely largely on the first year's sides in which to recoup .his investment. After that any one has been free to multiply and sell seed of any new variety without restriction. The result has been that most private breeders in this country have been forced to operate on a very modest scale indeed compared with the largest Continental firms. and overseas breeders were not much interested ; In the U.K. market aturaly pr ring toita have hd largely to rely on the a efforts of the oiclal stations at si Aber h ain Wales, Pentland- a , ld 'in ot d and Stormont in s1 lis\" quits. c a revival of In toa breeding t] and varietal development work by in a number of comnmercial seed -ouses in the last fqw year. But d in the last few yearsand now with the prctPgtt of. royalties which might amount to well over Â£100.000 a year for a reall suc- cesful introduction activity is being stopped up both by firms with a long standing interest in the business and by several new- comers. Possibly the most notable pro- gramme iI being carried out by Miln's of Chester. Their spring rxley, Golden Promis, is the frst on which royalties are payable, but it it not on the recommended list and is unlikely ever to be widely rown as it is susceptible to mildew. Miles have linked up their breeding activities with another old stablished seed irm. Marstera of King's Lyrn, who introduced the winter wheat Hybrid 46 still much favoured on the most fertile sens. Continental Link The major competition for these two firms comes from Nickefsons * ofrimsby and Twyford's of Ban- ury* Nickersons pioneering the ycollaboration with Continental' * breeders which has rapidly become the Vpattern. Al the important SContinental breeders now have L agents in this country. Agency in- 0 volves very much more than just i selling. A good agent is deeply t involved in testing the foreign bred n material at a very early stage, Smakinng selections suitable for con t ditions in this country and usually y *at the same time sending materia-l * of his .own breeding for testing t overseas. e Nickersons have made quite a d large number of introductions in e recent years and some have not t been much liked by farmers. But s two harleyn they have introduced ba mati barley, has suffered a major misfortune thi . A winter wheat they ir called Perdix, which in trials bi.meraged 3 to 4 cwis an acre better thtan Cappelle. has suddenly succumbed to a new race of yellow rust. Previously k has shown outstanding resistance to this disease. Probably only one crop in 10 of Perdix has been hit this season, but the risk is that next year the proportion will be much higher and few farmers will dare-to grow it. Disease Risk This is the sort of hazard plant breeders grow philosophical about. Disease resistance is to-day the y- number one objective for every plant breeder for this provides the most certain road to high yields and as more and more cereals are grown so the risk of disease be- comes more serious. For instance. mildew is now thought to be responsible for yield losses that may average anything from 5 to 20 per cent. of the potential depending n on the season. Inbred resistance to mildew is now a sine qua non for any new variety of barley whose breeder hopes to get it on to the recommended list. Unfor- tunately, it seems that breeding for complete resistance is not practical. as new races of the pathogen evolve, so the emphasis is now shifting towards producing types which tolerate the disease with the least possible loss of yield instead. Now that private breeding activity is becoming so much more intensive the question of what i' the future role of the official plant breeding stations should be is being raised. The suggestion one hears is that in future they should concentrate their efforts on the more fundamental aspects, on the basic genetical work which promises the biggest gains in the ong run it which no private breeder can afford to carry out. This would mean the official stations handing over useful material for the private breeders to develop into commercial varieties. This is the pattern in Holland and elsewhere, but it still seems a long way off over here.",

A CONTROVERSIAL scheme by which the U.S. Government will pay what amounts to a subsidy to poor families so that they can live in decent housing became a reality last niaht when President Johnson signed into law a Bill which gives S22m. to \"rent supplement\" programme. The President could not have been warmer in his comments on signing the Bill: \"I have waited for this moment for 35 years,\" he said, and \"no single Bill has given me reater pleasure.\" He termed it \"the single most important breakthrough in history of housing.\" As a result 53,000 families would be guaranteed \"a rain-proof roof and a rat-proof bedroom.\" If Congress appropriated all the money he was oing to request, the Admlnistration would have $150m. to spend on the programme during the next four years. The scheme was authorised by Congress last year after some of the most acrimoiious debates of the 1965 session. Tis.April Conigress gave the Administration S12m. to start the pro- gramme, but until this appropriation was increased to its current S22m. last month the future of the scheme remained in doubt. In effect the Government will subsidise poor WASHINGTON, Sept 8. ramilies who live in decent housing Tenants will have to pay 25 per cent. of their income as rent and the balance between their contribution and the \"economic rent\" will'bepro :ided by the Government. payments will be made not to the tenants but to sponsor.owners of housing projects-which are strlty liited to one of three schemes: non-profit organisation, a co-operative or a \" limited dividend corporation\" \"here return on capital is restricted by law to not more than 6 per cent. The exact standards of eligibility have been a cause of constant conflict on Capitol Hill. Originally t-h Administration wanted many families or moderate income to be included but under strong pressure firom ipponents of the scheme a cor- promise was agreed whereby only families whose income was low enough to make them eligible for public housing would be included.",

Prince Edward bl d Quebec turfed out their lin pars and the Progressive vve Government o hMani toba's'Premier, Mr. Duff Roblin, slipped berL in with a greatly re duced majority. But nobody is looking for au upset In British Columbia. The conservative Social Credit Party is as firmly entrenched there as i is in Alberta. In the last election the Government easily won a fifth term, capturing 33 of the 52 seats, *with the New Democratic Party winnin 14 and the Liberals five. (This tune there will be 55 seat., the result of an electoral distribu- tion this spring which added three ridings and reduced the dispropor. tionate weight of the rural vote.) Cat-and-mouse Characteristically, Mr. Bennett played a cat-and-mouse game with the electorate, prompting an election-date guessing game that began as long ago as January dn culminated m a. hurriedlycaled Press conference in a downtown Vancouver hotel a few weeks ago, when he made the September 12 date official There were several factors which finally determined his decision to go to the polls now. In general terms, the brimming prosperity of British Columbia and its apparent continued enthusiasm for. the Social Credit Government pro. duced a favourable climate for a 1966 election. But this summer's lumber dispute controlled the timing. Nothing could be done until peace was assured-and on terms which found favour with a very important section of 'the electorate. Mr. Bennett and Mr. Leslie Peterson. the Labour Minister, were instrumental in shaping the two-year contract, which the em- ploycrs decried as far too exper- sive but dispiritedly accepted.

And there appeag'to b no sign that the province's eco- nomic prosperity will suffer a major setback in the near future. The Progressive Conservatives have not been a factor in BC politics for several years-they are seatless and have been leaderless since the former Justice Minister, Mr. Davie Fulton, returned to Federal politics after a futile attempt to crack the Bennett regime in 1963. The Liberals are led by an advertising and public relations executive, Mr. Raymond Perrault, whose efforts since he was elected in the 1960 election have produced little more than frustra- tion for him and his followers.

In the fist place, bieJ ointed to the electoral redistribui' tion, contending that the voters had\"i the right to an election under the ' new arrangement as quickly as po- -ible. B='ides, he aid, in a demo- cracy the Government should seek' a fresh mandate every three years *i or so, even if the legal maximum a term was much longer. He also xpressed reluctance to wait until next year for another reason-it would clutter ip Canada's centen*s s. nia-l*brations and he wanted to ,spand nore time in 1967 working on behalf of Canadlia unity.

He alleged that it was the Federal Government's fault, not his, that the country was t eni .,ul p.r sevInq , ! uy.. The tradition parties haI fa~led miserably to provide the nlecIsary leadership and had failed to 'recognise the need for non- partisanship in meeting the coun- try's needs. That, implied Mr. Bennett, was the secret of his and Social Credit's success in British Columbia; the party had embraced people of various political persuasions who were more interested in service than in politics.

The Divided The final audited results are better than tore- cast in February, but in the light of present-conditions the Directors do not recommend a further ordinary dividend beyond the two nterims (amounting to 8% together), whfh have already been declared and paid. Esport A common selling organisation was set up last year under the name of Crittal-Hope Export, and the overseas representatives and selling agents of the two companies have been combined into an integrated whole. We exported 11% of the production of our main English factories, and we obtained orders in 86 different countries. FPale Parosuds: Today the future is more than ever clouded by the recent U.K. Government measures to deflate the economy. I am glad to see that no brake is to be put on hospitals, schools or Local Authority housing, all of which are of paramount importance to our window-making companies, but the extent by which other construction, both Government and private, is likely to be restricted is imposible to assess from the statementreleased so far. In the long term I feel confident that the construction industry. on which the prosperity of your Company so largely depends, is bound to move forward again through the sheer weight of national. demand. The timing and pace of advance are hard to gauge, but we are well equipped to play our part in the advance when it comes. Similarly, the men and money that we have been putting into our overseas companies for many years is bearing good fruit and I feel that they are well placed to take full advantage of the opportunities which lie before them. .

In my Review last year, I'stated that the three main factors to be taken into account in assessing the outlook for the future were taxa- tion, the Rent Bill and general economic conditions. These factors are still operative. As respects taxation, all the Group's profits will be liable to Corporation Tax. We have been advsed that under the televant statutory provisions as they now stand, the Company will be en- titled to retain the income tax deducted from the whole of the Preference dividend for the current year and that a substantial balance of relief will be available in respect of the Ordinary dividend. The new Selective. Employment Tax, coming into effect in September, will cost us an estimated Â£7,500 this year ahd Â£15,000 in a full year on the basis of our present personnel. The 1965 Rent Act has come into operation since my last review. The number of applica- tions to determine rents so far made is small in proportion to the total number of our properties affected. There is not .yet suffi- cient inf6rtnation to enable us to make an assessment of the likely outcome so far as concerns the Group. We are satisfied that the rents we charge for our residential properties are fair and reasonable. Although the task before your Directors will not be easy, they are nevertheless confident, barring un- foreseen circumstances or any material change in conditions, of their ability to maintain the present rate of dividend (i.e. 18 per cent.).on the Ordinary Capital for the current year.",

I - , - 1 rAKiM, sept. 5. THE BRITISH Government to-day explained and defended its plan to cut about Â£30m. a year from the foreign exchange costs of its troops in Germany before its NATO allies in the Annual Review Committee. The plan falls broadly into three parts. First, the Government in- tends to recoup between Â£5m.Â£8m. by channelling purchases by British Forces into the Sterling Area. Another Â£15m. is then to be saved by changes in the logistical system, which essentially amounts to running-down military stores from their present 30-day level to one adequate for a 10-day war. Finally, on the assumption that the current round of Anglo-German talks on offset arrangements leave another Â£10m. uncovered, it is proposed to cut back on the number of forces kept in Germany. Three possible kinds of reduction have been proposed to the Allies, and thp U.K. is interested to learn their preference. As expected, a number of member countries criticised the British position on the grounds that it would have been more fitting for the U.K. to reduce her military commitments East of Suez instead of in Europe. There were also doubts about the logistical chatiges. A further point is that by gong back on her military commitments in the Alliance'it this way, the U.K. only weakens the position of the 14 in their tussle with General de Gaulle over the withdrawal of French Forces.",

Rankovic affair The so-called Rankovic affair was neither a purge on the pattern of the Stalin erar nor a mere power. struggle for .the succession of Marshal Tito. In the words of Mr. Krsto Crvenkovski, one of the ablest Yugoslav leaders, \"in our case it is not a question of con- centration camps, staged trials, the liquidation of revolutionaries .and honest citizens, or similar methods known from the past of certain countries, but is a question of crushing certain bureaucratic- conservative forces within the League of Communists, in its leadership and in society in general, the forces which in one way or other opposed the country's democratic development.\" To put it bluntly, the future of the economic reforms, the process of liberplisation and not the least the Federal State of six republics was at stake. How can the dynamic develop- ment of a decentralised market economy- i,\" 'papitalism without capitalists \"- ned with a nII do a thl mr de Ihi wi so in th pr ~J1 ad a of me th eel se th to so RI m or wl de cr; 45 wl m ill as th Mr. A. Rankovr where the leadership publicly admits that the Party has become a brake instead of an \"engine\" of economic and social devlop- ment. As Mr. Mijalko Todorovic, the successor of Mr. Rankovic as secretary of the central committee, put it: \"From top to bottom the Party organs should divest them- selves of executive functions. If the League of Communists wants to take the lead in reforming society, it must reform itself in this phase.\" Thus, the demotion of Mr. Rankovic and the dismissal of many high security officials mean only the beginning of. a process which should lead from economic decentralisation to political demo- cratisation. Mr. Crvenkovski, the 45-year-old leader of Macedonia, who was the chairman of the com- mission which investigated the illegal activities of Mr. Rankovic andl his closest associates, holds that' the Party. should be con- sin party system In wmVl aoaual dc!ion-makib is in thel binds of a Communist ierachy?, .This ks th-e .n'of t mattr..

The second mission, which is specialising in heavier goods, will spend between five and six weeks in the area and besides trylag to carve out new markets will also be studying the possibilities for technical co-operation between French companies and local firms. Although France at present has a positive trade balance with the I Caribbean, the Foreign Trade Centre Journal argues that this is due more to a low level of imports than to impressive sales. In 1955 French exports to the area were worth S1m. or scarcely 1 per cent. of its total imports. They mostl comrised cars, perfumes. plywoo steer, wines and watches. The Foreign Trade Journal goes on to point out that the Caribbean has few transforming industries of its own, and has traditionally been content to rely on imports for a very wide range of needs.",

HARD NEGOTIATIONS over Indonesia's. commercial debt to Briitain;,estimated at Â£13m., have been defrred untif the meeting in Tokyo on September 19 of her ten main dreditors'-known as the \"Tokyo Club.\" This'was decided yesterday at ttalks in London be- twen'. the lidonesian mission, led by the: Sultan Buwono IX. and Foreign Office officials. Thus, the future *of the UX.K. Â£13m.-which is only a fraction of liabilities that may amount to over Â£1,000m.-will be discussed within the wider context of the repbasing of Indonesia's payments. In Tokyo, it is hoped to reach a consensus over deferment of Indonesia's repayments in return for reassurances on her economic rehabilitation.

Our Tokyo Conrpodeait writes: Finance o cials in the Japanese Government expect that Indonesia will have to agree to a settlement of approximately SlOO1n. owed to the IMF and rescheduling of the huge foreign debt when the Tokyo Club meets. Indonesia's foreign debts total an estimated S2.400mni.-S2,900m. (Â£820m.- Â£l1,000m.). About $SS30m. of this total amount is due this year. It is ex- pected that the nation's foreign ex- change earnings in 1966 will amount to only, 400m. Her representatives to the consortium meeting will prob- ably renew .their bid for \" emer- gency\" financial aid, perhaps as much as 00m. or more. Informed observers do not think the Tokyo Club will discuss possible new loans to assist Indonesia during the September meeting.",

Spanner-throwing Operation Secondly, to Malaysians it seems that, subsequent to. July 5, Siinga pore mounted another of its spanner-throwing operations-the most notorious of which was the additional demands which caused the 24-hour delay in signing the London Agreement in 1963 from which Lee Kuan Yew gained so little and lost so much in terms of, alienating. Kuala Lumpur. So, too, on this occasion; without going into the details, Singapore was essentially seeking additional guar- antees con'erning the protection of its reserves. As it was, the July 5 agreement provided for a Deputy Governor of the Bank Negara, Malaysia, to control and operate Singapore's separate accounts and assets, and for the Singapore re- serves to be held at his direction, under an irrevocable letter of in- struction from the Governor of the Bank Negara to the Bank of England and other depositaries. The Bank Negara would have remained the overall legal entity, but even though the Governor's and - the Bank's powers were heavily circumscribed Singapore played Oliver Twist in asking for more. It is arguable that Malaysia having already \"leant AR - of - escalation asod PAIR tactic of escalation and P b it tt te w w h a s1 tt p re B1 a P a te Ic P fe ti a Tan Slew Sin brinkmanship. And so this time it allowed Singapore to go over the edge. Tan Siew Sin undoub- tedly has a point when he argues that rather than seek an agreement with absolute gaarantees that it will not be. broken it is better to have no agreement at all. Thirdly, the fact that Singapore made additional demands of sub- stance rather than of detail, after the negotiations concluded, was for political more than economic reasons. Singapore has not dis- guised the fact that it was seeking additional gdarantees against the possible emergence of a govern- ment in Malaysia which would act towards Singapore mutch as India looked like behaving towards Pakistan before Gandhi's fast forced Delhi's hand on the appor- tionment of foreign exchange reserves. nd ne lu tbÂ· lee mt it to Ire Ib- Irr 'or lic lisÂ· lct lia ds Ist JrÂ· ge These feart an 1at, if'uire alistic, and irrelevant when compared with the overwhelming advaitage .of retaining the currency l .aaQuit ' apart from the fact that it is h ly unlikely that either the Bank Negara or any Malaysian Govor- ment would be so its international sta d, tb Malay \"ultras\" are VLp1y'o6t the \" Mad mullahbs \" thte jPP hagis ,tbem to be. It has to be admitted that in the context of the prevlling, largely negative, political attitudes the currency break is understand- able if not, as some-would have it, inevable. Termination of the Pan-Malaysian (inchldingABrunei) c oreney fl6low naturally upos the post-separation creation of two political sovereignties which, in the final analysis, neither side wishes to limit in favour of the other. Since separation, the Singapore leaders have contnually asserted that Malaysia does not accept de facto their de lure inde- upndence. Apparently they are unconcerned that the assertion of that independence will lead to Singapore's isolation from its natural hinterland. Whole complex web in melting pot Similarly it must be noted that the Malaysian Alliance leaders chose to reflect relief that the agreement was ot signed, rather than sorrow. At the heart of the. political antipathy between the two parties lies the PAP conviction that they can \"go it alone\" to advantage, while the Alliance belief is that Singapore needs Malaysia more than Malaysia needs Singapore. Consequently nationalism has once more divided what, in hard economic terms, is best seen as indivisible. The failure to retain the common dollar may be \"logical\" in political terms, but, as far as the acceleration or even retention of present economic growth-rates are concerned, it is highly undesirable. It throws into the melting pot the whole, com- plex, web of Malaysian-Singapore trade, business and financial ties which has been woven ovet the last century. For one thing it seems unlike'y thl wi Ch th me ca us cu Vt to ot dc th th ui to th sec m; in lai ca PC Sil re se P< m th lc, fe aÂ£ it su Lee Kwan Yew the two economies is more resilient than at present seems likely (or, unless purposeful steps are taken to restore it which is also unlikely) the economic logic of the situation seems to call for a far greater marshalling of domestic resources in Malaysia, and much more laissez-faire in Singapore. Ironi- cally, this would go against the political grain in both countries. In short, when Malaysia and Singapore issue their separate cur- rencies on June 12, 1967, economic separation will have followed political separation-barring a miracle of reconciliation for which there is now no evidence. Both leaderships are making brave pro- festions of their respective \"viability\" but, in the immediate afternmiath of the currency break, it is very difficult to feel even that sure,; ''It -- that the co iuno bWt . will endure.

Wducati6nal expenditure has tripled in Bri. tain over the past 10 years and it will triple again by 1980, under present plans, at which time it will represent some fÂ£1OO00m, or 10 per cent. of GNP. Britain will surely follow the patter of the U.S., where the fburgeofing college population- California alone has double Britain's number of pdst-sehool students-now provides the most important mirket for all types of serious books.

Pergamnon, established after the war cono ceptrated on scientific -soft* backs,\" and on the automation of invoicing, shipping and ware- housing, to such effect that the house has bad one of the most remarkable growth records of any publisher. Maxwell's books are by no means cheap-he has been known to sell a soft cover at a higher price than the original hardback-but by publishing a vast amount of technical books, the overall sales have been high. A competitor not unkindly described Makwell as the Henry Ford of publishing but he has been more astute than Ford in Iodbkin to his markets. Max- well regards publishing as an international business, sending. 85 per cent. of his sales over- seas and retaining more Ameri- can authors than British. Last year he bought Vieweg. an established German publisher, as a prelude to eventual simul* taneous publication .in the main ~ ' (Â· i I be the certainy be tu of the , is o o this.

Thsw are sodie of the ideas with which IPC is toying. and Richard Fisher who .was tempted from the American *McGraw Hill to run Lord Thomsona' Noonday may be expected to follow the same path. Fisher is a quiet spoken, cholarly American who really comes to life when discussing the exciting things that he feels will happen ip publishing. He is likely to be an important in- fluence over here, and not just because of his financial back* ing. Fisher is enthusiastic about the prospects of programmed books, a teaching method of trial and error developed at Harvard. Noonday which will eventually. cover ibe spectrum of paperback publishing, with a target of IS-20 new titles' a month, will try several new *approaches to marketing, such as direct selling to teahers, and the mail order selling of home study books. Marketing' book is not as simple as selling soap. It is important tO build a corporate image of quality. at which Penguin among paperback houses has beep outstandingly * successful, but it is diicult to reconcile this brand imkge. with Robert Maxwell the business to concentrate Ot s what its editor Tony Oodwine. feels is the more stable and eventually more profitable course of selecting good.wtiing. Out and out marketing of books is at present btnpeRd by the conditions of the Net Book agreement, a practice, which ensures that all oitleta should sell a book for the same price, libraries alone gllatg a discount of 10 per cent With the ending of RPM, this agree. meat has come under fire, and Maxwell, a confirmed opponenta hopes to table a measure in Parliament to remove it within two years. The agreement is the cause of acrimonious dispute amongst publishers and book- sellers, who will not let it go without a fight. Whatever the outcome on price maintenance, there is no doubt that book publishing in the next few years will be a most fascinating occupation. It will see growing competition among the newspaper and tele- vision kings, and between some of the shrewdest men in British business. If book sales double in the next five to six years, as some publishers suggest, there' should be room for all of them; but with teaching machines, and link ups with television, such as the recent ATV.Hamlyn plan to market dompatible teaching' kits, publishing 'ma not be.. quite the saie at the end of those five earsas at is to-day.

If uncontrolled, th result is an explosion. If coo trolled, it is a source of usabl energy of greater power-'t weight iatio than ever knovw before (theoretically 3m. time that of *coal). The controlil form is a nuclear reactor. The first purpose of all th early nuclear work was to br duce a: bomb, and associateI *ith this' wis a lot of new tect ,nology, kept very secret. But .was the controlled form. th reactor, that really started th I industry-for what has come t be called the peaceful uses o atomic energy, the title of th three Geneva international con ferences since 1958. First Reactors The first reactor was built b, Enrico Fermi in Chicago an operated in December. 194: The first in Europe was Britain' GLEEP at Harwell, whic started up in August, 1947, ani is still working over 19 year later for some 150 hours or si a week. Though the fundamental di: coveries'of early nucleonics cam from Europe, including Britair the first massive work was in th U.S. Industrialists there saw th possibilities at once and tried t keep the know-how to then selves; Britain had thus to stat almost from, scratch. Russia realising the importance of th bomb, Was soon at work, thoug it then had no comparabl nuclear physics school. So, if the term \"nucler power\" meaps the bomb, the the U.S., Russia and Britain wei for some time the only nucle powers. France has since bee catching up. and China is in th field. There is little-except th immense cost-to prevent oth- riations from doing the sam now. However, the bomb no goes into, the background . technology and it is the reacto that counts and has brought s many nations into the nucles field. Massive Problem The massive fundamenti problem, bringing in its trai hundreds of other problems, how to make efficient use of t; energy released during fissiot This is in three forms: the hei created when fission partici- shoot into neighbouring meta the radioactivity created durin fission and by the bombairmoi of naiibbouring atoms; and ti additional neutrons to sustal the reaction. The most important for it dustry is the heat. And as th most flexible source of snear for general use Is electricity, the first paceful uIse1f iad8 fission energy appeared to be t design a power station in whi-- the reactor heat would be us: in the same way is the hei from burning coal or oil t generate steam for turb- alternators. T' To o this posed two mal probl s. The first was to sl\" dbwf ia n flutrl'onr Io as to mmik RtiA \" AL \"I6 6 Â·Â·, ~ IY;:~:;~~Hi:.:~bt;j larsRK 'i e NUCLEX, the international exhibition which opened yee4a, In Ba*e, witzerlad, is the first devoted exclusively to the nuclear industry. There are 250 exhibiteor frmn 16 countres. The British section, which includes the stands of the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority and the industrial concerns grouped in the British Nuclear Forum, is one of the largest. the best use of the fissile material. The answer was a \"moderator,\" by which, the fission neutrons would be bounced off light atoms so that they lost energy. Graphite or Water What light materials? Fermi's answer was graphite. So was that of Britain's atomic scientists. Other materials have been tried, some successfully. For instance, water is the cheapest and most efficient moderator known, but it also absorbs neutrons and at high temperatures is a very corrosive fluid. Heavy water, though as a moderator not quite as good, absorbs far fewer neutrons. The second problem was how to transfer the heat. The answer -to pass a fluid-the coolant- over it. What fluid? The British answer in its first stations is carbon dioxide under pres- sure. One successful Aeipni answer is water. But wfat hap' pens to such fluids whmr heated and bombarded by' radi- activity'? And what happens to graphite when to boa bal-ed at high tIoperatur.? W Wknpw now- tt .in .fact/ *biI changes its size, a fact that led to Ume-consuming delays in orly British nulear power aThusproblio after problem arose-for nobody had ever built a nuclear power station- brining in metallurgist, chemsts. physicists, mathema- ticians, and meohaoical, civil, electrical, electronic and mining engineers, with a whole lot of fringe manufacturers who had specialised in crtain products, such as, to lgve merely a couple of examples, Avica Equipment, which knew a great deal aboui piping and ducting, and Strachan and Henshaw for the specialised handling of nucleas fuels. All thit has been said so fai applies to the so-called \"slow' type of power station utilising a moderator. Concomitant with the development of this has been work on \"fast\" reacton using pure U235 or plutonium, with no moderator and liquid sodium as the coolant. The U.K. model is the Dounrea) establishment on the north Scot- tish coast, .and a commercial prototype is being designed. With the growth of the fast . ' . - * ;. . , reactor has come the possibility t of breeding more fissile fuel I by making use of spare s neutrons, . a concept also r examined for \"slow\" reactors, making the \"converter\" notion r one for the future. The fast * .reactor has brought with. it an attractive concept of making i plutonium in the slow reactors s and using 'it in the fast ones, a thus making a self-contained , nuclear power station system of i great economy in fuel. , e Britain has' blt nuiclear power Sstations tha't have contributed - re electricity than those of I aPy other country. Calder Hall was followed by the chain of so- t called Magnpx stations based on its design. Calder Hall has done 10 years' valiant work with no sign of ageing, and all the stations have yielded more than designed for. But they are ex- pensive to build and most suit- able for base-load high-output work. The later development, the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor, with its cunningly designed fuel enabling much more energy to come from each- atom, has broken through the cost barrier and is the new type being used for Dungeness B station. In the U.S., water-moderated, water- cooled reactors have done the same thing-though the econo- mics of nuclear stations need to be elatrin.4 very carefuny's i Tand t*e ar tl a W.,4 of reactor to on nhteu-di genppel tho earlier dWIrWt, eseially -obvious la the w its i private enterprise d velopment moving along dsme- what different lines from Bitain with its three consortia, is likely to be reduced. t ' Power stations, the most obvious application of nuclear energy, are not all. With the rise of the nuclear industry has come a great demand for instru- mentation of every kind and every degree of sophistication The manufacture of geiget coun- ters and others to measure radio- activity has spun off into elec- tronic counters of many sorts. CoMhputers have developed at the same time, with applica-1 tions in nucleonics. Recorders, neutron-activators, mass spectro- meters-the list is seemingly endless. Automation for remote control should not be forgotten in this connection, nor such a thing as aerial surveying depend- ing on natural radioactivity for prospecting techniques.

The advance which the AGR represents was made possible by the very satisfactory berform- ance, of the Widijcale proto- type and by the steady teliability of nuclear power stations which have, how generated almost 60,000m. kWh. Yet the necessary technical iinprovements could not have been made without , a comprehensive development programme going back to 1957 and including intensive irradia- tion ex 1rin*nts in the Wind- scale prototype. Constant inter. action between operating experi- ence of a reactor system and a bread programme aimed at 4 improving the design has < characterised our approach in i Britain, and it is on this basis that we predict further economic I imnrovements in the AOR. The need for early and crucial I decisions in the development of I a new technoloigy is illustrated I reactor system. Even with the more thn one basc c types. t ;i , t!- * ;Ml q\" However, the Authority has in recent year been able to devote someefort to the development of water. reactors, and at Winfrith a protQtype Steam oenerstlng Heavy Water Reac- tor (SGHWR) should be on power in 1968. We are confl. dent that, using either, slightly enriched or natural uranium, the SGHWR can provide a conmeti- tive source of power over a range of power stAtion outputs and 6perating conditions, particularly in export markets. Dragon Project Britain has also played a major role in the Dragon project, a collaborative venture under OECD. This high-temperature reactor hat for some time now been operating at full design power, and first estimates suggest that in production sizes it could possibly have prospects as a coimmerial reactor of the con- verter type. It is, however, clear that any reactor type which now makes a successful etry into the world market sot nucltar power must show extremely attractive commercial characteristics to compete with already established systems. At present the Authority's major development effort is con. centrated on the fast breeder reactor. The results achieved by the Dounreay experimental fast reactor (DFR) led the Authority, to seek Government approval earlier this year for the construc- tion of a Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR). Work is now going ahead at Dounreay on this project. We believe that fast reactors based on the plutonium pro- duced by the thernadl neutron A eerul vilw 0l- thi Advnced Gumo d liactor at Wted\"le showlIg the ndalambiuaE-ci eo eaauat bualln. power stations w operating or. under constru ctn. can operate at substantially wer. fuel costs than any other stem and can compete in cai) cost with any contemporary a vanced systerm. Moreover, the reactor makes possible a a tial improve- ment in ur utilisation.

Britain is at the moment the acknowledged leader in the field of fast reaetor development, but it is certain that in the pursuit of yet cheaper sources of power, that lead will come under severe pressure from other countries mounting concentrated tech- nological programmes. The time taken between the technical proving of a reactor system and its commercial exploitation will inevitably be reduced in the present formidable competition for world markets, and this trend is intensified by the economic advantages of largerreactors and of series production. Scale Economies The decisioir to undertake iL major nuiclear power programme has brought Britain a very con- siderable expertise in other areas, particularly in the manufacture and reprocessing of nuclear fuels. An advanced technological sition again ensures the nefits of economies of scale and the ability to offer a highly competitive ;9nplete fuel cycle service to potial customers abroad. Prom the same basis of a br6adly bas6d research tro grnmme, thk Authority, in collaboration with the Ministry of Techn616gy, with industry aid the universities, is pursuing ' a progrAmme of desalination studies aimed at combining a flash distillation desalinailon plant with a nuclear power reactor. Other similar non- nuclear assignments in applied research and development ire hoped for in the future,. The wider applicAtion of' radioisotopes in industry, medicine and agriculture could also increase the already vtry significant market which has been established in this country and abroad and bring benefits both to the producer and the user from the development work already done. The Advantages. The British achievement in nuclear power is not limited to the development of successful nuclear power reactors. Within that field, however, the practic- ability of safe and efficient generation of electricity by nuclear power has been accepted only 25 years after the building of the world's first nuclear pile. The advantages over alterna- tive fuels for base-load genera- tion have been established and will be ever more convincingly prdved in the rapid expansion of world electricity demand which * is foreseen. Technological de- velopment has rapidly given place to commercial exploita- tion, and already this is coupled with a need to conserve and inake maximum use of the world's natural fuel resources by the development of the fast breeder teaotor. and,, for the more distint futiteo, possibly of the fusl,'ireactor.

To sustaln the Capen. urst 'plant in operation it is necessary to purchase and process uranium ore to provide uranium' hexafluoride, wch is the feed material to the diffusion process. At Springflelds near Preston, the Group operates what is prObably the larest nucleat fuel factory .n4tm world.

   "text_content" : "41DEY. UWiq -PNST R Â·Â· ,airss0 r ait ion major consideration of the de- signer. To-day the AGR (Ad- vanced OGascooled Reactor) can claim to be the safest of all reactor systems. It is backed up by ten years perating expen- ence of the earler stations with comzponents of greater physical size and by the Windscale AGR, the prototype for those features which differentiate the AGR from' previous gas-cooled re- actbor. The AGR gives the low- est generation cost and has high development potential. U.S. Advances In the U.S. big advances -have been made particularly in the size of reactor, and capital costs have reduded rapidly. Indeed, it is now claimed for the water reactor stations that station capital cost is lower than for conventional stations. However, even though boiling water reactors with outputs of 1,100 MW are now on order in the U.S. the maximum size proeently in operation is that at Dresden, commissioned in June, 1960, which generates 200 MW. There is therefore a very con- siderable extrapolation involving new techniques and diffetent methods of engineering. This contrasts markedly with the steady advance in Britain with leertation now amounting What dthebeore can beprctd for the next ten years? Cost Factor The prime aim of the designer is to reduce the capital cost of the station without reducing the safety standards. This is o im- portance both at home and abroad with capital in short supply and hence high interest rates. Even though the present worth method forms the best basis for comparfsot of generaf tion cost and shows the advan- tage of the AGR system with its low fuel cy9le cost, the initial capital has to be found. A reduction of 20 per cent. is the immediate aim. A part of this reduction will undoubtedly result from the present attitude of the CEGB to the station specification. Vic- torian structures have given way to modern materials and methods, a different attitude to crapage and laydown areas for the infrequent, indeed unlikely, maintenance operations, while construction times must be re- duced, thus making the Invested capital give an earlier return. The actual standard of the speci- fication will be attuned to modern conditions and the present rapid rate of techno- logical progress. The station is regarded as a slinle unit with cowa to siauo ossu lueneW and nuclear. It will, however, have the greatest impact on the nuclear station because 6f its higher capital costs. In some areas new thought is required to meet modern technological re- quirements, for example, com- puterised control of the station. Improvement in engineering de- sign is still possible and further cost reduction will accrue. This is particularly relevant to those areas where application of tech- sology is relatively new in the nuclear field, for example, the concrete pressure vessel. Inevitable Conflict There is the inevitable conilict between advance in parameteri and the considerable savings re- sulting from replication foremost among which is the spreading of design cost. However, replication more than any other factor leads to reliability and high avail- ability stemming from actual operation experience of theplant. Calculations of generation costs and comparative exercises with other systems based on antici- pated operating conditions and therefore hypothetical ground rules can be justified ultimately only by operating experience on Ifbin tol aid inteirated. *Wfit rt b- it' a t h o uft o uw t i t se i 30 y\\em: As Ã½out reduction in as, fossil fuelled t will, however, It impact on the beeause 6f its ;ostsIn S~~iome ot is required to echoological re; example, colll. 1 of the station. engineering de- .ibie and further 'ill-accrue.

Strict Criteria At the present time, of all reactor systems, the AGR alone cah meet the trict safety criteria for siting c ose to urban areas. In Britain, where distapces are small this aspect could be worth as much as Â£10/kW on differedn tial total capital costs between two systems on different sites. In addition, the nulear station has the advantage of cleanlilnes iwith no coal yards, rail sidings, noxious effluent or ash disposal problems. There has been a steady fall in capital costs since 1956. Now there is a step change and there will be A further steady reduction until increase in size to 1,200 MW or thereabouts brings about a further step. I predict that for stations built in Britain the present tender price of Â£63/kW for a 2 x 600 MW station will bI the Bnw rprocemaeg pln t t Wicle tbe pbuitoMiW m cemUigtw of Isrndatd m.aox fuol is extractd and cowertdl to platoent oxide for aMe a the marnufac. tuw of plutonmh/aralaum fael elements for adviah ed rescter syitem&.

Since these figures will be accompanied by a reduction in CEGB charges and in the interest during construction while highbr rating will result in lower fuel costs the total capital costs will reduce to give a generation cost below 0.40 pos- sibly to 0.38d/kWh on present ground rules of 75 per cent. load factor and 20 years amortisation with 7.5 por cent. discount rate for investmbnt The correspond- ing figures for 85 per cent. and 25 years are below 0.34d possibly to 0.32d/kWh. Change. in Concept Further development will give further change in concept as rat- ing increases and hence core size decreases. Already the Atomic Energy Authority is. testing fuel to much higher rating than is currently under commercial con- sideration. Fuel pins of smaller diameter' and in clusters of greater number will be the first step. Enrichment will increase because of the greater surface area, but there will be a lower capital cost 'of some Â£5 per kW and a net reduction in generation cost. Dispersed fuels in which utaniumn as a carbide is set in a matrix of silicon carbide, an Arrangment which retains the gaseous fission products pro- duced by irradiation, are not only under - development but have been irradiated to burn ups of 40,000 MWD/te with quite satisfactory results. The develop- ment of the fuel to meet the requirements of a commercial station are now under way but this will take some little time. As temperatures advance the technologies of the AGR and the HTR become closely aligned, the major differences being in the choice of coolant, carbon dioxide on the one hand., helium on the other. The t'faton re- actor has now bena m operation over six months-it is not a power producer but is experi- mental and designed to test the feasibility of the concept in Which the moderator is integral with the. fuel and Ji removed and tenewed' with it Consider- able interest is being, shown abrahl in this general concept; There are different. versioni giving markedly different designs ;ina the, ;VS.A. the Peach Bottom reactor is similar to Dragon while in Germany the Pebble Bed reactor at Julich hear DussCiddrf ha's just achieved criticality. These developments are being followed with keen interest. The nuclear reactor is now the most economical power pro- ducer for Britain-we cannot afford to be without it and an increasing percentage of our generating capability consistent with the national economy must be directed this way. rj",

It considers the Ministry migt well have taken a more critical attitude in examining this, and in particular should have checked the cost against figures of charges made to civilian rustomers. Guided Missiles Commenting on the cost of the British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2, he Committee says whereas in 1959 the development cost had been set at 830m.-Â£90m, this had risen to Â£137m. v 1962. and rose further to Â£240m.- 20m. by arly 1964. By the time he project was cancelled, Â£125m. had been paid to contractors, and further payments were expected to amount to about Â£70m. While accepting that TSR-2 was an advanced aircraft of great complexity it considers that all concerned were at fault in not securing the earlier introduction of an adequatq system of recording and reporting costs against physical progress to enable policy decisions to be taken on the basis of up-to-date information.

   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Reporter Manufacturing industry began cutting back capital spending and reducing stocks in the second quarter of this year, according to official estimates released to-day by the Board of Trade. investment by manulacturers is ,rovisionally estimated to have lcclined by about 7 per cent. be- ween the first and second quarters If 1966. Spending by distributors and service industry generally ihowed no change. Taking the overall level for the Irst half year, capital spending in manufacturing was about 11 per ;ent. below the second half of 1965. Between the first and second quarters, manufacturers reduced their fixed capital expenditure (at 1958 prices, seasonally adjusted) from Â£300m. to Â£279m. Distribu- tion and service industry recorded E284m., the same as the first quarter. The provisional estimates for the second quarter show that all indus- try's capital spending was about r cent. below its first quarter The total of Â£562m. spent re Betd a tall of Â£4 n building tk the lowest level for two Sand a . asdne in plant C ripen4r.

Within the overall total fall of Â£5m. in the second quarter against the first, decreases for manufacturing (Â£llm.) and wholesalers (Â£22m.), were almost balanced by an increase in retailers' stocks (up Â£28m. and the highest rise for over two years). Behind the total fall in manufao- turers' stocks for the first time for nearly three years there were diverse movements in assets. Stocks of materials and fuel de- creased by 150m., the sharpest quA- terly decline in volume recorded for several years and perhaps probably explained in part by the seamen's strike as well as the run-down in wholesalers' stocks. By contrast, there was an unusually hia rise-Â£41m.- in manufacturer's a holdings of finished Soods. The recentlv reported fall in the production index was greater than the decline in stocks held by manufac- turera.

Improvement to Check Valves Check valves using a neo- prene ball are said by the Do Laval Separator Company, of Poughkeepsie, New York, to open on light pressure and give an unobstructed forward flow. The valve is mounted hori- zontally and gravity pulls the ball down into the path of any counter-flow.

The Big Factor This striking upsurge in Fund ctivity invoin the smaller countries of the world is no doubt partly explained by the increase in the mnniber of members in this class produced by tse recruitment of many newlyindeendent States in the 1960's It can aso be set down in some measure to the fact that the liberalisation of Fund lend- ii% procedures hat combined with other factors to produce a greater readiness among .small countries than there was earlier on to seek 'ts assistance in coping with minor paymepts disturbances at an early stage or in connectiod with prc. ventiiv measures.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commercial Editor THE COMMITTEE of the Build- ing Societies' Association remained in session until late yesterday evening in preparation for the full Council meeting to-day. Td-days' meeting will deliver the move- ment's final answer to the Govern- ment request to postpone its rise in interest rates, and the protracted discussion yesterday reflects the sharply divided views of the societies. The smaller societies, many of whom have not the standing with the investment public enjoyed by the big names, are particularly determined to go ahead with the rate increase announced ,at the association's annual conference in April. The main reason then given was to restore margins in order to protect reserves, but these smaller societies are now equally anxious to gain some elbow-room so that rates to depositors may be raised if necessary, so that thqey can hold on to their funds. Some now report that. withdrawals have caubt up withb tnw deposits. The eow of the ICI 8 per cent. Issue must have given them . food for anxidus comment. Some veterans from the more substahtial societies also favour a rise, and the Government request has made them more determined. The generally co-operative attitude of the Council towards the Govern- ment has always had its strong critics within the movement ' I any case, the GOvernment speaks with a divided voice. The request to wait for the Prices and Incomes Board to report on interest charges dates from the old tolun- tary fitcomes policy. The Treasury now apparently wants a six-month pause to honour the freeze. But the Ministry ot Housing is m-uch more concerned with the supply of buildingloans. It would be ironic if a freeze of interest rates dried tp the movement's funds just as the Governmient's mortgage option plan was an- obunced. Last month the Council man* aged to postpone a decision, saying that it wanted to see how the aitua- tion developed. Nothing much has happened to help either side. The flow of funds has remained better thasi expected, but is clearly inadequate to meet demand:' the, movement could comply with the Government request without run ning into any real trotible-except from members of the public unable to find a mortgage. If aly'change is approved, it is likely to take the rather odd form of letting the increase stand. and then giving the extra money back to borrowers as a rebate-tbhis i simpler. than cancelling the notice. and scnding out new ones. At thi end of the meetins the outcome, was still completely. un- certain.",

   "text_content" : "IT WAS REVEALED yesterday that the attempted bid by Varian Associates, the American elec- tronics firm, for Edwards High Vacuum was rejected, not because the terms were unsatis- factory but because the senior executives at Edwards threatened to leave if the company passed into foreign control. This is an unusual case which raises two important issues. First, there are in Britain a large number of fairly small, science-based com- panies, sometimes privately owned, which offer idviting targets for American compani s wishing to exteiiind their intrestr,. to Europe. It is inaportret for the health of British indu#s4t as a whole that these \"-native\" sources of invention and techno- logical advance should be preserved. Centralised control Secondly, the Edwards affair highlights a problem which is beginning to concern a number of large American companies with European subsidiaries- how to reconcile the advantages of control from the centre with a reasonable degree of freedom for local managers. Recent resig- nations from Chemstrand appear to stem, at least in part, from a decision by the parent company in the U.S., Monsanto, to strengthen control over its Euro- pean fibre operations. The threat of American domi- nation in science-based indus- tries is usually thought of in relation to fields like computers and micro-electronics, where, for example, English Electric and Ferranti are trying to com- pete against IBM and Texas Instruments. The formation of larger British companies is often proposed as a way of counter- ing American competition, and in many cases this is the right approach. But it is important that the role of the small science-based firm should not be forgotten. Many creative individuals pre- ser to work for firms of this kind because they have the free- dom to pursue their particular lines of interest in a congenial atmosphere. They would strongly resent the idea that de- cisions about research. policy should be made at some distant headquarters, whether it hap- pens to be in London or in the United States. Some of these companies are in the forefront of their particular tehnology, well able to comnpete gaist Americans or any other regn rival. In these specialised elds vast size is not always essential -to success. It would be wrong to denigrate thecontributionswhickbAmerican science-based firms have made to the development of British ipdustry. The establishment. by Americans of manufacturing centres for computers and micro- circuits is certainly to be wel- comed. But it is preferable that they should do so by direct investment rather than by acqw- sitions. It is also desirable that they should conduct at least some original research in this country, bit -this cannot, always be relied upon. Flourishing British science-based firms, small and large, are an important national asset, which should not * i'ightly thrown away. Need for friedom The develkoment of big inter- national companies, sometimes but not always American-owned, is another trend which poses certain probiems so British industry. These companies need to attract talented young men in Britain and any other country in which they do business. But they will only do so if the young ment are given sufficient freedom to make thevwork interesting. There has been a tendeficy for British subsidiaries of American firms to be left very much to them- selves until they reach a stage. in size and orofitability, where the parent company feels the need fbr closer integration. This happened with British Ford and seems to- be happening with Chenstrand. The danger is that the local managers who helped to build up the company feel deprived,of authority to take real decisions. Perhaps the parent companies have not yet got across to their overseas employees that they are genuinely international in out- look, and that foreigners have just as good a chance of reach- ing the top posts as Americans. To achieve-this it may be neces- sary to ensure that the shares of the parent, companies are traded much more widely in the countries where they operate. It is also important that more foreigners should be promoted to the Board of directors, just as an American has recently been appointed to the Board of the Shell group of companies.

Mr, Cafagbaij is \"i to be up to hi npck betwpee now and Christmas in the Chab- cellor's traditional job of actln* as the taxpayers' watchdog .ap Government spending. When be comes to examine the prospect here, h may regret all the more that be has beep forced to re- main at No. 11. His first main problem is to prevent the Estimates for next yea fro lIooking too frighten- ing. Th1Prine Mlinister's crisis statement of July 20 included a well-publicised cut of Â£150m. in public investment in the next financial year. Since then there has been considerable scepticism, both inside and outside White- hall, on whether these reduo- tions-which are from an un- announced total-are genuine or not. SThe scepticism is probably unfair because by last July the normal annual survey of public expenditure would have been completed;' and the cost of the Government's programmes would --have been. known in general terms up to 1970-71 and 9i some detail for 1967-68, even though some important points, sach. as the date of the next sions increase, might remain tot later decision. The famous week-end axe-wielding by three Whitehall knights, while Mr. Wilson was in Moscow, was thus a genuine operation; but the Government may have the greatest difficulty in demonstrat- isg this to the sceptics.

To begin with, anyone who expects the Estimates for 1967- 68 presented next February to show a smaller increase than those for the present financial year may be in for a very rude awakening indeed. Some Â£95m. of the Prime Minister's cuts are in the 'nationalised industries, which are not in the Estimates (or even in the Treasury's wider computation of \" public expendi- ture \"). Of the remaining Â£55m., an unknown portion are in local government expenditure, and again will not appear in the Estimates. Apart from this, the Estimates for 1966-67 were themselves re- duced as a result of a previous round of crisis cuts imposed by the Chancellor in July, 1965. So the comparison will be from an unusually. low base. And even without these cuts 1966-67 would have been an unusually favour- able year for public expenditure, partly because it was an off-year for increases in pensions and other social benefits, which nor- mally take place almost every other year. There was a pensions increase in 1958, 1961, 1963 and 1965; and it is an open and con- troversial question whether there should be one in 1967 or not. The Estimates for this year, 1966-67, showed, on the bare figures, an increase of Â£594m., SOt iof i, 'VoltiAes r : ldli f no even t 1 iet ig bad not e t 'iy 1 be aggra- h Saccounting I robe i.

If a public relations i gimmick is desired,. the best one I would be for the Prime Minister to insist that -the publication of a preliminary revenue estimate be brought forward to appear on the same, day as the Vote on Account. Long term plans These short run problems pale, however, into insignificance com- pared with the fact Athat the Government has on its hands a long-term public expenditure programme based on a national growth rate which there is now no chance of achieving. Since early 1965 the official objective has been to limit the growth of public expenditure (including local authorities') to an average annual. increase of 4) per cent. in real terms.

Thb arithmetic of the prob- em is illustrated very tentatively i the table. The assumptions ave been designed to minimise ather than exaggerate it. Some 200m. has been taken off 1970 ublic expenditure because pen. ions an4 other benefits are tied, nder Ministerial pledges, to the eneral rise in the national :ealth, and will therefore be as than originally thought. The stimate for the increase i4 xed investment has been verW' cavily scaled down from the National Plan, and assumes that It will stay at the same percent. ae of GNP as in 1964; If this happens, and the investment rtio fails to rise, there -will be a dim prospect of faster growth ven in the 1970's. Well below forecast Yet even on these assump- ions the increase in public spending and fixed investment, ogether with the needed im- provement in the trade balance, will together take nearly all the ikely increase in resources. The amount left over for consump- ion out of income and private house-building would be lesp. han a third as much as origin- allv forecast under the Plan. While total national output would grow by just under 24 per cent. per annum, on average, personal consumption would rise by barely 1 per cent. This com- pares with about 3 per cent. during the previous decade. The tax implications are very uncertain. This year's tax in- creases, under the Selective Enm- ployment Tax and the Regulator, should take care of the immedi- ate problems. The timing of any subsequent increase will obviously depend on the generil state of the economy; and during the next recession the problem may temporarily go under ground. In additiono,, a great deal depends on the trend of savings. Roughly speaking, how- ever, an average annual growth of real disposable incomes of ov~e 2 per cent. will have to be reduced by around I per cent., or over Â£200m. in. an average year through higher taxes i public expenditure is not cut.

   "text_content" : "\"ir-In riply to Mr. S, R. Carter (Sept. 6), most building societies exercised a voluntary Standsti for many months and kept tbhe mortgage rate at 6% per cent. notwithstanding a rise, from Jlly 1, 1965, in the rate paid to nvestors. This left an insufficient margin to cover management costs, to meet an ever-increasing tax bill and to maintain proper reserves so hat eventually. an increase in the mortgage rate to 7% per cent. be- came imperative. Whether, in the present financial crisis, a 4 per cent, tax-paid rate for investors will prove sufficient to retain existing investments and attract new funds remains to be seen. TwoAincreases were neces- sary'during similar conditions in N, E. . Gioos, The Building Societies Association. 14, Park Street, W.I. .. Tax Free Sir,-The suggestion made by Mr. 0. M.

Â£7 2 6 if the 4 per cent. interest payable to shareholders was free of income tax (as distinct from being income- tax paid, as at present), the Â£1 16s 4d could be passed on to borrowers reducing the rate which they pay to Â£5 6s 2d--say, 5Y per cent. But this rate of interest (which would not be allowable against tax) would only be of advantage to individual borrowers if it were les than the effective rate of interest they at present pay. After allowing for income tax relief and earned income allow- ance, the effective cost of a mort- gage rate of 7% per cent. is at present as follows:- Effective cost MIargial of mortgage ritetof rattof - income-tax 7 pe cento. s d Â£ a d 8 3 4 16 9 60 5 9 3 4 0 6 04 Nil 7 2 6 It will be seen that those borrowers whose marginal rate of income-tax is 6s or less would benefit from Mr. Simon's suggestion: borrowers whose mar ginal rate of income-tax is 8s 3d would be -worse off. Surtax-pay ing investors would be better oil while surtax-paying borrowers would suffer, Whether there would be an advantage or di- advantage to investors and borrowers as a whole, and what -ould be the cost to the Exchequer, could only be ascer- tained from a knowledge of th tax brackets into which bullding society investors and borrowera fall, L.

The ew figure. was announced yester following tplks between Mr4 Pted Mulley, Minister of Aviof n and M' Pisapl, French Minister of Equipment. It reprqsents an Investment by each coundry of Â£250m. spread over II years from the start of the iardf inA 101 1 '. It c prises an estimate of Â£170i. for all work up to initial ertlfication U' the Concord in '-- another 80m. for further d %epet beyond that date until 1973, making Â£450m., and a \"con- gency allowance of another I5sm. to bring the total to Â£500m., in terms of M196 prices. The oritgial estimate for Con- cord,. when the project, began in 1962, was 1f5(0m.--l170m., or 7Â£15m*-fÂ£m. e4ch for Britain and France. By 1964, this had risen to Â£275m., or about Â£137m. each, and by early this ypgr the estimate was being quoted at' o370m., or Â£Sm. each. The increae to the Iltest figure is due to chnluge in the design; to wages increases and o under- estimation in the earlier-stimates. It also includes provisfoR for fur- ther development of the project, not accounted for hitherto. \"Uneconomic\" Commenting on the increased figure, the Committee of Public Accounts, in its second report, issued yesterday, revealed that the Treasury had said that the Concord was unlikely to be economic in the sense that the Governments would recover all their expenditure on development by a levy on sales. SIs was considered that on an admittedly optimistic forecast of the number of Concord aircraft likely to be sold, the levy which production aircraft could bear would, on the baiis of present esti- mates, recOver no more than approximately one-third of the research and development costs.\" The Public Accounts Committee expressed concern at the \" mas- sive \" rse in the project's estimated cost, and srpessed that the expec- tation of limited recovery of the fuids spent emphasised the need for effective control over the pro- ject., Editolal comnmeat Page 14; criticised E d to a o mm e nt P ag e 1 criticised It Wugs that contracts have been i placed with alrbsmaand en i-e compsiaes on- a cotplus and. a price-to-be-agred *basis respec- tivly, but Committee wants Sc see incentive arrangements intreo duced without delay where possible. The Committee also considers that a continuing tight watch should be kept on the project, and that the likely extension of the number of international collabora- tive projects requires that a thorough study of the efficiency and economy of the sharing arrangements should be made as soon as possible.\" Industry's Attitude The industry's attitude on Con- Crd is that this new Â£500Ss. estimate should be set against the fact that 13 airlines throughout the world have already taken \"options \" for 60 Concords, with at least another seven aircraft in advanced negotiation and likely to be formally announced soon. Further orders are also being canvassed, and it is expected,that by the time. the first prototype flies from Toulouse in February, .1968, between 75 and 100 aircraft will have been sold. The manufac. tprers are looking to a total of at least 200 aircraft sold by the mid- 1970s.1 At the1- present quoted price of $16m. (nearly Â£6m.), the present order book will be worth around Â£360m. if all the \"*options.\" an' nounced to date become firm con tracts, while by the mid-1970s the order book could be worth well over Â£1,000m. It is certain that the higher development cost now revealed will be reflected in a higher unit cost per airdraft. There is no indi- cation yet of what this might be, but it is thought the price might go to t20m. (over Â£7m.). li:gh cost of aircraft projects Prge 12",

This means that the companies will try to get as near as possible to the 5d a-therm received. by.BP, while the ias Council will expect to pay pot more than 3%d a therm for th. initial deliveries from the smaller structuresand substantially less for the larger quantities. The oil companies for their part are stressing the risks involved in the search, and the danger that the ratio of dry wells may increase as it- continues. Quite apart from their natural desire to show a large profit on their North Sea ventures, they feel that if gas is priced too low it-will become competitive with fuel oil in the industrial markets. They are therefore arguing that before,any North Sea gas is sold to industrial consumers not at pre- sent using gas, the requirements of the. peisin gas market must be satisfied. The Gas Council for its part regards the North Sea dis- .coteries as An opportunity for altractlij new customers, and wiits the Government to give it permission to make specia sales to industrial users as soon as possible.",

But this S by Io means the sum total of their additional costs resulting from the, new tax. The problem is that those who serve the catehia6 industry are also. service industries. Grocery wholesalers, wine mer. chants, butchers. laundries, and contract cleaners are affected, and some have already announced price increases to their restaurant customers averaging 1 to 2 per cent, as well as fewer deliveries.

The company has the additional problem of having to give Day increases to keep the staf ftt needs, and at the same time to economise on iabour, which it is doing by dismissing its part- time workers and' employing women rather than men on its Golden Egg operatiop. The same situation of waiting and wondering how the monthly bills from their suppliers will be affected faces the top restaura- teurs. as it does Mr. Kaye.

The staff of 80 means that labour costs for the house will be up by Â£5,200 in a-full year. Mr. L. MUller, chairman of De Vere Hotels. has calculated that the new tax will add Â£10,000 to the overheads of the Mirabelle. equivalent to about 3s for every client. For the group as a whole, the additional cost will be Â£100,000. But Mr. MOller said yesterday-rather bravely, I tllought-that the company was not contemplating raising its prices. \"We want to increase our turnover and. im- prove outr eficiency through better buyig, better supervision, and economt sig od staff. We want to support the Chancel- lor.\" The proof of the pudding Is in the eating, however, and already the De'Vere group ha- extra Id on all items up to Is 6d. 2d up to 5s, and 3d up to 15s.

A spokesman said that it was only hoped to recover the Â£350,000 SET charge arising within the catering division itself by these thanges.

The remaining half looks like hold- ing up \"will, so profits before tax could emerge at Â£1.3m. against Â£1.09m, for the full year. This would raise cover from 1.2 to 1.4 times for a maintained 25 per cent. dividend, and inspire hopes of a higher total when conditionS allow --mainly because continued spend- ing on capital account should not seriously encroach on dividend considerations: net liquidity in the last accounts was still over Â£1.2m. With the yield at 6.2 per cent. and selling at possibly 11.3 times earnings. the shares at 20s 3d look fair enough, although obviously the outlook is not one of tin- qualified optimism, But at least Allied's big customers in the elec- trical generating and transmission field should stay busy for a while.

Sales are more or legs on target with a 14 per cent. rise to Â£1.73m. and margins have obviously beed kept under control. Profits are 15 per cent. better at Â£192,000 before tax and there are earnings of 65.7 per cent, for the dividend which is \"restricted \" to 29 per cent., against 30 per cent. forecast and the 27. per cent. total paid for 1964-65. All of the dividend increase came at the interim stage; -byt, oddly enough, another company announcement seems to rule out any increase of this kind. Philip Kunick which had miuch the same idea, has rqecinded its own rise by Treasury request For the time being, then. it might be best to do the same with Haggas. putting the shares on a 5% per cent. yield at 10s. This looks thin for the worsted industry, but Haggas. specialising in all-white yam with a quick stock-turnover and keen prices, has the record -to match.

But of the overseas companies-contributing 30 per cent. of profits-India has come back, partly due to the currency devaluation. Thus profits before tax-without any material change in investment income-are Â£2.3m. against Â£2.7m.. and overall prospects do not eti- courage hopes of much more than Â£4.8m, against Â£5.lm. for the full year.

This was reveaitd by dowaraf chairman, Sir -Charles Hughes Hallett, in a statement yesterday splaining Why the negotiations broke down after only a week. Varian mades it clear. e said, that It would not make an offer unless it bad the prior support of the Edwards Board. As the directors were advised hat the proposed terms were fair and easonable they agreed to back air ofier-subject to an assurance. that he level of research and production facilities in the U.K. would be at east maibtathed. ' Varian indljated that this assurance would be givon.

These problems, he says, were greater than had been expected and there was a fall in production with its consequent increase in costs and effect on profit margins. The produc- tion difficulties have now been over- come. \"The strong liquid position of your company should enable us to meet any of the problems brought about by the present economic posi- tion of the country,\" the chairman adds. SANITAS TRUST At an annual meeting in London yesterday a motion was approved that the name of The Sanitas \" Trust be chbqnged to The Sanitas Trust, thus dropping the inverted commas.",

I Sales tor the first four months of the current year, with the excep- tion of one unit, have improved, but Mr. Falk emphasises that the parent is closely connected with the ouilding industry, and any recession can have an appreciable effect onr its earnings. The group manufactures domestic and industrial equipment and appliances for electricity, gas and oil. As indicated in February. gronli profits in the year ended March 31, 1966. were somewhat lower than last Yearls record, in spite of sales (both home and export) being higher than ever before. As reported on Septem. ber 1, profit, before tax, was 682,353 (Â£746,852) and the dividend 141 per cent., as before. Increased Costs Operating costs of the national distribution and selling organisation rose to a greater extent than the extra gross profit earned. \"The insidious cost Increases, which include the direct results of Govern ment measures, is a problem which Is being continuously studied, and further reorganisation to reduce those has been effected in the administra- tive side of our business.\" the chair man reports. On the overseas trading companie. he says that the South African comi pany made a \" very fne profit,\" wbhle in Australia picture was - verv similar to last year-competition is getting more Intense, and margins tend to shrink.

The total value of orders receivtd (Â£122.1 million) wa Â£3.2 million higher than in the first half of 1965. Sales invoiced (Â£130.3 million) were Â£9.5 million higher. The profit for the brst half year was affected -by Vtrious factors, ionluding the additional costs incurred empooiarily by reason of the major epansion of telecommunications production and the rationalisation of the production of cables. The Govern. ment measures are increasingly affecting business conditions which are expected to become progressively more difficult during d next few months. The efforts to improve internal efficiency and pto- ductivity have been strengthened, but in view of the general economic background, the profit for the year 1966 is unlikely to be higher than the 1965 profit. At the end of June the domestic appliance business was merged with that of Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd., in Brtiish Domestic Appliances Ltd., which becomes the second largest manufacturer of domestic appliances in the U.K. An interim dividend on the ordinary stock of the company of 8%, less income tax at 8s. 3d. in the Â£, was paid on nd April 1966. This dividend was paid in the tax year ending on 5th April 1966 to take advantage of the transitional provisions of the Finance Act 1965. It is not proposed to make any further interim distribution. The company is not a \"close company\" for the purp6se of the Finance Act 1965.

Period of Direct l Rule Sir Albert also endorsed the two conditions already laid down by Zambia: that a period of direct rule by Britain sh6uld precede Rhodeslan Indipendence: aild that there should be no independence until there is a majority Govern- ment elected on the one man one vote principle. It is believed that Sir Albert put his two pro Isals in the form of a document 0v brcti W circulated to the Prtime Minw!terAa A well as his two proposals. he maintained that the crus of the problem was that o. categorical assurance had been given by Mr Wilson that there would be no lefal Independence without maOrity le. In his view, this was even more important than the speed at which the Salisbury regime should be over- thrown. Sir Albert echoed Mr. Leb -ua1 Yew, the Singapore Prime inister, when he said that although ie was on the best of terms with Mr. Wlson he had lost faith in the SBritia Government's handling of the Rhoddslan problem. Continulng his attack, he referred to Mr. Wilson's having turned a deaf ear tp pleas by other Comtmonwealth members for the 1961 constitution to be tuspendd; to British oppos tion 0to the pleas or African menm- bers at the United Nations; and to the fat that the only pnishment for tresonf should have been voluntary sadctions. Mr. Wilson's Interventionis The Vionu ea t Si fSrs Albert's on- laught wt such that Mr. Wilson as twisf, dyreia to' intervine This -M contrrayt9 the siil practice at Mthes\"t 'aorsally a Pri*e Minister, bacs be bus netun to speak, is allowed his. head. without intSr. ruptions. But It is understood that accusd .-Mr. Wilson of bavi content of the nS it mith froma the 1rmMjsnth 1965 Cos- optci ipublished to shoe at re ad been o attempte tonisieapU . ' On another occasion Sir Albert's arguaent became a little hard to follow when be appeared to be lay. ing-the blame fr the present altua tion on Mr. Wilson because of the actions of tbis and previous British overnments stretchin back to thi time of the 1923 oaNstitulon so Rbodesia. Mr. Wilson t oblied to mention that he wall seven years old at the *ise. Sir Albert countered by saying that in that case Mr. Wilson's father or grandfather were to blame. Not so, replied Mr. Wilson. since he and his father had been in Australia in 1923. Apparently <,ir- Albert imm retorted tht .lt was no dob Australia tht.'Mt. Wilson had learned his anti-African sentiments . This greatly increased the bitterness of the atmosphere in the conference room. remar nrtanAlt' Ie hinted that be was cot prepared to leave the Commonwealth on the Rhodesian issue. Appealing to Mr. Wilson to do something to show that the other Prime Ministers were wanted here, he suggested that it he didn't, the Commonwealth might continue in body but not in spirit- that only lip service might be paid to Commonwealth principfes. Reluctance from India Two of Sir Albert's points-not leaving the Commonwealth and advocating the use of forcI-we mentionedearlir in the first spech of the day . Sg oreign Minister of Ingdia. Mr. Haksar, Indian deputy High Cotdinissioner, aftbrwards gave a resume of the AIdn seeh \"Clearly, none of us can go back from this conference with nothing more to report than thai we are hblp less. We are not satisfied with thib he said. He went on: \"it is no. a good thing to let Mr. Smitbhave a feeling of assurance that fordi will st be used-that the ultirpate sanction will not be imposed.\" But apart from thik. and the fact; that India would prefer to see a col tective Commonwealth solution evolve from the ptbsent discussions,. the Indian statement does not appear to have ofered any coistructive des. Indeed, Mr Hiksar affirmed that nldia was reluctant to do this. Mr. Joseph Manslbl, Vice-Preta. dent of Kenya, supported Zambia In demanding the clar-cut declaration by the British Government that malority rule by the Africans must be achievedhbefore Rhodesia was granted independence. . He salq that Mr. Wilson bad agreed that the present voluntary sanctions' had faled. The matter should there.

H~We aIlt Mr. Wltson to say cation f the present economi uanc. tiona. Mr. RHatld Holt Prime Minister of Australia, yesterday told the Royal Commonwealth Society, that the Con- ference should apply the rule of what was \"fair and practical\" when it came to Judgin solutinsa proposed for Rhodesia. Force, be said, was impracticable. A new problem is being raised by the length -of time Prime Ministers are taking for their speeches. The two days originally allowed for the.. discussion, qs Rhodesia have now been shown to be totally inadequate. The debate will continue to-day, wittIb'rW ai ins nine Prime Ministers jbr :.pro sentetives anxioua torpeak. Amons these are UU. Odat oa4jiand and Dr. inda of Malawilboe of whom have. strong views on' bhodsia. though not In exactl the same electiona-and Mr. LjWWr rans of Canada, who is not known for brevity. To pin time. the Coerence hba decided to,%Othk laniptl only w it tatt a irtay. but an hour has also been knocked off the lunch break. Despite this it is expected that the 9 speeches to come will take most. if not all. of the day. Time Problem Now Acute It iaywell he. th elrwth. thttMr. Wilson will not be 4blI to give his detailed reply until Monday. And even that can be seen as only the end of the beginning. For after all the set speechds and Mr. Wilson's reply, there will be a period of across. the-table discussion designed not so much as an exposition of individual views. but as a constructive exer- cise. Since the delegations are known to be anxious not to foreto the rt of the aMpda. it is clear that tho',tinme prooltWW l becoming acute.

   "text_content" : "hv DARE WIGAN HAVING saddled Sodium to win the St. Leger, 0. Todd will be hoping to augment .'that success by taking the Park Hill Stakes (2.40) at Doncaster to-day with Mrs. W. H. D. RIleySmith's Parthlan Glance, and the probability is that) these hopes will be realised. Parthian Glance, a filly by Parthia, out of the good, sta yig mare, Tenacity, has only run taree times: first, when runner-up to. Varina, for the Carreras Piccadilly Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield in May; next, when in receipt of 8 lbs, she defeated Mr. Marcus Wickham- Boynton's filly by three lengths in the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot; and finally, when winnmng the Yorkshire Oaks by a length from Predicament. Excuses were made for Predica- ment at York, and there is no doubt but that her jockey experienced some difficulty in positioning her in order to deliver a 'challenge. Nevertheless, one had an impres. sion that Piggott had something in hand on the winner and I expect Parthian Glance to confirm the form, and also again to get the better of Varinla. She is a reason. ably confident selection. The finish of the Doncaster Cup (3.50) ray be fought out by Desert Call II. a French-bred five. year-old horse who chased home Charlotown 'in the Oxfordshire Stakes at Newbury last month, and Alkalde, who was responsible for a ne weightcarrying perforane when finishing third to Salvo and Allenheads for the Vaux Gold Tankard at Redcar when con- ceding these two good-olats three-year-olds 34 lbs and 27 lbs respectively, having previously won a vaiuanie sponor a ne ya lengths over 2% miles it hnot to sp u and, wit 4 Cook-nmtlis'ssddle is ikely to give backers a run for their money in the Milton Sell- ing Handicap (2.0). And Chrona, though she seems to have-two ways of running, would, on her best form, have ani outstanding chance in the equivalent handicap (3.20). An outsize crystal ball would be a useful asset when tackling the problem of the Bradgate Park Nur- sery Handicap (4.20), but two who could go close here are Aiguilletite, who does not seem harshly treated with 8 st 9 lbs judged on her run- ning behind Pla and St. Pault Girl in the Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket n July, and Skleki a filly by Dari.w, who with E. John- son claiming the 5 lbs allowance, has only 6 at 9. lbs to carry. Nantagos is an Irish fancy for the Feversham Stakes (4.50) for two-year-olds, run over one mile, but I doubt his beating Nip Away a colt by Narrator who ran well behind Rlbocco and Hored Moon at Newbury last month and who was staying on well there over six furlongs. At Newbury this afternoon, High San, jpudedon form shown in last year's Diadem Stakes at Ascot, may be just too good for Wep's Boy at a -difference of 7 lbs in the Whatcombe Stakes (4.30)f",

   "text_content" : "By Our Mining Editor The o nglo Amican Corpraw don group's final dividends for its Orange Free State gold-mining companies were issued well after market hours last night. They are not likely to cause much stir in the share market this morning. The exception is President Brad which, with a final of 4s 3d, has raised its total for the year to September 30 by 3d to 7s 6R. This will come as a pleasant surprise because, according to official fore- casts, it had not been expected that the Saaiplaas acquisition would start augmenting distributions until next year. The other dividends are all .un- changed. The Westera Holdings final is down by Is 6d compared with a year ago but the interim was raised by like amount in order to decrease the discrepancy between the two payments. So the total is the same at 16s. There may be a little disappointment here because a modest increase was officially foreshadowed I P .l as declared an unchained dividend, for the year. It is Â£1227 a share on the 1,000 shares held Iointly by' Western Holdings and FS. Geduld which is equal to last September's Is 6d a share on the capital as it then was. The payments for the past two years are tabulated below. November 7is the pay date. Sept Mar., Sept., Mar., 1966 1966 1965 196S P.S. Geduld 7/ 5/ 7/ 5/ Pre. Bnnd . 4/3 3/3 4 3/3 P Se.

AYER HITAM UNIT WORKING AGAIN In the batch of monthly tin-mining returns issued last night that for Ayr Hitna shows a further falling off but there should be better things in store because the company's No. -2 dredge started up again on September 2 having been shut down on August 1 for repairs to digging machinery, a shut-down that was then expected to last until mid-September. Tronoh's 125* tons of concentrates for August makes an eight-month total of 1.010 tdns against only 681* tons atthis time a year ago.

   "text_content" : "With this excellent performance the Stuttgart company retrieve t*e reputation which their Magic Flute and Lohengrin had somewhat diminished. Wieland Wagner's pro- duction of Lulu, like his produc- tion of Wozzeck at Frankfurt (also with Anja Silja as heroine) affords an intense, exciting theatrical ex- perience. The characters of the drama are sharply realised; the character of the work as a whole is vividly projected. Like Rennert in his Hamburg/ Cologne version, Wagner sets the whole play within the circus ring conjured up by the rologue; but whereas Rennert's dener gave us a distracting backcloth of painted spectators, Wagner has a semi-circle of bars caging his \"beasts.\" In neither case is the device necessary, or even particu- larly helpful-a ramming home of the obvious, rather. But the result here is unobtrusive, and the domestic interiors set up within the ring, each given its dominant colour, are highly effective. More- over, the fairly elaborate scene- changes are swiftly effected, prov- ing once again (see also Miss Askonas's letter on Page 14) that when the Edinburgh productions are inadequate, the limitations of the King's Theatre must not always take all the blame. I first heard Anja Silja in 1959 (she was 17, I think) as a brilliant young spitfire Queen of Night. Since then she has undertaken a Lilli Lehmann-like repertory reach- ing from Constanze and Leonore, through Senta, Isolde, Brinnhilde, to Salome, Marie and Lulu. But unlike Lehmann's, her repertory is not founded on a complete mastery of vocal technique, of firm, pure tone at any pitch, dynamic and speed. Miss Silja's tone can flash like a sword, fly like an arrow, and even be curiously tender. But there are times when she screams rather than sings. Vitality, vigour, strength of personality and sheer vocal stamina carry her through- these, and that indefinable thing called \"star quality.\" There is ex- citement in her very physical presence, in her long, young, bapely iumbsl, hir , let us admit it--dirA *an-pt sexasppeal: al bt which sounds in her voice as wpl. There is nothing artiftial about her, in persoality, or. In style. Sbe is fresh, bracing. 'In , claical -pera she cuts though centuries of tradition (and some people hate the result). ,As the. am al Lulu- death of three husbands in the irst three \"teaef-sli ivJ a rivet- ns peformance: cijd, con- lenceles, confident. 8he can till path hr voice tip to the high notes of thip etraordi.ry. role which Berg wrote as if for an ivoiln, a Zerbinetta, with dramatic power. t 'rowni.. Crudity, almt comic-strip directness of action is one of the elements in the twin plays which Berg joined to make Lulu. French farce is another in the scene with admirers concealed in every corner. To Wedekind's. mixture Berg added pathos, sentimentality even. Wagner's production toned down nothing, yet composed all the ele- ments, sharp, satirical, sweet, into a brilliant theatrical sequence. The intricate personal relationships were precisely conceived, and exactly stated. In the large cast not one character was weakly portrayed. Wedekind declared that the Countess Oeschwitz, not Lulu, w\"as eventually* his tragic heroine, at one end of the spectrum which reaches from love at its most selfish to its most self-sacrificing. Sona Cervena's impersonation was dignified, nobly pathetic. Berg died before scoring more two sections of the third act (and permission for another hand to complete the work is still with- held by the composer's widow). This creates a problem. Wagner's solution differs from Rennert's. in that he uses more of Wedekind's dialogue (spoken over the Adagio), but less of his action. The orches tral playing, under Ferdinand Leitner. had colour and character; But surely it was mistaken to superimpose a realistic electric bell over th eringing (vibraphone and triangle) which Berg had already written into his score.",

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON In his performance last night of A Mass of Life. Sir Malcolm Sargent demonstrated once again what an excellent conductor of Delius he is. He hasn't all Beecham's fire. proprietary zeal and exquisite finish, but he loves the music, understands it, presents it clearly and keeps it moving. In the Mass this last point is all- important. Even Beecham could hardly have been more successful in avoiding the heaviness that dogs the six-eight \"dancing\" choruses. To do this with such a large body of singers (BBC Chorus and Choral Society, Adexandra Choir, Harrow and Royal Choral Societies) was a considerable feat. On the whole it was a restrained performance. The reasons for this were clear. The hall was hot and in the first half, especially in the tremendous eight-part Invocation to the Will with which the work opens, the sopranos flattened and wilted on their high notes. Intona- tion improved in the second half and the soft singing was admirable throughout. Then John Cameron sang the big baritone part with uncomfortably edgy tone and seemed to have little in reserve. It is true that he also sang with great feeling and shaped the cruelly long and sometimes unvocal phrases effectively, but the lack of power meant lack of vigour in the orchestral accompaniment. Finally, Nietzsche's text was sung in English. The old Bernhoff trans- lation has been tactfully gone over, but it is still dreadful fustian and the paucity of strong consonants quite alters the effect of the music. Since so little comes through or can he understood if it does, why not sing it In German? What. ever the philosophical value of Nietzsche's purple prose, It sounds splendid in the original, The pause was made not in the usual place but after the first chorus of the second part, This divides the work more evenly and ensures that the quiet orchestral movement with the echoing horn calls is not drowned by the audience settling down. It was some time before the horns of the BBC Symphony' Orchestra settled down last night; when they did, the effect was magical. The move- ment owes much to Grieg, but to reproduce Grieg's originality so faithfully is in itself remarkable. There was fine playing elsewhere, not only in the remaining major pieces but in the florid accompani- ment to the third section of part one-\" In thine eyes I gazed of late.\" The subsidiary solos were excellently done by Heather Harper, Yvonne Minton and Ronald Dowd.",

   "text_content" : "by PENEOPE 'IQU$Â·9Â· SSaturday night in Texas. n, the basement of the jail Oir twn's .leading citizen is busy pistol-whipping a Nego. On the' ground floor the sheriff is beini systematically beaten up by the vicepresident of he bank. Down the street the teenagers are madly cavorting, while at a rival party their elders, maudlinly drunk, fire pistols off into the Texan night. And at a suitably sym- bolic location, the scrap heap of wrecked cars just outside town, the local bad boy, newly escaped from the State prison, is waiting for someone to bring him a car that will go. It takes The Chase. (Odon,-- Leicester Square) quite a while to tie itself into so extravagant a knot. And by the time it does so, even the most susceptible may have decided that, however rotten things may' be in the State of Texas, they can hardly be as bad as all that. But The Chase is a film with two tecognisable lines of ancestry,: the Peyton Place tradition, with its almost gloating discovery of what is supposed really to go on in small towns, and the social moralis- ing tradition, reaching right back to classics such as Fury. No one in The Chase actually gets lynched: instead the 'convict .is shot down by a bystander on the steps of the jail, in a scene which looks like a much more than casual gesture.in the direction of Dallas. Lillian Hellman's splenetic script gives startlingly little quarter. The convict (Robert Redford). is not as black 'as the town has painted him; the sheriff (Marion Brando, mumbling as tenaciously and ending up as blood-spattered as he did years ago .in On The Waterfront) stands for old- fashioned rectitude. Otherwise, everyone is violent, drunk, power-, crazed, malevolent-or weak, vic- timised and determined to get his own back. Beatings up are watched, in shadowy and heavily stressed close-up, by crowds of anonymous citizens, who can mus- ter only gloomy and apathetic stares which suggest that, in this town at least, everyone has long since lost any capacity for shock. As a piece of social criticism, the film is as overstated as a revivalist tract, with far too many charac- ters who seem to have been intro- duced for no other purpose than to be seen behaving badly. A wizened old gossip totters about the town looking for something new- to disapprove of; a quartet Sos repellent teenagers scamper from one crisis-point to the next. At the end, when the luckless con- vict is trapped in the car dump, and the whole town drives out to hurl home-made incendiaries into the wreckage, the violence on the screen and the misanthropy behiid Sthe camera unite in an impression t of highly resistible hysteria. F All the same, there are moments, Sparticularly in the early scenes. r when Arthur Penn's direction im- I poses itself with a rough and florid authority. When the 'characters Sheriff Maron Brnado (ritha t stop striking the attitudes set up for them in the story, there's a jagged, dangerous feeling of people looking for any escape from bore- dom. And the cold eye'turned by the camera on their antics is echoed in Brando's peiformance, so with- drawn as to suggest .that be has never met anyone in the town be- fore; and hopes, with some reason, never to set. eyes on any of them again., The advertising for Kaleido- scope (Warner Cinema) seems determined to sell it as a \"switched-on thriller,\" a \" groovie movie\" and so on. A slightly daunting prospect for anyone who, may be feeling that our celebrated swinging cinema has perhaps already swung once too often. Gratefully, then, one can report that Kaleidoscope is not really all that switched on, less so in fact than some even if its main setting is a gambling club and its heroine (Susannah York) is the. breathless owner of a Hampstead boutique. In. an old-fashioned, Rafflesian way, the amateur gambler crook (Warren Beatty) hits on the appeal- ing idea of marking his cards at source, by breaking into a playing- card factory and tampering with the -printing 'plates. A peacefully foolproof career at chemin de for is interrupted when Scotland Yard summons.him (as Bond was sum. moned baqk in Casino Royale) to smash London's-narcotics king by beating him at cards, 'or some reason, card games t in films have to be bungled very I badly indeed if they are to be less e than.bypnotic; and Jack Smight, r the director who only a few tl nibnths ago was showing his : lovalty to Chandlertown thrillers in The Moving Taget, keeps this a one amusingly keyed up. For the 1 rest, there are the usual snatches t io photographic gamesmanship, c with the camera kept cowering t behind the furniture so that it can advance on the action from the least likely direction. And, naturally, .the Napoleonic villain (Eric Porter) keeps Alsatians, a butler, a flamethrower,...and a country house about the size of Knole. for staging the finale of shotguns at-dawn ; while our play- ful British policeman (Clive Revill) counters busily with a passion for tov engines. Perversely, the sad :hing about switched-on thrillers is how old-world they look. Having chosen an impossible plot, Kaleidoscope at least treats it with a becoming lack of conviction. Assault on a Queen (Plaza; directed by Jack Donohue) tells an even taller story' as though it hoped, without any degree of confidence, that it, might be taken half- seriously, International gang (Frank Sinatra in a yachting cap; Als Kjellin as a former U-boat skipper with a neurotic glint in his eye; Virna Lisi, stirringly described as \" a blond Italian Robin Hood\") dredge up a sunken German sub, marine, and repower it with car battceies with a view, to holdiig up the Queen Mary on the high seas. Rod Serling's talkative script, with everyone engaging in sorrowful reminiscence, leaves little time for the adventure, which in the end gets bundled through as though everyone had lost heart. Fatally, as the U-boat goes under for the last time, it begins to remind one of those plastic submarines, powered on baking powder, that they used to give away with the cornflakes. Jmrn Donner's To Love (Jacey, Charing Cross Road) opens with a funeral and ends with the widow, first seen standing stiffly by as eulogies are pronounced over her dead husband, backing hesitantly into a second marriage with an exuberant travel agent. The affair releases her and pins him down; and Donner stalks his couple (Harriet Anderson and Zbigniew Cybulski) like a private detective looking for evidence for love in- stead of divorce. An odd film. sympathetic because of Donner's evident determination to try to tell the truth; irritating because of a worried Scandinavian intellec- tualism which can't let well alone. Cut-in shots--television talks, an ice-hockey match-break meaning- fully in as fragments from the out. side world: even the jokes are not to be taken too lightly. Not a successful film; but in its nagging, persistent ..way, by no means negligible either. OCXuK1D1C C1U1cI.",

So far there can be no variation, but North's rebid poses a slight problem. Some players, anxious to show a balanced minimum, would favour 1 NT, but North said 2 diamonds, which is, I think, the bid to be preferred. Now South has a problem. With 12 points and a good heart suit he must bid strongly, but what is the best way of reaching the right con- tract? After some thought South bid 2 spades, which again meets with my approval. North, who had to decide between giving heart pre- ference and bidding 2 NT, even- tually chose the no-trump rebid. So far the bidding had been good, and South should have raised his partner to 3 NT. a contract which is unbeatable. South, however, bid 3 hearts, which North had to raise to 4 hearts. South bid as he did be- cause he was a first-class player of the cards, and his partner was no. This breaks the maxim that it is generally better for the infOior player to play a good contract, than for the good player to play an inferior one. Against 4 hearts West led the Queen of clubs, and declarer was in on the table. The average player takes a trump finess at trick 2, losing to West's Queen. The spade switch is obvious, and with the diamond finesse wrong the declarer goes down, protesting against the injustice of fortune. But South, though he had steered the partnership into the wrong con- tract, showed superb skill in the play of the hand. He played Ace and King of hearts, trying to drop the Queen- his first hope did not materialise. The Knave of diamonds lost to East's King-the second chance did not come off. East, of course, re- turned the spade King. South let this win, but he took the Queen, and played on diamonds in the hope, that with a 3-3 break he would be able to discard two spades before an opponent ruffed. ? Unfortunately West ruffed after one spade discard-failure once again. However, as West had no more spades to lead South made his contract. His fourth effort, the most subtle of them all, ducking one round of spades, in case the player short of diamonds was also short of spades, had saved the situation.' South's play of the hand shows perfect planning-he 'made his contract because he left no stone unturned.",

Announc- ing the grant-from W. D. and H. 0. Wills-in London yesterday Mr. Eric Bravington, managing director of the LPO, said: \"To us this is a very considerable grant and there are absolutely no strings attached to it.\" One of the effects of the grant will be that about two thirds of the orchestra's regional concerts will be given with the same players, soloists and conductors who have appeared in London. \"Although we have slightly reduced the number of regional concerts we are very anxious to present them where possible as exact replicas of the Festival Hall concerts,\" said Mr. Bravington. Another improvement which the grant will make possible will be the increase of the number of strings at Mahler and Bruckner concerts in the Festival Hall from 60 to 70. \"This should help to overcome the rather dry acoustics of the hall,\" Mr. Bravington ex- plained. Other plans include the improve- ment of rehearsal facilities for particularly difficult programmes, . the invitation of even more lead- ing artists to work with the orchestra for continuous periods rather than individual concerts and the development of the industrial concerts, which are given each season at the Albert Hall. These have proved such a success that each programme has to be repeated to accommodate the demand. The orchestra will also take a close look at its policy towards the commission of new works. Son et Lumiere Run Extended ' The Lord Chamberlain has given permission for the run of Son et Lumiere at Hampton Court Palace to be extended. The last per- formance will now take place on Saturday, October 15, instead of on Saturday, September 24, as previously announced. Son et Lumiere is sponsored by the London Tourist Board and is in aid of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and supports the research projects of the Muscular Dystrophy Group of Great Britain. The performances take place nightly at 9 p.m., Sundays excepted.",
