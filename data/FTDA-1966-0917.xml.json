   "text_content" : "By ur Lbour Reporter British Motor Corporatios announced aut might that 30,600 out of Its 112,00 labour force would be on short time next week. It i th t ho l will repreent about a 15 per cent. cut in production. Biggest blow to the workers was that some were to be put on a two-day week, although the majority on short time will work at least three days. The short time working will last until November 4, when several thousand will be dismissed as redundant BMC was still not sure just how many it would have to dismiss and much will depend upon.whether next month's Motor Show brings in a healthy crop of orders. Current redundancy estimates vary between 5.000 and 8,000. Short-time working will affect 18,500 in the Corporation's Birmingham area factories, 6,500 in Oxford, and 5,600 in Coventry, Scotland, South Wales and London. I I 4 t r r r 1 I i, Last night's announcement brought the first management admission that some men would only work a twoday week, although shop stewards had earlier expressed fears that this was possible. Such men can expect to be paid between Â£8 and Â£11 a week by BMC. The majority of those/on short time, however, will be work- ing three days, and some four days a week. When Mr. Tom Stewart, assis- tant secretary of the unofficial BMC joint shop stewards' commit- tee, heard of the two-day working he summoned a meeting of shop steward representatives from 18 BMC factories. They will meet at Coventry on Monday, Walk-out at SU Carburetter BMC's redundancy programdite occurred yesterday, when 900 at SU Carburetter, of Birmingham, a subsidiary supplying other manu- facturers besides BMC, walked out. They are expected to return on Monday-when some of them will go og short time. Besides being a protest against redundancy it was also a reaction against the management's refusal to dispense with a four-Hour \"twilight\" shift-mainly of women. A BMC spokesman ex- plained that without the part-time shift, which prepares work for the next day, there would be short time, The strike would pmbarras no one as far as supplel were con. cerned, said BMC, The men felt that women should not work for \"pin money\" In the evenings wh9le men were on short time. Hint of Stike at Tractors Branch Hints that the Tractors and Transmissions Branch - 2,000 workers of which walked out on Wednesday and voted unanimously for a \"no redundancy\" policy- would strike when redundancy takes effect In November were made yesterday by Mr. Arthur Harper, th bellierent shop stewards' convener, With most of the leading Midlands trade union officer in STI short time, and rdu York attending the monthly central conference of unions, information about bow attitudes might be changing under pressure from the shop flor for work sharing was limited. However, the local leadership of the National Union of Vehicle Builders, which in the past has been extremely militant, was able on Thursday night to restrain 500 angry shop stewards from pressing S\"no redundancy at any price\" vote against the wishes of the platform. The resolution passed was to re- sist redundancy \"with all the power at our command\" and to leave it to the National Executive which meets this week-end-to decide what action to take. While union policy is to share available work rather than accept redund- ancy, Mr-Alf Roberts, the general secretary, has expressed concern about calling for strike action. While Mr. Fnk Cosino, militaBt attitude, he is leaving it to his local officers-in effect, Mr. Harry Urwi, the Midlands dis. rit secretary-to decide what should be done, Mr. Urwin is known to believe that strike action will not solve the economic situation, which is at the root of the industry's troubles. Restraining the Militants The ABU whose local secretary, Mr. Syd Crsswell, Is also secretarv of the Midlands branch of the confederatlon of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, will also be restraining the militants, Nevertheless, reaction gainst re dundancy is strong and widespread. and the mmediate test will disclose :hether or not, in the pat two or three years, union offials have been able to strengthen their authority over the shop floor. There is obviously going to be a close examination, factory by sac. tory, of BMC's short time and redundancy plane, and some modi. loations will undoubtedly be called for, Union resistance will be toun. No short time working has been announced yet in BMC' Press Steel-Pisher factories, but - reduced working week, It is under. stood, may be introduced shortly at the Swindon plant, which has a labour force of 6.000. mian ela In radio Pae 9",

This is being presented as the next stage in a gradual dis- engagement from Commonwealth activities, which began with 1 Zambia's decision to stay rway from the Commonwealth Games in Jamaica last month. But the Zambian Cabinet may this week-nd decide to go further, and either break off diplomatic relations witb Brital or withdraw F' ourt Possibilities Mr. Simon Kapwepw. the Forei n Minister, who ha r peatedly denounced Mr. Harold Wilson as a racialist, is understood to favqur some such action, while Mr. Wina is believed to be against it. There is no indication how the decision of President Kaunda and his Cabinet will turn out, but there are four possibilities:- 1-Zambia may break off relations with Britain, as Tanzania did, on, the grounds that her dissatis. faction Is not with the Common. wealth-most of whose members agre with her-but only with Britain. 2-She may leave the Common. wealth on principl, as South Africa did, but retain links with Britain, on grounds of economic advantage, and so as not to weaken cooperation on sanctions against Rhodesia. 3-She may leave the Sterling Are, taking with her some Â£82mu. o sterling balances. But Mr. Wina has said that political considerations need not necessarily affect her decision on Sterling Area membership, and he has under* taken to inform Britain well in advance if she withdraws. 4-She may continue the present policy of gradual disengage. ment, but this would not be so effective or immediate a gesture as a sharp break just after the Commonwealth Conference. Zambia may wish to gaiq com. ploet freedom of manoeuvre when Mr. Kapwepwe goes to the United Nations in New York on Tuesday for the opening of the General Assembly.

Not only has the equity market had to cope with a dismal level of turnover but also the BMC redundancies. Nonetheless it has shown little inclination to nose- dive. A rise in the fist two days was followed by a sharp drop on BMC on Wednesday and a bounce back Thursday and yesterday. The result is the index is 4.7 points to the good on the week at 305.6, having risen 1.4 points yesterday. More Steam In contrast for the first time for months gilts had a good week and still look as though they have steam left. The rise yesterday came mainly in the mediums where prices were up to % better. The long tap also shifted up 4 to Â£84%. The authorities must be pleased with any opportunity to sell off stock particularly if steel nationalisation, and the gilt issues accompanying it, are to eventually appear on the scene. Thus though the revival in interest in gilts may be a tender plant as yet, there is every reason to expect it to be carefully nurtured. Naturally as long as gilts stay in their present shape the chances of a good response to the ICI loan remain high. Already the industrial loan and debenture market has taken a turn for the better and unless something nasty happens it looks as though ICI is heading for a premium, current estimates varying up to 5. Furness Withy The profits split in the Furness Withy report shows how badly the Furness side did last year. For while shipping profits dropped sharply from Â£2m. to Â£284,000 pre. tax, Royal Mail was chipping in around Â£300,000 or so for the first time, leaving the rest catching a bad cold, largely in Australia and New Zealand. At the same time the engineering and broking activities put up a ood per- formance with a rise 'from3t a , to Â£196,000 before tax. Buthopesr that thi and Royal Mail will bail the group out this year must be faint since the losses from the sea- men's strike, though unquantified, \" will make a serious impact on the results for the current period.\" This leaves Furness Withy with its investments to provide all the interest These are standing in the balance-sheet at a market and net book value of Â£11.38m. producing in a normal year around Â£770,000 pross, and around 7 points of earn. ngs compared with the 10 per cent. dividend. What Is more extracting the investment side from the equation leaves the rest of Fumess selling at one more than about 4i times earnings after a full tax charge (which Is unlikely this year). And if this Is not enough to give the share price at 24s 7d some. thing to lean on, then there are always the assets worth 80s a share ex the Investments which add a further 23s a share to the sum- quite a discount even for a shipping company. See also PagO 10, G. B. Brittoi 0. B. Britton's share price has gone steadily ex-glamour this year dropping from the peak of 4 in 1965 to its current \"low\" of 29s 6d. But it has done no more than keep in step with events. The rapid rise in profits and earnings was already petering out last year. Now profits i the first six months of the current year a down from Â£511,000 to Â£475,000, and ther may not be the seasonal rise in the second half One trouble is the way leather prices have umped 30 per cent. compared with .last year while competition and the freeze stops Britton raisin prices. Sales have not been the problem so far- Britton's were up 15 pe cent. in the first six months and are still holding, but how long it can stay better than average is another point with retailers reluctant to build up stocks. Thus the extra capacity brought in at the end of last year is doing little more than raise depreciation, and hence the chairman's gloomy thoughts about the rest of the year. Simply doing no better than the first half would suggest pre-tax profits of Â£950,000 against Â£1.2m. and earnings of 51.S against 65.6 per cent. compared withthhe 32% per cent. dividend Britton may not have much to offer in the immediate future, but when the cycle moves up again it may be seen to have its old touch The shares selling at 11.2 times prospective earnings with a 5s per cent yield are striking a fair balance between these two con- siderations. See also Page 10 Second Premier Consolidated Trust, another par- ticipator in Second Premier, has not had its accounts qualified by the auditors as Rediffusion did. Instead, and much more satisfac- torily, the three directors who took up 28,000 of the Is shares at par in Second Premier have decided to \"Ã½hold themselves accontable to the company for any profit which may accrue to them\" from these holdings. Since Consolidated's subscription to the Second Premier debenture was crucial to the success of the scheme it is only fair it should take the profits, And with the deferred having a break. up value of 16s Sd at te end of last year these profits are worth having. But quite as important is the way Consolidated's decision is bound to reopen the position of the other participators in Second Premier. Rediffusion and BET are the big ones of course. They have already brushed aside those shareholders, including the institu. tions, who thought the matter should be put to the vote, as well as producing legal opinion to show that the directors involved are not accountable for the profits to the company. Both attitudes should be revered and the sooner the better, Se also Page t1",

   "text_content" : "A number of other influences have also worked in favour of gilt- edged. In its quarterly bulletin, the Bank of England has forecast a substantial improvement in the balance of payments, with a sur- plus in 1967, and it claims already to see signs of a slight easing in the domestic economy. Defla- tionary moves in the U.S. should help arrest rising world interest rates. Britain's trade gap has been narrowed from Â£49m. in July to Â£15m. in August. On Wednesday, British Funds had their best day for four years, and on the week show gains up to 30s. The pace of the advance has slackened be- cause, owing to the rise in prices, supplies of the Government's \"long\" tap, 6 per cent. Funding, 1993, can now be called on at the ,improved level of prices. Equities began the week well, with a 6.4 rally in the share index up to Tuesday, but then weakened sharply on Wednesday on the re- dundancies in the motor industry but have been steadier since. The index ends the week 4.7 to the good at 305.6. This must be reckoned a good performance in view of the discouraging news from industry, which has included lower interim profits from many companies. Selling has been small, and it now looks as though sales to pay off overdrafts as a result of the bank squeeze on private borrowers are no longer a major factor in the market. The more confident behaviour of Wall Street has helped London.",

Moatecatnu showed little change at Lire 1,835 (Lire 1,844), despite reports that Royal Dutch/Shell planned to with- draw from the joint Montuhell petrochemical group. Olivetti was unchanged at Lire 3,290. ZURICR-The market closed rregular, after an initial spurt. aakglle aft closed down Sw..20 at Sw.Ers.2,490. later- _~__ bandel jumped Sw.Prs.960 to Sw.Frs.4,920 following the ex- change offer, which is the first move towards a merger, probably next year, . PARIS-The market was depressed this week. Dealers showed little reaction either to a speech by the Finance Minister favouing a gradual slackening of the price freeze or to the 1967 budget. Some mid.week demand reflected Wall Street's gains, and bargain hunting at current low price levels, but this lacked follow- through. Aqaitane closed at Frs.552 against Frs.548, Esso at Frs.238.10 agmanst Frs.246.50 and Pechiney at Frs.200 against Fra.193. BUP closed at Frs.208 against Pra.185.10 and Sues at Frs.426.90 against Frs.447. A Suez spokesman said that Friday reports that the com- pany would absorb BUP (Banque de rUnlon Parieane) were pre mature. AMSTERDAM - The market was generally firm on Wall Street's better performance, with improved local and foreign buying interest. Ako rose Fls.5 to Fls.66.85, and Hoogovens was up 39 points to 345. Royal Dutch closed SIs4.65 higher at Fls.121.15, and Unilever was up Fls.5.35 at Fls.87.30. Plilips was up Fls.1.80 at ls.93.40.

The recent harder tendency in leading equities was maintained, but features were few and far between and dealings were .ain abysmally low at 6.818. Continued firmness in British Funds agali provided the market highliht and although the upward irend in this section hesitated after the announcement of the Farmer' Loan, the tone at the close was till very firm. Unchanged yester- day, the F.T. Government Securities index, at 74.47, shows ts largest weekly rise (1.17) since the week ending November 2, 1962, when it put on 1.43. Helped by the continued rally on Wall Street overnight, leading equities went better from the start on small investment support and ome bear closing and at noon THi SPINA A. TIES Industrial Ordinary share index was showing a rise of 1.7 Prices came bac later, however, when the tone became subdued by lack of activity. ihe index ended at 305.6, up 1.4 on the day, and 4.7 higher on the week during which the cheerful news of the fresh backing for sterling and the encouraging Bank of England view of the balance of payments position have been pull- ng against the redundancy troubles facing the motor industry, par- ticularly BMC. Rises in all F.T.-quoted stocks amounted to 16 per cent. against falls of 9 per cent Official mark- ings yesterday were below 7,000 ;or the second day running, and for the second week in succession one has to go back to the week ending January 24. 1958 (when marking totalled 35,806), to find a comparably low total to the week's bargains of35,813. Funds Remain Firm Although business in British Funds tended to slacken after the active and strong conditions of the pest few days, the tone of the market remained very firm indeed. On the appearance of the new Â£17m. 7j per cent. Agi- cultural Mortgage Loan, dealers lowered prices n the early hours by A or 1. Little stock came on offer, however and. with further institu- tional demand developing in the afternoon, the initial declines wer erased and replaced with scattered gains extending to 1. Medium-dated stocks attracted most attention with Conversion 5* per cent., 1974, advancing afresh to 89*, a gain of i on the day and a rise of 1t on the week. Long-dated and undated issues usually ended without change, but there was further switch. ing into the 6 per cent.

   "text_content" : "THE MOST INTERESTING feature of the Petroleum In* formation Bureau's statistics on U.K. oil consumption, out this week, is that sales of the best grades of petrol through the lling stations increased by 8.4 per cent. over the correspond- ing period In 1965. At the same time sales of the regular grades fell by 4.1 per cent. to just over Im. tons. Thus both grades have reversed the trend which they have been following for some time. This does not mean a dramatic change in the buying habits of the motoring public. The biggest selling grades are still the ordinary premiums. such as Shell. Esso Extra. and BP Super, which are increasing their share of the market at the expense of both of the others with an increase of 12.9 per cent. to 3.3m. tons. But it does mean that motorists seem to be becoming less price conscious than they were. If the best grades continue to increase their sales some inter- esting arguments are likely to result among the men respon- sible for the companies' market- ing policies. At present there are broadly speaking two schools of thought about the effect of rising prices. One says that the more prices go up t more interested motorists be. come in getting value for their money and so they go for the cheapest available rand or grade. The other holds the view that higher prices make people more concerned than ever to buy the best, even if it does cost a few pennies a gallon more. It is too early to say which is right and in any case the answer will not be clear cut. But at the moment it looks ts if the second school of thouht is having the best of the argument. Petrol however is now a relatively unimportant product in this country. It is the heavy oll$s-%.: diecl. and fuel oil- whcl really matter. At 21.3m. tons they were 8.8 per cent. up on this time last year, and accounted for well over half the total U.K. oil onsumption of 36.9m. tons.",

   "text_content" : "CUNARD'S SALE. for Â£11m. cash, to BOAC of its 30 per cent. interest in BOAC- Cunard inevitably will have some shareholders demanding that the money-which is equivalent to 17s 8d per share against the stock exchange valuation of about 13s-should be distributed to shareholders. Valid Argument This is a valid argumneit and Sir Basil Smallpeice, the chair- man, has gonie to some pains to explain why the money should be retained in the Cunard group. Basically the argument now is: Should Cunard continue as a shipping company or should it be wound up? With- out the use of the Â£1 %m. re- ceived from the sale of its air- craft interest it is doubtful that Cunard could remain for long as a shipping company. Cunard, as a result of the drain upon its group earnings of its passenger shipping interests, has nothing left now in the \"kitty.\" The Â£11 m. is needed desperately by Cunard to buy its share o' the new develop. ment -ir intertational cargo transport - containerisation. This is the transport, virtually from door-to-door of cargo with no independent handling of goods except in the container etween the seller and the customer. It is known that Sir Basil re- gards the containership aspect of Canard's future -\" con. tainerisation \"-as of tremen- dous importance. He is saddled with the passenger fleet and the need to accept the Q.4, costing between Â£25m. and Â£30m. but he believes that Cunard's profit- able future lies in the cargo field. Possible Cost As a member of Associated Containers Transportation, Cunard believes that a consider- able amount of money will be needed within the next few years to build container ships, invest in inland cargo depots, and take an interest in the road and rail transport links involved in a door-to-door \" international transport service. A containercargo ship may cost up to Â£2m. and Cunard, as member of the ACT conson tium is close to ordering one of these ships. If Cunard orders two, the capital investment of the company, together with orders for containers, may reach easily about Â£6m. The com- pany's need to involve itself in land transport-extending its financial interest beyond the sea link of a door-to-door transport operation -may necessitate the investment of several more mil- lions of pounds. Cash Demands In all, the Â£11%m. Cunard has taken out of BOAC-Cunard may be no more than the com- pany needs to meet its commit- ments in the container-ship sphere. If Cunard is to remain in the shipping business the Â£ll m. from the sale of the BOAC in- terest will be essential to meet container-ship cash demands. The first two or three years of a new venture in the transport field are seldom profitable and the whole venture could be dis- astrous if Cunard had to borrow money at current rate to finance its entry into con- tainerisation. ____",

   "text_content" : "After the scufflos over its attempts to include Brooklands in the fourway merger nearl a year ago, Plantation Hading as pro* duced good maiden results. Com- pared with a combined crop of 25.m. pounds and pre-'tax profits of the four separate companies (Brooklands, Henrietta, Chebong and Kampong) of some Â£424,000, PH has produced a crop of 26.25m. pounds. and with the help of slightly higher prices, ~pretax pro- fits of 496,000. Margins, there fore, look to have risen about %d to 4%d a pound. Annual Basis However, this profits figure is not strictly comparable. For a start it includes only nine months of Chembong, the extra three months makes a difference of Â£12,000 pre-tax. Moreover, there is the new loan stock, though only one month's interest has been charged in these figures, worth Â£3,515. Thus the comparable figure for last year is more like Â£511,500 before tax, reducing after a full year's loan stock to around Â£469,000. After minorities-largely 49 per cent. of Brooklands and 38 per cent, of Chembong--arnings look to be about 17% per cent., cum 1% points of overspill. With the interim paid bet the total divi- dend is 18% per cent. as forecast making the yield at 2s ld 17.9 per cent. This is quite a reason. able rating, particularly with rub. bers averaging 13.28 per cent., but there are some unanswered ques- tions for PH. To start with the dividend rate looks in some danger unless profits can be pushed up again. Here the fact that the group has around a quarter of its rubber acreage immature is less of an advantage than it looks at first sight with the rubber price weaken- ing over recent months, while the group gets only a small propor- tion of its income from oil palms, and most of the immature acreage here is very new. Secondly there is the question of what effect dissecting Brooklands will have on the rest of the group. For the Brooklands minority s holders the prospect of slling up a their \"half\" of the company is r underpnning the share price at Sjust over 4s. But until it becomes * clear what happens to PH's earn- if ngs ex the Brooklands minority- a In theory, of course. little should is happen-it would be unwise to g value PH on a less cautious basis. ) Another high-yielder is Malay I. lm the South Indian tea and rub- if ber producer. Its results for 1965-66 Sar also good. It had the making Sos higher profits with both tea and d rubr crops higher by over 13 per cent. and a slight drop in tea prices has been matched ba Id a pound rise in rubber ris. In the event the rise is from Â£1.14m. is to l.6m. pre-tax giving earnings a of 21.5 per cent. before overspill is relief. still unquantified. thanks a partly to the devaluation of the >f rupee. However the dividend is *e held at 22% per cent making yield y at 2s 84d 19 per cent n The trouble is Malayalam faces h as many problems as PH 'at the Smoment. For one thing devalua- e tion of the rupee upsets not only r calculation for overspill, but also d throws in doubt what the accounts ly will look like from now on-how 8 much tea does the company sell in pa London. and are the sterling pro- ceeds enough to generate the extra h rupees needed to meet the com- i- pany's higher dividend cost? More- st over the real sting in the tail of .9 the preliminary statement is that i- thanks to a strike since July. still b. unsettled, crops this year are going It to be down. This being the case. s- it is no wonder the shares yield o 19 per cent p Teas ip br Teas have been quiet this week. In Makum's results will only add to st the feeling of gloom, for profits n- are down from Â£199.000 to ti Â£155.000 before tax. Not as bad or- a fall as Namdang's. but bad is, enough to mean the dividend is cut te from 29.8 to 15 per cent- It is covered by earnings of 20 per cent.. fa but this is little consolation for the is share price, which at 12s 6d to p. yield only 12.3 per cent. looks to ty have plenty of downside potential.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR MINING EDITOR I FORECASTING short-term pri trends in Gold shares is a well- j nigh impossible task thes days. pr Who would have thought that is after the remarkable and swift of recovery from the shock news is of Dr. Verwoerd's assassination, pr Golds would have lost heart tU again in a plunge which lowered ire our index to a low for the year fn of 55.8 on Thunday. But there was some encouragement in yes- terday's rally. Meanwhile, there has been plenty of news on the base- ov metal front. The Australian be Mount Isa lead-zinc-copper re complex, for example, has made at a fine come-back with net group a earnings of SA16.8m. for the to year to June 30 compared with re only SA6.2m. in the strike-torn a previous year and SAl0.5 in tm 1963-64 when labour was peace- t ful but metal prices were lower. n Isa's present daily ore milling - rate is about 11,000 tons and it is hoped to achieve 16,000 tons 9t on completion of the ten-year expansion which has now taken is a big step forward with com- missionin of the new concen. t trator and deep-level K57 shaft. t For the past year holders are to fr receive a 16 per cent. total divi- dend against 10 per cent. last time and are promised 20 per n cent. for this year if all goes well. Torco success Exciting news for the copper industry generally has come with Aglo Ame a's decision after five years' intensive re- search to employ the \"Torco\" A process on a large scale at its A Copperbelt mines. \" Torco \"is A a major.break-through in the D treatment of \"difficult\" copper a orese c Its full success could make available the many millions of O tons of refractory copper ores o in the world which have so far 0 been left in the ground because their metal content could not be U extracted commercially by con- Jo ventional methods. Among other things, it strengthens hopes that RbodeKa-Katag's K flooded KaInsaasi mine will be brought back to life. K Copper is playing a bigger K part now in Rio Tino-ZIa Cor. ; poration's profit picture. Thanks p to the start of production in P, February at the big South Afri- R can Palabora mine and in April s at the two smaller Canadian s, properties, half-year profits have , shown a good increase which si is expected to gather pace in s, the current six months. T This is despite less investment T income arising from the re. T timing of dividend payments u and a fall, in line with metal __ __ ___ prices, of lead and zinc earn- ings. he latter have so far provided the world miinng and mdustrlal roup's major source of revenue, but this dependence is lessening now that the new projects such as Palabora and the Australian aluminium and iron ore ventures are coming to fruition. Not so bad The RTZ group's 32 per cent.. owned New Broken Hill has been more affected by the return to normal conditions after the previous boom in lead and zinc prices. Gross profits for this year are offcially reckoned to be about Â£6,7m., aginst Â£9.2m. in 1965. But thanks to the cushion of lower tax and royalties the estimated net profit is not too bad at Â£3.1m., against Â£3.2m. Despite strenuous efforts to emigrat, the company remains in the U.K tax sphere and this is a factor in the forecast divi. dend of 3s compared with last year's equivalent of 3s 8d. So, too. is the intention to finance from profits a new Â£2.8m. shaft which will be operational by 1972. On the anticipated pay- ment the shares at 34s still give a reasonable potential yield of 9 per cent The Malaysian tin group Troah now reckons that it will be unable to maintain the Is 6d dividend on its higher capital as was hoped when Charter Consolidated exercised an option on 1.7m. shares in April. The tin price, though still satis- factory, has since fallen by abou 160 a ton, and Charter has also exercised a 49 per cent. option on Tronh's all-impor tant expanding Suagel ldor subsidiary. Shareholders, however, may take heart from the improved Malaysian-lndonesian political situation and the still cood out- look for tin in the light of this group's long-term growth pros- pects. It is a pity, though. that chairman Mr. G. W. Simms could not give more definite guidance on the likely amount of the dividend reduction, which may be only small. Charter, together with Anglo American and De Beers, is widening its Canadian mining investment scope via Anglo Ameran Corporation of Canada. The latter holds the bulk of the three Anglo group colleague's Canadian invest- ments and further funds (S5m. out of a total S10m.) for its operations are being raised in Canada by a new De Beers sub- sidiary, Debbold (Canada).",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR LEGAL STAFF Under my lte wife's will I m left a life aterest worth about 11,000 a year In her e\"tate, but would like to tramsfer it to my daughter. Can this be done without me being responsible for Income or su- tax on It? Would the interest Sto my daughter be lable for estate duty hI the event of my death? There is no reason at all why you should not transfer your life interest in your wife's estate to your daughter. Thereafter, you would not in any event be liable for income-tax or sur-tax upon the income so transferred. We are uncertain whether you are in fact already enjoying the life interest or not; this may make a difference as to the precise method of transfer but not to the actual effect of the transfer. It may also make a difference to the duty position, because, in strict law, if you die within five years duty should be payable upon the capital pro- ducing the Â£1,000 per annum; there would be some relief if you lived for at least two years from the date of the transfer, more if three and still more if for four years thereafter, but the five year rule strictly operates. If, however (i) you never enjoy the life interest under the will and (ii) you can disclaim the interest, so that it goes to the person who would ave got the capital anyway, the Estate Duty Office does not normally require the payment of duty, even if you die within the five year period.",

Am I entitled to compensa. tion? Do you advise legal representation? We are uncertain from your letter whether (i) you bought the house, which had recently been erected or (ii) you bought a piece of land, and the builder then built the house for you. The legal situation is very differ- ent in the two cases. In the first case, the rule of the law is cveat emptor-let the buyer beware-and you would have no right in law to require the builder to rectify an~ defects, absence of any written ack- nowledgment, provide a perfect answer to any claim by your mother. On the other hand if she expressly releases the debt now and then were to die within i period of five years, there would be death duty complica- tions. Let sleeping dogs remain statute barred save and except so far as there might be some contract which warranted that the house had been built to a particular speci- fication. In this case, as also in (ii), you would be entitled to any damages caused to you by breach of, in the' first case, the warranty, and, in the second case, the implied warranty that the house would be erected in accordance with the specifica- tion and in any event in a work- manlike manner. The amount of the damages would be any actual loss to you, which would not directly relate to the nui- sance caused, but would relate to the diminished value of the fitted crpet, for -xample. We doubt whether, if you have a claim, it would be worth ptursuin very far; but if you are to pursue it we think you will have to consult a solfcitor. A few letters from him will not cost much; if matters are there- after to go further, he will give you an estimate of the cost. we said It had to comply with whatever formalities nish law rquired.

   "text_content" : "sy A GYPSY festival curiously connected with Christianity takes place net month, on October 2, at LeSaintes- Marles-de-la-Mer in the Camargue, the delta of the Rhone. It was here, according to legend, that Christianity came to France. Saint Mary Jacobe, sister of the Virgin, Saint Mary Salme sad their black servant Sarah, ae said to have been expelled from Palestine with the apostles immediately after the death of Christ. They took ship and, allowing wind and tide to do what they would-for their barque had neither oars nor sail-decided to settle at the first shore where it came to rest. Fate chose this spot at the mouth of the Rhone. To-day, twice a year gypsies from all over the world congre- gate here, and their reliquaries, which are kept in the Romanesque church, are brought down amid scenes of great excitement; while the gypsies visit the crypt from which the statue of the black servant Sarah is taken into the sea and anointed with salt water. Afterwards the statues of all three are carried in pro- cession and escorted by Camargue herdsmen, who take them into the water where they, too, perform the rites of asper- sion. Â£50 Traveller One of the problems for the Â£50 traveller to-day is to find a part of France which, not being fashionable and yet being in the Midi, combine economy with tourist interest-and bathing. For the reasons enumerated above, and below, the Camargue to-day is particu- larly attractive. As will be seen, a room can be had at Les- Saintes-Maries-de-!a-Mer in a reasonable one-star hotel like the Camille for Â£1 a night; and all the local amusements are cheap. The Camargue is a large, sandy plain of pools and marshes cut by several arms of the Rhone, of wide horizons, rushes and tamarisk trees. The salt water which impregnates its ponds and lagoons, and the subtropical climate, are respon- sible for a luxuriant vegetation of a semi-exotic kind. A large area has been set aside as a National Park-of interest to the ornithologist as a refuge for exotic birds such as the egret, flamingo, the Egyptian ibis and the Moroccan stork. The chief attraction, however, for the ordinary \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t tourist will probably be the bulls and wild horses, and the gardiens, the cow-boys who roam among the hards in their picturesque ostumes. The Camargue horse is of ancient lineage dating back, it is claimed, to Saracen times; and one of the most interesting sights is to watch these horses electing young bulls in the mautadus where they are grouped under the guidance of the ien. The horses cause the bullsto gallop so fast that they finally collapse from exhaustion, and can then be marked by their owners-a pro- cess known as the ferrade. One of the sports is for the younger gardiens to challenge the bulls to a bloodless bull-fight, catch- ing them by the horns and planting a cockade in the hair between the eyes. Rough Shooting For the sportsman, te Camargue offers some excellent rough shooting. Water-rail quail, snipe and macseuses ( la migratory sea-duck known in England as the scoter) pullulate; there are also red partridge and woodc6ck. The -portsman will fin4 the resident birds at their best on the itang de Berre it October; for th- marsh birds he should wait until the cold weather sets in before Christmas. With suitable introductions, a visitor can take part in the shooting, and a licence costs about 25s (further information from the Syndicat de 1'Initiative, Arles, Bouches-du-Rhone). The only places of any size in the Camargue are Les-Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer and Aigues- Mortes (although Mjanes in the interior has been much developed of late). They are no more than villages, and Aigues Mortes is one of the most beautiful 12th century walled places in France, its walls com- parable with those of Carcas- sonne Roman Remains Othe placesworth a visit for their typicalrovenal character are Sali de adon and Mejanes (where the enterprising Ricard organisation lets villas or cabanes to visitors), and of course Arles, the capital at the head of th delta, will be passed through and visited, for it con- tains some of the finest Roman remains in rance. In Les-Saintes'Mares-de-la- Mer, the Camille hotel has already been mentioned as suit- able for the Â£50 tourist (rooms from Â£1 a night); full pension here (bed and meals) is approxi- mately Â£2 12s. But-for eating -there are plenty of cheaper bstros. A better hote, the hAphores et Bruleur de Lup has singl rooms from 268, And full penson frin Â£4 a day. All these prises includd taxes and tips. To save foreign exchange the best way of reaching the Camargue is by flying (the ticket paid in England, no train meals, etc.). BEA are running a special reduced holiday fare to nearby Nice until October 31- Â£38 16s return, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays (valid one month). Otherwise the BEA fare return is Â£47 10s (valid one year).",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1966_0917_0006_003",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-17",
   "text_content" : "By A. G. L. HEi4YER Editor of Amateur Gadening THE TRUTH about garden chemi- ca. i rare simpe as the pro- tagonst one view or another sugges ve the question of hazard is not easy to define, and certaily cannot be indicated on every container of insecticide or fungicide by some simple colour scheme or marking, as has been suggested In a Private Member's One may think of hazard in terms of the amount of a chemical that would be necessary to do one serious harm. Scientists express this acute toxicity in terms of the quantity of the chemical required to kill half of a batch of animals to which It is administered. Since the larger the animal the larger the dose of poison it is likely to survive, this quantity is shown as the weight of chemical in milli- grammes per kilogramme of the body weight of the animal. This is known as the LD 50 for the chemical, and the higher the figure the less toxic the chemical is, for it means that more of it must be taken before the animal is killed. Recently some figures in these terms have been published in Scientific Horticulture for the acute toxicity of a range of familiar garden chemical and I am sure that some of them will surprise a. lot of gardeners. The LD 50 of derris is given as 130, which makes it rater more poisonous than BIC which is 200, and a good deal more poisonous than DDT which is 400. Pyrethrins. the active insecticidal chemicals in pyrthrum, come out at 570, whih make them about twice as poisonous as the fairly new systemic insecticide menazon, at 1,200. Malathion, which I sometimes hear criticised as a risky chemical to use, actually comes out at 1,400, which should make it one of the safest in this particular selection. 'Important Factor But of our acute toxicity is not the only thing to be considered in assess the hazards of chemicals. It were there would really not be much problem at all. But there are other factors just as important and a good deal mote difficult to assess. One is persistence, and allied to this is the matter of build up in the soil, the plant or the body. BHC and DDT are much more stable than derris or pyrethrum, which means that they are much more difficult to get rid of. In the soil they may remain for years, though this is influenced by the nature of the soil. They are persistent, also, in the fat of animals, and this is the major indictment against them. â¢ \" . . . IIÂ·II II I m Â·Â·-Â·-Â· Â· Yet even in this matter it is easy to get the facts wrong. Apparently the build-up In animals and human beings does not so on and on until a level is reached it which acute damage is done. After a while it strikes an equilibrium, and unless the quantities inested are very arge, this equlirium appears to be reached at a level well below the danger point. DT began to be used durinthe 1940's and soon after the war one of the principal insecticides for crop protection. Atcording to the same article in Scientific Horticul- ture Americans have been ingesting 0.184mg. DDT pr erson per day since 1947, but the actual level of DDT In their bodies has ot risen since 1950. Then it reached an equilibrium, well below any sup- posed danger level, and has remained there ever since. Other Objections There are two other perfectly valid objections to the careless or indiscriminate use of chemicals in the garden. One is that they interfere with the so-called \" balance of nature,\" the other that they may enable some organisms to build up resistance to the chemi- cals, so that they cease to be effective. Of course, man began to interfere with the balance of nature directly he began to culti- vate the land and keep domestic animals. By interfering with the natural course of events he has managed to increase his own popu- lation fantastically and, so long as he continues to do so he must attempt to wrest even greater crops from the soil Insects often breed very rapidly, generation following generation in a matter of days or even hours. Even to effective insecticides a few individuals in a huge population may have some natural resistance. They are the ones that are likely to survive spraying, and their off- spring may include a highetr pro- portion of resistant individUaIls This kind of forced selection can be checked by using the chemical sparingly so that some non-reis- tant insects will escape to inter- breed with the resistant individuals and keep the proportions of each at a more normal level. The conclusions which should be drawn from all these facts seem to be that insecticides and fungi- cides should only be used when really necessary, that they should never be applied in excess or for an unnecessary length of time, and that it is often wise to ring the changes with different chemicals, thereby reducing the risk of en- couraging resistance to any one chemical.",

It certainly is a capacious load compartment when the rear seats are folded away out of use, providing a flat platform nearly 5 feet 4 inches long and over 4Y feet across at its widest point Maximum height is 2 feet 6 inches (if all of this is filled it is of course essential to use the wing mirrors to retain rearward vision-a matter not all estate car drivers seem to appreciate). Saloon conversion The Triumph 2000 estate car is a conversion of the saloon body, and it is among the most successful of its kind. The tail- jate is in one piece, hinged at the top and with a counterbal- ancing spring to make lifting easy. A roof lamp comes on when this is done, or a door opened. I liked the way in which the rear-seat cushion folded over so as to protect the front passengers from shift- ing loads when the brakes were applied in emergency-this is often a weak point of estate cars. and a heavy case or simi- lar object slithering forward in- to the front seats can be a menace. Apart from the body, the estate car is the same in its me nism as the Triumph saloon 2000, with the exception that, being a hundredweight heavier, it requires a slightly lower back axle ratio, and maximum speed, at a claimed 92 mph, is 3 mph lower than that of the saloon. Child-proof handle Wilmot Breeden, one of the largest suppliers of \" hardware \" for cars, has come up with a child-proof interior door handle. It has a lock built in and, when the key is turned, the handle moves but does not open the door. Price is 13s for can with a normal %-inch-square spindle, and a converter for A-inch spindles costs 2s Id extra. Most rages and accessory shops can supply, but the manufacturer's address is 13-14, Oxford Street, Birming- ham 5. . ; - - . - .",

A conemporary of Noverre, Titus was spending his declining years industriously copy- ing other men's ballets for his Russian audience, and when deonov, the director of the Imperial Theatres, asked .for a novelty for the ballerina Andreya- no Titus wet to Paris, saw rii'triumph, nd returned to stage his own reconstruction of it. This was to serve for several visiting ballerine first Gran in 1842, and then Elssler; and when Marius Petipa ar-ved as a soloist at the Maryinsky m 1848 he appeared in his then mrom cele- brated brother Lucien's created role of Albrecht, with Andra- nova. Perrot spent the years from 1849-1858 tn St. Petersburg, and in 1850 Gris at last made her Russian dbut in Gfselle 'but there is no record of Perrot re-sta the work for her, since Petipa sates that it was his own version that was used. Thereafter various alterations were made in the presetatin, but the efinitive prodtion was set by Petipa in 1899. It is this version that we know with the Royal Ballet. in Nicholas Sergeyev's 1933 rvival and it is plainly the basis for the current Kirov stain. T two productions in fact. diffr very little in outline, and not much more in detal. The Kirov offer the Bacchus sequence in Act I, but not the crowning of Giselle as Queen of the vintage, there are certain variants in the Wils' dances, a few others in the corps de ballet work, but the larger changes are those of manner rather than matter. Briefly they reside in showing Hilarion (here called Hans) as a more sympathetic character, in the excision of most of the mime sequences, in the interpolated variation (to a dull page of Minkue) for Albrecht in Act I, and in the differences in the peasant pas de deux. In all other respects, the two versions show a remark able similarity, notably in the feeble dramatics of Act II and in doesdac it. But last night's Glsell, Natalia Makarova, ld deserve the role in anycompany. t, as a ItO than a K:irov prigasl nery is klbrecht Act I, hmanor hunolois a few brecht'e of the eyfaire to det version. caced I allerine :reahte Sthere, n, and t would .tasia nimet' wolate (or It, icy, a Nataua 'Mkarova and YurI Soloyev ing princeling, but there are few depths to the characterisation.

A final note, though, must be made of the list of characters as given in the prograjme, which included such fascinating newcomers as \"Albrecht's Bride\"; Wilfride; Hertzog; Myrtle; and Monna. Apart from feeling that I was caught tp in an Aldwych farce, I wonder whatever happened to Albrecht's betrothed, Bathilde; Wilfrid; the Duke of Courland; Myrtha; and Moyna.",

   "text_content" : "CONSIDERING the sort of company news that has been appearing recently-notably, of course, the news of widespread short-time working at British Motor, with dismissals to follow -the stock market has been remarkably firm. The BMC announcement, like that from Imperial Chemical in the pre. vious week, caused a temporary setback in prices, but the rally that began after the August Bank Holiday has not yet petered out and the Industrial Ordinary index has remained determinedly above 300. What is more, the gilt-edged market has suddenly come to life again-the Govern. ment Securities index rising more sharply on Wednesday than for four years past. Mainly Responsible Two events not entirely un- connected with one another, President Johnson's decision to raise taxes and the Federal Re. serve Board's decision to extend the range of swap facilities between central banks, are mainly responsible for this show of firmness. The former has influenced British equity prices through the behaviour of Wall Street, which has shot up in the past few days. It seems a little odd, on the face of it, that a decision to raise company taxa- tion-two special tax incentives for investment in plant and building are to be suspended for 15 months-should make Ameri- can investors throw their caps in the air. The point is, of course, that the steep decline in stock prices has been caused by a steep and apparently unending rise in rates of interest. The new tax increase, which many U.S. economists have been urging for some months past, is specific.lly designed to counter inflationary torces by fiscal means and make it possible to rely less heavily on monetary policy, In a letter to the Federal Reserve, in fact, the President appealed to the banking system to ration credit more fairly and bring down interest rates from their present high levels as soon as possible. Bond Sales Moreover, the Administration proposes to take its own weight off the capital market to some extent by suspending sales of bonds by various government- financed public agencies. It will probably not be easy to get rates down far until the New Year when, with the congressional elections out of the way, the Administration will feel better able to make any major tax changes the state of the economy seems to call for. But the inten. tion is clearly to put a stop to a trend that was not only making life difficult for less powerful borrowers but creating wide. spread anxiety that the boom might suddenly collapse Into an old-atyle recesson, Wall Street's relief, which has infected London, is basically due to a feeling that the U.S. economy is back under control. o The tightness of credit in th U.S. has had repercussion- througho t the world, and tth would have been of some ssistance to the pound. But the extension of the international ..etwork of swaps, under which central bankers make lines of credit available to one another for offsetting the effects of private capital movements across the exchanges, has been of greater assistance still, The pound was ripe for a rise. It had been grossly oversold, yet had made o real recovery since the July measures were announced. The Baik of ear land Bulletin for September which forecast a substantial balance of payments surplus next year, seemed toh be borne out by the simultaneous publica. tion of the payments figures for the second quarter and the trad figures for August-both of which showed a certain (if rather superficial) improvement. When the announcement came, there ftre, that the swap network wat to be increased from 52,800mt to S4500m. and that Britain'l drawing rights obu the U.S. ha teen increased from $7o0m. to S1,350m., the exchange rate ros- harply at once. If itis too early yet to say tha the tide has turned or sterling, the moment of turn ng may not nowo be very far on. SteriKn Support The possibility that the pound may now be stronger and that the risk of a further rise in interest rates may be less great has obvious implications for the silt-edged market. There are plenty of industrial cborrowers still waiting to raise fixed-interest capital, and yields are unlikely to drop quickly: but once the turn seems to have come. insti. tutional investors will not be slow to take advantage of prices that seem low by the standards of the past. Any improvement in gilt-edged moreover will tend to underpin the market n equi- ties. VYet it would be rash to sun- pose that the equity market as a whole is yet due for a pro. longed recovery. The redundan- cies at British Motor are not typical, ven of the car industry -the company it short of new car models and has run into trouble with commercial vehicles-but they are one sian of the deflation that Is only lust boginning to appear and will in- evItably become more wide- spread. Most company news is Ircady discouraging and is lIkely to et worse before it Im- *roves. But it is arguable that. after its sharp fall. the market is 'eainning to find its feel again She odds are that for some time to come, until the future be :omes clearer, it Will continue to move up and down around th 300-mark.",

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORDON TETHER WHEN I LAST reviewed the sav- ings scene ,in this column some weeks ago, I suggested that the long-awaited turn in the interest rates tide might not be so very far away-so noar, in fact, that it might be unwise for savers to wait too long before taking advantage of the bargain terms on which in- vestments were being offered in the gilt-.dged basement. It seems to me that this message has been underlined by the events of the past week or two. SThere' is, to begin with, that weighty new swap credit deal arranged between the central banks of th'imajor commercial countries to fortify the world's financial structure against the pressures that may be imposed on it by the inter' national Interest rates war which has been merrily developing over the past six months. Up to the time of the unveiling of this mas. sive new colaboration exercise. at had looked very much as though the upward pressure British interest rates had ben under on external account might increase rather than diminish in the months ahead. Thus the tendency for the U.S. to move from the defensive to the offensive in the war was clearly destined to give additional en. couragement to hot money funds t1 move out of London to forein centres on interst arbitrags account. And with the revival of confindnce i the IÂ£ till 4howine few signs of materialasing. it was not inuonclvable that the U.K II II I III I i i T I f II I I II I v- authorities would eventually do. ne cide that it would be necessary to he jack British interest rates up to even higher levels, to prevent a new st threat to the Â£ emerging. Y We cannot, of course, be quite it certain that things will not work it out in this way even now. For, .a the decision to reinforce the inter- Snational liquidity structure annot be binterpreted to mean that a for- *e mal truce has been established on o the Interest rates front However, \" the fact that it has been acknow t ledged that the threat to the world's monetary health from this diro- tion has become sufficiently serious to call for the rection of crash s barriers strongly sugests that the 10 danger of allowing the fighting to al continue has also been recognised.

Sheila Black thinks there might be. THE CARDIN LINE built to meet demand for his designs and other niodern men- wear. Calico Printers' Association is sticking to its target of between 250 and 300 retail shops under the Harry Fenton name. More than 60 are already operating Sand the company has budgeted Sabout Â£1m. a year for the next two or three years to develop the menswear side. CPA took over Sthe Rael Brook shirt business last year and put Mr. Rael-Brook in charge of the Fenton division and its manufacturing suppliers. Home's has filled the gap between school uniforms and adult wear by featuring, the \"biggest-over\" collection of leisure clothes for \"elder brothers \" with \" op-art and pop. art atmosphere.\" Aquascutum, export doyen of the business, is E attracting its increased demand mainly from the U.S. Burberry's, E \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Swithout forsaking its traditional clientele, has also climbed on the style wagon with younger designs, and, any time now, we can I expect a masculine version of the swinging 'Miss Selfridge \" in , Oxford Street. 1 Men probably spend each year something between Â£1,150m. and SÂ£,200m. all told on their clothes r from head to toe, which is pretty Smuch the same as their feminine , counterparts. Since most of their s garments cost more than I women's do, this does not imply ., that they ring the changes as :ofte, but it show. a marked increase over theast six years- many put it at around Â£500m. to 'Â£60tm. a jear at the end Oi the fifties. However, the figure remains vague so long as there are so many small tailors and tailoring firms whose business returns are not sought by those who compile the statistics and whose turnovers escape even the most conscientious researchers. This year, however, the steady boom has almost certainly levelled out. Both manufacturers' deliveries and retail sales are generally much the same as for last year up to the end of the first six months, but 1965 was gener- ally acknowledged to be a record. Certainly, it must have been if sales run in parallel with adver- tising expenditure-last year's Â£lm. was roughly double that of 1964. Generally speaking, the trade is far from disappointed with the year's progress so far and had, indeed, expected a slow-down after so many years of rising sales. The universal expansion programmes are considered to b= setting down solid platforms from which another series of sales increases will be launched in about two years' time. ICI Fibres forecasts that shirt demand will \"rocket to annual sales of about.J100m. shirts by 970 \" (men bought only 70rm. last year). The basis of such hopes is the population \" bulge\" which is swelling the consumer market by so many men in their late teens and early twenties. This at group is said to account for about a third of all clothing ex- penditure and it is thought that they will hold their p lction for varied and extensive ward- robes all their lives, while young men who succeed them may have even more voracious appetites for the peacock parade of styles that come from the high street shops as well as from Carnaby Street these days. The supposition must be, of course, that the teens and twenties of this and the coming years will have as much money to spare as their predecessors, which may not prove to be the ase. Thereis alo the point that the boom has generated consider- ably more competition than most leading and individual con. cerns have ever been up against. E'ven women's fashion manufac- turers and designers are planning male collections. Company re- sults this year have provided proof of growth but with con- siderably squeezed margins. Cautious reservations about the future have been creeping into many reports recently-even from such concerns as the ebul- lient and still developing Hep- worths and Montague Burton. Besides intensified competition, the industry is also faced with problems arising out of .the stimulant to sales it has so suc- cessfully engendered - namely, the fashion element. While it is beyond doubt that changing lines,' fabrics and colours have tempted more customers to spend more, it is also true that these changes have considerably fragmented pio- duction programmes in an industry where a comparatively * limited amount of automation is possible and where there is still a strong craft element allied d to a shortage of new labour to - fill the gaps. Not only are there 0 frequently changing fashions, Ie but also a plethora of different- â¢e occasion clothes. \"e Indeed, there has been a A id tendency to categorise beach, is sports, leisure, informal and te other wear into separate com- id partments, thus creating the need te for separate promotions and marketing ventures and so build- ly ing up the costs of most sales ly aids. In some cases, there is s' evidence of what amounts to re a kind of industrial self- r strangulation-for example, the st firm which advertises rainwear t-r as being indistinguishable from d. overcoats is surely hitting one if of its divisions to support r another. And there are similar 's cases in other garment sectors. as In ten days, the industry will meet atHarrogate for this year's se convention. Among the discus- ie sions will be one on men's d, clothing in the 1980's. If current no trends continiu to be developed :g along variety lines, the man of a the 80's will need to change his )e clothes almost every hour on the as hour and would hardly dare )f appear twice in the same outfit ud -a temptation offered to women 31 by manufacturers when the rt feminine fashion industry was al building up, and fortunately iy reasonably well resisted even by 0. the weaker sex. Meanwhile, the man of 1967 et will be gratified to know that he is still has a mind of his own and ,y largely rejected the double- is breasted suit designed and pro- eg moted for him ltas year. \"There )r are,\" I am informed,\" still a few x- about but it didn't catch on.\" at The single-breasted suit should a be lean and long, with four d- buttons and fastening high, cut ig on Norfolk jacket lines with half. ve belts and centre-back slits. as Trousers less narrow, coats are es not so brief, materials have et obvious or subtle check patterns, )y large or small. On reflection, this is much as forecast for 1962, of and 1963, and 1964, and 1965. id And, on further reflection, men rg do go on looking pretty much ey the way they have for all those s, years. Obviously they are built he of sterner stuff.",

Meanwhile, the behaviour of the gilt-.dged market during the past week or two does quggest that the British authorities have been per. suaded that the work of extricatin the country from the crisis would at this tage be assisted rather than Impeded by a tendency for rates to move back a little from their recent peaks in this part of the field at least.

   "text_content" : "By JNATHAN'RAD cE 177-:\" I.E b taxation are excluded from the freeze. However, considering the difficulty which insurance com- panies have had to raise pre miumt, despite the ever-increas ing cost of claims, it seems clear that SET by itself is not oipU to be used as the reason for raising premiums further. The companies are likely to do all they can to swallow the extra cost. In the short term this is going to be extremely dilfcult. In the longer term, despite the determinedmoves already made to ptune staff and raise their productivity, the insurance com- panies would readily admit that they still have plnty of scope for cutting costs. Progress Varied There is a limit, of course, to the control which insurance companies have over their own fate. The cost of ctaims amounts to anything from 55 per cent. to 90 per cent. of premiums, Although perhaps the insurance world has been too fatalistic about the ever- rising amount they have to pay out, a few major fires can cancel out years of hard work spent trimming administrative costs. But this means that the insurance companies should work all the harder to keep down those costs which can be controlled. Progress has been varied.. After the last main round of merge;; which took place during 1959-60. com- puters and quill pens were, in some cases, foundto be working side by side. The statistics show what pro- gress has been made. Over the last 10 years the premium in- come of members of the British Insurance Association (account- ing for 80 per cent. of home and overseas business) has risen by 112 per cent. while staff num- bers have only gone up by 18 percent. This is not as good as it looks, since the volume of busihness b s not, owing to 1. *ue Ammercaa unmon group has been able to trim the num. ber of its staff by over 20 per cent. in the last v years. With competition sti fierce more mergers are on cards. Mergers brin their organisa tional problems (and by no meani all have k to such a drastic dr4p in staff numbers as that' t the Commercial Union), and can take a good many years to diest. Royal Inurance will only finish integratng the braches of the Rya lobe and London and Lancashire by next yearI . But the ned to integrate differing systems of operation appears to have stimulated a good deal of self- analysis by insurance com- panies. The Royal. for instance was one of the ealist com- panies to acquire a formal organisation and methods de- partment as a result of the Royal-Globe merger. SMajor Effort Norwich Union, one of the largest mutual life offices, is an example of a company which over the last four to five years has made a major effort to examine its costs in detail. As a result over the last four years it has been able steadily to reduce its staff and, just as important for SET, to raise the proportion of female employees from 43 per cent. to 48 per cent. Admitting that office costing is still in its infancy, the Norwich Union approach over the last five years has been to give free rein to its 0 and M staff, working hand in hand with a statistical team to cost each underwriting and administrative operation. As the head of its 0 and M effort put it, PFor too long insurance has regarded tself as something specia. We are showing that is not.\" But costing and budgetary ool is only one side of the picture. T.;' rectifying of mistakes i one major source of expense perhaps amounting to 2 per cent of the total. And when computers ae involved mistakes become very expensv indeed. This leads to the question of supervision and training (Norwich Union has its own training cbool), to The Sim Aliance oaeis at HoEa m.n, Susem. which aU rlsurance companies are paying a good deal of attention, particularly where, like Commercial Union, they are pursing a policy of maximum decentralisation. It is this kind of humdrum, yet detailed self-analysis, which together with the post-merger rationalisations is really making an impact on insurance com- pany costs. The moving of headquarters statf out of London-Sun Alliance build. ing at Horsham, and others, stih as Eagle Star and North- ern and Employers, are making a similar journey-is also prov- ing a good money sayer. The much vaunted effects of moving -into the computer age have been to increase speed and efficiency rather than lower costs (at this stage at any rate). By the middle of this year the insurance industry had 83 com- puters installed, with 12 more on order not a spectacular number considering the possi- bilities-\" Almost every opera- tion in insurance can be com- puterised.\" ote enthusiast said. And a good many of these machines cost well under six figures. Progress has been widely varied. The earliest computer experiences took place in. the late 1950s and they were rich Sin eething trblesI, and ex- pense.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STA1F The difficulties of the foot- wear trade have brought lower profits to G. B. Brit in the first half and overshadow the rest of th year (see L Pa 1) Blw Kaos half year profits are also down and .P. Sa has sustained a check, while Loyd Retae rporting for the full year shows quite a drop. But Carpet MUanU riM u has had a good upturn in thesecond half. Carpet Manufacturing Last year started badly fr Carpet Mamuacturhi. After Six months, pre4ax profits from trad- ing were down from Â£300,000 to Â£222,000 only party cushioned by a rise in investment income. For the second half, the company was gambling heavily on a good ipring season, gearing up for a big push in sales of its woven' ts. Recent trade figures, however, ave shown that it was tufted, nt woven carpets that made all the running. CMC's interest in tufted is con- fined to its investment in Kosset. But CMC obviously had no need to worry about the general trend. A combination of good lines, hbu selling and its 8020 ratio of wool to man-made fibre s-ow throug in second half prots of 539.0 before tax against 0,; the trading contribution rose 35 per cent. So annual profits are Â£856,000 against Â£809,000 .and there are earnings of 35.8 per cent. for the 17N per cent. dividend. There can be no forecasts for 196667 but the yield of 7.7 per cent. and more particularly the P/E ratio of just 6.4 times are making allowance for that. Loyds Retailers In April last year. an offer of 16s per share for the \"A\" Ordinary was rejected by Loyds Retailers on the grounds that the net asset value was greater. Last November the chairman valued the shares around 30s, counting in the hire-purchase reserve. But on the strength of the latest results, shareholders must be looking back with regret for the price of the \"A\" now stands at 5s 9d. Pre-tax profits are down by 40 per cent. at Â£162,000, reflect ing higher costs and the probability that turnover only showed a slight 1 r I 1 t I 1 a a a d a a a a it a tÂ· y rt S1065,000 in the flist six months of the current year it s clear that these problems are farfrom solved. SA 50 cent. export ratio does not hep ch etither. Cm titon abroad is severe and the question of higher prices is almost irrel vant. Thus, until buildina activity turns up the group will have to depend increngly on the othei activities. Fortunately the trans r ission towef division is going reasonably well, while steel equip ment appears to be holding its own. But it is hard to see pro fits making much of a recovery ir t the remainder of the year, and a h best the 30 per cent. divoent Scould barely be covered. Thi! a would leave the shares yielding i per cent. at 17s and selling at 10. Stimes earnangs, which althougl e looking a bit generous is neverthe Sless realistic until the picture be a comes clearer. On the other hano e the shares could tecinically lay i claim to a lowe :P/E ratio it on a knew exactly, how much Blav t. Knox was writing off in researc y and development from year t4 it year. I I",

For the rest of the year the price freeze, together with diminished purchasing power, must adversely affect earnings, and the nominal pattern of a higher profit rate in the second half may not be achieved, says chairman Mr. .

   "text_content" : "SSir Brington Keville, chairman of Funes Withy and Co, says the effects of the seamen's strike will make a \"serious\" impact on results for the current period-which will this time cover eight months to =nd-1966. He tells members it is difficult to estimate the precise losses in- curred from the stoppage, which occurred after the close of the financial year under review, to April 30, 1966. Apart from the immediate loss of earnings during the strike, further losses are bein incurred 4ue to the necessity to rostion ships in tbe liner services. Royal Mail A \"useful contribution\" to profits was made in 196566 by Royal Mail Lines (acquired in Jy 16S) in a year when the surplus from other shipowning activities suffered a sharp setc ue mainly to incr operating costs, particularly in the Australian and New Zealand services. Results of the non.shipping activities are described as \"encourag. ing\"; light ngineering, insurance broking and l trading all showed a matera. imsrovement, and the British Maritime Trust roup of investment companies \"ontinues its valuable cotribution.\" The group surplus, as stated on August 23. fell from Â£2,808,097 to Â£1A4,076, and the dividend is cut by 1' per cent. to 10 per cent. Of the surplus, shipping, including ownership and operation of ships, ship agency and stevedoring, contri- buted Â£283.918 (Â£2,001t769), engineer. ing, general trading and insurance broking Â£196,296 (Â£38 348), trade investments Â£570,433 (Â£489,265), and other investments Â£361,429 (Â£278,715). On unitisation of cargo, the dhair- man shares the general opinion that in order to keep costs \" within reason- able bounds.\" general cargo ships of the future must be designed and operated in such a way as to enable them to sped a very much greater proportion o their life at sea Furness, as known, has joined with Alfred Holt, British and Common. wealth, and P. and 0, to form Over- seas Containers, the management of which has for some time been con* ducting intensive research into the possibilities of unitisation and con. tainerisation.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter THE BUILDING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATION yesterday issued a statement outlining some of the difficulties which can be expected from its recommendation that mortgage rates should not be raised from 6% to 7% per cent. until January 1. It pointed out that the Prices and Incomes Board's current in- vestigation seemed primarily con- cerned with the claim that a rate of 4 per cent. for investors and 6% per cent. for borrowers did not leave enough for manaement costs, an increasing liability to taxation and adequate reserves. \"As a result of the financial crisis, however, a second issue has emerged,\" the statement asserted. \"This concerns the competitive forces which are attracting in- vestors' funds away from building societies. The figures for August already show the start of this trend which, if previous crises are any guide, is likely to worsen as the year progresses.\" The level of Interest rates in the economy was susceptible to change and could not be governed by a freeze. The Government. for in- stance, had made no attempt to influence local authorities' interest rates, and the Agricultural Mort- gage Corporation was now charg- ing 8 per cent to borrowers. \" When high interest rates are being used as an instrument of deflation, building society rates cannot re- main unaffected,\" declared the Association. A deliberate attempt to depress those rates would make home loans even more difficult to obtain than they were at present. In addition to disappointing prospective home- buyers, that could have a serious effect on builders. Inability to change house could also tend to immqbilise the labour force at a time when redeployment was necessary. The statement emphasised that the Association's participation in the National Plan was on the understanding that societies would retain their freedom to offer interest rates which would ensure the mortgage funds required. That freedom had not been abused by the societies fixing unreasonable rates. The ' -sociation was also ca- cerned whether, if the Government still aimed for 500.000 houses a year by 1970. it would have to be achieved by the public sector build- ing more than 50 per cent. That would be contrary to the National Housing Plan and to the Govern- ment's declared aim of extending home-ownership. The Hastings and Thanet Build- ing Society has decided to delay its mortgage increase to 7-/ per cent. from September 1 until January 1. an a a ebate will be granted to existing borrowetr for this period.",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN Some good two-year-olds will line up for the Imperial Stakes (3.0) at Kempton to-day, including Wolver Hollow, runner-up to Falcon in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot, and subsequently fourth to Mr. C. W. Engelhard's hitherto unbeaten colt for the National Stakes at Sandown; Turn Coat, a colt by High Treason, trained by P. J. Prendergast, who showed promise in his only race, at the Curragh, in May; and Fab, an un- raced filly by Acropolis, who is reported to have been moving well' at Newmarket. There are a number of other useful performers in the field, but I fancy that the winner will come from the above-mentioned trio and the one that I like best is Wolver Hollow. Assuming that reports about the abilities of Fab are not exaggerated, this filly, who represents N. Murless's stable in- stead of Speed of Sound, may be the principal danger to my selection. In the supporting events on to- day's Kempton card, Westerlands P.riestess, who was staying on strongly in a good-class sprint handicap at Newbury last week, can provide Mrs. Florence Nagle with her first winner since she was granted official recognition as a trainer, by winning the Duke of York Handicap (4,0); and Drevno, though no match for the Irish \" hot pot.\" Km, at Doncaster, Is likely to be too good for the con sistent Grande Marque in the Santol Stakes (4.30). The two principal events on the fourth and final day of the Ayr meeting are the Bogside Cup (2.55), a handicap for three-year- olds and upwards run over one mile and five furlongs, and the Tote Investors Trophy (3.35), a handicap for three-year-olds run over one mile. The first of these affords a good chance to Tampion, who has the beating of Blackjack judged on their running in a sponsored race here in July. And the second ought to be won by Track Spare, who, though he carries top weight of 9 st 5 lbs is of better class than his opponents. Regal Light, in receipt of 17 Ibs, could conceiv- ably cause an upset, but this hand- some colt does not appear to be in love with racing these days. In the absence of Pia, Grosvenor Square, a filly by Hush Lupus, trained by H. Wragg, might pro- vide the answer to the Firth of Clyde Stakes (4.35). At Haydock, Leadendale Lady with C. Williams claiming 5 Ibs, is a sound bet in the Hermitage Green Handicap (2.15); and My Old Dutch, though unlikely to reach the heights attained by his enthusiastic owner's Weepers Boy, has a reasonable chance in the Lyme Park Nursery Handicap At Thirk, the Hambleton Cup (3,45) appears to be virtually a match between Miss Dawn and Little Rapide, and though, judged on their respective weights for the Cesarewitch, Little Rapids has an apparent advantage to-day, I nevertheless prefer the chance of Miss Dwn,.",

Companies with extensive export turnovers provide particular attractions for the investor. They benefit from Government incentives in the forms of special credit facilities, tax reliefand marketing assistance; and global trading in a wide range of products makes them less vulnerable to the uncertainties of home markets. This Trust now provides a very attractive yield as well as the prospect of capital growth, but it should be regarded as a long term investment. Share prices (which in turn affect the price of the units themselves) can go down as well as up, but without these fluctuations there would be no opportunities for advantageous share buying by the Managers, or for capital appreciation.
