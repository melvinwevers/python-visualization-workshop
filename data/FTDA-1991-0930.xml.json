   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "Unilateral reductions could still be reversed, Cheney warns By George Graham in Washington, Leyla Boulton In Moscow, Ian Davidson in Paris and Christopher Parkae in Bonn THE US could still reverse some of its unilateral nuclear arms cuts if the Soviet Union does not respond positively, Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, warned yesterday. Mr Cheney and other admin- istration officials said they viewed the initial response of Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev as positive. \"We did not expect anything other than a general sort of endorsement which I think we got yesterday\", Mr Cheney said. Mr Gorbachev said on Satur- day he still had questions about the US initiative, but that he and President George Bush had agreed to set up a mechanism to discuss them. \"I think we are witnessing a major event which gives the world great hope\", said Mr Gorbachev. \"I think we will balance the account.\" Although Mr Brent Scow- croft, Mr Bush's national secu- rity adviser, said there were no conditions attached to the pres- ident's proposals to eliminate theatre nuclear weapons, put sea-based tactical nuclear weapons into store and reduce the alert status of strategic * Surprise over proposals' range; Questions remain over airborne tactical weapons, Page 2 * Hand of friendship for an old foe; Editorial Comment, Page 20 bombers and missiles, Mr Cheney said some of the mea- sures could be reversed. \"We can put the bomber force back on alert. We can redeploy our sea-based tactical nuclear systems,\" he warned. Mr Gorbachev had ques- tioned whether the US pro- posal to negotiate the elimina- tion of multiple warhead missiles included submarine- launched strategic nuclear mis- siles - in which the US has a significant advantage over the Soviet Union. However, Mr Cheney made clear he regarded these missiles as essential to the future US deterrent. \"We have consistently argued and continue to argue that those sea-based systems are different than land-based systems - that a land-based missile with multiple warheads on it is a very ripe target for the other side, and that there would be a temptation in a cri- sis to launch rather than lose that capability. Sea-based systems are radically differ- ent\", he said. Mr Cheney argued that the US proposals targeted the most destabilising elements of both sides' nuclear forces: weapons such as the Soviet SS-18 and the US MX Peacekeeper inter- continental ballistic missiles. Mr Gorbachev's response only thinly masked Moscow's eagerness to pursue arms reductions. Both his own spokesman, Mr Andrei Grachev, and Mr Boris Pankin, the foreign minister, said the Soviet Union would match the cuts with reciprocal conces- sions. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, uncondi- tionally endorsed the US initia- tive and called for matching concessions by Mr Gorbachev. Mr Bush's proposals include ending the development of a rail-based launch system for the Peacekeeper missile, but the Senate last week voted to Continued on Page 22 Gen Colin Powell (left) and defence secretary Dick Cheney: looking for reciprocal concessions US seeks positive response on N-arms continued from Page eliminate $225m (Â£129m) of funding for this deployment from the 1992 Pentagon budget US military officials see theatre nuclear weapons as having little purpose now the Soviet army is withdrawing from eastern Europe, cutting the risk of a surprise attack. The German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, described Mr Bush's initiative as \"a decision on an historic scale.\" The oppo sition SPD, while equally efu- sive, took the opportunity to apply pressure on France and Britain to align themselves with the US initiative. French president Mr Fran- gos Mitterrand, welcoming the USproposals announced that the leaders of the four powers with nuclear weapons in Europe - the US, France, Britain and the Soviet Union - would soon hold a summit. But his government made clear that it did not consider itself obliged to offer further reduc- tions in its nucleer arsenal. Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, reaffirmed that the government would continue with its Trident submarine- launched missile system. He said the Soviet Union remained \"a very dangerous and unsta- ble place and it still has huge stocks of weapons and huge stocks of nuclear weapons.\" The proposals were wel- comed by Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, who called last night for efforts to \"kick start\" the Soviet econ- omy. In a speech at Stanford Uni- versity in California, he said that Canada - as part of a co-ordinated effort by the Group of Seven industrialised countries - was prepared to provide preferential tariff treat- ment, as low as zero in some categories, to former eastern bloc nations. He urged a dou- bling in the capitalisation ofthe European Bank for Reconstruc- tion and Development to $25bn (Â£14.bn).",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens and Ivo Dawnay MR Neil Kinnock yesterday crushed an attempt by the left of the Labour party to halt his crackdown against Militant. However, he faces the prospect of an awkward defeat later this week by party activists over defence spending. The last Labour conference before the next general elec- tion opened in Brighton last night with a decisive vote by delegates to uphold the suspen- sion of two of its MPs from the party because of their links with the barred Militant ten- dency. Despite a series of rallies by left-wing sympathisers, Mr Terry Fields and Mr David Nel- list, the MPs for Coventry South East and Liverpool Broadgreen, found themselves barred from the Brighton con- ference centre. An emergency motion chal- lenging the decision last week of Labour's National Executive Committee was rejected by the conference by a 9 to 1 majority. The vote was cited by senior Labour spokesmen as further evidence of the iron grip that Mr Kinnock has Labour at Brighton: conference reports.....Page 10 Plan for private funding of Channel link............Page 10 established on the party in his drive to rid it of extremists. Mr Kinnock's authority was also demonstrated in a debate over defence in the 26-member NEC yesterday afternoon. He won strong majorities in the NEC for his view that two con- ference motions calling for Britain's defence spending to be cut to the average level of other European countries should be dropped. Mr Kinnock argued that such a commitment would limit a future Labour government's options in inter- national arms reductions nego- tiations. A statement issued by the NEC instead combined a wel- come for the unilateral reduc- tions announced last week by US president George Bush with a call for Britain to play an active role in negotiations to reduce and eventually elimi- nate nuclear weapons. That cautious position may well be overturned by the full conference in the debate on defence on Thursday. It is expected to back the call for a specific target for defence cuts and Mr Kinnock's aides were already preparing for that eventuality by stressing that such a vote would not be bind- ing. The opening of the confer- ence coincided with another series of opinion polls suggest- ing that support for Labour Continued on Page 22 Kinnock crackdown continued from. age and the Conservatives is run- ning neck-and-neck at about 40 per cent each. In spite of the ritual chal- lenges by Mr Kinnock for the prime minister, Mr John Major, to call a November elec- tion, the general view in Brighton was that next spring is now the earliest likely date. Against that background, Labour intends to use this week's conference to set out a specific programme for the first year of a Labour govern- ment, by clearly identifying its priorities. The programme will be the central theme of Mr Kinnock's keynote speech tomorrow. It is designed to emphasise that Labour has done more over the past few years than get rid of some electorally unpopular policies. Pledges to improve substan- tially the quality of education and training, to regenerate public services and to provide investment incentives for industry will be packaged as part of a strategy to take Britain up to the level of its European partners. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, signalled that the party would also continue to modernise its own procedures. Mr Smith predicted that the days of the trade union block vote, which currently domi- nates all decisions at the con- ference, are \"really coming to an end\". He forecast that over the next few years it would be replaced by a direct \"one-mem- ber-one vote\" system of deci- sion-making.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By John Willman THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to give the civil ser- vice unions notice of with- drawal from long term pay agreements covering 550,000 civil servants. The move comes as talks are about to start on changing the agreements in order to strengthen the link between pay and performance and to decentralise pay negotiations. The threat of withdrawal will put pressure on the unions to accept changes sought by the government. If the agree- ments, which set out the condi- tions for annual pay awards were scrapped, the unions would lose the clauses which link civil servants' pay to rises in the private sector. with the The Treasury is expected to make firm proposals to imple- ment the changes next month, aiming to complete negotia- tions by the end of the year. It must issue the termination threat today to give the required six months' notice for agreements which provide for a pay rise from 1 April 1992. The unions, which opposed the link of pay to performance when it was first introduced, are likely to oppose any fur- ther strengthening. The decision to renegotiate the six civil service pay deals was announced in July by Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancel- lor. It followed publication of the prime minister's citizen's charter which stressed the role of performance-related pay as an incentive for improving the quality of public services. The civil service agreements, signed in 1988 and 1989, include an element of performance- related pay which accounts for between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of the Â£7bn salary bill. Most civil servants cannot receive performance pay until they have been at the top of a salary scale for five years. Ministers want to increase the opportunity to win perfor- mance pay increments. Options under consideration include extending performance pay to staff not at the top of their pay scales, and awarding it to offices or teams which have achieved pre-set targets. Mr Lamont's statement endorsed bargaining at depart- mental and agency level, which appeared to end the Treasury's formerly implacable opposition to devolution of pay responsibilities. The government has been pressed for decentralised pay bargaining by the managers of executive agencies set up to deliver government services such as payment of benefits and employment services. They want freedom to opt out of the national pay agreements and to adopt pay and grading structures more appropriate to their operations. Some large government departments, such as the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, are seeking discre- tion to allocate pay to meet Coutinued on Page 22 Engineers' pay, Page 8 Pay threat Continued from Page 1 particular needs, while remain- ing within national agreements on pay and grading. The Inland Revenue Staff Federation has been involved in a long dispute over opera- tion of performance-related pay in tax offices, which has delayed settlement for this year's pay round. The Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA), which represents top civil ser- vants, has highlighted evi- dence which suggests that per- formance-related pay arrangements in the civil ser- vice discriminate against women. Treasury figures pub- lished by the FDA show that 52 per cent of top male civil ser- vants qualified for perfor- mance-related payments, com- pared with 38 per cent of top women. The government hopes that union leaders will agree to the changes in order to preserve agreements which have restored comparisons of mem- bers' pay with that of the pri- vate sector. The Council of Civil Service Unions will meet on October 8 to determine their joint response.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Business Failures Reach 930 a Week",
   "text_content" : "By Charles Batchelor AN AVERAGE of 930 businesses collapsed each week in England, Scotland and Wales during the first nine months of this year, according to Dun & Bradstreet, the busi- ness information group. That compares with 545 a week in the same period in 1990 and 900 a week during the first six months of 1991. Total business failures rose by 71 per cent to 33,532 in the first nine months of 1991, the largest increase for 11 years. The figures mirror the trends of the last recession, when business failures contin- ued to rise sharply for two years after the first signs of a recovery in 1981, Dun & Brad- street said. The group said it looked as if its earlier predic- tion of 40,000 business failures in 1991 would prove correct. The sharpest effects of the recession are no longer being felt in the south-east region and are at their fiercest in the south-west and the east Mid- lands, which recorded increases in failure rates of 90 per cent each. Wales, eastern England and Scotland also recorded increases of 80 per cent or more. In the south-west, business failures rose from 2,009 in the first nine months of 1990 to 3,830, while in the east Mid- lands they increased from 829 to 1,575. In the south-east fail- ures rose by 73 per cent to 6,705. In London failures rose 59 per cent to 5,654. The announcement coin- cided with the launch of a small-business Charter for Enterprise by the Federation of Small Businesses, which has changed its name from the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Busi- nesses. It said they needed a charter equivalent to the citi- zen's charters that have been announced by the main politi- cal parties. Mr John Harris, policy unit chairman, said: \"Small businesses desperately need a lot more carrot and a lot less stick.\" The federation's 28-point charter included calls for a mandatory analysis of all new regulations to assess their effects on small businesses; court reforms to ease the pur- suit of debts and the abolition of business rates. It wants the introduction of lower interest rates for business borrowing, a mandatory code of conduct for the banks and the simplifica- tion of business leases. Small business investors, Page 9",

   "text_content" : ".r PrOP k missiles, nd stored. from alert, r Start treaty 'd. Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the main points of President Bush's nuclear arms proposals PRESIDENT Bush's arms initiative raises crucial ques- tions about tactical nuclear missiles carried by aircraft that both the US and Britain plan to deploy in Europe, writes David White. The missiles would replace obsolescent bombs. US air- launched missiles would be the last surviving US tactical nuclear system once army shells and short-range missiles are scrapped and nuclear cruise missiles at sea are removed. Ground-launched nuclear missiles of intermedi- ate range have already been eliminated. Both the US and Britain are committed to keeping their programmes for a tactical air- to-surface missile (TASM). Mr Bush promised to \"preserve an effective air-delivered nuclear- capability in Europe\", saying it was essential to Nato security. However, the US has simul- taneously cancelled a nuclear version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack Missile, a derivate of which - known as SRAM-T - was its main candi- date for the TASM mission. It was also a leading contender for the UK's TASM. The decision, which followed technical setbacks, came amid growing doubts about the will- ingness of continental Euro- pean allies to accept TASM deployments. Both the US and the UK will now have to study alternative weapons. One UK option is an improved version of France's air-launched nuclear missile - Air-Sol Lon- gue Portde (ASLP) - but that would be more expensive than purchasing a US weapon. Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, made clear at the weekend that neither the aim of deploying a new missile nor Britain's Trident strategic deterrent programme would change, The only direct impact on British forces would be the long-awaited scrapping of Lance missiles and artillery shells, which are deployed with British and other Nato forces, and the UK's decision to follow the US by removing nuclear depth charges from ships. However, many analysts question the usefulness of con- tinuing with sub-strategic weapons as a deterrent against a conventional attack. The military argument for TASM is its flexibility. It is seen for instance as a means of deterring Third World coun- tries that might have devel- oped a crude nuclear weapon, without resorting to the threat of nuclear annihilation.",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-30",
   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent A SYMBOL of the Cold War was switched off at the week- end when Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, ordered 40 nuclear bombers to be taken off alert. This was the first step towards implementing the complex set of unilateral cuts, negotiating proposals and mea- sures to deactivate nuclear weapons announced by Presi- dent George Bush on Friday. Allies were informed in advance, but the scope of the proposals came as a surprise to most observers - the kind of surprise that a couple a years ago was being sprung more by Moscow than Washington. However, even after these proposals and reductions under the US-Soviet Start treaty - signed in July but yet to be ratified - both nations will have more than enough weap- ons to wipe each other out. Many - including long-range ballistic missiles hidden in the oceans on sub- marines, weapons in which the US, the UK and France hold a clear superiority over the Sovi- ets - remain unaffected. The proposals are therefore a far cry from the US-Soviet summit in Reykjavik five years ago when President Ronald Reagan came close to abandon- ing most and possibly all nuclear weapons, to the horror of European leaders who feared the removal of US pro- tection. However, they signal a sharp change in US thinking. After the Start treaty, hopes for a follow-up Start 2 with further bilateral cuts were muted. The Soviet military was not thought ready to accept further reductions and intrusion by treaty inspectors; it would he hard enough to implement and verify Start 1. The aftermath of the failed Soviet coup altered this out- look in three ways. First, it raised concern in both Wash- ington and Moscow about con- trol of Soviet nuclear weapons; even if the system of central control for releasing weapons was reliable, weapons could still be seized in breakaway republics. Second, the political upheaval presented the oppor- tunity for more radical disar- mament with financial savings for the Soviets. Third, confirmation of Moscow's effective retirement as a world superpower has speeded up a re-thinking of the whole role of nuclear weapons THE STRATMEC NUCLEAR BALANCE Warhad totol amd Min feP n au wider Sa traty US USSR Start Imhnt Intercontinental ballistic missiles 2,450 6.700' Submarine-launched ballistic missiles 5,400 3,600 Total ballistic missiles 7,850 10.300 4.900 Warheads on bombers 1,850 800 Total warheads 9,700 11.100 6,000 *Incudse SMO wreeds oan huvy SS-1S mnlul, due to be cut by S pr cont under Start. Beoed on Inerneotl Ional ontul Ir Strategic Studl figurw after the Cold War. The US and its allies built up a deterrence strategy both against the threat of nuclear attack and conventional attack. This evolved in the 1960s into a strategy of \"flexi- ble response\" based on a wide gamut of weapons, including US weapons of less-than-strate- gic range deployed in Europe. The idea was to make a nuclear response more \"credi- ble\" to the Soviets, and over- come doubts that the US would be prepared in the first instance to use its strategic weapons and expose its own territory to counter-attack. With the decline of Soviet strength, the break-up of the Warsaw Pact and Soviet troop withdrawals from eastern Europe, flexible response has already been largely disman- tled. Nato now has conven- tional superiority, and there- fore can rely less on resorting to nuclear means. The scrapping of short-range missiles and nuclear artillery shells was already inevitable. Nato agreed last year that the US should stop plans to replace them with new weapons. Battlefield nuclear weapons are seen as serving no purpose now that there is no close- quarter confrontation on the central front. The US has been reluctant, however, to try to negotiate a formal arms control treaty, as nuclear shells are small and hard to verify, and also because the Soviets would want to draw other categories of weapon into the talks. A decision to abandon these arms, in exchange for a similar Soviet commitment, was in any case expected to be endorsed by Nato leaders this autumn. The most significant US con- cession is the removal of nuclear cruise missiles, along with other tactical nuclear weapons, from ships and sub- marines. The US had already agreed on a ceiling for these missiles, although the ceiling allowed room for growth. The weapons are naval ver- sions of the Tomahawk cruise missiles, scrapped under the 1987 treaty on land-based Inter- mediate Nuclear Forces. The removal enables the US to maintain conventionally- armed cruise missiles at sea. These were used with spectac- ular success during the Gulf war and are another area of clear US technical superiority. The US approach bypasses Soviet demands for negotia- tions on arms control at sea, which Washington has stead- fastly resisted. Both the US and Britain pro- pose to remove anti-submarine nuclear depth bombs, which posed a severe contamination risk if ever used. In addition, improvements in non-nuclear weapons have rendered their value questionable. The proposal to negotiate the elimination of land-based stra- tegic missiles with multiple warheads is aimed at weapons such as the Soviet SS-18, the heaviest weapon in the super- power's arsenal, already due to be cut back sharply under the Start treaty. Based in silos, these are con- sidered the most \"destabilis- ing\" of strategic weapons. They would be at the top of the other side's list of targets. As one US official put it: \"One or two of our warheads can take out 10 of his.\" The temptation would therefore be to launch them as soon as possible. At the same time the US aims to halt the arms race in less vulnerable mobile missiles on land. It is scrapping its con- troversial plan to deploy up to 50 of its latest MX Peacekeeper missiles on railway tracks, and is asking the Soviet Union to abandon its counterpart, the SS-24.",

   "text_content" : "By Ian Davidson in Paris FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand has warmly wel- comed the latest US nuclear disarmament proposals, and has announced that the leaders of the four powers with nuclear weapons in Europe - US, France, Britain and the Soviet Union - will soon hold a summit. But the French government has made clear that it does not yet consider itself under an obligation to offer any new reduction in its nuclear arse- nal, whether unilateral or mul- tilateral, and that the only pur- pose of the four-power summit would be to discuss the control and security of nuclear weap- ons inside the disintegrating Soviet Union. When Mr Mitterrand first put forward his proposal for a four-power nuclear summit last month, it was greeted coolly by the US, and criticised by some in Germany. Mr Mitterrand greeted the plan put forward by US Presi- dent George Bush as \"a real turning point\". He said that France would be ready to join the nuclear disar- mament process the day that the two superpowers had sub- stantially reduced their arse- nals. In reality, Mr Mitterrand recently made a significant gesture in the direction of nuclear disarmament when he announced a sharp cut in the programme for the new-genera- tion Hades short-range nuclear missile.",

   "text_content" : "By David Goodhart recently in Maastricht THE Dutch government is determined to force a decision before the end of this year on the European Commission's directive on mandatory Euro- pean works councils for provid- ing information to employees. The UK government is alone in its fight against this. Mr Bert de Vries, the Dutch employment minister, told a conference on works councils in Maastricht, organised by the European TUC, that the direc- tive - which applies to larger companies operating in more than one EC country - would probably go before the Council of Ministers on December 3, just before the Maastricht sum- mit on political union. Mr Norman Willis, head of the British TUC and ETU presi- dent, also told the conference that, if the British government abused its veto on this \"vital aspect of social Europe\", it would increase pressure for more EC decisions to be sub- ject to majority voting. An extension of majority voting will be discussed at the Maa- stricht summit and is opposed by the British in several areas. Mr Willis also strongly con- demned a compromise proposal on the works councils directive floated at the conference by Mrs Martine Aubry, French labour minister. She proposed the directive be stripped down to rights to information and that the establishment of con- sultative councils be dropped. This, however, would proba- bly fail to satisfy the objections of the British government and UNICE, the European employ- ers body, which is this week expected to submit its own pro- posals for non-mandatory con- sultative procedures. The French compromise would also cause the German government to vote against the directive, according to Mr Horst Gunther, a state secre- tary in the Bonn Labour Minis- try, on the grounds that it would have been watered down too far. The final draft of the direc- tive, which was passed by the Commission earlier this month, includes a few minor changes which will make it even less palatable to the Brit- ish and employers. Previously, companies affected by the requirement to consult through works coun- cils were those with more than 1,000 employees operating in at least two EC countries and with at least 100 employees in one establishment in the \"for- eign\" country. In order to include service companies, like hotels, the requirement that the 100 employees be gathered in only one establishment has been dropped. The nature of the informa- tion that employers will have to provide has also been made more specific, in particular relating to mergers and clo- sures. Another late amend- ment hints that the 1,000-em- ployee threshold will be reduced when the procedure is reviewed after five years.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels EC foreign ministers will today try to break the gridlock into which the current Dutch presi- dency of the Community has driven negotiations on political union. Last week the Netherlands was attacked by seven of its partners for tabling new revi- sions to the Treaty of Rome which they believe reduce chances of agreement on a new union treaty at the Maastricht summit on December 9-10. The Twelve may also decide on whether to ask the Western European Union, the defence grouping to which nine of them belong, to send a force to Yugoslavia to reinforce EC ceasefire monitors there, now that hopes of a truce have risen. WEU defence ministers are due to hold a joint session with foreign ministers in the margins of today's meeting. At what may prove a water- shed two-day meeting in Brus- sels, the Twelve will also attempt to unblock negotia- tions with the seven-member European Free Trade Associa- tion (Efta) for a common free- trade zone from 1993 - blocked by rows over fisheries rights and heavy lorry traffic through the Alps - and with Czecho- slovakia, Hungary and Poland on transitional \"association agreements\" giving them greater access to the EC mar- ket and the prospect of even- tual membership. New EC trade concessions were blocked on September 6 by France's refusal to allow in small additional amounts of eastern meat. But overshadowing a crowded agenda will be the cri- sis in the political union nego- tiations. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, said yesterday he was \"prepared to make changes that everyone accepts in foreign policy and defence policy\". He acknowledged the new draft treaty was \"a little bit too much\" for the UK, but warned in a BBC interview that the Dutch presidency was \"not prepared...to go back to make a whole new treaty.\" Today the Dutch want dis- cussion on the substance of the five most contentious issues in the nine-month negotiations. These are: * Plans to expand EC involve- ment in a common foreign and security policy (CFSP). * Co-operation in internal security issues, from terrorism to immigration. * More powers for the largely advisory European Parliament. * The extent to which the EC north should finance the devel- opment of the laggard southern member states. * EC involvement in social policy. However, the Dutch will come under strong pressure to revert, at least in part, to the draft treaty tabled by Luxem- bourg, their predecessor in the presidency. Luxembourg had put the controversial CFSP and judicial co-operation into addi- tional and separate treaties to the Rome text, maintaining them as areas of inter-govern- mental co-operation between the Twelve. The Dutch have upset most of their partners by putting the two new policy areas into a single draft treaty, radically amplifying the powers of the Strasbourg parliament and fur- ther extending majority voting in the Twelve's Council of Min- isters. Among the most influential member states, Germany backs the Dutch draft and insists on greater powers for Strasbourg as its main condition for eco- nomic and monetary union (Emu). France would tolerate a strengthened parliament in return for German commit- ment to Emu. But it sees its hopes of a CFSP with teeth sufficient to evolve into a common defence policy sinking as a result of Dutch tactics. Spain is on this line but is also dismayed that the Dutch have kicked into touch its demand for more, money for the poorer member states. The UK sees a unitary treaty and real power for Strasbourg as a slippery slope towards fed- eralism. It is in the odd posi- tion of defending the Luxem- bourg draft, which is more digiste on social and indus- trial policy. Yet even if the Dutch back- track, many of their ideas, especially on the parliament, will stay on the agenda and keep the UK on the spot. For this reason, federalist Italy is opposed to Dutch tac- tics it feels make it impossible for the British Conservative government to sell political union to its party.",

   "text_content" : "MR Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, has played a key role in co-ordinating fed- eral military operations in Bos- nia Hercegovina and Croatia, Vreme, an independent Bel- grade weekly newspaper, reported yesterday, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The revelation came as six people were reported killed and more than 80 injured after weekend clashes. The Interna- tional Red Cross was forced to pull out of Croatia after one of its teams was shot at. Croatian radio said the Croat-controlled town of Nova Gradiska was hit by mortars shells and rockets yesterday while Bosnian radio reported that Croat forces fought with army units around the bar- racks in Bjelovar, northern Croatia. A transcript of a conversa- tion obtained by Vreme shows Mr Milosevic is working with Serb leaders in Bosnia, in a plan codenamed Ram, to carve out a Greater Serbia with the aid of the army. General Nikola Uzelac, com- mander of the Banja Luka Corps, yesterday ordered the general mobilisation of the entire fighting population in north-western Bosnia, despite warnings from the Bosnian government that mobilisation would ignite a civil war between the republic's Slav Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Yesterday's mobilisation fits in neatly with the transcript of the conversation between Mr Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs. Mr Milosevic guaranteed that Mr Karadzic could rely on Montenegro, a close ally of Serbia, for armed support. Mr Milosevic is quoted as saying: \"Get in touch with Uze- lac. He'll tell you everything, but if you have problems get in touch with me... Don't worry, you'll have everything, we are the strongest. While we have the army, they can do nothing to us.\" Mr Karadzic replied: \"That is fine... What about the bom- bardments?\" \"Today is not a good day for aviation, because there is a ses- sion of the European Commu- nity,\" said Mr Milosevic, who has repeatedly denied Serbia is involved in fighting in Croatia.",

Income would increase 11.2 per cent to Ptal2,600bn, leaving a budget deficit worth just 1.6 per cent of gross domes- tic product. That, however, is a considerable step back from this year's targeted deficit, which has been hit by massive public spending overruns. While Mr Solchaga has been able to trim back sharply on infrastructural spending next year, he has been forced to make steep increases in social security and health spending. With public sector borrowing having risen so sharply this year, the amount set aside to buy back government debt will also rise 26 per cent to nearly Pta2,000bn. Mr Solchaga agreed the budget might be mildly inflationary but his upbeat remarks about 1992 were interpreted by some analysts as a hint that Spain might be preparing to move to the nar- row band of the the ERM. The peseta, along with sterling, is currently allowed to fluctuate by 6 per cent against other ERM currencies. The Spanish, though, have always stipulated at least one condition for moving to the narrow band - the lift- ing of all capital and tariff barriers - and this has just been done. Although Mr Solchaga denied entry was immi- nent, it is thought Spain's decision to switch bands will be heavily influenced by political considerations, as was its original decision to enter the ERM in 1989. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish pre- mier, is keen to deepen and not widen the European Community, and it is thought he may feel a Spanish commit- ment to even tighter EC monetary dised- pline would help efforts to reach agree- ment on economic union at the EC summit in Maastricht in December. In addition, narrow band membership might strengthen the Spanish case for the establishment of a new EC compen- sation fund to channel Community funds south. Peseta membership of the narrow band - in which it could fluctuate by only 2.25 per cent - would involve a substantial and sustained lowering of Spain's high real interest rates, which currently make the peseta the strongest currency in the system. Such a cut is also what would be required to reignite the rapidly cooling Spanish economy.",

   "text_content" : "By Tim Coons in Dublin PUBLIC hearings in Ireland's Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry are due to start today, raising the possibility of further embarrassing revela- tions for the already hard- pressed government of Mr Charles Haughey. The tribunal is investigating allegations of fraud, malprac- tice and political favouritism in the beef processing industry. The allegations were originally made in the Irish parliament earlier this year and by a Brit- ish independent television pro- gramme broadcast last May. They focus on the activities of Goodman International, the privately-run beef processing group which is Europe's big- gest meat processor. Goodman has been accused of falsifying stamps, weights and classifica- tions, interfering with docu- mentation and abusing export credit Insurance. The com- pany, headed by Mr Larry Goodman, has denied the accu- sations. The inquiry is being chaired by Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, president of the high court, and was set up in June. The tribunal has received scores of written submissions from poli- ticians, government officials, veterinary inspectors and meat workers in the processing plants. The inquiry could prove damaging for Mr Haughey's government, if it turns out that Department of Agriculture offi- cials failed to take action when the complaints were made.",

   "text_content" : "Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing plays an accordion with protesters yesterday TENS OF thousands of French farmers invaded Paris yesterday in protest against falling prices and further steep price reductions scheduled in planned reforms of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy, lan Davidson writes. Unnerved by the farmers' growing anger, the government has multiplied assur- ances of moral and financial support. On sev- eral occasions, ministers, and even President Francois Mitterrand himself, have been harassed by local farm demonstrations. The farmers' protest march in the capital, which follows on a wave of more or less violent local demonstrations, some directed against trucks carrying imported meat, has been seized on by leaders of almost all the opposition par- ties. Former President Valdry Giscard d'Es- taing, leader of the centre-right UDF group, Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the right-wing Gaull- ist RPR party, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, and Mr Andrd Lajoinie of the Communist party, all took part In the march, from the Place de la Nation to the Place de la Bastille and back.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn THE rising tide of xenophobia in Germany yesterday cost the SPD its overall majority in the Bremen state parliament, and gave the extreme right-wing DVU an estimated six seats. The Christian Democratic Union, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party, made a strong showing, raising its share of the vote from 23 per cent four years ago to about 31.5 per cent. Although the result goes some way towards compensa- ting Mr Kohl for his party's severe losses in three state elections earlier this year, it still leaves the SPD as the larg- est party in Bremen. Its share of the vote fell from more than 50 per cent last time to around 40 per cent, giving it an estimated 41 seats in the 100-seat chamber, against 32 for the CDU (25). There was speculation last night that an SPD coalition with the Greens, holding steady with between 9 and 10 per cent of the vote, and retain- ing 10 seats, was possible. Until yesterday, the SPD had ruled the state alone for 20 years. The vote for the FDP, the CDU's coalition partner in the national government, was unchanged at around 10 per cent. Ms Ilse Janz, head of the local SPD, said she was \"deeply shaken\" by the result, and her CDU opponent Bernd Neu- mann said it was \"sensa- tional\", but all mainstream parties denounced the vote for the DVU. This extreme right- wing group first entered the Bremen parliament in 1987 with just one seat. During the campaign the CDU had taken the local ruling party to task for the over-lib- eral attitude of senior members of the SPD in Bonn towards the problems the country faces in dealing with the flood of people seeking refuge in Ger- many under the protection of its liberal asylum laws. Up to 250,000 people are expected to crowd into Ger- many this year, straining already stressed housing capacity. At cross-party talks on Friday, the SPD leadership scotched hopes of any changes to the constitution, which the CDU has proposed as the best way of dealing with the influx. There were more demonstra- tions in Germany at the week- end, and reports yesterday of further attacks on shelters for immigrants. * The interior minister of the eastern state of Saxony, Mr Rudolf Krause, resigned late yesterday. The state has been one of the hardest hit by recent attacks on foreigners and Mr Krause had been accused of not doing enough to stop them. He also faced claims that he once worked for the former East German secret police.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels THE government of Mr Wilfried Martens, Belgium's long-serving prime minister, yesterday survived a crisis pre- cipitated by tension between the country's French- and Flemish-speaking communi- ties. But it lost one of its five coalition partners. The moderate Flemish nationalist grouping, the Volk- sunie, withdrew from the coali- tion and its two ministers resigned after failing to agree on a compromise over arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Volksunie's withdrawal is likely to weaken the govern- ment ahead of the country's next general election, due in January. It leaves the Chris- tian Democrat and socialist parties - two from each lan- guage group - in power, but deprives the government of the two-thirds parliamentary majority necessary to push through Mr Martens' pro- gramme of constitutional reform and devolution to the regional authorities. The Volksunie and the Flem- ish Socialist party had wanted to block exports of arms to Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The move was based on pacifist principles but would have struck at the heart of the struggling Belgian arms industry, most of which is in French-speaking Wallonia. In return, Francophone min- isters had threatened to hold up telecommunications con- tracts which would have bene- sited mostly Flemish suppliers. --",

   "text_content" : "Haig Simonian reports on a compromise package TALY'S 1992 budget, due today, will indicate one of the most serious economic challenges in the country's post-war history. Last week's annual survey by the Organisation for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Devel- opment warned that a combi- nation of high inflation, high unemployment and a massive budget deficit was putting Italy increasingly out of line with its main competitors. Predictions of disaster for the Italian economy are regu- lar: both immediately after 1945 and during the inflation- ary, terrorism-ridden 1970s, recovery seemed virtually inconceivable. Now, the gov- ernment truly appears to have its back to the wall, as its room for manoeuvre is more circum- scribed. Italy needs large struc- tural economic reforms but lacks the political will. Financing Italy's vertiginous budget deficit is the crux of the debate - one which came close to bringing down the Christian Democrat-led coali- tion of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. The latest forecast is for a L145,000bn (Â£66.4bn) deficit this year, against a L132,000bn tar- get. The deficit now accounts for more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product. On paper, today's budget proposals should allow the government to claim that the primary defi- cit - the deficit net of interest payments - no longer exists, a substantial achievement. But that will only come about thanks to one of a regu- lar sequence of tax amnesties, this year promising to be big- ger than ever. The government is also relying on advance pay- ment of some property taxes due next year. These two mea- sures may help reduce this year's deficit, but it means the 1992 shortfall, deprived of expected tax receipts, will be a massive L190,000bn unless sim- ilar action is taken again. The EC has urged the gov- ernment to purge public spend- ing, crack down on tax eva- sion, reduce subsidies and embark on a substantial priva- tisation programme. However, elections due within eight months mean that none of these courses is likely to be pursued vigorously. Agreement among the four partners of the Christian Democrat-led coalition appeared to be a delicate bal- ance between modest curbs on public spending and new revenue raising measures, Robert Graham writes from Rome. The main aim has been to hold the public sec- tor deficit down to L127,000bn (Â£58bn) by find- ing L55,000bn. The compromise has avoided any serious attempt to introduce structural reforms to tackle Italy's huge public sector deficit. But this has been the price for maintaining the seventh government of Mr Giulio Andreotti and avoid early elections. The main cuts are expec- ted to come from pruning national health service expenditure and increased prescription charges. Mr Andreotti has been unwill- ing to force the controversial issue of raising the pension- able age. Public sector wages, which have been rising at double those of the private sector in the past two years, are expected to be held down to 4.5 per cent next year. Three main deficit-cutting measures are still pending: * Pension reform. Talks on cutting the spiralling cost of pensions have been mired in party-political bickering, although a compromise may now have been reached to raise the pensionable age to 62 for men and 60 for women (from 60 and 55 respectively). * Wage talks. Discussions between the government, unions and employers on reducing wage costs and reforming the scala mobile pay system, which partly links pay to inflation, have just restarted after the summer break, but the positions look as far apart as ever. * Privatisation. Only two big sell-offs are in the works. But much of the proceeds from both the sale of Crediop, the long-term credit institution, and the Istituto Mobiliare Itali- ano financial services group are likely to be used to shore up other state industries. Part of the receipts from selling IMI are already earmarked for recapitalising Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Treasury- owned bank. The need to cut the deficit has intensified now that the Italian economy is moving towards recession. But the gov- ernment's hands are tied because it must keep interest rates high in relation to its main rivals - Germany and France - to attract savers to invest in its bonds. Yet high interest rates have exacerbated the current downturn. Growth fell to 2 per cent last year, the lowest since 1983. In the first quarter of this year, the 0.7 per cent increase in GDP over the same period last year was the lowest in a decade. A string of poor interim com- pany results from the corpo- rate sector last week shows recession is beginning to bite. The car maker Fiat announced sharply lower profits and 50,000 temporary lay-offs. Total unemployment, which at just under 11 per cent is about twice the OECD average, looks set to climb. Inflation remains stubbornly lodged at 6 to 7 per cent - well ahead of the government's upwardly revised 5.8 per cent target for the end of this year and its 4.5 per cent goal for the end of 1992. Unit labour costs are increasing at about 11 per cent a year, raising industry's concern about declining com- petitiveness. Before the creation of the European Monetary System in 1979, the way to address declin- ing competitiveness would have been to let the lira slide. By regular devaluations, Italy kept pace with the rest of Europe, despite relatively high inflation and wage costs. But the EMS imposed new disci- plines. Since January 1987, the crucial lira-D-Mark exchange rate has been stable. A surprise upturn in growth may yet postpone the crunch. The OECD has forecast an opti- mistic 2.5 to 3 per cent growth rate next year, though many economists think Italy will do well to achieve 2 per cent. But only an adequate political response will help Italy over- come its profound structural economic imbalances. So far, there is little sign of it.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawith in Johannesburg SOUTH Africa today enters a new taxation era, with Value Added Tax (VAT) to be levied at 10 per cent, replacing Gen- eral Sales Tax (GST), which was levied at 13 per cent, as a consumption tax. The change comes amid countrywide protests against the tax and the prospect of sus- tained mass action from those opposed to its implementation. The government decided to replace GST because it was an inefficient source of revenue - easily avoided, and too full of loop-holes. Despite the intervention over the weekend of President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mand- ela, leader of the ANC, the gov- ernment and those opposing VAT have been unable to agree compromise terms for imple- menting the tax. The govern- ment, however, announced last-minute concessions by zero-rating various basic food- stuffs for a period of six months. The episode has cast a cloud over the political outlook, which had been hopeful only two weeks ago when the gov- ernment, ANC and Inkatha signed a ground-breaking peace accord. It is unlikely to derail the negotiation process, but it will clearly sour rela- tions between the government and the ANC until greater con- sensus is achieved about the terms of VAT's implementa- tion. The irony of the episode, with last-minute changes caus- ing widespread administrative chaos, is that nobody disputes VAT's merits. The argument is about the way in which it has been implemented. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC, conceded last week: \"The whole VAT matter is not about VAT any more but is about government trying to forcefully ram its will down the throat of the people.\" Although a whole range of organisations - small busi- ness, trade unions, medical, welfare, consumer, religious and political groups - have joined forces against the gov- ernment under the umbrella of the Co-ordinating Committee on VAT (CCVT), the muscle behind the opposition clearly Gunmen shot dead a prominent black civic leader and ANC member yesterday, shattering a relative lull in bloody violence since a peace pact was signed two weeks ago. Mr Sam Ntuli died in a hail of AK-47 fire in the township of Thokoza, east of Johannesburg, after gunmen drew up in a car and started shooting, police said. comes from the ANC-aligned trade union movement Cosatu and the ANC itself. Cosatu's leadership is planning a two-day general strike in November in protest against the move, as well as a boycott on all tax payments. Yesterday the ANC described the tax as \"a major part of the government's restructuring of the .economy. The intention is to entrench white privilegea nd the control big business has over economic life.\" It added that it would not accept that the government \"can dictate the economic restructuring of this country and their attitude leaves the ANC in doubt concerning their real commitment to the pro- cess of bona fide negotiations ahead of us.\" The point about these judg- ments is not so much whether they are correct - they do an injustice to the government, which has been consulting on the details of the tax for over a year - but what they tell about the ANC. First, the argument over VAT is clearly an attempt by the ANC to move forward the issue of an interim govern- ment; as far as the ANC is con- cerned, any new government initiative is liable to be vetoed by the ANC if it is not con- sulted beforehand. The peace accord is de facto recognition that the govern- ment is no longer running the security forces alone. The ANC wishes to extend this principle to the running of the economy. Whether the ANC/Cosatu is ready, willing or able to take joint responsibility for manag- ing the economy is a moot point. Mr Barend du Plessis, minister of finance, thinks not. He accused the CCVT last week of \"a disturbing lack of grasp of both domestic and international fiscal and sinan- cial matters\". Certainly, VAT's opponents seem not to have weighed the fiscal implications of diluting the tax base. Already govern- ment spending is seriously overstretched, with the deficit before borrowing and debt repayment in the first five months of fiscal 1992-2 equiva- lent to 85.6 per cent of the total projected deficit for the fiscal year as a whole. Second, the VAT debate has shown that the ANC is ill at ease with the institutions and practices of market economies. It regards big business with suspicion and fear; nor is it keen on the International Mon- etary Fund. That Mr Mandela has chosen three times within the last month to reiterate the ANC view that it would nationalise banks and mines if it came to power seems to confirm that the ANC is clinging to its old views of economics.

   "text_content" : "By Tony Walker in Cairo, Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem and Lamlr Andoni in Algters MR Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, has emerged from a session of the Palestin- ian \"parliament\" with his hand strengthened for delicate negotiations- aimed at ensuring Palestinian represen- tation in a proposed Middle East peace conference. The five-day session of the Palestine National Council, which concluded just before dgwn on Saturday, gave Mr Ara- fat a relatively flexible mandate to say \"yes\" to a summit without direct PLO involvement. However, significant obstacles remain to Palestinian repre- sentation. Israel, which signalled satisfaction with the Algiers declaration, insists it will not deal with what it calls the \"terrorist\" PLO. The PNC endorsed the PLO's right to nominate delegates to the peace summit from Palestinians inside and outside territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, including Arab East Jerusalem. Israel refuses to talk to Palestinians from the Arab sector, saying this would undenhine its claims to a united Jeru- salem as its eternal capital. In Algiers, Mr Arafat said the \"ball is now in the cither court\", a reference to the role of the US, the Soviet Union, the- United Nations, Israel and other partic- pants in the proposed summit. Asked if the PNC statement amounted to coniditional agreement to attend the peace conferene, Mr Arafat replied: \"We have the ri to put our view and requests.\" Arab states, including .Syria, Jordan,' Egypt and Lebanon, have agreed to attend the planned summit. Israel has': given conditional agreement to partici- pate, provided the issue of Palestinian representation is resolved to its satis- faction. Washington is prodding the Palestin- ians to form a joint delegation with Jordan as a way round an Israeli veto. The PNC declaration, agreed by an overwhelming majority of the about 300 delegates present, called for peace on the folidwing terms which PLO officials. insisted were flexible: * UN resolutions 242 and 338, calling for Israeli 'withdrawal from land occu- pied in the 1967 and 1973 wars, should be-implemented; * Jerualnim should be regarded as an 'ntegral part of the occupied territories; * Jewish settlements in the territories, including in Jerusalem, should be halted; * The PLO should be entrusted with the right to form the Palestinian delega- tion at any peace conference. In -New York, the US secretary of state, Mr James Baker, welcomed a Pal- estinian declaration backing a Middle East peace conference, but said he was still hot ready to issue invitations to the meeting.- Arab states, including Egypt and Jor- dan, welcomed the Palestinians' Algiers declaration. In Amman, Mr Taher al- Masri, Jordan's prime minister, said the PNC had \"dealt with events with real- ism and adopted resolutions that will help in implementing international legitimacy and easing the suffering of the Palestinian pople\". Mr Yitzhak mir, Israel's prime minister, avoided'official comment on. the iNC's conditional supiort for a 'eiiaei conference, while ckiowledging at xnferenc ewould probably take place. t Is ,een to underscore Jsrael's refuial to gript any'r*e in p sa tai k to the PLO, iwÃ½ch dominates the PNC. But he also.taitly \"acknowledged that the: PNC stance left open the way for Washington'to press ihead with 'its plans for a peace conference, At the sime time he expressed con- cern that recent US pressure on Israel. over loan guarantees to help fund Soviet Jewish immigration undermined the US role as impartial mediator. Three right-wing factions, whose seven seats give Mr Shamir's coalition its par- liamentary majority, went further, threatening to pull out of the govern- ment if the prime minister agreed to attend a peace conference.",

   "text_content" : "THE Algerian dinar was devalued by 22 per cent yesterday, part of the coun- try's continuing efforts to liberalise its tightly state-controlled economy, Fran- cis Ghiles writes from Algiers. The dinar had already lost over half of its value since the autumn of 1989. The Banque d'Algorie, the central bank, has so far succeeded in maintain- ing a tight monetary policy which has prevented inflation, officially estimated at an annual rate of 20 per cent, from getting out of control. However, the cost of the latest deval- uation will put further pressure on already hard-pressed businesses, which will see the cost of imports rising sharply. Pressure will also increase on the government, led since last June by Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozall, to devise an effective \"safety net\" policy aimed at preserving a minimum level of pur- chasing power for poorer Algerians. Although the International Monetary Fund, with which Algeria signed a sec- ond agreement last May, has said it wishes to see subsidies on staple food- stuffs cut further, it has also said devising a safety net was a vital pre- condition to such a policy. * The state of emergency imposed after the riots last June were lifted yesterday. Two days earlier the provi- sional leader of the Islamic Salvation Front (SIS), Mr Abdelkader Hachani, was arrested. He will join, in prison, the two main SIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadi, who have been awaiting trial, aloaLwith over 800 of their supporters, sined last June.",

But comparisons of unemployment rates can be very misleading, even when they are not being distorted by unscrupu- lous officials. A prime example is the apparent similarity in the pattern of unemployment among the young in the UK and France over the past decade. Youth unemployment, measured by the unemployment rate of males aged between 20 and 24, soared in both France and the UK in the early 1960s. It peaked in 1985 in both countries: at 20.7 per cent in France and 22.1 per cent in the UK. These unemployment rates are calculated by the OECD from labour force surveys and are relatively free from government tinkering. Comparing youth unemployment rates in the UK and France has been a popular pastime in Britain in recent months. Whether or not France has a worse record of youth unemployment than Britain is central to the debate over the Hkely impact of he Labour party's pledge to itrioduce a minimum wage. Oppo- nents argue that the French minimum wage has depressed youth employment. Supporters of the minimum wage have taken heart from the fact that youth unemployment has fallen sharply in both countries since 1965. True, it has fallen further in the UK than France. But 1966-1969 was a period of loose mone- tary policy and unsustainable growth in Britain. Meanwhile, France was suffering from slow growth as the economy adjusted to life in the European exchange rate mechanism. Yet the middle graph paints a very different story of the relative plight of young males in the two countries. The flip-ide of the fall in the rate of youth unemployment in Britain since 1965 has been a rise in youth employment as a percentage of the total population of males in that age group. ' In France, by contrast, the employment of young males has plummeted. By 1990 little over hal of the French male popula- tion aged 20-24 was in employment, down from 74 per cent at at the giming of the decade. Youth unemployment wad telling, but so was youth employment The reason for this apparent contradic- tion is that the youth activity rate - the percentage of the population that is in the labour force, whether employed or unemployed - has collapsed in France while it has remained roughly constant in Britain. In 1966 76.2 per cent of French males aged between 20 and 24 were in the labour force. By 1990 that proportion was more than 10 percentage points lower. Over a third of young French males were, therefore, \"non-employed\" - either unemployed or out of the labour force - compared to a quarter In Britain. What was the cause of this fall in labour market activity in France? There has not been a significant rush back to higher education by French males and the French youth activity rate is now much lower tha in n countries where the number of young people in higher educa- tion has traditionally been higher. It was 64 per cent in the US in 1990 and 60 per cent in Germany in 1987. The rise in youth inactivity in rance is instead part ofa more general rise in the number of *discouraged workersb\" In France people out of emnpoyment but who are no longer Veeking work. Dis- couraged workers are still *ble to regis- ter as unemployed and Ml benefits and are therefore dounti as unem- ployed by the goveinmenI But to be counted as unemployed by the OECD the individual must be both available for and actively seeking work. The \"discouraged worker\" effect can therefore be measured by the amount by which the registered unemployment rate for a country exceeds the OECDO's calcu- lated unemployment rate. In France, this discrepancy was equal to 2.7 per cent of registered unemployment in 1986. By 1990 it had risen to 11.3 per cent. One reason for the growth of youth \"non-employment\" in France has undoubtedly been the rise in the real value of the minimum wage. But this is only part of the story. For the level of vacancies has also been rising, as this week's table shows, despite the persis- tence of high unemployment The French unemployed do not, it seems, possess the skill that employers want.

   "text_content" : "By Alan Pike, Social Affairs Correspondent THE government came under pressure yesterday to strengthen its proposed strat- egy for improving national health standards announced by Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, in a green paper in June. A report by an influential group of public-health special- ists argues that Britain still has a poorer health record than many of its European neighbours, with wide divi- sions between rich and poor. The authors have written to Mr Waldegrave urging a tougher programme, with National Health Service funds earmarked for health promo- tion. They call for action in 11 priority areas, and warn that the government's narrower programme might serve to \"further inequalities between rich and poor, young and old\". A broadly based independent committee of academics and health specialists has produced the report, published by the King's Fund health policy research centre and supported by the Health Education Authority and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It says Britain has relatively low infant mortality rates, but expectation of life after the age of 45 is \"among the worst in north-western Europe\". Many of the causes of prema- ture mortality and other health threats are linked to social deprivation. Mr Waldegrave has decided against making the closing of the health gap between social groups a target of the government's strategy. The King's Fund report, however, emphasises the links between poor health and depri- vation. It says: \"The health dis- advantage of the working clas- ses might be an area of public health in which major gains can most readily be achieved.\" It urges action on smoking, diet, alcohol, physical activity, sexual health, road safety, maternity services, dental health, early cancer detection, high blood pressure, and immunisation. The government is under attack from health promotion interests for failing to support an EC plan to ban almost all cigarette advertising. Previ- ously unpublished health department research in the report shows a majority of Britons would support a ban on hoardings and posters and in newspapers and magazines. * Investment in properly equipped and staffed trauma centres would enhance the NHS accident and emergency service's ability to save the lives of accident victims, the Institute of Economic Affairs argues in a report published today.",

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith A NEW public register of parliamentary lobbyists is at the centre of a tightening of the rules about MPs' business interests recommended today by an all-party committee of MPs. The proposal comes in a report on parliamentary lobby- ing by the select committee on MPs' interests and follows an extended inquiry into the industry. Recommendations also include new restrictions on MPs' links with commercial lobbying organisations. Only commercial companies would be covered by the planned reg- ister, and it would omit chari- ties or pressure groups. The controls on MPs' inter- ests operate through a system of declaration. MPs are allowed professional and business links, but they must be pub- licly registered, and declared if an MP makes a speech in the Commons to which his or her interests are relevant. Separate registers of inter- ests also exist for journalists working at Westminster and for MPs' staff, but only MPs have access to these. Some among the parliamen- tary lobbying industry will welcome the prospect of a reg- ister, as they believe it will separate legitimate operations from more dubious practices. The recommendations will have to be approved by the Commons itself before they can be implemented.",

The walkers are pictured on Thurlstone Moor, South Yorkshire, an area of restricted access owned by Yorkshire Water By Andrew Baxter THE AVERAGE pay of engineers rose by 10 per cent in the year ended July, a slower rate than in the previ. ous two years but still comfort- ably ahead of the retail prices index and the average earnings index. According to a survey by Remuneration Economics, the Kingston-based consultancy, there has also been a further increase in the number of engi- neers who drive company cars. Of the 17,844 engineers included in the survey, 28.5 per cent have a company car, against 23.1 per cent last year and only 9.8 per cent in 1988. Results of the survey will provide new ammunition for bodies such as the Engineering Council, which have struggled to dispel the fears of potential recruits to the profession about its pay and status. In spite of a further fall in bonus payments in the indus- try, the earnings increase is the third-highest recorded in the series of annual surveys, of EMPLOYMENT which the 1991 survey is the 11th. The rise in 1989-90 was a record 14.5 per cent. Remuneration Economics sees that as \"an indication, perhaps, that the value of the professional engineer is being increasingly recognised by employers\". Even so, the average engi- neer covered by the survey is 40 years old, has been with his or her employer for 14 years and earns only Â£21,923. As would be expected in a recession, the number of staff, particularly those in junior positions, who have left their jobs in the last year has fallen from 6.8 per cent of the sample last year to 4.8 per cent - the lowest in the survey's history. Redundancy and retirement rates have more than doubled, to 1.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively in the past two years. The survey calculates increases in engineers' pay by using constant samples from one year to the next and com- paring all individuals at each level of responsibility last year with those currently doing the same job. 1991 Survey of Engineering Functions.

   "text_content" : "By Lisa Wood, Labour Staff A LARGE south of England training and enterprise council (Tec) and its local chambers of commerce are considering plans to pool their activities. The plan by the Tec, Thames Valley Enterprise, and three chambers of commerce, is part of the drive by the new employer-led bodies and organ- isations involved in aspects of their work, to find ways of co- operating more effectively. It is a move that government departments - including employment, which is respon- sible for training, and the trade and industry, which funds a number of activities in the enterprise field - are seeking to emulate. It is understood that talks between those two depart- ments on new strategic guid- ance to Tecs, which might result in them taking on some DTI responsibilities, are pro- ceeding more slowly than expected. Mr John Major, the prime minister, hinted in a speech in Wales recently that Tecs might be asked to take on more responsibilities. The chambers of commerce in the Thames Valley area - Thames and Chiltern, Central Berkshire and Newbury - are discussing how best they can integrate their activities with the Tec. The activities of Tecs and chambers of commerce overlap in some areas, includ- ing advising small businesses. That has given rise to jealou- sies in some areas. Mr Geoffrey Hyland, chief executive of Thames Valley Enterprise, said there was no definitive model for any new organisation, but he suggested an umbrella body to take on activities such as training in a strategic unit. He said he foresaw no in. perable difficulties with chamn- bers of commerce being funded privately and Tecs mainly by government. Mr Hyland added: \"I believe we should be building an inte- grated local service along the lines of the Continental cham- ber movement. How this is done in each area of the UK will vary, but we in the Thames Valley area are approaching all our local chambers of commerce to see how we can intergrate our activities.\" Chambers of commerce had reached a stage point where it was difficult for them to develop further without some sort of leap, he said.",

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporters UNCERTAINTY about the timing of the general election is disrupting business planning and may be delaying the rebound in investment and consumer confidence that many believe is essential to economic recovery. It is also causing headaches for local authorities, many of which are worried that an early election may upset plans to replace the poll tax and so disrupt council finances next year. One uniexpected effect in the City of the doubt over the date has been to buoy the market for some financial instruments that will be scrapped if Labour takes power. There is also evidence that companies have speeded up rights issues, or even merger activities, so that they are in hand before an election. Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of economic trends at the Confed- eration of British Industry, said the uncertainty about the election \"was not helpful\", and might be causing companies to delay investment plans. Mr Jim Maxmin, chief execu- tive at Laura Ashley, the fash- ion and furnishings group, said economic upturn was probably being delayed as consumers became \"ultra-cautious\" about increasing spending because of anxiety about the shape of the next government. At Bass, the leisure and brewing group, Ms Valerie Burton, chief economist, said: \"A lot of people would be glad if the politicians got on with it.\" Local authorities are also anxiously watching the elec- tion calendar. The govern- ment's new council tax is due to be launched in April 1993, a tight timetable that could be disrupted by an election much before July next year - the latest possible date for the poll. Should Labour win, it would almost certainly scrap the council tax scheme, which would greatly disrupt the coun- cils' financial planning.

The Jobclub, modelled on the British equivalent, will teach Hungarians how to look for jobs, make applications and improve their interview skills. Mr Mike Fogden, chief execu- tive of the Employment Ser- vice, an executive agency of the Department of Employ- ment, will formally open a Job- club in the city of Eger, north-east of Budapest. At any time, 50 people will be able to attend training ses- sions and use the centre's tele- phones, stationery and postage to help in their job hunt. Eger was chosen for the pilot by the Hungarian government as a town with a mixed econ- omy including substantial numbers working in mining and food processing. Unem- ployment was officially 200 last year, but is expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of 1991. British officials first visited Hungary in May 1990 with sup- port from the Foreign Office \"know-how\" fund, and have a strategy to help with market- ing, management and training over the next six months. The Jobclub has been operat- ing experimentally for several weeks. Indications are that people find it hard to under- stand why they should have to look for jobs for themselves rather than having the govern- ment find them positions. Nevertheless, Mr Fogden said: \"I am confident that Job- clubs can play a key role in helping the Hungarian Employment Service get to grips with the problems being faced there.\"",

   "text_content" : "INCREASED independence of company boards - and of out- side directors in particular - could strengthen them and raise shareholder confidence, according to Sir Adrian Cad- bury, chairman of Promotion of Non-Executive Directors (Pro Ned), Jacqueline Moore writes. Pro Ned has set the new tar- get of strengthening boards, now that the argument for the appointment of non-executive directors has been convinc- ingly won, Sir Adrian says in the organisation's ninth annual review, published yes- terday. About 96 per cent of the top 500 UK companies now have non-executive directors, com- pared with 50 per cent 10 years ago, according to Mr Colln St Johnston, managing director of Pro Ned. \"In the last 18 months, it has moved from 90 per cent to 96,\" he says, adding that, a year ago, 98 out of the top 100 companies had outside direc- tors, compared with 100 per cent now. The independence of outside directors could be improved by opening up the process of selection, Sir Adrian says. \"If there is even a hint of patron- age in the choice of outside directors, it will undermine their independence, the qual- ity which they above all should bring to the board.\" He also says there is a case for bringing on to the board directors with a different back- ground, who could challenge accepted executive thinking. \"People who have not served on the boards of other PLCs and who are older or younger than the favoured ages, women as well as men, may have a great deal to offer to the right board.\" Fund managers' exclusion may end THE EXCLUSION of fund man- agers in London and other financial centres from Swift - the Brussels-based co-opera- tive society that handles the bulk of international inter- bank money transfers - is unlikely to persist for much longer, according to Mr Bessel Kok, the organisation's chief executive. Speaking in Hong Kong at Swift's annual seminar on international banking, Mr Kok said he was confident that the long dispute over whether to give fund managers access to the system would be settled in their favour, even though a motion to that effect failed to attract the necessary 75 per cent support from Swift share- holders at their annual meet- ing in June. \"They [the banks] will come around eventually,\" he said. \"They just need a little more time and patience.\" R-R in talks over aero-engine deal ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero- engine maker, is in early nego- tiations to fit new engines to American Airlines' fleet of DC10 aircraft, the company confirmed yesterday. A contract worth up to $500m (E288m) could be signed next year for the RB211-535 engines. Rolls-Royce empha- sised that discussions were still \"very preliminary\".",

In an attempt to avoid charge-cap- ping, the city council is already cut- ting its education budget from 11m to Â£106m this year. But it has decided that more savings in 1992-93 are unavoidable. The education committee, which has agreed cuts of Â£3.5m for next year, will decide tomorrow how spending on youth and community work and the adult education service can be pruned. Their functions include enhancing standards of liter- acy and numeracy among the unem- ployed. The effects of the cuts include redundancies, a freeze on equipment spending and reductions in services. Mr Mark Corner, education com- mittee chairman, said the scale of the cuts showed the \"nonsense\" of the government's city challenge initia- tive, which will bring about Â£7.5m to Newcastle next year. He said: \"The government can afford money for prestige capital pro- jects but not for revenue spending. \"But the basic revenue spending is what is essential.

Around the corner in North- bourne Street, centre of an Â£8.9m North Housing Associa- tion revitalisation completed in 1989, empty flats are boarded up to deter vandals. As night falls, small boys across the road at the end of the street practise hitting stones with empty bottles. They are standing beside a council housing estate where workmen spent the afternoon erecting fancy porches, part of yet another attempt to trans- form Newcastle's West End by public-sector investment. Mr Arthur Keenan, 51, who lives in Northbourne Street, said: \"You think to yourself quite often, why bother?\" But Mr Keenan, who moved into the newly upgraded street in 1985 - when Prince Charles visited and the future, briefly, seemed rosy - is among a group of tenants who have decided they must act to pre- vent their area declining fur- ther. The city's West End, scene of rioting two weeks ago, has been the focus in recent years of a plethora of costly public- sector schemes. It is now among 11 areas chosen for the government's new city chal- lenge. That will pump about Â£37m into the West End over the next five years. Increasingly, though, the area's politicians, the private sector and those tenants who care about their environment are concluding that such investment can bear fruit only if local people, including the disaffected young, are involved in a way that gives them self-esteem, pride in their area, and hope. Mr Keenan, a labourer unemployed for the past 10 years, said: \"If you plough the money into decorat- ing just the outside, you can guarantee it will go back to the same state within five years. It's a waste of money till you fight the problems with the teenagers.\" Last week he and fellow resi- dents opened an office for the Northbourne Street Area Ten- ants Group. Its rebirth was spurred by a threat of rent rises to fund increased security in the wake of an Â£8,000 orgy of destruction by young vandals who wrecked an empty flat within hours. North Housing has provided a flat for the group's office and Â£1,500 funding - but local harassment has already dis- suaded some residents from involvement. Mr Danny Carrington, the group's 24-year-old chairman - an unemployed former barman and male stripper - blames parental irresponsibility in many cases. He believes more money needs to be spent in the area on recreational facilities to get young people off the streets. \"I think we could do with a million pounds or so here.\" The city challenge area con- sists of a three-mile strip run- ning parallel with the Tyne from the edge of the city cen- tre. It has 35,000 residents. Unemployment is about 23 per cent but in many pockets is much higher. Only 14 per cent of the 15,500 households are owner-occupied. The compre- hensive school serving the area has a truancy rate of 25 per cent and only 2.1 per cent of its pupils get five or more higher- grade GCSEs. Even before the riots, the West End's social and eco- nonmc mus aeterrea pnvate-sec- tor investment. Half the shop units in the privately owned Benwell Shopping Centre have never been let. Curbs on local-government spending have taken their toll, too. This year Newcastle City Council is having to make savings on revenue spending m tne city or Eiim ana is plan- ning cuts of Â£15m in 1992-93. Social security changes have also cut local people's dispos- able income. The city council, which bud- gets departmentally, is unable to give a total of public-sector money spent on projects in the West End in recent years. Ime scuemes, pas wiun pres- ent, applied to it since 1981 include the urban programme, estates action, the urban devel- opment grant, city grant, hous- ing action areas, general improvement areas, an enter- prise zone, a development cor- poration, a multi-agency crime prevention initiative, The New- castle Initiative (TNI) - the CBI's first business leadership project - a variety of environ- mental and economic develop- ment projects and, now, city challenge. Current and recently com- pleted public-sector housing revitalisation investment, vir tually all on homes less than 30 years old, exceeds Â£20m. Spending in the West End under the urban programme alone is Â£2.4m this year. In its city challenge submis sion, the city council said it hoped, under its five-year action programme aimed at creating 10,000 jobs, to spend Â£27.1m in the area in 1992-93, including Â£7.4m city challenge cash. One of the most promising schemes, the Cruddas Park ini tiative, suggests slow, pains taking work building residents' confidence, skills and aspira- tions matters at least as much as big capital spending. Started by The Newcastle initiative, the project has focused private-sector, educa- tional and public-sector atten- tion on a small, deprived area of the West End where 2,000 people live. After two years' intensive effort by all con- cerned, about 160 people have found jobs and several small businesses have been created by local people. The area largely escaped the riots. Mr Ian Sharp, a Barclays Bank manager seconded to TNI as assistant chief executive, doubts whether the private sec- tor has the resources to repeat such an initiative throughout the West End. Yet he has no doubt about its message: \"Spending money is important, but the most important thing is getting peo- ple to respect the property, be proud of it and make it an area where people want to live.\" Hoping: Newcastle West End residents Arthur Keenan (left) and Danny Carrington"

   "text_content" : "By Charles Batchelor PLANS. FOR a nationwide network of \"business marriage bureaux\" to forge links between private investors - \"business angels\" - and small businesses seeking equity capi- tal are expected to be announced by the government within the next few weeks. Pilot schemes will be run at five centres for a two-year period. The government will provide funding of Â£20,000 a year. The Department of Employment is assessing bids from enterprise agencies and other small-business support organisations to be allowed to run the pilot centres. Mr Eric Forth, small-busi- nesses minister at the depart- ment, has looked at the experi- ence of small companies with \"angels\" in the US, where they are estimated to provide more finance to small companies than the formal venture capital industry. One of the enterprise agen- cies to bid for a pilot franchise is the Staffordshire Develop- ment Association, part of the county council's economic development unit. The associa- tion would appoint a secondee from a bank or one of the large local employers to run the marriage bureau, said Mr Rob Redfern, principal finance offi- cer with the county council. News of the government plans coincides with the publi- cation of a report claiming that private investors are already an important source of funding to small companies but that, with encouragement, they could make an even greater contribution. Private funds are not fully exploited by small businesses and \"angels\" are unable to find enough investment opportuni- ties, according to the study by Mr Colin Mason of Southamp- ton University and Mr Richard Harrison of the University of Ulster. The researchers call for the creation of a national network of bureaux to bring investors and companies together.

   "text_content" : "* WOMEN: Delegates rejected an attempt to require constitu- encies formerly represented by a Labour MP to select by-elec- tion candidates from a \"women only\" shortlist. Ms Valerie Farnell, who refused to remit the proposal to the National Executive and insisted on a vote, argued that unless it was approved, the party's agreed objective of hav- ing women forming at least half the parliamentary Labour party by the end of the decade was unlikely to be attained. She deplored the fact that only two women MPs had been chosen as candidates to replace 18 men Labour MPs who would not contest the next election. * EAST EUROPE: Labour's National Executive committee urged Britain to initiate a new \"Marshall Plan\" to provide large-scale economic assistance for the eastern bloc. . It condemned the \"negative\" attitude of the G7 countries and called for a programme to help the long-term economic transformation of both the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern and central Europe. * TECHNOLOGY: A \"Great Exhibition\" of British scientific achievements would by organ- ised by a Labour government, Mr Gordon Brown, the party's trade and industry spokesman, will announce today. The aim would be to pro- mote British innovations in scientific and environmental fields. Mr Brown will call for measures to promote manufac- turing and to stop the \"brain drain\" among scientists. * CANDIDATE SELECTION: Mr Ashok Kumar, a research scientist with British Steel and a member of Middlesbrough Borough Council, was endorsed as candidate in the the marginal Langbaurgh con- stituency, where a by-election has been caused by the death of Tory MP Mr Richard Holt. * RULES INQUIRY: Ms Clare Short said last night the party leadership had ordered an inquiry into union attempts to oust her as candidate in her Birmingham Ladywood constit- uency. She said the electricians' union the EETPU had breached Labour party rules in increasing its membership in her constituency party, but she insisted there was no danger of her being deselected. * PARTY FINANCES: Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, returned to the issue of the Conservative party's finances, calling for an investi- gation into the Â£1.5m in dona- tions made by Polly Peck founder Mr Asil Nadir. * LONDON UNDERGROUND: Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said safety standards are being under- mined because some staff are having to work up to 24 hours a day to keep stations open. He blamed staff shortages and government underfunding.",

   "text_content" : "THE MASTER of ceremonies for Labour's week at Brighton - all but unknown to the wider public - is arguably, after Mr Neil Kinnock, the man who has done most to force through the party's quiet revo- lution. As party chairman, Mr Tom Sawyer will need to marshal his dry wit and northeastern charm to chivvy one of the world's most loquacious con- ferences through its daunt- Ingly ambitious agenda. Now in his late 40s, Mr Saw- yer has indeed plotted Labour's course back to electability with his reputation for integrity firmly intact From his place on the picket lines of the 1978-79 \"winter of discontent\" as a national official of the public employees union, Nupe, he has now ended up as chair- man of the powerful home pol- icy committee - the emngine room of the year polcy review. Like Mr Kinnock imself, Mr Sawyer mkes no apologies for his omurney rom the hard left to a more pragmatc interpreta thaB at dp'mtlor souihlb. \"All my life has been a learn- ing process,\" he said last week, \"and that is how it should be for political parties, too - to respond to a changing world.\" The young Tom Sawyer - his true first name is lost in the past - grew up in the aus- tere poverty of post-war Dar- lington, leaving school at 15 to migrate to the Midlands to look for work. After a shoploor apprenticeship with the engi- neering union, he Joined Nupe as a full-time officer, following his friend and the union's pres- eat general secretary, Mr Rod- ney Bickerstaffe down to Lon- don to become his deputy. By the time Nupe persuaded the other leading unions to back them for a seat on Labour's national executive, both men had moved firmly into the \"soft left\" camp. Rt was only after the party's 1987 election defeat that Mr Sawyer became fully converted to the need for a root-and- branch policy review. Today, he claims that Labour's late converion to the kindat of social democnc tics longa prevaling on the on tinent must be blamed on a lack of vision by the party's leaders during \"the grey years\" of Callaghanism. Once a political bag-carrier for Mr Tony Benn, Mr Sawyer now describes the hard left's prescriptions as \"a blind alley . . . little Englander fun- damentalism\", incapable of building mas appeal and out of touch with the rel world. For all his trade unionist roots, Mr Sawyer believes that Labour must push on with its own internal democratisation, eliminating the block vote at conference and exteating the principle of one member, one vote to its logical conclusons. Although publicly upbeat about the coming election, when pressed, Mr Sawyer will concede that Labour may still have more to learn. Yet it seems that nothing will siake his convicton that the potcal reeducation pro- cess the poicy review has undertaken has at least secured te party's future or the genaons to cme. Ivo Dawtay",

   "text_content" : "CONFERENCE yesterday voted by a margin of nearly two-to-one to accept important rule changes on the reselection of MPs aimed at minimising controversial contests and shifting from an electoral col- lege system to one-member-one-vote, Ivo Dawnay writes. Under the highly complex new rules, all members of a constituency Labour party (CLP) will first take part in a \"trigger ballot\" on whether a contest should be held, thereby eliminating the current obli- gation for a ballot once a parliament. If it is decided to press ahead with a reselection, a further vote will be held to decide whether to take the final decision on the basis of individual ballots or to allow for union involvement. The change is intended to rid the party of the current electoral college which gives the unions and affiliated societies up to 40 per cent of the votes. Should the CLP decide that the unions are to have a role, their votes will be counted on the basis of one vote for every three trades unionists registered with an affiliated branch. Opponents of the change say that this would allow unions to vote on behalf of members who have no connections with the party and may even support the ban- ned Militant tendency or the Tories. The soft-left lobby group, the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, has argued forcefully that reselections should be car- ried out only on the basis of one-member- one-vote. However, the Labour leadership under pressure from some unions, including the Transport and General Workers Union, has argued that its text is a reasonable compromise. Officials point out that the rule changes - still requiring final ratifi- cation next year - means reselection con- tests will be rare and almost always on the basis of one-member-one-vote. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said in a BBC interview yesterday that he believed the trade union block vote, which commands 87 per cent of the conference, should be eliminated. His remarks echoed similar sentiments voiced last weekend by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB gen- eral union, the party's second largest affili- ate. ,IK AsnMy AsnwooO Yawning gulf: suspended MP Terry Fields, speaking at a rally yesterday, failed to win the support of conference"

   "text_content" : "THE ANGER of those supporting Mr Dave Nellist and Mr Terry Fields was loud and heated yesterday. Unfortu- nately for the suspended MPs, that anger did not translate into numbers. At a meeting of Labour's national executive last week, Mr Fields and Mr Nellist were suspended from holding party office because of links with Militant. They were also barred from the conference hall. Action was taken against the MPs after the decision by Mili- tant to field its own candidate against the official Labour can- didate in the Liverpool Walton by-election in July. A rally yes- terday in their support at the \"traditional rallying point for the Labour movement in Brighton\" (The Level - a park that houses an enormous fun- fair at other times of the year) did not attract a very reassur- ing size of crowd. More a puny gathering than a mass demonstration, the sup- porters were mostly selling copies of Militant or Socialist Worker and almost made up for their lack of numbers with the size of their banners. Prominent were references to the socalled witch hunt of Militant supporters and the recent suspensions of council- lors. \"We're from Coventry not Salem\", \"Defend the Lambeth 15\", they screeched. Mr Nellist said: \"Our suspen- sion from holding party office together with banning us from party conference is a shameful capitulation to the incessant demands of Chris Patten and the Tory press. \"It's obvious that the odd let- ter from Tory Head Office car- ries more weight at Walworth Road than the hundreds of res- olutions passed in our support throughout the Labour move- ment nationally,\" he railed. His message to the Labour leadership was to adopt a dis- tinct socialist voice if it wanted to win the election. \"We need to try to persuade them to abandon this disastrous course,\" he said. Earlier Mr Fields and a clutch of expelled Liverpool councillors were discovering that life without the obligatory red conference pass was bound to prove quieter than the buzz of the conference floor. On the wide sea front, Mr Fields lobbied union delegates as they made their way into the Ship Hotel. \"The reception has been good,\" Mr Fields said. \"But general secretaries, the power- ful people, may be exerting influence and telling delegates not to rock the boat.\" Mr Fields did not want to rock the boat. \"It is a simple request we are making- just allow us into the conference.\" With him on the pavement was Ms Cathy Wilson, an expelled Liverpool councillor. This was to have been her 19th conference, but shifts in the party line had finally got the better of her. She exclaimed: \"I've been angry ever since I joined the Labour party. After being elected as a councillor in Liver- pool I voted against a rent increase and was expelled.\" As delegates queued to enter the Brighton Centre ready for the opening of the conference, Mr Nellist and Mr Fields handed out leaflets urging them to support emergency resolutions in their favour. Their followers, now dwindled to about 100, barracked the respectable face of Labour. Mr David Peel from the TGWU was unimpressed. \"The situation does not concern the poll tax, it concerns MPs stand- ing against people who have been nominated by the constit- uencies.\" Emma Tucker"

   "text_content" : "LABOUR is to extend its commitment to free-market economics significantly by drawing up plans for the pri- vate funding of the rail link to the Channel tunnel - a pro- posal the Conservatives have temporarily abandoned. Proposals by Mr John Pres- cott, shadow transport secre- tary, for changing Treasury rules to allow British Rail to borrow privately against its own assets have been agreed in principle with Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor of the exchequer. City consultants and poten- tial investors are advising the party on how a financial pack- age for the rail link might work. The move, which marks a further ideological shift by Labour away from strict reli- ance on the state sector for infrastructure investment, might encourage private-sector involvement with other gov- ernment-backed projects if Labour won the general elec- tion. The modified Treasury rules would mean that British Rail's borrowing from private sources for capital investment no longer counted among reve- nues when the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) was calculated. Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, will call for private-sector involvement in the rail link between Lon- don and the Channel tunnel entrance when he addresses Labour's conference on Wednesday. Among the schemes he is considering are: * Sale and leaseback arrange- ments with banks whereby, for example, rolling stock or land would be sold to banks and leased back. * Borrowing from banks using the assets along the line as security. Labour cites, as an example, schemes operated by SNCF, the French state-owned rail- way company, which raises most of its borrowings on international and domestic bond market. The party also believes the Dartford river crossing project has shown that the private sec- tor can be attracted by infra- structure projects. There, pri- vate contractors built the bridge and will collect tolls to repay its cost before returning the crossing to the state sector. Mr Prescott sees the plans as a way of getting around the tough strictures of Mr Smith against increased public spend- ing or borrowing under a Labour government. In an interview with the Financial Times last week, the shadow chancellor said he was \"sympathetic\" to proposals for allowing nationalised indus- tries to borrow privately. \"It is patently foolish that the Trea- sury in this country doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction between capital and revenue. I'd like to see that dis- tinction better recognised.\" The government will announce early next month its preferred route for the Channel tunnel rail link, but the ques- tion of funding the estimated Â£3bn cost remains unresolved. Last year Mr Cecil Parkin- son, then transport secretary, rejected a financial package drawn up by European Rail Link, a consortium comprising BR, Trafalgar House and BICC. At the time, ministers believed alternative private backers were unlikely to be found. British Rail's investment is at present financed from inter- nally generated revenues and strictly rationed government borrowings. The result has been cash starvation, with sev- eral big investment projects put on hold. Under Labour's proposals, assets along the Channel tun- nel route could be \"ring- fenced\" to form a separate company from BR. The party believes the flow of traffic through the tunnel will pro. vide near-guaranteed income. Ralph Atkins",

There may sun be some out- bursts hfrom leftwing delegates who believe that in trying to make- the party electable Mr Nel Kinnck has lopped off its radical roots. Nor is there much likelihood of the confer- ence's being mistaken for the Conservatives' annual gather- ing of deferential \"representa- tves\". But procedures introduced during the Kinnock era will ensure that noe of his senior colleagues will endure the humiliation experienced by Mr Denis Healey in 196. Then, Labour's embattled chancellor was treated little better than a rank-odfle del- egate when aroweut three milwnes to d wdt dt iel s that resulted in a t eram- tional Monetary Fund taking temporary charge of the Brit- ish economy. That does not happen in the new model Labour party. The policy review instituted by Mr Kinnock, which led to the dis- carding of the commitment to unilateral nuclear disarma- ment and a belated recognition that the market economy has virtues worthy at preeervation, also brought procedural inno- vations for the conference. The right to speak from the platform is no-longer an exclu- sive privilege bs members of the national executive. In con- trast to the restrictions imposed on Mr Healey, MPs and union oucials introducing policy statements are now given a dispe-sation to move up from the ranks of delegates who have to speak froma the floor. So fhr, the changes are tem- pary. Coaaereane iaelf would sat beatr eabet miis ters i a tture Labour govem ent enjoy an automatic right to speak from the platform.

   "text_content" : "THE VOTERS have not made up their minds. The raft of opinion polls accompanying the start of the Labour party conference in Brighton yester- day conveyed a simple mes- sage. The timing of the elec- tion is clear - 1991 is now the remotest of possibilities - but the outcome is hazy. When averaged out, the recent polls put Labour and the Tories neck and neck, with both struggling to command the support of 40 per cent of the electorate. The Liberal Democrats are hovering around 15 per cent. Behind public bravado, senior figures on all sides are happy to admit that there is everything to play for. For Mr Neil Kinnock, the best news is that he and his party survived the onslaught launched by the Conservatives during the past few weeks. Labour kept its nerve when it moved from 4 or 5 points ahead to same amount behind. Mr Kinnock is far less popu- lar with the voters than Mr John Major and his policy U-turns will remain a key tar- get for the Conservatives. Yet even in private his colleagues have largely resisted the temp- tation to suggest that they would be better without him. The surveys meanwhile show that Labour has greatly extended its lead since 1987 on the welfare issues of health, education, unemployment and pensions. No matter Mr Major's personal commitment to the NHS, Labour has suc- cessfully rammed home the message that the establish- ment of hospital trusts and family doctor budgets is the precursor to privatisation. Importantly for Mr Kinnock, as the welfare issues have moved towards the top of the voters agenda his party's tra- ditional weak spots - the trades unions and defence in particular - have slipped down the list of concerns. Meanwhile, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has done much to reduce, but not eliminate, the most important negative: the question mark over Labour's competence to run the economy. One recent poll even sug- gests a small majority believe that Labour would be more likely to deliver a better stan- dard of living. The same surveys that show more widespread acceptance of Labour as an alternative also reveal a marked lack of posi- tive enthusiasm. Labour is no longer dangerous but nor is it exciting. After three years in which its conferences have concen- trated on promising not to do things, this is the week when Labour will spell out what it will do. As Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, pointed out yesterday, the party will begin to campaign for its beliefs. At the conference we are promised Labour's manifesto for its first year or so in office. By Friday's pre-election rally, we are told, the country will have a good idea of prime min- ister Kinnock's first Queen's Speech. The priorities - in edt tion and training, health, ma - ufacturing investment and research and development - will be detailed in the context of making Britain the \"best in Europe\". However, as they look at the polls, Labour leaders are con- scious that this in itself will not be enough. They can make Labour a more attractive, less defensive alternative. But for Mr Kinnock to win Mr Major will have to trip on some of the rocks - Europe, the poll tax, unemployment - strewn in his path between now and next summer. Philip Stephens",

   "text_content" : "A RIGHT to independent career guidance will be the \"first call\" on the money raised by Labour's plans for a train- ing levy, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, will tell the conference today. Emphasis on skills will be at the heart of Mr Blair's speech, which will place Labour's industrial and training policies squarely in the context both of economic competence and of looking forward to the 1990s. He is expected to say Labour's aim is for everyone to be entitled to a personal devel- opment plan. At present, apart from guidance for young peo- ple, careers advice may be available from employers but is beyond the capacity of some small companies. The party will soon start negotiations with the Tecs, the career service and local author- ities about providing indepen- dent guidance. In its present form, Labour's training levy would be linked to the government's Investors In People initiative, with the additional criterion that employers spend at least 0.5 per cent of their payroll on training. People seen as likely to find independent career advice valuable include white-collar workers who have lost jobs in the recession, and those who recognise they need retraining. The overall message of Mr Blair's speech will be that the key test of a party's economic credibility is its ability to make the best use of the potential workforce. His attack on the government's record on unem- ployment is likely to focus on the issues of the long-term unemployed whose numbers are growing. He will also develop his recent theme of looking for- ward to a partnership in indus- trial relations for the 1990s as part of a broader cultural change, contrasting it with the Tory approach, portrayed as a return to the battles of the 1970s.

   "text_content" : "MR NEIL KINNOCK refused yesterday to give ground to left-wingers on Labour's cau- tious disarmament strategy, leaving the leadership braced for defeat in the defence debate on Thursday. His tough stand comes in spite of US President George Bush's proposals for deep cuts in the country's nuclear arse- nal and renewed pressure from the party's grassroots for Labour to reduce arms spend- ing to the average of other west European countries. But in a gesture to the dis- armers last night, Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, told a fringe meet- ing that the government should now announce that it would not increase the number of nuclear warheads it deploys. Under current planning, the UK's Trident nuclear subma- rine programme would increase Britain's nuclear capa- bility from 192 warheads to 512. Earlier, the National Execu- tive Committee (NEC) voted at its pre-conference meeting by 14 to 8 to call for the shelving of a motion insisting on the reduction of arms spending to average European levels. The decision came in spite of the high likelihood that conference will once again defy the leader- ship and insist on the cuts. Last year, six frontbench members on the NEC also rebelled against Mr Kinnock's stand. This time, however, there was no upset, with the shadow cabinet fully support- ing the leader, with a single abstention from Mr John Pres- cott, the transport spokesman. Delegates were predicting last night that the NEC will be defeated when the question is put to conference. Instead, there will be a demand for the UK's Â£23bn arms budget to be cut from 4 per cent of GDP to 3.2 per cent, an estimated Â£4bn reduction. There is also dissatisfaction on the left that an NEC policy statement on international affairs, drafted this week, fails to offer to halt the UK's Tri- dent nuclear weapons pro- gramme or reduce the coun- try's nuclear capacity.

   "text_content" : "THE GOVERNMENT has been accused of complacency over law and order in an attack by the chairman of the Bar, which represents barristers. At the Bar's annual confer- ence in London, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC told Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, that law and order were in cri- sis. He said: \"The police are desperately short of resources; sentencing policies do not seem to be working; having to use police cells to house prisoners is hopeless; the con- viction rate has never been lower; and yet there seems to be a general aura of compla- cency about it. What we need is some leadership to take us out of it.\" Earlier at the conference Labour's plans for a ministry of justice had been attacked by Mr Baker. He said the opposition's pro- posals were designed to secure influence over the judges and to make the courts \"directly accountable\" to MPs in every aspect of their organisation and operation. Mr Baker derided Mr Roy Hattersley's views on the judi- ciary to his audience of barris- ters and judges and said that the independence of the judi- ciary could be guaranteed only under a Conservative govern- ment. He said that the shadow home secretary was on record as saying judges were notori- ously their own creatures, disinclined through long exercise of power to heed out- side influence, and that at no time in our history had the public been less satisfied with them. The government's position was clear, he said. \"We respect and value judicial indepen- dence. That independence, free of interference from politi- cians, is one of the fundamen- tal principles rightly cherished in our country.\" The home secretary defended the government's record on law and order and law reform. It had pushed through substan- tial measures on police powers, criminal evidence, sentencing and prosecution arrangements. \"That is not a policy of neglect,\" he said. Mr Scrivener said that although the Bar's governing council had never formally debated the idea of a ministry of justice, no one within its \"cabinet\" was against it. He criticised the fact that the Lord Chancellor's Department was an extremely high-spending department which was only answerable to the House of Lords.

   "text_content" : "BARRISTERS and solicitors are still at odds over who should have the right to appear as an advocate in the higher courts, the Bar conference was told yesterday. Mr Philip Ely, president of the Law Society, which repre- sents solicitors, said the fact that the head of the solicitors' profession had been invited for the first time to speak at the Bar's conference was recogni- tion of improving relations between the two branches of the legal profession. Nevertheless, on certain issues, such as rights of audi- ence and circumstances in which a lawyer should be obliged to take on work, barris- ters and solicitors were still \"visibly unable to reach agree- ment or even common ground\". The government's reforms of the legal profession had delib- erately made barristers and Reports by Robert Rice solicitors into competitors but solicitors still needed barris- ters. Mr Ely also criticised the Bar for its failure to establish an objective scheme for identify- ing barristers with specialist expertise in particular areas of the law. The solicitors' profes- sion was establishing specialist panels for assessing solicitors' expertise in such areas as per- sonal injury and medical negli- gence because in certain areas mere qualification as a solici- tor was not enough. Without similar schemes for assessing the expertise of bar- risters, solicitors were unable to safeguard standards of ser- vice to the public in cases where it was necessary to instruct a barrister. It was not good enough to say that a spe- cialist childcare solicitor should just instruct any barris- ter, he said. On Sunday trading and the issue of whether the 1950 Shops Act contravenes Euro- pean Community law, Mr Jus- tice Hoffmann said the suprem- acy of EC law over UK law had never been in doubt since Par- liament passed the European Community Act in 1972. Generally, English law had adapted well to that but some areas remained contentious. The issue of the Shops Act had had to be referred twice to the European Court in three years, partly because the court had been unable to give a clear answer in 1988 and partly because it appeared to have changed its mind in two subse- quent Sunday trading cases involving France and Belgium. Sunday trading, Mr Justice Hoffmann said, was one area where the supremacy of EC law had produced a \"complete dog's breakfast\".",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard A PLAN by the government to introduce photographs on credit cards and cash machine cards is being resisted by the banks, which accuse it of try- ing to introduce a national identity card by the back door. The banks also say that forc- ing them to put their custom- ers' photographs on cards would have little or no effect in stamping out credit card fraud. They fear retailers would not pay much more attention to photographs than they do to signatures at present. Royal Bank of Scotland is, however, believed to be about to launch an experimental bank card with a photograph on it. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, and Mr John Patten, home office minister, have been pressing the banks over photographs on credit cards for several weeks through APACS, the inter-bank association for payment clearing systems. This follows a report on bank and cheque card fraud by Professor Michael Levi of Car- diff University earlier this year. He said that public opin- ion would not resist the idea of a photograph on a bank card. Prof Levi warned, however, that it might not bring direct net benefit to the financial institutions themselves. Banks regard this as an indication that the government's primary motive in making the propos- als, which would affect holders of more than 30m cards in the UK, is to ensure that most citi- zens carry some form of photo- graphic identification. The banks are to consider a common response early this week. In spite of their hostility, they are reluctant to confront the government directly. They believe that they could face a campaign against them compa- rable to the furore over banks and small business earlier this year, which some senior bank- ers privately regard as politi- cally inspired. A note setting out the banks' position on introducing photo- graphs on bank cards has so far run through more than 20 versions. The note would lay the ground for a meeting between the government and banks next month. Credit card fraud is rising sharply in the UK. Last year it cost about Â£130m. This year's losses will be about Â£160m, and the banks accept that losses could be more than Â£200m a year in a few years. Banks regard photographic identification as potentially less reliable than greater use of personal identification num- bers on cards or the introduc- tion of smart cards with elec- tronically encoded information on a microchip, which would identify card owners by verify- ing their signatures.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Peter Marsh THE GOVERNMENT'S Central Statistical Office is consider- ing dropping mortgage pay- ments in calculations of the retail prices index, as a pre- lude to bringing UK practice into conformity with those in other European countries. Any moves to change the RPI would be politically sensi- tive, inviting criticism that the government was attempting to put a favourable gloss on its economic record, so firm pro- posals for alterations are likely to be delayed until after the general election. Britain is one of the few Industrialised countries to use mortgage payments as a basis for measuring housing costs in indices of consumer prices. The CSO initiative arises partly from discussions about the convergence in pan- European inflation perfor- mance that would be needed before agreement on European economic and monetary union. Another aspect is that for some years the Treasury has been unhappy that Britain's system of measuring inflation fails to give a true picture of changes in prices at consumer level. Ministers are particularly concerned that if they raise interest rates in an effort to slow inflation, that will increase mortgage payments and have the perverse effect of pushing up the RPL Among alternatives to using mortgage rates for measuring housing costs, the CSO is con- sidering a direct monitoring of house prices or the substitu- tion of \"imputed rent\" levels - what householders would pay if they rented rather than buying. Another idea is to average mortgage payments over a long period. One difficulty for the CSO is that Britain has a higher pro- portion of owner-occupiers than most other developed countries. As a result, a sys- tem of measuring inflation that does not account for mort- gage payments would look dubious.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Christopher Lorenz on how teamwork has transformed product development at the pioneering US company digger which Deere & Co launched on the North American market a few months ago with the prosaic desig- nation of \"310D\" may look and sound mundane. But it represents a great leap forward for the company, not just competitively against Case, Caterpillar, Britain's JCB, and its other rivals, but in terms of its organisation. From a standing start three years ago this month the division which makes the digger has been trans- formed into one of the two or three units within Deere which have bro- ken down departmental walls most effectively. In particular, it has brought product and manufacturing engineering much closer together and has shifted rapidly from tenta- tive \"simultaneous engineering\" to what almost constitutes \"integrated engineering\". Until September 1988, Deere's industrial equipment division, which, as well as backhoes, makes log skidders, crawler tractors and other less exotically-named con- struction and forestry machinery, was one of the most traditionally organised parts of the group. Its structure was entirely centralised and functional. Then came recession, swingeing redundancies and a strike at the factory where backhoes are devel- oped and made in Dubuque, Iowa. Out of the crisis grew what man- agement and labour at Dubuque called the \"New Approach\", in which strategies and information really are shared between manage- ment and employees. Decisions are also decentralised as far as possible in a structure based largely on indi- vidual product lines, in place of the previous functional organisation. As part of an attempt to minimise the complexities of the previous organisational matrix, four-fifths of Dubuque's engineers have been shifted out of their functional departments into one of four almost self-contained businesses within the factory. As one of the four, the backhoe unit has been turned into a model of cross-functional collaboration under Roger Bridges, a fast-talking production man turned \"operations manager\" (in effect, product man- ager). Backhoe design, manufactur- ing engineering, production, pur- chasing and accounting executives all report to him. Only product planning and marketing do not have full responsibility to him, although product planning is located on the same site. Below Bridges, product and man- ufacturing engineering \"do every- thing together\", says Ted Breiden- bach, a product engineer by training, who as division engineer for backhoes took on responsibility for both types of specialist after the reorganisation. \"Before, we worked behind double glass doors a hun- dred yards apart and had to show our badges when we entered each others' territory.\" Now the two breeds share an open-plan office and the dividing line between their skills is growing fuzzy. This near-merger has been backed up by Dubuque's rapid increase in the use of multi-func- tional simultaneous engineering (SE) teams within the backhoe unit, comprising product and manufac luring engineering, plus specialists from welding, tooling, purchasing, quality and so on. The team mem bers remain constant throughout the development and initial manu facture of each product. The new approach has achieved striking results. * The 310D backhoe took only 18 months to develop, about half the time taken on a previous model. * The factory takes only 10 hours to make each machine, instead of five days (this saves $lm a year in inventory costs). * The 310D met its development and product cost targets. This is a big achievement. \"Almost every development project that we've had here has been over-budget, and the product has had to be cost-reduced after going into production\", says Breidenbach. * The product's cost is 3.5 per cent below the previous model, despite having a host of new features, including a much better cab and, for the first time, a one-piece \"main- frame\", the base of the vehicle; this change was decided upon for mar- keting reasons, but not until a year before the end of the development cycle last year. \"To develop that in one year, let alone at the original cost target, was almost unreal. It represented a massive change from our previous practice,\" says Brei- denbach. \"We couldn't have done this without our SE teams.\" Contrasting these teams - which reach down several levels in the organisation - with the previous higher-level product development project team approach which Dubu- que operated in the mid-1980s, Bridges says the latter was for the most part a mechanism for light- weight liaison across the old func- tional structure. \"The project team enabled us to start accelerating development by improving commu- nication and making sure the proj- ect stayed on schedule,\" he says. \"But it didn't do much for us in terms of the efficiency or quality of design, or the cost of those designs. Proper simultaneous engineering does this because of the full integra- tion of the various disciplines into the process from the beginning of the project and right into produc- tion. This integration just wasn't possible under the old functional structure because of conflicts in reporting responsibilities, and in the priorities of team members.\" Whereas some companies have limited their simultaneous engi- neering efforts just to product and manufacturing engineering, Bridges says: \"We also realised that you really have to go beyond those two functions to influence all parts of the process, such as purchasing and various factory operations. There are many other inputs to the suc- cess or failure of a new product programme than just how it is designed and how the manufactur- ing engineering is done.\" Unlike many companies, which have made design and product engi- neers the leaders of most of their SE teams - prolonging the divisive attitude that production people are \"second class citizens\" - Dubuque gave manufacturing engineers five out of the seven team leadership jobs within the backhoe project. To Bridges \"the background of the team leader isn't important - it's the type of person that is\". As for the thorny question of whether different types of special- ists in the new organisation really are prepared to share information with each other, Bridges underlines the importance of changes in the Deere-wide appraisal system, which no longer ranks people against each other but now rewards them for teamwork and performance against targets that include the service of internal \"customers\". According to Gary Tindall, who worked alongside Breidenbach on the 310D project, and has particular responsibility for new products, \"it's really personal relations that drive things here\". None of Bridges' people sees the current situation as perfect, however. Breidenbach says that, even after the changes of the last three years, there are still too many engineers of various types serving two masters: a functional boss at headquarters level at Dubu- que and, beneath it, Bridges or one of the other three business heads. Under pressure, Bridges says he may also be prepared at some stage to consider emulating the Harvester division by setting up more of a self-contained \"skunkworks\" organ- isation for new products. But, he says: \"We're pretty satisfied with our current set-up.\" Previous articles on rapid product development appeared on June 28 and August 21.

   "text_content" : "ell a bank, an airline, or an elec- tronics manufacturer that a green combine harvester and a yellow trench-digger herald their future, and you're likely to be laughed at or shown the door, writes Christopher Lorenz. Yet the streamlined ways in which Deere & Co, the American agricultural and construction equipment maker, devel- oped these two newly-launched products are very much leading edge examples of the kind of organisation which almost every company in every industry is strug- gling to create in order to survive against fast moving international competition: lean, flexible, and above all free of the departmental barriers between functional specialists which have condemned most large western companies to lumbering bureaucracy over the last 70 years. As Deere has found over its last seven years of learning how effective teams work, and as other companies are now discovering to their cost, the development of a flexible, team-based organisation is far harder and more protracted than most people realise. Along with a handful of other top American manufacturers, such as 3M and General Electric, Deere has long been admired as a model of good new manage- ment practice. This remains true today despite its business problems: in a gloomy market, its financial performance, although depressed, is much better than that of its farm machinery rivals. Back in 1984, the company's top man- agement conceded publicly that what it called a \"glitch\" in relations between its different engineering specialists was mak- ing new John Deere products far too slow and expensive to develop. As a result, head office set about encouraging Deere's various divisions, which have always had a great degree of autonomy, to experiment with different ways of knocking down the walls between different departments, and especially between its product engineers (designers) and manufacturing engineers. This glitch is especially costly, since it results in lengthy delays when manufacturing engi- neers are handed designs which they find (or claim) to be incapable of efficient man- ufacture without extensive rework. In some parts of the group, such as the components division in central Iowa, Deere started to use multifunctional proj- ect teams. In others, such as the Wiscon- sin-based consumer products unit (best known for garden mowers) and hay mak- ing equipment (in southern Iowa) the top product and manufacturing engineers' jobs were merged into one, and demarca- tion lines below this level began slowly to be fudged. In still others, such as the large and high profile Harvester division, where a functional merger was resisted, the com- pany experimented with bringing manu- facturing engineers in at the start of the development process to sit at the design- ers' elbow for three days a week, and to approve drawings before these were sent off to the production department. But none of these early solutions worked particularly well, even when, later in the 1980s they were combined with what has become known in western industry since 1985 as \"parallel\" or \"simultaneous\" engineering, in which dif- ferent specialists work on several phases of the design and development cycle in parallel, rather than in the traditional sequence. John Gault, Deere's corporate director of engineering services, com- plains of \"parallel tracks that hardly ever meet because of the lack of real Integra- tion and communication\". Under the pressures of a slump in US demand for agricultural equipment since 1985, plus unprecedented competition at home and abroad, \"much more far-reach- ing\" ways of overcoming departmental barriers are now being tried at Deere. Two of the most far reaching are now vying with each other for adoption else- where in the group as difierenit forms of what Gault calls \"really integrated engi- neering\". The two test beds are contrasting divi- sions: construction equipment at Dubu- que, eastern Iowa, which had no history of multi-functional teamwork until three years ago, but is now going great guns; and Harvester, near corporate headquar- ters in Moline, Illinois, which has been at it since 1984, much longer than most, but under a visionary engineering manager is still far from satisfied with its efforts. The lessons which Dubuque has learned from the development of one of its latest products, the $38,000 (Â£21,839) yellow dig- ger, are examined below. Harvester's experience, with plenty of trial and lots of error, culminating in last month's suc- cessful launch of an innovative new har- vester, will be discussed next Monday.",

   "text_content" : "GEC ALSTHOM has been awarded a contract by National Power to build a com- bined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station at Didcot with a total project cost in prospect of Â£450m. The go-ahead for it, however, is subject to receipt of consent following the public inquiry announced by Mr John Wake ham, Secretary of State for Energy. Included in the project and the total cost projected are the design, construction and com- missioning of two modules of 680MW each. It is planned that the first module would come into opera- tion in 1994 with an option to ibuild the second exercisable within 12 months. The station would be sup plied by natural gas. National Power already has a contract with British Gas for its supply. GEC Alsthom plant uses 9F Frame technology of the latest and largest design of gas tur- bines developed by General Electric of the US working in conjunction with the Anglo-French power group. Each module is to have two gas turbines, two associated heat recovery steam generators and one steam turbine giving a module output of 680MW with a thermal efficiency in excess of 54 per cent. In the meantime GEC Als- thom's transport division has secured an contract worth over $50m to refurbish the Hong Kong Mass Transit Corpora- tion's fleet of camshaft con- trolled trains. Under it existing mechanical camshaft controls will be replaced with electronic Gate Turn Off Thyristor (GTO) chopper controls. Technical equipment for Turkey INTERNATIONAL has been awarded a Â£67m contract for the management, supply, installation and commissioning of technical equipment to 28 universities in Turkey. The Nottingham-based com- pany is being backed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department. A loan is being provided by Chartered WestLB on behalf of a syndicate of banks including Midland, Standard Chartered and Guflf International Bank. The project is also receiving an Aid and Trade Provision grant of Â£23m.",

   "text_content" : "AMSTRAD, the computer group, is expected to report on Thursday full year pre-tax prof- its of Â£20m, less than half last year's Â£43.7m. Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman, said when he announced half-year profits of Â£40.1m that the company would do well to break even in the second six months. Since then Amstrad has announced that it will make an exceptional Â£20m write-down against unsold personal com- puter stocks. Some City analysts are wor- ried that provision is too small. They will be looking for an indication of the state of the curnent year's trading. Given the depressed state of the com- puter market, they are not expecting an early improve- ment. Forte will report on Thurs- day a sharp drop in pre-tax profits for the half-year to end July to about Â£45m from Â£113m a year earlier. Its hotel and air- line catering businesses were hit hard by the Gulf War and recovered only slowly since. Shorn of the Trusthouse part of its name, it continues apace with the \"branding\" of its hotels by market segment. Bank of Scotland's shares have outperformed the sector by more than 10 per cent since the May rights issue as the quality of its lending book and earnings continues to appeal to investors. Analysts are expect- ing it to report on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits of around Â£70m against Â£110m and a dividend increase of some 10 per cent. Sears, sporting a new chief executive in the form of Mr Liam Strong, ex-British Air- ways marketing director, will report tomorrow a drop in interim profits to around Â£12m excluding property and other income from Â£36.8m. How much of the costs of reorganis- ing its menswear operations it will take as an exceptional item is an unknown factor."

The policy making Fed- eral Open Market Committee meets tomorrow at a time when the White House is press- ing for lower interest rates and there is little sign of inflation- ary pressure in the economy. Although the Fed's discount rate was cut to its lowest level since 1973 earlier this month, Fed members are thought to be willing to ease monetary condi- tions further in the light of subdued money supply growth. However, it is unclear whether they will move immediately. Tomorrow's report from the National Association of Pur- chasing Managers should point to further growth in manufac- turing.

   "text_content" : "I ne 1945 atom bomb attack made the city a universal peace symbol. Now, it is intent on becoming a high technology centre, while local officials are determined to deal with current economic challenges, such as a chronic labour shortage, writes Robert Thomson -- ILÂ· 1-1 THE REMINDERS of Hiroshima's tragic past are on display for all to see. Monu- ments to the victims of the atomic bomb blast 46 years ago are scattered through Peace Memorial Park, and the city has self-consciously named streets, buildings and festivals to emphasise its role as a cen- tre for international peace. While the city, and the pre- fecture of the same name, will always be associated with that terrible event, they are also a symbol of the future challenges facing regional Japan. Resi- dents and officials have become a little uneasy with Hiroshima's role as a moss- gathering monument to peace, and sense that the region is falling under the long shadows cast by Osaka and Tokyo. Local businesses are preoc- cupied by the need to secure a labour force and are contem- plating investments in south- east Asia that would once have created new opportunities in Hiroshima. About a third of small retailers are unable to find a successor to lead their business into the next century, either because of the lack of an heir or a lack of interest among potential heirs. Even its carefully cultivated image as a city of peace is undergoing renovation. Over the years, the annual ceremo- nies and public statements have tended to separate the Hiroshima bombing from the Pacific war, while nationalistic groups have used the August anniversaries to further the myth that Japan was the \"vic- tim\" and not the aggressor. This year, for the first time, Mr Takashi Hiraoka, Hiro- shima's mayor, told the annual gathering that Japan's wartime brutality in Asia and the Pacific must not be forgotten. That message is certain to be refined in the next few years, as Hiroshima will host the Asian Games in 1994, and is conscious that Japan's neigh- bours are unwilling to share in celebrating the \"victim\" myth. Local people call Hiroshima the \"ABC City\". The \"A\" is for the atomic blast, \"B\" is for its status as a branch economy, as most government agencies and large companies have a branch in Hiroshima, and \"C\" is for the Hiroshima Carp, the loved but often beaten baseball team. There is general agreement that due attention has been paid to A, and the fortunes of C have improved this year, but local officials are determined to maintain the branch econ- omy status. They fear that the spreading influence of Osaka, to the east, and of Fukuoka, to the west, is lessening Hiro- shima's economic importance, and that some of those govern- ment or company branches could close their doors. The city had hoped to benefit from the redistribution of gov- ernment departments that was to accompany the decentralisa- tion of Tokyo, the capital. But the gains have come slowly. After a decade of debate, the central bureaucracy has seen fit only to grant Hiroshima a 37-person department research- ing the fermentation of sake, Japan's rice alcohol. Having won this small con- cession from the bureaucrats in Tokyo, Hiroshima officials recognise that they are respon- sible for renovating the econ- omy and retooling an indus- trial base that has been in relative decline against the rest of the country since the oil shock of the early 1970s. Hiro- shima has been dependent on steel production and shipbuild- ing, and the local economy continues to rely heavily on Mazda Motor, the car maker. Mazda's output amounts to 17 per cent of all production in the prefecture, and 25 per cent if suppliers are included. But there is concern that the flow of Mazda money to the local economy will be increasingly diverted to plants in other pre- fectures and countries, as the difficulty of finding labour and the rising cost of production in Japan are good reasons for building factories elsewhere. Currents in the flow of human resources are also a source of concern. A prefec- tural study found that 53 per cent of Hiroshima young peo- ple studying at universities outside the prefecture, whether it be in Tokyo or another city, do not return to Hiroshima. In response, the government has established an office to encour- age what is called the U-turn, the return of qualified young people to Hiroshima. Tokyo's bright lights con- tinue to lure young people from most other areas of Japan, though Hiroshima feels vulnerable because it has been slow to develop an information sector that would offer gradu- ates a greater variety of jobs and would contribute to revit- alising the area's image as a heavy industrial centre.

A new airport is due to open in December 1993, and if the pre- fecture gets its way, will have a runway of 3,000 metres, mak- ing it the equal fourth largest in the country and capable of handling a larger range of international flights. Tokyo officials would like to limit the runway to 2,500 metres. Congestion at Tokyo's inter- national airport and delays in the construction of a new air- port at Osaka have provided opportunities for regional areas to establish international air routes. A service between Seoul, the South Korean capi- tal, and Hiroshima was launched in July, and it is expected that there will be an expansion of routes to south- east Asia countries, which have struggled for new landing slots in Tokyo. Hosting the Asian Games will also broaden the area's ties with other Asian coun- tries. Hiroshima University is keen to attract students from other countries in the region. Having worked to become \"international\", Hiroshima is sensitive about foreign reac- tion to the spate of Japanese financial scandals. While the focus has generally been on Tokyo-based companies and the Tokyo stock exchange, there is disappointment that the stain has damaged the rep- utation of the country. Mr Toranosuke Takeshita, the governor, says the scandals have done \"terrible damage to our reputation\", and have pul- led domestic political debate away from proposed political reforms, which would lead to a literal redrawing of the politi- cal map by creating smaller, single-seat constituencies for the national parliament. He believes that restoring the reputation for fairness of Japan's financial industry should be a priority because trading partners may use the scandals as an excuse to block access to Hiroshima-made products: \"We have a lot of for- eign customers. About 22 per cent of our total production is exported.\" The scandals also heightened the sense of injustice among smaller Japanese companies, which presumednid that larger companies received more favourable financial treatment, but which have now had the hard evidence of this favouri- tism revealed at great length. It was a point of pride in Hiro- shima that Mazda Motor was not on the list of famous names compensated by leading brokerages for their trading losses. Small companies are all the more annoyed because of a per- ception that they bear an unfair financial burden arising from the excesses of larger companies, which used cheap- ly-raised funds to play the stock markets. The Bank of Japan pushed official discount rates higher to slow this specu- lation and to ease inflationary pressures arising from an over- heated economy. A result of higher interest rates and of banks' concerns about their capital adequacy levels has been that smaller companies are paying more for funds that are more difficult to obtain.

But he emphasises that the economy is \"generally strong\", in Hiroshima and nationally. Economic grQwth for this year is estimated at between 3.3 and 3.8 per cent, down from the 5.9 per cent of last year. As for the A of Hiroshima's ABC, the mayor, Mr Hiraoka, is hoping that his speech recog- nising Japanese aggression will be a step on the way to a broader consideration of the atomic bomb and to the word \"peace\", much used as it is in the region. \"We decided in 1949 to make Hiroshima an international peace city. Now, we are study- ing that role,\" Mr Hiraoka says. His comments on August 6, expressing regret for Japa- nese aggression, took courage, as extreme right-wing groups have reacted violently against officials denigrating the mili- tary's wartime role and, in par- ticular, highlighting the responsibility of Emperor Hirohito. Mayor Hiraoka's comments were an indication of Hiroshi- ma's development as a genu- inely international city, con- scious not only of injuries suffered, but also of injuries inflicted. It also reflected a more general willingness to transform a sometimes narrow view of the past into a broader vision of Hiroshima's role within Japan and in Asia.

   "text_content" : "Steven Butler sees a new airport take shape ON TOP of the rugged mountains 50 kilometres to the north-east of Hiroshima city, dozens of giant trucks and excavators are busy at work reshaping the earth. For the past two years, in a scene of Stalinesque proportions, they have been steadily chopping down the pine forests and bam- boo groves that once covered the hills, hacking off the tops of the mountains and filling in the valleys. In another year, the job of levelling will be done and con- crete will be poured in. By the end of 1993 Hiroshima's new airport will be open for busi- ness. It is an event that seems certain to transform Hiroshima because it will end the relative isolation of the region. Com- bined with extensive road building and completion of the city's mass transit line, a sig- nificant restraint to regional development will be lifted. Although it is a famous place - mainly for having been destroyed by an atomic bomb at the close of the Sec- ond World War - Hiroshima is hard to get to from outside Japan. It has an inadequate airport - a single landing strip, with no parallel taxiway, 1,800 metres long and 150 metres wide. It is barely large enough to handle the A-300s and Boeing 763s that land there now, and even this is impossible when the weather deteriorates. Only interna- tional flights from nearby des- tinations such as Seoul are possible. A traveller from the US must pass through highly congested Narita Airport, which serves Tokyo from a distance, and take the train to Hiroshima, or transfer to Haneda Airport for an internal flight. Osaka, how- ever, has no connecting flights, forcing passengers to complete their travels by a rail journey of several hours. The new airport will solve many, and perhaps all, of these problems. The go-ahead has been given for a 2,500 metre runway at the airport, and hopes are high that approval will be forthcoming from the Ministry of Transportation, which will own and operate the airport, to extend this to 3,000 metres. This would allow landings by long-range aircraft from the US, Europe or Singa- pore. Given local traffic demands and the congestion at Tokyo and Osaka In international traffic, Hiroshima could become an important regional hub. Strong interest has already been shown by interna- tional carriers. This would give Hiroshima the opportunity to expand on its already consider- able international business ties which have been built princi- pally through Mazda, with its link with Ford Motors, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The airport is being built at a total cost of Y72bn (about Â£310m), including an estimated Y5bn for land purchases. The land acquisition cost is amaz- ingly cheap for Japan, a result of having decided to build in an undeveloped mountain area, although airport officials admit there were a few \"prob- lems\" convincing some local residents to vacate the land. The airport has also not been without controversy. Aeroport de Paris lodged a complaint after its bid to design the ter- minal was rejected in favour of consortium that included Hir- ata Matsuda Design, Create Yamanote Design, and Austin Company, a US company. The French company complained that the procedure by which the winner was selected was unclear. It suspects a combina- tion of US political pressure, and favouritism toward the Japanese participants, swung the deal unfairly away from it. Bids for building the termi- nal, expected to cost between YlObn and Y12bn, will be due in March or April next year, and will be open to interna- tional companies. Eventually, there will be more construc- tion. Far more land was pro- cured at the site than will be used by the airport proper. A hotel and leisure complex will be built and, it goes without saying, a golf course. The new airport will be less than an hour from Hiroshima central by car, or by a combi- nation of train and shuttle bus. Although the downtown air- port is slated for closure, pres- sure is building up to keep it at least for shuttle flights to Tokyo. By the time the new airport is open, getting around the city itself should be a lot easier since the mass transit system currently under con- struction will be finished. Traffic on the streets of Hiro- shima is not too congested by Japanese standards for most of the day. The crunch comes during the morning and even- ing rush hour. Over the years as the city has grown, resi- dents have moved increasingly to suburban areas which tend to lie in valleys between the hills that surround the city. As a result, traffic is channelled into passes that create frightful bottlenecks during the rush hour. The answer has been to build an 18.4km elevated light railway system, above a newly constructed highway, from the city centre in a broad semi-cir- cle into one of the principal suburban areas. Plans for the line were extended to the ath- letic stadium for the Asian Games. Proposals are under consideration to complete the line into a circle, and to build other extensions and feeder routes. Downtown, parts of the line will be underground. The line is being built at a cost of Y130bn, two-thirds of which is supplied by the central govern- ment. Prising money out of the central government for pro- jects like this has become easier, says Mr Takeshi Kome- gami, a section chief in charge of urban transportation at the Hiroshima Prefecture construc- tion bureau, following the US- Japan structural impediments talks. Japan agreed at the talks to boost domestic demand by spending more money on pub- lic works projects. This has allowed money to be spent more quickly, and has sped up construction on certain parts of the line. It will not, however, result in an earlier completion of the line, as some parts of the construction timetable are not easily changed. When the line is completed, Hiroshima will have to decide what to do with its antiquated streetcar system. Hiroshima has become something of a depository for old streetcars when other cities in Japan, and overseas, pave over the tracks to make way for faster buses and cars. The streetcars are slow, and can create traffic jams at intersections. On the other hand, they are very cheap to operate and they are clean. And it would be difficult to justify building a more intensive mass transit system unless traffic volumes grow beyond all current expecta- tions.",

   "text_content" : "THE fifth generation of a theatre-owning family, Mr Noboru Tsuji colours his con- versation with appropriate theatric gestures. These emphasise his opposition to US-inispired changes in Japa- nese laws that will speed approval for the development of new shopping complexes. Mr Tsuji's Toyoza cinema is perched above a department store in downtown Hiroshima, but he fears that filmgoers, as well as shoppers, will be lured away tq planned shopping cen- tres on the fringe of the city. \"The small stores near these new centres will benefit, but the retailers here will suffer.\" The change in retail develop- ment laws was a result of the Structural Impediments Initia- tive (SII), the US-Japan talks designed to reduce Japan's bilateral trade surplus by removing \"structural\" obsta- cles to imports. Obstacles cited by US negotiators included a convoluted distribution system and the protection of small retailers against new, large stores which, the US presumed, would have more shelf space for foreign products. In the past, approval for new complexes has taken a decade or more, and many planned developments were scrapped after failing to reach a compro- mise with existing retailers. Small retailers are a formida- ble lobby group in Japan, and had warned the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that they would shift their support to opposition parties if reforms were introduced. After making clear that small retailers would be com- pensated, the parliament last May passed the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which forced local authorities to act on development plans within a year. Controversy has already n stirred by the plans of Toys R Us, the US toy store chain, open complexes in pro- vincial Japan. Hiroshima retailers are still waiting for a symbolic fight against a foreign retailer or an out-of-town Japanese company with ambitions to move in on their territory. The complexes already on the drawing board have been there for up to a decade, and are being devel- oped by local department store chains which are conscious of the need to keep small retailers happy. But Mr Tsuji and other small shopkeepers fear that a com- plex called Alpark on the out- skirts of the city could be the beginning of the end for down- town retailers. Alpark has two large retailers, Hiroden and Tenmaya, 180 speciality stores, and a few crowd-drawing gim- micks, including the clever Acqua Avenue, a cave-like aquarium that leads customers into the complex. Alpark was opened a year ago, but the spread of sales has not gone according to the two large stores' plans. Their sales were 10-15 per cent below expectations, while those of the small retailers, on average, were about 40 per cent more than expected. Mr Sugayuki Ishizaki, Hiro- den's head of planning, says his store's difficulties have been heightened by a 30 per cent increase in wages for part-time staff, a result of Japan's labour shortage, and by higher interest rates: \"When we started planning six years go, interest rates were at 3 per cent, and now they are 7 per cent.\" Tokyo has set aside Y162bn to \"encourage\" small retailers, who see the cash as compensa- tion for the new legislation. The money is intended to be used for the renovation of pavements, the improvement of shopping arcades, and to assist in the funding of events designed to attract attention to small retailers. A street festival organised by 20 small retailers not far from Alpark received Y500,000 in government assistance, with part coming from local authori- ties and part from the central government fund. The money went to hire an \"idol\", a reput- edly cute young pop singer, and a rock band with \"beauti- ful girls\", the publicity sheet boasted. According to a store owner in the area, the festival was a success, but the time taken up in paperwork for government financial assistance was cum- bersome. \"The spectators at the festival bought a lot of things. We had different kinds of people come, and it helped our reputation.\" But he remains unsatisfied, claiming that Alpark has resulted in a 20-30 per cent fall in sales among the group. \"I don't like the look of the future. In five years' time, the small retailers could be eaten by the big. We have an impor- tant role in people's daily life. We are convenient suppliers of daily items and we play an important role in keeping neighbourhoods safe by keep- ing an eye on who is passing by,\" he says. Another serious threat to small retailers is the shortage of successors to keep family businesses alive. Mr Minoru Tabata, managing director of the Hiroshima Small Shopkeep- ers' Association, says that a third of all small family busi- nesses could fold because the proprietors' children are not interested in carrying on the tradition. He says that potential suc- cessors are wary of dirty and difficult work, and would pre- ser an office job or, perhaps, to move to Osaka and Tokyo. The labour shortage has given young Japanese more job options, and there is no longer the same sense of obligation to continue the running of a fam- ily business. Mr Tsuji of the Toyoza cin- ema has that problem. He is likely to be the last of his line to run theatres. He has no male heirs, and he thinks that the business \"too difficult\" for his two daughters to run. His family originally operated kabuki theatres, and by the 1940s, controlled 15 cinemas. Now only one remains, and that is supported by the land rent paid by the department store downstairs. \"It's very sad to see old fam- ily businesses falling into dis- repair. Couples in their 70s and 80s don't have the energy to maintain their shops and they are not looking to the future, so they don't invest money in renovating rundown stores. They are just concerned about making enough to survive.\" Robert Thomson *mum rucuW n ins MIDKr snoouing coumpax",

   "text_content" : "MR Hiroshi Oyama is a politician who has a right to speak with self-confidence. Aged 72, he has been in politics for 50 years and has been head of the local prefectural organi- sation of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for 40. \"We worked very hard,\" is his understated response to why the LDP did so well in the last election. There was clearly more to it than that. In local elections in April the Hiroshima Prefecture LDP trounced the opposition as never before. Out of 69 seats in the prefectural assembly, Mr Oyama's party won 48. This was in part a clawback from the \"disappointing\" results four years previously, when the LDP was under a cloud because of popular opposition to the (then proposed and now enacted) consumption tax. At that time the LDP took only 40 seats in Hiroshima. Japanese politicians, it would appear, judge success by a dif- ferent standard from the rest. In the security of his position Mr Oyama is unexercised by some of the key political debates of the day. \"Every party understands that political reform is neces- sary,\" he says, referring to efforts by the LDP national leadership to reform the elec- tion system. \"The major issue is how to have politics without money.\" However, Mr Oyama says that sending gifts and tele- grams to constituents at impor- tant events is a long-ingrained habit that will not end just by instituting a small, single member district system for election to the national diet to replace Japan's single vote, multiple member district sys- tem. Mr Toshihiro Kanbara, sec- retary-general of the Hiro- shima Prefecture branch of the Japan Socialist Party, the main opposition party, gets rather more excited about the pros- pects for political reform. He says: \"They (the ruling party) were supposed to resolve the problem of politics and money, but they did not resolve it and instead are talking about polit- ical reform. \"We are concerned that the LDP is trying to use the issue of reform to monopolise the Japanese political system.\" Mr Kanbara and his col- leagues worry that under a sin- gle member district system, the JSP would lose many of the seats it now wins when its can- didates come in third, or even fourth, in elections for the national diet. They have enough trouble keeping the JSP's head above water as it is. Compared to the LDP's local comeback in prefectural elec- dions this year, the JSP's seat total declined from a paltry 10 to a mere eight. The JSP secretary-general blames the result in part on the ruling party's superior access to money. He says the prefectural branch has a spe cial role to play in Hiroshima as the party of peace. It is thus a local party with a foreign pol icy - to keep alive the mem- ory of the atom bomb and to oppose testing of nuclear weap ons. Mr Kanbara wants Hiro shima to be declared a nuclear- free zone. He is convinced that the people of the prefecture support this, even if they do not vote that way. Steven Butler",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "HIROSHIMA PREFECTURE, where the economy has for years been dominated by the shipbuilding and automobile industries, is making a success- ful bid to induce high-value added, high technology light industries. This change of gears is a product of necessity as much as anything else. Hiroshima lacks the expanses of flat land needed for the development of new large-scale metal bashing or assembly plants. And the population is concentrated to a point that highly-polluting chemical industries have nowhere to expand. Fresh water-supply for industry is also a potential problem. The transition has been a gradual one. Sharp, the Osaka- based company, was one of the first major electronics compa- nies to set up in the area in 1984 with its audio research headquarters. By 1988 electron- ics had become the fifth largest industry, displacing the chemi- cal industry, and falling into line after transportation machinery, steel, general machinery and food. The government has since acted to speed the transition. In the midst of farmland on the outskirts of East Hiroshima City a 20-hectare tract of land has been cleared and is ready for the builders. Though Hiro- shima's new science park is still empty, nearly all the plots of land have been taken. In a few years it will be a hive of activity. Not all the future occupants of the park fill the image of high technology companies. In 1994, for example, the National Tax Office Brewing Laboratory from the national government, which tests alcoholic bever- ages, will move from several locations scattered around Tokyo to a single site at the Hiroshima park. The move is part of a drive to reduce the concentration of government services in Tokyo. And locat- ing in Hiroshima makes sense because of a large and famous local sake industry. The big \"catch\" for the sci- ence park is Matsushita Elec- tric. Matsushita, the largest consumer electronics company in the world, will set up a research facility, to be opened in 1996, to conduct research into the use of computers in home appliances. Other occu- pants for the park will include the Technology Research Insti- tute for Chugoku Electric Power, the regional electricity utility, and a joint public-pri- vate venture called Techno Plaza, aimed at providing space for small and medium- sized high tech companies. Outside the park, Dai Nippon Printing, Japan's largest print- ing company, last year decided to build a plant in Hiroshima to produce large-scale televi- sion projection display screens. In 1990 NEC, the world's larg- est semiconductor manufac- turer, established a facility for large-scale integrated circuits. It would be wrong to suggest that Hiroshima is about to take the lead in the Japanese elec- tronics industry or that this has become a dominant force in the economy. In the last five years, 20 electronics and preci- sion machinery companies have set up shop, compared with 70 metallurgical compa- nies and 69 general machinery companies. However, a suc- cessful new industry has taken root in Hiroshima and local officials are doing their best to promote the area's strengths. These, they argue, include relatively cheap land, an improving transportation sys- tem, and proximity to a quality university. The campus of Hiroshima University is mov- ing gradually to a greenfield site out of the city centre in East Hiroshima, not far from the science park. The natural environment and recreational spaces of Hiroshima are vastly superior to Tokyo. Persuading more young people of the virtues of living in a provincial city is an important key to solving a problem that is as severe in Hiroshima as anywhere else in Japan: the shortage of labour.

   "text_content" : "MR Nubuo Nagao, a rice and mushroom farmer who lives to the west of Hiroshima city, gets almoist a third of his income from a local govern- ment job. But what is unusual is how much, rather than how little, Mr Nagao is dependent on his land. More than other Japanese farming district, Hiroshima prefecture, which also takes in the surrounding countryside, has seen a steady reduction in agriculture as a proportion of rural incomes. Only 6,000 of the 100,000 farmers there depend on agri- culture alone, while, on aver- age, only 7 per cent of farmers' incomes derive from farming. This compares with the national average of 18 per cent and is the lowest proportion of any prefecture in Japan. But despite this, the numer- ous challenges which are con- fronting Japanese agriculture, from the demographics of an ageing population to market liberalisation, are of real con- cern to the people and govern- ment of the prefecture. Almost one-seventh of its population lives in rural areas, while agricultural income amounts to about Yl40bn ($1bn) per year. \"When we compare our- selves with other prefectures the situation is not so diffi- cult,\" says Mr Michihiro Nakai, director of agricultural policy research in the prefectural gov- ernment. \"But there is still an important need for restructur- ing and it is an emotive issue.\" The most sensitive aspect of restructuring is the opening of Japan's inefficient and highly protected agricultural markets to foreign products. In particu- lar, the government in Tokyo appears to be on the verge of allowing imports of rice, by far the most controversial element of agricultural liberalisation. Resistance to the move has been strong. Farmers and local politicians regard the rumoured 5 per cent opening of the market as the beginning of a slippery slope which will lead to substantial market access for foreigners. In defence of their case, they present an array of arguments ranging from food security to the importance of rice farming in Japanese traditional culture. But for many farmers there is a sense that market opening is inevitable. \"My heart is against liberalisation,\" says Mr Nagao. \"But when you look at the world and you look at the Japanese situation, I believe that we cannot avoid it.\" The task now, both for farm- ers and local government offi- cials, is to prepare for a more competitive environment. This means diversifying into new products and increasing the efficiency of local production. Rice is still the dominant agricultural product in the pre- fecture: 32,000 of the area's 70,000 hectares of farming land are paddy fields. Income from rice amounts to Y52bn, com- pared with Y14bn for fruit and Y18bn for vegetables. To reduce the dominance of rice production and to encour- age agricultural diversifica- lion, the government is urging farmers to convert one-third of their paddy fields to new prod- ucts. Since 1978, according to the farmers' union in Hiro- shima, about 14,000 hectares of paddy fields have been con- verted. Mr Nakai, at the prefec- tural office, reports that grapes and orchids, to aubergines and grapefruit, are now being grown in Hiroshima. But the task is not easy. Changing the ways of farmers is difficult in any country and is further complicated by social patterns in Japanese agricul- ture. Rice-farming is regarded as important in maintaining Shuraku - groups of house- holds which form farming co- operatives particularly in the remote areas of the prefecture. Moreover, farmers' represen- tatives argue that there are limits to the amount of land which can be converted. \"It is not so easy to change rice- farming land to other uses,\" says Mr Furukawa of the Cen- tral Hiroshima's Farmers' Union. He adds that the com- pensation offered by the gov- ernment - between Y15,000 and Y25,000 for every 100 square metres converted - is inadequate. The government is also try- ing to increase the efficiency of existing production. Low inter- est loans are available to buy land and farm machinery. Cur- rently, the average farm size in Hiroshima is a mere 0.73 hect- ares - a fiftieth of the size of the average British farm and little more than the size of a backyard in US and Australian counterparts. Again rural government offi- cials report progress. But the price of real estate and the reluctance of members of the rural community to part with land which has often been passed down through several generations is limiting the suc- cess of the policy. The underlying problem is the teaching of new tricks to old farmers. Young Japanese continue to leave the country- side for more attractive jobs in the city. Mr Nagao's son - a typical example - works for a company in Hiroshima and puts in only two or three days' work on the farm every year. So, just as international pressures for the opening of Japan's agricultural markets create an imperative for reform, in Hiroshima, as in the rest of Japan, the changes which have already occurred are making the necessary restructuring hard to achieve.

   "text_content" : "John Ridding profiles the city's bi get empoyer L LI WHEN A Mazda car pulled past its Mercedes and Jaguar rivals to take the chequered flag in the 24-hour Le Mans race earlier this year, there were loud cheers from the peo- ple of Hiroshima. The company, the country's fourth largest automobile man- ufacturer, is by some distance the city's largest employer. Its victory - the first by a Japa- nese car maker - prompted celebrations well beyond its giant dockside headquarters. The celebrations bear testa- ment to Mazda's close relation- ship with the city. The com- pany represents about 17 per cent of industrial production in Hiroshima prefecture, and 25 per cent if group suppliers are included. The success of Hiro- shima and its environs are thus bound up with the suc- cess of its car company. Off the race track, the going is not so easy. Like all Japa- nese automobile manufactur- ers, Mazda is currently facing a slowdown in sales and a fall in -profits after four consecutive years of impressive progress. The downturn is the result of recession in overseas mar- kets and a cooling of the Japa- nese consumer boom. But Mazda is coping better than most of its Japanese, and virtu- ally all of its international, competitors in responding to the more difficult environment. Its business strategy should position it well for the next stage of expansion. Part of the company's strat- egy is to move its products upmarket. With its new mod- els, as at Le Mans, Mazda has been closing the gap on the top European and US producers. Although its cars are not yet the equal of top-of-the-range Mercedes and BMWs they are looming ever larger in rivals' rear view mirrors. The policy of moving upmarket, manifest in the styl- ish new Sentia model, has been prompted by several factors. On the one hand, the company is aiming to accommodate Mazda owners as they gradu- ate from its entry-level and low cost models. At the same time, cost pressures and competition from cheaper producers over- seas has encouraged a move to higher value-added vehicles and raised profit margins. But the introduction of more luxurious vehicles, which will be taken a step further with the unveiling of new vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show next month, is only one part of a three-pronged strategy. The company is also seeking to exploit niche markets. \"We are a medium-sized company and that brings us advantages which are not available to giants like GM or Toyota,\" says one executive. \"In particu- lar, it allows us to be flexible and to exploit various niches in the industry.\" One of the most successful cases has been the Miata, a two-seater convertible sports car which was introduced at the end of last year. The MPV, something between a jeep and a van, has also been a success. The development of such vehicles has been made possi- ble by a change in the way Mazda makes decisions on new products. In 197 the power to decide which cars to launch was shifted from the relatively conservative marketing depart- ment to the company's product planning department. In essence this involved a shift in philosophy from introd- ucing vehicles which satisfied existing consumer demands to those which shaped and cre- ated new tastes. \"The change A shift from vehicles which satisfy existing consumer demands to those which shae and create new tastes is what lies behind the Miata and the MPV,\" says one com- pany official. \"Without it they probably wouldn't have been launched.\" But a company such as Mazda cannot live on niches alone. Most of the cars which roll off the Hiroshima produc- tion line at the rate of one every 54 seconds are still the 121s, 323s, and 626s which the company describes as its \"bread and butter\". Maintain- ing such a solid base of main- stream vehicles is the third prong of the company's design and production strategies. There has also been new thinking on the company's approach to marketing. Mazda now has five sales chanpels, each aimed at a segment of-its customer base. They are designed to replace Japan's tra- ditional door-to-door sales sys- tem through the installation of attractive showrooms. The success of the new poli- cies is not immediately appar- ent in the statistics. Mazda's production and domestic sales are down slightly in the first six months of this year, and profits are forecast to fall from Y49.1bn to Y35bn for fiscal 1992 as a whole. But the decline in sales is an industry-wide phenomenon, with other manufacturers worse affected, and is expected to reverse towards the end of this year. The decline in profits is attributable to the increase in depreciation costs resulting from ambitious capital expen- diture over the last few years. Nonetheless, there are lon- ger term, more substantial problems facing Mazda and the rest of the Japanese motor industry.. An acute labour shortage is making it harder to recruit the workers and engi- neers which Mazda needs and is forcing employment costs upwards. As the company has to offer higher salaries to new redruits, so it has to adjust the pay of previously employed workers. The company's traditional response has been to automate. But a tour of even the oldest production lines at Hiroshima suggests there may be little more to be squeezed from the introduction of more robots. So now the solution is seen partly in new production sites. One of them is the compa- ny's factory in the neighbour- ing Yamaguchi prefecture. The decision to extend production facilities there reflected, among other things, the greater availability of labour. A second problem, common to the other Japanese car- makers, is the threat of protec- tionist sentiment in overseas markets. The big three US pro- ducers have accused Mazda of dumping mini-vans and are wary of the expanding share of Japanese cars at a time when the overall market is shrink- ing. The EC will maintain tough restrictions on Japanese car imports after 1992. To circumvent such dis- putes, Mazda's policy has been to localise production. Its sac- tory in Flat Rock, Michigan, produces 184,000 vehicles a year and satisfies most of the US demand for the 626, Maz- da's best-selling car in that market. Mazda is also negotia- ting with Ford, which holds almost 25 per cent of its shares, to set up a factory in Europe. Relocation of production, both in and outside Japan, seems to imply a weakening of Mazda's ties with its tradi- tional base in Hiroshima. But company officials try to refute that. \"This will always be our most important production site,\" says a company official. \"We built more than 1.2m vehicles here last year.\" For a long time to come, therefore, the loudest applause for a Mazda race victory is likely to be heard in Hiroshima port.",

   "text_content" : "MOST of the action in Japan's securities scandals has been in Tokyo, but regional financial institutions are concerned that their customers may have developed doubts about the fairness of the financial sys- tem. At the Hiroshima Stock Exchange, trading volume has been almost 40 per cent lower than last year. Local banks such as the Hiroshima-Sogo Bank, have felt the anger of their small and medium-sized corporate customers, who have not been given the favoured treatment accorded to leading industrial corporations by Jap- anese brokerages. Mr Koojiro Shinohara, chair- man of the Hiroshima-Sogo Bank, says that the scandals are a \"terrible thing\", and that he feels uncomfortable to be \"a member of the same financial world\". He suggests that \"for- eigners must think our system is very strange\". Smaller banks are under similar financial pressures to larger Japanese banks, which have slowed asset growth as part of their attempts to meet international capital adequacy standards and have seen the value of their substantial stock holdings eroded by the fall in the Tokyo market. Mr Shinohara says that Hiro- shima-Sogo's asset growth has been closely checked over the past year and conditions are still difficult: \"We emphasise the quality of growth and not the quantity. Our clients are smaller, local companies and we are attempting to ensure our future by targeting the next generation of Hiroshima investors and educating them about our bank's services.\" Cultivating customer loyalty has become a priority for local banks with the onset of Japa- nese interest rate deregulation, which is due to be completed in 1994, and is expected to give the large commercial banks an advantage over their smaller regional competitors. Mr Osamu Hashiguchi, presi- dent of Hiroshima Bank and chairman of the Regional Banks' Association of Japan, says that his institution is \"confident that it can com- pete\". He hopes that financial reform will include permission for banks to enter the securi- ties business, a proposal now under consideration by the Japanese government. \"We have 159 offices in Hiro- shima prefecture, which the big Tokyo banks cannot match. We should be able to cope with any challenge,\" says Mr Hash- iguchi, who is a former chair- man of Japan's Fair Trade Commission, the Tokyo-based anti-monopoly body, and is currently chairman of the Hiroshima Chamber of Com- merce and Industry. A sharp fall in land prices is one challenge that Japanese banks would not welcome. Prices in Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest cities, have been uneven, with a 20 per cent fall in condominium prices in some areas, and concerns that com- mercial prices will turn down. Mr Hashiguchi says that land price instability is \"basi- cally a problem for the metro- politan areas\", and that the Hiroshima property market has been helped by the antici- pated rush of development works in advance of the 1994 Asian Games. The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have directed banks to limit their exposure to the property mar- ket and to be cautious in the use of stocks as collateral. Such central directives are delivered at the local level through contact, for example, between Hiroshima branch officials of the central bank and executives at Hiroshima- Sogo. Mr Shinohara says that his bank has \"a close relationship\" with the Bank of Japan, and prepares a planning report every six months and \"receives guidance\" from central bank officials. The securities scandal has raised questions about the use of administrative guidance in Japan, and the finance min- istry has accepted that the sys- tem needs to be made more transparent. The Bank of Japan announced in late June that it would no longer issue quar- terly targets for bank lending growth, ending what is known as \"window guidance\". Mr Shi- nohara points out that window guidance has never been very strict, and that the central bank generally had confidence in the level of financial disci- pline of local banks. Financial discipline in the securities industry is a differ- ent question. Mr Shinohara says that his bank's clients, mostly smaller and medium- sized companies, have gener- ally not played the stock mar- ket as means of raising finance, as have many larger industrial companies: \"Stock speculation was part of a period of unreal growth and created a bubble economy.\" The Bank of Japan attempted to squeeze air out of that \"bubble\" by lifting official interest rates, which has put pressure on highly-geared spec- ulative companies and taken some heat from the stock mar- ket. Hiroshima Stock Exchange officials have felt the differ- ence, even though their exchange is Japan's smallest by trading volume. Apart from the main Tokyo exchange, there are seven Jap- anese exchanges, with the smaller institutions, such as Hiroshima, offering a few local- ly-listed stocks and the oppor- tunity to trade in certain stocks listed on the larger exchanges. Hiroshima handles 196 stocks, of which 187 are listed elsewhere and nine are unique to the exchange. Mr Hirosuke Shiji, Hiroshi- ma's director of listings, has a deep sense of regional respon- sibility: \"Our mission is to assist local companies. We can contribute to the revitalisation of the area by helping compa- nies to raise funds.\" The Hiroshima exchange traces its history back to 1755 and a dealing house for rice and cotton. Later this year, the exchange is scheduled to move into a new, Y800m building that will provide higher tech- nology links to the main exchanges and a large library for local clients. Exchange officials are hop- ing to encourage more local companies to list, and a recent survey found about 70 were interested. But there are now concerns that some of those companies and some of the potential investors will be scared away by the scandals in Tokyo. Mr Shiji says that the most obvious effect of the scandals in Hiroshima has been on share trading volume: \"The number of buy and sell orders has greatly decreased. Gener- ally speaking, ordinary cus- tomers have lost confidence. Robert Thomson",

   "text_content" : "John Ridding on the growing tourist industry EVERY year more people than live in Australia travel to Hiro- shima prefecture for sight- seeing and other tourist activi- ties. In so doing, the visitors generate total revenues of Y185.7bn ($1.3bn). For an area best known for the atomic bombing of 1945 and its subsequent regenera- tion into one of Japan's major industrial centres, tourism in Hiroshima is perhaps a surpris- ingly big business. The city and prefectural government are working on plans to make it even bigger. In so doing, they must strike a careful balance. The memory of the atomic bomb remains a highly emotive issue and Hiro- shima is determined to main- tain its image as a city of peace. At the same time, gov- ernment officials want to develop new attractions to draw the growing number of Japanese holidaymakers and visitors from overseas. This balance can be difficult. \"We don't want to put the image of the atom bomb to tourists,\" says Mr Hiroshi Isaka, director of the tourism division at the city govern- ment. \"It would be insensitive to survivors of the bomb.\" At the same time, new projects such as riverboat cruises have aroused controversy because of painful memories of the river after the bombing. Nonetheless, the first nuclear explosion in anger is what continues to draw most visitors to Hiroshima. The city's Peace Park has many monuments to the victims of the bomb. Several peace festi- vals during the year draw large numbers both from Japan and overseas. Increasingly, however, visi- tors are travelling to see the scenic attractions of Hiroshima prefecture and to special events and festivals which draw them from Tokyo, Osaka and other population centres. These domestic tourists dom- inate Hiroshima's tourist industry. Of the 18m people who visited the prefecture for tourism last year, all but 250,000 were Japanese from other areas. This type of tour- ist has also seen the strongest growth over the last five years. \"We Japanese are not the workaholics which you think we are,\" says Mr Akihiro Aoki, a manager at the Nihon Tour- ist Company. \"More and more people are travelling around the country on holiday or for leisure activities such as ski- ing, hiking or camping.\" On many of these counts, Hiroshima scores highly. It boasts a number of ski resorts and golf courses, attractive countryside and the Seitonai- kai, or Inland Sea, one of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in Japan. In an attempt to capitalise )n the trend towards health md sporting holidays Hirosh- ma is developing its golf ;ourses, hiking routes and namping areas. A more curious ittraction is New Zealand Vil- age, a joint public sector-pri- rate sector project which has *econstructed a typical Antipo- lean village aimed at demon- itrating the healthy life ,njoyed down under. But despite such efforts, the first stop for Japanese tourists continues to be the historic cities of Kyoto or Nara. \"I must admit, Hiroshima is not at the top of the list,\" says Mr Aoki, who gives its lack of historic buildings and monuments as the main reason. So for Hiroshima, the task is to keep coming up with events or spectacles to draw visitors to the region. In this respect there has been a fair degree of success. In 1989, The Sea And Land Exposition which promoted the attractive scenery of Japan's Inland Sea, drew just under 6m visitors. Every year the city of Hiroshima holds a flower festi- val, to coincide with the time when most Japanese people take their annual vacation. The result has been a steady increase in tourist numbers. Japanese visitors, including those travelling within Hiro- shima prefecture for tourist activities, rose from 27.9m in 1986 to 31.6m last year. A series of future crowd-pull- ers are also planned. By far the biggest is the 1994 Asian Games to be held in Hiro- shima. \"We think that the games will really put us on the map,\" says an official at the prefecture office. The Asian Games, it is hoped, will also increase the number of foreign visitors com- ing to Hiroshima. A new air- port is being built, one hour's drive east of the city, which will be able to handle interna- tional flights. Officials from .the prefecture's tourist office have been visiting neighbour- ing countries promoting the attractions of the region. For the foreseeable future, however, it will be domestic travellers who will keep Hiro- shima's tourist revenues flow- ing. And as the trend to work less and play more continues to take hold among Japanese people, so Hiroshima's tourist industry is set to expand. YAMAGUCHI- Shn-bnm ME 0 Miles 25 EHIME 0 Km 40",

   "text_content" : "EACH YEAR on August 6 thousands of Japanese and international visitors gather in Hiroshima's Peace Park to commemorate the dead. They mourn and pray for the souls of the many thousands who died following the American attack on Hiroshima with an atomic bomb on August 6, 1945. It is a moving historical com- memoration that is, nonethe- less, laden with contemporary meaning and continuing con- troversy. It is not just the dropping of the bomb that remains contro- versial, but also Japan's broader role in the Pacific War. With Hiroshima hosting the Asian Games in 1994, it is more important than ever that Hiro- shima, if not all of Japan, comes to terms with a past that it often prefers not to think about. The attack on Hiroshima was the first time an atomic bomb had been used in war- fare. The second and last attack took place a few days later at Nagasaki. The bomb that exploded high over Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning destroyed the city almost completely by the force of the blast and the fires that raged afterwards. The blast directly caused the death of about 144,000 people by the end of the year. The Peace Park, with the eerie atomic dome - the remaining steel structure that supported a domed building - was at the centre of the attack. The annual memorial in the park is a sombre ecumenical ceremony in which partici- pants are united by one view: that the bombing of Hiroshima was a terrible tragedy that should not be repeated. Yet beyond this, the bomb- ing is an ambiguous symbol and an enduring source of debate. Last month the Hiro- shima Memorial Peace Museum, located in the park, reopened with newly-reinstal- led galleries. The aim of the reinstallation was to make this record of the results of the blast more vivid, especially to young people. The hallway into the display is a reconstruction of broken brick buildings. Inside, wax fig- ures with burnt skin and tat- tered clothing wander barefoot amid burning buildings and debris. The story of the blast is made more personal by show- ing burnt toys, a lunch box and clothing, along with the story of the original owners who died. Large video displays show films of the destroyed city taken by the US army after the blast. Yet the displays are strangely devoid of both histor- ical and social context. A visitor who knew nothing else of the war would almost certainly conclude that Japan was merely an innocent victim of this terrible attack. Nowhere is there a clue that the bomb- ing of Hiroshima, which may indeed have been indefensible and mistaken on all sorts of grounds, came after a series of aggressive and brutal attacks by Japan on nearly all its neighbours and finally on the US itself. Koreans and others who sus- fered in the blast are men- tioned in the final panel of the exhibition, but efforts by Koreans to have relics of their suffering put into the display were spurned. A memorial to the Korean victims has been consigned to the periphery of the park. It is the apparent unwilling- ness of the Japanese to look squarely at the historical record that makes many of their neighbours nervous about a country that plays such a big economic, political and military role regionally. For Hiroshima, the symbol- ism of what the bombing of the city really means has become a more urgent issue because it will host the Asian Games in 1994. So it was a significant step when at this year's ceremony to commemorate the tragedy of Hiroshima, Mayor Takashi Hir- aoka for the first time apolo- gised for the suffering that Japan inflicted on the rest of Asia during the Second World War. It was, at least, a start toward mending old wounds. Steven Butler",

   "text_content" : "Colin Amery welcomes an appeal to help preserve the dual role of a Hawksmoor church N icholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736) is an architect whose work has the power to move. From the time when Sir Christopher Wren recog- nised his \"early skill and genius\" and took him into his employment as his clerk aged only 18, Hawksmoor's name has been associated with a rare architectural brilliance. Lon- don is a fortunate city by vir- tue of having so many of Hawksmoor's greatest works. His trio of amazing churches - Christ Church, Spitalfields, St. Anne Limehouse and St. George-in-the-East - although some of the finest products of 18th century art, are still somehow lost and neglected in the wastelands of London's East End. In almost any other European city they would be recognised and cher- ished as masterpieces - the equal of anything in Rome. Last week an appeal was launched to help one of these churches, St. George-in-the- East, to help make it a viable centre for its parish and to transform its crypt and court- yard into a working home for the Guildhall Ensemble. The Ensemble is the postgraduate arm of the Performance and Skills Department of the Guild- hall School of Music and Drama and for the last two years it has been based in the crypt of St. George's, where it carries out an unusual develop- ment programme bring music and performance training to all sections of the community. The dual use of St George's comes about because the church was badly bombed in the second world war and the Hawksmoor interior was not restored. Instead, inside the massive and marvellous walls, a small modern church was erected to the designs of the architect Arthur Bailey, and flats were squeezed into parts of the fabric. Today, St. George's stands opposite the refurbished Tobacco Dock. It is still a mag- nificent sight, soaring like a great stone galleon above the strange mixture of welfare housing and commercial oppor- tunism that now characterises London's Docklands. It looks intact from the street and it is a horrible shock to discover that Anglican pragmatism of the 1960s could not rise to con- template a complete restora- tion of one of the undoubted masterpieces of the English Baroque. The latest plans, announced last week, do not propose any further restoration. Instead the scheme, carefully prepared by architects Stanton and Wil- liams, leaves the 1960s church more or less as it is and pro- poses a new glazed atrium on the site of the present internal courtyard which will allow light to penetrate the crypt. It is a rational and intelli- gent way of utilising a dam- aged building to its fullest potential. Public rooms and galleries will be added at four levels and the 1960s church will feel less like a temporary addition sitting at the feet of a powerful ruin. The Guildhall Ensemble will also gain a good range of rehearsal and perfor- mance facilities. Does Hawksmoor benefit too? The new proposals respect his geometry more than the older ones did. The staggering sight of Hawksmoor's tower forcing its way through the split pediment will still be there on the west front. It will, in fact, be enhanced by the res- toration of Hawksmoor's own design for the steps. The appeal is a sensible one to support because it keeps a great ruin in active use and the musical activities clearly have a great social value. The fail- ure to restore the church as an architectural monument of European significance goes back to the immediate post war years. It remains a tragedy that the will to maintain and guard the work of one of the great English architectural geniuses has consistently been so weak. Architects and art bureaucrats endlessly sing the praises of Hawksmoor, but that is not enough. Poor old Christ Church, Spitalfields has not been much helped by the end- less music that has been per- formed there - its restoration should have received all the wealth of the City. The tragedy is that these masterpieces are in the East End of London - an area that has still not really benefitted from the unplanned development of Docklands nor from the profits of the ludi- crous giantism of Canary Wharf. At the Royal Institute of Brit- ish Architects Heinz Gallery, (21, Portman Square, London W1) there is a highly intelli- gent and enjoyable exhibition entitled Architectural Drawings of the Regency Period. It is organised by Giles Worsley, the architectural editor of Country Life who has also writ- ten good a book to go with the exhibition (published by Andre Deutsch, Â£25 hardback, Â£14.99 paperback) which is a welcome first volume in a series devoted to the thematic exploration of the riches of the RIBA Draw- ings Collection. I enjoyed the exhibition for two reasons. First, because it is agreeably didactic, explaining the developing role of the drawing as a tool that both helped the builder but also consolidated the position of the architect as the leader of the design team. Second, it deals with a period of English archi- tecture that is humane and pleasing to the eye and includes the work of Soane, Wilkins, Rickman, Playfair, Cockerell, Wyattville, Bonomi, Papworth and Nash. The arrangement of the book and exhibition by building types allows for the inclusion of large scale public buildings of the years of peace after the Napoleonic wars, and elegant domestic work that evokes a settled and modestly elegant private world. The develop- ment of the fine architectural perspective in this period pro- vides examples of the work of Josph Gandy (a remarkable scheme for a proposed \"impe- rial palace for sovereigns of the British empire\") and a very distinguished interior by Bon- omi. The inclusion of the work of lesser known architects helps to give a coherent view of a developing profession. It is particularly interesting to see the work of a man like Michael Searles, who is not well known but was in his way a pioneer of the elegant speculative devel- opment of Regency south Lon- don. A quiet afternoon in the Heinz Gallery at this exhibi- tion is both a restorative and educational experience. I'~' Ashley Ashwood",

   "text_content" : "Miles Davis, the jazz trumpeter, died in hospital of pneumonia on Satur- day, following a lifetime of poor health exacerbated by drug addic- tion. He was 65. Davis was arguably the most con- sistently influential figure in jazz since he first blew cool, aged 19, with Charlie Parker in 1945. The son of a dentist, Miles Dewey Davis III was born in Alton, Illinois, into a middle-class family. He went to the Juillard School of Music in New York, but was soon seduced by clubs, the sounds of bebop and Charlie Parker in particu- lar. By the end of the 1940s he was precociously leading his own nine- piece band and formulating the detached but supple sound which would be his abiding hallmark for the coming 40 years, even into his jazz-rock fusion period. After a period of relative inactivity in the early 1950s, Davis went into the creative jet-stream in 1955 which would carry him through to the mid- 1970s and breakdown. In this time, he formed the classic quintet of John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Cham- bers and Philly Joe Jones, to be fol- lowed by collaboration with Gil Evans and his sublime orchestral arrangements. \"I don't play that way any more\", he would insist subsequently. Ironi- cally, he did, at his last major appearance, in Montreux, this summer. After his ground-breaking work with Evans, Davis formed a new quintet which brought Herbie Han- cock and Wayne Shorter to promi- nence and initiated a new way with small group improvisation, carrying jazz into the mid-1960s. In a frenzy of activity towards the end of that decade, he changed direction again and virtually invented jazz-rock fusion. In the middle of this musical for- ment, he was kicking a heroin addic- tion, picked up alongside other jazz musicians as a hip habit, and sus- taining a cocaine dependency. In 1975, Davis finally conked out, both sick and tired, and stayed out of action until 1980, when he returned looking rattled but renewed creatively and armed with more elec- tronics and tougher rock lines. A musician whose arrogant and unyielding personality was at odds with the emotional depth and breadth of his work, Davis, sick with diabetes, signed off his recent auto- biography saying he didn't have time to worry about death. \"The urgency to play and create music today is worse than when I started. It's more intense. It's like a curse.\" Ganry Hooth \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The tour starts at the Queen Eliza- beth Hall on London's South Bank (October 9) before taking in 11 pro- vincial venues. Later in the month, Ferguson Jazz starts its autumn programme with the first British performance of Charles Mingus' Epitaph at London's Barbican (October 21). The two-hour long score was discovered after the musician's death and prepared for performance by Gunther Schuller, who will conduct a 31-piece Ameri- can orchestra for the London perfor- mance. The 1991 Guinness Cork Jazz Fes- tival is slated for the end of the month (October 25-28). More than 100 gigs will take place in over 50 halls, hotels and pubs with the organisers expecting 40,000 visitors. Headline details have yet to be finalised but Gerry Mulligan, John Surman and Red Mitchell, among others, have been confirmed. Ronnie Scott, who will also be at Cork, opens his new Birmingham club that same weekend (October 28) with Rolling Stones drummer Char- lie Watts leading a jazz quartet which features Pete King on alto-sax.",

   "text_content" : "IDOCKENIEIMUIER DEPOT, FRANKFURT The miracle about Goethe's play is that it is performed at all. Even in Goethe's day it was regarded as reflective poem rather than theatre and he had to look hard for producers and harder for audiences. A comparison between this version and the TheAtre du Soleil's Iphigenia in Aulis - now star of the Berliner Festwochen, which I caught on tour this summer - urges the same conclusion: where Ariane Mnouchkine can inject carnival spirit and dramatic high jinks into Euripides, Goethe - whose source was Euripides' earlier Iphigenia in Tauris - all but excludes action. The Germans euphemistically call this Seelendrama, drama of the soul, where action, conflict, crisis turn inward and are expressed mostly through musing soliloquy. Yet the work is abidingly popular in the German repertory - along with this opening, it runs in Berlin's Schiller Theater and is promised later in the Cologne season. Why, why, why? Herbert Kreppel pleads a valiant case. Kreppel is a sensitive Goethe scholar who has done wonders with the scalpel, pulling five acts into under two hours and turning tedious monologue into dialogue and dramatic exchange without ever betraying Goethe's poetry. His cast speak verse like music, grand and lyrical yet emerging naturally out of character and situation. Poetic sensuality offsets the starkness of story and setting: Bert Kistner's set is almost bare, a raised circular yellow platform with Diana's statue a rough abstract sculpture at one side. Costumes are simple black and white robes; faces are blackened, heads shaved; there is no music. Weimar classicism beaten into life it remains. Kornelia Boje is an intense Iphigenia, languishing as Diana's priestess in Tauris, passionately homesick and uncertain in her debt to her host Thoas, but still primarily a cipher for Goethe's religious dilemmas. Her brother Orestes (Siemen Ruhaak), mad, driven Greek pursued by the Furies and washed up unrecognised and unrecognising in Tauris, is a philosophising 18th century Hamlet; Goethe used to play the part himself. Only Klaus Henner Russius' Thoas, the barbarian king whom Iphigenia has \"civilised\" by love and rational chat, convinces. Torn between demanding human sacrifice for political ends and setting Orestes free with Iphigenla, Thoas yields. The two moments of pure drama in this production are his: trying to imprison Iphigenia in chains, he changes his mind and clasps her in embrace; letting her leave Tauris, he refuses to say goodbye, forcing her to break out, this time from Orestes' grasp, and grab his hand to beg a last farewell. He remains a tragic figure, alone and in trouble as brother and sister rejoice. An impressive final scene, but a long wait for it. : Jackie Wullschlager",

   "text_content" : "BIENNALE DE LA MUSIQUE FRANQAISK, LYON Berlioz's last \"opera\" Beatrice et Benedict might have been the showpiece of Lyon's \"Biennale de la musique francaise\". He was a local boy, after all, and if his B&B. is a tad eccentric, some of its numbers are gems of the first water. Though many British music-lovers have known that for some time, thanks to Colin Davis (on records), the Buxton Festival and the ENO, revivals in France have been scanty. While Lyon had its annual Berlioz Festivals - which ended when they ran out of Berlioz - it did stage B&B, ten years ago; but the slender first-night audience for this new version suggested that the earlier one had made no great mark. The trouble with B&B is that it's not quite an opera, nor anything else exactly. The Shakespeare-besotted composer merely set his favourite bits of Much Ado about Nothing to music (rather as he'd done more grandly with Romeo and Juliet) - and omitted the basic plot. What he first envisaged was a light, bubbling one-acter, for which the prickly banter of B6atrice and Bdndick and their mutual capitulation would suffice as a story, with the (boringly unclouded) betrothal of Hdro and Claudio as background, and a new \"comic\" figure - the music-master Somarone, a dire addition - as a loose cannon. Most of the 15 musical numbers are jovial choruses and stage-music, but the best of the few numbers allotted to the principals are seriously operatic, searching and long. Eventually, therefore, B&B had to stretch to two acts - unfortunately without any sustaining plot. British solutions have restored more of the well-loved banter, to give life to the central pair, for Lyon the producer Pierre Barrat, more ambitious, aimed to reinstate the gist of Shakespeare's action (with Bdatrice's \"Kill Claudio!\" and all). It didn't quite work. At well over three hours it took at least as long as the spoken play, reduced here to snippets (faithfully translated, but they raised scarcely a laugh anywhere). Too little to flesh out the jesting lovers; and far too little to make the \"dark\" side of the piece - the Claudio-Hdro-Borachio imbroglio - theatrically effective. For that Berlioz wrote no music, and the gaps between the operatic items began to yawn. Laurent Peduzzi's expansive, clean-lined setting was seductive: the whole end of a palazzo at one side, a lush wooded garden at the other, and between them a glowing, indeterminate vista of Mediterranean blue. Claude Beringuier engineered a magical twilight whilst Hdro and Ursule (Danielle Borst and Catherine Robbin) sang their haunting Nocturne-Duo, at the close of Act I. Earlier, however, Miss Borst had just about got away with her heroically taxing air, and Tibbre Raffalli's B6nddick, a bumptious gay blade, had sacrificed Berlioz's elegant line to a few stinging top-notes. Later, Hdlbne Perraguin's sprightly Beatrice lacked the dramatic grip for her great scena of self-discovery. (We who have heard Anne Murray have been spoiled.) Despite his sharp ear for Berliozian essentials, the conductor John Nelson fixed no clear shape for it, nor -,r lie taut, teasing women's trio t follows. Gab .el Bacquier's ripe, rank Somarone was allowed to go over the top, to no purpose. In the final Scherzo duettino - a twinkling reprise of the familiar Overture, but with the voices of Beatrice and Benddick now supplying wry phrases that should seem to have been implicit in the music all along - he let the singers gasp their lines like mere recitativo asides. In short, for all its civilised charms this well-intentioned B&B failed to crack the crucial nuts. * Elsewhere in the Biennale, there were still splendid rediscoveries. If d'Indy's Second Quartet sounded grimly academic (using the motto of Mozart's \"Jupiter\"-Schluss-Fuge to generate everything, but without the expressive range to vary the effect), his op. 89 Triple Concerto - piano, flute, cello - gleamed with polished conviction. Saint-Saens came off very well: with the Ensemble Orchestral de Paris under Theodor Guschlbauer his Second Symphony sounded crisply, neo-classically cogent, and the late Fantaisie for violin and harp (Gerard Poulet and Isabelle Moretti, both excellent) found him trying out bold modernisms. The American trumpeter Steven Burns was exciting in Andre Jolivet's splashy 1948 Concertino. The organist-composer Louis Vierne's 1917 Piano Quintet left the deepest impression. Some months ago I reviewed a recording of it rather coolly, but at Lyon we had an impassioned, revelatory performance by Gerhard Oppitz and the distinguished Quatuor Prat (we need to hear them in London, though not billed as the \"Prat Quartet\"). When Vierne wrote it he had just lost his brother and his 17-year-old son in the Great War; he was himself going blind, and had come close to suicide. With quotations from Siegfried's Funeral March and Tristan, the Quintet is a searing elegy with agonised, end-of-tether suspensions. The Prat team seemed to fathom it completely, and it made a heart-wrenching experience. David Murray",

   "text_content" : "THE US president's latest nuclear arms initiative has rightly been hailed as one of the most far-reaching contribu- tions to reducing the risk of nuclear war since the begin- ning of US-Soviet arms control negotiations. But there is a risk that its shock effect - few people expected another big nuclear arms control push so soon after the signature of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty last July - will lead people to draw the wrong con- clusions. While it is certainly aimed at further sharp cuts in nuclear arsenals, it will not rid the world of all nuclear weap- ons. Indeed, its merits are that it avoids the leap in the dark which former US President Ronald Reagan offered to make at his notorious Reykjavik summit in 1986 with Mr Mik- hail Gorbachev, when he pro- posed the complete abolition of nuclear weapons. At that time, he was restrained by Washing- ton's European Nato partners - not least Mrs Margaret Thatcher - from taking a step which would have left Europe dangerously exposed to a Soviet conventional attack. Since then, the international political and military environ- ment has changed radically. Last year's treaty cutting con- ventional forces in Europe, Moscow's withdrawal from eastern Europe and the pro- gressive disintegration of the Soviet Union, have virtually eliminated the danger of a con- ventional Soviet attack in Europe. Yet the chaos and insecurity that the political upheavals in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have brought in their wake, coupled with the outbreak of unpredictable regional crises such as the Gulf conflict, have alerted the US and its western allies to the need to maintain credible, if reduced defences. It is the nuclear deterrent, after all, which has prevented serious conflicts in Europe over the past 45 years. Superb timing The timing of Mr Bush's ini- tiative and the political judge- ment on which it is based could not have been better. As he said in his speech on Fri- day, there was now an unparal- leled opportunity to change what he called \"the nuclear posture\" of both the US and the Soviet Union. The Start treaty provides for a reduction of no more than 25 to 30 per cent of both countries' strate- gic arsenals. Yet the Soviet Union's economic reform plans require the conversion of its overblown and costly military industry into factories produc- ing much-needed goods for a peace-time economy. Mr Bush also had to take into account the nuclear secu- rity problem caused by the imminent break-up of the Soviet Union into independent republics. Mutual nuclear deterrence has to be based on confident predictions of the other side's behaviour in a cri- sis. But in the absence of cen- tralised control of nuclear weapons - Belorussia and Kazakhstan have already shown themselves extremely reluctant to transfer their mis- siles to Russia - such predic- tions become extremely uncer- tain and hazardous. Better, therefore, to strike while the iron is hot and there is still a good chance of negotiating a nuclear arms agreement with the central Soviet government under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. US sweeteners The sweeteners to such an agreement offered by Mr Bush are substantial. Though the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe and other locations has been fore- seen for a long time in Nato strategy, the decision to elimi- nate all nuclear cruise missiles from US warships is a real con- cession to the Soviet Union. During the Gulf war, Moscow had expressed deep concern that warships carrying these missiles, which are very diffi- cult to detect, had come within range of Soviet territory. Yet a much more difficult prospect is the abolition by both sides of all land-based intercontinental ballistic mis- siles with multiple warheads, as proposed by Mr Bush. Since this proposal is not matched by an offer to scrap submarine- launched ballistic missiles, an area in which the US has a clear lead over the Soviet Union, an agreement might prove difficult to reach. Founded though its position is on a determination to retain a credible nuclear deterrent, it seems likely that the US will, in the end, have to envisage some reductions in sea- launched strategic missiles in the interests of reaching an overall deal with the Soviet Union. In that case, Britain and France will no longer be able to argue, as they still do today, that the large nuclear arsenals of the superpowers justify their own \"minimum deterrents\". Mr Bush's far-reaching pro- posals also imply that London and Paris are fast approaching the moment when they have to review their own nuclear defence policies and participate in the nuclear arms control process.",

   "text_content" : "EARLIER this month the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) said in a discus- sion paper on the regulation of retail investment products in the UK that it wanted inves- tors to be able to \"take full advantage of the dynamic and innovative UK market place for financial services\". Just three weeks later National Westminster Bank announced that it has given up the struggle to be the last big high street provider of inde- pendent financial advice. Its customers will routinely be sold only own brand invest- ment products. Abbey National, too, has decided to sell its own life products rather than those of an independent company, Friends Provident. The pattern is established right across the retail banking industry. The alarming fact is that the innovative and competitive independent life insurance companies are being largely replaced by in-house product \"manufacturers\" geared to deliver standardised contracts of probably indifferent perfor- mance. Historically, the unique character of Britain's invest- ment industry derived from the existence of a dominant distribution network of inde- pendent brokers, which encouraged the development of independent life and invest- ment companies. Under attack But the system has been under attack from two direc- tions directselling companies such as Abbey Life and Allied Dunbar, and the big banks and building societies. When the legislation for the protection of investors was reformed through the Financial Services Act 1986, it was vital that the high street banking sector should be retained as a distri- bution channel for the indepen- dent life and unit trust comp- nies. Unfortunately, the authorities succumbed to pres- sure from the independent bro- kers and some of the life com- panies to adopt so-called \"polarisation\", which meant that any intermediary had to choose between independent status or be restricted to the products of just one company. Special relationships Intermediaries feared that if special relationships with just a few companies were permit- ted the conflicts of interest could only be resolved through full disclosure of commissions, which they know would lose them a lot of business. Second, they reasoned that polarisation would cripple the power of the banks to establish financial supermarkets The hope that some big retail chains would retain inde- pendent status has now proved an illusion. The next stage must be a structural crisis among the independent life companies, which can now only sell to people able to afford independent financial advisers. There are parallels with the stock market \"Big Bang\" of 1986 which rebounded against small investors and placed large financial institutions under great pressures. The Financial Services Act, which came fully into effect in 198., has not been directed suff- ciently towards protecting investors. The unique character of the UK's long-term investment industry is being squandered. As a first step, the polarisation rules should be relaxed, to allow the banks' independent advisory hoots, which they still retain on a restricted basis, much better access to the branches. The SIB could propom this as pat of its cur- rent review of polari . Second, there is a case for considering closer political ov oft SIB and its subld- lary self-regulatory organisa- tions, and whether vested interests are over-represented among the watcldMog."

   "text_content" : "President Bush's arms control proposals do not obscure a tough decision over direct aid to the Soviet Union, writes Lionel Barber P resident George Bush has seized the moment. His wide- ranging proposal for reduc- tions in US-Soviet nuclear weapons is the first significant response from the west to the new Russian revolution; as usual, the tim- ing was finely judged. In one stroke, Mr Bush has dis- armed those critics at home and abroad who were starting to complain that his reaction to the collapse of Soviet communism was timid and unimaginative. Now, with some justi- fication, he can claim to have set in motion the most sweeping changes in US defence strategy in 40 years. Mr Bush's proposals - unveiled in a nationwide address on Friday night - come just as the Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and his Rus- sian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, are engaged in high-stakes talks to save the union. The US arms control plan is aimed at strengthening their hand in negotiations with the 15 republics; the billion-dollar question is whether Mr Bush, having offered to lift the burden of the nuclear arms race, is prepared to tackle the even trickier issue of economic aid. Under the president's plan, the US will withdraw all short-range nuclear weapons from Europe; remove all tac- tical nuclear weapons from all US submarines and warships; end a 24- year alert status for all US strategic bombers; and accelerate the 30 per cent cuts agreed under the Start treaty recently signed with the Soviet Union on long-range missiles. There is, however, a little less to Mr Bush's offer than meets the eye. Some of his proposals can be reversed, if the Soviets fail to respond. His call even- tually to eliminate all land-based mul- tiple warhead missiles singles out for destruction the most destabilising nuclear weapons on the Soviet side. US superiority in submarine-based systems remains intact. Indeed, Mr Bush has no intention of abandoning America's air-, sea-, and land-based nuclear triad; he is stick- ing to plans in place before the abor- tive Soviet coup, to draw down US armed forces by 25 per cent; and he is loath to cancel any important non-nu- clear weapons system. Prudence, it seems, can only be stretched so far. The greatest impact of Mr Bush's proposals will be psychological. His offer to remove sea-launched cruise missiles, where the US enjoys a long-standing technological edge, sug- gests that he has finally ditched post- war American fears about \"missile gaps\" and Soviet nuclear superiority. The Soviet threat has diminished; now, in Mr Bush's words on Friday night, the US stands ready to \"help\". Just how far is the president pre- pared to go to assist in the political and economic transformation of America's old adversary? The answer, says one senior US official, will depend a great deal on events in Moscow, primarily whether the new Soviet leadership and the republics can agree on power-sharing arrange- ments and a new economic treaty. At this early stage, powerful voices are urging Mr Bush to be bold. The most prominent is Mr James Baker, US Sec- retary of State. Mr Baker visited Moscow this month, holding talks with top Soviet officials and leaders of the Baltic states. He even flew to Kazakhstan to meet the republican leader Mr Nursal- tan Nazarbayev. Mr Baker's message to Washington was unequivocal: the failed August coup wiped out hard-core, high-level opposition to reform. \"We are dealing with a very different country,\" says one senior administration official. Thus, Mr Vadim Bakatin, the head of the KGB, asked Mr Baker whether the CIA could offer lessons on how to manage a spy service in a democracy. General Yevgeny Shapashnikov, the Soviet defence minister, inquired about the US military justice system, offering the breathtaking admission that it was vital to restore the public's trust in the Red Army as an impartial _Â· Â· and volunteer fighting force. Later, General Shapashnikov asked about US base rights agreements with its allies. The most likely explanation, says one senior US official, is that the leadership wants to create a new legal basis for stationing troops in the Soviet republics. Such talk convinced Mr Baker that the revolution presents the US and the west with an historic opportunity to redefine their wary posture towards the Soviet Union. President Gorbachev further helped his cause by pledging to end the Soviet military presence in Cuba and to cut off arms supplies to Afghanistan. He also showed willingness to resolve the Kurile Islands territorial dispute with Japan; senior US officials are engaged in trying to broker a compromise between Moscow and Tokyo so that Japan regains the islands. These Soviet concessions may have been an act of desperation, but they served one important purpose: the removal of the political obstacles which President Bush has most fre- quently cited in opposing direct US financial assistance. A new mood has developed within the administration. \"The consensus,\" says a senior west- ern official, \"is that the prospects for reform are much better than before.\" Yet this optimism has to be set against the titanic task ahead. In their recent trip to Moscow, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, heard confirma- tion that the Soviet authorities are fast running out of hard currency, creating severe liquidity problems and a dangerous squeeze on much- needed imports. The unspoken fear is that even if Moscow does not declare a morato- rium on its $62bn foreign debt, it may require a western bridging loan of at least $lbn within the next few weeks to meet its obligations. The immediate US imperative is to avoid chaos this winter. An interna- tional relief campaign, which may rival Herbert Hoover's successful effort to prevent famine in the Soviet Soviet concessions removed the political obstacles President Bush has cited in opposing direct US financial aid Union in the early 1920s, is under way. Working with its partners in the Group of Seven industrialised nations, the US wants an assessment of Soviet needs for food and humanitarian aid within the next few days. On macroeconomic reform, the US is still moving gingerly. Senior offi- cials stress technical co-operation in areas such as food distribution, energy and the conversion of defence plants to civilian use - all of which ought to provide the hard currency needed to ease the Soviet payments crisis. Equally pressing is the need for contract and property laws; the US view remains that foreign investment, through the private sector, is the most efficient vehicle for the transi- tion to a market economy. Yet the administration is slowly coming to realise that if the great gamble of Soviet economic reform is undertaken, then direct US financial aid is a must. The US contribution would, of course, be part of a collec- tive western effort, but this still raises the problem of selling the idea to a US Congress which wants American dol- lars spent on domestic needs such as education and health care. With the federal budget deficit likely to grow to more than $350bn next year, an elec- tion year, Mr Bush will have to mus- ter every pound of political capital to defend direct financial aid to the Soviet Union which is certain to run into billions of dollars. These political pressures explain why the US is prepared to drop its long-standing opposition to the Soviet Union - or whatever confederation follows - becoming a full member of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The prospective shift in US policy is critical, since it would allow the Soviet authorities to borrow directly from a neutral international financial institution with far greater resources than the US. Some dissenting voices still need to be persuaded. The US Treasury is worried that Soviet membership could jeopardise efforts to secure congres- sional approval for a 50 per cent increase in the IMF's resources, the so-called quota increase. Also, lack of adequate data on Soviet gold and for- eign currency reserves could compli- cate admission, as well as the Trea- sury's reluctance to upset the redistri- bution of IMF membership quotas agreed, with great difficulty, only a year ago. These are minor technical issues set against the huge potential gains at stake in a demilitarised Soviet Union which becomes a full member of the international community of nations. But substantial questions remain over western support for a reform package, how it is arranged and the conditions under which it might become avail- able. This is likely to be a central issue of debate - but not decision - at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Bangkok next month. In the meantime, the administra- tion is pulling out all the stops for the dual leadership of Presidents Gorba- chev and Yeltsin, \"the new force for stability\". Indeed, Mr Bush's nuclear arms proposals may well have served as a valuable bargaining chip for the two in their campaign to preserve some central control in their negotia- tions with the breakaway republics. The administration views with alarm the possibility of a total break-up of the Soviet Union and is looking for evidence of a strengthened central leadership. When President Gorbachev last week persuaded Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former for- eign minister, and several other lead- ing reformers to join his advisory council, a sigh of relief echoed across the Potomac. During his trip to Moscow, Mr Baker heard bleak warnings about the risks of disintegration of central authority. Among others, Mr Shevard- nadze expressed grave concern about the repercussions of total indepen- dence for the Ukraine which could provoke a chain reaction. The scenario is that first, the Rus- sian minority would rise up; Kharkov, the Crimea, Odessa and the Donetsk coal basin would follow; that in turn could provoke the 40 per cent Russian population in Kazakhstan to seek to join Russia. The risk would be a Yugoslav-style civil war, or worse, Mr Baker was told. Such nightmares were current even before August's failed coup and per- suaded Mr Bush to deliver what has come to be known as the \"Chicken Kiev\" speech in July. Addressing the Ukrainian parliament, Mr Bush warned against \"suicidal nationalism\" and came out strongly in favour of a Soviet Union which retained central control, albeit within a democratic federal framework. Critics seized on the speech, not unreasonably, as a thinly disguised effort to bolster President Gorbachev at the expense of the republics. Senior US officials say this misses the point: the totalitarian centre has been smashed, and the republics have seized power. The challenge is how to reconstitute some central authority in the interests of stability and economic coherence. There is little doubt that the Ukraine is central to US thinking. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, visited the White House last week and was given the full photo-op- portunity treatment. A more interest- ing session occurred later, when Mr Kravchuk was invited to attend a one- hour meeting with Mr Ed Hewett, a senior specialist in the Soviet econ- omy on the National Security Council staff. By one account, Mr Hewett gently informed Mr Kravchuk of the advantages - and disadvantages - of full-scale secession from the union. This candour is a visible part of the new US-Soviet relationship. Mr Bush has taken a further step towards end- ing the Soviet image in the US of being Public Enemy Number One through his arms control proposals. The next challenge is whether such candour permits the US and its allies to state flatly that there can be no multi-billion-dollar rescue plan for the Soviet economy unless the key con- stituent parts, including the Ukraine, remain together. The message from Washington is: the centre must hold. Bush's initiative is aimed at helping Yeltsin. left, and Gorbachev, centre, in their talks with the republics",

   "text_content" : "* Obituaries of Roy Fuller, the distinguished British poet who died on Friday, rightly concentrated on his sharp eye, his quiet wit and his intellectual authority. But he was also a special hero for those who toil in the prosaic world of commerce and finance. For nearly 50 years, he climbed steadily up the promotion ladder at the Woolwich Building Society, and was still the society's full-time solicitor when elected to the Oxford professorship of Poetry in 1968. Along with volumes of poetry, novels and criticism, his publications included \"Questions and Answers in Building Society Law and Practice.\" His views on the building society movement (never industry) seem especially relevant in today's harsh climate. \"The safety of the investors' cash (and its bearing sufficient interest to retain them) was obviously paramount,\" he wrote. \"But borrowers were treated with as much leniency as was consonant with sensible management; in individual cases of disaster usually with generosity.\" Not surprisingly, he regretted the Building Societies Act of 1986. \"As with so many things in one's lifetime - bread, schooling, dress, manners - the enviable friendly society status, invention by British genius of a fair institution for spreading home ownership, was laid open for destruction.\" His politics, like his poetry, were not what you might expect of a building society official. But he did move to the right in later years, and rhythm and metre were more important to him than political precision \"Im overdond of Uncle Joe,\" he once wrote, but later confessed that the choice of verb had really been determineT by the metre. \"oo lenient to Unoe Joe\" would have been more accurate, he claimed. Business lunch * The spirit of risk-taking free enterprise spawned by the Business Expansion Scheme lives on. A group of London socialites, including Taki Theo- doracopulos, a columnist for the Spectator magazine, and Sir Ian Gilmour, Conservative MP and former arch-wet cabi- net minister, is using the BES to launch a restaurant in Covent Garden. The restaurant will be known as Christopher's The American Grill, after Christo- pher Gilmour, son of Sir lan, who will run the restaurant Typical menus will include corn-fed American beef and Maine lobsters. The restaurant's interior decor might be another incen- tive for potential investors - it will feature a mural depict- ing \"all the Restaurant's inves- tors, prominent London per- sonalities and its better known customers\". Sappers united a Welbeck College, one of the the British army's last male- only bastions, is going coed in September 1992. Welbeck is the army's reai- dential college for students studying for scientific and technical pre-university entry public examinations, and is traditionally an important start for aspirants to top poets in engineering and technical regiments. Women may now oin all British regiments and corps on an equal basis, except com- bat units. There will be around 30 places for females at the college, out of a total 170. Wel- beck graduates of suffcdent calibre go on to the Royal Mle- tary Academy at Sandhurst. Only one minor concern overshadows the demolition of Welbeck's gender divisions. Although the young men and women will be quartered in separate barracks, the col- lege and its grounds are a war- ren of underground tunnels, constructed in the nineteenth century by the eccentric 5th Duke of Portland. A publicity- shy character, the Duke also built an underground ballroom and a lengthy tunnel linking his mansion to the local rail- way station. Map-reading might become the most favoured course. Small fraud * Russia's first domestically-is- sued Visa charge card, issued by Credobank, a small private Moscow bank, has just started operati. Russian credit card fraud is already busy, practised on cards ued in Russia by westerners. By world standards the scale of fraud is low - 0.05 per cent of total car transactions against a global average of 0.13 per cent. It is also fairly easy to spot Only 1,000 places In the Soviet Union accept plastic; 80 per s AIR E logE ooil NUCLEAR FREE i2 ONE cent of the fraud happens at 20 outlets. Perhaps the next issue of American Express's Expressions could warn us of the hotspots. Quick kill * Howard Hodgson, who as the head of a chain of funeral directors was once responsible for burying one in ten of Britain's dead, is back on the corporate scene. Hodgson, who sold his stake in his old company earlier this year, is launching a manage- ment consultancy company in conjunction with, among others, Mr John Gunn, best known as the chief executive of British & Commonwealth, which collapsed last year. Hodgson, who has a book coming out called How to be Dead Rich, has no intention of jeopardising the consider- able fortune he amassed as a funeral director. Recently turned 40, Hodgson considers he has reached \"half time\" in his business career. He has put aside Â£200,000 for new ven- tures, but has invested the rest more conservatively. \"I did not want to wake up when rm 45 and find rd lost it all,\" he said. Face lift SBritain lost considerable face recently; it left out an important paragraph on invest- ment protection in Hong Kong in the joint communique of the Sino-British Joint LSaison Group, which has just held its 20th meeting in London. Such negligence could have been seen by the Chinese as ooitflcally-mottvate But after MrJomhn Major's sucesm visit to Bfing earlier this month, Chinese offcials sprang to the red-faced Foreign Omice'sdeence. \"The meeting had only just flnished and they hd to pre. pare their -o-i- es ry quicly,\" they sUK1 m out their own coplate txt of the cmmnique in ngh, with brod afles",

   "text_content" : "Alice Rawsthorn and Raymond Snoddy on the latest assault on the UK net book agreement Winnie the Pooh, the honey-loving bear featured in A A Milne's children's books, cuts an unlikely figure in the thrusting world of business. But this weekend Winnie was drawn into the bitter battle between Britain's book pub- lishers and book sellers. The Winnie the Pooh Story- book was one of 20 books which Dillons, the chain of bookshops owned by Mr Terry Maher's Pentos group, sold at a discounted price on Saturday in its latest attack on the net book agreement (NBA), the mechanism that sets minimum prices for most books. Dillons' discounting seems to have worked. Mr Maher said the Pooh Storybook, a set of books which had not sold at all in some Dillons' shops at the original price of Â£60, became one of the chain's best sellers at its new price of Â£45. Mr Maher, who claims Dil- ions' sales were 10 per cent higher this Saturday than the Â£700,000 usually taken on the same day at this time of year, is determined to press ahead with his campaign against the NBA. He is doing so despite an injunction granted to the Pub- lishers' Association on Friday to prevent him selling books at a discount without the publish- ers' permission. Dillons is able to continue because Reed Inter- national, whose book busi- nesses include Octopus and Seeker & Warburg, now pub- lishes its books outside the agreement. Later this week Waterstones, which is owned by W H Smith, the biggest single player in book retailing, will almost cer- tainly enter the battle by cut- ing the prices of Reed books. Mr Tim Waterstone, chairman, has supported the NBA in the past but said he had no option but to join the price war by discounting \"deeper and wider than Dillons\" for fear of losing ground. The initiative by Dillons and Waterstones represents the most serious threat to date to the NBA. If other book sellers join in, and other publishers follow Reed's example, the NBA could soon become redun- dant. Industry opinion is divided over the net book agreement. Some dismiss it as an anachro- nism that artificially inhibits book sales. Others see it as a sorely needed source of protec- tion for small bookshops and independent publishers. Both camps agree that the threat to the NBA comes at a very sensitive time for Britain's publishers. The book industry has already been hit by a sharp fall in sales in one of the worst recessions it has known. At the same time the publishers are struggling to adjust to the structural changes in their market: the growing power of the retail sector and the emergence of the new breed of multinational publishing groups. The critical question for the industry is whether it would be able to cope with the end of the NBA at a time when it is already weakened. The consensus in the indus- try is that the number of books sold to the public - which account for two-thirds of the Â£2.1bn overall UK market, according to the Euromonitor research consultancy - is down by between 10 and 15 per cent on 1990. Publishers have been forced to cut costs by reducing the number of books printed and publishing fewer new titles. There have been thousands of job losses across the 18,000- strong industry. The Publish- ers Association recorded 600 redundancies in one month alone earlier this year. The impact of the recession has been intensified by the industry's internal problems. One problem is the backlog of high advances paid to authors in the 1980s, such as the esti- mated Â£625,000 paid to Michael Holroyd for his literary biogra- phy of George Bernard Shaw. These advances were paid on books which are being pub- lished now when demand is depressed. Some publishers will not recover their invest- ment. The industry is also destabil- ised by the acquisitions of the 1980s. These were the deals that created the multinational publishers such as HarperCol- lins, part of Mr Rupert Mur- doch's News Corporation, and Random House, owned by Mr SI Newhouse, the US publish- ing magnate, as well as the Reed book business. The battle over the NBA is certain to make book publishing even more competitive The formation of the multi- nationals was followed by a stream of restructuring as they reduced overheads by pooling areas such as sales, distribu- tion, purchasing, printing and administration. This restruct- uring has almost certainly added to the job losses. So far the multinationals have had mixed success. Their supporters, such as Mr Alberto Vitale, chairman of Random House, claim they have already achieved impressive, though unspecified, improvements in productivity. Their critics, such as Mr Matthew Evans, chairman of Saber, the inde- pendent London publisher, still say the culture of a large com- pany is not compatible with \"a batty business like publishing where profits fluctuate wildly from year to year\". However the multinationals could become more powerful in the future if the NBA disap- peared and they were able to exploit the competitive advan- tage of size. Their ability to do so would depend on the extent to which the NBA's abolition encouraged the book sellers to demand higher discounts from their suppliers' publishers, thereby squeezing publishers' margins. Publishers' margins are already under pressure because of the expansion of the large chains of book shops, notably W H Smith and Pentos, during the 1980s. Euromonitor estimates that one in every three books are now sold by just six chains. These chains have been able to negotiate higher discounts than small, independent book- sellers. If the NBA disappeared they might demand even big- ger discounts to help them to cut the price of books. Mr Maher certainly intends to do so. At present Reed gets the same margins on the books it sells to Dillons, regardless of whether they are discounted. Mr Maher said that, in future, if Pentos orders 10,000 copies of a novel he plans to discount, rather than the 1,000 he would usually order, he will expect better terms from the pub- lisher. Mr Maher, and the NBA's other critics, argue that, if the agreement were abolished, book sales would increase because retailers would be in a better position to promote their products. Some publish- ers are concerned that, even if he is right, the increase in sales might not be sufficient to compensate for the fall in their margins. This would almost certainly intensify the pressure on small, independent publishing houses which, unlike the mul- tinationals, would not be able to offset a reduction in prices by exploiting the benefits of economies of scale. The small houses might then be squeezed out of mainstream publishing and be forced to become more specialist. Alter- natively they might be forced to form links with the multina- tionals. One small London house, Sinclair Stevenson, has already sold a stake to Reed. Another, the Everyman Library, has delegated respon- sibility for distribution to Ran- dom House. At the same time the NBA's abolition could make life more difficult for independent book sellers, given that they would not have the same clout as the chains to demand high dis- counts from publishers to cut the price of books. In the US, where minimum book prices have long since been abolished, there are proportionally fewer mainstream independent book- shops, but small, specialist booksellers are flourishing. If the same scenario were replicated in the UK, the book market would be locked in a vicious cycle as big book chains and multinational pub- lishers gained ground at the expense of some smaller play- ers. The polarisation of the industry between very large and very small, specialist com- panies - both in publishing and retailing - would almost certainly accelerate. The battle over the NBA is certain to make book publish- ing even more competitive. Some publishers suspect it will be too competitive. Mr Water- stone is one. He fears the industry is \"not strong enough to sustain\" a book price war. However, Mr Maher is con- vinced his campaign is not only unstoppable, but in the long-term interest of the indus- try. The end of the NBA would help it to sell more books, just as Dillons did this weekend with Winnie the Pooh. , UK SALES OF BOOKS DISTRIBUTION MARKET WH Smith Pentos Â£85m Independent booksellers .. . . ..",

   "text_content" : "US planners offer answer on traffic From Mr Angus Dalgleish Sir, The letter from Mr Alvarez-Moro (September 26) highlights the apparent help- lessness of European traffic authorities when trying to introduce simple, obvious mea- sures to give priority to high occupancy vehicles. In the US they have been developing techniques for more than 20 years and have little difficulty in enforcing them. One traffic lane into Manhattan carries three times as many seated passengers in an hour as does any rail track into central Lon- don. There are many other suc- cessful examples of lanes used by buses and car-pools. For transport planners in Europe, America might be on a different planet. They appear to know nothing or care noth- ing about what has been achieved there. Angus Dalgleish, Shouson Hill, Ruxbury Road, Chertsey KT16 9NH Canada, not UK, on the up From Nigel Wilkins Sir, Edward Balls (\"UK and Canada: similar problem, dif- ferent solution\", September 23) will have to look further afield than Canada to find a country whose government has mis- handled economic policy as badly as that of the UK. The most striking difference between the two economies is that the Canadian economic recovery began during the early summer, while in the UK we are still searching for faint murmurings among the under- growth. Whereas the output measure of GDP in the UK fell a further 0.9 per cent in the second quar- ter - leaving it 3.7 per cent below its level a year earlier - Canada's GDP bounced back with a rise of 12 per cent in the quarter, just 15 per cent below the previous year's fig- ure. Unemployment has already stabilised in Canada. In the UK, on the other hand, we have many months of grim news ahead of us. Nigel Wilkins, 8 Ptersham BousK. -Lomiv SW Hood Landaur SW7 3HID Accusation of racism 'Indulgence' of noinct iininn i 'ahniird Radio 3 and ridiculoi From Mr Ken Gill. Sir, Much nonsense has been written and spoken about our motion to this year's Trades Union Congress on inward investment. Your story, \"TUC seeks to soothe Japanese\" (September 21), among other things refers to a statement by Mr Edmund Dell, the former Labour trade secretary. He described the TUC resolution as \"absurd, ridiculous and damaging\". Is it so absurd, ridiculous or damaging to campaign for Brit- ish industry to be, by and large, controlled by British people? The report also referred to Gavin Laird's accu- sation of racism against MSS. This is \"absurd and ridicu- lous\", but fortunately not \"damaging\". Practices which are contrary to the traditional British arrangements are properly described as alien. They would be alien whether introduced by Japanese or British companies. Those who insist on describing this use of language as racist are either illiterate or are being mischievous. The issue of substance con- cerns the strategic approach of giant Japanese companies to industrial relations. There is no question that these compa- nies are trying to undermine trade union strength and that their insistence on company unions and no strike deals has seriously divided the British trade union movement. It is certainly alien to the letter and spirit of the ILO conventions that the employer and not the workforce chooses the employ- ees' union! It is the responsibility of trade union leadership to pro- tect best international practice and prevent giant transna- tional corporations from tram- pling over fundamental demo- cratic rights. That is all the TUC resolu- tion seeks to do. I am pleased that 85 per cent of congress saw it this way. Even as an employers' man, Mr Dell should understand these issues. Ken Gill, MSS general secretary, Park House, 64-66 Wandsworth Common, North Side London SW18 2SH Â·kb~r~~~U~ HIIIVII IV ~VVHIW From Mr D Anot Shepherd Sir, The Dutch presidency of the EC is proposing to give the European parliament greater legislative powers. Surely, before we go down this line the whole basis of representation through MEPs in the European parliament must be fundamen- tally altered. Britain has been a great exponent of democracy world- wide, based on one man one vote, yet here we are in Europe on an entirely false basis of representation. At the last European parlia- mentary election i noted that the average constituency per MEP in the UK, France and Germany was about one mem- bar for 70000 oters In the smaller countries such as Bel- Fax service I EM dnml -to n m d n md I NwM. gium and the Republic of Ireland it is about one member for 300,00(M00,000 and in the case of Luxembourg each MEP represents fewer than 100,000 voters. The outcome of this is that voters in Luxembourg have 10 times the amount of political clout as voters in the UK so far as MEP representation is con- cerned. It would be ludicrous to build more political control into such a thoroughly unbal- anced parlimentary reprcsn- tation. The structure, as it is, is unworthy ofirter potcal ni ane I ai apect NMPs themselves, as demo- crats, to be among the firt to reognise the meed far funda- m l change in the consttl- tion of their own body. D AroAt gheperd, Dmd WDD lXA Representation too unbalanced for more EC political control From Ian Simons Sir, The report on Lord Young's speech to the Royal Television Society (September 23) warrants serious attention. You quote him saying: \"Radio 3 is an indulgence that should be abolished.\" Lord Young, in firing his salvo in anticipation, assumingly, of the renegotiation of the BBC Charter, raises major issues on quality, cultural standards and the existence of one of the world's finest public radio sta- tions. The reduction of the colour television licence fee reported as the argument for the aboli- tion of the \"indulgence\" is hopefully not a view of those currently in office. Ian Simons, 6 Holland Par/; London W11 3TG Power report not doctored Prom Mr Andrew Barnett. Sir, You reported (September 20) the shadow minister of overseas development's view that my report on UK aid to six Large Power Generation Schemes was \"doctored\". I would like to make it clear that the changes that did occur between the first draft of Feb- ruary 1988, and the last, dated July 1990, were never the result of pressure from British business or from politicians. Indeed, all the comments from British business are included as a separate addendum to the final report. Ann Clwyd's com- ments are the first I have had from any politician! Despite the changes, the final report remains highly critical of these particular power projects. Readers of the report can be left in little doubt that the system for pro- viding concessional finance to the power sector needs consid- erable improvement - not least because there can be little future for companies if a signif- icant proportion of equipment they sell cannot be maintained and provides costly power to locations not in need of it. I take it from Ann Clwyd's press release that we can expect an avalanche of declas- sifted documents, come the next election! Andrew Barnett, 33 SighnBm AomuL Ir(it\" BNn 6a8"

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-30",
   "text_content" : "Samuel Brittan unemployed? This question drew me to the study of politi- cal economy. For a long time I wrongly believed that Keynes had solved the problem. The most important research into this topic in the last decade has been that under- taken by Richard Layard's Centre for Labour Market Eco- nomics. Its very title suggests a necessary change of empha- sis from Keynes's own absorp- tion in financial issues. The centre is now being expanded into a Centre for Economic Performance. This is, there- fore, a good time for a compre- hensive account of its findings. Why has unemployment increased so much since the late 1960s, and why by far more in the European Community than in Efta countries? Market economists say that unions or government regula- tion price workers out of jobs. How can this be? Cannot employers offset the effects of higher nominal pay by raising prices and restoring their origi- nal mark-up? They can try; but this will leave wage earners feeling cheated and coming back for more. Unemployment has to be high enough to mod- erate wage earners' real expec- tations and thus to prevent a wage price spiral from gather- ing force. High unemployment will thus often reflect the attempt to obtain excessive real wages rather than high real wages themselves. The authors call the process \"wage pres- sure\" and their explanation of it is a notable contribution to macroeconomics. What accounts for wage pressure? It is all too easy to explain in western Europe where union power and official policies increase the costs of hiring and firing. But how is it explained in the US, which is much less unionised? The authors have adopted the idea of \"efficiency wages\" as another source of wage pres- sure independent of unions and government. This some- Why is it that when there are so many unsatisfied wants, people who would like to work to supply these wants are what misleading expression describes the well-known desire of employers to pay more than the bare minimum, to retain and motivate a high- quality labour force. As a description of how business- men think, the idea is obvious. But I find it unconvincing at an economy-wide level. Whatever the reasons for wage pressure, there is a mini- mum level of unemployment required to prevent wages and prices chasing each other upwards indefinitely. This will be familiar to my readers as the NAIRU - the non-acclerat- ing inflation rate of unemploy- ment. Layard sometimes call it \"equilibrium unemployment\". It is the stage to which the system will return when both boom and slump are behind us. It is the analogue in the labour market of what I called normal capacity operation in Thurs- day's Economic Viewpoint. The authors find that unem- ployment will be higher, the High unemployment often reflects the attempt to obtain excessive real wages longer benefit lasts and the higher its ratio to pay. It will also be higher the greater its union strength. So far, so Thatcherite. One more Fabian finding is that labour market policies such as training, counselling and last resort public works jobs do keep unemployment down. Another is that union strength can be more than off- set by what the authors call corporatism - central co-ordi- nation of pay bargaining. Co- ordination by employers is, however, shown to be three times as important as co-ordi- nation by unions. Sweden still emerges as the model country. The main reasons given for the large increase in the Brit- ish equilibrium unemployment rate relate to distant happen- ings, such as worsening terms of trade, increased union influ- ence and more generous bene- fits, all of which came to an end by the early 1980s. The only up-to-date identified adverse influence is the increase in skill shortages in any given condition of the labour market. The authors freely admit that they have not provided a satisfactory explanation, given recent developments such as the reduction of union influ- ence and the much stricter benefit regime. One possibility, left open by the authors, is that equilibrium unemploy- ment has indeed been reduced and that once inflation has been stabilised at a level appro- priate to the ERM unemploy- ment will fall surprisingly in the 1990s. Layard's own view is that the Thatcherite labour market reforms have been offset by an unfortunate move to decentral- ise pay bargaining which should not have been any part of them. I can see that a highly centralised bargaining system, such as Sweden's or Austria's, is better placed to take into account economy-wide effects than British-style collective bargaining. But why should a move from industry or compa- ny-wide negotiations, to one which takes into account local labour market conditions, be harmful, once the transitional costs are out of the way? So far I have tried not to comment on the predilection of this book for centralisation and governmental reforms rather than deregulation with weaker unions. But I am afraid that it does affect the diagnosis as well as the policy recommenda- tions. Readers, however grate- ful for the mass of work in one volume, will have to make their own allowances. *Unemployment: Macroeco- nomic performance and the Labour Market, R Layard, S Nickell and R Jackman, Oxford, Â£1695.

   "text_content" : "By Julian Ozanne in Kinshasa ZAIRE'S president Mobutu Sese Seko and 11 pro-democ- racy opposition parties agreed last night to form a transi- tional government of national unity. The negotiations were con- cluded after nine hours of talks and followed last week's riots and looting which brought the country to the brink of chaos. The president yesterday sacked General Manzembe Banga as army chief of staff and replaced him with Gen Mahele Liyeko. Gen Liyeko is charged with restructuring and restoring discipline to the 40,000 strong army, elements of which muti- nied last Monday over a pay dispute. Their action sparked 48 hours of unrest which left at least 100 dead and devasted the capital, Kinshasa, and several provincial towns. The new government will be led by Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, the veteran leader of the oppo- sition Union for Democracy and Social Progress. The gov- ernment will have to be rati- fied by a reconvened national conference tomorrow. Many Zairean political observers believe that with the formation of a new govern- ment led by the opposition, Mr Mobutu has no option but to concede the absolute power he has wielded for 26 years. \"The violence last week has finished Mr Mobutu,\" said Mr Tshisekedi in an interview yes- terday. \"Everybody, even the army, wants change. He is still a dangerous monster, but he is a weakened one. He has no choice but to give up power. \"Mobutu may not accept that his rule is over but, with the pressure of the people, we will impose the reality on him,\" Mr Tshisekedi said. \"As prime minister I don't intend to consult with him or have anything to do with him. I will consult the people.\" But the transitional agree- ment, which will leave Mr Mobutu as president until elec- tions can be organised, could yet break down amid renewed conflict. The chances of the new gov- ernment succeeding will depend on how much power Mr Mobutu surrenders, particu- larly over the army and secu- rity forces. A crowd of more than 100, chanting that they were being sold out by the opposition lead- ers, yesterday forced Mr Mob- utu's convoy to stop just inside the gates of the palace. Mr Mobutu then held an impromptu audience with the demonstrators. Many claimed to represent the youth of the country and the true opposi- tion and were anxious about a government being carved up without their input. Several were invited by the president to join the meeting to discuss the new government. In spite of fears that Mr Mob- utu's newfound enthusiasm for co-operation may be a delaying tactic, opposition leaders are optimistic that they will be able to rule freely and prepare the way for the president's exit. Last night the Belgian defence ministry said Zaire had agreed to admit a further 200 Belgian troops to help evacuate citizens. There are already 1,600 Belgian and French troops in the country.

   "text_content" : "By David Owen and Paul Betts BRITISH AEROSPACE has been holding talks with Deut- sche Aerospace and Adrospat- iale of France over additional collaboration in the civil air- craft field. The talks, disclosed last night by a top union official, would include the possibility of creating a new European con- sortium for regional jets and commuter aircraft. Mr Roger Lyons, general sec- retary-designate of the MSS manufacturing union, said at the Labour party conference in Brighton that talks with both companies had taken place \"in recent weeks\". \"We .believe they are discussing joint sub- sidiaries which may take part of BAe's UK activities into an aerospace consortium,\" he said. \"We are alarmed that it is being done so secretly and that plants and communities are being carved-up in secret.\" He said BAe was also talking to other companies \"but these are the principal ones\". It is believed that the negoti- ations could be an attempt to reproduce at the bottom end of the market what Airbus is at the top end. There has been growing interest among Euro- pean aircraft manufacturers over forming a new European consortium to market aircraft of 100 seats and less. This would be along the lines of the Airbus consortium in which BAe, Deutsche Aero- space, Adrospatiale and Casa of Spain have collaborated for the past 20 years on aircraft of 150 seats and over. BAe confirmed last night that it had been in touch with the French and German com- panies, but said there was \"nothing substantive to report\". It added: \"We are all talking to each other all the time on a number of projects, including a possible successor to Concorde. On other projects we are poten- tially in competition with them.\" The company referred to a statement in its recent rights issue prospectus to the effect that it would not embark on a new commercial aircraft proj- ect without \"a substantial\" risk-sharing partner. About a year ago BAe and Deutsche Aerospace discussed regional jetliner co-operation but the talks broke down.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens und John Authors THE Conservatives signalled yesterday that Mr John Major is ready to commit the party to substantial reductions in inheritance tax during the next general election campaign. Senior party figures said the prime minister had given per- sonal backing to plans to raise significantly the present Â£140,000 threshold over which tax is paid. He may also con- sider a reduction in the 40 per cent rate at which it is levied. Despite Treasury objections to a firm commitment which might push the Conservatives into eventual abolition of the tax, the party is expected to include a pledge to reduce it in its election manifesto. Mr Major is said to believe that such a promise would form a central ingredient in the Conservatives' pledge to move away from what Mr Chris Patten, the party chair- man, referred to last week as a \"one generation society\". The manifesto will promise that a future government under Mr Major would entrench the ownership or wealth and allow its transfer from generation to generation. The political appeal of reducing inheritance tax comes from the fact that the threshold - though raised from Â£128,000 in the last Bud- get - does not take intc account the sharp rise in house prices of the past decade. That left many in the middle classes liable to a tax originally intended for the rich. Ministers believe that a pledge to reduce the tax, which raises about Â£lbn a year, would help sharpen the contrast on tax between the Conservatives and Labour. The current inheritance tax regime is already lenient for those who know how to take advantage of the exemptions. One accountant has called it a \"voluntary tax\", but few peo- ple take advantage of the opportunities to avoid paying A MORI survey earlier this year found that 62 per cent of people aged between 50 and 64 had done nothing to plan for the tax. This suggests that the advantages of the current regime go mainly to those wealthy enough to pay for advice. Reform could make it simpler for the new generation of homeowners, only recently liable to inheritance tax, to avoid paying. It could have a more serious Impact on the financial ser- vices industry. Mintel, th- market research company, found that Â£8.1bn passed directly from one generation to another in 1990-91. It pro- jects that this will rise to Â£13bn by the year 2000."

   "text_content" : "THE polls are now forcing the government to put its hopes where its convictions can hardly be: in economic fore- casts. Forecasts have been unreliable; but the Treasury seems to get more confident with every disappointment. Since model-builders hate to scrap their handiwork,. their obstinacy is understandable in human terms. However, the ministers who choose to believe are showing more faith than reason. The UK recovery is supposed to be consumer-led; but if you talk to those who depend on consumer demand for business rather than for votes, you will not hear of recovery. The mass market trades hope for some Christmas revival, but see no sign of it yet; the luxury trades are in worse shape. Exports, then? The boom in car exports, mainly to Germany, which has produced the illusion of dynamic growth is already fad- ing. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe is slowing down. Indus- trial investment? Don't be silly. If you can't find evidence, fall back on cliches. The opti- mists tell us that recovery is never visible until after it has happened, that the continued rise in bankruptcies and sack- ings is normal in the early stages of a recovery; this is all I would much prefer a brief to describe the UK economy to the Labour get-together than to try to provide support for Conserva- tive wishful thinking perfectly true, but these things also happen when there isn't a recovery. The darkest hour may be just before the dawn, but it is dark at night, too. Alternatively, we are told that the turnround in confi- dence shows that the faith of the forecasters is widely shared. This would be impres- sive if it were true; but if you look at the surveys closely, you will see that they are con- cerned with short-term devel- opments. They compare the next short period with the cur- rent one. All that they really say, then, is that industry no longer expects things to get even worse than they are now, which is something short of a trumpet call. It is, pretty much what the pessimists are saying. The pessimists could still be proved wrong; there is no such thing as a reliable forecast. A recovery is possible, but don't bet on it. At the moment, I would much prefer a brief to describe the UK economy to the Labour By Anthony Harris party get-together this week than to try to provide support for Conservative wishful think- ing. It is interesting to contrast the UK government's state- ments with those of the US authorities. Official forecasts by both are rose-tinted; but President Bush, who has few worries about re-election, takes them with a large pinch of salt. The evidence for some sort of recovery in the US is stron- ger than in the UK. It is hesi- tant and disappointing, but export growth at least is broadly based and long sus- tained. But the authorities do not thump their chests. The Fed goes on reporting weak activity and cutting interest rates, benignly neglecting the exchange rate. The White House wants more and com- plains that the prudential squeeze on bank credit, hardly mentioned in London any more, is inhibiting recovery. Investors seem to prefer frank grumbling to obvious propaganda: it is the Americans who are voting for recovery. Even after the bull run this year, British price/ earnings ratios are only a point or so above their 1980s aver- ages, and nearly a third below their peak in 1987. The Stan- dard and Poor's industrials, on the other hand, look somewhat exposed, over 21 and less than three points below the specula- tive peak in 1987. (This sug- gests that a UK investor might prefer to hold his stake in US prospects through a British company.) The bond market provides an under-pinning for both mar- kets. The US yield ratio, at just over 2.6, is well within its nor- mal range and miles below its exposed peak of nearly 3.6, four years ago. In Britain, the mul- tiple is only just over 2, com- pared with a peak almost as high as Wall Street. This seems to reinforce the case for Lon- don, but only only up to a point. It reflects the fact that British interest rates cannot in the foreseeable future fall as low as those now in prospect in the US. Again, the real moral is that London is an attractive route to the outside world rather than to the constrained UK economy. A consideration of earnings makes one a good deal queas-- ier about the domestic outlook. The current p/e ratio may look reasonable historically; but what is the quality of the earn- ings? In too many companies they seem to bear more evi- dence of creative accounting than of performance. The current fashion for white collar redundancies rep- resents not only economy but a cut in provision for the future. So do some economies which cannot be read from the accounts but only from the results of service industries - for example, the poor current results of specialists in toxic waste disposal. That has a nasty message for the future. There is a real danger that institutional pressure for ever- rising dividends is making equities more risky, not less. Some companies will be able to reveal and absorb their cur- rently hidden costs when times improve, resulting only in dis- appointment about profits growth. Others - every ana- Others are doing what is euphemistically called \"managing for a takeover\". This is a hollowing-out process, a kind of slow-motion voluntary liquidation lyst has his own little list - are doing what is euphemisti- cally called \"managing for a takeover\". This is a hollowing- out process, a kind of slow-mo- tion voluntary liquidation. Core capital is distributed as dividends; the nasty surprises are left for the unwary bidder. There is also a political rea- son for playing it short. As long as there is a realistic pos- sibility of a Labour govern- ment, there is also a possibility of a very sharp rise in capital gains tax. This provides a strong motive for successful entrepreneurs to realise their gains sooner rather than later. This is possibly just a matter of bed and breakfast - but not everyone can be relied on to appear for breakfast. Either way, it is the short term share price which matters. Deplorable, you may think; but if any company managers are behaving like this, they can claim a political model. What are the toxic wastes hid- den in the public accounts?",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-30",
   "text_content" : "THE FIRST anniversary of Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem falls at the end of this week just as the annual public expenditure round enters its final difficult month. At first, there appears no special reason to link the two events. But recent research by the ESRC Macroeconomic Mod- elling Bureau at Warwick Uni- versity and by Mr David Smith, chief economist of City of Lon- don stockbrokers Williams de Broi, suggests otherwise. They argue that public expenditure, like so many other aspects of UK economic life, has to adapt to the fixed exchange-rate regime of ERM membership. According to Mr Smith, both the government - and the Labour party if it comes to power - will find that increases in public expen- diture will damage economic growth in general, and private sector output in particular, so long as sterling is pegged. The reasoning is contained in a paper by the Warwick team published last month in the Economic Review of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a comparative analysis of the econometric models of the Treasury, the Bank of England and Oxford Economic Forecast- ing, the Warwick researchers concluded that increased pub- lic expenditure would, within three or four years, have an overall negative effect on UK output as measured by gross domestic product. They said maintaining the value of sterling would require increases in short-term interest rates, which would \"crowd out\" growth elsewhere in the economy. Moreover, the War- wick team said the manufac- taring sector would suffer a disproportionate fall in output. Mr Smith took the Warwick findings and calculated the impact of a Â£2bn-a-year rise in public expenditure at 1990 prices on economic growth. The Treasury model suggested gross domestic product would be depressed by Â£1.7bn in the fifth year while Â£3.7bn of pri- vate output would be crowded out by the fifth year. The Bank of England model pointed to even greater nega- tive effects. It suggested that the Â£2bn-a-year increase in public spending would depress GDP by Â£5.3bn and private out- put by Â£7.3bn in year five. Such output loss would mean higher unemployment. On the strength of these cal- culations, Mr Smith concluded that \"the victors in the forth- coming election would be well advised to instigate severe pub- lic expenditure cut-backs immediately afterwards to maximise their chance of being returned to office in the late 1990s.\" It is expected that the Trea- sury will have to add at least Â£5bn to its Â£221bn public expenditure planning total for the coming 1992-93 financial year. If maintained, such expendi- ture growth could have more serious crowding-out effects than suggested by the simula- tions of Warwick University and Mr Smith. But models of an economy are not the same as the real thing. They are fallible and, in the case of public spending, do not distinguish between worth- while public expenditure, such as investment on infrastruc- ture which should enhance the supply side of the economy, and less productive or unprod- uctive spending. Moreover, econometric mod- els are like cars - they are constantly being redesigned. Those used by the Warwick team were the 1980 veruious. The Bank of England model, for example, has since been revised in one important respect. The models in the Warwick simulation had a backwards- looking exchange rate equa- tion. Their view of sterling's future trends was based largely on the experience of the pound's behaviour in pre-ERM days when governments were frequently forced to defend sterling with sharp interest rate increases. The Bank model now has a forward-looking exchange rate equation which, like the sinan- cial markets, takes more account of expectations. This change has had a significant impact on the interest rate assumptions which, in turn, largely determine output expectations. The forward-looking model suggests that interest rates are less likely to rise so sharply now that sterling is in the ERM and the government has made defeating inflation its highest economic priority. Accordingly, a table in the lat- est Bank of England model manual shows that higher pub- lic expenditure need have hardly any effect on output over a five-year period. The experience so far this year of falling interest rates while public expenditure has been growing quite rapidly tends to support this view. But the validity of such for- ward-looking exchange rate equations depends crucially on govement polcies retmadng their credibility with financial markets. This alone should give Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary, some pause for thought as he haggles to keep down departmental budgets. The model-making exercises have rather more worrying implications for the Labour party. It is committed to a sub- stantial increase in public spending if it wins power at the next general election, and must also reckon on scepticism in financial markets about its ability to control inflation. Trinidad Terms Crowding out of a different kind seems to be threatening one of the prime minister's pet initiatives in the international financial arena. At the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting a year ago, Mr John Major, when chancellor of the exchequer, unveiled a plan to cut the offi- cial debt burden of the poorest developing countries by two thirds. He hoped this year's economic summit in London in July would adopt and launch the plan, which is urgently needed in Africa. Instead, the G7 summit referred the matter to the Paris club of western creditor nations. The Paris club met this month and failed to agree the terms because of US opposi- tion. Japan, which also opposed the terms at the sum- mit, has since softened its posi- tion. To some extent the Trinidad Terms are being crowded out of the international financial agenda by the problems of the Soviet Union. But the US administration faces difficul- ties over how to deal with debt write-offs in its budget process and is uncertain whether it can win support for the plan from a hostfle Cogr ss Mr MaJor has raised the mat- ter twice with President Bush in recent months. But the main repoosibOlity for pushing the pln now falls on Mr Norman Laonat, the present Chancel- lor, when he attends the annal meeilngs of the Inter- national Monetary Fund and World Bank in Bangkok next __i _ti Economics Notebook By Peter Norman"

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn MOVES are under way to create a world-ranking financial ser- vices group based in Berlin which may involve Britain's Bar- clays Bank and Crddit Lyonnais of France as significant share- holders. State officials are preparing draft legislation to merge the city's majority stakes in the Ber- liner Bank, the Landesbank Ber- lin, Wohnungsbau-Kreditanstalt Berlin and the mortgage group Berliner Pfandbrief-Bank under the umbrella of a new company, Berliner Banken Holding (BBH). It is expected to be discussed in the state parliament next month, according to Der Spiegel, the Ger- man weekly news magazine. With a business volume of more than DM120bn (Â£40.8bn) BBH would become the sixth largest commercial bank in Ger- many. In terms of shareholder equity its DM5.2bn would make it fourth-equal with Bayerische Vereinsbank and Hypobank. Credit business, according to Der Spiegel, could reach DM36bn. The magazine said the city would retain a majority stake in the new company and 25 per cent would be held by the Gothaer Versicherung insurance group linked via cross shareholdings to the Berliner Bank. About 15 per cent would be placed in the stock market, and negotiations were under way for the balance to be taken up by Barclays and Crddit Lyonnais. Quoting from documents pre- pared by Berliner Bank and Lan- desbank Berlin, the magazine said the merger should \"enable the Berlin financial services industry to play a more authori- tative role in the new states of east Germany, the development of east European markets and in the European Community\". Berliner Bank, which last year reported a 16 per cent earnings rise in the wake of rapid expan- sion in the east, has already swal- lowed up the former eastern Ber- liner Stadtbank, and has been waiting for months for permis- sion from the state authorities to merge with Landesbank Berlin. Credit Lyonnais is believed to be keen to reinforce German links to ease access to the east.

   "text_content" : "ohn Sculley opens his brief- case like a conjurer about to produce a rabbit from a hat. Inside is a laminated security badge giving the Apple Computer chairman and chief executive temporary employee status at International Business Machine's Austin, Texas, facilities. \"This is my souvenir,\" grins Mr Sculley. \"This is where we were all summer and nobody knew about it.\" Mr Sculley's mission was to forge an alliance with Apple's biggest and most bitter rival, a move that could radically alter the course of the $90bn personal computer business in the 1990s. IBM and Apple will announce the final terms and details of their collaboration later this week. The companies have agreed to broad co-operation in the development of a new genera- tion of PC technology. A joint venture to develop new PC sys- tem software that defines the basic functions of a computer. Mr Scully acknowledges that \"a few years ago it would have been unthinkable\" for Apple and IBM to become partners. How- ever, much has changed since 1984 when Apple spent a million dollars on a TV commercial that characterised Big Blue as Big Brother. Today, IBM and Apple face common challenges. Both are struggling to commercialise tech- nology faster, and both are attempting to revitalise their cor- porate strategies. During the 1980s, Mr Sculley says, Apple was \"a niche player in a high-growth segment of the computer industry\". In the 1990s, he aims to \"bring Apple into the mainstream\" of corporate com- puting. The IBM alliance has become the cornerstone of Mr Sculley's new \"agenda\", involving some radical changes at Apple. The company will abandon the propri- etary software strategy used for the past decade to differentiate its products from those of other PC makers in favour of \"open\" software licensing. \"At Apple this is like walking into the Vatican and renouncing Catholicism,\" Mr Sculley says. He acknowledges that Apple will have to compete with IBM and other PC makers on price and faster delivery of products, and by offering more attractive \"solutions\" to users' needs. The prospect of going head to head with the world's biggest computer manufacturer and with both companies offering similar products does not worry Mr Scul- ley. \"I spent most of my life com- Louise Kehoe talks to Apple's John Sculley on the eve of the alliance with IBM peting like that,\" says the former president of Pepsi-Cola, where he spearheaded a marketing battle with Coca-Cola before joining Apple eight years ago. Before approaching IBM a year ago to suggest a technology development alliance, Mr Sculley and Mr Michael Spindler, Apple president, spent months with their counterparts in the world computer and electronics indus- tries exploring grounds for co-operation. The search for partners was prompted by Mr Sculley's realisa- tion that \"Apple would be irrele- vant in the 1990s\" unless he made drastic changes and that the com- pany \"could not do it all alone\". In stark contrast to his enthu- siasm today for the future of Apple, Mr .Sculley admits to past doubts. \"Two years ago, I felt that Apple was not going to be a company that shaped the indus- try in the 1990s, in the way it had throughout the 1980s,\" he says. New product introductions had been delayed and Apple was los- ing market share to competitors. It was also evident that Micro- soft's Windows 3.0, a program providing IBM-compatible com- puters with many Apple Macin- tosh features, would weaken Apple's competitive position. Mr Sculley set about putting Apple on a new track beginning with top management changes including the stormy departure of Mr Jean Louis Gassde, and the appointment of Mr Spindler, for- merly Apple's top European exec- utive, as chief operating officer, and later president, of Apple. With Mr Spindler looking after day-to-day operations, Mr Sculley took charge of Apple's technol- ogy development in an effort to speed new products to market. Apple launched lower-priced Macintosh products last October in a bid to increase the compa- ny's market share. This strategy has increased Apple's sales vol- ume, but lower prices led to reduced profit margins forcing cost-cutting including layoffs. Next month, Apple will launch notebook computers and a high- performance desktop version of the Macintosh. \"We will have caught up in the market seg- ments where we have been behind,\" Mr Sculley says. Mr Sculley has been developing Apple's product strategy for the 1990s when he expects the PC's role will be redefined. He sees the PC industry split- ting into two groups; one driven by open \"enterprise systems\", the other by miniaturisation and mobility. In corporate computing, the PC is becoming vital in company- wide multi-vendor computer net- works. Miniaturisation, however, is transforming the PC into a por- table personal communications and computing tool. With appro- priate applications software, it could create a consumer electron- ics boom. Apple plans product lines for both these segments. The alli- ance with IBM will help Apple to create a line of PCs for the corpo- rate market. Apple will also con- tinue to build on its Macintosh product line \"throughout the rest of the decade\", Mr Sculley says. On the consumer side, \"we can play a big role because we know how to make technology easy to use,\" says Mr Sculley. He enthuses about the potential of the miniaturised PC as a \"per- sonal communications\" device.

   "article_dc_title" : "Small Uk Investors to Be Offered Bt Stake Worth Â£2.5bn",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By John Authers SMALL investors in the UK will be offered around Â£2.5bn worth of shares in BT, formerly British Telecom, when the UK govern- ment sells part of its remaining 49 per cent stake later this year. The portion for retail investors will be half the total stake on sale, with the other half offered by auction to UK investment institutions and international investors. According to the latest planning assumptions, the gov- ernment will sell half of its shares in the company. The auction will break with the system used for all previous flotations of government-owned stock by not guaranteeing UK institutions a specific percentage of shares. With no fixed ratios it is theoretically possible for al Â£2.5bn to be sold to institutiae outside the UK. However, this is unlikely as British firms win need to maintain some weightiag in BT. Advisers to the issue said War- burg, a house not previously closely associated with govern- ment share flotations, had been chosen as lead manager because of its global expertise. Goldman Sachs, of the US, and Daiwa, of Japan, act as regional managers, and are also involved in assess- ing institutional demand. The new system adapted expe- rience from the US, and took note of the tender for stock in the electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, earlier this year. Government advisers say the new system should maximise proceeds by assessing institu- tional demand on a \"level playing field\"; avoid an extreme leap in price immediately after the shares start trading on the stock market; and shorten the official launch period as demand will be established in advance. It should also act as a \"com- fort\" to small shareholders in the UK as the price they pay will be set at a discount to the going rate for institutional buyers. It was thought necessary to offer a discount to ensure the sale's success in the UK. British consumers might not have been happy paying more than large firms. By expressing the dis- count in relation to the prevail- ing market price, the flotation should be less vulnerable to sud- den swings in stock prices. The \"Black Monday\" crash of Octo- ber 1987, for example, damaged the flotation of the government's remaining stake in BP. The formula that determines the discount will not be announced until tomorrow when the flotation will be formally launched to retail investors.",

   "text_content" : "TAKING INTO account discontinued businesses, Asso- ciated Nursing Services, the USM-quoted healthcare group, turned down from a Â£1.86m profit to a Â£2.07m loss in the year ended March 30 1991. Turnover increased to 16.6m (Â£11.lm), while losses per share were 37.9p (earnings 34.7p). There is no final dividend leav- ing the total at Ip (3p). This year's loss comprised continuing profit Â£486,000 after exceptional charges Â£172,000, and discontinued loss Â£2.55m including exceptionals Â£132,000. The 1989-90 figures were boosted by Â£1.34m from the sale of two nursing homes. Below-the-line charges of Â£1.87m related to the cessation of operations at Weston and Ross, Sensa Design and Mar- keting, Topak Healthcare, and at the 19 per cent owned Vac- ances Elite. William Jacks goes further into loss With the recession in motor vehicle retailing especially pro- nounced at the top end of the market, William Jacks saw its pre-tax loss for the half year ended July 31 1991 increased from Â£21,000 to Â£601,000. The group sells Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW, Saab and Rover cars. Turnover fell to Â£21.2m (Â£23.3m). Unit sales of new and used cars were further reduced from last year, and margins contracted. Losses per share came to 5.56p (0.2p). BET head surprised by departure reports Mr Nicholas Wills, chairman of industrial services group BET, said yesterday that reports of his imminent departure had taken him by surprise and he believed they were \"unfounded Lucre on muLVnuy IUuILruI Mr Wills, just arrived back from a trip to the US, said \"Yes, I'll be there on Monday morning,\" but declined to com- ment further. A spokesman said it was the company's pol- icy not to comment on rumours. Reports yesterday morning suggested that Mr Wills and two other senior directors would leave the group soon as part of a strategic review by the company's new chief exec- utive Mr John Clark. The 90-day review, ending this week, \"is intended to establish the right mix of busi- nesses and right level of cash generation,\" according to the company. Mr Clark replaced Mr Wills as chief executive in April fol- lowing City criticism of the group's trading performance. Goodwin benefits from efficiency On marginally lower turnover, Goodwin lifted its pre-tax profit by over 8 per cent in the year ended April 30 1991, from Â£416,000 to Â£451,000. The higher profit was achieved by production effi- ciency coupled with new plant installations. Current order book was deteriorating, but in anticipation of an increased market share the dividend is being raised to 0.63p (0.6p). The group, which operates as a mechanical and refractory engineer and metal processor, produced turnover of Â£14.19m (Â£14.2m). Earnings per share were up Ip to 4.6p. F&C Pacific net assets increase Over the six months ended July 31 1991 net asset value of F&C Pacific Investment Trust rose from 177.1p to 228.3p. A year earlier it was 217.7p. Earnings per share were 1.34p (1.25p) from gross reve- nue of Â£3.28m (Â£3.15m). The interim dividend is raised to 0.75p (0.55p) to reduce dispar- ity; the final was expected to be held at Ip. SI Group selling shares to workers The 319 employees and 690 self-employed associates of SI Group, a privately held com- puting services concern, are being given the chance to buy shares in the company. Between 400,000 and 600,000 shares are on offer at Â£2.70 each, and if the maximum is sold the company will be capi- talised at Â£6.2m. Minimum sub- scription by a member of the workforce will be for 50 shares with a value of Â£135. The notional gross dividend yield is 7.4 per cent. SI is unusual because it is staffed by computer program- mers and systems analysts who work chiefly from home. Â£10m offer for DC Gardner divisions DC Gardner, a financial train- ing and consulting concern, said it had received a Â£10m unsolicited conditional offer from Capefield for its banking training and outplacement divisions. The board will meet early this week to consider the offer, it said.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox PLANS FOR the demerger of Maxwell Communication Cor- poration need to progress by the end of the year, or terms for the repayment of the group's debt might have to be renegotiated early in 1992, according to observers of the company in London. There is also growing scepti- cism among US investors about the success of a flotation of Macmillan and Official Air- lines Guide, the largest of the group's US businesses. \"The Max Factor has crossed the Atlantic and a flotation is scarcely an option at the moment\", according to promi- nent Wall Street investors. Several US institutions, who declined to be named, have said that the falls in the share price of Mirror Group Newspa- pers, Mr Robert Maxwell's sec- ond listed publishing company, from its May flotation of 125p to its present 90p had taken away US appetite for the stock. \"We took a bath on the Mir- ror\" said one fund manager, who added that the impact on quarterly performance tables, rather than the BBC investiga- tion last week or the subse- quent press comment, was responsible for their present lack of enthusiasm. Earlier this month at the AGM of MCC, Mr Maxwell repeated his intention to demerge the US businesses, 90 per cent of the group's operat- ing profit, \"in order to increase shareholder value\". The move could also help reduce the group's debt, now believed to be $1.35bn. However one leading Boston- based media analyst said \"no way would MCC's US busi- nesses even get a premium to the US market, which is now trading on a multiple of 15-16 times 1993 earnings. Macmillan is mainly a book publisher, so it's not a great play on the upturn in advertising.\" A demerger by selling the businesses to another company is also an option being exam- ined, but US bankers have commented that a flotation would be much cleaner and quicker. However, Maxwell observers have commented that August meetings of MCC's bankers assumed a demerger would go ahead and they would want an alternative plan quickly if that looked unlikely.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd PANFIDA, the heavily- borrowed retailing group, has announced a refinancing agreement with its three prin- cipal non-bank lenders which include Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International. The lenders will be given 132m shares at 25p in exchange for eliminating Pan- fida's Â£49m borrowings; pro- viding Â£5m by way of an inter- est-free five year loan facility; waiving future interest amounting to Â£llm and issu- ing a Â£5m five year convert ible non-interest bearing loan. Panfida's shares closed on Friday up '%p at 6p. Mr Peter Wenzel, deputy chairman of Panfida, said the refinancing would enable the group to concentrate its resources on the Martin news- agents chain, which made an operating profit of Â£5.2m, up from Â£949,000, for the half year to December. Overall, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Â£3.8m (Â£7.1m). Holders of the convertible notes issued in Australia three years ago will be offered one 25p share for each note which was worth A$1.30. A majority of note holders have indicated they will support the plan. Agreement has been reached with one of the lenders to TOC Retail, the US subsidiary, for the release of Panfida's $10m (Â£5.8m) liability in relation to TOC's indebtedness, in exchange for 12m shares at 25p. The refinancing is condi- tional on approval of share- holders, holders of the notes and the consent of various banks. Panfida's capital will be increased to around 260m shares. News International's stake will be reduced from 31 to 26 per cent. The other two big non-bank lenders, Elders Finance group and GFA International, become significant sharehold- ers for the first time, taking 23 and 13 per cent of the new shareholding.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox MOLINS, maker of specialised machinery for the tobacco industry, could know as early as this morning whether it has lost its 18-month battle for its independence against the US financial conglomerate Leuca- dia National Corp. It will today count proxies for tomorrow's EGM at Gla- zier's Hall in the City, where Leucadia, a 48.5 per cent share- holder, will try for a second time to gain board control by replacing three Molins direc- tors with six of its own. Institutions hold 50 per cent of Molins, and the support of the private shareholders, with 1.5 per cent, will be crucial. Shareholders last year rejected Leucadia's proposal to reshuffle directors after the failure of its May 1990 bid for the company. Molins has claimed that Leu- cadia is trying to gain control without making a full offer to shareholders at the current price of 351p. Should Leucadia be success- ful, Molins will be the third company in which it has bought a large minority stake and then won board control. In July Leucadia announced that it had been unable to agree terms for a merger with PHLCorp, the US trading stamps business in which it holds a 67 per cent stake. In February 1990 it finally took over Brae, the US rail car leas- ing company, five years after acquiring a 41 per cent stake and gaining board control. Even if Leucadia's proposals are rejected, it is still allowed to buy a further 2 per cent a year, which could give it a 50.5 per cent majority shareholding next August. At the EGM tomorrow Molins's own resolution will ask for shareholder permission to increase its capital by about 27 per cent at the manage- ment's discretion. If the com- pany found a suitable acquisi- tion for which shares were issued, it could dilute Leuca- dia's holding.",

Union Capital Partners said it had been told last week by Mr Michael Jordan, the lead administrator, that he did not intend to invite offers for Del Monte. The company, which has put together finance from a number of US investors, said Mr Jordan had been more wel- coming of its first approach six weeks ago. The refusal now came despite a possible increase in the bid, subject to being allowed access to Del Monte to complete due dili- gence work, Union said. * Last week the PPI adminis- trators sold a controlling inter- est in Sansui, the Far Eastern consumer electronics company, to Grande Holdings of Hong Kong.

   "text_content" : "By Haig Simonlan in Milan FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the financial holding concern controlling the Ferruz- zi-Montedison group of compa- nies, added to a bleak first-half reporting season for Italy's leading companies by announc- ing a slide in group consoli- dated profits after minority interests to L83bn ($66m) from L180bn last year. Sales rose slightly to L8,631bn from L8,352bn in the first six months of the year. Despite the profits fall, the group said it expected \"moder- ately positive results\" for the year as a whole. Ferfin said the current out- look for the dividend suggested the possibility of a payout \"substantially in line with the previous year\". The group attributed its prof- its decline in the first half to the difficulties at many of its subsidiaries, especially the Montecatini chemicals opera- tion, which has suffered from declining margins on many plastics products and from the tougher conditions facing the world chemicals industry. Ferfin implied that rational- isation at Montecatini would affect mainstream and white-collar jobs at many of its operating subsidiaries. Further cuts could come through the continuing reorganisation fol- lowing the decision last year to merge Montedison, which con- trols Montecatini, with the agro-industrial activities for- merly carried out by Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria. Net group indebtedness stood at L7,874bn, which was L1,107bn lower than at the same time last year. However, the figure was L1,209bn above that at end-December 1990. Ferfin ascribed the increase partly to changes in the dollar- lira exchange rate. Debt had also risen owing to the tradi- tional concentration of pay- ments in the first half of the year in the the agro-industrial business.",

   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan MUNICIPALITY Finance, the financing arm of Finland's local government sector, plans to make its debut in the Euro- bond market this week with an issue that may signal a new source of supply of Ecu-denom- inated paper. Following the linkage of sev- eral Scandinavian currencies to the Ecu this year, and given the high relative interest rates in all Scandinavian markets, borrowers from the region using the Ecu market are now able to benefit from lower interest rate payments with the virtual elimination of cur- rency exposure. Otherwise, the supply of paper in the Ecu bond market is likely to be lower than expected during the last quar- ter of 1991, in the wake of the European Bank for Reconstruc- tion and Development's highly successful Ecu500m deal last week. The Kingdom of Spain, which had been preparing to launch an Eculbn deal, has put its foreign borrowing on hold, while Belgium, which had also been eyeing the Ecu market, has raised funds in dollars instead. Municipality Finance plans to issue Ecu300m of five- or seven-year bonds. The deal, arranged by Goldman Sachs, will be swapped into floating-rate Ecu, and then lent in small portions to individual municipalities. The deal will be guaranteed by Local Government Pen- sions, an agency of the Repub- lic of Finland. Municipality Finance's long-term debt is rated triple-A by Standard & Poor's and double-Al by Moody's. The borrower plans to raise about Eculbn in 1992, in addition to domestic debt. Other Scandinavian borrow- ers are interested in the mar- ket. However, for the moment, none of the sovereign borrow- ers are in need of funds, and the Ecu market may not offer sufficient arbitrage for aggres- sive agencies like Swedish Export Credit.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney AUSTRALIA's Companies and Securities Committee, a key government advisory body, calls in a report published today for a significant tighten. ing of corporate disclosure leg- islation. The report follows a two- month investigation ordered by Mr Michael Duffy, the attor- ney general, as part of prepara- tion for a wide-ranging corpo- rate regulations Bill to be tabled in parliament early next year. The report supports the sys- tem of \"continuous disclosure\" introduced earlier this year by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), which requires listed companies to inform the mar- ket of any \"material informa- tion\". However, it says the continu- ous disclosure rules should be extended to private companies with gross assets of more than A$10m (US$8m), and to govern- ment-owned corporations such as Australia Telecom and Qantas. Unlisted companies would have to file detailed interim and annual reports with the Australian Securities Commis- sion (ASC), the corporate watchdog, and inform it of any transactions or events that could affect financial or opera- tional prospects. The report says an extension of quarterly reporting, which is currently limited to listed min- ing companies, should be kept under review, but was \"not warranted at this stage\". Mr Ian Ramsay, the commit- tee's deputy director, said con- tinuous reporting would make quarterly reporting unneces- sary. \"Once we have an effec- tively enforced continuous dis- closure regime up and running, the attractiveness of quarterly reporting diminishes rapidly,\" he said. The committee's recommen- dations are expected to be included in the forthcoming Bill, which will also incorpo- rate earlier recommendations on the law on directors' responsibilities and inter-com- pany financial transactions. Moves to tighten the law fol- low unease among investors over the activities of some companies and individuals dur- ing the late 1980s. Several businessmen are sac- ing criminal charges following ASC investigations, including Mr Alan Bond, former chair- man of Bond Corporation Hold- ings, and Mr Christopher Skase, former head of the Qin- ir media and leisure aroun.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters TWO of France's best-known financiers, Mr Pierre Moussa and Mr Gerard Eskenazi, have formed an alliance, rekindling their close association of a decade ago when they ran Paribas, the French banking group. The alignment will also result in Swiss Bank Corpora- tion becoming a minority holder in part of Mr Moussa's private investment and sinan- cial services group, Pallas. Mr Eskenazi is to take a 25 per cent stake in Pallas Hold- ings, which runs the group's financial services businesses, through his investment vehicle, Compagnie Indus- trielle a Paris. Pallas's invest- ments include the majority stake in Cresvale, a securities house. He will also take a 20 per cent stake in Pallas Invest, the investment holding company built up by Mr Moussa and Pal- las's president, Mr Peter Cas- tenfelt. At the same time, Pallas is to merge its small Paris-based merchant banking subsidiary, Banque Pallas France, with Banque Stern, a merchant bank acquired by SBC in 1988. The new bank, to be known as Banque Pallas Stem, will be majority-owned by Pallas, with SBC holding a 35 per cent stake. The new bank is also due to participate in a joint-venture corporate finance operation in France together with SBC and Mr Eskenazi's Comipar, said Mr Castenfelt. SBC is already a significant backer of Comipar, with a fifth of the shares. The series of links was intended to bring together the investment skills of Pallas and Mr Eskenazi, and enable Pallas to benefit from Mr Eskenazi's deal-making skills, said Mr Castenfelt. Comipar is buying mainly existing shares in Pal- las, rather than injecting new capital, though it has agreed to take over some of the group's investments, he said. Mr Eskenazi quit the board of Pargesa, the Swiss holding company, a year ago.",

The introduction today of a \"single chip personal com- puter\" by Chips & Technolo- gies, a leading Silicon Valley supplier of semiconductor components for personal com- puters, promises to drive the cost and size of personal com- puters down to calculator pro- portions. The device that could make this possible is the \"PC/Chip\", a semiconductor circuit con- taining all the electronic logic functions of a personal com- puter. It replaces half a dozen of the semiconductor chips used in today's most highly-in- tegrated personal computer designs. Add a keyboard, a dis- play, data storage peripherals and some memory chips and you have a complete personal computer system. Chips & Technologies' first PC/Chip provides the comput- ing power of an 8086 low-end desktop personal computer, such as an IBM XT-compatible. In about 18 months, the com- pany aims to Introduce a higher performance version equivalent to today's most popular \"386\" PC models. \"The first simple electronic calculators, in the early 1970s, cost about $500. Today, they sell for about $5 and people throw them away when the batteries run down,\" says Mr Gordon Campbell, Chips & Technologies chairman and chief executive. He sees the portable personal computer following a similar path in the 1990s. Total material costs will be about $100 (157.40), says Mr Campbell. That should trans- late into introductory retail prices as low as $250. Over the next few years the price could fall to well under $100. Chips & Technologies is to demonstrate its PC/Chip in a prototype \"pocket-sized\" per- sonal computer.",

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto DEALINGS in shares of Mrs Fields, the US-based cookie shop, have been suspended on London's unlisted securities market (USM). The move follows transac- tions between the company and its affiliates, which are owned by Mr Randall Fields and Mrs Debbi Fields, respec- tively chairman and chief executive officer. The shares have been suspended at 10p. At the height of its popularity, the one-time star of the USM rose to a peak of 266p in June 1987. Transactions at the centre of discussions with the stock exchange involve those between the company and its affiliates, mainly La Petite Boulangerie and Fields Soft- ware, both of which are pri- vately owned by the Fields. Some of the transactions appearing in the accounts were not known to sharehold- ers prior to their publication. The share suspension would allow the stock exchange to determine whether those transactions should have been reported to shareholders. According to the 1990 report and accounts, Mrs Fields and La Petite have licensing agree- ments to sell each others' products. Mrs Fields earned royalties of $310,000 and $661,000 in 1990 and 1989 and paid La Petite an advance non- refundable royalty of $5m. A further maximum $3m may be owed to La Petite. Mrs Fields and Fields Soft- ware also have computer soft- ware licensing agreements between them. However, the group stressed that the suspension did not relate to the trading situation or the finances of Mr Fields. The financially-stretched group, which is primarily a US business but is listed only in London, has faced a difficult environment and reported a pre-tax loss of $8.79m last yearW.",

   "text_content" : "THE Italian government bond market staged a strong rally in September, again defying the negative pull of political and economic uncertainty. Firstly, the country appeared to be heading for another period of political upheaval, with Mr Guilio Andreotti's gov- ernment nearly brought down last week by divisions over a 1992 budget package. In addition, the OECD's annual survey of the Italian economy carried the stern warning that high inflation and unemployment and a stub- bornly high budget deficit left it dangerously out of step with its main trading partners. The consequences of not coming to grips with such intractable problems were underlined by the Dutch pro- posals on European monetary union, unveiled earlier in the month. This envisages a two- speed approach, with high-in- flation economies being excluded from the initial stages. With inflation remain- ing at nearly 7 per cent and a public-sector deficit amounting to 10.5 per cent of gross national product, Italy looks firmly in the slow lane. Preparation of the 1992 bud- get took place against the background of such interna- tional pressures. Yet no agree- ment was reached last week. Further meetings were due to take place over the weekend in an effort to avoid an early gen- eral election and Italy's 51st post-war government. This is an inauspicious back- ground for a bond market rally. However bonds closed the week on a gross yield of 12.90, slightly stronger on the week and well up on the 13.40 seen at the end of August. The market has been sup- ported by factors other than domestic economic and politi- cal fundamentals. Structural reforms have encouraged inter- national investors to commit funds to the market, which continues to offer the highest yields of any developed govern- ment bond market. * The Italian treasury announced last week it had authorised withholding tax repayments amounting to L4.2bn - the first batch of claims processed under its new \"streamlined\" procedure for reclaiming tax. News that repayments have been made prompted a half- point rally in 10-year bond prices on Monday. This may seem an extreme reaction, but the old system was so unrelia- ble that many investors looked only at net yields, even though withholding tax could, in the- ory, be reclaimed. The difference is substantial. At the government's L3,000bn auction of 10-year bonds last week, which was twice over- subscribed, the net yield was 11.08 per cent. * The Matif, the Paris futures exchange, and the London International Financial Futures Exchange both launched futures contracts on Italian government bonds dur- ing the month. Since the Liffe contract was launched on September 19, daily volume has averaged 11,000 contracts. In addition to generating publicity for Italian bonds, the contracts do appear to have increased trading activity in the cash market. While such structural improvements will help to attract overseas cash, the strength of bond prices is rooted in a belief that inflation, interest rates and bond yields will gradually converge with those of the lower-yielding countries in Europe. On this basis, net yields could fall to 9 per cent by the end of 1992. A view among ana- lysts is that with yields at such high levels the domestic politi- cal and economic situation is less significant. Simon London",

   "text_content" : "IT had to happen. The gilt rally of the past two months came to a juddering halt last week, although many gilt practitio- ners still have high hopes for further gains towards the end of the year. Long-dated UK government securities lost ground in terms of price by nearly a point dur- ing the week, while short-dated bonds were mainly stable. Con- sequently, yields for many types of gilts, particularly those maturing around the turn of the century or later, rose for the first time in weeks. Typical was the benchmark 9 per cent Treasury bond pay- able in 2008. The yield for this was quoted on Friday night at 9.4 per cent, up from 9.3 per cent the week before. One of the factors behind the change was* the increased standing of the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. This shook the confidence of many in the City that the rul- ing Conservatives would be likely to win the next election. As many in the City equate a Labour government with calamity, that led to nervous- ness among cognoscenti. The main aspect, however, was that many investors came UK gilts yields Restated at par (%) 9.8 27,1991 9.4 Sep 20, 1991 0 10 years 20 30 Source: Waburg Seuriies round to the view that gilts were looking overpriced com- pared with equivalent bonds issued by overseas govern- ments, and also with equity investments. Consequently, there was some switching away from the UK government securities and into other bonds, particularly US and Jap- anese instruments. The mood was evident dur- ing the Bank of England's auc- tion of Â£1.5bn of long-dated 9.5 per cent conversion stock, due in 2004. The auction was over- subscribed by a factor of 1.9, significantly less than the two earlier auctions this financial year. There was some evidence that much of the buying activ- ity was by market-makers, which dived into the auction with gusto, only to find pur- chasing interest from investors such as pension funds less than whole-hearted. A comparison of gilt yields with those of other govern- ment bonds provides some jus- tification for thinking that the UK government securities may have become too expensive, even bearing in mind the favourable short-term inflation outlook for the UK. According to figures from UBS Phillips & Drew, over the past month gilt yields at a 10-year maturity date have declined by 18 basis points (0.18 per cent), with the yield of a 10-year gilt at the end last week being quoted at around 9.8 per cent. The down- ward movement in yield over this period equates roughly with a 2-point rise in price. Over the past month, gilts have performed better than the equivalent 10-year bonds issued in Germany and France, where yields have fallen by 2 basis points and 11 basis points respectively (to stand on Fri- day at 8.4 per cent and 8.8 per cent). Even with the outlook for lower interest rates in Britain being relatively favourable over the next year, thanks to the demand-squeezing effects of the recession and the expec- ted impact of the exchange rate mechanism, it is by no means clear that the yield dif- ferential between UK bonds and German and French secu- rities should narrow much more. (The clear winners in the bond world in terms of per- formance over the past month have been US and Japanese stocks, where yields have come down by 25 and 28 basis points respectively, mainly due to lower projections for economic growth in both these coun- tries.) As for the future, many mar- ket-watchers believe that the fall in prices last week was just a temporary hiccup. Mr Roger Bootle, an economist at Mid- land Montagu, said: \"The mar- ket has seen a slip, but because of the inflation outlook I remain generally positive about the trends for gilt prices over the next few months.\" Peter Marsh",

   "text_content" : "THE US Treasury bond market rallied on Friday as investors appeared to be persuaded that the Federal Reserve will launch a further interest rate cut in October and the US eco- nomic recovery began looking increasingly weak. Spurred by reports from a White House meeting that brought together the President, his chief economic advisers and Mr Alan Greenspan, chair- man of the Federal Reserve, the benchmark 30-year Trea- sury long bond was marked %h of a point higher on Friday to 1031. The resulting yield of 7.817 per cent represented the lowest long-term interest level since March 1987. Investors, how- ever, reckon this week's Open Market Committee will still decide to ease rates beyond the recent cuts in the discount and Fed funds rates. The White House economic meeting on Friday, the second of the week, fuelled specula- tion that an election-conscious President Bush is putting pres- sure on the setters of monetary policy to help stimulate the economy with fresh interest cuts while asking bank regulators to go easy on the troubled banking industry so as to ease the nation's credit crunch. One version of the meeting, provided by a Market News Service report that excited traders on Friday afternoon, had Mr Greenspan telling the President that the economy might be \"fundamentally strong\" but was \"going into a 50 mile per hour headwind\". For his part, Mr Bush is said to have told Mr Greenspan he is concerned about the sluggish pace of economic recovery. Just in case Mr Greenspan didn't hear the President, the jaw-boning continued as the Bush Administration's public relations machine was switched on full. \"People are still having trou- ble getting money, especially small business. We want to make sure that examiners are aware of this problem and that steps are being taken by the banking industry to see that indeed they are not being overly restrictive on their loans,\" said Mr Marlin Sitz- water, the President's spokes- man. The credit crunch, said Mr Robert Mosbacher, the Com- merce Secretary and Bush con- fidante, \"is not a minor prob- lem. It's very serious\". The latest macro-economic data seem to bear out Mr Bush's concerns about the flagging recovery. Last week it was reported that the contraction in second- quarter GNP was revised down from a drop of 0.1 per cent to a negative 0.5 per cent. Durable goods orders for August fell by 3.8 per cent and growth of US consumer spending slowed almost to a standstill, declining by 0.2 per cent on an inflation- adjusted basis. The weakness of consumer spending is all-important in the US economy, where the consumer accounts for around two-thirds of all demand for goods and services. This week analysts are pre- dicting more statistics indica- tive of a faltering recovery. Most significant will be this Friday's unemployment report for September, which is expec- ted to show the unemployment rate rising from 6.8 to 6.9 or even 7 per cent - the peak level of last June. The latest purchasing man- agers' survey, which could show a drop of at least one point from the previous level of 56.6, is released today. On Wednesday, the new home sales data will probably reveal a 0.8 to 1.0 per cent fall and, on Thursday, the August factory orders numbers will most likely be down by 1.6 to 1.8 per cent. The US economy is bumping along in a most erratic way. Salomon Brothers noted on Friday that the smorgasbord of figures suggests an uneven US economic performance. Add to this the Fed's concerns about weak M2 growth, the continuing credit crunch and a confused picture of business and consumer confidence, and a further rate cut by the Fed seems virtually assured. Mr Phillip Braverman of DKB Securities put matters bluntly at the weekend, noting that slackening economic activity calls the \"recovery\" into question. The US econ- omy, Mr Braverman summed up, \"remains mired in reces- sion\". The Federal Reserve, of course, hates to cut interest rates when it appears to be giv- ing in to political pressure. So participants at last Friday's White House meeting - a meeting where interest rates would presumably have been a key topic - made a point of stressing that there was no dis- cussion of interest rates. That diplomatic nicety, say the cyn- ics of Wall Street, should make it easier for Mr Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed to get on with the next rate cut.

   "text_content" : "BANKERS are looking forward to a busy final quarter in the syndicated loans market, thanks to the recent spate of takeover bids in the UK. BTR, the industrial conglom- erate which is bidding nearly Â£1.5bn for engineering group Hawker Siddeley, revealed details of the debt financing for the deal last week. Barclays, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation are jointly arranging a Â£lbn facility which matures on December 31, 1992, paying a margin of 32.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and commitment fees of 15 basis points. BTR has traditionally been very aggressive with its banks. However, bankers believe that - assuming the takeover goes ahead - the loan should be successfully syndicated, as BTR's relationship banks will be looking for additional busi- ness from the company. Few details have emerged on Hanson's plans for Beazer, fol- lowing its recent Â£351m offer. However, most bankers expect that Hanson will be able to renegotiate Beazer's debts on more favourable terms. Beazer's total indebtedness stood at Â£1.25bn in August. This included an unsecured term loan arranged in 1989, which last month was renegoti- ated and increased and is now a $2.5bn master facility agree- ment maturing on December 31, 1995. NatWest and Citibank, the lead banks, are understood to have received a success fee of Â£16m for renegotiating the loan with the 108 participating banks. Originally, Beazer paid a margin of 125 basis points over Libor, but after the renegotia- tion the margin was raised to 175 basis points over Libor. Beazer agreed to pay the banks $600m by the end of March 1992, using the proceeds of its planned flotation of its UK-based house-building, con- tracting and property busi- nesses. According to the agree- ment with its banks, if Beazer does not proceed with the flota- tion, the banks can seize Bea- zer's assets. While Hanson's bid put an end to the flotation plans, the question remains as to what Hanson will do about Beazer's debts. Hanson can borrow much more cheaply than a company in Beazer's condition. Its most recent syndicated loan was arranged in 1989 to finance the acquisition of Consolidated Goldfields. This was a Â£3bn loan with a margin of 15 basis points over Libor. The front- end fees then were three basis points for a commitment of Â£300m, two basis points for a commitment of Â£200m and one basis point for Â£100m. Of course, pricing today is now double or three times the level it was in 1989. One banker has suggested that Hanson might have to pay between 40 and 50 basis points over Libor for a three- to five- year facility. E Schroders has been forced to improve the terms of a Â£125m five-year revolving cash advance facility which it launched for Chelsea Building Society earlier this month, fol- lowing strong criticism over the pricing and structure. The facility will now take the form of a term loan - rather than a revolving cash advance facility - with a mar- gin of 35 basis points over Libor. Schroders and Hill Samuel have \"underwritten an amount sufficient to ensure the suc- cessful completion of syndica- tion\". Originally, Chelsea planned to pay 30 basis points over Libor and a commitment fee of 12.5 basis points on the undrawn portion of the revolv- ing cash advance facility. Chel- sea had agreed to keep at least 60 per cent of the facility drawn and had intended to use the entire facility.

   "text_content" : "FAVOURABLE conditions for international bonds have per- sisted in most sectors during the third quarter of 1991. Sev- eral markets ended the quarter at high points for the year, which should stimulate further activity in the fourth quarter. Total new issue volume so far this year is up $50bn on the first nine months of last year, at $175bn, according to the International Financing Review's Bondbase, reflecting the strong performance of international bond markets. However, the gap is exagger- ated by the hiatus in new issue activity which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last sum- mer. The Canadian dollar market has been particularly strong, pushing secondary market yields to very tight levels, rela- tive to the Canadian govern- ment bond market. The strength of the Canadian dollar has fuelled interest among retail and institutional inves- tors, who are keen to benefit from the yield pick-up of around 175 basis points over US Treasuries still available in the Canadian bond market. New issue volume in the sec- tor has surged to nearly US$14bn equivalent, compared with just over $4bn during the first nine months of last year. This results in part from heavy supply by Canadian provinces, which have been unable to ful- fil their heavy financing needs in the domestic market. The Euroyen market also experienced a renaissance, boosted by a strong rally in the Japanese government bond market during the last few months. A Y120bn 10-year offering by the Japan Develop- ment Bank in August, the larg- est to date, prompted renewed interest in a sector which has been suffering from increasing lack of liquidity in recent years. Volume in the Euroyen sector climbed from $12.5bn last year, to $20.5bn, although the number of issues fell. The increased new issue activity is expected to persist in the last quarter, although many Japanese corporate deals will continue to be placed in the Far East, and will not be actively traded. The flow of deals could be boosted as Japa- nese companies try to resin- ance equity warrant deals, many of which are due to mature next year. Because of the poor performance of the stock market, many warrants have not been exercised. Despite a weaker perfor- mance this quarter, volume in the Ecu sector has more than doubled at Ecu28bn, boosted by a surge of new issues by Euro- pean governments in the first quarter, including the UK's debut issue. Volume in the fixed-rate dol- lar market is up $10bn at $32bn, despite poor swap opportunities. Further supply is likely to be boosted by tight yield spreads and relatively low interest rates, which may persuade borrowers to lock in current interest rates. Investor demand is expected to remain strong, boosted, as in the Cana- dian market, by an appetite for current coupon bonds which are not trading above par. Nomura International has maintained its position at the top of the bookrunners' league table, despite the continued malaise of the dollar-denomi- nated Japanese equity war- rants market. Morgan Stanley, which entered the top 20 at number six, made the largest jump, despite having only arranged 15 deals. Its position was boosted by several prestigious mandates in the Ecu sector.

   "text_content" : "THE strength of the US economy's recovery from reces- sion continues to dominate the dollar's movements. This week will be no exception as cur- rency dealers wait for the Sep- tember employment report on Friday. UK clearing bunk hbe landlg rats 10.5 per cnt from Septmber 4, 1991 The indicators last week provided mixed signals on the economy and the dollar remained locked in a narrow trading range. US administration officials remained upbeat, anticipating a strong rebound in the current quarter. However, the market is not convinced and there is a growing belief that there will be no rapid recovery. This view is likely to be supported by the September employment report, which is released on Friday. Non-farm payroll employment is expected to rise by just 10,000, compared with the 34,000 increase in August. Another jobs report showing little employment growth will be bound to lead to pressure in the market for a reduction in US interest rates. The Federal Reserve may be willing to relax monetary policy if the recovery is showing signs of faltering. But it is not clear whether this will cause the dollar to slide. Longer-term institutional investors have begun to pick up dollars and seem likely to do so again if the dollar weakens. There are also technical reasons for believing the dollar will not give up all of the gains it is made so far this year. Some chart analysts believe the dollar could soon move higher. With the market unable to make up its mind on the dollar the US currency may just remain stuck where it is despite the jobs figures.

   "text_content" : "Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president, speaks to Stephen Fidler and Damian Fraser he Mexican president is invested with extraordi- nary power. In his own land, his will is law. He faces little opposition from Congress, where his party has tradition- ally carried an unassailable majority, or from constituent states, all but two of which are run by his party. He gets an easy ride from the local press and is never criticised on domestic television. The current holder of that office is Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who at 43 is half way through his six-year term. His position has been strengthened by the convincing victory of his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), in mid-term congressional elec- tions last month. Though not entirely free of accusations of ballot rigging, the result partly erased the memory of the fraud-tainted 1988 poll which brought him to office. August's congressional result showed, Mr Salinas said, that voters \"want change to continue\". In his first three years, Mr Salinas moved quickly to con- front Mexico's economic ills, such as stagnant growth and inflation (50 per cent annually in 1988; 16 per cent today). In an interview at Los Pinos, the presidential residence in Mexico City, he confirmed his impatience for further reform. \"We are doing things which a few years ago would have been considered anathema.\" He has buried years of antago- nism to begin talks with the US over a free trade agreement which will also include Can- ada. He has privatised large sectors of industry, and tackled the entrenched power of the trades unions. The government has signed a deal with foreign banks that should, given no oil price collapse, put the coun- try's external debt problem firmly into the past. As a result, investment funds are flooding into Mexico, helping to rekindle growth after a decade of economic decline. This may yet turn out to be the easy part. Some in his administration believe the big- gest political gambles of the Salinas presidency may lay ahead. Mr Salinas and many of his cabinet colleagues are products of the best of US education. The president himself has three Harvard postgraduate degrees. While these qualifica- tions have been an asset in dealing with economic prob- lems, ministers have their work cut out in countering opposition criticisms that as foreign-educated technocrats they fail to understand the lot of the average Mexican. Those close to the president say he is a man who does not likes to lose, but he is not averse to changing his mind. Content to allow significant freedom to his ministers, he will nonetheless quickly seize upon the weaknesses of any proposed policy. He will take risks, but only after discount- ing the alternatives. The son of a minister, Mr Salinas comes from a family steeped in politics. In Mexico, politics has been dominated by the PRI, which, with its earlier incarnations, has run the coun- try since 1929. While couching its activities in revolutionary rhetoric, the PRI has always been guided less by ideology than by its desire to hold on to power. This has involved successfully resolving the claims of the three main interest groups that have dominated Mexican soci- ety: peasants, urban workers and the professional classes. The PRI's corporatist struc- ture, which pervades most sac- ets of public life, looks increas- ingly outdated in the modern and pluralistic society to which Mr Salinas aspires. Mr Salinas has stated before that he intends to reform the party, and has been criticised for not moving faster. His dilemma is that it is the party which has brought him to power and has strengthened his mandate in the mid-term elections. As the British histo- rian Hugh Thomas has remarked, Mr Salinas is like a woodcutter who has \"set about cutting the branch of the tree by which he has climbed and on which he is sitting\". The president insisted that much had already been done to improve confidence in the elec- toral system in Mexico, but there was still more to do. The PRI itself has, he says, undergone changes since the 1988 election. It campaigns bet- ter, picks better candidates, and has improved its internal organisation, but, again he adds, there is more to do. The PRI, he says, must improve its \"territorial organi- sation\" - a hint that it needs to enhance its grassroots sup- port and ease its reliance on its traditional backers - unions, farm leaders and teachers. Mr Salinas will also seek reforms to separate the party from the state, a distinction once regarded as irrelevant in Mexico but now seen as an essential component of a truly competitive political system. After three years of eco- nomic reform, his commitment to yet more change is undimin- ished. \"Our commitment is simultaneously to have politi- cal and economic change.\" The president believes that a comprehensive North Ameri- can Free Trade Agreement could be in place by the first part of next year. The accord is seen by the government as, more than an opportunity for furthering growth; it is seen as a device that will, in effect, make Mr Salinas' economic reforms irreversible.

Having signed this month a free trade agreement with Chile, the first in Latin Amer- ica, Mr Salinas says he wants to conclude more, perhaps even with Japan. Mr Salinas is also directing his reforming zeal to two new areas: education and agricul- ture. The education system has provided the country with a relatively high literacy rate (more than 90 per cent of peo- ple can read). But higher edu- cation is in a mess, teachers are poorly paid, there is little vocational training and school textbooks are outdated. In Mexico, agricultural reform is a highly charged political issue. About a quarter of the people depend directly on the land, but they produce only 8 per cent of gross national product. No previous president has dared to over- haul agriculture. Community ownership of many farms and the state's permanent commit- ment to redistribute land - a reaction to the perceived evils of large landowners - are, like the educational system, still an important legacy of Mexico's bloody revolution of 1910-20. The agricultural system, says Mr Salinas, increases uncertainty and discourages investment. \"We have over-ex- tended the process of land redistribution in Mexico.\" Mr Salinas has promised leg- islation within six months to reform agriculture. His com- ments suggest he favours abol- ishing the artificially high prices of maize, although a decision has not yet been made. In its place, income sup- port for poor farmers was \"a very clear possibility\". Would he also tackle Petro- leos de Mexico (Pemex), the world's fourth largest oil com- pany, which permeates every cranny of the production and use of oil and gas in Mexico? Mr Salinas has committed himself to further change at Pemex. \"We cannot afford to have an inefficient public sec- tor entity like Pemex, because that will permeate into the rest of the economy.\" The reforms have helped to refashion the perception of Mexico abroad, and changed Mexico's perception of itself. '\"The most important thing to consolidate is a change of men- tality: meaning, self-confidence in opening the country to the rest of the world.\" Yet he still faces many chal- lenges. Although his anti-pov- erty programme, Solidarity, which will spend $1.8bn this year, has done much to improve the lot of the poor in some areas, he agrees that more must be done. According to the World Bank, almost a fifth of Mexico's 82m people do not have enough to eat. Mexico's record on human rights has recently been rebuked by Amnesty Interna- tional and the government is finally begining to respond to such criticisms. The environ- ment is another important issue, particularly in the capi- tal, whose 20m inhabitants make it one of the world's most populous cities. Mr Salinas is seen by many Mexicans as likely to end the 130-year split between government and the Roman Catholic church; most Mexicans are Catholic. The Mexican system has given Mr Salinas extraordinary scope to tackle these issues. But it has placed one impor- tant constitutional limitation on his powers, deliberately put in place to prevent the rise of a dictatorship: presidents can only serve for one term only. Would he like to stay on? \"There is a constitutional pro hibition and that speaks for itself,\" he said. And in four years? \"I will be unemployed.\" 'Voters want change to continue in Mexico'",

   "text_content" : "he appointment of three new Law Lords to replace Lords Bridge, Brandon and Oliver has pro- voked much gossip in the Inns of Court, from among whose members candidates for high judicial office are exclusively drawn. The appointments mean that no fewer than one third of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (the UK's supreme court) will change. Yet this has merited little attention in our national news- papers. In contrast, a single appointee to the US Supreme Court has attracted, and is still attracting in Britain alone, acres of newsprint space, Why is it, despite the com- parative lack of openness in the British system of appoint- ing its judges, that there is so little media (and presumably therefore public) interest in judicial appointments other than when a notorious case or a miscarriage of justice thrusts the individual judge before the public eye? The British judiciary is selected nowadays without so much of a whisper from the public. It was not always so. In the 19th century, newspaper commentators were much more forthright about appoint- ments to the High Court bench. When Lord Campbell in 1859 startled the legal pr1lesiaon by appoin a feow Scot and a near rele juor counsel at the Egisbarb9 ty ms t or CoHn 1111kb1n1 The Times leader writer expostulated: who is Mr mlackburar Te rpe turned out to be ounde Which only goes to prove hat whatever the irhdof appolitment there were bou tobe both irreers- ible mistakes and dubious JUSTINIAN appointments that turn up trumps. This is because it is difficult - perhaps not impos- sible in the light of modern methods of psychological test- ings - to predict what sort of Judge a person will make. If the quality of judges depends upon the method and scope of selection and the stan- dards set by the appointing authorities, the risk of mistake is minimal in the case of a judge's promotion to an appel- late court Mr Blackburn's demonstra- tion of all the essential quali- ties of a judicial mind was such that he was made a Law Lord when the Appellate Com- mittee was rnndin 1876; his retirement 10 years later was regarded as an irreparble loss. IS the reti*e1-e of the p ae tfoay to comment on Judical Iapp tments the proeduct of a sef-imposed strait-jacket, .nd!d in their lear of the of contempt? Although scandausing the judiciary is strictly a part of the law of contempt of court, its appia tion is, howneve, largely obo- If the media were to coun- ment on the three new Law lads they would haw Mch to observe, not least became, unusually, not all three appointments are to take effect at the same time; Lord Bridge does not retire until February when Lord Justice Mustill will finally take his place. Until the second world war it was common for appointments to the bench to reflect the political complexion of the gov- ernment of the day. The tradi- tion of non-political appoint- ments was firmly established by Lord Jowitt in 1947. It has been maintained ever since, with the exception of a few of the appointments made by Lord Kilmuir in the late 1950s. All three new appointees have obtained golden opinions within the profession and to the outsider appear to reflect a Judiciously liberal outlook to the law. None has had any out- ward poitical afliations. Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkin- son, for the last six years the vice-chancellor (head of the Chancery Division), has had 15 years on the bench in the course of which he has been -nnovative without eva incur- ring any suggestion of idiosyn- cratic law making.

Sir Gordon's progress from being a High Court judge and a judge at the European court to the House of Lords, without first going to the Court of Appeal, will provide further evidence to continental Euro- peans of the importance which the UK now places on its repre- sentation at Luxembourg. Sir Gordon's replacement at Luxembourg is a matter of acute speculation. The betting is that the Lord Chancellor will favour a Scottish judge. Scot- land has a more natural affin- ity with the legal systems of continental Europe; Sir Gor- don's predecessor, the first British judge at Luxembourg, was Lord Mackenze Stuart, a former judge of the Court of Session.

   "text_content" : "resident George Bush must have been relieved to propose deep cuts in nuclear arsenals. By making a bold foreign policy announce- ment he was able, once again, to divert attention from domes- tic problems. Last week the White House was embarrassed by poor economic figures, including the first sharp increase in poverty since 1983. The Bush administration is puzzled that the economy is not yet showing convincing signs of recovery. The Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates sharply - to the lowest levels since the mid-1970s - and taken steps to boost bank profitability. But monetary growth has not picked up and consumer demand appears to be fading rather than strength- ening. What is going wrong? Part of the answer requires a trip down memory lane. Remember the 20m service sec- tor jobs created during the Reagan years? At the time this was hailed as conclusive evi- dence of the US economy's dynamism and flexibility. In a post-industrial society, expan- sion of services was seen as the key to future prosperity. The Reagan administration demanded free international trade in services in order to capitalise on its advantage and sneered at the \"sclerotic\" Euro- pean Community where dole queues were spiralling. Well, it now appears that US service industries over-ex- tended themselves: many of these jobs should never have been created. In the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review, Mr Stephen Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street invest- ment house, argues that US service industries became chronically inefficient in the 1980s. \"Shielded by regulation and confronted by few foreign competitors, service companies have allowed their white-collar payrolls to become bloated, their investments in informa- tion technology to outstrip the pay-backs, and their productiv- ity to stagnate.\" But with recession, the day of reckoning arrived. US ser- vice companies are now aggressively shedding labour, cutting costs and rationalising operations. This restructuring, comparable with that under- taken by US manufacturers nearly a decade ago, is being super-imposed on the normal business cycle, complicating the interpretation of economic trends. Although beneficial in the long run, the job cuts are undermining consumer confi- dence and inhibiting recovery. Mr Paul Mastroddi, an econ- omist at JP Morgan, the New York bank, addresses the same theme in a recent research note. During the expansion of the 1980s, he argues, service industries were able to raise prices by more than 5 per cent a year, well above the 3-4 per cent received by manufactur- ers. This inflation differential hid their relative inefficiency. But tighter monetary policy, following Mr Alan Greenspan's appointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve, squeezed the economy and prevented them passing on excessive costs to consumers. The infla- tion differential has vanished, and service producers - from retailers and wholesalers to banks and local government - are retrenching. \"As a result, the economy is unlikely to grow rapidly ... despite the recent declines in interest rates.\" In previous recessions, man- ufacturing held the key to eco- nomic prospects. This is because the service sector pro- vided a relatively secure back- drop, generating job opportuni- ties almost regardless of the plight of \"smoke-stack\" Amer- ica. This time the roles are reversed. The decline in manu- facturing employment was unusually mild. But the employment performance of service industries has been worse than in 1973-75 or 1981-82 even though gross national product fell much less steeply. Retailers, transportation, gov- ernment, finance, insurance and real estate all shed labour; only in health care was growth uninterrupted. It is no accident that the indicators signalling economic strength in recent months - from industrial production to the Purchasing Managers' Index - relate primarily to the manufacturing sector. Manu- facturing output has grown at an annual rate of nearly 8 per cent since April, but may soon falter. The sector's resilience reflected big improvements in productivity during the 1980s and the competitive dollar, which supported exports. Nei- ther factor applies in the case of service industries, which mostly remain depressed. A manufacturing-led recov- ery that shifts resources into export industries is desirable given the big trade deficits accumulated during the 1980s. The problem is that service industries account for about three-quarters of private sector jobs. Weakness in services today is thus potentially more damaging for growth than weakness in manufacturing in the early 1980s. As Mr Mas- troddi argues, a much larger proportion of the workforce is worried about job security and pay prospects than in previous downtutns. Even jobs in state and local government, once wholly secure, are now under threat. The broader exposure of workers to the rigours of recession goes far to explain the poor outlook for consumer demand, an essential engine of economic recovery. The White House is likely to press for further interest rate cuts and more resolute action to ease the \"credit crunch\" - the alleged inability of credit- worthy companies to obtain loans. Such measures may help at the margin. But to the extent that the economy's fail- ure to grow reflects more fun- damental forces - such as a restructuring of the service sector or an overhang of debt - they may prove irrelevant. The real story of this recession is the shadow cast by the excesses of the 1980s. Only time can heal these wounds. MICHAEL PROWSE on America",
