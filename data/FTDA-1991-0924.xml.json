   "text_content" : "By David Buch.a In Brussels THE Dutch presidency of the EC will today propose a his- toric shift of lawmaking power to the European Parliament in the final draft treaty for Euro- pean political union. Under the draft, the parlia- ment would have virtually the same say in making EC laws as national governments. A senior member of the Dutch presidency of the EC said yesterday that the move to greater democracy in the Community was the price demanded by Bonn for its agreement to monetary union. The controversial Dutch pro- posals will constitute the final battleground on which EC states will hammer out the next steps on political union. The UK government, facing mounting opposition froin the right wing of the Tory party to a federal urope in te run-up to a general election, seems sure to oppose the move. However, even keen support- ers of economic and monetary union (Emu) such as France will find the proposed sharp extension of MEPs' legislative rights a high price to pay for German approval of Emu. On the other hand, the Dutch draft contains partial concessions to countries such. as Britain and France which want to keep sensitive foreign and internal security policies out of the hands of the Brus- sels Commission and the Stras- bourg parliament. The Dutch draft lays out the ground for the 10 weeks of An-ahtd amccoid ..............Page 3 Lameors dlHouR hand..Page 22 Joe Regaly .....................Page 23 EC farmn refmr..............Page 36 negotiation remaining before the Maastricht summit in December. Then the Twelve are supposed to sign a com- bined political and monetary union treaty. The Dutch have already been criticised for making such late and radical changes to treaty drafts they inherited from the Luxem- bourg presidency, and they are unlikely to do so again. At present, the Council of Ministers, representing govern- ments, passes legislation and the 518 MEPs, voting in ideo- logical rather than =ational blocs, can only amend it with Commission backing. Under the Dutch plan, they would be able to: * Reject virtually any law by an absolute majority (260 votes); e Ensure certain categories of legislation (on aid to the third world, high-tech R & D and environment) could only pass with their majority approval. These rights had previously been considered as alternative ways of reducing the Commu- nity's \"democratic deficit\". Now the Dutch, strong believ- ers in a federal Europe and spurred on by Germany, are proposing to give MEPs both, with the possibility of further lawmaking powers in 1996. The Dutch believe they have made an important concession to Britain and France by giv- ing the initiative on external and internal security policy, to \"the Community and its mem- ber states, each with their own competence\", rather than just to \"the Community\". But UK officials say London is unlikely to be much impressed. On external security, the Dutch draft talks of the devel- opment of \"a Community defence policy over the long term, complementary to Nato and the Western European Union\" defence organisation. This will not go far enough for the UK, which wants the EC to keep defence sub-contracted out to the WEU organisation, Continued on Page 24 Dutch CtimslM hm Page 1 which in turn would be closly linked to Nto.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By LIsa Wood and Ivo Dawnay THE TREASURY is pressing Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, to accept cuts of Â£1.lbn in his training and employment bud- gets over the next three years, according to a confidential memorandum leaked to the labour party. The memorandum, sent in August by Mr David Mellor, the Treasury chief secretary, rejects Mr Howard's warning that reduced budgets would have \"a devastating effect\" on morale at Training and Enter- prise Councils and throws out his demand for k total 13Sm increase in employment and youth training spending next year. Instead, it seeks cuts of Â£100m a year, over three years, in both the Youth Training (YT) and the Employment Training (ET) budgets, making 00m over the period. Other savings would come from axing Business Enterprise Training - described as \"a luxury we can no longer aford\" - along with Career Development Loans and reduced spending on the Enter- prise Allowance and schees for the disabled. Mr Mellor spells out in graphic terms the togh choloe in this autumn's public spending revie, empwas.ing that iacreased social rity brought on by unem- plymet \"lver*y constrains cwat can be ant ib r other In lnuguage that looks or- tain to prove politically mbar- rassin for a government that claims an exemplary record on training it states that tOcts 1l:m a yewd to I mploymet alary Review a, \" Ik Pap M Training Continued from Page 1 Training over three years can- not be achieved there would be \"no alternative\" to reducing places.

Projected expendi- ture for this year was Â£34bn. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said the cuts, if implemented, would devastate training provi- sion in Britain and wreck the morale of the Training and Enterprise Councils. A Tec executive said the Treasury letter illustrated its narrow view of traninag, relat- ing it to unemployment and not to wider issues such as the regeneration eos the economy.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber and Michael Lltlejohns at the UN and Bronwen Maddox in London 490 Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, speaking at the Palestine National Council in Algiers, where he expressed a readi- ness to work towards making the proposd Middle East peace conference a success. Report, Page 4 UNITED NATIONS inspectors were yesterday prevented by Iraqi security forces from seiz- ing carloads of documents pro- viding the first clear evidence of Iraqi designs for a nuclear bomb. A UN official said virtually all the papers had been \"forci- bly stripped off UN trucks\" by the Iraqis in violation of UN resolutions. The find came hours before President George Bush vowed not to compromise in enforcing UN demands to inspect and destroy Iraq's non-conven- tional weapons. The US was last night con- sulting with Britain, France and other allies on implement- ing its plan outlined last week to send jet fighters to escort UN teams seeking access to Baghdad's non-conventional weapons sites. Any move might be coupled with a 48- hour ultimatum to Iraq to com- ply with UN demands. In a speech to the UN gen- eral assembly, Mr Bush accused Iraq of defying UN res- olutions mandating access to Iraq's suspected weapons sites, and criticised Iraq's treatment of the 15-member UN nuclear inspection team in Baghdad. Although Mr Bush stopped short of disclosing the likely US response and did not refer to the threat to send fighter escorts, he gave the impression that Washington's patience with Baghdad had worn thin. \"We can't compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. We will not compromise,\" he said. He made clear, however, that he wanted to consult allies before taking further action. \"Until we know a little more, no decisions will be made as to what the US will do,\" he said. Mr Bush repeated that the US had no quarrel with the Iraqi people, only with Presi. President Bush yesterday urged the repeal of the 1975 UN resolution equating Zion- Ism with racism. In a bid to ease tension with Israel ahead of a planned Middle East peace conference, Mr Bush used his UN speech to term the resolution \"an intolerable sin\" ignoring the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews, writes Lionel Barber in Washington. Any move to overturn the 1975 resolution is unlikely to succeed before next month, when the peace conference is tentatively planned. Report, Page 6 dent Saddam Hussein, whom he called a brutal dictator. The president made clear his view that Iraq's failure to com- ply fully with UN demands to destroy its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons repre- sented a critical test for the credibility of the UN. He recalled the response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the US-led coalition victory in the Gulf war under UN author- ity. \"The coalition established a model for the collective set- tlement of disputes.\" In the six months since the end of the war, Iraq had failed to co-operate fully with the UN. \"The US view is that we must keep the UN sanctions in place as long as he [Saddam] remains in power.\" The documents found in Iraq - some of which the team photocopied - included plans of explosive charges needed to detonate some types of devices and was evidence that Iraq had begun to design equipment to make nuclear weapons. Previous UN missions had established only that Iraq had built factories to enrich ura- nium - the essential ingredi- ent for nuclear explosives - and could have had enough for a weapon within 18 months. The inspection team is expected to announce shortly the names of western Euro- pean companies it believes have supplied Iraq with ura- nium enrichment technology. A UN official said: \"The last mission brought fragments of equipment back in suitcases, assembled them on the floor in Vienna and we know now it could only have come from one or two companies.\" In New York, Mr Jean-Bern- ard Merime6 of France, the UN Security Council president, called yesterday's Iraqi action a \"very serious incident\". Iraq, however, rejected the UN team's version of events, saying it agreed to the request to take the documents \"pro- vided. .. receipts [were] issued to register the documents taken by the team.\" The team did not do this.

   "text_content" : "By Paul Abrahams and Nell Buckley ASTRA, one of Britain's leading arms companies, was driven close to collapse after crucial financial details were withheld during the takeover negotiations for PRB, a Belgian company which supplied pro- pellant for the Iraqi supergun. The negotiations for PRB took place between Astra and Gechem, a chemicals company, which is 60 per cent owned by Socidtd Gdndrale de Belgique, Belgium's largest conglomer- ate. Gechem's decision to sell PRB to Astra in 1989 followed the collapse of negotiations with SRC, the company owned by the late Mr Gerald Bull who masterminded the Iraqi super- gun. PRB's contracts with Iraq provided British intelligence with some of the first firm evi- dence that Dr Bull was trying to build a supergun in Iraq. In summer 1990, PRB became one of Belgium's biggest corpo- rate bankruptcies with the loss of more than 1,400 jobs. The sale is the subject of a Depart- ment of Trade and Industry investigation. Astra bought PRB from Gechem in September 1989 for Â£20m, having been told it would make a BFrl50m (Â£2.3m) profit for the year on a turn- over of BFr6bn. In fact, the subsidiary made a BFr720m loss, on a turnover of only BFr4.8bn, bringing Astra near to collapse. Astra's executive directors were all subsequently ousted from the board. Mr Jean Duronsoy, Gechem's chief executive, yesterday announced his surprise resig- nation from the Belgian chemi- cals group, which lost BFr256m after tax in the first half of 1991. Mr Duronsoy denied any link between the resignation and the sale of PRB. Gechem denies it misled Astra about PRB's financial position. The Financial Times has learnt, however, that Mr Duronsoy was aware six months before PRB was sold that the subsidiary would sig- nificantly undershoot its BFr6bn turnover budget. On three occasions before Astra acquired the company, PRB's management warned Mr Duronsoy that PRB was set to undershoot the BFr6bn target by up to BFr.2bn (Â£20m). Yet Mr Duronsoy failed to disclose Continued on Page 24 Gechem chairman resigns, Page 30 Information withheld from Astra caf.ropi the updated turnover estimates to Astra. Under Belgian law companies are obliged to nego- tiate in good faith. Gechem bad an obligation to inform Astra of PRB's revised projections. During 1989, Mr Bull offered to buy a 75 per cent stake in PRB for a \"symbolic price\". If the deal went through Mr Bull would provide contracts for countries including China, Pakistan, Jordan and Iraq. The negotiations collapsed after Gechem was unable to obtain guarantees from the Belgian government for exports to some of these countries. The warnings made by PRB's management to Gechem were explicit. In June 1989, managers wrote a worried internal memorandum to Mr Duronsoy. \"It is useful to men- tion that all the negotiaiom with Astra are based on a sce- nario of results for 1989 that was established in October 1988. For various rea- sons ... the scenario has not held true, it has been revised downwards since March 1989. To our knowledge the manage- ment of Astra has not so far been informed by Gechem.\" Three weeks earlier, another internal memorandum had warned Mr Duronsoy that once Astra realised the turnover was not on target, this would render the pooition of PRB's management perflous\". Ther was a significant risk of a rup ture\", it said. Yet even when PRB's mnamnment warned in August that the turnover tar get had been revised down again to BFr4ta, Gechem faied to infom Astra. By selling PRB, Geheme avoided substantial costs related to decommissioning the subsidiary's five factories and redundancy pments. Astra later claed that h-d it known the true state of PRB, it would have paid a nominal -a of BFrl (1.Up) Instead of Â£0m, and then invested the remaAider in the company. Mr Duronsoy agrees he knew of the revised figures, but. argues that Astra should have known about them. Before a inding agreement was siued on July 17 IrM, Stay Haywar, Astra's auditors, were given imited access to PRB's records. Stoy Hayward, he rgIes ade doIous m m bR to verify the 10 largest con- ctns a PRB's books, but did not mae the same eMors to h fck the overall turnver es -a r the year. Moreover, the preliminary sale agreement signed in July, 1989, gave Astra ftll and imme- diate access to PRB documents during the period before the completion of the deal in Sep tember. However, Astra dill failed to establish PRB's true position. Astra's former menagn nt claims that in practice full access was not given. In 1990, Astra's British law- yers, after advice from their Belgian counterparts, recom- mended legal action against Gechm. However, Atra's new gngement deied to swept a 3m cash p en in May 1990 for snder certain claims against Mr Roy Barber, Astra's present chairman, id them funds were vital for the survival at the coampany.",

   "text_content" : "Yugoslav extremists have found a martyr, writes Judy Dempsey ATTEMPTS to implement a lastiqg ceasefire in Yugoslavia are in danger of being under- mined by an extreme national- ist movement in Croatia which is committed to reviving the republic's historical borders and achieving independence. The Croatian Party of Rights (HOS), with roots in the last century; has just found itself a martyr in the form of Mr Ante Paradzik, its vice-president and commander of its military wing, who was killed on Satur- day night. Only hours before his death, in disputed circumstances, Mr Paradzik said the party's mili- tary wing would keep fighting as long as the coalition between the Yugoslav federal army and Serb paramilitary units continued and Croatia was \"occupied\" by Serbia. The Croatian government said police opened fire when Mr Paradzik's driver refused to stop at a road-block. However, Mr Ivan Rosanic, a Croat dmigrd who returned from Canada to support and finance the HOS, claimed that the police fired without warning. \"I was in the car at the time. We stopped at the road-block. The police stood back from the car and killed Mr Paradzik. I do not know if it was a set-up,\" he said. The HOS has no seats in par- liament, but it has been a thorn in the side of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), headed by Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, ever since it was re-established in February 1990. It has repeatedly accused Mr Tudjman of incompetence, of being \"too soft\" with the eth- nic Serb community in Croatia, of refusing to mobilise the pop- ulation against the federal army, and of lacking any coherent military and political strategy. Some Croat intellectuals believe Mr Paradzik was on an HDZ hit list because he was giving the wrong image of Croatia. \"His views were too extreme, even for the HDZ,\" commented on academic. HOS leaders claim the party has over 10,000 highly-trained men throughout the republic. They say some of these men have been armed by the Cro- atian national guard, the republic's official army, while others are volunteers. The -movement has branches throughout the world, and is financed by 6migrds. A Croatian historian yester- day disputed this, saying the force was no bigger than 800. HOS's origins go back to 1861, when Mr Ante Starcevic founded the Party of Croatian Rights as a platform for emerg- ing Croatian nationalism. His entire political philoso- phy was based on re-establish- ing the state of Croatia, which was independent before it was brought under the crown of Hungary in 1102, with the aim of a new, centralised, unified and independent state of Croa- tia encompassing Bosnia-Her- cegovina. Its present leaders adhere to those aspirations. On the wall of HOS's head- quarters in Zagreb is a map depicting a greatly-enlarged Croatia. It includes a portrait of Tomislav, the first King of Croatia (925-928), and a photo- graph of Mr Ante Pavelic. In 1929, Mr Pavelic founded the Ustasha, or the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation - a'secret group with the aim of achieving Croatian indepen- dence through terrorism and armed struggle. In April 1941, the Ustasha, backed by the Nazis, founded the Independent State of Croa- tia (NDH). In the quest for creating a \"pure Croatian race\", the Ustasha killed tens of thousands of Jews and Serbs. NDH slogans are today sprayed on walls in parts of Zagreb and its suburbs. Mr Dobroslav Paraga, the president of HOS, who was imprisoned in the mid-1960s by the former communist regime, said at the weekend: \"We will fight, not only for our indepen- dence, but also to regain those territories which were once part of the Croatian state before 1918.\" After repeated questioning, Mr Paraga denied that HOS identified with the Ustasha. \"We do not support the policies of that time during world war two,\" he said. \"But we want independence. We have asked for a demo- cratic and peaceful resolution at all time for Croatia. But instead, we receive a knife in the back. Since 1918, we have been under Serbian occupa- tion.\" 0 Miles 75 0 Km 120 HUNGARY MANIA VOJVODINA CROATIA Novi Sad SERBIA Sarajevo figures in the darkness. We waved and they waved back.

   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Zabalj, Vojvodina WHEN the military police turned up at this village in the Serbian province of Vojvodina north of Belgrade on Sunday they were greeted like harbin- gers of doom. They wanted to mobilise reservists for the war in Croatia from a village which is now Serb but which before the first world war was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Next day, yesterday, was market day. As 500 of the thou- sand-strong male population were sent off to war \"everyone was crying, the men and the women, as if the most terrible event had happened,\" recalled a 43-year-old architect who refused to give his real name for fear of recrimination. Zabalj is a Serb village. But it is also is a deeply divided community whose divisions are not ethnic but a product of the region's tragic past. The second world war destroyed the old balance in Vojvodina. Thousands of Hun- garians and ethnic Germans were killed or expelled. Their homes were given to waves of Serb colonists from poor regions of southern Yugo- slavia. The influx created a division between \"old settlers\" and col- onists sharper than the old ani-- mosities between Serbs and Hungarians. These divisions deeply condi- tion attitudes to the civil war. Half the inhabitants, the colo- nists and their descendants, form the backbone of support for the fighting in Croatia. The other half, the old settlers, mostly oppose the war. Many old settlers blame the war on Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who three years ago toppled the government of the then auton- omous province of Vojvodina lnd incorporated it into Serbia. Standing on the steps of the house where he was born, the architect said: \"Our enemy is not Croatia, but the govern- ment who has whipped up this senseless war.\" Dusan, aged 35, was one of those rounded up for military service. \"The police woke us up at 2am. No one told us where we were going. We were sent to the front after two sleepless nights with no idea of our destination.\" Once they arrived an officer told them to \"clear the ter- rain\". The officer stayed behind. \"He said there was no danger, and told us just to throw bombs into cellars and houses,\" Dusan added. Their destination turned out to be Vukovar, a once attrac- tive country town in eastern Croatia on the banks of the Danube. It is now in ruins after two months of battles. \"When we reached the edge of the fields, we saw some dim",

Mr Alezander Shokhin, the Russian labour minister, said yesterday that nominal control of Russian enterprises and energy resources had already changed hands twice, in the last few weeks. The Russian cabinet was last night meeting to discuss the issue. \"If this goes on, production will fall dramatically. The catastrophe will be awful and we shall not survive the winter,\" Mr Shokhin told econ- omists in Moscow. The struggle between the Soviet authori- ties, represented by the Committee for the Management of the National Economy, and the Russian and other republic gov- ernments, is being decided in the favour of the latter. Most politicians and officials in the republics say there is little chance of a meaningful economic agreement between them and the centre. The situation is complicated by the fact that Mr Ivan Silayev occupies the top Mr Gavrril Popov, mayor of Moscow, has further to hi cache of confis- cated buildings by taklfn over the cam pus of the Academy of the National crONmy, the most prestigious of the capital's economic Institutes.

Mr Popov, whose motives have not been made public, has already taken over a number of big sites - 'laingu the former Comecon headquarters an the main Lenin Museum off Red Square.

The State Council, which unites the Soviet and Republican presidents, has agreed \"in principle\" to sign by October 5 an Inter-Republican Economic Agreement, worked out by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a member of the four-man leadership of the Comittee of Management. However, both Mr Shokhin, and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the chief economic adviser to Mr Anatoly Sob- chak, the increasingly influential mayor of St Petersburg, said yesterday it would be a merely formal document, which the repub- lics would ignore. \"Ihe Yavllnsky plan is not realistic: it is too tough for the republics to accept and we must rid ourselves of the illusion that they will,\" said Mr Shokhin. Pressure is building on the Russian gov- ernment to proceed with its own plan for economic reform, abandoning all attempts to make common cause with the other republics, all of which depend on subsi- dised purchases of raw materials, espe- cially oil. Mr Yevgeny Saburov, Russian deputy prime minister and economics minister, said yesterday he had already drawn up such a plan, which would see a phased sell-off of up to 50 per cent of all state assets by the end of 1993, liberalisation of 70 per cent of state prices by the end of this year, a freeze on government spend- ing and a profit tax increase. Mr Chubais said the only way to co-ordi- nate reform between a number of repub- lics would be for Russia to \"go it alone\" - with other republics agreeing to co-operate on Russia's terms.",

The Communist backlash, the first of any success in the Soviet Union since last month's failed coup, brought up to 5,000 protesters onto the streets of Dushanbe, the repub- lic's capital, and into a tense stand-off with an equal number of Communist supporters in the city centre. Tass, the news agency, reported the city centre para- lysed as the crowds erected barricades and traded angry chants, closely policed by cir- cling Soviet army helicopters and units of the OMON special interior ministry forces. A state of emergency imposed after riots in Dushanbe last February, largely sparked by economic issues, which left 22 dead and more than 700 hurt, was lifted only recently. Mr Aslonov's decree was an attempt to woo Tajikistan's three main opposition groups, the Democratic party, the Islamic party and the Rasto- khez popular movement. Street protests by these groups late last month forced the resigna- tion of Mr Kakhar Makhkamov as president after allegations that he had backed the abor- tive coup in Moscow, which he had failed publicly to condemn. However, Mr Aslonov's decree and a simultaneous dec- laration by Mr Maksud Ikra- mov, mayor of Dushanbe, that all statues of Lenin in the city could be removed incensed the republic's Communists, who remain a potent force in the poor and conservative southern republic.

It would seem to have been placed there as either wishful thinking, or else a distinctly grim joke. For in spite of the enthusiasm with which Esto- nian customs officials are now checking the motor traffic passing across the border, Estonia still lacks effective control over the vast flood of grubby red roubles still swirl- ing between Russia and the other Baltic republics. \"We might be politically independent now, but we're still part of the rouble system,\" says Mr Mart Opmann, Esto- nian deputy minister of eco- nomics. Like most Estonians he believes his tiny country's only hope of building a strong econ- omy in the near future lies in a policy of insulating the econ- omy, at least partially, from the rapidly disintegrating Soviet economic and monetary system to the east.

Fears about the so called \"eastern threat\" are shared by many Estonians. Because Estonia is widely recognised to have the best chance among the ex-Soviet republics of suc- cessfully moving towards a market economy - partly because of its close ties with Scandinavia, and partly because of its relatively pros- perous infrastructure - Esto- nians expect entrepreneurial Russian businessmen will seek to invest in Estonia, recognis- ing that it may provide more security than the disintegra- ting Russian economy. So far, Estonia has been enthusiastic in encouraging private enterprise and foreign investment. The latter, largely in the form of joint ventures with Scandinavian partners, now accounts for over 3 per cent of GNP - 16 times more than Lithuania, for example. Over 4,000 small farms have been privatised, and many small businesses are being auc- tioned off or turned into joint stock companies.

The key difficulty is the question of convertibility. On one hand, most Estonians see little point in introducing a new currency unless it is potentially convertible. But if the Estonians do try to create such a currency they fear it will be rapidly bought up by non-Estonians seeking to convert their worthless roubles into a potentially more secure currency. And if Estonia were to attempt to limit convertibility between the rouble and kroon, it would devastate trade between Estonia and the rest of the Soviet Union - which accounts for over 97 per cent of Estonia's \"foreign\" trade, according to Mr Mehis Plv, head of the Estonian Foreign Trade Departmen \"If we cut our trade with Russia now it will break us,\" says Mr Kaido Klaassen, man- ager of the Tartu Apparatus Constnruction Plant, which like many other Estonan hactaori is so closely integrated Into the centralised economy that it now makes the only supply of thermostats for industrial refrigerators in the Soviet Union.

The news comes amid prepa- rations by the US to end its opposition to the Soviet Union gaining full membership of the IMF and World Bank, though a final decision on this may still be some months away. Mr Willi Wapenhams, World Bank representative, said he had been \"surprised and impressed\" by the steps taken by the Baltic republics towards market reforms.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt SPENDING should be curbed in west Germany before the government increases value added tax to help overcome the fiscal problems caused by German unification, the Bund- esbank said yesterday. The public sector, especially the Linder (states) and local authorities, had to reduce defi- cits to a level bearable over the long term. \"Restraint in public spending should have priority over tax increases that would be problematic from a growth or stability standpoint,\" the bank said in its latest monthly report. It referred to the risks for economic stability of the gov- ernment's plan to lift VAT from 14 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bund- esbank president, has already expressed concern that a VAT rise could worsen inflationary tendencies by contributing to a new wage-price spiral. A VAT increase would not take effect until 1993. Petrol and other consumer taxes have already been increased to help pay the price of unity. A one- year income tax surcharge of 7.5 per cent has also been introduced. The Bundesbank said spend- ing restraint (in west Ger- many) would maintain confi- dence in the stability of public finances. \"Monetary policy would then have much of the load taken off it in its task of safeguarding the value of money internally and exter- nally.\" Although the integration of east Germany had made huge demands on Germany's public finances, the Bundesbank said this year's total public sector deficit (including social secu- rity payments) would be at the bottom end of the expected range of between DM140bn (Â£47.6bn) and DM160Obn. It could even be less than DM140bn, because of higher tax revenues and the gradual pace of some public investment in the east. Such deficits could only be tolerated for a short transi- tional period. The Bundesbank said the federal government had taken important steps towards con- solidating the budget in 1992, but this would be made harder by big increases in pensions and health spending, partly in east Germany. This made cau- tious spending policies throughout the public sector more vital. Editorial comment, Page 22"

The confession by Stora, which is number two among European packaging produc- ers, comes after a raid in late April by EC monopoly investi- gators, acting on a complaint by the British Printing Indus- tries Federation against 15 companies that allegedly formed the cartel. Stora, which is the first com- pany to disclose publicly its role in the cartel, launched an internal investigation into the activities of its packaging operations within its Billerud and Feldmuhle subsidiaries after the EC action. \"We found that there were certain practices, amounting to concerted behaviour with competitors, that were not consistent with either Stora policy or the EC anti-competi- tion laws,\" said Mr Nils Gras- strom, Stora's chief attorney. Stora then informed the EC of its role in mid-August. Rumours within the packag- ing industry that Stora has been co-operating with the EC authorities have been rife for the last few weeks, with alle- gations that the company was hoping to avoid heavy penalty fines. Companies convicted of cartel practices could theoreti- cally face a fine amounting to 10 per cent of annual turnover. \"We are not betraying our competitors. We are just responding truthfully to the EC's questions. We are not doing this to avoid a fine, which would be much smaller in reality,\" said Mr Sven von Hoist, Stora's information director. Swedish, Canadian and Aus- trian companies dominate the European packaging market. Mayr-Melnhof of Austria is the biggest, with a market share of 20 per cent. The EC has suspected the cartel has existed for at least three years. The raid, which affected Iggesund Paperboard and Colthrop Board Mill in the UK among others, was launched after the BPIF com- plained its members were get- ting identical piÃ½c .iiile ees for packaging materiafrom a range of producers."

Mr Grzegorz Wojtowicz, who headed the central bank until last month and was arrested last week, faces a maximum eight-year prison term. The charge says he failed to stop one of the owners of Art B, a private company, from \"kit- ing\" cheques around banks between December and last July. Art B exploited the inade- quacies of Poland's banking system by moving cheques from account to account faster than the banks were able to notify each other, thus earning interest in several places at the same time. The operation ended last July when Mr Wojtowicz ordered that banks should notify each other telegraphi- cally as soon as cheques had been deposited. Art B's own- ers, who last month fled to Israel, have said they earned around 100bn zlotys (t5.2m) on the operation, 40 per cent of which was paid in taxes.",

   "text_content" : "By OgorgeGraham in Washington THME US and the European Community yesterday signed a ground-breaking agreement to co-operate on competition pol- icy. The agreement sets up ways for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which are responsible for-anti- trust policy in the US, to work with the European Commis- sion on mergers and anti-com- petitive abuses. The agreement will allow competition authorities in the EC and US to call on each other for information or for help in preventing competition abuses by companies in each other's jurisdiction. It will also allow them to co-ordinate enforcement activities where they feel a combined approach is appropriate. \"It could contain more, but it Is a first step in the direction of increasing co-operation,\" commented Mr Ronan Harty, an anti-trust lawyer with the law firm of Davis Polk & Ward- welL EC and US anti-trust author- ities have in the past helped each other informally, but the agreement will make such col- laboration more systemat- ic -although it makes no change to the existing competi- tion laws in the EC or US. One innovative aspect of the pact is that both sides have adopted the principle of \"comity\", agreeing to take into account each other's legitimate interests when considering whether to take anti-trust action. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said the agreement was designed to prevent trouble rather than to deal with trou- ble that had already arisen. \"Frankly, I think we have been very lucky, because the potential of conflict has existed,\" he said yesterday. Sir Leon had earlier indi- cated that he believed the agreement might serve as a P model for similar pacts with r Canada and possibly Japan. i Ms Janet Steiger, FTC chair- i man, said the agency had ; reviewed some 1,500 deals Sunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino law on mergers in the last year. Of these, 340 deals involved foreign companies, i and 160 involved EC member countries. Competition experts yester- day said the agreement could i lead to tougher control of mergers, and warned that com- i panies might face greater diffi- culty in winning approval - because of the increased i exchange of information by i competition authorities.",

The islands, ranging In size from 50 to 200 acres, are mostly in the Saronic Gulf within easy reach of Athens. However, few are equipped with harbours, electricity or water supplies. Government revenues this year have fallen well below Finance Ministry projections. Income from privatisation, forecast at Dr200bn (E650m), is less than Dr20bn, while tax revenues for the first half of the year rose by 24 per cent, compared with a forecast of 33 per cent. Opposition parties have crit- icised plans for the sale. The government is having the value of the islands assessed and the Defence Min- istry will have a say on their military potential before a decision is made. The European Community's monetary committee has warned that extra measures must soon be taken if Greece's economic stabilisation pro- gramme is to succeed. The inflation rate is down from 22.8 per cent at the end of 1990 to 17.4 per cent, and the current account deficit is expected to shrink from $3.2bn last year to $2.2bn (Â£1.3bn).

   "text_content" : "SIR YUE-Kong Pao, one of Hong Kong's most successful businessmen and confidant to many world leaders, died yes- terday from respiratory failure at 72. He leaves behind a $4bn (Â£2.8bn) empire including the world's largest independent shipping fleet and substantial property and hotel interests. Sir David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, in paying trib- ute last night to Sir Y-K, as he was known, described him as \"perhaps the first Hong Kong businessman to achieve a truly international stature\". Sir Y-K claimed to shun poli- tics but he was one of only a handful of Hong Kong busi- nessmen with immediate access to China's senior leader- ship. He was one of an elite 23 Hong Kong business and social leaders oin the Beijing-ap- pointed drafting committee for the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 mini-constitution. Since 1980 he had regularly met Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, and made high-profile donations to uni- versities and other causes in China. He was also renowned for large donations to charities, education and the arts in Hong Kong. The esteem in which he was held in Britain was recog- nised with his knighthood in 1978. Sir Y-K's political views, though he avoided expounding them publicly, were conserva- tive and pro-business, and he was believed to have been wary about greater democracy in the territory. His personal demeanour was recently described by his eldest daughter as \"very dour\": she recalled how he blocked plans to hold her 21st birthday party on a company launch because she \"did not earn it\". However, he allowed himself the two pleasures of swimming and golf. He occasionally played golf with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's husband Denis, who described Sir Y-K's style with understatement as \"though not the greatest golfer, he's quite competitive\". The former Brit- ish prime minister wrote the foreword for a biography of Sir Y-K last year. In business - the day-to-day running of which Sir Y-K has relinquished in the last two years - he will be remembered for his conservatism as much as his flair and determination. Oddly, though, his group's three most prominent ventures of recent years have all had an unhappy outcome. First, he suffered losses of some HK$lbn (Â£74m) in 1989 on selling a near-10 per cent stake in Stan- dard Chartered, the UK bank- ing group where he had become deputy chairman three Â·:~: .:Â·~::Â·Â·jÂ·: Â·Â·.

Second, despite his political clout in Beijing, his ambitions for Dragonair, a privately held airline flying to China, were frustrated when it failed to gain sufficient landing rights. Sir Y-K sold out last year to Cathay Pacific and the Chi- nese-controlled Citic group. And third, a consortium led by his Wharf International col- lapsed in disagreement last year after winning the tender to build and operate a cable television system in Hong Kong. Sir Y-K was born in Ningbo near Shanghai, the son of a wealthy merchant, and trained as a banker. He came to Hong Kong in 1949 just before the communists seized power in China. But he retained close links with the country and in Hong Kong became an influen- tial member of the Ningbo bang - literally, the Ningbo gang, a powerful and tightly knit group of emigrd business- men in the territory. In the early 1950s he contin- ued to trade with China in the face of a widely observed embargo against the commu- nists. But at that time he per- suaded his family to move into shipping, apparently preferring moveable assets to fixed investments such as a paper mill seized by the communists. To his death he refused to invest in any corporate ven- ture in China, insisting that he would only do so when such a move made commercial sense. Sir Y-K's infant shipping group earned windfall, profits following Nasser's 1956 seizure of the Suez Canal. By the end of that year, it had increased its ships from one to seven. He established close relation- ships with the Japanese, who built and chartered his vessels, and with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corpora- tion, which financed much of the expansion. As the group grew, Sir Y-K developed a canny ability to buy and sell ships ahead of market shifts in price, and had a similar sense of timing for long-term leasing. By the mid-1970s he con- trolled ships totalling 20m deadweight tonnes - this com- pared with the 3.5m tonne fleet controlled by the late Mr Aris- totle Onassis. Sir Y-K's fleet has declined to about 14m dwt today, reflecting diversification and the shipping market prob- lems of the 1980s. Sir Y-K returned to shore in 1980 when he acquired control of the Wharf Company, one of Hong Kong's oldest companies, With interests in cargo han- dling, hotels and transport. Wharf then bought Wheelock Marden, which also has a long colonial history - a takeover that the group has only recently digested. Wharf now has a market capitalisation of HK$20.3bn. It has become one of the colony's largest property companies and has expanded hotel interests to include the worldwide Omni chain. But Wharf, and the other main listed company, World International, earned reputa- tions for being rather dull. Rumours in 1988 that Sir Y-K had died lifted the share prices of the companies on hopes that they would become more aggressive. As Sir Y-K slowly reduced his role, they indeed tried to project a more asser- tive imagej But, given their less than complete success in recent forays, the stock market may this time provide -inore dignified reaction.

   "text_content" : "Unlike some other high-profile business tycoons, Sir Y-K Pao took steps to distance himself from his empire before his death, writes Angus Foster in Hong Kong. His departure is therefore unlikely to lead to the upheavals of succession which are common in the fiercely proprietorial Chinese business world. Sir Y-K split his empire into four separate parts, giving voting control to his four daugh- ters. Their husbands have taken over the man- agement of the companies since Sir Y-K started to withdraw in 1986. Worldwide Shipping, man- aged by Dr Helmut Sohmen an outspoken Ger- man lawyer, is a private company controlling Sir Y-K's shipping interests. The company owns more than 80 ships, mainly registered outside Hong Kong. Mr Peter Woo, a Shanghalnese banker, man- ages Wharf International and its holding com- pany World International. Wharf is one of Hong Kong's largest property companies and is presently redeveloping sites which will double the company's property port- folio to close to 10m sq ft by 1993.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney MR Alan Bond, once the highest-flying of Australia's corporate entrepreneurs, may face bankruptcy proceedings after a judge ruled he must repay a personal debt of US$194m (Â£115m). Mr Justice Rogers, in the New South Wales Supreme Court, said a personal guaran- tee given by Mr Bond could be enforced by Hongkong Bank of Australia, which had lent the money as part of the financing for a nickel project. The judge rejected Mr Bond's claim that Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corpora- tion, the parent company of the Australian bank, gave an assurance the guarantee would not be enforced. The loan was part of a US$336m loan to a subsidiary of Dallhold, Mr Bond's pri- vately owned family company, which was put into receiver- ship in July after failing to make repayments. The Judge said it was Incon- ceivable\" that Mr Purves would have given such an undertaking, and decribed Mr Bond's account as \"inconsis- tent with the objective ects\". Mr Bond later ought a stay of the Judgment to allow time for appeal, and to prevent the immediate commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by Hongkong Bank. The judge, who will rule later on the application, said he would need \"a sound rea- son\" to deny the stay. The bank said it was concerned that a delay would hinder any future examination of Mr Bond's financial transactions. Mr Bond told the court he had few assets left, other than 450,000 (Â£23,000) in three bank accounts in Perth and a super- annuation fund of around AMm from Bond Corporation Holdings, formerly his quoted flagshbi He said his house in a Perth suburb was worth AS17m, but was owned by a family trust of which he was not a benefi- dary.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Lamli Andoni in Algiers and Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem MR YASSIR Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organ- isation, yesterday reiterated its demands on the convening of a US-sponsored Middle East peace conference, but left the door open for Palestinian par- ticipation. In his keynote speech at the opening of the Palestine National Council, a parlia- ment-in-exile, Mr Arafat expressed the PLO's \"readiness to work with all the interna- tional parties to make the peace conference successful\". But Mr Arafat, faced with pressure from Palestinian radi- cals to reject any Israeli or US restrictions on Palestinian attendance, also said: \"Let everybody know, we reject the Israeli blackmail and the Israeli conditions.\" He deliber- ately avoided saying whether the PLO would authorise Pales- tinians from the Israeli- occupied territories to take part in the peace conference, which is supposed to begin next month. Mr Arafat and his supporters hope the PNC will vote this week in favour of resolutions which underline Palestinian demands but allow the PLO leaders to frame their own response on representation. Israel has said it will take part in the conference, pro- vided the PLO is not repre- sented and provided no Pales- tinian delegate is from the disputed city of Jerusalem. Most Palestinians reject the principles behind Israel's con- ditions but some feel that they should not lose this chance of winning self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians from the occu- pied territories yesterday pro- tested against Israel's refusal to let them travel to Algiers. Fresh hope for Mann's release PRO-IRANIAN kidnappers in Lebanon last night said they would release the British hos- tage Mr Jackie Mann within 48 hours, Renter reports from Beirut. The statement by the Revo- lutionary Justice Organisation, sent to an-Nahar newspaper with a photograph of US hos- tage Mr Joseph Cicippio, whom it also holds, appears to contra- dict the stance it took last week. The kidnappers then said there would be no further hostage releases until Israel had liberated 20 more Arabs. Lat night, however, they wel- comed efforts by Mr Javier Pdrez de Cuellar, UN secretary-general, to negotiate the release of 10 remaining western hostages and missing Israeli servicemen in return for Arab prisoners held by Israel. As a first step, Israel had released 51 Lebanese prisoners and the bodies of nine guerril- las this month. The kidnappers said that Mr Mann, a former pilot aged 77 who has been in captivity since 1989, would be freed \"to pre- pare for the next stage\".",

   "text_content" : "OME ISRAELIS are more apprehensive than others about the prospect of a Middle East peace settlement and a treaty with Syria - and the most nervous of all are the 11,500 settlers on the Golan Heights, the scenic and strate- gic plateau that Israel won from Syria in the 1967 war. The latest trip to the Middle East by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has done nothing to allay their fears. In Damascus last week, he told the Syrians that UN reso- lutions calling on Israel to hand back occupied territory applied on all fronts. \"That means they apply not just to the West Bank and Gaza but to Golan as well,\" he said. Israeli politicians and gener- als are staking out negotiating positions ahead of the proposed Middle East peace conference next month by repeatedly emphasising the strategic - importance of the Golan. Notable by its absence, Pow- evebr, isn- categorical Israeli gov9rnment reassertion of Isabl'I soveteigity,' although residents of Qazrin, the largest Israeli town in the Golan, and other settlers, are lobbying ministers for a firm commit- ment to keep the plateau. Israel extended its laws to the Golan in 1981, but Israelis assume that Mr Yitzhak Sha- mir, their right-wing prime minister, might cede some of the territory to Syria in exchange for a solid peace treaty to secure Israel's north- ern border - provided the heights are demilitarised. Palestinians, meanwhile, suspect that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria would readily abandon the Palestinian cause, and the Palestinian claim to a homeland in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, if he won back the Golan. Unlike the Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria to the settlers) the Israelis in the Golan are hamstrung by the area's lack of religious signifi- cance in Jewish history. They are doing their best to change that - Mr Meir Monitz, Qazrin's deputy mayor, says that Qazrin was a Jewish set- tlement in the Talmudic period 2,000 years ago and that 20 syn- agogues have been found on the Heights - but their most compelling argument for keep- ing the Golan is the appalling reputation of Mr Assad among Israelis. \"Nobody knows what he wants and I don't think it's wise to give away the Golan in exchange for a piece of paper,\" says Mr Mikhail Pastov, an immigrant from the Soviet Union. Even in the age of the ballis- tic missile, the Golan Heights Victor Mallet, recently in Qazrin, Golan Heights, reports on the staking out of negotiating positions in Israel, ahead of a proposed Middle East peace conference are a strategic asset. Any land attack from Egypt would be blunted by the desert between the two countries, but an attack from the Golan would give Syria immediate access to northern Israel. The Golan is also an important watershed for a region plagued by a short- age of water. Up on the plateau the Israeli settlers optimistically suggest that Syria's goodwill should be tested over a period of say, 50 1 years; the, twould be prepared to live in peace with the Syr- ians, but: would not want to move trom their homes. The 15,000 Arabic-speaking Druze * and AlawitWvillagers have mixed feelings; they have little love for Israel, but they fear that their links with Israel will not endear them to Mr Assad if A lone kebab vendor tUM a a erte rnoppi arcade in East Jerualm ystrdayen strike call by the Palestlan underrnd leadership and when he takes over. There is no hesitation among Israelis down below in the vul- nerable \"finger of Galilee\". Ask for their thoughts on Syrian control of the Golan and they point up at the nearby hills and tell you about the bad old days. \"We feel that without the Golan Heights we are in grave danger,\" says Mr Prosper Azran, mayor of Kiryat Shmona. But Palestinian guerrillas continue to try to launch raids across the Lebanese border - using everything from hang- gliders to foot-soldiers - and Syria's increasingly strong grip on Lebanon makes a lasting peace with Damascus a desir- able goal. For Israel, the quarrel over the Golan, unlike the emo- tional debate over Jerusalem, is essentially one of security. If Israel is safer without the Golan, then the Golan will probably have to go. Until security is guaranteed, the inhabitants of the heavily militarised northern part of Israel will never be completely relaxed. .\"We live here as though we were in a bunker,\" says Mr Azran. \"We live like an army here.\"",

In a move aimed at easing tensions with Israel ahead of a planned Middle East peace con- ference, Mr Bush denounced the resolution as \"an intolera- ble sin\" which ignored the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews in the Second World War. Speaking at the opening of the UN General Assembly, Mr Bush said: \"This body can't claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's. right to exist.\" The US has long opposed the 1975 resolution adopted by Arab countries with the sup- port of the Soviet Union. Some western countries, notably Britain, believe that the US must push for a convincing majority against the resolution if the move is to be politically effective. It is unlikely to be passed before next month, when the Middle East peace conference is tentatively planned. In is speech, ush spelt out his iio of what he calls the \"new. world order to be built now thatIte Cld War is over.

In this spirit, Mr Bush issued a strong appeal for a successful conclusion of the Gatt multilat- eral trade round, and warned delegates against protection- ism. \"The Uruguay Round offers hope to developing nations ...

Mr William Taylor, head of supervision at the Federal Reserve, is expected to win rel- atively easy confirmation, from the Senate banking committee today, for the chairmanship of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which underwrites the deposits of col- lapsed banks. But Mr Robert Clarke, whose hearings are to begin on Thurs- day, seems likely to face a much rougher ride as he seeks approval for a second term as Comptroller of the Currency.

The Government Accounting Office, a congressional audit- ing body, has criticised Mr Clarke's handling of the failure this year of the Bank of New England.

   "text_content" : "By Emiko Terazono In Todk*o BLOCKBUSTER Video, the US video rental chain, is planning to enter the Japanese video rental market, by presenting its strong brand image - as McDonald's has done with amburgers and Toys R Us has ne with toys - in a market where brands have been non- existent. Despite a slowdown in the rental video market, Block- buster thinks it can succeed with its clear focus on the fam- ily. Its first store which opened in Hachioji, a western suburb of Tokyo last July, as with the US chain, does not rent por- nography or horror films, the tradlional mainstay of the rental video business. Instead, it offers a wide range of main- stream hits and children's films and cartoons. In the near future, Block- buster plans to team up with McDonald's and Toys R Us, to open outlets where all three businesses operate. Mr Sango Morita, managing director of Blockbuster Japan, says that the concept is to get customers to drive to the store, eat at McDonald's, buy toys at Toys R Us, and go home with a Walt Disney video. Apart from families, Mr Mor- ita says they are also targeting women. Half of the 7,500 mem- bers at the Hachioji store are women. Other video rental shops have also started to focus on the family as a new market. A venture set up in Yokohama by a consumer loan company, pro- vides a bakery, an eat-in area, video game software corner, stationary shop and a' ticket counter in addition to renting videos. Sunhome Video, a video rental chain run by Nagasaklya, a leading super- market chain, also offers a video selection for children and video game software. After extraordinary growth in the mid-1980s, growth in the Japanese video rental market has slowed. Total revenue\" peaked in 1988 at an qetimated ___ ^.^' \" . __ Y356.6bn (Â£1.5bn) as intense competition eroded profits and closed smaller stores. The Japan Video Association says that in the end, two extreme sides of the spectrum wltemain: the large-sized 40M' stores and chains like Blockbuster and the smaller, owner-run stores. Unlike other retailers, the video business is fairly new with less rigid distribution, and is an easy market for new- comers to gain a foothold. But Mr Morita adds that sophisti- cated points of sale are essen- tial. Many convenience stores which ventured into the busi- nesi hit product difficulties. Blockbuster plans to open 10 stores in the next year and start a franchise in late 1992. Despite concerns that satel- lite and cable television could hurt the video rental business, Blockbuster is bullish about its frt e po pects , and lans to ts shares on the apanese over-the-counter market within five years.",

In a strongly-worded statement to the UN General Assembly, he said so far there had been \"words, words and more words\", but little action. Time was running out and the alternative to success- ful negotiations would be a series of trade blocs turning in on themselves. \"If the selfish win, if Gatt fails, then today's leaders have planted a seed for future conflicts,\" Mr Bolger said. \"That is a strong message but no more than the seriousness of the situation warrants.\" New Zealand is one of the 14-member Cairns Group of farm produce exporters.

   "text_content" : "By Chritina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro THE FATE of Brazil's privatisation programme is likely to stay n the balance until today, with a federal court ruling on whether to allow the first sale still awaited. Last night, it seemed the decision might be delayed until no more than a half-hour before the sale time of 5 pm GMT today. The sale of Usiminas, Bra- zil's largest steel mill, was suspended on Saturday by a federal judge. This was in response to a civil action by an opposition senator who ques- tioned an increase in equity for the company's Japanese minority shareholders and participation of foreign debt instruments in the bidding. This is the second suspen- sion of the sale. Last month a lobby group in Minas Gerais state, where the mill is, won a court injunction on the' grounds that Usiminas is inalienable state property. ThC National Development Bank (BNDES), overseeing the privatisation programme, managed to have the iljunc- tion overturned. Yesterday, BNDES officials said they were confident of victory in their appeal against the Saturday ruling. Failure of th appeal would be a great embarrassment to the Brazilian ,government, which hopes to rale, $18bn. (Â£10.6bn) by the end of 9M2 to reduce debt.

Especially when the business in question could have a real future, given the chance. But if you are running the subsidiary of a large corporate parent company you may not ever get that chance. In good times, group priorities will always tend to outweigh yours, making opportunities hard to take. And in a chilly economic climate, if a parent company catches a cold, junior goes down with it too. No matter how healthy your underlying business prospects may be. How can a company that finds itself in this situation get back up where it belongs? Phildrew Ventures could be the answer.We are a small group of businessmen who specialise in helping talented management teams to buy themselves out from corporate ownership. Because we're not a stuffy city institution, our interests are wider than just the immediate financial details of any deal. In fact, we pride ourselves that by putting our heads together with yours, we can help you develop the long term business and investment strategies, your company needs. Unlike a lot of people in this field for instance, we take the trouble to stay involved after the buy out, to help with future acquisitions and capital requirements. We can sometimes help out with introductions to new trading contacts too. And being a small dose knit team, we're flexible enough to make big decisions very quickly indeed. So far we've helped to organise more than fifty major buyoutns this way. Giving the managements concerned precisely what they have always wanted; the chance to get up off the floor and get on with it.

   "text_content" : "By Paul Betis, Aerospace Correspondent BRITISH AIRWAYS is expected to acquire more US- powered Boeing 777 aircraft than it originally announced last month. The decision increases the blow to Rolls-Royce, BA's tra- ditional engine supplier, which was also bidding for the order. The deal is also a setback for British Aerospace, a 20 per cent shareholder in the Euro- pean Airbus consortium, which had hoped to clinch its first significant order with BA for its A340 long-range airliner, to be rolled out next week. BA said the final agreement, to be completed with Boeing at the end of this month, may now involve 35 rather than 30 US General Electric-powered Boeing 777 aircraft, including 15 firm orders and options for a further 20. BA said it had a long-term requirement for 30 aircraft, but needed an addi- tional five to begin certifica- tion for extended-range operations over water. The UK carrier announced last month that it had reached a memorandum of understand- ing with Boeing, involving orders potentially worth Â£4.4bn for 777 twin-jet and 747 four-jet aircraft. BA said at the time the deal involved 15 firm orders plus a further 15 options for the new Boeing 777 twin and the intention to order up to 24 additional Boeing 747s. BA selected the US General Electric GE90 engine for its 777s and Rolls-Royce RB211 engines for the 747s. Rolls-Royce had hoped to clinch the BA deal to launch its new, high-thrust Trent engine on the 777. Rolls-Royce has since launched the Trent on the 777 by winning a Â£250m order for the engine from Thai Airways. The BA deal appears to have involved from the start a pack- age of 35 Boeing 777s as well as the 24 Boeing 747s. A confidential document from one of the parties to the deal claimed BA decided to restrict its announcement to 15 firm orders and 15 options for the 777s because Airbus, Boe- ing's European rival, had been asked to bid on 30 aircraft. The document suggested the announcement for the new 747 orders was vague because BA wished \"to magnify the poten- tial value of the Rolls business on the 747s to soften the public relations impact of the GE90 commitment\". It suggested BA was \"push- ing hard\" for Boeing to develop a new large-capacity aircraft at the end of this decade.",

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins LEGISLATION to toughen the regulation of Britain's telecom- munications and gas industries will be introduced by the gov- ernment in the next session of parliament, assuming there is no autumn general election. Powers to insist on compen- sation when standards of ser- vice are not met and on fixed appointments for customers are expected be included in a bill being drafted by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, is expected to emphasise the government's determination to improve the standards of the privatised util- ities in his Conservative party conference speech next month. By introducing the bill, Mr Lilley will be implicitly accept- ing that the government has been caught on the defensive in the political debate over the performance of utilities. The debate was further fuelled by the launch of Mr John Major's Citizen's Charter. Labour yesterday promised to implement \"the toughest regulatory regime in Europe\" if elected. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry sec- retary, said: \"One test this gov- ernment has failed is to take action against the boardroom excesses of the privatised utili- ties.\" Conservatives, sought to regain some political ground at a press conference, accusing Labour of shying away from commitments to renationalise water, the national electricity grid and BT, formerly British Telecom. Mr Lilley said that at current share prices, Labour's plans would cost Â£10.5bn, although he later admitted that that would be lower if share prices were depressed by \"punitive\" regulation. The DTI argues that because utilities were privatised over a seven-year period, there are differences in regulators' for- mal powers. The planned bill will increase the power of Oftel and Ofgas, which control the tele- communication and gas indus- tries respectively, to the leiel of Offer, which supervises the electricity industry.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Ralph Atkins on what a hung parliament would mean for Ulster XCITEMENT over the impending general elec- tion is spreading beyond the UK mainland to infect Northern Ireland's politics - whetting appetites of Unionist MPs for whom a hung parlia- ment might offer a rare chance to wield real power. Fascination over the political alliances that could be forged if neither of the two biggest par- ties won a majority partly explains why attempts to revive talks on the province's political future have flagged. Compared with the Liberal Democrats' demands for consti- tutional reform, the conditions being publicly aired by some Unionist MPs appear superfi- cially modest. Yet precedent and present complexities make the formation of pacts an unen- viable task. With only 17 MPs in North- ern Ireland - one, Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein MP for West Belfast, does not take his seat - the risks in trying to appease a handful of MPs may outweigh the rewards. Stable government could hardly be guaranteed; Northern Ireland's MPs were crucial in bringing down the minority Labour gov- ernment of Mr James Cal- laghan in March 1979. So far, all scenarios are hypothetical. Neither Labour nor the Tories even acknowl- edges the possibility of any- thing other than outright vic- tory. The nine Ulster Unionist MPs are the largest grouping in the province. Headed by Mr James Molyneaux, a coy leader The risks in trying to appease a handful of MPs may outweigh the rewards who plays his cards close to his chest, they traditionally have strong links with the Conserva- tive party. By nature most are conservative with a small \"c\". Recently, however, that rela- tionship has soured. The hated 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement signed by Mrs Thatcher when Conservative leader, and the decision of local Tories to fight Westminster seats in the prov- ince, are but two grievances. The Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said: \"The instinct at this moment in Northern Ireland would have more empathy with the Labour party, with a cleaner record on Northern Ireland, than with a Tory party which had not yet repented of its sins.\" He cites the tenure of Mr Roy (now Lord) Mason as Northern Ireland secretary from 1976 to 1979 as a time when the government had \"a grip\" on security. Yet any pact by Labour with the Ulster Unionists would cost the votes of the three MPs from the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party - a sister socialist party. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, would lose his current North- ern Ireland spokesman, Mr Kevin McNamara, who firmly backs the official policy of eventual unification. Ulster Unionists' price for a post-election deal would centre on returning power to local politicians. Without a cross- party agreement on political structures in the province, that would, in effect, mean a return to the Unionist ascendancy. A Northern Ireland select committee to scrutinise the work of ministers, proper par- liamentary debate of legisla- tion affecting the province and a tougher stand against terror- ism would be minimum demands. To a Tory or Labour govern. ment seeking radical changes, a pact with the more cohesive 21 Liberal Democrat MPs sud- denly has greater appeal. In addition to the nine Ulster Unionist MPs there are possi- bly four other Unionist votes. Three are held by the Demo- cratic Unionist party of the vol- uble Rev Ian Paisley, whose obstinacy would make per- sonal relationships with main- land politicians difficult if not impossible. DUP preconditions are likely to be harsher than those of the Ulster Unionists. The Rev Wil- liam McCrea, the party's MP for Mid Ulster, said an end to constitutional uncertainty and a tough, uninhibited initiative against the IRA would be his demands. By character, the DUP would more naturally be wooed by the Tories, said Mr McCrea. The fourth non-UUP MP is Mr James Kilfedder, the mav- erick unionist MP for North Down. He has his own Ulster Popular Unionist Party and sits on the Conservative benches in the Commons. As far as is known, he has not yet been approached by either Mr Major or Mr Kin- nock.",

   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff THE RATE of decline in UK economic activity slackened in the second quarter of this year, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. Latest estimates of activity showed that gross domestic product fell by 0.6 per cent between the first and second quarters, after a provisional second-quarter estimate of 0.9 per cent. The latest revisions to the GDP series show a steady but gradual slowing in the rate of decline after the sudden 1.2 per cent, plunge into negative growth between the second and third quarters of last year, when business confidence was affected by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The economy has been con- tracting for four quarters, but the present trend suggests chances of a return to a small positive growth in the third quarter of 1991 as oil produc- tion in the North Sea recovers after a year of interruptions. On a year-on-year basis, GDP was 3.7 per cent lower in the second quarter, suggesting that the recession is slightly less deep than that of 1980-1. Economists regarded the flg- ures as largely historic and to some extent inconclusive. Mr Roger Bootle, economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: \"They don't point to recovery one way or the other.\" The detailed breakdown of economic activity in yester- day's figures included announcements that, compar- ing the second quarters of 1990 and 1991: * GDP at current market urices - money GDP - increased by 4 per cent; * The GDP deflator - a good barometer of domestically gen- erated inflation - increased by 6.7 per cent, after a 9.9 per cent peak in the third quarter of last year; 0 In volume terms, consumer expenditure was 1.7 per cent lower. Erratic oil production has exacerbated the recession in terms of the output figures. The GDP series that excludes oil fell by 3.2 per cent on an annual basis, less steeply than the index that includes oil.",

In the wake of yesterday's talks, the Home Office announced that 1992 was being designated Car Crime Preven- tion Year and would see a national campaign to cut car thefts, which is now running at a rate of about one every two minutes. Mr Baker called during the meeting for all manufacturers to fit deadlocks, which prevent a car's doors being opened in the absence of the key.

Mr Colin Railings and Mr Michael Thresher, directors of the elections centre at Plym- outh Polytechnic, say that the level is usually below 50 per cent. A Mori poll carried out for the Electoral Reform Society in August showed that voters favoured the introduction of PR for local government by more than three to one (50 per cent to 14 per cent). Using the present first-past- the-post electoral system pro- duces \"local authorities whose council composition bears, at best, a tenuous relationship to the party political preferences of their voters\", the report says.

According to the Central Sta- tistical Office, Britain had a seasonally adjusted surplus on manufictured goods of 1090m in the three months to August, compared with a defcit of lbn in the March-May period. It was the first surplus on that part of the trade account since &ate 192.

He said imports could be expected to clinb as Britain moved out of recession, raising doubts as to whether the surplus on factory-made items could be sstained& Certain types of manufac- tured imports have started to rise significantly in the past six months. Import volumes of chemicals rose 8.5 per cent in the June- August period, compared with the previous three months. For basic Industrial materials and capital goods, the increases were 6.5 per cent and 4 per cent respect y.

However, an indication of the depressed state of con- sumer demand is that there is i no evidence of any recovery in imports of general consumer goods. Volume imports of such items, which include a range of manufactured items for the home, saw a 5.5 per cent decline in the three months to August, compared with the March-May period. On a three- monthly basis, they are down 10 per cent on a year ago.

   "text_content" : "By John Hunt, Environment Correspondent LORD Crickhowell, chairman of the National Rivers Author- ity (NRA) will warn the prime minister today against break- ing up the pollution watchdog. Lord Crickhowell, formerly Mr Nicholas Edwards, Welsh secretary in Mrs Thatcher's government, has been offered the chairmanship of the new environmental protection agency that Mr Major proposes to establish. Lord Crickhowell is said to be considering the offer. He is said to find the original proposal for the new agency unacceptable because it would involve breaking up the NRA. He will tell the prime minis- ter that the various functions of the NRA are indivisible and that leaving them together makes political and environ- mental sense. Mr Major has proposed that the pollution control functions of the NRA should be taken over by the new agency. The proposed new agency would also include the Pollution Inspectorate, the Water Inspec- torate and the waste regula- tory functions of local authori- ties. That would leave many functions such as fisheries, navigation and drainage to be controlled by what remained of the NRA."

This is the latest move by the government to establish its \"green\" credentials with the approach of a general election. Departments will have to put money values on any destruc- tion of the environment that may result from government policies. That will enable the impact on the environment to be ana- lysed alongside the policy's other costs and benefits. People whose environment is threatened by a new policy will be asked whether they are will- ing to pay the additional costs necessary to avoid the damage or to accept compensation for' environmental deterioration. Government departments that have been slow to adapt to the increased public pressure on the environment will have to improve their performance. Mr David Trippier, environ- ment minister, said yesterday that Britain was the first coun- try in the world to inaugurate such a scheme, although Can- ada is expected to do so soon.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By John Wlilman THE TESTS that seven- year-olds will have to take in 1992 are to be shorter and focused more on basic skills, Mr Kenneth Clarke,.the educa- tion secretary, announced yes- terday. Tihe-consuming and unman- ageable tests of applied skills in maths and science will be dropped. The reading test will be more finely graded, with five grades rather than three. A more demanding test will be added to stretch the most able children. It will provide four levels of attainment that children can achieve, com- pared with three this year. Mr Clarke said: \"This will cut the burden on teachers substantially and give parents more useful information about their child's progress.\" The announcement follows a review of the standard assess- ment tests (Sats), first used in schools in England and Wales in April of this year. The Sats, introduced as part of the gov- ernment's educational reforms, were criticised for their com- plexity.* Mr Jdohn Major; the .primne minister, appeared to endorse such criticism 'when he called for simpler \"pencil and paper\" tests that allowed whole classes to be assessed simultaneously. The new testing programme has been drawn up by the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council, under its chairman, Lord Griffiths, a for- mer adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. The changes to tests for seven-year-olds aim to make them more manageable and to emphasise reading, writ- ing and arithmetic. The number of attainment targets to be achieved by for- mal testing will be cut from nine to seven, with the other two being tested .through teacher assessment. \"' Some of the tests can be adminIstered to groups, rather than on a timne-consuming, one-to-one basis. Lord Griffiths expects them to take less than 30 hours to administer for each- class, compared with an aver- age of 44 hours for the 1991 tests. He defended the tests against critics such as the National Union of Teachers, which advo- cated teacher assessment instead of tests. He said Sats had given teachers more infor- mation about children than they had expected. Mr Clarke said he hoped local authorities would publish the results of next year's tests on a school-by-school basis. The public interest in informa- tion comparing, school exam results was \"almost insatia- ble\", he said."

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor BRITISH WOMEN feel that they are patronised by the financial services industry, according to a survey by Min- tel International Group, pub- lished yesterday. Sixty per cent of women interviewed agreed with the statement that \"financial com- panies talk down to women because they think women are not capable of understanding money\". Those most likely to feel that they were being patronised were housewives and those in the 35-54 age group. In addi- tion, 73 per cent endorsed the view that \"financial advertis- ing does not explain what's on offer clearly enough\". Sixty per cent favoured the idea of prod. ucts aimed specifically at females. Mintel found that more than half of those interviewed adhered to the traditional belief that long-term financial decisions should be left to men, while women run the day-today finances. Nevertheless, Mintel argues that women still have influ- ence over many financial deci- sions. The survey found that they had substantial influence when couples chose store cards, credit cards and current accounts. But they had much less influence in the choice of car insurance, private medical insurance and pensions. The survey compilers inter- viewed 1,154 women. Women and Finance 1991.

The board calls on the gov- ernment to adopt the informal mechanism for co-ordinating multi-party actions which hai been developed In recent years by solicitors and the courts In cases such as the tranquilliser addiction claims and the Opren case. The board proposes that in future it should enter into a contract with the firm or lead firms co-ordinating the claims to carry out the work that is common to all the claims. Once the contract is made, legal aid for such generic work will be available only to the contracting firms. Individual claimants will remain free to choose their own solicitor to do work specific to their case. Those special arrangements will only come into effect if: * the relevant group includes not fewer than 10 claimants who have been granted legal aid; * the claims involve common issues of fact or law arising from the same event or cause; * the claims are sufficiently complex in terms of assem- bling statements, undertaking research, obtaining expert evi- dence and processing large volumes of material; * using the special arrange- ments would benefit some or all of the claimants. In selecting the lead firms, the board will ask for propos- als from the firms on how they intend to co-ordinate and pro- ceed with the action. If it is not satisfied, it may ask other firms to submit proposals. Lead firms will be required to keep both the board and claimants informed of prog- ress.

   "text_content" : "Michiyo Nakamoto on Gestetner's Japanese link HE argument that large is beautiful is an increasingly powerful one in the European photo- copier market and one that was given a further nod by the tie-up between Ricoh and Ges- L tetner announced last Friday. The strategic alliance between the Japanese and Brit- ish groups not only comes in the wake of several failures among smaller photocopier dis- tributors, but it also heralds the likelihood of further con- solidation in the sector. Photocopier distribution is already being increasingly con- solidated in the hands of a number of large concerns, Ges- tetner being the largest inde- pendent one. In a highly fragmented mar- ket, those which distribute equipment under the manufac- turer's label comprise about 72 per cent of the European mar- ket. Those which market private-label equipment, com- monly known as own-equip- ment manufacturers, account for the remaining 28 per cent. Gestetner has about 28 per cent of the private-label sector and is poised to expand after being further strengthened by the capital injection from Ricoh. In its expansionary intentions, Gestetner is follow- ing an industry trend that has seen distributors such as Erskine House and Eurocopy build up their operations through strategic acquisitions. Their moves have been encouraged by the weakness of smaller distributors that lack the capital strength nec- essary to survive a recession. Mr Greg Melgaard, Gestet- ner's deputy chairman, says: \"The day of the smaller inde- pendent dealer is coming to an end.\" The industry shake-out should be accelerated by tech- nological advances. The spread of the new technology means that dealers will need to invest in costly front-end technology. \"This will add an incentive for dealers to consolidate,\" Mr Melgaard says. Ricoh's decision to take a stake in Gestetner as a means to strengthen its position in Europe does not reflect well on prospects for smaller distributors. Ricoh is the dominant com- pany in its own domestic mar- ket with a 32 per cent market share, but it has been slow to expand in Europe. The Japanese company's European efforts have been thwarted recently by a number of failures among photocopier distributors. That has been a costly experience for Ricoh. Given its need to catch up with other Japanese manufac- turers that have been quick to position themselves in the European market before 1992, it makes sense for Ricoh to strengthen its relationship with a leading distributor that can provide it with the geo- graphic reach in sales and economies of scale attained by its competitors. A leading office equipment distributor warned that Ricoh might be planning to shed an additional number of smaller dealers. The move to tie up with larger distributors might be followed by other photocopier manufacturers that have no extensive dealer network in Europe yet. Not all independent dealers are going to suffer from the trend. There are some with a strong presence in their regional market. The question is whether those distributors have the strength to survive what prom- ises to be tough times for the independents. \"The pressure is going to be on in a number of areas,\" says one distributor. \"Manufactur- ers are increasingly going to want to deal with dealers who pay.\"",

   "text_content" : "By David Boggis and John Falding Last survivor: The sole airworthy Short Sunderland, pictured over London's Docklands \\ A SUNDERLAND flying boat built by Shorts in Belfast in 1944 comes under the hammer today in a Sotheby's sale of his- toric aircraft and aeronautica. It is believed to be the only one left in flying condition. The auctioneers believe this is the first time a Sunderland has been sold at auc- tion. They know of only seven such air- craft in existence: the other six are in museums throughout the world. Its estimated price is between Â£450,000 and Â£550,000. Mr Steve Maycock of Soth- eby's said the auctioneers expected bid- ders to include museums, and also private individuals hoping to use the aircraft com- mercially for luxury tourist flights. He said: \"I envisage something like the Orient Express.\" Mr Allan Winn, editor of Flight Interna- tional, said: \"This is the last survivor of the golden age of flying boats. What makes this so exceptional is that it is airworthy. It is the only one of 700 Sunderlands built which is still in flying condition. Whoever buys it will need to be a wealthy enthusi- ast with vast resources to maintain it. But no one will pay out that kind of money if they are not going to fly it.\" Mr Winn said a deal with Ryanair, which would have allowed the Sunderland to fly in Ireland, had fallen through last year. Sunderlands were built as coastal pro- tection aircraft for the RAF and formed part of Britain's submarine defences dur- ing the Second World War. They were christened \"Flying Porcupines\" by the Germans because of their bristling arma- ments. One of their most dramatic roles came when they took part in the Berlin airlift because they could operate from Berlin's lakes. The aircraft at Sotheby's was bought by Mr Edward Hulton in 1979, who restored it to flying condition. A buyer will have a problem, apart from the drain on his bank balance. There are not too many pilots licensed to fly four-en- gined flying boats.",

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff FORD, the vehicle manus- acturer, looks unlikely to be able to obtain union agreement this year to sweeping changes in the outdated pay and grad- ing structure for its 29,000 blue- collar workers in the UK. According to unions, Ford management is objecting to the cost of union proposals put for- ward to a joint working party. The union plan would add an estimated 5 per cent to the pay bill in the first year of opera- tion. It is believed that Ford wants the restructuring to be completely, or at least nearly, self-financing. Proposals for radical reform in working practices put for- ward by Rover Group to its workforce last week will put extra pressure on Ford's man- agement. Rover's plan, which is part of its drive to meet increasing competition from Japanese car plants in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, is being considered by unions. At Ford, both management and unions agreed nearly two years ago that reform of the existing pay and grading struc- ture was long overdue. The intention was for a joint work- ing party to agree an alterna- tive pay structure before the current two-year pay agree- ment ended on November 24. With less than two months to go, Ford management agreed yesterday that time was short but said it was prema-, ture to talk of negotiations having broken down. The current structure, which has been in place since the late 1960s, consists of five grades and 52 job titles. The number EMPLOYMENT of job titles was reduced in 1985 from more than 500. Man- agement preference is believed to be for two grades, while unions want three. Separately from the regrad- ing talks, unions are gearing up to put in a pay claim. Man- agement is due to meet unions to discuss the claim on October 14. This year's talks will be against the background of Ford's disclosure in May that it had plunged into loss for the first time in 20 years. Employees did particularly well last year out of the second year of an inflation-linked deal which gave a rise of 13.4 per cent.",

BBC management said it would implement the terms on October 5, after talks broke down yesterday at Acas, the conciliation service. Industrial action might affect BBC cover- age of the Conservative party conference. The proposal - which has been under discussion all year and was rejected in a ballot by some groups in the BBC in the summer - will mean that staff will have to work more flexible hours. They will lose some extra allowances, described by the BBC as \"antiquated\", in return for an additional 5 per cent increase in pay this year. BBC management said yes- terday it regretted that it was unable to resolve differences with the unions involved.

In July, the base pay of senior directors was 14.8 per cent higher than a year ear- lier, while total earnings, which take into account bonus payments, were nearly 15 per cent higher. In July 1990, top directors' pay was rising at an annual rate of around 18 per cent, while total earnings were up by 12.5 per cent. The average salary of chief executives who manage com- panies with a turnover of Â£500m to Â£1.2bn was Â£196,500, up 18.9 per cent. Bonus pay- ments were, however, sharpl lower: total pay rose 3.9 per cent to Â£207,850 from â¬200,000 a year ago. Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt, a director of Monks, said he was surprised by the continuing rise in top managers' pay. He said that most of the pay rises were determined in late 1990 and that as the recession con- tinues he expected to see more modest rises. He said that the exceptional increases for some directors, which might seem anomalous, might be a result of the reces. sion. \"As the less able are weeded out, those who have proved their worth by maintaining profitability tend to receive exceptional increases,\" Mr Vernon-Harcourt said. Top directors were most affected by reduced bonuses. Only 54 per cent of top man- gers eligible for bonuses actu- ally received them, compared with 64 per cent a year ago. Company cars remained the managers' main perk in 1991. Among top directors 95 per cent receive a car and 88 per cent receive petrol. Some 18 per cent of top directors have two company cars.

   "text_content" : "Richard Tomkins finds widespread eagerness to quit the public sector I/ RE some of Britain's =bicst ort about to victim to preda- tors? Thei question has intrigued the ports industry for months. Soon the suspense will be -over: the moment has arrived for the predators to swoop. The reason for the ports' sudden vulnerability is the pas- sage of the Ports Act in July. That paved the way for privati- sation of the so-called trust ports, more than 100 of which were set up under individual statute a century or more ago, and owned by self-governing trusts. The act gives the govern- ment the power to force the privatisation of the 15 or so biggest trust ports - defined as those with annual turnover of Â£5m or more - if they do not volunteer for privatisation in the next two years. Some of the more entrepre- neurial trust ports are not waiting to be shoved. In the past few weeks, the Tees & Hartlepool Port Authority has put its port on the market, and the authorities owning three others - Medway in Kent, Clyde in Scotland, and Tilbury near London - have said that they are about to follow suit. Such eagerness to privatise is easily explained. Two years ago, the profits potential of Britain's ports industry was transformed by the govern- ment's abolition of the restric- tive working practices enshrined in the Dock Labour Scheme. But the trust ports have remained hamstrung by legislation that restricts their borrowing powers and pre- vents diversification. Once in the private sector, the trust ports should flourish. One factor all the privatisa- tion schemes have in common, therefore, is that they have been mooted as management/ employee buy-outs. While the government has indicated that it will give a certain degree of preference to the buy-out teams, the Ports Act insists that all sales must be subject to competitive tender. That is where the predators come in. There is near-univer- sal agreement in the ports industry that the buy-out teams are going to face tough competition from outsiders. What remains to be seen is who those outsiders will be. The most hotly tipped con tenders are: 0 NFC and Ocean Group, two of Britain's biggest freight dis- tribution and shipping groups. Ports are a vital link in the transport chain; both compa- nies are already extensive port users; and either could present the acquisition of one or more ports as a natural extension of its transport activities. * Associated British Ports. Britain's biggest ports group after privatisation in 1983, it is against hostile bidding but says it may join a competitive tender if the port is right. It does not need Tees and Hartle- pool because it is well repre- sented in the north, but Med- way would fill a gap in the south-east. * Marine Transport Services, owner of the Thamesport ter- minal on the Isle of Grain. Formed through a manage- ment buy-out of Mr Peter de Savary's Thames Estuary Ter- minals, it is heavily borrowed. Acquisition of one of the cash- rich trust ports may prove an attractive means of expansion. * P&O has expressed a strong interest in the trust port of Dover, where its main cross- Channel operations are based. It looks an unlikely candidate for other port acquisitions after its disposal of the port of Felixstowe to Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong last June. * Overseas ports interests. UK ports are beginning to attract attention from over- seas, as indicated by Hutchison Whampoa's purchase of Felix- stowe. A similar move may be planned by Modern Terminals, Hutchison Whampoa's main rival in Hong Kong, although Modern Terminals says it has no immediate plans for UK acquisitions. * Property companies.

   "text_content" : "By John Thomhill THE END of the recession will bring little relief for hard- ressed retailers because ris- ing costs will continue to erode margins over the next few years, according to a report from Verdict Research, the retail consultancy. The study suggests that in the coming year the cost of occupying a retail outlet will rise by about 9 per cent, or twice the projected rate of sales growth. The introduction of the uni- form business rate has added significantly to many retailers' costs. On average, a big multi- ple will face an annual increase in its rates bill of about 15 per cent over the next four years. Rising rent levels - still reflecting the buoyant levels of demand of the late 1980s - and rising wages have also put pressure on occu- pancy costs. Lower projected sales levels will hamper retailers' efforts to restore margins. Even after the recession is over, Verdict expects retail sales to climb at a far slower rate than in the late 1980s. The study estimates that total retail sales grew by 47 per cent between 1985 and 1990 to reach Â£129bn. By 1990 it expects sales to rise a fur- ther 32 per cent to Â£170bn. Stripped of the effects of forecast inflation, sales are expected to grow at a rate of 8 per cent between 1990 and 1995 compared with the 20 per cent growth in the second half of the 1980s. Verdict suggests that the successful retailers of the 1990s will have to combine rig- orous cost management con- trols with more sophisticated retailing skills. The report predicts that sales will recover at very dif- ferent levels in different sec- tors of the high street. Electri- cal retailers, grocers, Do It Yourself retailers, sports shops and variety stores are all expected to show good volume gains in coming years. Furni- ture stores and home shopping companies will continue to experience declines. Verdict on Retailing. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London. WC1V 6S. Â£950.",

Earning high marks from both the IMF and OECD, the performance of the Belgian debt management has been all the more impressive, given the sharp swing from a primary deficit to a primary surplus of 5%.

   "text_content" : "Khozem Merchant reports on the Asian approachto fifi4 bit s hen Allahditta Rauf first visited his bank manager to ask for a business loan, he went armed with only a broad smile. He left empty-handed, his smile swiftly removed by the manager's peremp- tory but polite refusal. Rauf and other Asian business- men say the UK clearers have much to answer for. Why do banks, faced with a perfectly reasonable business idea, simply refuse to provide funds, they ask? The most common reasons, say bankers, are the lack of collateral and the absence of a track record. To which, the Asians counter, Brit- ish bankers fail to grasp their way of doing business. But now, the position may be changing. NatWest was among sev- eral UK high street banks which acted quickly to attract Asian busi- nesses hit by the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. John Hackwood, business devel- opment manager at NatWest, says: \"As a community they are proud not to get a name as bad debtors. If you get a good name with them, they come back - we try to culti- vate this.\" The BCCI closure brought into sharp focus the reason so many Asians were forced to turn to \"home country\" banks; Asians say business can be discussed in the indigenous language, free of the for- mality typical in a mainstream Brit- ish bank. Several factors - notably the availability of relatives to work, often cheaply, in the business - carry weight when determining cre- ditworthiness with banks such as Habib Bank, a Pakistani bank with branches in the UK, but are dis- missed as irrelevant by UK banks. Thrift, prudence and self-reliance, underpinned by a strong family role, have proved the enduring rea- Sons behind Asians' commercial success - witness any inner city high street. The family influence is felt most strongly in two areas. First, it provides relatively cheap and flexible labour. By employing only family members, wage caots can be held down. A business can stay open for long and unsocial hours. \"When I told the bank that my relatives would help in the business they just did not understand. But this is how we work. Without my family nothing would have hap- pened,\" says Rauf, whose textile company Polyfashion, based in Small Heath, Birmingham, employs 50 people, including seven members of his family. Second, the family network is a cheap source of start-up finance, Ygiven on trust. Kiran Patel, whose family owns four shops in London, bought his first newsagents shop jointly with his father with family savings and money he had saved from a part-time job. Rauf launched his first business,. an import venture, with money deposited with him by friends and relatives in Pakistan. However, the family role does have its drawbacks. 0 The size of a family can itself determine growth. In retailing, for. instance, a family owning several shops usually insists on a close rela- tive running each shop. \"When businesses run out of brothers they often cease to expand. Trust is fun- damental,\" says Suhail Aziz, a man- agement consultant who operates under the DTI's Enterprise Initia- tive. * With big, family-owned com- panies, decision-making is focused around the founder or core family group. Such a top-heavy manage- ment structure, says Aziz, impedes introduction of broadly-based, though still informal, management that could survive the owner- founder. . Most of these imas remain uvately owned. By retaining undi- ated family ownership, and resist- In& for example, stock market flota- tion, theyforego the benefits of a uiblic listing, such as access to cap- ital. Flotation implies public dis- closures and accountability, charac- teristics which fly 'in the face of many Asian-owned businesses' obsession with confidentiality. * Family-owned businesses fre- quently appoint eager but inexperi- enced close relatives to senior posts. Paradoxically, their reluctance to instal properly qualified non-family management, often deters the very recruits they seek to attract - young Asian professionals. Asian entrepreneurship is concen- trated in two areas: the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector embracing both retail and whole- sale activity such as DIY, groceries, wines and spirits, newsagents and textiles. There are few barriers to entry; minimal initial Investment, technology or skilled' labour is required. Looking at the FMCG sector, Mars, the UK confectionery maker, in a joint survey with the magazine Asian Trader, says Asians own 95 per cent of all independently owned shops (excluding multiples) within the area ringed by the M25 in south- east England. Nationally, the figure is 65 per cent. And 78 per cent of the independent retail sector is con- trolled by Gujaratis from west India, who migrated to east Africa before settling in Britain in the early 1970s. Typically, many of these families bought their first shop and then expanded by buying the premises next door. This has obvious attrac- tions; economies of scale from bulk- buying can produce savings and owners can exert tight control, espe- - A- __ - - A-- _ _ ciallyj If they. employ non-family staff The needi maintali tiht1 control over his slowly expendin retail business presented Kiran Patel with his biggest problem to date; he has run out of relatives to whom he can entrust the running.of SWithout the familyit is very di ficult. \"Certainly, my parents' retirement - they look after one of our shops --could force the biggest change of direction for us.\" Patel was forced to- turn to the high street banks when considering expansion. \"I had been turned down by NatWest when starting the busi- ness but the same branch eventu- ally offered me overdraft facilities and then loans to purchase the new shops.\" It is in this first stage of expansion that Asian-owned busi- nesses often encounter problems. \"Many small, growing businesses encounter problems because they are required to conform to conven- tional business practices,\" says Susan Marlow, of Warwick Business School and the author of a report on small Asian businesses. \"They need to produce business plans which many are unable to do. There may be employment prob- lems because as a growing concern they might need to instal high-tech equipment or take on skilled labour. And the cost of capital - if they get it - from an institution can also be prohibitive for a business which has raised money from a family net- work. The costs of growth force them to remain on the periphery.\" These factors have forced Poly- fashion, for example, to finance its expansion - it now sells to the big high street retailers - primarily by ploughing profits back into the business. Today, the biggest challenge sac- ing Mohammed Rauf, son of the founder of Polyfashion and now its driving force, is how to manage TRI family FUSC pMM IwUSUI Ufl vIulnnlUI profl ion) wnn lion rwugnrm) ar. gnu amugnur Jaumld, PIg, KMan and Surundra growth. He is toying with the radi- cal idea of employing outside experts, a move he fears could divide his family. \"My family would be offended if an outsider gave orders. But we can only grow fur- ther if we have a fresh expert input,\" he says. Yet Asian businesses have gener- ally kept clear of the consultancy industry - both private and gov- ernment-backed. This is partly due to their ignorance of what is avail- able and of how best to exploit those channels. In Bradford, for instance, the bulk of Asian businesses are small retail shops. That, says John Calvert, chief executive of Bradford and Dis- trict Tec, means many are not suit- able candidates for the kind of busi- ness support services the Tec offers, which is designed to encourage growth. \"One of the key features of our advice service would be to encour- age business to expand and diver- sify. But Asian-owned shops in Bradford do not want that because many merely want to serve their local community, rather than expand. They are content to carry on as they are.\" In any event, many Asian busi- nessmen feel they know their busi- ness well enough and as own- er/managers, with only limited time, their concerns are with solv- ing problems, not anticipating them, says Marlow. That attitude of self-help has, for example, been characteristic of the five Wouhra brothers who run Bir- mingham-based East End Foods, a Â£20m a year turnover cash and carry group. As T.S. Wouhra, chair- man, says: \"In management, we pre- ser to learn and use our own skills.\" By contrast, Lornamead, a Lon- don-based cosmetics and foods mar- keting company owned by the four Jatania brothers, sees itself as being slightly different. It has appointed an increasing number of non-Jatan- las (and non-Asians) in senior posts, including two onto the board. The company, whose own brand name products are sold at Boots, has been forced by its rapid expan- sion to buy in those skills its found- ers lacked. Those skills have reflected the nature of its growth in branded goods, marketing and advertising - an uncommon area of activity for Asians. \"If we do not have the expertise, then we buy it,\" says chief executive Mitesh Jatania. \"What we try to do is differenti- ate between leadership and manage- ment. To grow, the founders must delegate to middle management, and then motivate them.\"",

   "text_content" : "K iran Patel's four shops in south London repre- sent the archetypical Asian business. The business got off the ground with family savings and is run by the fam- ily working 15-hour days. Yet, paradoxically, the fam- ily is Patel's biggest hin- drance. For he has run out of relatives, without whom he is reluctant to expand. \"We are in a dilemma,\" says Patel, 36, who with his wife runs a drycleaners. His parents - who manage a newsagents - will retire in two years. Patel's brother runs another newsagents. The busi- ness turns over a total of Â£13,000 a week. The choice facing the family is clear: keep the business small and wholly family-man- aged or expand and lose the tight control they so cherish. They have tentatively opted for the latter; the family's sec- ond drycleaners is run by a non-family employee. Ultimately, Patel's parents' retirement will probably force him to sell the newsagents and concentrate on expanding the drycleaners, possibly through a partnership with someone from his own community. 1 Patel foresees many benefits in the change of direction. 1 Running a newsagents I involves working long hours i and includes heavy work such 1 as lifting and unpacking i boxes. But in drycleaning, 1 there are high margins, more I socal hours and the work is i easy. \"The hard work has given me my Independence. I It's been worth it,\" he says. Patel trained as an accoun- tant. But after a year he quit 1 in 1974 to join his father and 1 bought the two newsagents. They put in Â£13,000 from faunm- ly savings and raised Â£11,000 from BCCI. NatWest had turned them down, saying they lacked business experi- ence. But business proved brisk and having repaid the loan, they expanded, buying their first drycleaners. This was followed by three snap purchases, a vppt office and two newsagent:. \"The opportunities came out of the blue and I had to act quickly. Later I received good offers so we sold.\" The deals were funded by loans from NatWest, which was by now convinced by their business ability, and profits from the core business. Loans were repaid from the sale proceeds. \"We do not like debts hanging over us,\" says Patel. All the deals were by word of mouth, involving another Patel (a common surname meaning landowner) from the same mlndu community. One of the purchases was initiated by the biggest Patel of all - Chandrakant Patel, whose Capital Newsagents group controls some 300 shops in Britain.",

   "text_content" : "itesh Jatania, 26, is a young man in a hurry. Lornamead, a foods, wines, spirits and cos- metics marketing company, is the vehicle for his, and his three brothers' ambitions. Set up in 1978 as an export house selling fast-moving consumer goods to west Africa, today it exports its branded goods worldwide and has an annual turnover of some Â£14m. \"Nigeria was a cash cow for. us,\" says Jatania, Lornamead's chief executive. The experi- ence of working in Nigeria also provided a crash course in business management. The brothers - born in Uganda but living in Britain since the late 1960s - learned quickly. Lornamead expanded into branded goods, selling its own lines of cheap foods and wines and personal care prod- ucts. The manufacture and packaging of the goods were sub-contracted. The sourcing, research and marketing was the brothers' work. Heavily dependent on the Afro-Caribbean markets and with a narrow line of ethnic products, Lornamead diversi- fied, into Britain. Again branded goods were seen as the way to diversify. \"Celsius\", a range of men's personal care products, was the result. Lornamead spent Â£250,000 on developing the \"Celsius concept\", Â£150,000 on the press launch (for which Jatania took public speaking lessons) and Â£1.5m on adver- tising. The biggest break- through was securing distribu- tion through Boots' last year. \"It was a real coup for us,\" says Jatania.",

   "text_content" : "In the final article of a series looking at public spending on research and development throughout the world, Quentin Peel describes how the unification of Germany has forced the government to reassess its priorities Heinz Riesenhuber, for almost a decade now Germany's minister of research and technology, has always been a staunch believer in his government's hefty participa- tion in the European space pro- gramme. It has been a belief that has cost him relatively dear. For the great prestige projects of the European Space Agency - the Ariane rocket system, the Hermes space shuttle, Colum- bus space station - as well as the Singer hypersonic space transporter, have in recent years absorbed almost the entire annual increase in his research budget. Today Riesenhuber is under pressure as never before to reassess the cost of Germany's participation in the European manned space programme. He is urgently trying to find a middle way between the demands of his own colleagues on the benches of the German Bundestag, and his long-term commitment, above all to France, in the pursuit of an independent European technol- ogy to put men in space. The immediate reason for his agony is the unification of Ger- many. For that tumultuous event, thanks to the massive financial burden of promoting recovery in the regions of the former German Democratic Republic, has called into ques- tion every aspect of govern- ment spending. As far as the stateresearch budget is con- crned, it has caused a belated recognition of the need for an ursept assement of ppriorities. It is notsbimply the general budget pressure which has caused the rethink. For the very process of unification has put a major new burden on research spending tsel, as the Ministry headed by Riesen- huber is called on to pay for the cost of tranaorming the overmanned, ideologically-con- trolled and ill-organised east German scientific establish- ment into an Internationally- competitive system on a par with. that in the WestL That is not to say that Ri- senhuber, who boasts a perma- nent look of somewhat owlish surprise, has been enjoying a quiet life since he was pro- moted into the German Cabi- net as its youngest member back in 1982. In spite of the fact that German R&D has always been the object of considerable international envy, at least for the sheer wealth of its resources, the minister has already presided over a sub- stantial overhaul. Ever since he came to office, Riesenhub- er's stated ambition has been to inject more market-oriented realism into the cosy laborato- ries of Germany's great research establishments. \"More than ever before in German research policy, the government is trying to minim- ise its intervention in our industrial R&D system, to stimulate technological innova- tions by schemes limited in time and the amount of funds, to strengthen ties between research in the public sector and innovation in the private sector, and to respect the free- dom and self-responsibility of our science communities,\" according to Josef Rembser, director general for basic research of the Ministry of Research and Technology. That has been done in part by cutting back sharply on public funding for research in big industrial enterprises, and switching the emphasis far more to basic research in the big scientific institutes. More recently, the stress has been on promoting innovation in small and medium enterprises - the Mittelstand which forms the backbone of German industry. Between 1982 and 1990 cen- tral government finance for industrial research projects, especially in large firms, was cut back by half, from DM3.245bn (Â£1.1bn) to DM1.656bn. Instead, the prior- ity has gone to research in two new areas: to key technologies of perceived German weakness, like information technology, biotechnology, laser and mate- rials research, and to the politi- cally popular field of socalled preventive research, including the environment, waste dis- posal, health and medical research, climatic research and recycling. The Ministry of Research and Technology is responsible for rather more than half of all federal government spending on R&D. Although the Under governments are also a major source of finance in the federal system, the fact that theirs is OI~~LUÂ· U~ ~C U10Â· URY~ ~ ~YLIIYIIÂ·~Â· ~I)YYÂ·I~O~ Â·RHIY~Â·IÂ·lslWÂ· ~YY-YVÂ· ~YLR~ often matching finance gives the central ministry a strong influence in determining the overall priorities. On the other hand, the two areas of space and defence research have been growing inexorably within the central government budget. The Defence Ministry, for example, was last year responsible for more than 22 per cent of cen- trally-funded research spend- ing, compared with only 16 per cent in 1980. The space budget (excluding hypersonic travel) is set to reach DM1.57bn next year, in a total Research Minis- try budget of DM9.25bn. Now on top of that comes the cost of unification. Riesen- huber has managed to negoti- ate for himself a 9.7 per cent increase in his 1992 budget (against DM4Sb8m in the pres- ant year), but DM1.6b o the total must now be dedicated to the \"new BundeslAnder\" in the east. The result is a freeze in the budgets for the big research centres of the west, which may well result in a cut n some of their programmes. Unlike the UK, where the great bulk of research is still carried out within the universi- ties, public R&D in Germany is dominated by semi-indepen- dent research institutes, like the myriad offshoots of the Max Planck Society, the Fraun- hofer Institutes, and the 13 big research centres. In July, the state Science Council completed a compre- hensive survey of all the off- shoots of the Soviet-inspired East German Academy of Sci- ences. It concluded that more than 40 research institutes should be maintained, which either complement research in the west, or are opening up new areas. In particular, according to Riesenhuber, blo- technology, some areas of physics, and medical research were strong. Other competitive areas include oceanography and optics (both of which clear military uses to the for- mer GDR). Some DM585m of the DM16bn for the past next year will go oh the copstruc- tion and development of new research institutes, Ironically, one of the conclu- salons of the Science Council is that research in the former GDR should be much more integrated into the higher edu- cationsystem and not sepa- rated into non-university cen- tres. That has also tended to be one of the criticisms of western German research. In spite of its relatively posi- tive conclusions about the amount of eastern research which can be usefully main- tained, the Science Council rec- ommends that only some 8,300 jobs be recreated in non-uni- versity institutes, and another 1,700 in universities, reducing by half the estimated 20,000 workers still on the payroll of the former Academy of Sci- ences. The spending drain in the east, and the redoubled empha- sis that the polluted and decayed environment of those regions puts on environmental research, has inevitably focused attention on the bi gst single item in the research budget - space. The estimate is already a 12.4 per cent increase over the present year. That is in spite of a commit- ment to renegotiate German contributions at the meeting of European Space Agency part- ners at Munich in November. \"German participation in the ESA projects Hermes and Col- umbus will only be possible with significant (cost) reduc- tions,\" according to the research ministry in Bonn. \"This demands difficult deci- sions with our European part- ners in the coming months.\" Riesenhuber has announced thathe wants a 20 per cent cut in ESA long-term costs, and is proposing a three-year \"provi- sional programme\" for Hermes to reassess its feasibility. In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel in August, he admitted that he was at least DM4bn short of cash to finance the space programme up to the year 2000, even provided there was absolutely no further over- run in costs. \"I do not see any possibility of ending Hermes through a unilateral German decision,\" he said. \"If we drop Hermes, then Paris might reconsider its participation in Colum- bus . . . European space co-operation is a very good thing in itself. If we endanger this even before the negotia- tions in November, we would be making an elementary polit- ical mistake.\" Yet Riesenhuber is clearly under pressure, and he knows it. He admits that the scientific returns from manned space flight may be modest. On the other hand, he says that two- thirds of the ESA programme is concerned with unmanned space flight, which should not be affected. Whatever he finally decides to do about the space pro- gramme - and it may well get caught up in the wider political negotiations about European political and monetary union, coming to a head in December - Riesenhuber is also likely to be under pressure to prove he is getting real value for money from the rest of his research budget as well Which almost certainly means that the costs of unification will be felt throughout the German west- ern research establishment, at least until the east can catch up.

   "text_content" : "By Steven Butler uJ usww When I knew that I was to move to Tokyo, it seemed best to wait before deciding on the hi-fl sys- tem that I had been planning to buy for many years. Japan, after all, is where they make the stuff and I had read that consumer electronics equipment is about 30 per cent cheaper in Tokyo than London. And wasn't Akihabara, Tokyo's crowded and noisy dis- count electronics district, the place to buy anything made in Japan at rock-bottom prices? It has not been so easy as that. I listen to mainly classi- cal - which more than many other types of music requires high-fidelity reproduction that does not distort the music - so I should have taken a warning when I picked up a few con- sumer magazines in London. Many Japanese amplifiers, CD players, and cassette decks were well rated, aside from the odd aspersions over the excess of buttons and control knobs that did little other than con- fuse. But surely that was just snobbery, and anyway, I had seen that Pioneer was produc- ing highly-rated amplifiers that were stripped down to the utmost simplicity. However, there was a surprising lack of reviews of Japanese speakers. But classical music is popu- lar in Japan too, so surely there must be something of high quality on offer. Indeed there is, I discovered, after a day trekking from store to store in Akihabara. It comes from Britain, and it is twice as expensive as in London. I started the day at Yamag- iwa, a large store that has something like a listening room that would be common in almost any hi-fi store in the west. There was a display of imported miniature speakers that were pumping out deli- ciously delicate sounds. But I wasn't yet prepared to pay Â£1,000 or more for a pair - enough to fund the cost of a shopping expedition in the US, let alone Hong Kong. I gave up instantly at the room which displayed Japa- nese-made speakers because it was impossible to hook them up to the amplifier and periph- erals I was interested in. They were only connected to equip- ment that was outside my bud- get. Elsewhere I could not find TECHNICALLY SPEAKING the Pioneer amplifier I was looking for. Pioneer's top-range amplifi- ers for Japan are designed as audio-video control centres, containing buttons and dials that I did not want. Nearly all stores only sell equipment made for the Japanese market which is loaded with techni- cally interesting but musically unnecessary gizmos. I eventually found a Pioneer export model with a button to cut out the gizmo circuits, but when I tried to listen to the amplifier on Yamaha speakers I was drowned out by some- body playing rap music on a ghetto blaster in the next aisle. Even despite that, the sound was noticeably more pure with the circuits cut out. Slowly it dawned on me: it is not possi- ble in Tokyo to hook up and have a listening test for ordi- nary stereo equipment, the sort that I presume most Japanese have in their living rooms. Jap- anese consumers are buying the equipment on spec, on manufacturers' reputation, and on reviews they read in maga- zines. Ears are not the final arbiter. What are the engineers doing? I recalled going to a demonstration of a new audio product at one large manufac- turer. No one seemed to notice that the in-house speakers pro- duced distortions and muddy sound through the mid and bass range. The engineers appeared so enthralled by the technical wizardry of it all that the final goal of pure music reproduction was missed. I finished the day back at Yamagiwa where I sought a salesman's advice on which Japanese speakers were best. He shook his head: \"For classi- cal music you really ought to buy imported speakers,\" he concluded. OF"

   "text_content" : "William Packer visits two sculpture exhibitions 'Numbers of Word Arrived', 1991 by Katsura Funa- koshi; painted camphor wood and marble, top; 'Winter Bears', 1988, by Jeff Koons, above :I^ ----------- L-L&MM& t is not often now that we have the chance to address ourselves to the et figurative tradition in sculpture through work that yet remains fully within the context of modernism. But with the strange and haunting figures of Kateura Funakoshi now on show at Annely Juda (23 Dering Street W1, until October 12) we find ourselves in the presence of things of such physical beauty, that one wonders why we should worry about their qualities as modern art at all. Their very straight-forward- ness and apparent simplicity are disarming, carved in sev- eral blocks of wood that are put together and painted with a delicate naturalism. Such are the present orthodoxies of for- mal abstraction that we forget how late the human figure con- tinued as the necessary cre- ative discipline of sculpture. It had always been so, in every age and culture, Egyptian, Greek, Christian, Chinese, whatever. Funakoshi is Japa- nese, and by happy coincidence the Kamakura temple sculp- ture of medieval Japan, intri- cately carved, painted and nat- uralistic, now constitutes a spectacular exhibition at the British Museum. To look, analyse, under- stand, and only then to carve and model was the making of the sculptor long into our own times. What lay at the centre of Matisse's preoccupations as a sculptor, or Degas', or Mail- lol's. What was the tradition, after all, to which the young Henry Moore found himself in such profound reaction and was yet inescapeably bound? Would Rodin have contented himself, in the profundity of his ambition, with the mere rearrangement of given ele- ments? To ask such questions is only to show how far we have come, that should make the appearance of an artist of the quality and character of Funa- koshi seem so odd simply for being the artist he is. Objects for the Ideal Home, the current exhibition at the Serpentine allery (ensington Gardens 2, until October 20), iakes the demonstration, if demon- stration were needed. Con- ceived, as a pendant to the Pop Art Show at the Royal Acad- :my, bent on showing the con- tinuing vitality of the Pop tra- dition, it affords an unlooked-for but revealing insight into the nature of our current academic modernism. Thus to the gurus of Gold- . smith's, it now seems that Pop Art can be everything and any- thing, embracing at once the fashionable orthodoxies of dada and constructivism, con- ceptualism and minimalism. That each is as arid and nihil- istic as any other the second, or is it the the third time, around, is soon forgotten. Simple description is never unfair, merely unkind. Julian Opie shows \"M\" of 1988, two industrial heating or air-conditioning vents placed, as they would be, high on the wall. Michael Craig-Martin offers an arrangement of samples of Venetian Blinds, in delicate pastel shades, hung in rows upon the wall, four by four. Tim Head gives us \"Fallout\", a large colour photograph of a mass of plastic toys. Bertrand Lavier's \"Hot Point\" is a refrigerator painted over in thick white acrylic paint. Mike Kelley has a party of Teddy Bears sitting round a blanket. Jenny Holzer's \"Truisms\" run endlessly across the screen: \"REMEMBER TO REACT\", in case we should forget. Only Clive Barker, with his \"Venus with tongue in cheek\" and Richard Wentworth, with his punning \"Cumulus\", a cluster of white china plates propped high on a ladder, show any wit or what might pass as formal invention, and even with them it must be said that the image of the one, the material of the other, are second-hand, received only to be modified, adjusted, elegantly redisposed. And there is Jeff Koons with his \"Winter Bears\", carved in wood and brightly painted, the ancient pairing of priest and priestess, King and Queen, reduced to the trivial, nudge-and-wink banality of Walt Disney. In's a curious way they bring us back to Katsura Funakoshi. They too are carved and painted wooden sculpture, and of a not altogether dissimilar scale, but what a difference they point. For all the effort of their making, Koons's bears offer us nothing beyond a superficial kitsch enjoyment, a self-regarding intellectual double-take, at once patronising and defensive. How clever we are to enjoy the joke of vulgarity legitimised as art, and how safe. But, as a less sophisticated Popster once' famously remarked, \"Is that it?\" The poverty of spirit behind the striking of such attitudes, or maybe the cynical absence of any critical ambition, quite takes the breath away. As for the unblinking seriousness with which such stuff is curatorially received, there is nothing to say. Or is it perhaps that a real fear is lurking there: fear of exposure to the realities of experience, fear of responsibility, personal frailty, vulnerability, fear of the imagination, fear of the truth? With these figures of Funakoshi, as with all true sculpture of the past, such humane and eternal considerations are inescapeable. The portrait is scrupulously made, the figure standing there to the life, challenge our very sense of ourselves by the most direct of comparisons. And yet they transcend all particulars personality to achieve a true monumentality. Just as with the priest in the Egyptian tomb, or the Hellenistic portrait, all quirks of individuality serve simply to point the common humanity the more. In recognising these works as portraits, we hardly care of whom they are, for it is ourselves we see in them. There is nothing any sculptor can do that is more ambitious, or difficult, or worthwhile.",

   "text_content" : "The relationship between the Royal Danish Ballet and the monarchy has ever been close, but surely never closer than on Friday night, when a staging designed by Queen Margrethe II received its first perfor- mance. The event had nothing of a \"stunt\" about it. Her Maj- esty is an accomplished painter, and the choice of bal- let was markedly apt. A Folk Tale is one of Bournonville's finest creations, and of all his surviving works, the most essentially Danish. It offers a view of Danish country life in the 16th century which com- bines idealism about that soci- ety with a love of the folk- world of magic, trolls and changelings, and as always with Bournonville, an under- pinning of moral sensibility to bring the action to a happy conclusion. To turn to Queen Margrethe as designer for this intensely traditional and greatly loved piece seems to me to realise that the Queen as artist would draw upon the special feelings of the monarch for her nation's history. There has resulted a design which is notable for its sympathy with Bournonville's own portrayal of an idyllic age. A summer landscape, a manor- house in the depths of the countryside, a trolls' cave, are shown to us in direct and unfussed pictorial terms. Cos- tuming is in bright, clear col- ours. Here is a visual language - owing much to Danish arts of the XVI century - abso- lutely attuned to Bournon- ville's spirit. Where the ballet shows its darker side - it deals with madness and greed - the chief innovation of the design is in peopling the drunken troll orgy of Act 2 with monsters inspired by folk- legend. Some figures are prop- erly menacing (Tolkein-ish tree-spirits; ogres like gigantic truffles) but the scene loses something of its unease as it turns into a circus parade of freaks and cuddly toys. A Folk Tale is the story of the lovely Hilda, stolen as a baby from a manor-house by trolls, and fated to live under- ground with Muri, the troll- mother, while Muri's child, Birthe, takes her place. Twenty years on, Birthe (a carrot- headed demon of caprice and sudden rages) is supposed to marry the young Squire Ove. But on midsummer-eve , near the trolls' hill, he sees Hilda and falls in love with her, and is then driven mad by the dan- cingelf-maidens. Hilda flees the troll's realm when ordered to marry Diderik, one of Muri's sons. Accompanied by Muri's other son, the gently adoring Viderik, Hilda sees Ove in his madness and cures him with water from a holy well. She is duly recognised as the rightful heiress of the manor, and mar- ries Ove; while Birthe is driven_ away, to be married off for gold to a vain fortune-hunter. The simplicities of the tale are only on the surface. Under- neath lie remarkable complexi- ties of feeling, notably in the role of Birthe, who is a subject to tantrums that have vivid choreographic outline, and in the contrasted troll-brothers, Viderik and Diderik. For more than a decade, A Folk Tale has languished in flimsy and not very sympathetic settings. Hence the need for this refur- bishment of design and revi- sion of the production itself. Changes in the staging are slight, and most significant in the playing of the trolls. In recent years Viderik and Diderik were given consum- mate performance by two of the Royal Danes' greatest art- ists, Fredbjorn Bjornsson and Niels Kehlet - both in their time glorious dancers, and then turning into mime artists of no less distinction. Their playing gave energy and pathos to the narrative. At the first two showings I found the roles less convincing, not least because Viderik was being taken (for the first time) by a woman. Sorella Englund, an reter no nenaixen ana iUoa wcnanaon as uve ana anaa artist of superb gifts, provided an endearing comic interpreta- tion which ultimately had little to do with A Folk Tale. The role was emasculated, and instead of the sorrows of unre- quited love, we saw Disney-ish cuteness. It was Us Jeppeson, who has been an ideal Hilda, who kept the flag of troll temperament flying as Birthe, with a portrait of hysteria and blind fury which was both funny and oddly pitiable. SilIa Schandorff was the Hilda, clear, bright in step, gentle in feeling; and Peter Bo Bendixen was Ove, making much of a role which comprises anguished glances and almost no dancing. The surrounding cast demonstrated those long-time virtues of the Danish Ballet: the happiest ease on stage; complete involvement in their charac- terisations. Kirsten Simone's performance seems to typify this: as Birthe's nurse she played with a subtlety and sympathy for events that brought grace to every scene. The production looks slightly raw as yet, but the Danes' sense of tradition will remedy this. And as an histori- cal note let me record that amid the first night cheers Queen Margrethe 11 took calls with the company, bowing to her delighted public in proper theatrical fashion. It was a unique and happy sight Clement Crisp",

   "text_content" : "Opera Northern Ireland's canny twin-track of innovation and acquisition has kept their biannual productions lively and provocative. The autumn seaso'f - a week of perfor- mances at the Belfast Grand Opera House - pairs a Bar- tered Bride based upon Welsh National Opera's staging and a brand-new Cosn fan tutte from an all-Dutch production team, and manages to keep the same mix. Neither is completely suc- cessful, on the level for instance of ONI's Figaro last spring, but both are entertain- ing, rewarding shows. What remains of The Bar- tered Bride from its earlier Car- diff incarnation is basically Jan Schlubach's sets and Elisa- beth Urbancic's costumes; Mike Ashman has replaced Rudolph Nolte's original pro- duction with his own. In what is a cheerful all-purpose design which could convincingly house about a third of the entire operatic repertory, Ash- man's hands have still been tied to period and production style; he gives a robust tradi- tional perspective that stutters just a little early on, always finds plenty of recreation for the enthusiastic chorus and really starts to liven up in the third act with a splendidly tacky circus troupe. The dialogue is problematic; Ashman resists. a mid-Atlantic homogenisation, so a broad Welsh Kecal confronts a vaguely Scottish Jenik, while the Marenka very obviously hails from well south of the Mason-Dixon line. It gives a jolt to the credibility of the action every time, and the strangely potent emotional mix of the music has to reassert afresh for every number. The performances too sometimes strain belief; only Philip Joll's Kecal, gaining in effectiveness throughout the evening with ever broader gestures, really passes muster. Nova Thomas was in uncertain voice as Mar- enka, Gordon Wilson seemed underpowered as Jenik; Chris- topher Gillett was a charming Vasek in an Albert-Herringish sort of way. Howard Williams conducted, blazing off with the Ulster Orchestra in a hyper- dramatic overture that really set the pulse racing, but failing to scale down the sound when the singers came in. Too much was obscured, too many details of the wonderful melange of styles misjudged. There were, though, no musical problems whatsoever in the Cosr, and no suggestions of period realism either. Direc- tor Javier L6pez Pilon and designers Rieks Swarte (set) and Carly Everaert (costumes) arrive from the Dutch fringe- theatre world with a staging Cynthia Buchan that seems to take fairly detailed knowledge of the emo- tional workings of the opera as a pre-requisite. As the overture is played, a roll-call of Enlightenment thinkers from Lavoisier to Leeuwenhoek, Goethe to Mes- mer, descends from the flies; afterwards, though, the philo- sophical currents do not run very deep until the final sextet when the backcloth sports a pyramid with the word ratio, \"logic\" emblazoned across it. If this a world in which rationality rules, then it is one full of strange inconsistencies; costumes (when they are not straight out of pantomime) are a gleeful post-modem mixture of styles - slinky ddcolletde for the sisters, huntin' and fishin' Jackets for their lovers and Alfonso, and a constant parade of cardboard cut-out After Alfonso hatches his scheme the three men turn their shotguns on a row of fair- ground ducks; \"Soave il vento\" is sung to a parade of paper boats threaded across the stage; the Albanians arrive with a retinue that includes an elephant; as Fiordiligi's pas- sions begin to churn and turn a volcano smokes ominously in the background. It makes not a lot of sense, and early thoughts that there was some artful toying with perceptions of reality and antasy going on complex turn out not to bear close scrutiny. The last scene is thoroughly confusing, and unless one knows in advance just who is feeling what, and also what the music is doing simultaneously, it offers no explanations at all. The singing offers plentiful compensations. Both the Fiordiligi of Sylvie Valayre and the Dorabella of Cynthia Buchan are sparky, not at all grand; Miss Buchan's tone is something of an acquired taste but she delivers with such vivacity and wit that reservations are set aside, while Miss Valayre smoulders and burns with such intensity and sings with such clean attack and good sense that they compldment each other perfectly. Linda Ormiston contributes a well-ripened Despina, full of flamboyance and cynicism, the antithesis of Houb Claessen's consistently understated Alfonso, beautifully paced, wryly sardonic and always in control. Johannes Mannov's Guglielmo is as polished and elegant as his Alamviva for ONI earlier in the year; Philip Sheffield's Ferrando looks handsome and keeps intelligently within his vocal powers. Kenneth Montgomery's conducting is similarly unfussy, and his continuo playing a model of tact; it all makes a solid base on which to erect a production of some fascination but ultimately, one suspects, rather uncertain effect.

   "text_content" : "QRIHEWICH THE ATIH Almost the best scene in this production of Ben Travers' old farce comes at the end and is not in the text. It consists of the entire cast singing and dancing \"That's My Baby\" with a zest and enthusiasm that do not yet permeate the show as a whole. Only when one sees all ten of them together does it fully register what an array of char- acters and costumes there has been. Rookery Nook has always been referred to as a farce ever since it was first performed in the 1920s. Yet the description is a shade misleading. Certainly it has farce in it, but the play is more of a jolly English romp with elements of drawing room comedy thrown in. To be sure, there are bed- room doors leading off-stage and scenes of slight (very slight) undress, but anything to do with sex is a long way off. The fastest scene is made up simply of a bunch of men scrummaging for a parcel of clothes as if it were a rugby ball. I doubt if the French would recognise it as farce at all. So it is a very English piece with a touch of P G Wode- house, though at a lower social level. As such it remains endearing, though I had forgot- ten how slowly it starts. In a S I 11 MM 11r i programme note, Matthew Francis, the artistic director at Greenwich, almost apologises .for putting it on. The aim, he admits, is to raise money for the theatre. The trouble with this approach, however, is that it depends on the play being very well done. Under Francis's direction, there are no individual faults. Richard Garnett's Clive, the taller of the two cousins pursu- ing the same girl, is all that one could expect of a hand- some 1920s man. Jim Dunk as Putz, the step- father of the girl, is a thor- oughly ferocious stock stage German and there is a splendid caricature of a caricature of a stock stage daily from Linda Broughton. She has a remark- able walk, especially when going upstairs. One could go through the rest of the cast with much the same kind of praise. The cos- tumes designed by Anne Gruenberg are a delight and there is nothing wrong with Di Seymour's country-house set. Yet somehow the playing does not quite hang together. Perhaps it needs a little more pace, or perhaps after all this time we are finally grow- ing tired of Travers. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "GERMAN ECONOMIC policy is a case of an irresistible force - the fiscal costs of unification - meeting an immovable object - the Bundesbank's determi- nation to return to price stabil- ity. The current joke is that German fiscal policy would not meet Germany's criteria for participation in European eco- nomic and monetary union. This is not a situation with which Mr Helmut Schlesinger's Bundesbank feels comfortable; it will not allow the politicians to feel comfortable with it either. Yet the Bundesbank may be even more worried about how the German public sector defi- cit might be reduced than about the deficit itself. So at least one can conclude from its latest monthly report, which argues that \"restraint in public spending should have priority over tax increases that would be problematic from a growth or stability standpoint\". The immediate economic consequences of German union were a collapse of supply in the east and a large boost to demand in the west. The link between the two has been sis- cal policy. As the eastern econ- omy has collapsed, the costs of sustaining it have soared. The result was a budgetary transfer that could be 6 per cent of west German gross national product in 1991, on official estimates. This fiscal deficit has been financed almost entirely by borrowing. The Bundesbank now estimates that the total public sector deficit (including social security payments) might be at the bottom end of the expected range of between DM140bn and DM160bn this year, partly because it has proved impossible to spend as much in the east as intended. Even so, that deficit would be about 5 per cent of German GNP. Fiscal boost Added to the spending by east Germans of some of the D-Marks they received last summer, this fiscal boost has brought high growth to the west German economy: 4.5 per cent in 1990 and perhaps 3 per cent in 1991. But a fiscal boost, like all good things, comes to an end. Growth has slowed sharply in the course of 1991 and is expected by economists at the major German commer- cial banks to be 1%-2 per cent between 1991 and 1992. One reason for the slowdown is that Keynesian fiscal expan- sions have only once and for all effects; the other is mone- tary policy. The Bundesbank usually tries to avoid overkill, but it has imposed quite a severe monetary squeeze, with the short-term rate of interest almost a percentage point above the long-term rate. The Bundesbank is determined to stop current pay inflation, which has risen from below 3 per cent in 1989 to over 7 per cent in the year to August 1991, from turning into a true wage-price spiral. It is equally determined to return consumer price inflation to its long-term target of 2 per cent, from its recent level of over 4 per cent. Bundesbank warning This is where the Bundes- bank's warning about how the fiscal deficit is to be closed comes in. What the Bundes- bank objects to most are increases in indirect taxes, such as the recently introduced increases in petrol and other consumer taxes, which have already raised the price level by close to 1 per cent. It is similarly concerned about the proposed increase in the rate of value added tax, which is intended for 1993. Such tax increases, it fears, will seri- ously aggravate the wage-price spiral. The Bundesbank is not pre- pared to accommodate such government-induced price increases. It may be overstat- ing the dangers. But the results of its concern are clear. There will be a sharper slow- down than necessary, even though the Bundesbank agrees that a reduction in the budget deficit is itself desirable. A feature of German unifica- tion this far has been the unwillingness of the west Ger- mans to pay for it. A feature of unification in future may be the refusal of the Bundesbank to accommodate the inflation- ary consequences of how the government tries to pay for it. If spending cuts in west Ger- many are politically infeasible, the conflict between the Bund- esbank and the government is unavoidable. Considerable eco- nomic discomfort then lies ahead, both for Germany and for the rest of Europe.",

   "text_content" : "SO JUDGES, generals and permanent secretaries have joined the governor of the Bank of England and the Arch- bishop of Canterbury as vic- tims of the undeclared election war. The next report of the Top Salaries Review Body has been deferred so that pay awards to take some of these bigwigs over Â£100,000 a year do not become a pre-election issue. Sympathy for top people might be thin on the ground, particularly since it is the TSRB itself which is behind the move. Yet the responsibil- ity undoubtedly lies in the hands of politicians of all stripes, who find interfering with top public servants' pay irresistible. The government almost invariably cuts back or stages the TSRB awards either to court political popularity or pour encourager les autres. The opposition which spends much of its time decrying the low pay of employees in public sec- tor bodies launches into dia- tribes against pay rises for the people who head them. Earlier this year, the TSRB itself blew the whistle on this unedifying spectacle. Its 1991 report noted that the salaries of public servants covered by its remit were generally less than half the median earnings of comparable employees in the private sector. And it announced a \"wide-ranging and fundamental review\" of the pay levels of TSRB groups, using management consultants to compare senior jobs in the public services with those in industry and abroad. IneqPitable The body was clearly angered at the staging of the increases it had recommended in 1990 and earlier years - such delays, it said, were \"inequitable\". Since top jobs were usually held by people approaching retirement age, the loss of income could con- tinue for the rest of the indi- vidual's life where his or her pension was related to final pay. As if to emphasise the need for such a review, the government then decided to stage the 9.5 per cent increse reTminmeled for 1991, to keep the cost to 83 per cent. It is a pity tdit politicians cann fid it in themselves to defend reasonable pay for those who fill top posts in the public services. No-one joins the civil service to get rich, but those who do are required to conform to standards of integ- rity and honesty which are refreshing when compared with many other democracies. It would be sad if the UK were to find itself in a similar posi- tion to the US, where few can afford to stay long in high pub- lic office, and most pass swiftly through the revolving door to more lucrative employment in the private sector leaving gov- ernment as a low-pay ghetto. Public confidence The mechanism of indepen- dent pay review bodies is designed precisely to avoid such problems for employees who work in those parts of the public service lacking the disci- pline of profitability. Determin- ing their pay by comparison with similar types of work in the private sector is the fairest and most efficient approach. Public confidence in such com- parability requires that research and decision-making be controlled by an indepen- dent body - and that confi- dence can only be shaken when politicians second-guess the process. It is, of course, open to min- isters to set the terms for pay review bodies, and these can be tightly drawn, as with the new school teachers' review body. Most of the existing bod- ies have been required in recent years to consider staff turnover in addition to compa- rability - this helps control costs when labour markets are slack, while allowing addi- tional resources to be targeted when recruitment and reten- tion become problems. And the TSRB has signalled its desire to look again at the \"discount\" which is applied to public ser- vice pay to reflect the greater job security which most top civil servants continue to The review body process cm, therefoe, be refined and developed, but the conpuabu- ity element cannot be cked. Against the background of recent events, the desire of the TSRB to take its current review out of the political bat- tle is understandable. But it reflects Ibdly a the politicians who canot be trusted not to rfrt-nO -------~",

   "text_content" : "H as Mr Norman Lament, one of the cabinet's most prom- inent Euro-sceptics, sold the pass on Economic and Monetary Union? The honeyed words that emerged over the weekend from an informal meeting of European Community eco- nomics and finance ministers in the Dutih spa town of Apeldoorn have raised suspicions that the UK govern- ment may, after all, be softening its hardline stance towards plans for a single European currency and central bank. In particular, the fact that the chan- cellor put forward a five-point plan for advancing from the proposed transi- tional second stage of Emu to the final third stage has raised hopes among other EC member states that Britain may be among the first wave of countries to join the eventual union. The truth, as is often the case in matters European, is more prosaic. While the UK government is playing an active part in the Emu negotia- tions, the proposals it put forward at the weekend were procedural in nature and are not intended to preju- dice the right of the House of Com- mons to accept or reject Emu mem- bership. Although Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the weekend meeting, declared that the ministers had \"made a decisive step forward\", there is still much nitty gritty to be negotiated among the Twelve before an Emu treaty can be signed at December's summit meeting of EC leaders in Maastricht. Mr Lamont has had a difficult hand to play in the inter-governmental con- ference on Emu in the past few months. He has never pretended to be enthusiastic about Europe. The gov- ernment he represents has never endorsed for the UK a single currency and central bank: the two goals that are at the heart of plans for Emu. Moreover, Europe is an issue that could shatter the unity of the Conser- vative party. For much of the time, Britain's stance has been essentially reactive to the negotiations among its 11 part- ners. Yet, because Britain cannot afford to be left out of the creation of Emu, the chancellor has had to make as constructive a contribution as pos- sible in the complex international negotiations leading to the Maastricht summit. At times, Mr Lamont and his officials have been able to duck out of the limelight as other nations have quarrelled. This option was not avail- able in Apeldoorn, where the discus- sions were harmonious. As a result, Britain's willing partici- pation in the Emu discussions came sharply into focus in the UK media over the weekend. At the same time, the progress being made by Britain in reducing its annual inflation rate towards the levels of Germany and the other low-inflation countries in the European Monetary System is making an eventual membership of Emu look more than just a theoretical possibility. It was against this background that Mr Lamont took and developed ideas put forward by the Dutch and the Belgians for defining how the third final stage in Emu should come about. The five steps, which are summar- ised in the accompanying illustration, have to be seen in the context of recent Dutch proposals that make membership of the third and final stage of Emu contingent on the indi- vidual EC member states satisfying various economic conditions that have become known as the conver- gence criteria. These are low infla- tion, a sustainable budget position, two years' membership of the narrow bands of the EMS exchange rate mechanism and interest rates close to those of the low-inflation EC coun- tries. The UK's five steps were couched positively but at bottom are designed to ensure that the UK's final say on Emu remains with the House of Com- mons. UK's steps for moving n stage 2 to stage 3 of emie and Monetary Union e European Commission and the Monetary Institute report on progress n stage 2 of Emu. oflin rules on which of the EC's 12 ates meet the criteria for economic ce necessary for membership of stage 3. ; leaders look at the Commission, EMI 4 reports and reach consensus on a date to stage 3. 0 )untries identified as suitable s for full Emu may nominate themselves 0o I 00 a previously agreed quorum of nominate themselves as Emu members, gree the necessary detailed measures i stage 3 with its single currency and nk. The first three steps, defining how the Community would determine which countries are ready for Emu and when they should take that step, are relatively uncontroversial. Step four, where countries which have been identified as suitable candi- dates for full Emu may nominate themselves for stage three, is seen by the UK Treasury as important for Britain. Because the EC members would put themselves forward for Emu, the House of Commons would at this point have a vote on the issue. At step five, the question of critical mass would arise. The original Dutch draft suggested that it would be possi- ble to advance to Emu with just six members. The UK has suggested that eight would be a suitable minimum number while Belgium, acting out its traditional role as a framer of compro- mises in Community disputes, has suggested seven. If Mr Lamont's five steps were to be adopted by the Community, they would give the UK parliament two chances to vote on Emu. The first would come at the end of the debate on the Emu treaty that is due to be agreed at Maastricht. The second chance would come at step four of the procedure for moving from stage two to stage three. Using the timetables that have been under discussion, this would be in 1997 at the earliest and therefore most probably in the life, not of the next parliament, but the one after next. It is this long-term aspect to the Emu project that explains why the UK government has been so anxious to help shape the negotiations. British Treasury officials yesterday were insisting that a constructive UK approach to the procedure of Emu did not amount to acceptance of Emu. Instead, it was designed to give parlia- ment the final say in an unfettered manner. Certainly, there was one person sit- ting at the same table as Mr Lamont in Apeldoorn who saw a threat to the Emu project in the UK proposals. The prospect of parliaments in each mem- Treasury officials insist that a constructive UK approach to the Emu procedure does not mean acceptance. Rather, it is designed to give parliament the final say in an unfettered manner ber state having two bites of the Emu cherry before deciding on union was opposed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. While pre- pared to make an exception in the case of Britain, he wants other nations to be bound to eventual Emu membership by their agreement to the treaty. For this reason, Mr Delors pushed hard for an accord in which all 12 EC member states should be assumed to be in Emu, with specific \"deroga- tions\" or let-out provisions for those weaker economies unable to make it on time. Mr Lamont was clearly uncomfort- able about this aspect of the Apel- doom discussion, which put the onus on countries to opt out, rather than i into, Emu. \"The very use of the word derogation implies that staying out (of Emu) is only temporary.\" The UK chancellor noted that Mr Delors had \"given the game away\" by suggesting that a better word for derogation was i \"transition\". It is possible that Mr Lamont will have to experience similar discomfort i in the few remaining weeks before i Maastricht. Although the chancellor always vigorously denies that Britain 1 wants to see the Emu negotiations i founder, his position was never stron- ger than in September when the 1 Dutch, backed by Germany and the UK, were advocating tough economic 1 conditions for Emu against the wishes i of the southern EC members, led by 1 Italy. In Apeldoorn, ministers put Emu back on a more even keel. At what i one participant termed \"a cotton-wool i meeting\", they generally agreed that all 12 states should have a say in all moves towards Emu, and that no institutional - as distinct from eco- I nomic - barriers should be erected to 1 lagging economies joining the mooted i currency union late. The debate about \"two-speed\" Emu I has hardly gone away for ever, as the i Portuguese finance minister claimed. i But the rough edges have rubbed off I it. All the weaker economies accepted I that they have no alternative but to i buckle down to try to meet the rela- tively strict convergence criteria now being drafted in the EC's Monetary Committee. In return, they were rewarded by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, making his first emollient statement in an Emu discussion for a long time. When it comes to deciding (most probably in 1997) which EC members are fit to enter Emu and which must stay outside, \"there must\", said Mr Waigel, \"be scope for political judgment\", not just one based on dry economic arith- metic. Second, ministers settled the vexed question of what monetary institution to have in the transitional second phase of Emu, which is billed to last from 1994 to 1997. Rather than the European Central Bank which some, notably Italy and the Commission, wanted to establish in embryo in stage two, there will be a European Monetary Institute, a body designed to do no more than co-ordinate mone- tary policy decisions which will still be taken in national capitals. To avoid the impression that the EMI is designed as a semi-permanent home for \"second-division\" countries out- side Emu, the institute will disappear the moment the bank is born in stage three. Apeldoorn also saw a surprisingly close meeting of French and German minds on the need to dovetail eco- nomic policy decisions - which will remain in national hands - in the currency union. There are however many other issues that will have to be resolved before the Emu treaty can be submitted to parliaments for ratifica- tion. These, which can be expected to command most attention among Britain's partners in the run-up to Maastricht, include: * the precise terms of the conver- gence criteria for moving to stage three; * the precise role of the EMI * the hardening of the Ecu, or Euro- pean currency unit; * large areas of the final blueprint for stage three, which are still blank, and; * how the treaty can reflect the right balance between leaving economic policy decisions in national hands, and ensuring that no one country drags Emu down by running exces- sive budget deficits. But Britain could face a special problem as the Maastricht summit approaches. The signs are that its partners now assume that it has no political difficulties, or at least none with the Emu section of the planned treaty. Mr Kok, whose draft Emu treaty, due to be presented on October 23, will form the final textual battle- ground, said he thought Britain's problem was now solved by the three agreed guidelines for Emu decision- making. These are that no country would be coerced into entering Emu, nor allowed to veto others doing so, nor shut out arbitrarily. Mr Delors said that the first of these principles should be quite enough to satisfy the UK government. But clearly Mr Lamont still thinks he has a problem. \"It is our position - and if necessary it will be our posi- tion at Maastricht - that we cannot accept a commitment or the presump- tion of a commitment\" to a single currency, he said. Further UK demands for treaty changes - such as perhaps looser ref- erences to the one-money goal of Emu - seem now likely to run into a brick wall of opposition. In the event of the Emu negotia- tions proving unsatisfactory for the UK government, the UK could either demand a footnote reserving its posi- tion, or veto the whole treaty. The first course would please no one. The second course would be seen by many as apocalyptic, but UK officials in London yesterday were careful not to rule out such a step should the Maastricht summit not go Britain's way.",

   "text_content" : "* Sir Graham Day's appointment as chairman of the new teachers' pay review body has received a predictable raspberry from the British teaching establishment. Described as a \"desiccated calculating machine\" by a trade union leader at British Shipbuilders, where he once worked, Day is nevertheless not averse to sizeable pay awards. Shortly after becoming chairman of newly privatised UK electricity-generator PowerGen, he stoutly defended an increase from Â£75,960 to Â£200,000 for the chief executive, Ed Wallis. Teachers will take note. Tall, athletic, bearded Day graduated as a lawyer. But he continued to earn money for a while from his first love, show business - partly as a singer, mainly as a producer. No sympathy then for teachers who complain about having to take spare-time work to supplement their income. After attracting Mrs Thatcher's attention during his three-year stewardship at British Shipbuilders, Day became her choice to head what was then British Leyland, in 1986. In his first two years at the re-styled Rover Group, he acquired a reputation for unseating senior managers. One was Jean Denton, director of external affairs; she found herself surplus to requirements and went off to become deputy chairman of the Black Country Development Corporation. The two have no doubt kissed and made up, for Baroness Denton (as she now is) will also serve on the School Teachers' Review Body. Equally intriguing is how Sir Graham w tl fld time for yet another appointment in an already busy schedule. He is dhairman of three major C-abr o-Sdvchlppes Rover argoup and PowerGaL His BiectoWMIHpi InCHad n Ldrf Group, DAS, British Aerospace, Thorn-EMI and MAI. He is visiting professor and governor at Kingston Business School, fellow of University College Cardiff, member of the City University Business School council and governor of Birkenhead School. A member of the National Health Service Policy Board, he has just become president of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. Teachers' representatives will need to consider carefully their bargaining tactics; his motto is said to be \"I never lie and I never bluff\".",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "From Mr Peter Rost MP. Sir, Genuine competition in gas supply can only become a reality when the ring-fence round the UK continental shelf is breached by connections to the European grid with free- dom to import - and export. Power generators should be free to shop around for gas, otherwise Britain will not achieve a competitive market in electricity as government desires and consumers need. British Gas is only too well aware that it will never get the politicians, regulator and Monopolies and Mergers Com- mission off its back until at least 30 per cent of the gas is supplied by independents. The same problem will face the duopoly in electricity produc- tion unless adequate competi- tion develops from indepen- dent generators. But competition in gas depends not only on diverse sources of supply. What is urgently required is amend- ment of the Gas Act. The 25,000 therm divide between tariff and contract gas, unreasonably inhibits competition. The tariff market was designed to protect domestic consumers who can only depend upon a monoply supplier. But within it are trapped more than 500,000 industrial and commercial cus- tomers who need and are enti- tled to have the freedom to shop around. Many are doubly handicapped because they have multiple sites, each charged a tariff little less than the domestic rate, although using, in total, amounts that, if they were allowed to aggregate their purchase, would bring them within lower-cost bands. Why should not such big customers, representing large organisations, have the free- dom to negotiate contracts, as they can for every other ser- vice they purchase? The cut-off point for the regulated tariff markets should be reduced to 5,000 therms. That would still protect even the largest domes- tic consumer, but free up industrial and commercial cus- tomers. Nor will there be a competi- tive gas market until the distri- bution network is separated from British Gas, as the elec- tricity grid has been from pro- ducers. The gas grid needs to operate as an independent business, with open access to all at fair commercial rates.

   "text_content" : "As a general election approaches, James Buxton looks at the political options facing Scotland I any party but the Conser- vative wins the approach- ing British general elec- tion, Scotland is set to face its most sweeping political 'changes since the Scottish par- liament disappeared in 1707. If Labour wins it has promised to create a new Scottish parlia- ment in its first Westminster session, based on a blueprint it has drawn up over the past two and half years with the Liberal Democrats. In the less likely event of the Scottish National party win- ning a majority in Scotland, the Scots would be deemed to have voted to leave the United Kingdom altogether and to become a separate member of the EC. Even if the Conservatives win overall but only manage to retain the nine seats they now have in Scotland, many observ- ers believe they would have to go back on all they have said in the past 10 years and give Scotland an assembly (which would probably be their name for a parliament). Many of their own supporters in Scot- land are urging just that. As delegates at next week's Labour party conference in Brighton will understand, the effect of these changes would not be confined to Scotland. For one thing it is likely (though not certain) that the Scottish parliament would be elected by proportional repre- sentation, setting a precedent in Britain for abandoning the first-past-the-post system. In due course, Labour says, it would set up local parlia- ments in other parts of Britain, starting with Wales but spread- ing to the English regions. Yet the loser from this con- stitutional upheaval could be the author of it. Though Labour prefers to duck this issue, the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster, or their voting powers, might have to be reduced. Scotland is not only already over-represented in the House of Commons but it would end up having its own parliament as well. The loss of the MPs would be bad news for Labour: it has 48 of the 72 Scot- tish MPs and they now account for more than a fifth of its Westminster representation. The real worry for Labour at the moment is the SNP. Two of the 50 Scottish seats Labour won in 1987 have been added to the three which the SNP took: one through the by-election victory of Mr Jim Sillars at Glasgow Govan, the other through Mr Dick Douglas, MP for Dunfermline West, aban- doning Labour for the SNP. Considering the scale of the changes that could be in store, Scotland's political tempera- ture has been remarkably cool since the resignation of Mrs B, ::â ^ ^u ^j~~frifj~~~ii 11*i *rm i -^ \"' Thatcher last year. The ques- tions of devolution (a parlia- ment within the UK) and inde- pendence (separate nationhood) are rarely talked about by ordinary voters. The Scottish constitutional convention, the gathering of mainly Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians which drew up a scheme for a Scot- tish parliament, was launched with dignified ceremony in early 1989. But by the end of last year it had almost fizzled out: it produced its blueprint but abandoned its aim of popu- larising the idea of a Scottish parliament, instead leaving it to its constituent parties. Yet this picture of indiffer- ence conceals disquiet over Scotland's current political arrangements. Opinion polls show that only. about 20 per cent of Scots are content with the constitutional status quo; about 45 per cent want a devolved Scottish assembly and about 35 per cent outright independence. That cannot be explained away by pointing out that for most people constitu- tional change is near the bot- tom of their priorities. The Scots' dislike of Mrs Thatcher fortified their sense of a separate identity. After 1979, the Tories have been gov- erning Scotland with a dwind- ling band of supporters: in 1987 they won only 10 Scottish seats. Political commentators such as the writer Mr Alan Massie believe that the Scots' sense of Britishness has been in decline since the ending of the British empire deprived the union of much of its raison d'etre. Young Scots increasingly would not find it unthinkable to exchange their British nationality for a European one. It is on these foundations About 45 per cent of Scots want a devolved assembly; 35 per cent outright independence that Labour proposes creating a parliament in Edinburgh. According to the constitutional convention's blueprint, which the party calls a \"sound basis\" on which to proceed, the par- liament would be responsible for virtually everything in Scotland except for overall eco- nomic management, defence and foreign affairs. It would receive all income tax and VAT raised in Scot- land, be able to levy a small supplementary income tax (though the Labour leader Neil Kinnock said in Edinburgh recently that it would be most unwise to do so because it would be unpopular), and would still receive supplemen- tary grants from Westminster. From the SNP viewpoint the prospectus is \"fraudulent\". Mr Jim Sillars, deputy leader of the SNP, says it would not give Scotland the degree of indepen- dence from Westminster that the convention claims. The Tories think the prospectus goes too far. Lord Mackay of Clashfearn, the Scottish-born Lord Chancellor, told Conser- vatives last week that a Scot- tish parliament \"would encour- age the forces of disintegration and separatism\". Critics on all sides point out that the convention has not addressed the crucial question of why Scottish MPs should be allowed to continue to vote for example, on education in East Anglia while East Anglian MPs would have no say on educa- tion in Scotland. This question was originally posed in the 1970s devolution debate by Mr Tam Dalyell, then MP for West Lothian, and is known as \"the West Lothian question\". Recently Mr Dalyell (now MP for Linlithgow) broke his silence on the subject and said that Labour was \"dream- ing\" if thought English MPs would accept such an unequal diviion of power with the S0cs. iCan you imagirne that If Labour wings the next lecon, Joh Smith is chancellor, Gor- don Brownis secretary of state for trade and Robin Cook [all Scots] is running the health service, all with a major say in how is governed, that no l MpP w bat an eye- lid?\" Labour's answer that equal- ity would be restored by the creation of a Welsh assembly (though with less power than the Scottish parliament) and the gradual establishment of assemblies in the English regions does not carry much conviction, partly because, out- side Wales, there is little popu- lar demand forthem. In practice it is unlikely that the House of Commons would approve anything as elaborate as the convention blueprint, involving handing over to Scot- land large sums of revenue without having control of how it was spent. But even a more modest Scottish assembly would turn the spotlight on the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster. Last week the Hansard Society, a non-party study group, pro- posed cutting the number of Scottish MPs by 13 and the Welsh by five, and redistribut- ing them among the English. This is where devolution begins to look attractive for the Conservatives. Mr John Major tells the Scots that devo- lution is not in their interests but ministers increasingly underline that their objection is to a \"tax-raising\" assembly, as if preparing a retreat to a non-tax-raising body. On the Tories' present opin- ion poll showing of 25 per cent in Scotland they are not likely to do much better than they did in 1987 (see accompanying graph). But if they win the next election with an even smaller number of Scottish seats, they are likely to face increasing clamour for a Scot- tish assembly. If they cut the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster at the same time as setting up an assembly, Labour's chances of winning a UK majority at a subsequent election would be slimmer. The SNP regards devolution as a messy halfway house which solves nothing. It hopes to create a surge in popular support for Scottish indepen- dence following the example of the Baltic states. But on its current ICM opinion poll stand- ing of 19 per cent of the vote, it has no guarantee of winning more seats against Labour, whose support stands at 43 per cent. In fact, if Scotland votes along these lines, the result could be rather like that of 1987. But the consequences might well be different.",

Now, however, the time for a dhange has come. For the CCITr has now standardised SDH, Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, thus creating the firt worlwMide standard in transmission technology. What will SDH be able to give us? What will now become possible on an international level with Synchrunous Digital Hierarchy? Benefit 1: worldwide transmission of plesio- chronous and synchronous source signals through one single network. Benefit 2: simultaneous transmission of bit rates on different hierarchy levels.

   "text_content" : "The real rev- olution in Europe is not political. It is demographic. Never mind about the integration of the former communist nations of the east. That will look after itself. Grieve for Yugoslavia, but do not imagine that you can do anything about it. Cast aside fears of domination by the bureaucrats of Brussels. Most of them are mere hus- bands in suits, a slowly vanishing species. On present form Europe's preoccupations of the near future are likely to be centred on the sudden emergence of a huge cohort of ignorant old women, not to mention the persistent knock- ing at our window-panes of economic refugees from the Third World. I say this because the Coun- cil of Europe has produced an account* of the proceedings of its most recent seminar on demographic trends and life- styles. All 438 typed A4 pages have just landed on my desk. The story they tell is gripping. The response of governments is still awaited. First, if you exclude the Turks from the calculations, Europe's indigenous popula- tion seems to be moving from a period of low-to-zero growth to one of shrinkage. The Council of Europe embraces the 12 members of the Euro- pean Community, plus Aus- tria, Cyprus, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Since 1950 this area's population has increased by some 100m to just over 400m, at an average growth rate of 0.89 per cent per year. That compares with a world growth rate of 2.6 per cent per year. Say those numbers to yourself slowly, then sit down and have a cup of tea. You may need it. On the broader UN defini- tion of Europe, which moves the border further, east, the growth rate is down to 0.73 per cent a year. But Turkey's population has more than doubled since 1950, at an annual rate of expansion of 4.67 per cent. Exclude it, and Europe's procreative perfor- mance is even less impressive. In short, Europe minus Tur- key is moving from zero popu- lation growth to a period of insufficient fertility to replace its existing population. Broadly speaking, the north- ern countries are leading the way down this counter-Mal- thusian slope; the Mediterra- neans, including France, are catching up. One consequence of this process is that Europe is age- ing. In the United Kingdom the proportion of the popula- tion aged 65 and over was 9.2 per cent in 1950. Today it is about 12.5 per cent. By 2025 it will be 15.8 per cent. Tables showing numbers of over 75s indicate much the same sort of progression. These figures are paralleled in other Euro- pean countries, with the Scan- dinavians, Dutch and Swiss getting older faster than most of the rest of us. The big exception is again Turkey, whose over-65s will, at 7.9 per cent, constitute a lower pro- portion of their population in 2025 than did ours in 1950. Since women live longer Demographers have at least as much to say as economists, if only we will hear them than men most of these old folk will be females. Past baby booms, creating generational waves, distort the figures and give some prospect of a com- parative \"rejuvenation\" between 2000 and 2020, when the young-old (people aged 65 to 75) will be relatively more preponderant. But as the years move on women of over 75 will come to constitute just under half of the European population of over-65s. These are not idle forecasts: all of the people to whom I refer are living today. Only a sudden upswing in the birth rate could reduce the percentage share of the aged in the next few decades; only an improve- ment in male longevity could change the mix. Some of the policy implica- tions of these findings are already well-known, although not widely practised. Adult education and training, pref- erably stretching over the life- time of an individual, would enable the young-old to be self-financing and not depen- dent on insufficiently funded JL pension provisions or ever increasing taxpayers' subven- tions. Since women now alive tend to have been less inten- sively educated than men, special courses for older females may be desirable. Our growing army of old ladies is not readily employable: the Russian method, putting them out to sweep the streets, would not be popular in the west. Care for the infirm old-old is another matter. When peo- ple lived less long and stayed married the family took care of its grandparents. Now, as the Council of Europe report shows, Scandinavian notions of cohabitation and single-par- enthood are breaking up tra- ditional stable marriage patterns across the Continent. Individualism is the norm. Care in the community is all very well where there is a sense of community. But when thht fades, all that is left is plain suffering, or the purchase of care by or for the elderly themselves. I am at a loss when it comes to those millions of brown noses pressed against the win- dow-panes of our rich white world. The correct response of the liberal economist is to open all borders, allowing the labour market to regulate the flow of migrants. Personally, I would have no quarrel with that. It would enrich all our lives. European voters are, however, likely to oblige their politicians to erect ever- higher barriers - even against the Turks, let alone north Africans and others. This is already evident in Ger- man, French and Italian polit- ical discourse; Britain shut the doors years ago. A Europe that aspires to be outward- looking and humane is thus in danger of being edged by demographic pressures it can barely understand into a nar- rower, nastier mood. Most contemporary political discourse is about adding to the well-being of people aged 15 to 65, particularly during their middle years when their earnings tend to be high and rising. The politics of an older Europe, with a shrinking home-based population, have yet to be grasped. On this, demographers have at least as much to say as economists, if only we will hear them. *Available from Her Mqjesty's Stationery Office. Â£15.20"

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent THE prime minister yesterday agreed to delay completion of a pay review for senior judges, top civil servants and high-level armed forces officers to avoid political controversy in the run-up to a general elec- 1 tion. But Mr John Major's deci- 1 sion provoked protest from i Labour MPs in the light of speculation that this year's wider than usual \"fundamental review\" will call for embarrass- i ingly large increases after com- parisons with private sector i top pay rates are completed. The findings of the Top Sala- ] ries' Review Body are usually i announced in the autumn and i implemented in April. Downing Street said last night that agreement to post- 1 pone publication until after an I election came only after Mr Jump in salaries............Page 14 Editorial Comment.........Page 22 Winds of change ............Page 23 Major had received a letter requesting the delay from Sir David Nickson, the TSRB's chairman. Avoiding the. \"sensitive period\" before an election would best serve the public interest, Sir David wrote. He said an additional incentive to delay came from the \"unusu- ally volatile state\" of private pay awards with reductions in performance-related bonuses and, in some cases, pay cuts. This made the final outcome \"very difficulty to predict\" and bolstered arguments for com- pleting studies in April next year and backdating the review's findings. The announcement coin- cided with Labour's publica- tion of a leaked letter from Mr David Mellor, the Treasury chief secretary, urging the Department of Employment to cut spending on its proposed programmes for training and the unemployed. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, warned that, if re-elected, Mr Major would \"nod through\" the TSRB's find- ings just as he had approved the pay increases to chairmen of privatised industries. \"He constantly calls for moderation by the lowest paid,\" Mr Hat- tersley said. \"He should have the courage to impose the same rule on the government's top salary earners.\" In fact, according to long- standing convention, the recommendations of the TSRB, set up in 1971 to end rows over pay rates, are always agreed by the government of the day. The body's findings, based on a range of criteria including private sector salary scales, apply to 2,000 individuals made up of 1,200 senior judges, 600 top rank civil servants and 200 top military personnel Last year, it recommended a 9.5 per cent increase across all groups, taking salaries to Â£84,250, with the exception of the Lord Chief Justice, the head of the Civil Service and the Chief of the Defence Staff, who received Â£104,000. * An opinion poll conducted by NMR for the Daily Express in the 51 most marginal con- stituencies gives Labour 41 per cent, the Tories 39 per cent and Liberal Democrats 15 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb and Laura Silber in Belgrade LIFE in the Croatian capital of Zagreb returned cautiously to normal yesterday as the rebel republic implemented the terms of the ceasefire agree- ment and removed barricades around Yugoslav federal army barracks. For their part, federal forces held their fire and lifted the naval blockade around Cro- atian ports. The start of the ceasefire had been marred on Sunday night by sporadic clashes in which three people died and 33 were wounded during fire-fights between Serb-Federal and Croat forces at Vukovar in eastern Croatia and Sisak in the centre of the rebel republic. The ceasefire accord, thrashed out between the Cro- atian government and Mr VeUko Kadijevic, the federal defence minister, appeared to be holding sufficiently to prompt moves to resume inter- national efforts to restore peace to the embattled repub- lic. Britain, France and Belgium last night sought formal back- ing. from the United Nations Security Council for a ceasefire appeal, in a resolution that would also order a ban on arms sales to Yugoslavia. Else- where, Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secre- tary, said he would reconvene the European Community's peace conference in The Hague on Thursday. The heads of the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU) earlier proposed sending a UN force to secure a ceasefire. In New York last night, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British for- eign secretary, said the Secu- rity Council would probably meet tomorrow at ministerial level and the prospects of a resolution being adopted were \"reasonably good\". This would also invite Mr Javier Pdrez de Cudllar, the UN sec- retary-general, to join the peace effort being conducted by the European Community and the WEU. The resolution would call under the mandatory tradi- tions of Chapter VII of the UN Charter for a \"complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equip- ment to Yugoslavia\" and request all states to take the necessary measures. All states would also be asked to refrain from any action that might contribute to an increase in tension in Yugoslavia. Mr Stipe Mesic, the Yugoslav president, who is also a Croat, is due to travel to New York today to urge the UN to send a peacekeeping force. Meanwhile, the degree of political control over federal troops and the respective Serb and Croat paramilitary units remained in question. Skir- mishes continued and many Serbian reservists refused to obey a call up by the federal army. Their reluctance prompted Serbia's ruling Socialist party, (formerly the Serbian league of communists), in a statement reflecting concern at growing signs of weariness with the fighting, to launch a fierce attack on \"traitors and fifth columnists in the opposition\".

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox YOU still can't take it with you, but your survivors can cut corners, and then be slow in paying the bills. PFK Hodgson Kenyon Inter- national, the UK's largest quoted funeral group, said yes- terday interim pre-tax profits had fallen from Â£6.3m to Â£3.5m, in spite of a 3 per cent increase in deaths. It blamed cheaper funerals and bad debts. Relatives have been sacrific- ing \"extras\" because of the recession, according to Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive. They might skip the Â£50 to Â£100 for embalming or \"hygienic services\" as PFK calls it, pick a pine coffin instead of mahog- any, and follow the hearse in their own car not a limousine. In Liverpool and elsewhere in northern England, where business is most sensitive to prices, PFK has held rises to the minimum. But mourners everywhere recoil from choosing the very cheapest. The popularity of PFK's basic funeral with no extras has been very low, even though it costs Â£400 compared with the national average of Â£745. With no apparent irony, Mr Hindley says the knack is to offer people the best packages. A robust 47, he took over ear- lier this year from the flamboy- ant Mr Howard Hodgson. Previously managing direc- tor of Pronuptia Young, Mr Hindley has spent much of his professional life dressing peo- ple for formal occasions. He sees undertaking as a classic challenge - a battle for share in a stagnant market. PFK's profits are sensitive to small fluctuations in the death rate. It pleaded lack of a Christmas fu epidemic when its 1990 profits fell. The 3 per cent rise in the death rate in the first half of this year remains unexplained, but good weather this summer is cred- ited with the recent small fall. But the UK death rate has remained remarkably stable at 1 per cent of the population. Little change is expected until the end of the century, when the demographic bulge pushes up the rate. PFK's new weapon in this tough market is Dignity in Destiny, a service to arrange the funeral of your choice - and pay for it - in advance. In the first half of 1991, PFK sold 2,500 Dignity plans, more than twice the rate for 1990. It attributes the rise to \"rec- ognising that it is just another financial service\" and offering the agents more commission. The problem is the reluctance of the living to hand over money when times are tight.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Marsh, Economics Staff MR Norman Lamont said last night that the \"clouds of reces- sion\" were beginning to lift, after government figures revealed record exports and a slowdown in the rate of con- traction in the economy. The chancellor was speaking at a dinner in Edinburgh, after the Central Statistical Office (CSO) said seasonally adjusted exports in August reached a record Â£9.1bn, up 3.5 per cent on July's figure. Separately, the CSO said the UK's gross domestic product decreased by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 1991, com- pared with the previous three months, a reduction on the revised 0.9 per cent decline in the first quarter. The data fit in with growing indications that the economy is likely to recover modestly in the second half of 1991, buttressed by a strong performance from man- ufacturing industry. The good record of exporters was highlighted by CSO fig- ures showing that in the three months to August, Britain had a trade surplus on manufac- Detall ..............................Page 9 A difficult hand for Lamont to play.............................. Page 22 tured goods of Â£100m, the first surplus on this part of the trade account since 1982. This was partly due to strong overseas sales of UK- produced goods and to a low figure in recent months for imports, demand for which has been restricted because of the recession. In August, however, imports rose by 4.5 per cent compared with July, to reach Â£9.9bn, the highest figure since July 1990, and another signal that the economy may be poised for an upturn. Much of the increase in imports was in goods such as chemicals and machinery which are used by industry. With the CSO projecting a surplus in invisible trade - services and various sinan- cial payments - of Â£200m for August, Britain had an overall current account deficit for the month of Â£500m, compared with Â£400m in July. Mr Lamont referred last night to recent increases in productivity as evidence that the economy was likely to bounce back quickly from the ercerssion However, the trade statistics cut little ice with Mr Gordon Brown, Labour trade and industry spokesman. He highlighted the underly- ing figure for the visible deficit - stripping out oil and erratic items such as gems and ships - and which in August was Â£l.lbn, little changed from July. I",

   "text_content" : "If the embattled Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton is out to jus- tify his recent remarks on eco- nomic recovery, he could do worse than point to yesterday's trade figures. Together with the latest manufacturing sur- vey from the Confederation of British Industry, they do pro- vide further evidence that the recession is ending. The ques- tion is whether a 4% per cent monthly rise in the value of imports at this stage in the cycle means recovery will be choked off by strain in the bal- ance of payments. So far, only a tiny majority of manufacturers expects to raise output, while 23 per cent still regard stocks as too high. Imports of consumer goods have declined over the past three months, with the overall rise in imports simply reflecting purchases of basic materials and capital goods as industry prepares for the upturn. That ought to make the financial markets worried about the potential for the trade balance to deteriorate should a robust recovery ever set in. There is only limited conso- lation in the strength of exports, even though manufac- turing trade is now in surplus for the first time since 1982. No doubt export performance will be improved by what promises to be a remarkable slowdown in unit labour costs. But it would be natural for exporters to exploit this improved com- petitiveness by repairing mar- gins that have been squeezed for several years now. More- over, a weak recovery in the US and slowdown in Germany will limit their ability to offset rising imports of consumer goods. The stolid reaction of the financial markets to the fig- ures yesterday could be because they believe that a wider trade deficit would be easily financed. A more likely explanation is that they do not believe in the prospect of a robust recovery in the first place. Lep There are not many compa- nies qualified to teach Mr Michael Ashcroft of ADT about adventurous accounting. The abrupt collapse of Lep's finances, however, is a salu- tary lesson for its largest shareholder. Granted, there is a prosaic explanation of Lep's need for a bail-out. Despite its heavy debt burden, it seems to have been remarkably slow in cutting costs and concentrat- ing on its central freight distri- bution business. Such has been FT-SE Index: 2,879. (-20.8) Lep Share price relative to the FT-A AIl-Share Index 200 150 100 50 0 \"1981 83 85 87 89 91 Source: Dalasraam the cash outflow in the first half that gross debt has jumped from Â£417m to more like Â£470m, more than half of which is short-term. Lep's banks, having exam- ined Its record, may yet decline to extend its credit facilities. Had the big London property development been consolidated in the group's accounts from the start, its true financial position would have been evi- dent several years ago. But Lep also persisted with other highly unconventional accounting policies, notably on its customer contracts. More credit and a sale of the US security business might allow Lep to survive. But after yesterday's 59 per cent fall in the share price, the prospect of an eventual rights issue has retreated. With no dividend to look forward to, shareholders have little reason to hang on. At least the market had woken up to Lep's high-risk juggling a while back, with the under- performance of the shares increasingly at odds with the annual compound 47 per cent rise in reported earnings since 1986. Markets At yesterday's close of 2,579.5, the FT-SE had fallen just 100 points from its all-time high of three weeks ago. In that period three obvious sac- tors have come into play: a revival of Tory standing in the polls, fresh evidence of eco- nomic recovery and the long- awaited return of bid activity. So far so normal, one might say. Having risen on the expec- tation, the market has fallen back on the reality. There have been offsetting influences as well: real or rumoured cash calls - Asda being a stark example of the latter - and the relentlessly gloomy tone of the interim results season. The political story has also reminded the market of the uncomfortable fact that there has to be an election. But none of that falls outside its rational expectations either. It is perhaps too much to infer from this that the bull market is about to resume. There are too many external variables, one being the rea- sonable likelihood of Wall Street proving still to be over- valued. But there are supports for the UK market as well. The sustained rise in gilts in recent weeks has brought the yield ratio back to the historically low level of 2.0, while the abso- lute yield on the All-Share is rising above the UK inflation rate for the first time since early 1988. Like the UK econ- omy itself, the equity market is likely to proceed from here in halting and inconsistent fash- ion. The underlying direction should be modestly upwards just the same. ECC Group Yesterday's interim figures from ECC could hardly have been better calculated to please the company's growing fan club. One reason for the less than feared 7 per cent slide in pre-tax profits was admittedly technical: a lessening of the second half bias due to the change of year end and the acquisition of Georgia Kaolin. The other was more fundamen- tal: higher operating margins due to the unexpectedly fast restructuring programme. For the moment, at any rate, ECC seems to be doing all the right things, rapidly shaking off the image of a dull and oversized business which had lost its way. The drive on costs has been spectacular, and by refusing to drop prices the group has shown not only that it can hold its market share but that it does not necessarily have to suffer the paper indus- try's sharp swings in fortune. Integrating the new North American operations still has some way to go, but the prize is both a dollar hedge and a wider spread of products. The problem for the shares, which have outperformed by 23 per cent over the last 12 months and added another lip to 469p yesterday, is not just the timing of the recovery. As RMC demonstrated last week and Tarmac will vividly illus- trate today, the building mate- rials sector is in a dreadful state. The depth of the struc- tural problems in ECC's operations is just one of the uncertainties which ought to make investors cautious in the short term."

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney FOSTER'S Brewing Group, which includes the Watney and Courage labels in the UK, and Cailton in Australia, yesterday reported 12- month losses after provisions and a weak performance by its brew- eries worldwide. The company, the former Elders IXL, made a net loss of AS43m (Â£19.7m) for the year ended June, 1991, after extraordi- nary losses of A$298m relating to the disposal of non-core assets and provisions against doubtful loans. After accounting for further extraordinary losses of A$1.64bn on disposals and unprofitable activities, mostly agribusiness and finance, Foster's losses at the bottom line totalled A$1.3bn. The group said net operating profits more than doubled to A$234m from A$104m, but the impact of recession in its main markets cut the contribution of the core brewing division to A$488m from A$513m last year. The directors said the result was \"a good performance\", but passed the final dividend for the second consecutive year. The shares lost 4 cents to A$1.78 on the Australian Stock Exchange. Mr Peter Bartels, who replaced Mr John Elliott as chief executive during the year, said Foster's attempts to restructure itself as a pure brewing group had been \"compromised\" by the depth of the recession. Mr Bartels said economic weakness in its main markets would continue to affect the group's ability to restructure itself in the current year. How- ever, the strength of the brewing operations augured well for future profitability. Foster's owns the Carlton brewing group in Australia, which brews Foster's and other lagers, the Courage and Grand Metropolitan breweries in the UK, and 50 per cent of Molson Breweries in Canada. Sales fell by 32 per 'cent to A$10.3bn, reflecting asset sales of A$1.7bn, mostly loss-making agri- cultural businesses. The group also reduced the loan book of its unprofitable finance subsidiary by A$708m to A$2.6bn. Foster's said it would continue to dispose of non-brewing assets \"in an orderly manner\". How- ever, analysts said it was unlikely to find buyers for the remaining agricultural and finance activities until the Aus- tralian economy recovered. UK brewing Interests show operating profits of A$168m Foster's UK brewing Interests, held through the Courage group, reported net operating profits of A$168m, compared with A$219m last year. However, the result was struck after utilising A$74m of provisions compared with A$167m last year. The provisions were set aside in 1988 to cover abnormal costs associated with the establishment of Courage Pub Company Hold- Ings (Pubco). Pubco, renamed Inntrepreneur Estates, is the holding company for the pubs formerly owned by Courage and Grand Metropolitan, the brew- ing groups whose breweries were merged by Foster's during the year. Inntrepreneur is half- owned by Courage. Foster's iald the assimila- tion of the Grand Metropolitan business was the group's main priority In the current year. However, Mr Peter Bartels, Fosters chief exec utive, maid Courage was \"proceeding quickly with the integration of the Grand Met brew eries\". The group said the acquisition of the Grand Metropolitan breweries had made Courage the second-largest brewer in the UK, with 21 per cent of the market, and positioned it for \"an increased push into continental Europe as these markets become more closely aligned in fatnre.\"",

   "text_content" : "A new nationalism in European stock markets has prompted a wave of reform, writes Richard Waters Until four l months ago, Europe's stock markets spent a lot of time get- ting cosy. They talked of the need for co-operation - of work- ing together to serve interna- tional investors and companies looking to raise capital overseas. The free movement of capital in Europe demanded a unified capi- tal market, they argued. Such rhetoric has now largely vanished. Instead, there is a new rallying cry for European bourses: \"Sauve qui peut!\" (every man for himself) Instead of co-operation, national markets are now fighting openly to pro- tect their own share of stock mar- ket trading as the securities busi- ness becomes increasingly international. Attempts at harmony evapo- rated last May when two years of work towards a joint venture trading system, Euroquote, was scrapped. The plan had been dead on its feet for some time because of fundamental disagree- ments about its purpose and a lack of desire on the part of some bourses to give way to London, which they feared would domi- nate the planned alliance. The death of Euroquote has returned attention to the reform of Europe's national stock mar- kets. All are scrapping old cartels and practices and introducing new trading systems to make themselves more attractive to the users and providers of capital. Part of the battle is to win business back on to organised stock markets. As much as 43 per cent of equity trading in Europe does not take place on stock mar- kets at all, or happens without being reported to market authori- ties, according to the Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC. These reforms are not new, having been under way in the main markets since the late 1980s, but the ending of the Euro- quote dream has given the reforms a new sense of urgency, as proven by a number of advances made this summer. In France, for example, a group of brokers under the chairman- ship of Mr Rend de la Serre, man- aging director of Credit Commer- cial de France, has proposed radical changes to make the Paris bourse more competitive internationally. In Germany, there seems finally to be some headway towards unifying the country's eight regional stock markets. And in London, the stock market authorities are feeling their way towards the creation on British soil of the same European Whole- sale Market that earlier this year they tried - unsuccessfully - to persuade other countries to join them in building. The first stage of the reform process is well in train in most countries, though far from com- plete. This is the wave of deregu- lation through which the old clubby ways of the various mar- kets are being unwound. Deregulation has taken a com- mon form: the ending of the monopolies enjoyed by small groups of brokers and dealers, and the admittance of banks to the official stock markets. As monopolies have gone, fixed com- missions have in some cases gone with them. he second stage of the pro- cess is still in its infancy: the re-regulation of national markets, and the devel- opment of new infrastructure to make all aspects of the trading and settlement of shares quicker, easier and cheaper. The move to greater regulation of national markets is a recogni- tion of the demands international investors place on free and open equity markets - something not previously accorded a high prior- ity in continental countries tradi- tionally attuned more by debt that equity financing. The re-regulation is taking place on a number of fronts: * The introduction of insider trading legislation, in accord with European law, and the development of tighter policing of markets. The revelations in Germany in recent weeks about dealing practices in some banks has confirmed the worst fears of investors and led to calls for tighter trading rules. * Tougher capital adequacy rules for broker/dealers. While the European Commission feels its way towards agreement on a unified system for assessing the capital backing of securities com- panies, national pressures are already at work in some coun- tries. In France, for example, the de la Serre committee, stirred into action by the collapse of the bro- ker Tuffier a year ago, has argued for tighter capital rules, and a strict segregation between the different activities of securi- ties companies. 0 The introduction of takeover rules to introduce Anglo/US-style protection for minority share- holders. In Switzerland, it is pro. posed that anyone buying more than,-athird of a company's shares should be forced to make a general offer to all the other shareholders. While such reforms are intended to instil greater confi- dence in international investors, moves to remodel national trad- ing arrangements are driven by a EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER Monthly total ($bn) Julo96 Aug1O0 Sfp0 Oct90 No0l0 Dec00 Belgium 1.10 1.36 0.74 0.83 0.78 0.60 France 18.20 21.93 15.84 16.00 14.83 18.08 Germany 97.32 90.96 51.97 82.48 60.54 52.00 Italy 17.21 17.90 9.14 10.68 7.32 8.84 Netherlands 6.60 10.11 6.31 6.32 6.20 4.23 Spain 8.29 5.32 3.86 4.62 4.96 6.43 Sweden 2.10 2.90 2.70 2.60 2.10 2.30 Switzerland 10.84 7.75 7.75 9.55 7.17 6.49 UK 51.53 56.72 40.12 55.17 48.77 45.73 Sourcem County NeWen Jan'91 Feb'91 Mar'91 Apr91 May'91 Jun'91 Jul'91 Aug'91 0.71 1.32 1.30 1.29 1.10 1.09 0.96 0.86 15.73 20.57 19.19 19.07 15.04 18.88 17.18 14.77 55.13 79.20 72.44 73.65 69.38 78.65 63.09 58.77 7.81 13.69 11.93 9.75 10.56 10.96 6.71 5.72 6.62 8.08 8.00 7.38 6.26 5.11 .5.47 5.74 5.38 7.82 7.63 6.17 6.66 5.69 5.77 5.22 4.00 4.00 4.00 3.00 3.50 3.00 2.70 3.20 9.56 10.72 9.59 10.13 8.29 8.04 6.18 6.35 48.24 60.87 64.30 54.76 44.76 43.38 54.21 49.50 perceived need to make local stock markets cheaper and easier. In some cases, national mar- kets are being created for the first time. In Germany and Swit- zerland pressure from the small number of banks that dominate the securities business seems to be leading inevitably towards the unification of regional exchanges. Not all the sparkling new elec- tronic trading systems will suc- ceed. The German exchanges have experimented with two ver- sions of an electronic system, IBIS, and appointed McKinsey, the management consultants, to advise on the next generation of technological wizardry to give them a leg-up in the battle for market share in trading Euro- pean equities. Part of the argument for scrap- ping Euroquote was that it was too expensive and did not justify the investment. There is a danger now, though, that each national market will spend far more try- ing on its own to build a version of a cross-border trading system, and that the pay-back will be a long time in coming. A series of articles on progress in individual European countries will appear on the International Capital Markets pages in future issues.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper COMPAGNIE Francaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (Coface), the state- owned French trade credit insurer, has acquired a 3 per cent stake in Trade Indemnity, the troubled UK trade insurer. The group insists that the acquisition, which was announced yesterday following recent purchases on the market, is for purely \"investment pur- poses\". About 24 per cent of the UK trade Insurer's stock trades on a regular basis. A number of insurers, includ- ing Swiss Re, the Zurich-based reinsurer, and Guardian Royal Exchange, hold the remaining 76 per cent of the company's equity. Trade Indemnity's share price closed at 68p yesterday following news last week that it had been badly hit by recession-related claims. Following full-year losses of Â£28.8m during 1990 and the pros- pect of further losses this year, TI said it was unable to declare an interim dividend. Yesterday's move by Coface sparked speculation that it may be a shot in a much wider battle for control of the European trade credit insurance market. One of Coface's European rivals, NCM of the Netherlands, has already increased its share of the UK market, while there are indications that Munich Re, which with Allianz, the German insurer, controls Hermes, the German trade credit insurer, may be developing closer links with TI itself. Earlier this year NCM won control of the Insurance Services Group, the short-term export credit arm of the Export Credit Guarantee Department which is being privatised by the UK gov- ernment. The government accepted NCM's bid ahead of rival offers from TI and Generali, the Italian insurer. Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, bought an 8 per cent stake in TI when Prudential, which had previously owned the stake, refused to back a rights issue. In July, Hermes pulled out of the UK trade credit market one year after entering it. Commenting on Coface's possi- ble motives one insurer said yes- terday: \"Maybe they feel they need to get a tangible feel for what UK trade credit underwrit- ers are doing. Following the acquisition by Munich Re they also feel they should have a stake. It is a little bit coinciden- tal.\"",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller MAI, the financial services and market research concern, yes- terday revealed pre-tax profits slightly more than maintained at Â£66.3m, against Â£65.6m, in the year to June 30. Profits were held with the help of strong growth in the North American broking businesses and a fillip from interest income. Turnover declined to Â£361.5m (Â£376.7m). Operating profit fell to Â£45.6m (Â£50.7m). The turnround in the inter- est position was worth more than Â£llm. Mr Clive Hollick, managing director, said that net cash had grown to Â£100m (Â£60m). The main influx came from the reduction of MAI's stake in Avenir, the French media business, but the group had also generated cash. The remaining 15.5 per cent holding in Avenir was worth Â£60m, reflecting the effects of recession. Mr Hollick said that of the Â£10.4m fall in media operating profit, one third was caused by Avenir's underlying performance and two thirds by the reduced stake - MAI used to have 32 per cent. The group's \"ambitious pro- gramme of development\" included broadcasting and financial information. MAI is a majority holder in Meridian, which has bid for the ITV franchise held by TVS Entertainment. The incumbent is believed to have bid Â£20m a year more than its nearest rival. MAI also has 20 per cent of Daybreak which, like Sun- rise, its rival, has outbid TV-am for the breakfast televi- sion franchise. Decisions are expected in mid-October, but Mr Hollick said that even if neither of MAI's vehicles succeeded, it would seek to get into broad- casting some other way. The bidding had cost Â£1.5m. \"It gets seriously expensive at the next stage,\" he said. The other avenue for growth, financial information, meant exploiting the global price information already available to the group's broking arms. Some acquisitions might be made to further development. The money and securities broking businesses provided nearly 60 per cent of pre-tax profit with Â£39.6m (Â£36.6m), in spite of bearing the brunt of a Â£5m exchange rate reverse. Despite the weakening dollar, the North American operations contributed Â£27.8m (Â£22.3m). Mr Hollick said the improve- ment came from revenue growth, gains in market share and increased efficiency through investment in technol- ogy. Although the Gulf war had dampened trading in the first half, falling interest rates had stimulated the securities wing. Turnover again increased in foreign exchange. In retail financial services, pre-tax profit fell to Â£6.9m (Â£9.3m) as Wagon, offering credit for car purchases, was affected by falling vehicle sales and bad debts. Safeguard, which was 90 per cent involved in motor insurance, had started to see some benefit from increased premiums. The market research compa- nies did less bespoke business for individual companies, while the syndicated work held up better. Mr Hollick, who is a Labour peer, said he would not be dis- tracted from his business duties by a general election, but he was looking forward to an election boost for NOP, the polling subsidiary. Earnings per share grew to 12.6p (12p). A final dividend of 4.1p makes a total of 5.5p (5p).",

The group blamed the fall, from Â£6.6m to Â£3.9m, on the low level of corporate and property finance activities due to the economic downturn. Group turnover fell from Â£75.6m to Â£52.2m. However, the group's cash position improved during the first six months of the year and the three divisions are expec- ted to remain cash positive throughout the year. Earlier in the year the group it sold its broking interests to Inchcape for Â£8.5m. Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said: \"Our results are slightly better than the sec- ond six months of 1990 which shows we have bottomed out and recovery is round the cor- ner.\" Rutland widened the share- holder base of Capital Ven- tures, an unquoted subsidiary, which launched a successful hostile bid for for Harcourt Group, the loss-making packag- ing company. Following the relisting of the combined group, which will be renamed Capital Industries, Rutland owns 37.4 per cent of the enlarged equity. The dividend is held at 0.27p. Earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 0.88p.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy MR ROBERT MAXWELL and the BBC appeared to be on a collision course last night after the televising of a Pan- orama programme revealing the results of a six-month Investigation into some of the publisher's reported business practices. The programme, called The Max Factor, looked In particu- lar at potential influences on the share price of Mr Max- wel's main quoted company, Maxwell Communication Cor- poration, last October. The Panorama programme was viewed and cleared at the highest editorial level within the BBC by Mr John Birt, the Corporation's director general designate. The programme listed a number of developments last October which could have influenced the level of MCC shares. One was the Issuing of press releases on the sale or negotiations for sale of Panini, the Italian publisher of chil- dren's stickers, and PS Collier, MCC's American encyclopae- dia business. Panorama regarded the press releases about deals which subsequently did not go ahead as \"over-optimistic.\" A second factor, according to Panorama, was a \"put option\" in which Mr Maxwell guaranteed, if required, to buy more than 15m MCC shares just after the closed period for his company. The put option was sold to Goldman Sachs who exercised it at the end of the closed period selling Mr Maxwell over 15m MCC shares. But during the second week of October 1991 various Goldman Sachs interests were holding 47m MCC shares. Panorama argued that taken together the optimistic press releases, the put option span- ning the closed period and the large share stake held by Gold- man Sachs \"distorted the mar- ket in MCC shares last autumn.\" In a personal comment in the Sunday Mirror on Sunday Mr Maxwell attacked what he called the \"jackals of the BBC\" and accused Panorama of try- ing to get former employees to \"dish dirt\" in breach of com- mercial confidentiality agree- ments. \"The chairman, Marmaduke Hussey, the director general, Michael Checkland, and his deputy, John Birt, are the three monkeys of broadcast- in: they want to hear noth- ing, see nothing and say noth- ing,\" Mr Maxwell wrote. Mr Maxwell declined to take part in the programme after \"the BBC failed to give any guarantee of fair and unbiased treatment of the answers.\" Panorama said it invited Mr Maxwell to take part but \"he did not agree to the BBC's nor- mal conditions for interview.\"",

   "text_content" : "For Lep shareholders, forewarned is not necessarily forearmed, says Richard Gourlay EW OBSERVERS were expecting that Lep'A first-half profits would make joyful reading when they are announced on Wednesday. But when the security and freight forwarding company yesterday revealed that profits had fallen fivefold from last time, even the pessimists were shocked. The market immediately slashed lap's share price from 87p to 36p, less than a fifth of the 201p high it reached a little more than a year ago. As one analyst said, if ever there was a case for sparing your share- holders from surprises, this was it. To some extent Lep fell vic- tim to the weekend leak that it had been forced to refinance its Â£470m debt. Mr John Read, chairman, had hoped to announce the pre-tax profits fall from Â£10.4m to Â£1.9m with news that the banks had refinanced and increased the company's facili- ties by Â£40m. Instead he has been left with the uncomfortable knowledge that crucial bank signatures remain missing from the refi- nancing agreement. He said yesterday that there was nothing in yesterday's profits warning of which the banks were not already aware and that the refinancing was on track. The announcement also demonstrates how badly Lep needs the sale of National Guardian, its US-based security company - it says it is negoti- ating the sale with a number of parties. Without the sale, gear- ing is likely to remain above 200 per cent and the final divi- John Read: we would have a good month and then we would be surprised by a bad one dend could go the way of yes- terday's cancelled interim pay- ment. Mr Read says the final divi- dend will be decided next year in the light of the 1992 trading outlook, the results and the debt level. The sale of National Guard- ian - for an amount Lep hopes will be in the region of $300m (Â£177.5m) plus its debt of $150m - would refocus the group after a decade-long foray into security. But, until that sale goes through, analysts are likely to continue casting a cautious eye over some of Lep's accounting practices. These include: 0 Lep's choice not to amortise its security alarm business over the life of the contracts. Doing so would lead to a charge through the profit and loss account. Indeed in last year's accounts, Lep actually revalued its contracts by Â£20.5m. Compared to the approach taken by ADT, which amortises contracts over their life of 7-13 years, analysts say Lep's approach is less than conservative. Mr Read says that the vast majority of con- tracts are renewed and that only if the value of contracts falls below cost is an excep- tional charge made to the profit and loss account. * Property write-downs, apart from a Â£20m provision on a Lep Share pdrice (pence) 200 180 160 140 120 100 g 40 1988 89 90 91 Source: osltream specific Californian invest- ment, were not mentioned in yesterday's profits warning. Again last year, Lep actually increased the value of its prop- erty investments. Mr Read said this was consistent with what the company had done for the past four years and was the result of write-downs in UK property in 1990 being more than offset by revaluations abroad. Revaluations in the UK would be re-examined during the second half, he said. Mr Read also rejected the criticism yesterday that Lep had been slow to warn the market about the much reduced first-half profits. In April, when he told sharehold- ers that Lep was making \"sat- isfactory progress\", it repre- sented the company's view at the time. \"The scenario was that we would have a good month and then we would be surprised by a bad month,\" he said. \"Much to many people's surprise, the recession did not bottom out.\"",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard CONTROL OF Sansui Group, the Far Eastern consumer elec- tronics subsidiary of Polly Peck International, may pass into the hands of Grande Hold- ings of Hong Kong, under a plan due to be submitted to Sansui's board in Tokyo on Thursday. Mr Michael Jordan of Coo- pers & Lybrand Deloitte, the senior Polly Peck administra- tor, flies to Tokyo today with a plan to sell a strategic stake in Sansui to Dr Stanley Ho, the chairman of Grande Holdings. In return Grande Holdings will make a substantial cash injec- tion into Sansui whose losses this year are expected to pass the $28m mark. Grande will be given an option to acquire a controlling interest later. The plan has been approved by Mr Norbert Wirsching, the director of Capetronics, the Taiwan-based electronics components manu- facturer with which Sansui was merged last year. However, it has already run into opposition from the San- sui board. They are believed to have told the administrators that some features of the plan may not be possible under Jap- anese regulations. The urgent financial plight of Sansui, which has made a loss for the last five years, makes some sort of buy-out urgent. Polly Peck acquired its 72 per cent stake in Sansui after the Japanese banks indi- cated that they were not will- ing to continue backing San- sui. Contacted in London yester- day, Mr Jordan confirmed that he was going to Tokyo with a rescue plan for Sansui but declined to give further details. He said that he would be putting plans for the future of Polly Peck's main subsidiary, Del Monte Fresh Fruits, to a meeting of the group's credi- tors on October 8. The administrators have not yet decided whether they should sell a minority offering in Del Monte Fresh Fruits to a partner or seek a public offering on the New York stock exchange. \"We are reviewing the options and our preferred route could be a public offering,\" Mr Jordan said. The administrators are also negotiating with a buy-out pro- posal headed by Mr Greg Aziz, an American lawyer, but Mr Aziz's offer seems to be viewed less favourably than the possi- ble stock exchange flotation. One feature of the flotation plan is that it would oblige Polly Peck to publish a full set of accounts, audited to Ameri- can standards. The administrators are close to overcoming a disagreement with Mr Willy Braunz, the Ger- man businessman and former owner of Fruco, Polly Peck's German fruit subsidiary. Mr Braunz sold Fruco for shares instead of cash in 1989 and it has not been possible to pro- ceed with the sale of the com- pany earlier. Once the dispute with Mr Braunz is out of the way, Fruco may be sold to Albert Fisher, another fruit trader, for about Â£9m.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox PFG HODGSON Kenyon International, the UK's largest quoted undertaker, saw interim profits fall sharply from Â£6.3m to Â£3.5m. More people died in the half- year to end-June, but the reces- sion held back funeral prices and pushed up bad debts and interest costs. The 8 per cent rise in turn- over to Â£282m (Â£26m) was due to a 4 per cent rise in funeral prices, a 3 per cent rise in the death rate, and the contribu- tion of the three memorial and funeral businesses bought last year for about Â£750,000. The group's average funeral price is now Â£745. It held back prices in the north but put them up in line with inflation in London and the south east. Mr Peter Hindley, chief exec- utive, said that customers were cutting back on extras such as embalming, and choosing To compete at the bottom of the market, PHK had intro- duced a basic service for Â£400 with no limousine, no \"hygenic services\" and a basic pine cos- fin. Operating profits fell to Â£5.5m (Â£7.9m) from a Â£3.1m rise in administrative costs, includ- ing a Â£400,000 rise in bad-debt provisions. 50 redundancies, taking staff numbers down to 1,500, cost Â£700,000. Although tighter cash con- trol had pulled debt down since the year end by Â£3m to Â£29m, higher average cash balances in the period pushed interest payable to Â£2m (Â£1.5m). Includ- ing the preference dividend of Elm, the interest cover fell to 1.8 from 3.1. Mr Hindley said that the recession made cash control more difficult as it was much harder to get debtors to pay. An extraordinary charge of Â£250,000 reflected the uncer- tainty about recovering money due on the 1989 sale of memo- rial businesses. The death rate had fallen by 2.2 per cent in the past two months because of good weather, but Mr Hindley thought that it would stay sta- ble for the next five years. Fully-diluted earnings fell to 4.3p (7.5p). The interim divi- dend is cut to Ip (2.lp) \"reflecting the group's current emphasis on cost control\".",

SRodime, which announced last month that it would cease manufacturing disc drives to become a licensor of technol- ogy, said it is still pursuing patent claims against another 28 manufacturers, mostly in Asia and the US. Rodime said the agreement with the Japanese companies covered both future royalty payments and compensation for previous uses of its technol- ogy.

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller POLYPIPE, the Doncaster-based maker of plas- tic pipes and fittings, nudged up pre-tax profits by 3.5 per cent from Â£13.4m to Â£13.9m in the 12 months to June 30. It also just about managed to keep earnings moving ahead at 13.26p (13.25p) after a Â£13.6m share placing in the spring to pay for acquisitions, notably a garden furniture company called Oasis. The purchases contributed Â£500,000 to pre-tax profit and Â£llm to sales of Â£81.2m (Â£70.8m). By the end of the year the amount of cash held had gone up from Â£5m to Â£12m, after cap- ital spending of Â£8m, similar to the previous year. Interest received fell to Â£200,000 (Â£300,000). Mr Bryan Stock, who recently joined the com- pany as finance director from Bardon Group, said an over- draft had been run up before the placing cash came in. Mr Kevin McDonald, chair- man and managing director, said no substantial revival in demand was expected until next year. The group's investment to ensure low-cost production had borne fruit. It also benefited from lower raw material prices in the second half of the year. Mr Vic Roberts, marketing director, said that although demand was reduced for plas- tic pipes \"above and below ground\", market share had been gained. In the first three months of this financial year volumes were up by 8 to 9 per cent. Extending the product range and attracting new customers had helped dampen the impact of recession. Polypipe was moving into the civil engineering field via the production of sewer pipes. Another promising area was television cable ducting. Since June, the group had paid Â£2.5m to Spring Ram for the Fordham cistern business, formerly part of Hepworth. Fordham would be merged with Derwent MacDee at Don- caster. An earlier acquisition, Premier Profiles, had been combined with Procell, Poly- pipe'e established window parts business. A final dividend of 2.55p makes a total of 3.75p (3.5p). The group is planning a 1-for-l scrip issue. * COMMENT As Polypipe is number two in the UK behind Wavin, a Shell subsidiary, it was bound to sus- ser to some extent from reces- sion, even though new build only accounts for 12 per cent of sales.

Oasis also gives the group valuable contacts with the big DIY chains. With another difficult year in pros- pect, acquisitions will play an important role in moving prof- its ahead for the seventh year since flotation. The group's market value has multiplied about 13 times. A pre-tax profit advance to between Â£15m and Â£15.5m is forecast, although earnings are expected to remain flat because of addi- tional equity. On yesterday's close of 208p, the prospective multiple is nearly 16. Long-term growth prospects remain healthy.",

The outcome was struck after reduced investment income of Â£796,000 (Â£1.05m), reflecting lower interest rates on sterling deposits, which masked an 11 per cent improvement to Â£1.67m in oper- ating profits. Funds under management increased from Â£1.41bn to Â£1.89bn over the period, two thirds of which came from increases in the value of exist- ing client portfolios with the balance from new clients. Turnover, including net prof- its from unit trust trading, amounted to Â£4.77m (Â£431m). The interim dividend is raised from 4.5p to 5p payable from earnings of 9.5p (9.6p). Aspen Comms down steeply to Â£1.15m Aspen Communications, the USM-quoted printing and media gi-oup, announced a steep drop in profits from Â£2.78m to Â£1.15m before tax for the six months ended June 30. Turnover was down from Â£31.9m to Â£28m and earnings per share fell from 14.5p to 5.6p, but the interim dividend was maintained at 2.7p. Mr Harry Meakin, chairman, said \"there are no discernible positive sales trends at present although enquiry levels have improved. But we remain con- sident that, given stable eco- nomic conditions in 1992, the group will be able to show gen- eral improvements.\" Hawtal dips sharply as margins erode Hawtal Whiting Holdings reported sharply reduced interim profits as the motor industry recession took its toll. The pre-tax outcome at the Essex-based vehicle engineer- ing consultancy dropped from 8K34,000 to Â£178,000 at June 30. Turnover, however, improved by some 5 per cent to Â£30m (28.4m). The well-reported problems of the industry have led to \"significant over-capacity\" in the group's sector. \"We have suffered from an erosion of our gross margins as the majority of our customers have sought to reduce their costs,\" said Mr John Whitecross, chairman. Interest charges fell to Â£852,000 (Â£1.07m). After tax of Â£146,000 (Â£285,000) and minori- ties Â£81,000 (Â£85,000) the group incurred losses of 0.67p (earn- ings of 3.62p) per share. J Bllam pessimistic over second half J Billam, the sheet metal engi- neer and cutting tools special- ist, saw profits increase from Â£73,000 to Â£109,000 in the six months to June 30 after lower exceptional charges of Â£107,000 (Â£176,000) related to termina- tion costs. Mr Stephen Ingram, chair- man, pointed out that the engi- neering sector was suffering the deepest recession for over 50 years and that Billam was not immune to that. Current indications were that trading in the current half year would be more difficult than in the first half. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.64p from earn- ings of 4.5p (2.9p). Mr Ingram said that tighter cash management had resulted in a significant reduction in gearing from 70 per cent at the end of 1990 to 51 per cent at June 30. Hibernian expands as profits near Â£3m Hibernian Group, the Dublin- based insurance company, has reached agreement to acquire the 2.6m ordinary shares of Hibernian Life Association held by the Life Association of Scotland. Hibernian, which already owned the other 50 per cent of the share capital, is to pay IS8m (Â£7.3m) in cash for the stake. The announcement coin- cided with the release of the group's interim statement for the six months to end-June, during which pre-tax profits surged from IE61,000 to I12.84m. Premium income grew to IE73.9m (IE68.8m) and invest- ment income was ahead at IÂ£14m (IE13.6m). Underwriting losses were reduced from IE13.5m to IEll.lm mainly as a result of an improvement in motor business. Earnings came out at 3.5p (0.07p) and the interim divi- dend is raised to 1.9p (1.75p).",

However, growth has slowed from 3 and 20 per cent respec- tively at the previous two interim stages. \"We have to run that much further just to stand still,\" said Mr Eric Moore, managing director. A three-year capital expendi- ture programme had paid off by \"allowing us to take the orders that others could not,\" he said. The group spent more than Â£lm on capital expenditure in the first half, about half the amount incurred last time. A broadened customer base and new products - such as the \"dry fry\" pan which does not use oils - had also helped maintain profits. Metalrax specialises in stor- age products, industrial and commercial structures such as partitioning, housewares, which include cooking uten- sils, and components. All divisions had performed as expected, he said. Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased slightly to Â£31.9m (Â£31.4m), with a 50/50 split between the product side and component manufacturing. The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to Ip and earnings per share rose 3 per cent after a scrip issue in May and a reduced tax charge. Cash in the bank stood at Â£4m, compared to Â£3.5m last time. Metalrax, which in recent years has grown rapidly through acquisition, said some purchasing options were under review. There were no acquisi- tions in the first half. Gross margins were main. tained at more than 10 per cent, and the order books had held up well, Mr Moore said. For the full year, Mr Moore said: \"We are looking to keep our nose in front of last year.\" The group turned in pre-tax profits of Â£7.1m for 1990.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Provisions Leave Bryant down 49%",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent FOR THE second year in succession Bryant Group has joined the rising tide of house- builders and property develop- ers which have announced sub- stantial provisions. The group yesterday announced a 49 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Â£20.1m to Â£10.1m for the 12 months to end-May. The figures were struck after a provision of Â£12m, the same as the previous year, to cover potential losses on housebuild- ing and property develop- ments. The total dividend for the year is maintained at 4.8p with an unchanged final of 3.4p. Earnings per share slipped from 6.2p to 3.4p leaving the dividend uncovered. Mr Chris Bryant, chairman said: \"This has been a frustra- ting year for all our activities due to the economic recession, high interest rates and lack of consumer confidence. It is diffi- cult to detect any real indica- tor that the situation has begun to improve.\" The group expected the UK economy to recover only slowly. It therefore had felt it \"prudent to make a provision of approximately Â£8m in respect of certain homes sites in the south of England and Â£4m against property develop- ments.\" Profits from housebuilding had fallen sharply despite a 16 per cent increase, to 1,865, in house sales. Mr Michael Chapman, said that gearing would rise from 5 per cent at the end of May to no more than 25 per cent as a result of land purchases. He said that the group's non- housing activities, contracting and commercial property development, slid slightly. This, given the state of the property market, represented a good performance. Margins in contracting had deteriorated as private build- ing work had declined in southern England. About two thirds of the group's construc- tion workload was generated in the Midlands compared with only one third in the south. Mr Bryant yesterday announced that he would be retiring as chairman of the group a year earlier than planned. He intends to step down at the group's annual meeting next year. Mr Bryant has been invited to become life president of the company. * COMMENT Bryant is not the only house- builder which has been required to make a second tranche of provisions. Like oth- ers, it is paying the price for having bought land expen- sively in the late 1980s when the housing market was at its peak. Barratt, when it announces its results later this week, will unveil provisions of about Â£80m for the year to the end of June. Bryant, in its favour, has little debt. It there- fore should be well placed to take advantage of the housing recovery when it comes. Improvement, however, is likely to be slow while prop- erty and contracting will con- tinue to find life difficult. Prof- its for the current year are likely to be only a little higher than last year's pre-provision level of Â£22.3m. This puts the group on a prospective p/e of just over 17 which suggests that recovery prospects are already in the share price.

The shares fell 2p to 5p on the news yesterday, a drop of 75 per cent in three weeks. An industry analyst said that most of Grovewood's prob- lems stemmed from the Â£5m Priest Marians purchase. \"Can- celling the interim dividend was a sensible thing to do,\" he added. The group is considering a Â£15m rights issue to raise its equity capital, a precondition to any refinancing agreements. It said it would not be able to meet interest payments on the 8 per cent convertible unse- cured loan stock due on Sep- tember 30 1991. Grovewood has issued a writ against James Capel, which advised Priest Marians in the Â£110m takeover of Local Lon- don Group, the property com- pany, in 1989. Grovewood claims that Capel underestimated Local London's debts at the time of the take- over, and that as a result Priest Marians had suffered a net loss of Â£57m by March 31 1990.

Richmond had delayed otting its results to hareholders until the deal could be com- pltesd. Richmond said yesterday that it had agreed not to name the purchaser of the San Juan interests, although it is known to be a US company. Initially, the company had Intended to sell a 75 per cent stake In the San Juan Basin. However, the deal covers all the group's interests there. \"We are pleased to have agreed on terms for this trans- action,\" said Mr Michael Hogue, joint managing direc- tor. Negotiations had been under way for about two months. The shares, which have fallen from a peak of 178p just over a year ago, picked up to close p higher at 25p. Richmond's Interests in the San Juan Basin are valued in the balance sheet at $17.2m. The gain will be taken as an exceptional item in the group's first half results to the end of September 1991. Shareholders' funds before the sale were Â£49.7m. \"It was always our intention to sell San Juan,\" said Mr David Wilkinson, Joint manag- ing director. Richmond had been unable to use tax credits associated with the San Juan interests. Following the sale, Rich- mond will be left holding just one of the four main proper- ties with which it came to the market in July 1969 - Rich- mond Ranch. The group has had to curtail development of this property until the liquidity problems were solved. However, the company said yesterday that it would move ahead with pro- posed long-term plans for the ranch. The San Juan deal would certainly help the devel- opment of that property, said Mr Hogue. Richmond has said that it plans to explore the possibility of a joint venture to develop the ranch.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lappet LLOYD THOMPSON, the insurance and reinsarance bro- ker, yesterday reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Â£11.26m for the year to June 30 1991. 1 The increase was well ahead of expectations aid immedi- ately buoyed the share price which rose by 10p tP finish the day at 424p. Turnover grew iby 38 per cent to Â£29.7m (Â£2216m), ahead .of a 35 per cent rise in expenses to Â£24.26m (Â£17.9m), while investment income rose by some 22 per cent to Â£5.68m. Earnings per shhre - on a fully diluted basis .- increased by 33 per cent to 19.9p (15p). A increased dividend of 9p (7.5p) is declared - a rise of 20 per cent. Mr Ken Carter, chief execu- tive, acknowledged that marine insurancl rates were hardening but indicated that the increase in revenues was due to the develotment of new business, especially in the non- marine area. Nearly 50 per cent of the group's brokerage income was generated by its, core marine insurance business, with income rising from Â£11.3m to Â£14.6m. Despite softness in property rates brokerage from interna- tional, property and casualty business rose by 20 per cent to Â£5.8m (f3.6m). Reinsurance, political and financial risks business gener- ated revenues of Â£9.3m (Â£6.7m), with the increase partly due to hardening of reinsurance mar- kets. The directors are proposing a capitalisation issue of one new ordinary share of 5p for each existing ordinary share. Mr Carter said that this was designed to increase the liquid- ity in the share and ease trad- ing by institutions. 0 COMMENT Yesterday's powerful perfor- mance by Lloyd Thompson - achieved in the face of adverse exchange and interest rate trends - seems certain to seal the broker's reputation as a favourite among investors. Revenues can be expected to grow strongly over the the next 12 months, especially since Lloyd Thompson is in a good position to benefit from hardening in marine insurance rates, particularly in the energy sector where a number of important contracts have already been renewed at appre- ciably higher rates. The group is well hedged against a further weakening in the dollar and now seems to have costs under control fol- lowing its move to more expen- sive premises last year. This year the expense ratio (which measures expenses as a percentage of brokerage income) was cut by 2 percent- age points to 81. The only worries are possi- bilities that reduced capacity in the marine reinsurance mar- ket may depress income in London while the group's energy division could lose out to domestic competition in the US. Even so profits can be expec- ted to grow by at least 20 per cent this year to an estimated Â£13.5m, a figure which would put the shares on a prospective p/e of 19.5. Although that is above the rating for the sector, it is below the group's historic p/e of 21, indicating that there is consid- erable scope for a further rise in the share price. Indeed it is difficult to see the downside.",

   "text_content" : "By Anthony Moreton, Welsh Correspondent SOUTH WALES Electricity's first annual meeting since December's privatisation was 31 minutes old yesterday before the two dreaded words were uttered. Mr Wynford; Evans, chair- man, had spent 20 minutes over a bullish report in which he had commented on low bor- rowings, the development of related businesses, the move into power generation in a new station on Teesside \"with strong partners\", the develop- ment of the physical network and rationalisation of shops. He had easily fielded ques- tions on energy conservation, higher charges and water- power generation when Mr Dennis Colville, of Penhow, Gwent, uttered the words Welsh Water. , \"Would SwAlec buy into I I I - - - - Welsh Water as Water had invested in Swalec?\" he asked. \"No,\" Mr Evans categorically stated. \"We have no intention of investing in Welsh Water,\" he added for emphasis. \"Such shareholdings do not give any influence on policy.\" The comment was directed as much against Welsh Water as towards Mr Colville. Water has built an unwelcome 14.9 per cent stake in Swalec, lead- ing to fears that Mr John Elfed Jones, its chairman, is seeking one day to take over Swalec and create a Wales plc. Water has sought a seat on Swalec's board on the back of the stake but yesterday dropped this approach even though it continues to believe considerable synergy would come from closer co-operation between the two. Mr Evans admitted there had been talks - \"at our instiga- tion\" - between the two com- panies before privatisation. These had nothing to do with cross shareholdings, he stated. \"Our job is to get our busi- ness to perform as well as we can,\" he added. \"There are big- ger benefits by concentrating on our company than going in any other direction.\" The only other events to dis- turb the calm were a share- holder objecting to the 90 per cent salary rises to directors and another who complained, in Welsh, that the late running of Cardiffs buses had led to his delayed arrival. But he continued to cheers, and in English, he was going to buy more shares. It was that sort of meeting.",

He added that he was confident about the group's short- and longer-term prospects. He stressed that the figures for the 1990 first half were not strictly comparable as they include discontinued operations and only one month of trading for Rockport Pub- lishers. That said, turnover of this US-registered publishing, mar- keting support and production services group was down at Â£14.6m (Â£1519m), though strip- ping out discontinued activi- ties revealed a 3 per cent rise. Earnings 'were static at 4.5p per share basic and at 5p diluted. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.6125p (1.5p). Mr Orbach said that the harsh economic environment had claimed a number of Quarto's competitors and that the group had to some extent benefited from their misfor- tunes.

Turnover rose to IÂ£32.8m (IM30.6m) and earnings per share to 1239p (10.2O restated for the 1-sor-I scrip issue). The directors recommended a final dividend of 2275p (1875p) for a total of Sp (25p).

Engineeringlenvironment revenues had also been expec- ted to show an improvement in the fourth quarter over the third, but the US companies had not experienced the cus- tomary surge in demand from the US construction industry due to the continued recession. Pre-tax profits for the whole of 1989-90 totalled Â£19m. Exports lift Fortnum to Â£318,000 Pre-tax profits at Fortnum & Mason, the department store group, rose to Â£318,000 for the 24 weeks to July 13. The outcome compared with Â£185,000 in the comparable period which covered the 28 weeks to August 11 1990. Sales totalled Â£9.49m against Â£10.9m but on a comparable 24 week basis were marginally ahead. The increase was directly attributable to another strong first half performance by the export department which recorded a 49 per cent increase to Â£2.59m. Sales in the Piccadilly store were 10 per cent down to Â£6.9m. The recov- ery in sales was said to be slow and patchy. Earnings emerged at 48.5p, compared with 26.8p. The interim dividend is increased from 6p to 10p. Holmes & Marchant warns on profits The share price of Holmes & Marchant, the marketing con- sultancy, fell from 99p to 88p after the group issued a profits warning.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto ONEX Corp, the Toronto-based management group, is selling its 70 per cent stake in Beatrice Foods, Canada's leading dairy products company, to a group of investors assembled by Mer- rill Lynch, the US securities firm. Merrill Lynch Capital Part- ners (MLCP), which specialises in putting together partner- ships of large institutional investors, is paying C$475m (US$416.6m) in cash for Bea- trice, subject to financing arrangements and regulatory approvals. Onex bought Beatrice in 1987 in one of a series of highly-le- veraged acquisitions which have given it a diverse stable of investments, including pack- aging, airline catering and a leading courier service. Since then, Beatrice has strengthened its position in the dairy market with two sizeable. acquisitions. The company earned C$50.3m last year on sales of C$746m. An. 11 per cent rise in revenues was due largely to the purchase of Palm Dairies of Alberta. Mr Anthony Melman, Onex vice-president, said yesterday the company had been examining alternatives for Beatrice, including a public listing and the sale of a minority stake. Onex will receive C$115m from the sale, compared with its initial investment of C3SOm. The disposal will boost Onex's cash reserves to about C$215m. Mr Melman said Onex, which made a name for itself in the 1980s as Canada's master of the leveraged buyout, did not have any immediate plans for other acquisitions or disposals. Onex suffered a C$19.8m loss last year, but was back in the black in the first half of 1991. MLCP said yesterday it was attracted to Beatrice by its brand name and products. Beatrice no longer has any direct connection, however, with the US dairy products company of the same name. MLCP, whose investors include pension funds and other financial institutions, has completed 32 deals worth a total of US$17bn since its formation 10 years ago. Its portfolio includes stakes in automotive parts-maker Borg Warner and fashion retailer Ann Taylor.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Financial Staff CIMENTS Francais, the world's third largest cement producer, expects second-half 1991 net profits to show a recovery following a setback for the first six months of the year. The group, which is number two in the French cement league after Larfage Coppee, saw first-half net attributable profits fall from FFr402m ($68.1m) to FFrll3m on sales marginally higher at FFr7.97bn, against FFr7.29bn. Profits were hit by weak demand in North America, which accounts for some 16 per cent of total turnover, and a jump in financing costs and special payments following the takeover of Ciments Belges. Ciments Francais said that although it did not expect any quick, short-term pick-up in business, the second half of 1991 should produce sharply higher earnings than did the first half. Prospects of an improvement in the European and world economy in 1992 were cause for optimism, it said. The group said the fall in first-half 1991 operating profit was due mainly to inadequate demand, especially in the US and Canada, where dollar-de- nominated turnover fell by more than 30 per cent. When reporting a 2 per cent decline in first-quarter volume sales in April this year, Ciments Francais said 1991 would be year of transition after five years of growth. For 1990, net profits were FFrl.3bn, on sales of FFrl5.4bn. * Total, the French oil com- pany, is to acquire 50 per cent of two Turkish liquefied natu- ral gas (LNG) companies, kea- ter reports from Paris. The company has signed deals to buy half of Tupgaz, Turkey's fourth biggest natural gas distributor with 5 per cent of the domestic market, and 50 per cent of Astup, a group closely linked to Tupgaz.",

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS In millions of First Half First Half Full Year French Francs 1991 1990 1990 Revenues 69,584 53,125 128,445 Cash Flow 7,614 5,872 11,432 Operating Profit of business segments 5,767 4,170 7,936 Net Profit (Group Share) 3,610 2,571 4,064 Earnings per share in FS 75 56 89 Compared to the first half of 1990, revenues increa- sed 31 %. On a comparable basis, excluding the acquisition of Spontex and the chemical activities of Orkem, the increase was 20'%. Cash flow rose by 30 % and the Group's share of net profit was up 40 %. As in the first half of 1990, extra- ordinary items had only a minor impact. Taking into account the issue of new shares as a result of the merger with OFP-Omnium Financier de Paris, earnings per share increased by 34 % to FS 75. OPERATING PROFIT OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS The operating profit of the business segments, up 38 %, was as follows: In mions of First Half First Half Full Year FrnchFrancs 1991 1990 1990 Exploration and Production 1,418 1,169 3,034 (outside Middle East) Refining and Marketing 3,0864 2,230 3011 Tradingand Middle East 512 414 959 Specialty chemicals 723 334 926 Mining 30 23 6 ,767 4w170 7,9 Al segments of the Group participated in the increa- aed results. Exploraton and production outside the Middle East benefited from the increase in gas producton, prli- culerly in Indonesia, from an average price level of crude during the period greaterthrn that in the first half of 1990, and from the revaluation of gas prices from the North Sea and the Far East. The contribution of downstream operations to ove- rall operating profits had reached 53 % in the first half of 1990, and achieved the same level in the first half of 1991. In addition to the temporary expansion of refining margins during the first two months of the year, this sector has continued to benefit from the structural improvement of refining margins and the operating rates of the refineries in Europe. The mar- keting margins, in comparison, continue to feel the effects of a very competitive marketplace, particu- larly in France. In the United States, refining and marketing remain depressed, due to the ongoing economic recession. The Trading and Middle East segment achieved improved results due to a significant increase in pro- duction of crude in the Emirates, as well as the increase in sales on international markets. The increase in profits in specialty chemicals has been a result not only of the integration of the chemi- cal activities of Orkem and Spontex, but also due to continuous good performance at Hutchinson. The mining sector confirmed its retum to the breake- ven level achieved in 1990. Group gross investments reached FS 8,582 million, compared to FS 14,104 million during the first half of 1990 (of which FS 8,251 million resulted from the acquisition of Orkem's assets). Despite this relatively sustained level of capital expenditures, the company's net debt ratio (net financial debt divided by equity) was brought down to 0.32, compared to 0.36 at the end of 1990. In sum, after the tensions brought on by the crisis in the Gulf on the price of crude during the second half of 1990, and afterwards on refining margins during January and February of 1991, the Group achieved good industrial and commercial performances since the spring of 1991 in its various operating segments. These performances continued throughout the sum- mer. Pmar coamvmf Earnings for TOTAL reached FS 2,273 m llon for the first half, compared to FS 668 miion in the first half of 1990.

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkinm in Paris YVES Saint Laurent, the French fashion and perfumes group, yesterday unveiled a 41.9 per cent fall in net profits for the first half of the year. It blamed the decline on the effects of the Gulf war. The decline In air travel and airport duty free sales during the hostilities led to a 4.3 per cent fall in sales, from FFr1.36bn ($20m) in the first six months of last year to FFrl.3bn in the same period of 1991. Net earnings collapsed to FFr41m, against FFr70.6m in the same period last year. However, the decline was intensified by a drop in excep- tional earnings from exchange rate gains, from FFr24.3m in the first half of last year to just FFr3.9m in the same period this year. Yves Saint Laurent makes 60 per cent of its perfumes sales in the second half, and believes that demand is strong enough to keep operating prof- its stable for the year. Net annual profits should be down slightly, the group forecast. The six-monthly operating profit fell by 30.3 per cent, from FFrl87m to FFrl3Om, while interest charges were down slightly from FFr90m to FFr88m.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels MR JEAN Duronsoy yesterday announced his surprise resig- nation as chief executive of Gechem, the Belgian chemicals group, which lost BFr256m ($7.17m) after tax in the first half of 1991. Mr Duronsoy, who became chief executive in 1988, gave up his managerial role last Friday, with immediate effect, and announced the decision yester- day after the Belgian stock market had closed. \"It's really very unexpected,\" said a Brussels broker. \"I don't think that the market will be very happy about it.\" Mr Duronsoy, who is 59, said he felt he had achieved a turn- round in the fortunes of the company, which was almost bankrupt three years ago, and that it was therefore the right time to hand over to Mr Luc Vansteenkiste, Gechem's chief operating officer. He added that he had been asked to remain on the board until the end of next April by fellow directors Mr Philippe Liotier, the group chairman, and Mr Gerard Mestrallet, managing director of Socidt6 Gendrale de Belgique, which owns 58 per cent of Gechem. Mr Duronsoy has worked for La G6ndrale, Belgium's largest holding company, since 1973. Gechem, which produces polyurethane foam under the Recticel and Foamex names, struggled against diffcult mar- ket conditions during the first six months of this year. In the equivalent period last year, the group made BFr600m after tax, but that figure did not include results from Foa- mex LP, a new company which was formed in October out of the loss-making US foam operations of Recticel and the foam activities of the US group, 21 International. Foamex had a very poor first half, battered by the downturn in the US car, furniture and construction industries, and turned in profits of just $5m. Gechem had budgeted for prof- its of $20m, and said yesterday that the result did not cover headquarters expenses, good- will amortisation and interest charges on loans raised to acquire the business. Gechem paid about $200m for its 51 per cent stake in Foamex and has an option to increase or reduce its investment before Septem- ber 1992. \"[The result] isn't what we expected and in that sense - just based on nine months - you can say we paid too high a price,\" admitted Mr Liotier yes- terday, but he refused to be Mr Jean Duronsoy: felt it was the right time to hand over drawn on whether Gechem would attempt to cut or increase its holding. Gechem's Recticel operations in Europe held up slightly bet- ter, turning in net income of BFr349m, against BFr354m in the first half of 1990. The BFr256m loss excluded some BFrSllm of currency translation charges, relating to the group's sale of Sadacem, its metals processing business. The exchange adjustments, built up over five years, and already written off in past accounts, had to be taken through the profit and loss fig- ures to comply with US accounting regulations.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva SASEA, the investment banking company headed by Mr Florio Fiorini, has won a year's grace from its creditors. The company acted as a junior partner to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, in his $1.3bn takeover of MGM-Pathe, the large US entertainment group. It is also working closely with Crddit Lyonnais, the French banking group which, after providing most of the finance for the takeover, is now engaged in a legal battle with Mr Parretti. Creditors have agreed not to ask for early repayment of a SFr340m ($220m) convertible bond, as they were entitled to after Sasea had failed to fulfil commitments given in the issuing prospectus. It specified in the prospectus that it would maintain a minimum level of equity. Sasea was given until August 31 next year to sell off more assets and rebuild its capital base. Earlier this month Sasea Holding, the parent company, disclosed provisional figures for the year ending June 30, showing a net loss of SFr221.8m compared with the profit of SFr26m it posted in 1989-90. The profit and loss account included loss provisions of SFr17Om, taking overall provisions on the balance sheet to SFr220m. Total assets of SFr1.77bn included fixed assets of SFr633m, of which SFr345m represented holdings or subordinated loans to associated companies. Short-term liabilities amounted to SFr818m, with long-term borrowing at SFr466m. The 1990-1991 net loss of SFr222m reduced equity to SFr260m, well below the nominal capital of SFr402m. Last week, it was announced that Mr Giovanni Gianola would replace Mr Eric Baudat as chairman of the holding company, a move which was interpreted in Geneva banking circles as confirming the growing influence of Credit Lyonnais. Five other directors resigned. Mr Fiorini remains managing director. Sasea said that the creditors' decision to waive their right to repayment of the convertible loan showed they were happy with the management's plans to realise the value of its assets over the next few months.",

   "text_content" : "In German road great tests, minds It is simply not 'Audi' to boast or crow. We prefer others to sing our praises. However, not to pass on the German reviews of the new Audi 100 would be hiding our light under a rather large bushel. The concept of'active safety' (the ability to avoid an accident) is fundamental to the thinking behind the new Audi 100. Hence ABS braking, front-wheel drive (to pull .ANTIoc*BRAKES you out of trouble rather than push you into it) or the option of quattro four-wheel drive. QuATmo.4o Acceleration and handling are obviously an important part of this philosophy so it was pleasing to hear the respected magazine 'Auto Motor und Sport' say that 'the Audi actually lets itself be driven nimbly and precisely like a small car. At the same time, it demonstrates excellent road holding and therefore ensures completely relaxed and unequalled driving'. And because accidents will happen, at Audi we haven't ignored 'passive safety' either. The new, strengthened side panels and the Procon-Ten safety PROCONTEN system were described by'Autozeitung' as giving the Audi 100 2.3E, 'the advantage in safety terms' over the BMW 520i and the Mercedes 230E. But it doesn't say in any manual (and certainly not in the Audi handbook) that a safe car has to be a boring car. 'Auto Motor und Sport' described driving the 2.8E between 2,000 and 4,000 revs as a 'genuine pleasure' compared to the BMW 525i and the Mercedes 260E.

The Test Director of'Autobild' summed up by saying that .can.a the new Audi 100 was, in his opinion, 'a real alternative to the BMW and Mercedes'. While 'Autozeitung' simply stated that the Audi 100 2.3E 'in comparability tests takes first place' over the BMW 520i and the Mercedes 230E.

   "text_content" : "Gita Piramal charts the rapid rise of the acquisitive Indian group HHABRIA group, India's seventh largest business organisation, is busy re-organising its empire after several years of unbridled growth. From 1985 to 1990, Mr Mano- har R. Chhabria, a Dubai-based consumer electronics tycoon, acquired seven important Indian companies and a host of subsidiaries in a hectic take- over spree. In the process, he carved out a RslSbn ($583m) empire from next to nothing, acquired an army of enemies, and provoked a swarm of government inves- tigations into his dealings. Today, most of the cases against the group have been withdrawn'along with banking restrictions which had been imposed during the investiga- tions. But in at least one of the group's companies, results have been affected. Dunlop India (DI), the tyre manufacturer, has announced a big drop in earnings. For the year ending March 1990, the Calcutta-based company's oper- ating profits were Rs410m from sales of Rs5.81bn. This year, they are expected to be slightly lower from sales of Rs6.lObn. Despite the rise in sales, the company is losing market share. Explaining DI's poor perfor- mance, Mr Chhabria says: \"We became the victim of a credit squeeze which prevented us from expanding production facilities. There have been no defaults.\" A strike at the Ambuttur plant, the smaller of Dunlop India's two plants, has not improved matters. Labour may turn out to be the key to DI's revival. A voluntary retire- ment scheme is being intro- duced for the heavily overstaf- fed 65-year-old company whose payroll is almost Rs320m more than those of other tyre compa- nies. \"If I can save this Rs320m, I will make windfall profits for the company. But, given the labour laws at the moment, I am finding it difficult to achieve this goal,\" says Mr Chhabria. Profits, however, do not appear to be a problem at Shaw Wallace (SW), Mr Chha- bria's second flagship com- pany. A liquor and consumer products company, SW recently delivered -excellent results for the year ended March 1991. Pre-tax profits were Rs21Om on sales of Rs4.02bn and the company has announced a dividend of 42.5 per cent as well as a one-for-one bonus share issue. According to Mr Chhabria, SW's heady results this year were due to two main strate- gies. The first was to classify SW as a liquor company. \"In a country which espouses prohi- bition, we used to shy away and call ourselves a trading house. But liquor - not deter- gents and soaps - was the money-spinner and we had to accept this.\" The second strategy was to expand production of its brands. Prevented from adding to existing capacity by strin- gent government regulations, SW got round the obstacle by negotiating marketing links with several smaller firms across the country. Meanwhile two new brands - a whisky and a rum - turned to be a marketing director's delight. SW's latest results are even more delightful to a man who has been fighting hard to establish his managerial repu- tation among India's elitist industrial castes. In a classic rags-to-riches story, Mr Chhabria, 45, left Bombay to become a Sony dealer in the Middle East almost 25 years ago. In 1985, he returned with dollars which he used to snap up blue-chip Indian companies. But the acrimonious battle which Mr Chhabria fought to acquire SW, along with his abrasive style, soon had observers cautioning that a quick-buck trader could never Manohar R. Chhabria: empire built from next to nothing acquire an industrialist's long-term vision. He set out to prove them wrong, with mixed success, as the radically differ- ent results of DI and SW show. Today, Mr Chhabria is a changed man. The mellowed group chairman now prefers to attribute SW's achievements to \"collective management efforts\" rather than him- self. G~ one is the bluster with * which massive capital Sinvestments, were announced to the media. A Rs20bn investment programme which would have led the already highly diversified group into oil drilling, hospi- tals and chemicals, has been more or less whittled down to a new Rs3.2bn third factory for Di. Instead of fast-paced growth and takeovers, the talk now centres around the need for synergy within the group. \"If there is a tyre company avail- able, I would love to buy it. Otherwise takeovers no longer interest me,\" Mr Chhabria adds. But old habits die hard, and it is unlikely that the group will remain far from contro- versy for ever. Currently, it is involved in a raucous bid to retain control of Calcutta chemicals, a toiletries maker and an SW subsidiary. At another level, a wide- ranging management restruct- uring is being planned which will create a six-member com- mittee to direct the group's growth. Moreover, the group's activi- ties are being ruthlessly streamlined. Unprofitable com- panies are on the auctioneer's block even if they have been acquired after prolonged and painful litigation. Genelec, an electrical lighting manufac- turer with accumulated losses of Rs300m, is one example. The Chhabria group has clearly come of age.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawith in Johannesburg PICK 'N PAY, South Africa's largest supermarket chain, recorded lower earnings in the six months to the end of August because of the reces- sion and labour costs. Although turnover rose by 15.6 per cent to R2.81bn ($741m), trading income was 10.3 per cent lower at R53.1m. Attributable earnings were 3.2 per cent lower at R31.7m. Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman, said a \"catastrophic recession\" had hurt cash sales. Although the recession has hit capital goods producers hard- est, recent months have seen its impact spread to the retail sector. Mr Ackerman said the group had suffered from being unable to reduce expenses such as labour costs - about 60 per cent of the total - in line with lower than expected sales. He said this was because the union concerned refused to accept the principle of flexible working practices which would allow the group to relocate workers from unproductive stores. Mr Ackerman said 1,000 to 2,000 workers faced re- trenchment unless progress was made. Profits were also affected by the large capital expenditure on the introduction of scan- ning equipment which the group wanted to have in place before the introduction of value added tax next month. Mr Ackerman said he was confident that sales would pick up in the second half and allow the group to continue its unbroken run of increased profits every year since it opened 23 years ago. Earnings per share dropped by 3.2 per cent to 40.4 cents, but the dividend was main- tained at 12.5 cents. * W&A Investment Corpora- tion, the diversified South Afri- can industrial conglomerate, blamed the recession and high interest charges for a drop in earnings in the six months to the end of June. Turnover at W&A, which concentrates on basic indus- tries including tyres, scaffold- ing and footwear, rose by 34.8 per cent to R1.67bn. However, with tight operating conditions squeezing margins, operating profits rose by 24.8 per cent to R171.9m. The group's interest bill increased by 64.3 per cent, to R88m, following acquisitions t at AAF, an overseas arm, and an increase in working capital. I Following a restructuring a year ago, when all the operat- ing assets in FS, the parent group, were put under W&A, the average number of equity instruments in issue rose by 118 per cent compared with a i year ago. This offset a 106 per i cent rise in attributable earn- i ings, to R57m, with the effect that earnings per share were 5.2 per cent down at 34.8 cents. The dividend was maintained at 15.5 cents per share. I Highlights of the past six months' trading include the sale of the JD furniture group's debtor's book to a consumer > finance company and the acquisitions by AAF of Alloy Wheels International and Unit- span Modular building.",

PolyGram would not disclose the financial terms of the agreement, but said the deal would increase its share of the US music distribution market from 12 to 15 per cent. It has undertaken, as part of the agreement, to increase its commitment to the develop- ment of black music. PolyGram has agreed to appoint a senior executive to promote black musical talent and will set up an advisory committee with representa- tives from each of its labels to provide guidance in the mar- keting of black music. Poly- Gram's labels include A&M, Island, London, Polydor and PolyGram Classics and Jazz. Motown, whose artists include Stevie Wonder, is owned by Mr Jheryl Busby, its chief executive, the singer Diana Ross, affiliates of Boston Ventures Management, and MCA Record Ventures. Mr Busby said he regarded PolyGram's pledge to assist Motown in the recruitment and development of black manag- ers and artists as an important part of the agreement. Mr Alain Levy, PolyGram's chief executive, said: \"Through its creativity, talents and cul- ture, the black community must be an ever-increasing part of PolyGram's culture.

   "text_content" : "By Nlkki Tall in New York JACK Eckerd, a privately- owned drug store company based in Florida, yesterday filed a plan with the Ohio bankruptcy courts to acquire Revco, the US drug store group which in 1968 became the first large leveraged buy-out to fail. The proposal is the third reor- ganisation plan put forward for Revco. Revco and its parent com- pany, Anac Holdings, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protec- tion three years ago, and this summer the company filed its own proposed reorganisation plan with the Akron bank- ruptcy court. Revco said only that it had received the Eckerd plan and was reviewing it, although in the past the company has been unenthusiastic about Eckerd's attentions. Revco did note, however, that aside from its own plan, a reorganisation scheme backed by four of its creditor and equity groups had also been filed this month. The Eckerd plan has the backing of only one of the class of creditors - namely, the 12.125 per cent noteholders - although Eckerd claimed that its proposal was also \"the result of a series of discussions with various creditor groups\". The Florida-based retailer maintained that its own plan i provided \"significantly i improved values over previous Eckerd offers to acquire Revco\" and \"superior value for Revco's creditors\". Under the scheme, Eckerd and Revco would be merged into one organisation, and the company would be brought back to the stock market via an initial public offering. Creditors of Revco - rang- ing from bank lenders and I trade creditors to holders of I subordinated notes - would i trade their claims for notes or debentures in either a reorgan- Sised Revco or the new holding 3 company. Some of the holding i company debentures would be convertible into shares in the t merged group. Â· Money raised in the public P offering would help to reduce debts and finance restructur- r ing operations. I Eckerd itself was taken pri- r vate via a leveraged buy-out in 1 1986. It acquired 220 stores * from Revco last year, although r it later announced plans to resell or liquidate about half of I the outlets. I As result, Eckerd now oper- i ates 1,676 Eckerd drug stores in t 13 states, together with various i optical stores and 318 Express Photo Labs.

Sales during the period - the second quarter of A&P's financial year - were virtually static at $2.65bn, against $2.6bn, but' operating profits plunged from $77.9m to $42.9m. Interest charges were slightly higher at $17.4m, compared with $16.5m, and earnings per share slid from 95 cents to 38 cents. The company, however, had already warned of a 60 per cent fall in second-quarter earnings and the shares, which were badly hit then, slipped only $% to $35 yesterday. A&P, which is 53 per cent- owned by Germany's Tengel- mann group and takes in the Waldbaum's and Food Empo- rium in New York, Farmer Jack in Detroit and Kohl's in Wisconsin, confined itself to a brief one-sentence comment on the figures. It noted that it con- tinued \"to pursue a course of maintaining our market share in an increasingly competitive and costly environment, in order to be prepared for the economic upturn\". Part of A&P's problems stem from recent acquisitions - in both Canada and Detroit - and it has also been hit by a mixture of recession and stiff competition in its main north-east and Midwest mar- kets. The company still owns a 7.2 per cent stake in Isosceles, the UK food retailer beset by man- agement upheavals, which it carries at cost ($164m) in its balance sheet. A&P has argued for a larger management role at Isosceles but, given its own current problems, seems unlikely to become heavily involved at present.",

At unrevealed cost, the soft drinks company - part of PepsiCo, the giant US consumer prod- ucts group - plans to change its corporate logo on every- thing from cans of Pepsi to company stationery. Instead of the circle within a rectangle, with Pepsi's name between two waving lines, the new logo (right) consists of Pepsi's name in \"italic capital typeface\" across the length of the symbol The bottom half of the logo comprises a block of colour with a circular symbol (minus the Pepsi name) inserted on the right-hand side. The red, white and blue colour scheme has been maintained. According to Pepsi, the new logo has taken four years to design and tepresents a \"sleeker, more streamlined look\". \"Consumer research,\" the company enthuses, \"shows that the new logo design looks more youthful, more refreshing and that it has about twice the shelf impact compared to the competition\". While Pepsi refuses to reveal the redesign costs, it maintains that a previous Cool Cans sum- mer packaging initiative helped lift sales by 21 per cent. Pepsi has used seven previ- ous logos, starting in 1898 with an ornate version of the Pepsi- Cola name - which looked a little like wrought ironwork - and including the two \"bottle- top\" designs in 1950 and 1962. The current logo was intro- duced in 1987. The newest design should be found on most products by the end of 1992.",

   "text_content" : "A L S T HOM At a meeting chaired by Pierre SUARD on September 18,1991, the Board of Directors of Alcatel Alsthom reviewed audited consolidated sales and earnings for the first six months of 1991. 199 9 rrthffe rig FS 15)bilh6n Group net sales amounted to FS 74,770 million, a 9% increase over the first six months of 1990; on a comparable structural basis, the increase in sales would have been 6%. Income from operations after financing rose 26% to FS 6,550 million, reflecting continuing margin improvements at the Group's major operating units, particularly Alcatel. Net income before minority interests amounted to FS 3,466 million. After minority interests, net income totalled FS 2,599 million. These amounts, representing increases of 24% and 32%, respectively, over the first half of 1990, include a non-recurring income of FS 630 million arising from the sale of Alcatel Alsthom shares to the Fiat Group as part of the Group's acquisition of Telettra and the establishment of cross-shareholdings between Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat Primary earnings per share, based on a total of 113 million shares outstanding at June 30,1991, amounted to FS 23.00, as compared to FS 20.20 one year earlier, based on 97.9 million shares outstanding at the time. Excluding non-recurring items, net earnings per share amounted to FS 17.40, as compared to FS 15.30 one year earlier. Based on market trends at midyear, sales growth for 1991 as a whole should be in line with the increase recorded in the first half Barring unforeseen circumstances, growth in income before non-recurring items and minority interests for the year should be more moderate than in the first half but should substantially exceed sales growth, while non-recurring income is not expected to increase significantly. The Board of Directors notes with satisfaction the response of shareholders to the optional dividend in share form. Some 67% of the 1990 dividend was paid in shares, resulting in the issue of 1.7 million new shares and representing a reinvestment of FS 912 million. Payment of the 1990 dividend in share form, bond conversions, and exercise of stock options issued to certain members of management cumulatively resulted in the issuance of 2,044,201 Alcatel Alsthom shares, representing an increase in share capital of FS 82 million and additional paid-in capital of FS 955 million. Net Sales (in FS billion) Full year 90 144.1 74.8 68.5 +9% 90 91 First Half Thus, as a result of these operations, Alcatel Alsthom's share capital at August 31, 1991 had risen to FS 4,813 million from FS 4,731 million following the mergers with Gendrale Occidentale, Trocaddro Participations, Saft and Locatel. The share capital at that date consisted of 120.3 million shares outstanding, eligible for dividends from January 1, 1991. In addition, and as authorized by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 26, 1990, the Board of Directors has approved stock options permitting certain members of management to purchase Alcatel Alsthom shares, and also approved a new capital increase open to employees. The stock options will be exercisable between September 18, 1993 and September 18, 1996 at a price of FS 530 per share, and will lead to the creation of up to 1,500,000 shares. The capital increase open to emplbyees-irwiwe \" 7i before Decembre 31, 1992, and would lead to the ,i creation of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 shares, ati a subscription price of FS 470 per share.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb in London and Patrick Harverson in New York ITALIAN government bonds jumped over half a percentage point yesterday on news that investors in Italian debt have had their withholding tax pay- ments reimbursed. Bank of Italy officials said the Finance Ministry had refunded part or all of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on investments in Italian bonds to foreign banks, including Salo- mon Brothers and Morgan Stanley. The news prompted strong buying among mainly Euro- pean investors, although bond prices later slipped back a little on profit-taking. The benchmark 10-year bond - the 12 per cent bond due June 2001 - traded at 97.51 to yield 12.81 per cent by late afternoon, compared with Fri- day's close of 96.92 yielding 12.94 per cent. The Finance Ministry had promised in April it would speed up the process of reim- bursing withholding tax to non-resident investors. *ELSEWHERE in Europe, German government bonds drifted lower following further warnings from the Bundes- bank about inflation, and in the absence of a strong lead from the US Treasury bond market. In its monthly report for Sep- tember, released yesterday, the Bundesbank repeated earlier warnings to the government and labour unions about the need to contain inflation and curb public sector spending, while stressing commitment to a tight monetary policy. The Liffe bund futures con- tract opened at 85.23, trading in a narrow range of 85.13-85.24 and reaching 85;18 by late afternoon. Dealers reported some switching out of German bunds into Dutch government bonds yesterday and at the end of last week as the 10-year yield spread has reached 35 basis points. GOVERNMENT BONDS Dutch bonds closed unchanged or slightly weaker in dull trade. The market is expecting a new government bond issue to be announced shortly, with traders speculating that the new issue would have a 10-year maturity and a coupon of .about 8% per cent. *UK government bonds opened lower following news that the ruling Conservative party had fallen behind the opposition Labour party in the opinion polls. The poll, which appeared in The Sunday Times, showed the government 4 points behind Labour, dashing hopes that it might call a general election this autumn. The Conservative party had edged ahead of Labour in a series of recent opinion polls this month, leading to specula- tion that it would call an elec- tion in November. Gilt prices ended lower on the day, with the largest falls I occurring in the 10 to 15 year maturity band. The benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 115% and traded at 114H to yield 9.95 per cent by : late afternoon. Traders said there was some switching out of long-dated gilts into short-dated issues on Friday and, to a lesser extent, yesterday. The market ignored yester- day's trade balance and cur- rent account data as traders said the focus is mainly on Wednesday's auction of Â£1.5bn of 9%' per cent conversion stock due 2004. * US bond prices traded slightly firmer in narrow ranges as participants pre- pared for this week's large injection of supply and some fresh economic data. In late trading, the bench- mark 30-year government bond was up A at 102J, yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was also a touch higher, up A at 1006, yielding 6.129 per cent. The bulk of the day's activ- ity was limited to dealers and investors adjusting their posi- tions ahead of approaching Treasury auctions. Of the gov- ernment securities to be sold this week, $21.2bn of bills were auctioned during the after- noon, a record $l13bn in two- year notes will be sold today, and $9.25bn in five-year notes will come under the hammer tomorrow. In spite of the large amount of new government paper due for auction, analysts believe the market will retain its firm tone. * THE YEN'S strengthening against the dollar helped to lift Japanese government bond prices in London trading yes- terday. Traders expect to see a fur- ther rally in over the next few days on hopes of lower interest rates. The market was closed in Japan for a public holiday and trading volumes were very light in London. The yield on the benchmark No 129 government bond moved to 6.015 per cent, from its close of 6.045 per cent on Friday in Tokyo. The recent rally has been fuelled by the fall in short-term interest rates, speculation that the Bank of Japan will cut the Official Discount Rate (cur- rently at 5.5 per cent), and the yen's strength against the dol- lar to give an exchange rate of Y133.25 to $1. Traders expect the yield on the No 129 bond to break 6 per cent soon. Traders are expecting an auction of about Y1,000bn of 10-year JGBs with a coupon of 5.9 per cent this week.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London TELEBRAS, the Brazilian public sector telecommunica. tions company, yesterday became the latest Latin Ameri- can company to raise finance in the international bond mar- ket. The company launched a $200m five-year bond issue, lead-managed by Merrill Lynch. The bonds carry a cou- pon of 10 per cent, payable semi-annually, and will be INTERNATIONAL BONDS priced tomorrow to yield around 11.5 per cent. The deal has an amortisation structure and will begin to repay after two years, hence the issue has an average life of 3.5 years. The lead manager said the structure lessened the risk of the borrower being unable to refinance the issue at the maturity date. Telebras has been among the most popular stocks on the Brazilian stock market this year, its share price rising by 400 per cent in the five months to the end of August in dollar terms. The company now has a market capitalisation of $1.7bn. To stay popular, the com- pany's stock may have to over- come increasing doubts about the economic and political sta- bility of Brazil. Inflation no longer looks under control and the govern- ment's privatisation pro- gramme is in jeopardy follow- ing a high court decision at the weekend to block the sale of Usiminas, a state-owned steel company. There are no plans to privat- ise Telebras, however. The cov- enants of the deal make it a condition of default for the government to surrender a controlling stake in the com- pany. The Telebras deal is the fourth international bond issue by a Brazilian company since Petrobras, the state-sector oil company, launched its $250m deal in July, lead-managed by Chase Investment Bank. Last month, Petrobras returned with a $200m five-year deal lead managed by J.P. Morgan Securities. These bonds have an inves- tor put option after three years and now trade on a yield of about 12.15 per cent. Last week, CVRD, the min- ing group, launched a debut $200m three-year bond issue through Citicorp Investment Bank. Yesterday, this deal was trading at a yield of 11.2 per cent. Hence Telebras has been priced mid-way between Petro- bras and CVRD. Elsewhere, activity was sub- dued although syndicate man- agers are expecting several substantial deals this week. Belgium is expected to launch a 10-year Eurodollar transac- tion, probably of about $400m to $500m. Large new issues in Euro-yen and Ecu are also expected. Spain is likely to come with a large Ecu bond issue, proba- bly of about Eculbn. The deal would be launched on the domestic market but could attract considerable buy- ing from international inves- tors. Yesterday in the Ecu sector, activity was again restricted to the shorter maturities. Corn- pagnie Bancaire launched a EculOOm two-year issue lead- managed by Merrill Lynch. The bonds pay a coupon of 9% per cent and were re-of- fered to investors at a fixed price of 99.87 where the yield is 9.45 per cent. The issue follows short-dated deals by Rabobank, LKB Baden-Wtlrttemberg and Bayerische Hypotheken Bank last week. This last deal was also of two-years maturity and came at a yield of 9.25 per cent. Crddit Local, the French state financial institution which provides finance to local authorities, came with a FFrl.2bn fungible issue, adding to its. outstanding FFrlbn eight-year issue. The bonds pay a coupon of 9% per cent and were re-of- fered to investors at a fixed price of par.",

   "text_content" : "SAUDI ARAMCO, the Saudi Arabian oil group, has appointed J.P. Morgan, the US bank, to arrange a $1.5bn loan, the first international borrow- ing by the state-owned oil giant, AP-DJ reports. Saudi Aramco is finalising the terms and conditions of the loan with Morgan before approaching the international markets to syndicate the deal, banking sources said. They said the money was being raised for general pur- poses rather than any specific Saudi Aramco project. In Lon- don, Morgan declined to com- ment on the transaction. Earlier this year, Morgan arranged a highly-secretive $4.5bn loan for the Saudi gov- ernment, the kingdom's first international borrowing in more than 20 years. The money was needed urgently to meet the huge financial commitments made during the recent Gulf war, including a $16.8bn pledge to the US government to help cover the costs of the cam- paign to free Kuwait. Interest charges on the ear- lier Morgan deal were set at % per cent above the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Saudi Arabia still needs to raise additional sums to plug its budget deficit and pay for ambitious investment projects in the oil and industrial sec- tors. US officials said last week that the kingdom had still to pay $3bn of the money pledged to the US Treasury. Borrowing is a highly sensi- tive subject in Saudi Arabia because of Islamic strictures against usury, and western dip- lomats in Riyadh said the gov- ernment was keen to avoid the publicity that would be associ- ated with another interna- tional borrowing. Instead, the kingdom is expected to raise its financing needs by borrowings arranged by parastatal companies such as Saudi Aramco, the diplo- mats said. The state company has huge investments planned over the coming decade, including a multi-billion dollar project to raise sustainable oil output to 10m barrels a day. Banking sources said it was not clear whether the Saudi Aramco loan could be used to finance general government spending needs or whether the money would be applied specif- ically to the state company's development plans. The pace of borrowing by Saudi parastatal companies has picked up this year, but so far the borrowings have been restricted to Saudi domestic banks. The Saudi steel manu- facturer Hadeed, the electricity utility Sceco West and several Saudi petrochemical compa- nies have signed or are negoti- ating dollar borrowings from the local banking sector.",

Representatives of the IDT will make presentations to institutional investors next month, after which the Euro- dollar deal, of at least $100m, will be launched. Although the IDT is inde- pendent of the South African government and has borrowed domestically without govern- ment backing, the issue will carry a government guarantee."

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan in Milan ITALY'S IRI state holding company yesterday confirmed plans to float \"a relevant quota\" of the savings shares in Credito Italiano, one of the country's biggest banks, via an international consortium led by Goldman Sachs. Precise timing for the flotation, which has been widely expected, was not revealed. However, IRI said it would take place before the end of November. IRI owns 56.9 per cent of Cre- dito Italiano's non-convertible savings shares and 67.1 per cent of the bank's ordinary stock. An IRI official underlined there was no question of ordi- nary shares being sold at this point, nor of the state reducing its hold over the bank. Analysts' views on how many of its 165m Credito Itali- ano savings shares IRI would sell varied between 20m and 50m. That would put a maximum value of almost LlOObn on the deal, based on yesterday's Milan closing price of L1,905 for Credito Italiano savings shares. IRI's finances have deterio- rated sharply this year follow- ing lower earnings and cash calls at many of its subsid- iaries. In June, IRI raised $275m through an interna- tional placement of shares in the STET telecommunications group to improve its financial position. Analysts expect the reduc- tion of IRI's stake in Credito Italiano to be followed by a rights issue by the bank. A similar move at Banca Com- merciale Italiana, which is also IRI-owned, is also widely fore- cast. Credito Italiano made net profits of L284bn ($225m) last year, up from L270bn in 1989. It paid a dividend of L85 for each ordinary share and L100 for savings shares. The latest deal will offer an indirect shot in the arm for the International Stock Exchange's Seaq International system in London, on which the new Cre- dito Italiano savings shares will be traded. At present, Seaq only trades the bank's ordinary shares. Volumes on Seaq, which now lists over 20 Italian blue chips, have been relatively buoyant recently, leading many Italian stockbrokers to regard the sys- tem as an increasing threat at a time of shrinking turnover on the domestic market.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris CREDIT LYONNAIS, the aggressive French state-owned bank, yesterday saw the rating on $6.9bn of its long-term debt downgraded by Moody's Inves- tor Services, the New York credit rating agency. Moody's has revised its rat- ing on the bank's long-term credit and long-term deposits from Aal to Aa2. This moves it from the same rating as Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, down a notch to the same division as Paribas, the banking and investment group, said Mr Samuel Theodore, assistant vice-president at Moody's. While the downgrading is slight, it is an objective recog- nition of the change in the bank's long-term credit outlook brought by its recent fast expansion, which has aroused concern in French political and banking circles. \"The change in rating is based on the increased risk profile of Credit Lyonnais' activities and assets, at a time when the French domestic market is seeing a basic change in bank refinancing towards more costly and poten- tially more volatile resources,\" said Moody's, which has had Credit Lyonnais's long-term debts and deposits under review since July. Crddit Lyonnais' increased risk profile stemmed from its marked expansion into areas more uncertain than its tradi- tional banking activities, though Moody's continued to recognise the bank's \"very strong commercial position\" in France. The bank is currently entan- gled in a court case against Italian financier Mr Giancarlo Parretti, to whom its Dutch unit has an exposure of almost $900m and is by far the largest creditor of VEV, the struggling French textiles group."

   "text_content" : "By Terry Hall in Wellington DFC New Zealand, the failed former state bank, is accelerat- ing debt repayments to its creditors, mainly in Japan, the US and UK due to a faster- than-expected realisation of assets, primarily in property. The bank, which collapsed in 1989, has to date paid NZ$1.9bn (US$l.lbn) of the NZ$Z2.2bn owed to tier one debtors. These were to be paid over a seven- year period under the terms of the October 1989 agreement which removed the threat of court actions against the DFC. In April, the statutory man- ager, Mr Sandy Maier, paid off NZ$600m, and yesterday he announced the payment of a further NZ$200m on October 15. This will include three future instalments under the original repayments schedule. Mr Maier said more cash would be forthcoming if future property sales were successful, and this would facilitate the payment of interest to tier one creditors, who to date have only received capital. It could also bring forward the date to repay tier two debtholders, who are due to be paid in 1997, and tier three, in 2005. Mr Maier said DFC planned to proceed vigorously with cer- tain legal claims to ensure a better return for creditors.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels AFTER A year in which discussion of EC farm reform has generated more heat than light, agriculture ministers of the 12 yesterday queried the detail rather than the principle of reforming the common agri- cultural licy along the lines proposed by the European Commission. Several member states, including the UK and France, put down markers where they intend to try to bend the com- mission's proposals towards their own national interest. The indications are that CAP reform will eventually proceed along commission lines, but that getting it through the council of farm ministers will make turning round a super- tanker seem fast. The commission plan, finali- sed by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner in July, aims to cut support prices very heavily and elimi- nate growing stockpiles by penalising overproduction. All farmers would be compensated for the price cuts - with amounts varying according to past average yield rather than future tonnage - and all but the larger farmers would be compensated for taking land out of production. At the core of the plan is a proposed 35 per cent cut in the cereals support price. France, the most fundamen talist opponent of the radical Commission plan, wants smaller cuts over a longer period than the 1993-96 period Brussels wants to phase in reform. As the EC's biggest agri-exporter - earning a sur- plus on its farm trade of nearly $lObn last year - France is determined to protect its cere- als exports. It is also intent on demanding protection against mainly US cereals substitutes coming into the EC as a quid pro quo within the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, now stalled on the issue of farm subsidies. \"The [French) government cannot treat as an abstraction the effect of the Commission's proposals on our trade bal- ance,\" said a senior French diplomat, although he acknowledged that this loss could be \"partly or greatly\" off- set by direct transfers to French farmers as compensa- tion. Ireland, which has tended to ally with France on CAP reform, also appealed for a more gradual approach, partly by adducing the immediate need to siphon off large amounts of the EC's stockpiled surpluses to the former Soviet Union for famine relief. Senior Brussels offcials fear that the huge scale of Soviet food needs could relieve the sense of urgency they feel they have established because of the EC's huge and growing surpluses. Several ministers in the EC's ostensibly liberal camp, includ- ing the UK and Denmark, objected to income support Louis Mermas, the French minister, wants smaller cuts over a longer period becoming permanent, and que- ried the commission's figures on the initially higher cost of the reform. The UK remains strongly opposed to the way in which the reform discriminates against generally larger British farms. The Commission argues that the reform will cost some Ecu4.8bn (Â£3.35bn) more in the phase-in period, but will then cost less than the existing sys- tem, and substantially less than any extrapolation from the production trends of the past decade.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent MR ROB Barbour says candidly that his present mis- sion is to frighten off bankers and investment institutions who might be tempted to put up money for new aluminium smelters. As managing director of Alu- saf, South Africa's only pri- mary aluminium producer, he hopes to convince potential investors that his company will go ahead with a R4.5bn (Â£830m) -expansion programme that includes the biggest single smelter ever built. This will leave little room for rival projects until well into the 1990s, he suggests. While Mr Barbour refuses to name names, analysts say he particu- larly wants to deter investors in proposed smelters in Nigeria and Venezuela. Alusaf originally intended to add 420,000 tonnes to its pres- ent annual capacity of 172,000 tonnes. However, Mr Barbour has been in Europe to sign an agreement for Pechiney, the state-owned French aluminium and packaging group, to pro- vide all the basic engineering and technology for the scheme and the technology chosen will provide an extra 466,000 tonnes of capacity. At present about 60 per cent of western world primary alu- minium capacity is operating at a loss because prices in real terms are at their lowest ever. But Mr Barbour is convinced that Alusafs shareholders, which include Gencor, the South African mining and Aluminlum Primary production (million tonnes) 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 Mjcorpr nWg s oCwunnmg IrOte of westernm world producion Source: PawIek (August t19) industrial group, and Alu- suisse, the Swiss aluminium company, will approve the expansion programme when a feasibility study is presented to them next March. The project sprang from Alu- sass ability to win a favoura- ble 25-year electricity contract from Eskom, the South African power utility, which will be linked to the price of alumin- ium. This is not new in the industry but what is probably unique is that the contract con- tains no floor or ceiling prices. Eskom might also take a 20 per cent shareholding in the ven- ture. Mr Barbour suggests that, because the energy to make aluminium accounts for such a high percentage of the total cost - about 30 per cent - aluminium is \"frozen energy\". So Alusaf \"will become an exporter of South African energy with high value-added\". He admits that, even with the Eskom contract, Alusaf would not be able to produce aluminium at the low cost achieved by smelters in Vene- zuela and Canada using hydro- electric power. Alusaf will also have to import all of the alu- mina (aluminium oxide) it requires' - this raw material accounts for about 25 per cent of the total cost - but it will still be among the world's low- est-cost producers \"and we would be able to survive at the bottom of the economic cycles\". The project also will not make economic sense unless it qualifies for the South African government's new export incentive scheme which per- mits accelerated tax write-offs for capital expenditure and other benefits. Nevertheless, there is a \"high probability\" that the smelter scheme will be approved by the middle of 1992, says Mr Barbour, and the smelter will take about another three years to bring into production. \"In the mean- time we hope to deter others from thinking about alumin- ium smelter projects. We want to frighten them off by con- vincing them that this one is unstoppable.\"",

Cocoa prices were in similar retreat in both markets. New York traders said a Landell Mills forecast for a 47,000-tonne production deficit next year was well below expectations.

   "text_content" : "Alec Gordon suggests radical changes to the moribund agreement HIS WEEK representa- tives of the world's cos- fee-producing countries and most of the coffee consum- ing countries are meeting at the International Coffee Organ- isation's London headqarters in an attempt to put together a new international coffee agree- ment. The chances of their suc- ceeding are small, and this is a pity. Coffee is the second most important commodity in inter- national trade, after oil, and for many oil-importing, devel- oping countries it is by far the most important single export. When prices collapsed after the suspension of the organisa- tion's export quota system in mid-1989 coffee exporting coun- tries lost an estimated $4bn in export revenue while consum- ers noticed hardly any change in prices. Even market economists accept that open, unregulated markets are an imperfect way of rewarding the human effort that goes into the production of commodities. Any arrange- ment that can make commod- ity production less of a gamble and introduce some stability to the market is of huge potential value in human as wel as eco- nomic terms. Until quite recently interna- tional commodity agreements, a polite term for international- ly-supported cartels, were thought to be the answer. By restricting supplies to the mar- ket through the operation of export quotas or other mea- sures the agreements suc- ceeded in supporting the prices of a number of commodities above their equilibrium, or market-clearing, levels for months or even years at a time. It was recognised that this could not be done indefinitely, that cartels carried the seeds of their own destruction; but it was hoped that the additional income would be invested in economic development, in alternative and more remuner- ative activities, before the car- tels collapsed. The ICO at one time ran its own diversification fund. The price collapse after the suspension of export quotas in mid-1989 cost coffee exporting countries an estimated $4bn These hopes are now seen to have been unrealistic. Far from promoting diversification, arti- ficially high commodity prices if anyth discouraged it. The collapse of most of the interna- tional commodity agreements left their intended beneficiaries worse off than they were before and there is now a great weariness and disillusionment with them generally, together with a willingness to go back to open markets with all their imperfections and hardships for producers. The disillusion- ment is not confined to com- modity importing countries: opposition to the ICO's quota arrangements has also come from exporters - notably Bra- zil. However, there remains a job to be done, and one to which international commod- ity agreements, properly struc- tured, could make a big contri- bution. For this to happen, however, changes need to be made to their declared objectives. The aim of price support should be abandoned and replaced unequivocally by price stabills- atlon; and Instead of limiting supply, the prime purpose of the International Coffee Agree- ment (and of international commodity agreements gener- ally) should be to Increase demand. These apparently small changes would in prac- tice be dicult to neotate, especially with producers; without them, the Interna- tional Coffee Agreement has little future. Of the two tasks, of stabilis- ing prices and increasing demand, the first is the easier, and could be achieved by replacing the present compli- cated system of export quotas with a buffer stock. This would also solve two of the existing ICA's most pressing problems: quota allocation, and the exis- tence of a two-tier market, with lower prices to non-quota countries. Admittedly, buffer stocks have gained a bad reputation as part of international com- modity agreements. Undes- ervedly so: the principal cause of failure of buffer stocks has been their use as part of price support mechanisms. As the record of the current Interna- tional Natural Rubber Agree- ment shows, buffer stocks can be made to work effectively as part of a price stabilisation sys- tem. Without accumulating a crippang burden of stock and debt n Ir has been so success- fal in stablising the price of natural rubber that the London terminal market has had to close for lack of business. A buffer stock trading a lim- ited selection of types could do the same for coffee, given two conditions: that it was ade- quately funded; and that inter- vention price bands were allowed to move with market trends, instead of being set in concrete by members. The other aim, of increasing demand for coffee, is easier said than done. Promotion is already written into the ICA, but there is much more that could be done in the way of demand management. As a matter of policy (and a policy formulating body is something the organisation has needed for years) the ICA should adopt the wider aim of narrowing the gap between coffee producers and roasters and also - though the gap is already rela- tively small - between roast- ers and final consumers. Tradition and the large num- ber and diversity of producers make this a difficult task. Like most commodities - especially those consumed a long way from where they are produced - coffee is in effect abandoned to its fate on the market by its producers, who take little fur- ther interest in what happens to it afterwards. The export marketing initiatives under- taken by the Colombians are the exception that proves the rule. Alec Gordon, Commodities Edi- tor at the Economist Intelligence . Unit helped to draft the 1976 International Coffee Agreement.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney CRA, THE Australian resources group, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, yesterday won approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board to develop the Century zinc deposit in north-west Queensland. Century contains about 140m tonnes of ore containing 10 per cent zinc, making it one of the world's five biggest zinc deposits. The ore also contains small amounts of lead and silver. CRA needed the board's per- mission to acquire the Lawn Hill Station, the cattle ranch which surrounds the deposit, about 200 km (125m) north of MIM's major copper, lead and zinc mines at Mount Isa. The mine could be operating by 1995, and is estimated to be capable of earning up to A$500m a year, mostly in export sales. CRA will decide next year whether to go ahead with the mine at a develop- ment cost of about A$750m. The board's announcement follows government attempts to reassure the resources industry in the wake of its decision to block a gold mining project at Coronation Hill, in the Northern Territory, after protests from aborigines that the mine would offend their religious beliefs. The industry was also disap- pointed by the government's failure to relax regulations on uranium mining to allow devel- opment of a large deposit at Jabiluka, in the Northern Territory, recently sold by Pan- continental to Energy Resources of Australia for A$125m. Both decisions were seen as tests of the government's com- mitment to the development of Australia's natural resources in the face of environmental and aboriginal opposition. Mr Alan Griffths, the federal resources minister, said the government was \"100 per cent\" behind the development of Century, which would make a major contribution to reducing Australia's large current account deficit. He criticised \"vocal\" environmental lobby groups for dominating debate on the balance between devel- opment and the environment, sometimes against the national interest. He said Australia needed a \"stronger development ethic,\" and called for government pol- icy to be directed towards \"how projects should proceed rather than if they should pro- ceed.\" His comments followed calls by other ministers including Senator John Button, the industry minister, and Mr Simon Crean, primary indus- tries minister, for a more active government role in pro- moting development. Pro-development ministers have persuaded the federal cabinet to discuss \"fast track- ing\" a number of major resources projects to avoid delays caused by inquiries into their impact on the environ- ment and aborigines. However, business groups remain worried by the influ- ence of environmental and aboriginal lobbyists and criti- cal of the slow progress being made towards the development of a national policy on ecologi- cally sustainable development. The Business Council of Aus- tralia, which represents most major companies, said in a report yesterday that nine draft ESD reports released recently were \"replete with options which would damage the development of Australia's competitive industries.\" The Liberal opposition also claimed that confusion about the government's attitude to resource development had led to the cancellation or delay of projects worth A$15bn. Mr lan McLaughlin, the shadow Indus- try Minister, said projects were becoming entangled in \"green and black tape,\" and warned that fast tracking of some pro- jects would cause further delays for others. \"The lack of certainty [in government policy] is meaning that Australians are simply not investing where they should be,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR slipped back yesterday as disappointment set in that it had not success- fully cleared the DM1.70 bar- rier last week when the market attempted a short-lived rally. But with the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets closed the dol- lar's move down was exagger- ated by the lack of liquidity in the currency markets. Besides technical factors, the dollar was also depressed by a growing belief that the eco- nomic recovery currently underway in the US is weak. Less growth means less demand for dollars and cur- rency analysts believe this week's set of economic statis- tics will give little ground for optimism. August durable goods fig- ures released tomorrow are expected to show a monthly decline of 4.5 per cent, while many analysts also forecast sluggish August personal income and consumption data (released on Friday). The gloom in the foreign exchange markets contrasts with the US government's pre- diction that the economy will rebound more strongly this year. Mr Michael Boskin, chair- man of the president's council of economic advisers, again repeated his forecast of 2'4/-3 per cent growth in gross national product during the second half of this year. While analysts continue to dispute the strength of the economy's revival, the dollar is likely to trade in a narrow range. Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank forecasts that it will stay this week between DM1.65-1.69. The dollar closed lower at DM1.6725 from DM1.6870; at SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4730; at Y133.00 from Y134.40; and at FFr5.6975 from PFr5.7450. The Bank of England's dollar index fell 0.6 to 64.5. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta came under pressure as speculation persisted that lower inflation would allow the Spanish monetary authorities to reduce interest rates. The Deutschemark rose to Pta62.93-55 from Pta62.80-83 on Friday, while the peseta's lead within the ERM against the system's weakest currency, the French franc, narrowed. Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said the impact of the peseta's weakness had been to lower sterling's Aefec- tive floor against the D-Mark to DM2.8650 from DM2.8775 on Friday. Currency dealers had nitially marked sterling lower against the' DMark to take account of this, he said. Sterling closed higher at $1.7440 from $1.7275; and at FFr9.9875 from FFr9.9250; but was unchanged at DM2.9150; at SFr2.5450; and at Y232.00. Ster- ling's index rose 0.1 point to 91.1. The D-Mark was firmer as talk of higher inflation led to expectations of higher money market rates. This was reflected in the futures market, where the December Euro- mark contract fell 8 to 90.64. Suggestions that Swiss infla- tion is likely to rise in the com- ing months supported the franc, which was buoyed by firm Swiss money market rates.

   "text_content" : "UK MONEY market rates were slightly firmer yesterday as sterling's weakness within the European exchange rate mech- anism dampened hopes for an early cut in base rates. Three-months inter-bank money was quoted at 10%-% per cent, up * point on Fri- day's closing levels; six months was unchanged at 10r-% per cent; and twelve months money was also steady at Oi-A per cent. The futures market responded more directly to the weakness in sterling. The UK dlarlg t hI e rft km spowr 4, \"1\" December short sterling contract fell 6 points to 90.14, implying an interest rate of 99A per cent by the end of the year and a base rate of 10 per cent. Money. market dealers said sterling's decline against European currncies had put back a reduction in UK nterest rates. The firmnes in market rates allowed the Bank oa Egland to adopt a more credit polcy by pp the market with more Uiuty than it need. The Bank bought a total of 72m, copared with its Parecat o a tagl Iulty aortage. All the liquidity provided was by way of Treasury bills and bank bills in bands 1 and 2 at unchanged rates of 10% per cent. During the morning, the Bank bought Â£8m of bills; after lunch it purchased a further Â£194m. When late assistance of Â£370m was provided overnight money briefly fell to 6 per cent before closing at around 10% per cent. Dealers are expecting a relatively quiet week in the short-term UK debt markets. The Â£1.5bn gilt auction tomorrow being partly paid is only expected to drain around oo300om. The release of opinion polls later in the week will also be closely scrutinised, although many operators now believe there is unlikely to be a general election this year. In FrankWfrt money market rates eased slightly for short-term technical reasons although the upwad pressure on German rates has not yet abated. Call money was at 9O9.060 per cent from 9.004.10 per cent on Friay. The return of S to the maret last wee, as securities issued by the state of Rast Germany fell due was one reason for the ser tone in rates. News that the Bundesbank had set a lower-than-expected provisional September rsre requirement of DM71.Sbn arks also led to an eatg ha rai",

   "text_content" : "GROWING confidence in the chances both for recovery from eco- nomic recession and for lower interest rates in the leading industrial countries kept world stock markets steady last week. However, there were signs that investors are reas- sessing near-term prospects for markets in the US and Japan, as well as in Germany and France. The modest improvement over the week of 0.2 per cent in the FT-Actuaries World Index in local currency terms owed a great deal to another strong performance from the US. But there are question marks over the dollar and the technical outlook for Wall Street, accord- ing to Mr Michael Howell of Salomon International. Technical indicators, includ- ing the number of US stocks striking new highs, suggest that Wall Street is moving into a dangerously overbought situ- ation, and some global strate- gists are turning cautious on the US in the short term. Increasing the significance of these doubts over the US were signs last week of a move by investors into Japanese equi- ties, often at the expense of other Pacific Basin markets. Strategists noted the surge in the Japanese bond market and expect this to fuel a sub- stantial rise in equities over the next few weeks; Japan has identified itself as highly sensi- tive to movements in bond yields. Interest rate factors contin- ued to dominate in Europe, By Terry Byland and William Cochrane with the exception of the UK stock market, where a fall of 1 per cent last week reflected dire news on the effects of recession on profits at several leading companies. Expectations of lower inter- est rates focused on France, 0.2 per cent up last week as inves- tors anticipated an upward move by bonds, which would lay the foundation for success in equities. Germany came under a cloud, falling 1.6 per cent as investors took the view that, in spite of lower rates elsewhere, the Bundesbank's stance still points to higher interest rates - the Lombard at 9.5 per cent by November, predicts DKB International. From a technical viewpoint, too, Fraice looks more attrac- tive than Germany, according toMr ichardLake of Hoare Govett. The Paris CAC General and QAC 40 indices are both moving through lines of resis- tance, and many leading French shares are now in firm uptrends, contrary to Ger- many, which seems to be waiting for momentum, he says. Spain presents a similar pic- ture to Germany from a techni- cal angle, and could move either way, says Mr Lake. Last week, however, the market was pushed higher by a sharp rally in Telef6nica, the tele- coms group, which announced changes in its dividend policy. Last week's worst perform- ers within Europe were the Nordic markets. Sweden, for example, reduced its substan- tial gains on the year with a fall on the week of 2.2 per cent in local currency terms. Mr DavidLongmulr of James Capel says Stockholm was ner- vously waiting for a working government to be put together .AL .AL FT-A Wordd Indices in local currencies (rebased) souro.: sOams. after the country's general elections. But he added that the falls came in thin volume. Norway had its political wor- ries, too. Local elections two weeks ago showed that the government was increasingly unpopular, and while the coun- try has low inflation and good corporate earnings prospects, analysts are worried about the risks of an expansionary bud- get and a trade deficit. Mr Longmuir says Norwe- gian business feels excluded from the European game, with EFTA/EC talks running into the sand again, and that there has been nothing in oil prices for the equity market to bite upon. Even talk of a global recovery in shipping is unlikely to lift the Oslo mar- ket, which tends to look at tanker rates first, rather than general shipping prospects. Scandinavia's biggest fall came in Finland on continued devaluation rumours. The gov- ernment has been pushing hard to get Finnish labour to accept a 10 per cent pay cut across the board, and thus achieve an internal devalua- tion. The country, however, is demoralised and market senti- ment is weak. On Thursday, too, there was yet another Scandinavian banking distress story as the Bank of Finland took control of Skopbank, the central bank for the country's 115 savings insti- tutions, which had been hit by economic recession and the slump in the property market. For Far Eastern markets, the big picture last week was the herd instinct of institutions wanting to go overweight in Tokyo, and withdrawing funds from south-east Asia in conse- quence, says Mr David Bates of Asia Equity. Japan's relatively strong per- formance came in active trad- ing. While trading volume peaked in Tokyo at 1.2bn shares on Friday, September 13, it stayed relatively high last week at an average 555m shares a day. Meanwhile, Malaysia saw what Mr Bates describes as pre-budget excitement, with rumour treated as news and a lot of negative rumours going around. For example, tobaccos tumbled on fears that there would be a total ban on tobacco advertising in Malay- sia; the rumour mongers, he says, ignored the fact that the country's tobacco industry employs 300,000 people in polit- ically sensitive states. Singapore saw resurfacing rumours of resignations on the political front, and a senior director of DBS Bank - Malay- sia's biggest, and heavily weighted in local indices - selling a large line of stock into the market. This coincided with negative analysts' reports on the bank. Additional reporting by Jacqueline Moore.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street IN THE absence of a strong lead, either from the bond mar- ket or from economic data, share prices moved in a nar- row trading range on either side of opening values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.72 at 3,010.51. The more broadly-based Standard & Poor's 500 lost more ground than the blue-chip index, fall- ing 2.00 to 385.92, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the- counter stocks, undermined by weak biotechnology stocks, shed 2.50 at 524.69. Turnover on the NYSE was 143m shares, and declines outnumbered advances by 912 to 640. After opening firmer on mod- est buying, shares fell back on reports from the Middle East that Iraqi soldiers were holding the United Nations team of inspectors investigating Iraq's nuclear weapons facilities. Investors were also reluctant to commit large sums to the market ahead of this week's economic data. Shawmut National dropped $1%/ to $8% in active trading as further doubts were raised about the bank's merger with Bank of Boston. Although some reports state that the two groups have agreed on the deal, others suggest that the prospective partners have not yet raised the financing for the merger. Bank of Boston eased $l'% to $9%. The repercussions of the Treasury auction bid-rigging scandal continued to eat away at Salomon's stock price. The shares fell a further $% to $21% on turnover of 1.8m as investors worried about the civil and criminal penalties the company may face because of its wrongdoings. In particular, the likelihood that the Securi- ties and Exchange Commission will levy hundreds of million dollars of fines is undermining support for Salomon shares. The conclusion of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel that there was no evidence to link Eli Lilly's drug Prozac with suicide or violent acts helped the drug manufacturers' stock early on, but profit-taking and weakness in other drug stocks took hold and by the. close Eli Lilly shares were down $2 at $81%. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, Synergen dropped $7%' to $59% on turnover of 1.6m after Mr Stuart Weisbrod, at Merrill Lynch, cut his intermediate- term rating from \"neutral\" to \"sell\"; he cited stiff competi- tion from rival drug companies for Synergen's Antril product, which may be filed for FDA approval by the end of this year. Synergen shares have risen 400 per cent over the past 12 months, largely on hopes of big sales for Antril. But Mr Weisbrod predicts that the drug will have US sales of $100m in 1995 as it captures only 15 per cent of a frag- mented market. Image Bank soared $1% to $6% after the company entered a definitive pact to be acquired by a unit of Eastman Kodak for $6.75 a share, or $24.9m. East- man Kodak edged $%( higher to $42%. Canada Toronto share prices closed a bit lower in moderate trading. Based on preliminary figures, the composite index fell 10.48 to 3,396.61 as decline in con- sumer products, energy, sinan- cial services and industrial products showed smaller Golds went against the over- all trend, gaining 1.97 per cent as the price of gold rose $2 an ounce to $350.75 an ounce in New York. Onex Corp. said it has agreed to sell its Beatrice Foods unit to Merrill Lynch for C$475m, resulting in an after- tax gain of C$85m. The stock was up C$S% to C$10%.",

   "text_content" : "PACIFIC RIM markets turned to domestic matters yesterday in the absence of Tokyo for a holiday. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Seoul and Bombay were also closed. NEW ZEALAND was pulled lower by the recent string of disappointing earnings reports and downgradings of forecasts for future profits. The NZSE-40 index fell 23.76 or 1.7 per cent to 1,378.85 in turnover of NZ$llm, down from NZ$16m. Brierley Investments declined 3 cents to 94 cents in volume of 1.3m shares. The trading and hotels group is expected to report a sharp drop in earnings and possibly a divi. dend cut this week. AUSTRALIA saw BHP attain a record high of A$14.05 in early trading before closing at A$14, up 10 cents, in the wake of better than expected quar- terly profits. The All Ordinaries index added 02 at 1,562.8 in turnover of A$132m, after A$262m. BTR Nylex lost 6 cents to A12.61 on fears that the bid by its UK parent for Hawker Siddeley would affect the local unit. About 8.35m shares were traded, with brokers ANZ McCaughan handling a special sale involving 5.9m shares. MANILA was lifted by short- covering and bargain hunting. The composite index rose 7.47 to 912.75 in turnover of 53.8m pesos, down from 12Sm. SINGAPORE firmed on bar- gain hunting. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 12.23 to 1,390.78, but volume was the second lowest this year at 16.8m shares. KUALA LUMPUR edged lower on its return from a three-day weekend. The com- posite index shed 3.68 to 520.57 In light turnover of M$52m, down from M$85m. Telekom Malaysia receded 25 cents to M.859 on 1m shares traded. BANGKOK eased in quiet trading, although textiles and some other second-line shares moved against the trend. The SET Index slipped 7.06 to 704.84 in turnover of BtlS5bn. JAKARTA's index lost a fur- ther 1.75 to 253.09 after last week's drop of 13.7 per cent. Volume came to 2.73m shares and there were limited signs of revival in some share prices.",

   "text_content" : "NORTHERN BOURSES were largely neglected yesterday as investors continued to concen- trate on the Latin bloc, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed at another 1991 high on the first day of the new account. The CAC 40 index ended 2.86 up at 1,888.35, after rising to 1,897.26 earlier in the session. Turnover shrank to FFrl.5bn by the official close from Friday's FFr3.5bn. Cement makers were weak after Friday's disappointing interim results from Ciments Francais, which saw its shares fall FFr9.50 or 2.9 per cent to FFr322.50. Lafarge Coppde dropped FFr11.90 or 3.1 per cent to FFr373.50 in volume of 105,870 shares. Among the day's other los- ers, Pechiney International fell FFr5.60 or 3.2 per cent to FFr170.40 after last week's results and its recent specula- tive rally, and Au Printemps, the retailer, shed FFrl4 to FFr864. Au Printemps had risen recently on rumours that Maus Fr6res would sell its stake, reinforced at the week- , end by the news that the Swiss holding company has appointed Goldman Sachs to advise on possible asset sales. Michelin, which announces first-half figures today, reached a year's high of FFrl31 before closing at FFr128.10, up 50 cen- times. Analysts expect an interim loss of about FFrl.5bn. MADRID moved higher on hopes of a cut in interest rates at Thursday's Treasury bill auction. The general index added 1.51 to 278.12. Turnover remained active at about Ptal5bn, but down from Fri- day's Pta24bn. Telef6nica gave up some of its recent gains, falling Pta35 to Ptal,125 in vol- ume of 2.9m shares. FRANKFURT saw volume halve to DM2.9bn as the FAZ index rose 0.46 to 667.43 at mid- session and the DAX index fell 1.91 to 1,614.16 at the close. Banks, carmakers and chem- icals were mostly flat, and price movements were mainly in illiquid stocks.

In basic materials, both Metallgesellschaft and Degussa fell by DM5 to DM342 and DM472 respectively. There were reports that a German bank had downgraded Metall- gesellschaft because of weak metal prices. Constructions were weak, Holzmann leading the way down with a drop of DM20 to DM1,240. It looked as if fore- casts of much slower growth a fortnight ago from Iso, the eco- nomic research institute, were coming back to haunt the industry. On the brighter side, MAN continued to respond to a very good set of results, put- ting on DM4.50 to DM382.50. AMSTERDAM was depressed by a fall in London and in the dollar. The CBS tendency index closed 0.7 lower at 90.7. Borsumij Wehry, the distri- bution company, initially dropped F110 before closing Fl 6 lower at Fl 55 following its gloomy results and full-year forecast on Friday. Concerns that its chief executive was ill also weighed on the stock. Philips eased 20 cents to Fl 35.20 on profit-taking. STOCKHOLM waited for the formation of a new govern- ment, due to be announced today. The Affirsvirlden Gen- eral index fell 2.1 to 1,069.2. Volume soared from SKr324m to SKr830m, the high- est figure so far this year, as Nordbanken formally took over financier Mr Erik Penser's 51m shares in Nobel Industrier in the wake of its liquidity cri- sis. Nobel accounted for SKr615m, as its free shares fell SKrI to SKr38. MILAN fell on fresh fears that the governing coalition would fail to bring in neces- sary measures to trim the bud- get deficit. The Comit index fell 5.61 to 544.22 in turnover estimated at more than Fri- day's L76bn. Mediobanca, which reported a 5 per cent fall in first-half net profits on Friday, slipped L100 to L15,050. Fiat fell L147 or 2.7 per cent to L5,326 while the agro-industrial and chemical group Montedison lost L32 to L1,200.

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor A DOWNTURN in the UK government's electoral rating as measured by the latest pub- lic opinion polls, the near cer- tainty of a new Â£300m rights issue at mid-week, and confir- mation that the UK trade defi- cit widened significantly last month, all helped to depress UK stocks yesterday. Trading volume was light, but at the close the market was testing its 60-day moving aver- age, a development which caused concern among the chart specialists. Interest rate hopes were dimmed by ster- ling's weakness within the European exchange rate mech- anism and by firmer money rates in London. The speculative enthusiasm which buoyed share prices on Friday largely melted away yesterday, but there was no ApemoM a Debe abs Oporn - H Sep 1i Sp 30 Oct 14 eSp Oct 10 Oct 24 Sep Oct 11 Oct 2 Octt Oct 21 Nov4 let-up in the pace of profits downgradings for British com- .panies by City analysts. Low- ered forecasts for several lead- ing stocks, including Rank Organisation, counter-balanced a positive survey of business opinion from the Confederation of British Industry. Initial losses in shares were very slight, however, and most of the fall of 20 points on the Fr-SE Index reflected a general downward drift rather than significant selling pressure. An attempt to rally was thwarted when Wall Street opened the new session somewhat coolly, to show a dip of 1.79 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average during UK trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,579.5 for a loss on the day of 20.8. Strategists pointed out that the market was challenging its 60-day moving average, a rating which survived even during the tumultuous reaction to the abortive Soviet coup in August; the 60-day average was last broken in June this year, an event followed by a heavy setback in the equity market. Turnover was unimpressive yesterday, with only 349.7m shares traded through the Seaq system, compared with 673.8m on Friday. Stock Exchange data confirm that retail, or cus- tomer, business was heavy last week when the market was falling; on Thursday, retail business totalled Â£5bn, equal- ling Wednesday's level and exceeding Tuesday's Â£1.3bn. Widespread reports in the UK press that Asda, the trou- bled food supermarket group, plans a Â£300m rights issue this week. added to the caution shown by institutional inves- tors. While there were no new shocks on the corporato front, sentiment remained unsettled in the aftermath of last week's poor results and rights issue from British Aerospace which is believed to have brought pressure for the resignation of the chairman. The deficit of Â£543m on UK current account in August was more than twice some City forecasts and traders were dis- mayed by the weakness of ster- lipg, yhich threatens interest rate prospects. The UK stock market has taken a further reduction of half a point in UK base rates almost for granted, even if it proves to be the last for some time. ICI provided a lone firm spot among the international blue chips, which were mostly held back by worries over the out- look for the US dollar, in which most of their profits are earned. The privatisation water issues were held back by public opinion polls indicating revived support for the opposi- tion Labour party. The changing patterns of the opinion polls have revived uncertainty over the prospects for the date of a general elec- tion in the UK,",

   "text_content" : "BROKERAGE recommendat- ions among blue chips saw BOC and ICI benefit from switching by institutions out of Courtaulds. Institutional bro- ker James Capel recommended clients to shift funds into BOC. It compared the company with Courtaulds and found it to be at a 10 per cent discount on price/earnings ratio, at a yield premium of 37 per cent, and trading some 30 per cent cheaper on cash earnings. Capel recommended switch- ing into BOC but traders said some funds also found their way into ICI. In addition, three large trades in ICI and some persistent bidding on inter-dealer broker screens triggered renewed, but widely disregarded, talk that Hanson was increasing its 2.8 per cent stake. Courtaulds weakened 16 to 464p and ICI added 11 at 1287p on solid turnover. BOC ended 2 up at 573p, after touching 577p - 2.7m shares changed hands, representing the busiest day's trade in the stock since June. Rank challenged News filtering back to the UK from the Rank Organisa- tion analysts' trip to the US prompted at least two securi- ties houses to lower profits forecasts. BZW said that at a presenta- tion in Orlando, Florida, the company had painted a \"bleak picture\" of the prospects for its US businesses. The house reduced its current year profits forecast by Â£20m to Â£250m and next year's by Â£45m to Â£300m. UBS Phillips & Drew left its current year estimate unchanged at Â£250m and moved next year's from Â£300m to Â£270m. Rank was 30 lower at one point before ending at 677p for a net decline of 26. Trading vol- ume was light. ECC favoured Interim figures from ECC, the world's largest supplier of china clay, pleased the stock market and inspired favoura- ble profits forecasts from City analysts. The shares climbed 11 to 469p on a healthy turn- over of 2.1m. The market had expected a figure below Â£50m but the com- pany announced profits of Â£53.5m, and most analysts were positive after their meeting with the company. Mr Richard Rae of Hoare Govett strength- ened his buy stance and raised his full-year forecast by Â£7m to Â£106m, at the top end of the observers' range. He was encouraged by ECC's cost reductions and the perfor- mance of its new management. Mr Geoff Alum of County NatWest was less enthusiastic: \"Much of the good news is in the price. There are still prob- lems in the aggregates sector and the European economy, but we remain positive in the long term.\" BAe stays weak Suggestions in the press that Professor Roland Smith, chair- man of British Aerospace, was under pressure to resign, after the recent poor performance of the group and the widely leaked rights issue, served to unsettle the shares. They closed 8 lower at 420p, although turnover was a rela- tively sedate 268,000 shares. Specialists said institutions, upset by the bad figures, rights issue and what is seen as a need for asset disposals, were looking for a scapegoat. BT declined to 389p before steadying to close 41/2 off at 390/2p after BZW, joint lead manager in the UK for the sale of the government's remaining stake in BT, published a near 100-page research document on the group. National Power maintained its recent good form, closing 3% higher at 165p on substan- tial turnover of 4.7m. There was strong support for the stock from, among others, one of the leading UK broking firms, and renewed good demand from the US. Power- Gen lagged behind, closing marginally firmer at 178%p. The latest opinion poll, showing Labour with a four- point lead over the Conserva- tives, put more pressure on water issues, which were addi- tionally unsettled by worries about Ofwat, the water indus- try watchdog, which is expec- ted to report next month on general pricing in the water industry. Anglian Water lost 5 to 379p, North West 4 to 370p and Thames 3 to 379p. Oil shares gave a poor response to rising crude oil prices, which reflected growing unease over the situation between the United Nations and Iraq. Today brings the meeting of Opec's market mon- itoring committee, which is expected to sanction a rise in Opec's output ceiling to 24m barrels a day and to reaffirm Opec's commitment to its $21 a barrel oil price. Shell was notably weak, los- ing 7 to 493p, with a number of brokers said to have been per- sistent sellers of the stock. Mr Peter Holmes, Shell's chair- man, said at an oil conference held in London that oil prices are low at current levels and likely to remain low for some years to come. BP eased 2 to 329p; the com- pany is giving a presentation to oil sector analysts on Thurs- day with the emphasis on its refining and marketing busi- nesses. Ultramar retreated 7 to 234p, suffering, dealers said, from more selling by index-tracking funds; the stock was dropped from the Footsie index last week. Turnover in Clyde Petro- leum (unchanged at 94p) shot up to 6m shares after a put- through of 3m at 94p a share. Today brings interim figures from Tarmac, with BZW looking for profits of Â£20m, sharply down from Â£97.8m. Recent suggestions of another cash-raising exercise are thought to be wide of the mark and the group is expected to hold the interim dividend; but the market is bracing itself for what is expected to be the gloomiest of statements regard- ing its housebuilding division. The shares lost 10 to 201p. Lep Group dropped like a stone, closing 51 off at 36p after Equity Shares Traded Turover by volume (million) Excluding: Intra-maket businems & Overseas turnover JEql Turr Exluc Imnt- 600 400 200 mai actii ing pro] war its Â£10.- the pan: in t ban] lowi will this tion for-t 40p be ] groi grea aboi instj thel hea~ weel US supl coni stor spec bett 5at poss to3 brol stoc sha: thei Tho in shai afte ted ing 20p tota marketmakers took evasive action and chopped their deal- ing levels. The distribution, property and security group warned that its half-time prof- its would fall to Â£1.9m from Â£10.4m and that it would pass the interim dividend. The com- pany also said it was involved in refinancing talks with its bankers. Asda retreated 4 to 66p fol- lowing press reports that there will be a Â£300m rights issue this week. There was specula- tion in the market that a one- for-two or one-for-three issue at 40p to 50p is likely. Suggestions that a bid could be launched for the troubled grocery chain prevented a greater fall, although worries about willingness of the larger institutional holders to take up their rights weighed more heavily on sentiment. Last week the shares were lifted by US buying but yesterday that support had evaporated. Last week's bid excitement continued to echo around the stores sector. Yesterday the speculation centred on Sears, 4 better at 93p. Kingfisher, down 5 at 551p, was mentioned as a possible predator. Standard Chartered eased 3 to 351p after one of the big US brokers bought a large line of stock, thought to have been 1m shares, at 344p and placed them at 347p. Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson took pride of place in the insurance area, the shares moving up 10 to 424p after much better than expec- ted preliminary figures, show- ing profits up 35 per cent and a 20 per cent rise in the dividend total. Worsted spinner John Hag- FT.A AIIShare Index gas forged ahead 13 to 95p fol- lowing positive weekend press comment and recent strong results. Marketing consultancy Holmes & Marchant warned that profits for the year would be 40 per cent below City esti- mates of around Â£3.5m. Ana- lysts obliged by reducing their forecasts by 40 per cent. The shares fell 11 to 88p. A weekend press profile of the chief executive of advertis- ing group Abbott Mead Vick- ers helped the shares buck the wider market's trend and gain 7 to 355p. Poster advertising specialist More O'Ferrall added 6 at 283p ahead of interims expected on Friday. BET relinquished 10 to 209p as a number of analysts took the red pen to their forecasts for the company. UBS Phillips & Drew reflected the mood, cutting its estimate for full- year profits by Â£20m to Â£174m. Brewery equipment manu- facturer Alumasc, which reported last Wednesday, picked up 13 to 335p. BZW has the company on its buy list. Funeral services group PFG Hodgson Kenyon slipped 5 to 70p, reflecting a sharp fall in interim profits and a halved dividend.

   "text_content" : "DERIVATIVES traders paused for breath yesterday following the hectic, speculative trading of previous days, writes Peter John. On the Liffe, there was a gentle unwinding of the Sep- tember Footsie future, which expires next Monday. As the contract approached its esti- mated fair value premium to the underlying cash market, traders bought the future and sold stock. This, coupled with speculation that there will be a considerable amount of stock overhanging the market on expiry, has been responsible for some of the weakness in the cash market recently. Mr Harvey Neale of UBS Phillips& Drew said: \"I do not think there is much downside risk left now, but nor do I think there will be a big rally before the start of October.\" Futures traders were also discouraged from rolling their September future contracts into December as the spread between the two remained unprofitably low yesterday. September closed at 2,588 for a premium of 11 to cash. On the LTOM, turnover was desultory at 17,245 contracts. Sears and Allied-Lyons were busy as traders took profits following Friday's bid talk. The share price of RTZ was affected by a short synthetic in the November 550 series.",

   "text_content" : "JUST as most areas of international banking have suffered from the effects of eco- nomic recession over the past year, so the days of effortless expansion are a distant mem- ory for the leading participants in global custody. It is now evi- dent that the world's settle- ment infrastructure, the sub- ject of so much hand-wringing after the October crash in 1987, is a behemoth. Global custody is a cross-bor- der banking product adminis- tering hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assets on behalf of investment funds trustees and their fund manag- ers. Custodians not only ensure the physical safety of assets, but also handle a range of set- tlement and reporting func- tions for their clients. Increas- ingly, custodians also want to handle specialist services such as portfolio valuations and securities lending. It is becoming increasingly clear that custody is a long-term business demanding continuous capital commit- ment - a tall order for banks suffering from inadequate capi- tal and the need for short-term performance. Meanwhile, the Group of Thirty's efforts notwithstand- ing, progress towards the reduction of systemic ineffi- ciencies is proving much slower and more uneven than had been hoped. Witness, for example, the struggle to intro- duce the Taurus system in the UK. Despite a strong collective will to stick to an agreed time- table, it looks certain that the May 1992 deadline will be missed. Hold-ups such as the argument over securities num- bering described below are for- cing a greater realism on the custody market. In the 1980s, as cross-border investment flows gained in size and strength, bankers enjoyed a huge increase in the reve- nues earned by custody and related functions such as secu- rities lending. But as quickly as the busi- ness had expanded, it came to a sharp stop when the world economic cycle went into reverse during the second half of 1990. Funds considering the appointment of a global custo- dian often put their decisions on hold until they could gain a clearer picture of the depth and severity of the economic recession. Alternatively, they simply decided to reduce their asset allocation for overseas investments, and thereby reduced the pool of custody business. Neither of these develop- ments altered the favourable long-term trends for cross-bor- der investment, but for the banks, with their fixed costs in the shape of office overheads and complex computer systems, the downturn came at an extremely inconvenient time. The imposition of the Basle capital adequacy standards was putting bank balance sheets under embarrassing scrutiny, while simulta- neously, the lending excesses of the 1980s were beginning to wreak havoc in the shape of general provisions against bad debts. Managers of custody depart- ments have invariably found that their calls for further capi- tal are going unheard or ignored in the face of compet- ing shouts. This is ironic, for it suggests that the banks have not learned much from previ- ous recessions - custody may not be glamorous, but it does provide a relatively stable reve- nue stream, which in times of pressure should be at a pre- mium. There are those who escape this pessimistic diagnosis of the banks' ailments, but the problems of the wider interna- tional banking system have simply made clearer what some custody executives were saying before the good times had ended: that custody had become over-exposed and was in danger of misleading its cus- tomer base. These warnings reached a peak last year when some banks began to tout the idea that custody, provided it incor- porated a' securities lending programme, could be a net source of revenue. In other words, far from being an unavoidable element of portfo- lio costs, custody could make a positive contribution to a fund's income stream. Claims for the product are less grandi- ose today, although it remains true that securities lending, particularly cross-border activ- ity, can significantly enhance returns. Not only are the interna- tional custodian banks basing their planning on more conser- vative revenue assumptions, they are also falling back on their perceived strengths in an \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t While custodians are finding that recession has brought the easy expansion of recent vears to a arinding halt, the slow progress being made on the ironing out of infrastructural inefficiencies is forcing a mood of profound realism on the industry, as Andrew Freeman discovers effort to convince existing cus- tomers not to move their busi- ness. That has led to what one bank calls \"stratification\", whereby operators have sorted themselves into categories of service provision. New participants have been much less evident than they have in recent years, although the merger of banks such as Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank, and Bank of America and Security Pacific, has created the impression of activity. However, in the UK a long- established class of custody providers has taken up arms against the perception that it is I sleepy and complacent. t London's fund managers have traditionally controlled large asset pools through their own back office operations. In April this year, the largest among them, Mercury Asset i Management, announced that r henceforth its back office would become an independent f operation as a division of S G Warburg, the merchant bank. The Custody and Investor Services division has MAM as its largest client, but it has already added to its impressive base of 450 clients and now has some Â£30bn under custody. In addition, it handles administra- tion of funds worth Â£10bn. With such a base, Warburg hardly qualifies as a new par- ticipant, but its entry into direct competition with the established banks represents an important development in the custody market. Other fund managers might be tempted to launch their back offices in similar fashion. Or they might follow the lead of at least two of their number who, since April have hired Warburg on a private-label basis - that is, the customers remain unaware that their fund manager sub-contracts settlement and custody to a third party. Private-labelling is not yet so established as a practice that one can described a trend towards it, but many industry observers think it points the way to the business of the future. Mr Hastings Read, a consul- tant with the US-based Hamp- ton Group, has argued persua- sively that the banks' central position in the custody and securities processing markets owes much to their historical spread of well-protected facili- ties. However, as securities become immobilised or are eliminated altogether, they will simply be treated as account- ing entries. Processing securi- ties will then become an infor- mation-based service requiring a quite different base of skills to that currently possessed by the banks. Given the rapid pace of tech- nological change, there must be a danger that many of today's participants will be unable to respond. The poten- tial impact of computer work- stations on the sector is great and technology will continue to drive the economics of the custody business. It is worth pointing out that even the largest of today's global custodians can not take their survival for granted. Mr Read points out that 40 per cent of the US master trust/ custody business is shared between four banks, with a fur- ther six banks controlling a third of the market. Of the top four, no single i bank can claim to dominate the market, while their relative positions have shifted with alarming frequency over recent years. Custody has come a long way since the mid-1980s. As a service, it has barely begun the cycle of product improvement and adaptation. But already one can see the vague delinea- tion of the next generation of providers and not all of them will be banks.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "THE last status report published by the Group of Thirty (G30) - the interna- tional group of financial and economic experts - in April this year, presented itself as a model of international zo-operation. It reported \"sig- nificant progress\" and prom- ised \"a surge of reforms\" in the aext two years. But the eupho- ia that surrounded the publi- mation of the G30O recommenda- Ions in 1989 is slowly giving way to a new realism. \"The worrying thing about :he G30 programme is that everybody subscribed to it,\" says Mr John Gubert, head of markets developments at Mid- land Securities Services. \"I wouldn't have expected nine core recommendations to get support from such a diversity of markets.\" Mr Gubert's prescription is proving correct as regulators, investors and custodians are beginning to realise that they should be grateful with less than seemed possible in 1989. But the criticisms should not be overplayed. The G30 can feel proud of its achievements; the development of efficient clearing and settlement is on the agenda of most of the world's stock exchanges. Radical restructuring is under way in Japan, the UK, Australia, Hong Kong and France. Those markets, such as the US and Germany, which were relatively well advanced when the initial nine recom- mendations were published, have moved to reduce settle- ment risk even further. The real problem is not that the securities markets are failing to respond, but that there is a lack of standardisation in the response. The most demanding reform - the adoption of rolling three day settlement (T+3), embod- ied in the seventh recommen- dation - has prompted the most consistent response. Every developed market has recognised the T+3 as a valid goal. The main problem here is one of timing for, with the exception of Germany, Switzer- land and Japan, which are already at T+3 (or less), it seems likely that the 1992 dead- line will be missed by a num- ber of important markets. The UK is still embroiled in the implementation of Taurus and has yet to reach the was over-opumsumc interim goal of rolling T+5 set- tlement. The US securities industry is still dragging its feet over T+3, despite pressure from Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mr Richard Breedon. According to Mr Dennis Earle, executive director of the US working committee of the G30, \"shortening the settle- ment cycle in the US presents Delivery versus payment (DVP) has been taken on board by the world's exchanges a unique problem because of the size of the retail sector\". The problem facing retail brokers is one of collecting cli- ent funds in time to meet the shortened settlement time. A special working party has been set up, under the chairmanship of Mr Louis Bernard, managing director of Morgan Stanley to look at how retail firms can best achieve T+3, and it will be reporting to Mr Breedon later this year. The fifth recommendation of G30, the institution of delivery versus payment (DVP) has, like T+3, been taken on board by the world's exchanges. In almost every case the end result is a different definition of DVP. Germany, for example, insists that it has already met the G30 requirements for DVP, yet the system in place in Frankfurt bears little resem- blance to the systems being discussed in London or Tokyo. Under the German system DVP means the refusal to com- plete a trade if both the securi- ties and the. funds are not available in the Deutscher Kas- senverein (DKV) system, (this rigidity also means that the DKV is reluctant to allow non- bank membership). In London under the Taurus system, DVP will involve a series of bank guarantees aimed at preventing the knock-on effect of one fail pre- venting the settlement of another trade, reflecting the direct participation of a wide range of non-bank institutions in the settlement system. What looked to be the least demanding item on the G30 agenda, recommendation nine seems likely to become the most troublesome. This calls for the adoption of the Interna- tional Organisation for Stan- dardisation's standards for securities messages (ISIN 7775) and securities numbering sys- tem (ISIN 6166). There has been some prog- ress on ISIN 6166 Some mar- kets such as Switzerland and the Netherlands already use ISINs, and both Cedel and Euroclear adopted the stan- dard this year. Japan and the UK have incorporated ISIN 6166 into the plans for their automated settlement systems, Jasdec and Taurus. Elsewhere the response has been less encouraging. Ger- many, for example has decided to keep its own six-digit num- bering system, although the DKV has decided to develop a translation system. The US has as yet made no commitment to ISIN 6166, although Mr Earle insists that this is the result of the priority given to the move to T+3; \"The standardisation of the numbering system was not viewed as part of the critical path of [G30] reforms.\" Work has been done at the staff level and Mr Earle says they will be reporting to the US working committee soon. There is also some confusion over who or what should con- trol the vast database that the international standardisation of the numbering systems will generate. The most likely solu- tion is the creation of a com- mon. network and database called Global ISIN Access Mechanism run by IBM. If the standardisation of securities numbering has capsed headaches, then the implementation of standard messages (ISIN 7775) has left the international investment community with a migraine. The main blow to the standar- disation reforms was the deci- sion taken by Swift in July to prevent fund managers from ecoming members of the organisation and using Swift 500, the most widely used ISIN 7775 standard message system. Some institutions have argued that it was the result of the US banks' wish to prevent the institutions and fund man- agers from establishing their own subcustodian networks, although Mr Curtis Yamaoka, senior vice president at the Bank of New York, disagrees. He cites the fact that the fund managers won a majority of the votes. \"It was unfortu- nate that they were kept out, but I'm confident that the fund managers will be admitted at next year.\" In the interim, as Mr Yamaoka explains, there are alternatives that fund manag- ers can use which meet the ISIN standard. Although they There is nothing stopping fund managers from using the Swift 500 message format are not yet allowed to become members of Swift, there is nothing stopping fund manag- ers from using the Swift 500 message format. The operations manager at a large UK investment house is not convinced by these argu- ments. He complains that the global custodians have tended to embellish the Swift format to the point where it is too time consuming to adapt to the needs of each bank. \"The problem is that if you are dealing with 19 or 20 custo- dians you are dealing with 19 or 20 different message and communications systems,\" he says. The result is that too many trades rely on telex instructions, which in turn makes T+3 on cross border trades more difficult to achieve. Steven Goldman",

   "text_content" : "FROM one perspective Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's automated settlement system, appears as far away as ever. Seemingly always a year from completion, it hangs tantalis- ingly out of reach, a promise of future benefits for the securi- ties industry which so far has brought only substantial devel- opment costs. Recent sugges- tions from the Stock Exchange that next May's launch date will probably be missed rein- forces this image of Taurus as an unattainable goal. That view, however, ignores the huge amount of develop- ment work that has gone on over the past year across the industry, from custodians and brokers to registrars. Behind the scenes, the technical plat- form for Taurus is being put .into place in more than 100 institutions. Testing is due to begin early in the new year. Even most sceptics now believe that Taurus will see the light of day next year - well, perhaps by early in 1993. In one sense, the delays have already wiped out much of the financial benefit Taurus was meant to bring to the securi- ties industry in the form of lower costs. The UK govern- ment said early in 1990 that it would only abolish stamp duty on share dealings when Taurus was introduced. It seemed, at the time, a justified way to gal- vanise the industry into ensur- ing Taurus became a reality. Eighteen months later inves- tors are right to feel aggrieved about the consequent delay in the ending of stamp duty: after all, it was in part the time spent by the government wresting with a new legal framework to accommodate Taurus that caused the delay. The extra tax on share dealing because of the Taurus delay is likely to more than wipe out all the financial benefits which the Stock Exchange so pains- :tainycalculated would flow hbom Tr in the process. For custodians, meanwhile, Taurus presents both problems and opportunities. The chal- lenge is that, like the rest of the industry, they must have their systems in place and ready to run on the day that Taurus is launched - and the systems have to work. The Stock Exchange's recent focus on the ' I u pro , and its promise that Tauus wfl not be launched until the authori- ties are convinced they have PNadica11d All posiable teialb- cl hitches hn m the system Is therefore comfortig.

We'e mt aem ein GOtlMM darvess\" The opportunities for custo- dians spring in part from the very cost and complexity of the Taurus project. It gives them a chance to prove their worth to investors: their ability to take on tough technological devel- opments and to cope with a project whose timetable is con- stantly being changed. That allows investment managers to keep the Taurus development at one remove, rather than tie up their own management and systems time in the develop- ment. A further opportunity will come from one of the conse- quential developments of Tau- rus: the move to rolling settle- ment in London. The time-scale for this, like that for the \"dematerialisation\" of share settlement, is still vague. A planned move to 10-day rolling settlement at the end of 1992, recently under discussion as the most likely first step, already seems hopelessly opti- mistic given the likely further delays to dematerialisation. When it finally comes, how- ever, rolling settlement will force all those involved in set- tling share transactions to streamline their operations. According to Ms Alison Renni- son, in charge of Taurus devel- opment at Barclays: \"As time- scales get shorter, it will be vital to have electronic com- munication between custodi- ans and customers.\" Custodians such as Barclays see this as further justification for their own proprietorial cus- todian systems, which act to tie clients to them through a sort of electronic umbilical cord. Other service providers have different ideas, however: Reu- ters, for instance, argues that investors will be better served in the long run by a communi- cations network that allows them to talk electronically to a wide range of intermediaries in the securities industry (not surprisingly, Reuters has its own product, Instantlink, ready to fill this need). Taurus may provide big opportunities for intermediaries in the secu- rities industry: but it could also help to break down barri- ers between different types of intermediary, or even lead to greater disintermediation.

Developments in the set- tlement infrastructure, particu- larly the arrival of Taurus, will profoundly change the market. But it is too early to say that new lenders will rush to offer their assets to the market. Custodians are an important link in the lending chain, mon- itoring loans not just for time- .liness but also for collateral margins and corporate actions such as dividends. Transac- tions are processed in much the same way as normal trad- ing activity, but there are dif- ferences. For example, a custodian has to know the shape of the avail- able certificates it holds in a particular stock before it can confirm that a loan can be made. A lending pool with 1m shares in Imperial Chemical Industries could not satisfy two loans for 500,000 shares if there were two certificates for 300,000 and one for 400,000 shares. To understand the attraction of stock lending to custodians, one has only to look at lending spreads. In the UK, they range from ft for gilts to 1.25 per cent for domestic equities. But the largest revenues can be earned from lending international securities, an area where the UK has been slow to take advantage of its prime posi- tion. As Mr Simon Thomas of Davis International Banking Consultants says: \"Much blame can be attributed to the regulators, inland revenue and government who took a long time to recognise the vital role which the UK should play.\" Mr Thomas thinks the custo- dians did their best in lobbying the Inland Revenue to amend rules which prohibited most lending of non-UK securities. Since the amendments in Janu- ary this year, lending pro- grammes have blossomed among the better organised custodians. Mr Thomas points out that although spreads are extremely attractive on inter- national loans, custodians do not keep all their share - The Bank of England: The SBLC Is monitoring margins stock movements associated with loans can be expensive. For historical reasons, lend- ing is still regarded with deep suspicion by most UK funds, in particularly the pension funds. For example, one large custo- dian which handles the assets of more than 400 funds has approval to lend securities from fewer than 10 of them. There has been resistance from some of the leading con- sulting actuaries which have advised funds trustees not to sign lending agreements. Cus- todians have found this a key obstruction to expanding their lending programmes. But other reasons are more prosaic. Many UK pension funds hold the majority of their assets in domestic blue chip stocks where the underly- ing market is most efficient and the demand for lending is least frantic. Lending involves the classic risk/return trade-off of any transaction - given that only a small percentage of a fund's assets will be on loan at any one time, the returns on a lending programme for custody clients are not necessarily worth the extra risks involved. In a physical market there are both costs and risks associated with the movement of paper securities. For custodians attached to a fund management house such as Robert Fleming or Mercury Asset Management, lending has to take place in a context where the investment deci- sions of the fund managers are more important than the chance to make a nice spread on a loan. Such a house would look foolish if an investment choice was frustrated or negated because the necessary securities were out on loan. This partly explains why the insurance companies have tended to take the lead in lend- ing their assets. They have the advantage that their funds are not monitored by trustee boards. They also tend to have more diverse assets available for lending. That has allowed operators such as Prudential Portfolio Managers to run active lending programmes. PPM does its own UK custody, so can reap maxi- mum benefit from its lending activity. It lends gilts through Midland Bank which is its Cen- tral Gilts Office settlement bank. Otherwise, it runs its own UK equities lending using Venus software developed by Premier Systems. It is still a matter of conjec- ture as to the effect of Taurus, the book-entry electronic set- tlement system due to start next year, on UK lending activ- ity. If the gilts market proves a model, lending volumes should increase, particularly once the market moves to rolling settle- ment and delivery versus pay- ment. In a more controlled environment, risks are more easily quantifiable, so pension funds should feel less inhib- ited. At the same time, lending margins will inevitably be squeezed by the likely excess of supply. This issue is being moni- tored closely by the Stock Bor- rowing and Lending Commit- tee at the Bank of England, a relatively new body chaired by Mr Ian Plenderleith. SBLC believes that Taurus will change the type of lending required, with implications for the way the activity is organ- ised. That would affect the custo- dians which act as intermedi- aries. It seems likely that in such an environment only a few large funds would choose to become direct lenders, by- passing the need for the inter- mediation of money brokers. That might suit the custody community fine. But as SBLC has pointed out, if the international lend- ing market is anything to go by, direct lending has actually increased the role of intermedi- aries - there has been much greater demand for stock, allowing brokers and finders of stock to play a vital role.

   "text_content" : "Attitude toward the us. of a Olobal Custodian Consder Ir dopriate Not considering 66.0% rTnty use 15.4% Actively 4.6% Souce: PhUll and Draw Managers now prefer using a series of smaller operators THE drive to diversify institutional holdings outside national borders has fueled the demand for the services of global custodians. But now, even those fund managers who are committed to further diver- sification are questioning the structure of their custodial arrangements and asking whether they would be better served by a series of smaller custodians in local markets rather than in a single custo- dian world-wide. \"We're moving our custodi- anships back to local from global,\" said Mr Michael Payne, senior director in charge of investments at Legal and General, one of the UK's largest insurance companies. And while Legal and General has pared back the number of custodians it now uses around the world, the fund manager would never take the risk of using a single custodian for all its needs. Phillips and Drew Fund 'Custodians are moving away from their traditional role to become more of an information service' Management, which recently completed a survey of the atti- tudes of fund managers, found that only 20 per cent of respon- dents either used, or were actively considering using, the services of a global custodian. The survey questionnaire was sent to 800 of the largest UK pension funds, 40 per cent of whom responded. \"The responses on this subject sug- gest that in the short term the best growth has probably already been seen.\" Mr Markus Ruetimann, the director of client marketing for Phillips and Drew Fund Man- agement said that part of the limited appetite for global cus- todial services may reflect a shift in institutions expecta- tions. \"Custodians are moving away from their traditional role to become more of an information service,\" Mr Rueti- mann said. In addition to simple custo- dial services, clients want information on such things as whether profits can be repatri- ated - and how - and details of settlement risks. These information services become particularly critical for those institutions that are eager to invest in the so-called emerging markets - markets where the rules of the game are still fluid. Also, he said, \"we would expect the custodian to evalu- ate whether the fund manager has a correct view of the region's prospects and to act as a second opinion for clients on a variety of investment mat- ters\". For its own funds, Phillips and Drew has opted to use 24 sub-custodians rather than rely on a single global custodian for its services. The use of several subcusto- dians, he said, insures that investors do not become too reliant on one custodian and allows it to achieve more com- petitive pricing. Of course, the use of a series of custodians does create some administrative problems, par- ticularly the need to interface with the computers of a wide number of actors. However, Mr Ruetimann said that if institutions ever do obtain access to the Swift set- tlements system - something which banks are eager to see that they do not - the use of sub-custodians could become much more simple. Meanwhile, equities analysts believe that the drive towards diversification across national borders - which has fueled the growth in global custodian- ships - is not over, although grnwth mayv not nrncrad nas quickly as it has in recent years. Mr Michael Howell, director of European equities research at Salomon Brothers' London offices, said: \"Currently, 5 to 7 per cent of world equities are held outside their home coun- tries. You could expect to see that go to 10 to 12 per cent over the next 10 years,\" Mr Howell said that about 15 per cent of UK fund managers' holdings are non-domestic - a level which is likely to remain roughly constant. However, a number of fund managers are begining to take the view that the inclusion of sterling in the European Mone- tary System has so reduced the currency risks of investing in Europe that European equities may be considered inter- changeable with those of the UK. To that end, there may well be a further move into Euro- pean markets, and with it an increased demand for the ser- vices of global custodians. \"Europe looks increasingly like a domestic investment,\" he said, although he expects it to be at least five years before UK fund managers are actually prepared to make that leap. Mr Payne said that his com- pany is considering precisely that sort of investment approach. However, there are still significant difficulties associated with it, including the limited ability to trade international securities from London. SEAQ International, while offering a trading sys- 'Further diversification into international equities is likely outside Europe' tem, deals with volume too thin to be completely effective, he said. Meanwhile, further diversifi- cation into international equi- ties is likely outside Europe, Mr Howells said. US investors, for instance, who now have only roughly four per cent of their equities holdings outside the country, could double that over the next five years. However, he believes it unlikely that non-domestic equities will be as significant a part of the US investment scene as they are in the UK. Portfolios only need to hold international securities to the extent that domestic econo- mies are fueled by imports in order to offer returns that stay abreast of inflation. In the US, imports only account for 7 to 8 per cent of gross national product, unlike the 15 per cent level achieved in the UK. Norma Cohen",

   "text_content" : "THE growth of international securities lending has been a parallel feature of the expan- sion of cross-border investment in securities during the late 1980s. The ability to lend stocks has allowed not only the devel- opment of a whole range of trading and hedging strategies by market participants, but has also helped to disguise the widespread inefficiencies and weaknesses in the world's set- tlement mechanisms. For cus- todians, cross-border lending has become an important source of revenue. Lending, which started a century ago when brokers were hampered by slow, paper- based settlement systems, was formally recognised by the Group of Thirty in 1989 as an activity which, of itself, helps to expedite efficient settlement by allowing the closure of bar- gains to over-ride the lack of stock for delivery. In fact, the majority of lend- ing activity today is not under- taken to cover trades which would otherwise fail. Rather, stock borrowing has become an investment strategy in its own right, as international bro- kers and a range of specialist intermediaries seek out stock in order to provide sophisti- cated hedges for their trading activities. Whereas lending was origi- nally a purely domestic prac- tice, it began to take on an international dimension as investment funds diversified their portfolios. Funds involved as lenders still have to negotiate their way through a complex web of international law and accounting practice in order to protect themselves from risk. By virtue of its position at the centre of international time-zones and because of the large cross-border assets which are held in the UK, London has New accounting arrangements have solved the tax problem for domestic participants evolved as the leading sinan- cial centre for international stock lending. The importance of lending has been recognised by the Bank of England, which has been playing a vital role in helping to ease tax and regula- tory hurdles. The Stock Borrowing and Lending Committee at the Bank of England has been influential in improving the tax treatment of lending by overseas securities, specifically the treatment of dividends that are manufactured in that pro- cess. The lending of both gilts and UK equities has expanded over the past few years, however it is in the area of trading, and hence borrowing and lending, that London has seen the big- gest expansion since the Big Bang. A new set of accounting arrangements has solved the tax problem for domestic par- ticipants, although there is still a regulatory burden on over- seas lenders. Euroclear, the international clearing house, runs automatic lending and borrowing pro- gramhmes within its settlement processing systems. A lending function was first created in 1975, was automated in 1983 and this year was integrated into the general processing of securities settlement. The aver- age daily lending volume in Euroclear has never breached its extraordinary peak level of $3bn in 1987, but it has grown steadily to $2.6bn. Relatively few institutions have become direct lenders of their own cross-border assets, but those that did initially found it a struggle to protect their interests - so much so that in 1989 a group of 10 insti- tutions formed the Interna- tional Stock Lenders Associa- tion to represent their inter- ests. Other interest groups already had influence, but lenders were not speaking with a common voice. ISLA has since become an influential lobby. Most lenders choose to authorise their global custo- dian to lend on their behalf. As safe-keepers of the underlying assets, custodians play a vital role in the lending and borrow- ing business, although they do not actually initiate transac- tions, but merely respond to demand. For custodians, lending has become an important element of client service, although a large proportion of their cus- tomers retain an ingrained sus- picion of the risks that are involved in the markets and decide to participate on a lim- ited basis or not at all. Lending is a particularly attractive business in interna- tional markets because the margins tend to be signifi- cantly higher than those avail- able in domestic markets. For example, the explosion of Japanese Euro-convertibles and warrants in the 1980s led to arbitrage-related demand for borrowing of the underlying Japanese equities. Lending margins have fallen back as more stock has become avail- able for lending, but are still generous at more than 2 per cent. Manufacturers Hanover, cur- rently merging with Chemical Bank, has been lending directly to the broker/dealer community since 1986, when 90 per cent of its outstanding loans were in yen-denominated equities. That figure has since fallen to 35 per cent. The bank lends stock from 13 different mar- kets, with an average transac- tion size of $1.5m and duration of eight weeks. That clearly In the long run, it is possible that custodians will gradually be cut out of the lending chain suggests the stock is borrowed for reasons other than covering failed trades. The inclusion of lending within the portfolio of custody services is logical enough, given that it requires process- ing and monitoring like any other type of securities trans- action. Custodians take a generous cut of the revenue earned from lending, often taking 50 per cent despite the limited costs they incur. In the long run, however, it is possible that custodians will gradually be cut out of the lending chain. As intermedi- aries, they are vulnerable to changes in customer behaviour as well as to the arrival of spe- cialist providers of lending ser- vices which may be prepared to accept lower returns. As the business has grown, so custodians have searched for ways to broaden their par- ticipation. For example, Bar- clays Bank recently announced the creation of a strategic alli- ance with Cater Allen, via its Sheppards money-broking sub- sidiary. Barclays thought that to act as principal in the interna- tional lending market would compromise existing regula- tion for UK clearing banks, especially in the difficult area of the capital weighting requirements on lending trans- actions (the Bank of England regards such deals as involving a cash advance secured by equities, requiring a 100 per cent risk weighting which means a heavy cost to the bank's balance sheet). For Sheppards, the attrac- tion was access to a large pool of lendable securities, but also the opportunity to expand its customer base. Andrew Freeman",

   "text_content" : "GLOBAL custody is big business. The 20 largest banks have more than US$900bn of assets under custody, and that does not include either Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) or Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), which steadfastly refuse to publish any asset data. Even excluding these banks and allowing for the adjustments that the banks make to swell their total asset figures, this $900bn is heavily concentrated in the hands of the 10 largest banks. The largest global custodian, Chase Manhattan Bank, has more than $126bn in global custody assets from 217 institutional clients and an additional $9bn in unit trust assets. The theory had it that the size and experience of the largest US banks would keep all but the largest Swiss and Japanese banks out of the business. It now seems that this was an over-simplification. In the US, a number of the smaller banks have managed not just to survive but thrive in competition with Chase, State Street, Banker Trust and Citibank. The Chicago-based Northern Trust Company has shown that a small bank can often be nimbler than its New York rivals. By concentrating its resources on the needs of the US pension fund sector and by emphasising the quality of its relationships managers, the bank has grown its global business from $5.3bn at the end of 1986 to more than $26bn in 1991. Brown Brothers Harriman in Boston has also successfully developed a niche strategy, by focusing on the international mutual fund sector. In Europe and Asia, the large US banks have made dramatic strides, but there are signs that the future of global custody in these regions may not be dictated from New York. While it is true that Barclays Bank or ABN-Amro is unlikely to challenge the dominance of Chase or State Street in the US institutional markets, it is also true that the US banks can no longer assume that they will able to take Barclays or ABN-Amro's business in the UK or the Netherlands. The rest of the world has started to catch up. Until the late 1980s, global London headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank custody was a purely US business. The European and Asian banks did provide clients with international settlement and safe-keeping services, but it was seen as an additional service used to support existing banking relationships. The key difference now, according to Mr John Gubert, head of markets developments at Midland Securities Services, is that the non-US banks have made a crucial shift in mentality: \"Awareness that custody is a product not a service is novel outside the US. It developed three years ago in the UK and has started to happen in continental Europe.\" Mr Gubert argues that, where it is seen as a service, an ancillary to fund management, stockbroking or general banking relationships, it is treated as a cost centre. \"As a result the operation tends to be reactive rather than pro-active.\" The clearest example of the difference between the product and service approaches has been the lead of the US banks in terms of innovation. Contractual settlement and income arrangements and, more recently, automated tax reclamation were all developed by the US banks. But, as Mr Gubert says, the time it takes the non-US banks to catch up with the US product innovations is becoming shorter. Midland scored an important psychological blow for the Europeans, earlier this year, when it became the first bank anywhere to launch a full 24-hour custody service. Midland, The Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank have made far more rapid progress than seemed possible in the late 1980s. In the period following the 1987 crash the UK clearing banks lost literally dozens of clients to the US banks. Since then the banks have invested The rest of the world has now started to catch up heavily in people and technology. In continental Europe, the lag behind the US is greater than in the UK. Even here there is more evidence of the value of the niche approach, with two small Swiss banks, Banque Scandinave en Suisse and Pictet et Cie, leading the way in global custody. The continental European market, the latest target for global custodians, may prove to be more difficult to penetrate than the UK. Chase, State Street, and Citibank were successful in the UK not simply because they offered a better quality product than the domestic competition. Mr Ian Blades, who as head of operations at Lombard Odier Investment Management maintains relationships with 19 global custodians, makes the point that, because they set up operational centres in the UK manned and managed by UK staff,\"they have become, in effect UK banks\". State Street and Citibank have been able to repeat the same formula in another Anglo-Saxon market, Australia. In Europe, the bulk of institutional assets are effectively controlled by domestic banks. The universal banking system means that the European banks act as fund manager, stockbroker, corporate adviser, custodian and in many cases, big shareholder to most investment institutions. It also means that custody is often provided at a low cost as part of the universal package. At the same time the potential rewards of gaining access to European institutional assets is great. Mr Bernard Dagnall, marketing manager of a unit set up to concentrate on the European market at Chase Manhattan Global Securities Services, estimates that institutional cross border assets will reach $500bn by 1994 and should be three times that figure by 2000. The problem is how to break in on the monopoly of the universal banks, especially now that some of them, such as Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank, UBS and SBC have woken up to global custody as a product in its own right. Citibank is possibly the best placed in terms of its local banking presence in Europe. It can build on the relationships it has already established with institutions as a settlement bank in the local markets. Even so, it is not uniformly strong across Europe and may draw back from competing head-to-head with its local market rivals even in cities such as Milan and Frankfurt where it has a strong presence. As Chase's Mr Dagnall explains, the way forward lies in co-operation with the local banks, by providing a global custody network under a private label arrangement. \"We are not looking to beat the European banks, but rather to work with them,\" he says.

   "text_content" : "THE marketing of global custody has reached something of an impasse. The recession has meant less money has been available for advertising and product promotion. But increased competition among providers, as well as the grow- ing sophistication of the cus- tomer base, means that mar- keting is now a key aspect of survival. The problem has been exac- erbated because leading pro- The banks have produced strategies which have led to a confused product image viders of custody have created a marketing problem for them- selves. Between them, the banks have conspired to pro- duce strategies which have led to a confused product image. The reason is simple enough; as the banks and specialist cus- todians have refined their ser- vices, so they have modified and extended the product range. Global custody can hardly be presented as a sim- ple service, but its common portrayal as an array of mod- ules around a core safe-keeping and settlement functions has led to a distinct lack of coher- ence. This is most clearly visible in the contradiction between the much-trumpeted idea of basic custody as a commodity product and the more expen- sive service image promoted by many providers, in particular those smaller participants which lack critical mass. As some of the fringe banks have tried to extend their pres- ence, so it has become obvious that the business faces a period of over-capacity during which there will be fierce pressure on prices and margins. To some extent, the confu- sion has been exploited by the larger operators, which have done little to encourage a tighter definition of custody and its related services. Thus, for example, one leading US banks describes itself as the largest bank lender of interna- One solution to the problem is to segment marketing towards different customer bases tional securities, a claim which is dubious, but difficult to dis- prove. However, another US bank wants to be known as the largest securities lender in the world, mainly on the back of its large domestic lending pro- gramme. The confusion goes deeper, however, and can become dam- aging when it undermines the marketing culture within a bank. Among the largest pro- viders of custody and adminis- tration services, there is a clear tension between the ser- vice orientation and the provi- sion of a commodity-style prod- uct. That tension can easily corrode a bank's credibility among customers and potential customers. One solution to the problem is to segment marketing towards different customer bases. Citibank, for example, has examined the different buying behaviour of customer groups and is increasingly directing its marketing towards specific types. That might sound like an obvious strategy, but it represents a departure in the custody busi- ness, where most visible mar- keting has been based on blan- ket coverage rather than individual targets. The broker-dealer commu- nity, for example, requires timely settlement on its large volumes of turnaround trades, but has no need for the sort of valuation and reporting ser- vices which is demanded by the investment or pension fund market. Other operators such as Mid- land Bank have tried to show that they are different from the pack by avoiding stereotypical service descriptions and trying to identify points of strength. In its case, Midland has con- centrated on less visible mar- keting and sought to capitalise on what it believes are its unique qualities as a UK clear- ing bank. In particular, it stresses that its choice of tech- nology provider was shared by the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges, a coincidence which it hopes will encourage customers to back its commit- ment to technology. It has also made a selling point of a recently introduced 24-hour service, installed at marginal extra cost to the bank but wel- comed by customers whose location means London time is inconvenient. As with all such marketing, every bank could write an equivalent list of selling points. What matters more than the list, as Citicorp has realised, is how it is applied. The tendency towards tomb- stone style trumpeting of new customers, and even existing customers, has continued. Much of the credit for this trend must go to Morgan Stan- ley which started the habit of associating custody business wins with the deal-making skills of merger and acquisi- In has come a cultured, reassuring style promoting the image of the custodian as a hand-holder tion departments. Morgan Stanley itself has moved away from the one-off image of tomb-stones to a style emphasising its customer-rela- tions. This concept reached its fruition with a campaign which included a glowing testi- monial from Henderson, a fund management customer. This was ironic, in that previous press comments by Henderson had been interpreted by the market as signals that all was not well with its service from the bank. Other banks have adapted the tomb-stone idea. Gone is the image of custody as a tech- nologically-demanding, systems-intensive product. In has come a cultured, reassur- ing style promoting the image of the custodian as a hand- holder par excellence. One successful marketing campaign was that conducted by Bankers Trust, which sought to become a significant player in custody after it pur- chased the W M Company, the leading performance measure- ment boutique for UK pension funds. Bankers has used the W M label as its point of difference, marketing a master custody service which includes perfor- mance measurement. It devel- oped a distinctive concept in the form of a pyramid of ser- vices broken down into prod- uct layers. The bank's own marketing staff report a satisfactory reac- tion to the campaign, but admit that master custody has been relatively slow to take off Bankers Trust was careful to design its product specifically for the UK market in the UK and Europe. Bankers was careful to design its prod- uct specifically for the UK mar- ket, in the well-founded belief that it would otherwise encounter prejudice from trust- ees who might see it as another US import. The strategy involved a care- ful distinction between the Globemaster product and the independence of the W M per- formance measurement ser- vice. For example, no Bankers' staff sit on the W M board. Globemaster is presented as a product which happens to include W M's services should the customer require them. Andrew Freeman",

   "article_dc_title" : "Mainframes under Threat",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "THERE are two ways to make money in finance: by trading or offering services to people who trade. People who trade are said to be driven by greed and fear. Those who now offer services are driven by technol- ogy. Nowhere is this more true than in global custody where present technology is under threat from workstations which promise equal reliabil- ity, lower purchase prices, lower software maintenance costs and greater flexibility. Workstations also threaten custodians themselves for they may eventually allow investors to by-pass custodians alto- gether. Said to be attended by scores of technical acolytes, big com- puter mainframes were designed explicitly for the tasks of global custodians: stor- ing, updating and presenting collections of. data gathered from all over the world. Useful configurations for custodians cost more than $lm and store 100 gigabytes. IBM's AS400, the industry standard, is a mid-sized computer and not a mainframe, as many sug- gest. Now, it can be replaced by workstations, each of which can have 20 gigabytes and cost around $50,000. \"You certainly do not need an IBM midframe to do what most global custodians must do,\" says Mr Robert Kay a for- mer Morgan Stanley and Gold- man Sachs custody expert who now heads Global Securities Consulting Services. \"The new workstations will suffice.\" Workstations are powerful, desktop computers designed for collaborative tasks. Many different people, often in differ- ent locations, can work on the same task. Sun Microsystems offers off-the-shelf workstat- ions that range from an enhanced personal computer with 200 megabytes to a mini- midframe with 20 gigabytes. But hidden in the IBM/Sun comparison is IBM's propri- etary operating software requiring regular fees. Sun architecture is open to any- one's programs but the pro- grams have to be purchased and installed. \"Our strength is that we can take heteroge- neous software and present it as homogeneous,\" says a Sun spokesman. Mainframes and midframes are designed to store and move huge amounts of data. Work- stations have incredible pro- cessing power often approach- ing that of mainframes, but the circuitry or number of paths on which information moves are more limited. \"If you will imagine data as people, think of transporting 500 people on one train or 10 buses,\" suggests Mr Enno Becker, a Boston-based com- puter consultant. \"A train has efficient, large-scale hauling power, but buses are more flex- ible in that they can go places in ways a train cannot.\" Mr Becker suggests that if a broad summary to a rich degree of detail what is required of workstat- ions is defined as \"mission crit- ical,\" - and this applies to global custody - they should not presently be larger than 2 to 4 gigabytes. \"When you have important customer expo- sure, you pine for the security of a bigger machine,\" he says. Custody banks prefer IBM AS400s for several reasons. They are familiar with the technology; they are willing to pay for the continuous support that IBM provides; the big machines are reliable; and cus- tomers and clients trust ven- dors who use IBM. \"I don't think hardware or the technical environment that backs it up is the issue,\" says Mr Michael Hardy, the man- ager of information delivery product development for Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's largest global custodian. he says. \"The important issue is soft- ware,\" says Mr Hardy. The expense and loss of opportu- nity global custodians face comes from the inflexible soft- ware used in the big machines. What takes two weeks to pro- gram on the older machines, can be done in two days on workstations. Chase's solution is to use both. This strategy offers the flexibility of dismantling a large, centralised system leav- ing only those functions, such as corporate actions, or portfo- lio performance measurement that make sense from a cen- tralised point of view. \"We are keeping the midframes for the \\tasks they do best - large scale relational databases and number crunching - and apportioning other tasks to workstations,\" says Mr Hardy. Mr Andrew Singleton, a New York-based computer consul- tant argues that the more suc- cessful your product, the more people fine-tune it.\" Workstat- ions are ideal for making these adjustments. Such adjustments are being carried out by Mr Hardy for Chase. He is \"porting\" that is recasting programs used on the AS400 (Chase Infosystems has two, one is a back-uip) for work- stations. He can then put them back on the midframe AS400s, so that the big machines' soft- ware becomes more accessible and as easy to use for their specialised tasks as that of the workstations. He says that business archi- tecture goes before systems architecture. \"We used to be were bound by our systems. Now we can make them respond to serve us.\" Mr Hardy says, adding that workstations unbundle tasks that used to be lumped together on a single, large computer. Because tasks can now be separated - and dealt with separately by separate people or firms and their results rein- tegrated using workstations - a vision of a world without global custodians, in their pres- ent role, is beginning to emerge. Large customers might carry out their own custody or at least large parts of it. \"If you accept Mr Salvatori's vision of a standard world infrastruc- ture for clearance and settle- ments, taking from it what one needs for portfolio tracking, there is clearly a potential for effectively excluding global custodians as they presently conduct their business,\" Mr Kay of Global Securities Con- sulting Services suggests. This does not mean that global custodians might disap- pear. It simply means that the present single service they now provide might be unbundled, with each part farmed out to different service providers to be reunited in an overall report. If custody services now cost some 20 basis points on a $5bn portfolio, each basis point saved is $500,000. If workstat- ions could increase efficiency by three basis points, $1.5m could be saved. \"In the brave now world of the future, the successful global custodians will integrate the results of lowest cost ser- vice providers,\" says Chase's Mr Hardy, \"which is, more or less, what we try to do now.\" Workstations should help global custodians to do it more efficiently.

   "text_content" : "\"BIG fish eat little fish,\" says a 15th century Dutch proverb. If a corollary is \"Little fish eat minnows,\" it describes aptly the impact of the proposed merger of Bank of America and Security Pacific on their respective global custody operations. The proposed $4.5bn pur- chase of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific with $80bn in assets by its San Francisco rival Bank of America with assets of $110bn is a good example of an in-market merger. Two banks, competing in the same geographic market area combine their assets to create better economies of scale to improve earnings and return on equity. Expected to be approved in four to six months, the merger will create the second largest commercial bank in the US, second only to Citibank which has assets of $217bn. The merger, which was announced on 13 August, was designed by Mr Robert Smith and Mr Richard Rosenberg, the chief executives of Sec Pac and BofA respectively. The aim of the alliance was to solidify a combined banking hold on the populous west coast of the US, to strengthen Sec Pac's loan loss reserve and bolster BofA's earnings in the long run, pro- viding Mr Rosenberg a plat- form from which he can even- tually launch his well-advertised national and global ambitions. Employees are prevented by US securities law from suggest- ing what synergies mergers might bring until they are completed. But for global custodians, this is a non-event. BofA has some $102bn in domestic assets, $13bn in global assets which include UK domestic securities held by its well-run London branch compared. Sec Pac's strengths are $300bn domestic and some $8bn in global assests. Synergies could emerge when the respective services are combined. One is the strength of Sec Pac's domestic clearing operation. Its compe- tent New York office has made it one of three clearing banks that control most of the US broker/dealer business. The others are Manufacturers Han- operatons ot meir Damr are relaively sman over (soon to be known as Chemical Bank) and Bank of New York with Marine Mid- land as a distant fourth. Sec Pac has transported this expertise to Tokyo where it is carries out a good business clearing Japanese securities for US firms. The distinctions between international and domestic clearing are becoming more and more blurred. As the two merge into one seamless global custody business, Sec Pac's domestic position may gain global importance. A second possible synergy is BofA's 45 foreign offices which, over time, could be converted to create a proprietary global network, although present expense versus availability of funds suggests that this will not be happening in the near future. The $lbn that this merger is expected to gain will be used to strengthen Sec Pac's loan loss reserves. From a US domestic point of view, Sec Pac is by far the more knowledgeable and experienced operator. It has built a big securities lending business in part, competitors complain, by offering an 80 per cent/20 per cent profit split in favour of the customer instead of the usual 60 per cent/40 per cent. Globally, the nod goes to BofA which, many in the industry believe, will be run- ning the new shop. First, the two banks must consolidate their operations, a task which is fraught with risks which almost no one inside the merger will discuss and no one outside the merger will discuss for attribution. But, because a good deal more consolidation in the custody business is expected, describ- ing these risks provides useful lessons for everyone. \"The hardest selling point in custody is the conversion to a new system,\" said one sales- person Clients know that con- version means headaches, costs and opportunity losses and that they are, in short, potential disasters. Five years ago, global cus- tody salesmen could tell clients that there would be no head- aches. Now, however, people know better. \"Funds managers do not lose their jobs staying with mediocre custodians,\" says the salesperson \"but if a switch create problems, bosses appear with axes looking for heads to chop.\" However, there are ways to sell around that. Costs incurred by the bidding institu- tion are covered by the win- ning bid; no loss of trading opportunities is promised; and a conversion team will be available to hold the client's hand. The problem with selling the custody services of a bank that is going through a merger is that a smart manager will think: \"If I have to convert once now, and my assets are converted again to a merged system a year from now, you are not going to send me a team the second time. You are going to convert everybody at once and I will be just another person in line.\" Thus, there is a low probabil- ity of winning significant accounts during a consolida- tion of custodians. \"However you go about it, accept that nobody has the perfect system, so do it fast,\" says the sales- person. \"The best way to bring in new business is get it over with fast, letting your present clients know exactly what is going to happen and making it as painless as possible for them. Its like removing surgi- cal tape - just rip it off,\" he says. Another problem is that dur- ing a consolidation of custodi- ans, employees feel as if they are walking through a mine- field blindfolded. \"I watched people in the Bank of New York/Irving merger get pro- moted and fired three weeks later,\" says a relationship man- ager. \"That is how weird things can get.\" The co-operation that one reads about is only taking place at the top. Change is inevitable in the process of a merger, and forced change aggravates and even infuriates clients. \"If I were a client using one of the two banks in a merger, my first reaction would be go out to bid (solicit proposals from new custodians),\" says the salesperson. Fearing a forced change in which they do not have the purchasing power which is available in bidding situations, clients may see a merger as an opportunity in which to change custodians without receiving undue criticism from management. This is especially true in global custody where the two custodians see the merger as an opportunity to upgrade their systems. If BofA and Sec Pac can cre- ate an upgraded service that moves more closely towards a melding of domestic and off- shore services without losing clients, they will have taken a big step forward. If they cannot then their profits pictures / could start to look less healthy. Their efforts may offer useful lessons for some of their larger competitors. Desmond MacRae",

   "text_content" : "IN 1988 the outlook for the Royal Bank of Scotland's global custody operation was grim. It was faced with an expensive paper jam, which according to one of the bank's clients, took more than two years to sort out. The bank's client list had become the US global custodian's favourite hunting ground. Morale was, by all accounts, extremely low. Three years later the trans- formation is remarkable. The bank's custody operations have been completely reorganised and the haemorrhage of clients has been stopped. RBS has $37bn in global custody accounts placing it eighth in the league table of custodians. The global custody operation grew out of the merger in 1985 of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which had specialised in the business of Edinburgh and Glasgow insurance companies and investment houses, and Williams and Glyn's which had traditionally serviced the Lon- don institutions. Despite the losses in the late 1980s, RBS inherited and still has a formidable client list and a total of Â£80bn of assets in custody. Among its 600 clients are three of the top five UK pension funds and five of the top 10 UK insurers. The bank also inherited an incoherent approach to the securities processing business. Global custody, registrar ser- vices, unit trust administration and corporate trustee were split into separate centres, each with its own management and systems. When, at the end of 1989 the bank instituted an internal review of its involvement in securities services, some senior members of the global custody team were worried that the bank might pull out of the international business alto- gether. The report to the board of the bank in May 1990 con- cluded, however, that RBS should stay In the business and develop it further. The board also allocated what Mr Terry Pearson, senior developments manager, describes as \"a sub- stantial sum\" for systems and staff investment. The bank hired KPMG Peat Marwick to report on the best way to implement the board's decision and, on the basis of the consultant's findings, a new securities services divi- sion was orndred on June 1, 1981, under the directorship of Mr Alt Moon The ecurit services group pan tolhe the ount e.Tl ite a a(BIed sitrcture. a of the fit r me has been the UPR~v-r Aconf managers are now all drawn from experienced operations staff to ensure that they have a thorough knowledge of the business and problem solving. The bank's systems capabil- ity, which is based on the secu- rities and cash management systems, RoyStock and Roy- Line, still lags behind the best of the US custodians. In partic- ular, the reporting functions are weak, and do not offer the levels of customisation avail- able in some US systems. According to Mr Pearson, RBS is on the verge of announ- cing which vendor will be awarded the contract to build a new core processing system. The aim of the new system is to upgrade the reporting capa- bilities to levels required by US pension fund market. But given the problems that have dogged system development at many of RBS's competitors, the June 1992 deadline that the bank has set for implementa- tion may be optimistic. Nevertheless, RBS is now in a strong position in the UK. The winning of a Â£2.2bn global master custody mandate from Strathclyde Regional Council pension fund is a benchmark of the bank's development. The mandate was significant both because of its sise , and nature,the first master custody mandate in the UK. It was also won in the face of US competition. Mr Pearson is confident that far from having to fear US competition, the US competition should fear RBS: \"We can take them head on. We feel that we have the peo- ple and the systems to do it.\" Steven Goldman",
