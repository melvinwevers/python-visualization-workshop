I These are intended to be on such a scale that full4ime working can be resumed by the diminished labour force after November 4. Short-time on the scale proposed will involve nearly half the group's labour force of 112,000-and a-statement last night from Mr. M. A. Bellhouse, speaking for the Pressed Steel-Fisher subsidiary, warned that this organisa- tion may soon have to announce cuts on its own account. It seems clear, then, that the redundancies must be on a substantial scale. BMC ist preparing ior a long term cut in production. \"Short- time working only would not produce the econooies con- sistent with efficient. manage- ment,\" said a companylspokes- man last night. An ofictl statenient exiained: \"1In normal circumstanc~ it is the policy of the Corporfom to ensure the greatest continiy of employment dompaible wih the general prosperity of the bininess, and to'avoid wide fluctuatioits in its labour stregth.

Sir Ghnorem rdid the deciuinn had Sir Gordisildtbe dcisin ha naturally caused great disappoint- ment, though it was the only pqs- sible one to take. The Corporation would do everything possible to inifmtise hardship-\" though in present circumstances, our freedom of action is inevitably limited.\" BMC will work out the redund- ancies on the \"last in, first out\" principle. This is the first time in 10 years that the Corporation has had to declare redundancies, and the first time since the 1960-61 fall in sales that widespread short-time has been necessary. While all car models are affected to a greater or lesser eXtent, the impact is likely to be lightest at the .ports car plant-the old MGO works at Abijngon--since 85 per cent as siorts car output 'is ex- ported.. posed .y the cut it pro4uctlon, every effort wdould'be madi t mAsntain or expand axport sales. Mr. Guater was told' of the BMC decisions on Monday and imme- dately went to see the Prime Minis- ter. He put the facts before Mr. Wilson in a 20-minute meeting. The Ministry of Labour is to organis special measures to help those involved to find work.",

Canpac also announced a substantial Canada-wide rise in commuter fares. Freight rates will go up 10 per cent. from October 10 on all rail- way traffic moving. under so-called competitive rates and agreed charges. This will affect approxi- mately 30 per cent of freight traffic handled by the two systems. Canpac commuter rates will in- crease from 5 to 15 cents per ticket, depending on distance travelled. MONTREAL, Sept 13. The joint announcement of the two railways blamed increasing costs for the higher freight rates, with Canpac being blunter in it- announcement about commuter fares. It said: \"They (the rate increases) are the result of wa-g increases awarded to rail workers on September 1, when Parliament ended the seven-day strike by employees.\" Canpac's general passenger tramfi manager, Mr. Ian Warren, commented that as soon as rail workers were awarded an 18 per cent. average increase, \"we started looking around as to where we could get. money to pay for it\"",

Levet, said to-day that hearings by a three-judge panel had been tentatively fixed for next Wednesday to decide whether the merger of the Penn- sylvania and NewYork Central rail- roads into America's largest rail net- work should take place as planned on October 1. The two railroads requested the Interstate Commerce Commission at the beginning of last month to permit no further delay on the merger, which has twice been postponed to reach its present deadline after originally being set by the Commission to take effect from June 1. Since the railroads sub. mitted their requests, however, at least six competing lines have insti. tuted Court actions contesting the legaliy of the merger and it is to simplify these proceedings that arrangements have now been made for next week's hearings at which Judge Levet ruled all railroads opposed to merger will have to com- bine their Jawsuits.",

And Kennedy Round success is a matter of highest importance to the continued economic strength of the free world.\" In defence of his contention that failure of the talks would lead to distortion and inefficiency,, Mr. Fowler draws attention to the economies of Communist countries \" where the abolition of competi- tion in all its creative forms has worked a miserable result.\" It can happen to the free world, he maintains: \"The immense benefits of market competition can be lost just as easily without doctrine as with it.\" Mr. Fowler's article-\" Expan- sion and interdependence: How can we step up the pace? -pin- points several areas in which miembers of the Organisation- for Economic Co-operation and Development can work together \"to hasten the prospects of a sound, strongly growing and inter dependentfee world economy.\" Apart from success in the tariif talks, he calls for the creation or better capital markets in Europa and other advanced- countries. \"Hopefully, these capital markets would. approach the freEdom, lexibility. variety of options for 'the use of funds, and vfrlety of institutions for their placement, that exist in the U.S.\" Predictably, he also discusses the need for an early decision to create supplementary international re- serve assets to ensure an adequate increase in world monetary re- serves in the future. \"As our balance of payments moves into equilibrium, the U.S. will no longer supply the rest of the world with large annual additions to re- serve holdings. Without an alternate source for growth in world reserves, the pace of the world's future economic growth could be endangered.\" There is also an oblique criti. cism of such countries as France and Italy which have substantial reserves: \"One of the long-term solutions to the world payments problems lies in placing payments surpluses back into circulation. .Increased assistance to developing nations by countries with balance of payments surpluses would help solve .te, obtepn.\",",

The anti-infla- tionary programme unveiled last week by Finance Minister, Mr. Mitchell Sharp, in the Commons came under attack at an unofficial Liberal Conference held in Peter- borough, Ontario last week-end. Ontario Liberal leader. Mr. Andrew Thompson, spoke out bitterly against the Government's decision to set back one year to July 1, 1968, the effective date of its Medicare programme. He was -- - r - OTTAWA, Sept. 13. critical of the Cabinet for not dis- cussin this decision at a Federal Libr caucus before announcing it in the Commons. Other Liberals at the Peterborough conference spoke out in support of Thompson's criticism. Signing the telegram demanding the caucus were Mr. John Munro, Parliamentary Secretary to the Citizenship and Immigration Minister; Gerard Pelle tier, left-wing Liberal from Quebec; Donald MacDonald, Parliamentary Secretary to External Affairs Minis- ter; and Pierre Trudcau.

The first six months of he financial year are traditionally etter then the second six months Id sales ost are seldom recovered. The conom~c situation and nrdit res tions besn to have a erious impact on our trading from August onwards and substantial ncreases in such items as eneral ates, national insurance, wage md salaries agravated the already high cost of operating in he London area. Interest chages lue to the greater number of new vehicles held by us on a consign- nent basis in sacordance with the 'stocking\" commitment common to the trade were very greatly in- creased. The burden of finaicing his consignment stock will be ipparnt, for the Group balance beet shows that at March, 1966 no les than Â£1.064,127 was committed ia thm ' form compaed with \"455$54 at Marchl 1965. Shareholders were advised when the interim dividend of 10 per cent was :anounedd that under normal circumstances the Directors would have considered a reduction in the amount of the interim dividend, but felt that shareholders should be given the fullest possible advan- tage of the transitional provisions of the Finance Act, 1965. The pressure on profit margins con- tinues, and taking into account all present circumstances and the short-term prospects, the Directors very much egret that they cannot recommend the payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31st March, 1966 on the Ordinary Stock units. The participating dividend of 1 per cent. due dn the Pre- ference Shares will be paid on the 30th September, 1966 as already announced, In order to reduce .the Group's operating costsi steps have been taken to integrate more closely the trading of our subsidiaries. To this end the service and parts sales activities of the branch of Eustace Watkins Limited previously carried out at Chelsea Manor Street have been transferred to the. newly formed Group Service Division at Acton. Our trading results for the first quarter of the. financial year 1966/67 were more favourable than for the correspondinga quar- ter of 1965/66. Nevertheless, with the new Selective Employment Tax, which on the basis of existing staff will cost the Group approximately Â£75,000 per annum, and with the further deflationary measures just announced by the Government, it is quite impossible at this early stage to forecast the results for the current year. Despite immediate uncertainties the Directors are confident that with a lessening of the present economic tension and an improve- ment in credit facilities the Group will achieve its full share of the expansion which undoubtedly lies ahead of the motor industry both at home and on the continent. The report was adopted.",

' Group profits of Â£110814 before non-recurring expenditure of 2.113, taxation and loan stock nterest are comparable with Â£63,970 for the previous 12 months. Aircraft Firnishin Limited: The compay's succs in design- ing, manufacturing and supplying Secoonom\" class seats for the VC 10, Bong 707, DC 8 and DC 9 aircraft'of several important airlines, has led to a considerable increase in, demand from all over the world. Turnover was up from Â£348,275 in 1965 to Â£384,847 in 1966, and for 1966/7 projected and budgeted turnover for which orders are to hand, is in excess of Â£500000., Orders are already in hand in respect of 1967/8 and 1968-9. The general assessment is that the number of air passengers will double by 1972 and treble by 1976. The demand for seats appears assured and we wish to retain what we regard as the preeminent posi- tion in the United Kingdom aircraft seating industry. To facilitate in- crease in production, larger pre- mises have ben taken on ease on the Hersham Trading Estate. But for labour availability, consider- ably greater turnover could be achieved. The Boari is giving con- sideration to the establishment of a satellite factory in Northern Ireland to manufacture sub- assemblies, this being the only apparent means of obviating the frustration accompanying the neces- sity to decline substantial export orders for lack of labour avail- ability. Divntry Engineering Co. Ltd.: The Peneral demand for the com- pany s products is high and con- tinues to expand both in volume and number of customers served. During the year under review, the company operated from two sac- tories, one in Oxford Street, Daventry, now compulsorily acquired from our landlords for development and partly from 15,000 sq. ft. of our own freehold premises in Long Buckby, some five miles distant. The 10A acre site at Long Buckley has now had added some 30,000 sq. ft. of production ,:space. The move to the new fact0try'will be completed shortly. C pside- able economies ate expdted from the integration. Metals & Alloys (Birminghanm) Ltd.: Very considerable technical and financial progress was made during the last 12 months. The company continues to expand ih both the powder and -casting divisions and new associated pro- ducts'for which there is an assured market should add to,profitabilty in the future. The volume of bus- ness from the heavy electrical in- dustry was Increased during the year by the development and intro. duction of special techniques for the casting of components i chromium copper for Centrl Electricity Oenerating .Board switchgear. The range of casting siz has been expanded by the in- troduction of a 72\" diameter cast- Ing machine and the company now has the most comprehensive rang of centrifugal casting capacty, In terms of stis and alloys Utilistid in the United Kingdom DeIand contlnues at a high level for -etab llhed materials and protbts for the current year augur well.

But the OECD experts argue that businss investment is determined by other factors beside the growth of aggregate demand and that, in any case, there are now signs that com- panies are more aware of the need to maintain a steady level of invest- ment irrespective of temporary fluctuations in economic activity.",

LPE-Morrison is affiliated with the London Press Exchange and Publicidad Continen- tal is a subsidiary of the Austrian- German Intercontinental. The Americans, with their good nose for business possibilities, have set up such joint ventures as Ruescas- MeCann-Eriekson, Alas-J. Walter Thompson, Rasgo-Grey, Publinsa- Kenyon and Eckhardt and many others. These competing companies -sad the Central Publicity Board's stern eye-are at last lifting morale. Discounts on space and time granted by advertising media, for which reimbursement should, in theory, be passed on to the adver- tiser, are less frequently pocketed by the agency. With some 120 dailies and over 30 special Monday issues published in about 65 Spanish cities and towns, the Press is still the most heavily used medium and takes over 30 per cent. of total publicity expenditure. The total circulation of dailies is estimated at about 5.5m. This is equivalent to some 170 per 1,000 inhabitants, against close to 500 in the U.K. The big Madrid and Barcelona dailies- such as ABC, Vanguardia and YA -have a circulation of about 200vi0 w dom each' roula of more than 70,000.

There are about 2m. TV sets an use, y*th the number growing fast. TV time is sold directly by the net- work or by spacebrokers such as Telesistema or Publidis. As advert- ising is limited to six minutes per hour, space in the prime hours is paid at a premium, with prices for a 15-second spot ranging from Ptas. 25,000 to Ptas. 95,000 (about Â£570) and reductions granted for long-term contracts. About 25 per cent. of total ad. vertising expenditure is booked by the some 290 privately owned tadio stations which blast away day and night. These aim their publicity mainly at housewives, and prices range from Ptas. 100 to Ptas. 700 (about Â£4 3s 6d) for a 15-second spot. The Cia Espaflola de Publicidad is handling advertising in Madrid subway stations at Ptas. 125 per square metre a month, with a mini- mum usage of 100 square metres. Billboards too are used increas- ingly along Spanish highways at a cost of Ptas. 2,000 to Ptas. 6,000 a month for a 10 by 12 feet display. Under a law enacted last year, bill- boards have to be set back 60 metres from the road, but this is not always enforced. Cinema attendance has fallen from 295m. in 1961 to 210m. last year but the 7,750 cinemas in Spain still book about 10 per cent. of advertising expenditure, mainly be- cause, of the high quality short films made by such companies as Estudios Moro and Movierecord. A film of up to 14 metres costs from Ptas. 12,000 to Ptas. 30,000 for the first copy, and the cost of showing runs from Ptas. 400 per week in the provinces to Ptas. 2,000 in a Madrid cinema. Following the 1964 tax reform, a 2.7 per cent. turnover tax on all billings must be paid by the agencies and is, in most cases, passed on to the client.",

Biggest Success SMouton Cadet is indeed the only French table wine brand to have established itself widely in Britain, although the other wines mentioned above are sold here. But the biggest success in recent years has been Mateus Rold from Portugal. Just as the' recipe for a successful English novel once upon a time was said to include romance, well- born characters apd a cricket match, so Mateus has clearly incorporated the basic popular ingredients: it is pink, it is fizy, it is slightly sweet, and it comes in a very pretty bottle. The number of its imitators is the best tribute to its success. The oldest popular brand name is, of course, Llebfrau- milch, a name associated with blended Rhine wines long be- fore the less enclosed orders of the Roman church came out to wrestle over it with Rhine maidens and other worldly and nether-worldly characters. To- day Liebfraumilch, to some 'a haven of liquid safety in a shift- ing wine list world and to othets' a dirty word, is certainly the biggest blended wine name here in Britain. Among the latest to offer a German brand wine are Gran .of %Jrl p u.vi put on the,'Arkl t a Moselle-and a Hock ,dr ,the label of Goldener .Cober.. There must hive been\" itroni temptation in the Grant Boardroom to call the hock a Libfraumikh ,trom' whose cellars in linpn on the Rhine the wine comes. But to their credit thy obviously de- cided that the were. eough Liebfraumilch brands already, and thedo same went for Mosel- SbImcue and Met elgold. The Jao 4. not too ichb and altloulh I found the oselle a bit lacking in acidity and firm- ness for my taste both are good value for 12s lOd a bottle, as they now are after the last duty rise. Fuddy-duddies Perhaps some brand pro- mo.trs n their enthusiasm for such standardised wines are a shade hard on others. A news- letter just put out by one London agent has a side-kick at some of the'few remaining old fuddy-duddies who obstinately stick .to non-branded wines. \".Venerable 'ldi gentlemen in musty London clubs are shak- ing their heads in sorrow at the passing of the good old days when an Englishman worth his sort drank- nothing but Chiteaux bottled wines.\" Poor old clubmen, always assigned to their dotage, with their sense of smell and taste ruined by the mustiness of their surroundings, and heads per- petualy shaking like pendu- lumsa But how far from the truth, for in fact in Britain neither in clubs nor elsewhere have chAteau-bottled clarets even been in much demand. The trade her in claret has always been and remains overwhelm- ingly one of wine shipped from Bordeaux in cask, and bottled, usually with considerable skill, by merchants in. Lodon, Bristol, Liverpool, Leith and other centres of the trade. There are . surely sufficient charges of clubmen-type snob- bery against wine drinkers with- out not very accurate attacks from within. In fact chAteau names were most uncommon in the \"good old, days,\" which might be carbon-dated as prior to 1848 when there were all those upsets in Europe, to the delight of that uiaclubbable old non-branded Moselle drinker, Karl Marx. Until about 100 years ago most claret was either sold under a generic label such as Mddoc or St. Julie, or under a merchant's name. One bought \"Barnes's Black Seal Claret or \"Wilson and Cutlet's Red Seal.\" These in fact were brand wines, but confined to the individual merchant. The problent that present-day brand wine promoters have to lace in Britain are the high prices that result from the rela- tively high cost of importing cheap wines into Britain. As demonstrated in an article in this column earlier this year, it costs not far short of 6s now to place a bottle of imported water onto a wine merchant's shelf, The price problem becomes more acute with branded wines, for in order to secure wide dis- tribution, the retail price has to include a built-in discount to the retailer; usually about 20 per cent. And there may well be promotional expenses .too. In France the brands do not have to face any duties imposing a high floor level on all wine prices. To see this one only has to compare the prices of the basic Nicolas wines in France apd in England, where on each litre bottle there is a duty element of around 4s 6d.. Not Cheap That is why the well-estab- lished brand wines, including Mouton Cadet, Mateus Ros6 and the various Liebfraumilch brands, while reliable and con- sistent, are not exactly cheap. It is also the reason why the Burgundian and Bordelais- houses have not had much suc-. cess so far in exporting their brand wines into Britain. It is both understandable and good buying policy to rely on a brand name when one is not too fami- liar with a product; and the established branded table wine. shippers deserve their success. But those with rather more knowledge, confidence and access to a regular wine mer- chant can probably do better at less cost to themselves. And this goes for those left-over \"'bin-ends.\" the venerable club- men, too.",

First, the left-wing of the Baath Party now in power is provincial in outlook by contemporary Arab standards.

If Leonardo wanted to engage in a scientific dialogue, there weren't many men he-could turn to. Today, by contrast, he'would find ninety per cent of all the scientists known to history alive and working. For this is an unparalleled time of scientific challenge. Much of this ciallenge is met by an entirely new kind of industry- the science/aerospace industry. Within North American Aviation alone, there are more than 16,000 engineers and scientists dedicated to exploring every frontier of science. These people, and thousands of others like them in other companies, represent an unprecedented scientific and management talent-a true natural resource. A resource that can solve a wide range of human prob- lems throughout the world. The efforts of advanced-thinking organisations like North American Aviation-plus their unexcelled abil- ity to translate ideas into reality-are already shaping a better future. Here are some ways North American is putting science to work: TRANSPORTATION--a study to help the state of California solve its trans- portation problems for the next 50 years has been developed using com- puter technology and the systems analysis approach. FOOD-an experimental- pilot plant indicates that some 50 tons of usable algae, which can be used to feed chickens, can be grown annually per surface acre of water. And the photo- synthesis process involved would help purify m'lions of gallons of water for agricultural and industrial re-use. WATER-developing an advanced. dual-purpose nuclear reactor to pro- duce fresh water from the sea, as well as economical electric power. MDICALLABORATORY-designing a portable Field Medical Laboratory that will have 200 major items of advanced medical equipment and could be used anywhere.in the world. ELECTRIC POWE-pioneering the technology for an advanced fast breeder nuclear reactor that could produce more fuel than it consumes and provide economical electricity. PROPUsioNIN-producing the rocket engines that launch many of America's major space vehicles, and developing'moreadvancedpropulsion systems for future use. HALTH A MEDICINE-developed a miniaturised heart monitor; tiny microphone for. asthma research; brainwave-monitoring equipment requiring no needles or hair-shaving. FE SCIENCES-one of America's largest life sciences groups pursues projects ranging from experiments for NASA's Biosatellite Programme to surgical monitoring devices and artificial heart and kidney work. WASTE MANAGEMNT-- studies of problems of sanitation, water sduply, and air purification fors 'sac~ travel promise to yield valuable information to help solve similar problems in major Imetropolita aress. FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE -one of the few corporate laboratories in Amer- ica devoted entirely to fundamental science provides a stimulus that can lead to the new products, processes, and industries of tomorrow. INDUSTRAL TECHNOLOGY-advanced manufacturing techniques are fur- nishing industry with a wealth of new knowledge in many fields, including metallurgy, welding and materials processing. OCEAN SYSTEMS -developing a two- man submersible workboat with manipulators for undersea mning, drilling, and rdscue work; designing other deep stubmergence systems for work and research. ELECTRONICS- set standards'of relia- bility for the electronics aid.wtry with. microelectronics systems far more reliable, lighter, and imaller. than previous systems. AVIATON-built more than 10,000jet aircraft, and a vital contributor to the development of tomorrow's high- speed, high-altitude military and commercial flight. DEFENCE-contributing to the defence of the Free World by producing advanced electronics systems, super- sonic aircraft, missile propulsion sys- tems, and many other military items. SPACE EXPLORATION-buiding the Apollo spacecraft to carry three U.S. astronauts to the moon and back. SAnd this only begins to tell how North American Aviation and the science/aerospace industry is putting science to work for mankind.

By contrast, Ford is still offcially confident of maintaining full-time working (though without overtime) \"'indefinitely. As these sharply contrasting an- nouncements show, the depression in sales is having its usual effect in hitting the run-of-the-mill models much harder than the select few (including BMC's own 1100 range) with an especially strong appeal. Special Factors Apart from this, however, BMC has been hit -by a number of special factors:- 1-Unlike its competitors, the company has no important new models to announce in the near future. Ford, Vauxhall, Rootes and Standard-Triumph are build- ing up stocks of models not yet announced, and preparing for the good initial .sales such models usuall enjoy. 2-Light van sales have dropped by nearly a quarter in the last year. BMC dominates this market, and there has been increased competi- tion, especially from Ford. 3-The depression in the large car market has bit BMC particu- larly hard-it had a sizeable stake in this market, unlike Rootes and Triumph, but no new models to match Ford and Vauxhall 4-The sales of the'smallest cars -up to I litre-have also been falling back, though the Mini range has to some extent been supported by improved export ales. ,:I' .

There have blen tech- nial problems; bad omponent suppus; and the Minetactor, .launAch against ther trend to arger. machlais, has Iot been a sucoess. plies all the group's tyre and the suspensions for the frontwbeel 4rive models is especially vulnerable, though some relaxation on.e tyre side may be welcome-the compny has for some time found it difficlt to supply the demands of the replace ment market, which s far more. profit able than the sale of tyres to car manufacturers. Lucas, the Birfield group, Automo tive Products and many hundreds of smaller companies will also be affected by cuts by BMC or almost any other manufacturer -though many will be protected to soamei tent by their very healthy export'busIn in car components. The. first union consensus of opinion, as distinct from statementi y individual union officers, came ast night from the Amalgamate4 Engineering Union. After a meti ing of the Birmingham District Committee Mr. Colin Jonps, Bir* mingham East secretary, represent, ing all BMC workers, apart from. those at Longbridge, said: \".W feel BMC is exaggeirting the effects of the economic situation, Employers seem to'us to.be using it to attack wages, and condltions in the motor industry. \"We will not accept redun- dancy as a measure for dealing with this situation, and wd shall pursue vigorously a policy of work- sharing.\" 1967 Outlook Mr. Harry Urwin, Midlands secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, whichdhas the largest membership among car workers, said: \"We shall actively oppose any redundancy until we are satisfied there is no other way of handling the problem.\" It would not be sensible, he sad, to break up eficient labour forces and then find that men had to, be recalled. The effect of the Government's measures has not so far been as dramatic as the announcements from the companies would suggest. Industry estimates show that so far sales are running much as ex. pected-only slightly below the level for the same period last year -despite the drastic fall in hire purchase contracts reported for August. But as the statement from Standard-Triumph indicates, the real fear is for the longer-term effects of the squeeze, The outlook for early 1967 looks gloomy. The relatively low level of sales at present simply bears out the experience of recent years, when the drop towards the qnd of the year has become progresuively steeper.",

GORDON TETHER ONE CAN SEE that major c~' tries with extensive internatignal banker commitments or otl~er t' portant international obligtionl.. find the idea of devalati9nbo re- pugnant that they are prep to go to almnost any lengt! th avoid it. What s 1s easy to understand is why sma icounities with no such .embarrasuments to worry abott are also inclined to regard the preservation of their existing currency values as pretty well a matter of life and death-this even when it becomes evident that a modest adjustment in their parities ould greatly help tbem to over. come prssing economic troubles without provoking any really far- teaching external or internal reper- cudonPs. Indian Example One example of this almost unl- versal. inability of: th com maercially less ifortant countries to et- the idea of parity adjust- ment into proper perspective has been provided in recent years by India' prolonged insistence upon. cligin.to parity that had long. been quite unrlaitic although It was vidnt that, by complicating te probem of mobilsing ade- quate foreign aid and by seriously mpeding th growth of exports, this Was greatly hampering the Government's efforts to resolve the grav balance of t ayments problem. Another is to be found in the wy in which the Finnish authoriies have reacted to. the sug- gestion that a minor adjustment in the iliie of their currency to, rettedy the loss of pdrchasing power it has suffered at the hands of inflation would provide a fairly easy and reliable means of escape from the economic problem the country has been grappling with for the past couple of years. When questioned last month on the' approach of the new Finnish Government to economic issues, its Financt Minister, Mr. Koivisto. de- clared that it was \"self-evideht\" that the Finnmark would not be devalued-not even if any country with which Finland was closely connected should reduce the value of itscurrency. .The implication is that the new Administration, like the !od one, sees the case for mkih- taining the currency at Its present level so irresistible that. it, wobld'nt evert contemplat o chadging the paryshould therbe becurrn lignments elsewhere-an Mr. Koivisto was, of course, thinking in terpts oa apossible pu In the value of the. :;,\"79 , . . -* ,- , ,,, Couutriis with currencies whick, like the PinUmark, .are -Aledy, showing a tendency to 'beome er-valued would, of course, run a considerable risk of gravely pre- Jldiiit~ their balaqe of payments iture by not responding to a te- uctipp of any substance in the value of a currency playing as im- portant a part as the Â£ does, both dirqtly nd indisctly, in Finland's 6raw.4tjJyniil.^So: it ii quite abs F FoWgges' thi the preserva- ion of the Finnmark's existing arity could be taken for granted ai those circumstances. But Fin& and, like other Scandinavian couh- ries, has been caused so much touble by the backwash of the 's diiculties that it is perhaps under- standable that the Finnish authori- ies should be anxious to maintain that the Finamark has \"no coi- ection with any other firm \" how. ever improbable that may sound. '.hat it i less easy to: compre- hend is why they sho.uld have aurned dobn-seemngly almost without cosidering it- tloecase for-' a modest unilateral devaluati~q of the Finamark, seeing that this :oild provide them with a much ss painful' way than they are taking at present of resolving the balance of payments crisis that has been giving them so much cause for concern since the end of 1964. External Reserves In the period since the balance of payments began to swing into deficit, Finland's external reserves have suffeted a drop of between a third and a half-which means that they are now at their lowest level since the 1950's. This set- back is partly attributable, it has to be admitted, to a piece of bad luck-the sharp fall in the inflow of foreign capital for supporting development activity caused by the tightening up of world capital markets. But it is also due in significant degree to the fact that the decline in the real value of the Finnmark produced by infla, tionary trends has acted as a stimulus to imports and at the same time impeded the growth of exports. The Finnish authorities have been making considerable efforts to restore the balance of payments to health for somb tim6 past. And, tater a decidedly disappointing start, these now appear to be bear- ing fruit. Thus, in the first six months of this, year, eXports we a couple of per pent. higher than in the corresponding period last. yeir, wlitileas imports showed a similar decline. But.the pace of th, recovery is tilj too slow for comfort. What is more, a substan- i 'prie\"s haviti to' bpaid for it ls other directions. In particular ,ih.,,paorous crna s. ques and other restraints imposed on eco- nomic activity at home in the interests of getting imports down are forcing the country to accept a much slower rate of economic expansion than it has been accus- tomed to and generating many other kinds of stresses. Then again, if-as seems likely -present policies do no more than contain external payments pres- sures generated by the decline in purchasing power the Finnmark has suffered during the past few years, it is not going to be easy to relax them when the external position has been stabilised with- out running the risk of re-creating the problem they have only just managed to. resolveq In these circumntancer there would surely-be a-good deal to be said for, giving serious considera- tion to the possibility of establish- Ing the currency at a rather lower ,4evel in order to provide the basis for a more enduring recovery in the country's balance of payments position and one that would be much less dependent on the con- tinuance of restraints on economic growth. It is the chse, after all, that prices in Finland of home- produced goods have risen to a very materially greater extent than those of the general run of other countries in recent years. So there is a good reason for thinking that a devaluation would operate as a brake of substance on imports and give much-needed- encouragement to exports. A Painless Operation In view of the fact that Fin- land's. currency hardly enters at all into international commercial and financial activity, such a realignment would not create the kind of complications it would for other larger countries. Nor, see- ing that the Finprhark has suffered some erosion of purchasing power in relation to other currencies, would the change cause serious embarrassient to the country's main trading pattners. \" Naturally, the resulting advance in the prices of imported goods would exert an upward pressure on the cost of living. But this might be a small price to pay for the benefits that could flow from the change in other .directions. Finland, like other small coun- tries with balance of payments problems rooted in a tendency for .their currepeies to become over- valued, should not resist the idea of devaluation as though it were the plague, The IMF rules are expressly designed to make the modest realignment a relatively painless 6peration. It should not ' bmade *.point of hondur not to take advantage of them.",

   "text_content" : "THE NEW defensive arrange- ments between central banks announced yesterday have been under discussion for some months past, since before the sterling crisis of the early summer. They have been prompted by the unsettl~ state of financial markets, particu- larly the sharp rise in inter- national interest rates, and they will increase the scope of the world's monetary authorities for offsetting the movement -of private funds across the ex- changes. The Bank of England has increased its swap facilities with a number of unnamed central banks to an unnamed extent. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has increased the total size of its swap network from S2,800m. to $4,500m., a third of which represents an increase in the Anglo-U.S. swap from S750m. to $1,350m.: France is not in- cluded in the latter arrangement and presumably not in the former. The U.S. swap network is not subject to strict conditions, like the arrangements made to support sterling in September, 1965, and June, 1966, but allows its members full freedom to draw as they see fit if the need arises. Cushion for sterling Although the new scheme is not specifically designed to help the pound, it will certainly do it no harm. Confidence in sterling has been so badly shaken over the past couple of years and dollars have become so scarce and dear that the exchange rate is still far from buoyant. Over- seas observers, though mostly convinced that the Government has now deflated sufficiently and that the balance of payments will begin to move into surplus by the middle of 1967, still prefer to wait and see. The underlying trend of the trade balance will, in fact, be concealed for some time yet by the effects of the seamen's strike and by anticipation of the abolition of the surcharge. The August figures cannot be wel- comed more than half-heartedly, despite the sharp drop in the deficit, because imports have re- mained at an extremely high level and export-jpartcularly export to:Europe--have not yet recovered enough to make good the shortfall of Juie and July. The increase in the size of the international swap network may, however, serve as a useful re- minder of the resources now available to cushion the e.- change rate against any future movements of short-term funds. Apart from our own reserve, our remaining dollar securities and our unused drawing rights on the International Monetary Fund, we have access to three separate facilities-the S1,050m. still remaining of the uncondi- tional U.S. swap, the unknown amount .still remaining of .the special U.S. swap, and the un- known amount of the June arrangement with European cen- tral banks to offset any drop in sterling balances. On top of this, there are'. swap arrangements with France and some other countries and the remainder of a S250m. line of credit with the Ex-Im Bank. The Prime Minister is plainly not the only person determined to see sterling held at $2.80. Network of swaps ,The latest step forward in international monetary co- operation should, however, be looked at from a more general view. Sterling is the weakest of the leading currencies at the moment and the most sensitive to strains in the financial mar- kets. But this could change, and other currencies might need pro- tection against te disruptive effect of capital movements, par- ticularly as the year-end approaches. Agreement on re- form of the international monetary system is undoubtedly nearer, but it has not yet been reached. In the meantime, the swap arrangements sponsored by the U.S. four years ago, and which have since played an in- valuable part in maintaining stability, are being extended further by mutual agreement to meet a situation of' common concern.",

Ysterday Electrolux became the second. In fact, it is surpris- ing that Electrolux has delayed solong in following the leader- Hoover has about 53 to 54 per cent. of the floor-care market, while the Electrolux share has fallen marginally from nearly 30 per cent. to between 27 and 28 per cent. over the last fourteen months. Redundant Workers Electrolux, therefore, is hoping to re.timulate sales-perhaps suffciently to be able to reinstate the 150 or so workers declared redundant last week at Luton. Certainly the market needs a shot in the arm. In common with other domestic appliances-as our graphs illustrate-vacuum cleaners have entered the doldrums. Trade deliveries in the first quarter of this year averaged 134,200 machines per month at a total value for the quarter of about Â£4.6m. This compares with 145,100 machines a month and a total value of Â£5m. for the same period, of last year. In the second quarter, average monthly deliveries had fallen to 92,100 (from 144,800) and the value was less than Â£4m. as against above 45i. For the time being, however, Electrolux plans to maintain prims n its other products, thou it itso longer in a strong positio act dealers who t ake special offers oh these Indeed, it is generally considered in the industry that this second recruit to the ranks of freed prices is \" the beginning of the end of resale price maintenance, for domestic appliances\"-the words are those of Mr. Raymond Berry, manag- ing director of Berry's Electric, but the opinion is echoed by many others-even at Hotpoint where the decision is to keep fixed prices. Electrolux stresses that its de- cision was based on the \"point- lessness of holding prices when so many cleaners were on offer at free prices \" (meanin Hoover brands). The same contention could be applied to washing ' machines in which. Hoover has a 36 to 37 per cent. share of all types, and some two-fifths of the market in automatic machines which are now gaining popularity. Indeed, Hoover's Keymatic is often to be found priced at from around 85 to 90 guineas (and the Consumer's Association reports sales at 80 guineas), which strikes hard at other brands of similar.\"' machines retaling .at from 105 guineas upwards. reed, on her, ideed, it now loolu Â«'most Mtird metingsf British Electrical and Allmd Manufac. tuWrsrsAssocatlÃ½o, 'Jathougb no full-membership nor special meeting haa ever ibee called on the issue. Indeed, the Associa- tion plans no action until after the report of the registrar of the Restrictive Practices Court, ex- Pect*e within the next month or so, but recognises that individual members may Well take inde- pendent lines of policy. Many have long felt their case for exemption from fixed prices to be weak. But, in the end, the fear of losing dealers' favour has won the day and prices have been. maintaind even by those who admit this policy to be little more than a facade. Become a Farce The facade has been crumb. ling fast lately. Indeed, fixed prices have become something of a farce .as one sales incentive follows another in the fight for supremacy in dwindling markets. Electricity Boards generally in- vite old appliance trade-ins for -new ones, offering generous terms. Some manufacturers have given away free laundry baskets, kettles .and ather gits. baskets, kettles and ther ifts.e Others have promoted bargain or discount weeks, and most makers regularly supply equip. meat for resale through dis- count\" associations such as trade unions and the like. In mact, it has been variously reckoned that \"more n than 40 per cent.\" and \"getting on for 50 de cent.\" of people pay shae long less than tcs fixed mptie for the larger domestic appliances. In iarallel with the changing view of manufacturers has been that of retailers. Initially, ani. mosity towards Hoover ran high and orders fell. Then, as sales eased on all sectors, many dealers found Hoover a suffiaently fast- moving brand to nweaen their loyalties to price fixers. Indeed a large number of retailers may give priority to freeprice mer- chandise now that they have learned to trade with them. A garoi\"- and-'.Cutlzribl sis vite customlers lIn tadein tfey buy omething else once they are inside. SNormal Delivery On the whole, however, they do tend to buy the bargais. A John Lewis sokesman said yes, aerday that \"there has been good acceleration in Hoover ales and that prices were still about 20 per cent. off the recommended prices. Our volume has ade. quately tompensated for the lower cmar up. The only pitfall to beware o s not Increasing selling costs. Customers get nor. nmal,delivery and guarantee semr pjg as before, but they must ex. VioNm a beoren, but they must exÂ· yect to pay fair service costs once the machine is out of guarantee or if they want anything out of the way.\" At multiples like Curry's and J. and M. Stone, as well as some stores, reports follow a similar -attern. The London Electricity Board, after admitting to initial doubts, .now claims to be \" pleaied with the business done in this brand in spite of the fact that we have not cut its prices. But, then, we have been able to show that our credit terms and - service guarantees compensate for our often higher prices. On the whole, free prices seem to be a good thing.\" Extended Ranges Primarily, it is the large units that will benefit from pnce free. dom, just as they have fared Â» worst in the last year.' Smaller appliances have been doing well, although competition. has become fierce as one company after another enters the field or extends its range and the. over. all rewards now have to be spread more thinly. Electric irons are selling better because of a growing demand for solid- plate types as well as steam irons -or even in addition to them. Sales fok the first-half of this \" year are nearly 10 per cent. up. Electric blankets more than doubled their sales in thd winter months of 1966, although they still have far to go to approach the 1963 record of 2.2m.-last year's total was 1.4m. There has also been an en. couraging demand for other pro. ducts which had slow beginnings such as coffee-makers, whose ales' went up by 80 per cent. during 1965 and look like main. taining that performance this year. Toasters are going well, as are food-mixers, table-top A frypans and the like. Sales of aishwashers, too, are picking up. Off-beat Products Last year these werg under 22,000 (excluding the Swan. maid), but the first half of this year accounted for nearly 13,000 machines as compared with 9,780 in the previods year. Other, more 6ff-beat, products have also k' improved their positions. Hair dryers and heated hair curlers have been marketed by a grow. ing number of companies and are selling well. Electric can. 'openers-: a~d\"' knife-sharpeners are, like electric carving knives, items for which only limited demand was expected but most of their distributors claim to have been \"pleasantly sur. prised\" by how well they are being received. The likelihood of an intensive price war may well slow down orders and sales for the next few weeks as everybody waits to see who goes next, which is why some are anxious to take the plunge as soon as possible. One manufacturer put it that \"free prices are undoubtedly a sales weapon. Whether you hurt your opponent with it or get wounded yourself is strictly up to you.\" 'B tu fu .m th tit th R Pc sM fe w be",

I should have thought building societies would have found it worth their while to cater for re- ired people by offering the 4% per cent. rate on all large deposits of say above Â£2,000. For, clearly, one large deposit is more service- able than a large number of small ones, provided, it is kept above the agreed amount for say at least one year.

The undrlyin trend thus reains \"obscure.' \"Too Gloomy\" However, Mr. Douglas Jay, President of the Board of Trade, clearly takes a favodrable view, at least of the prospects for exports. He stated yesterday: \"The record export figure for August shows that we are rapidly tnking good the losses caused by-the ihipping strike. aid suggests, that the deductions drawn from the figutie for recent months were too loomy.;\" He went on: \"We cannot count on every month's exports being as good as this. But the trade balance is recovering front the strike, and is doing so before the Govern- ment's . uly measures have had time 'to encourage.still greater ex- port efforts., Firms which- cannot pow sell enough at home should try even harder to sell more abroad.\" A three-mpnthly comparisop ge , that som\"e ground should still b, made up ,i exports in the inexl oth u tt or tW. q, spite if the Auigust, .Outtur . tnmonthly vrage for the prd froa Junei \"'stl4,. o, t98.. agains 4.,.

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour CormDonldent THE ODVE BEN'rS detii sion to hold up the Clyde ship- yard productivity agreement for six months because of the pay freeze means the disruption of a scheme for ending demarca, tion disputes in the shipyards. Although the union involved, the Boilermakers Amalgama. *ion, isastill waiting to receive official noification of the Gov- ernment's decision that the pact must be shelved, its president, Mr. Danny McGarvey, has Iready stated-that the men may steike if the agreement is. not implemented immediately. The pact covers 3500 metal- working craftsmen who are em- ployed in the upper reaches of the Clyde-in yards such as those of John Brown and Co. (Clydebank), Alexander Stephen and Sods, Yarrow and C, and Charles Connell and Co. They are jealous of the 1.800 Boiler- makers' members employed in the lower reaches of the Clyde who have benefited from a simi- lar productivity pact since last -utumn. Uniform pay The reason why the men on the upper Clyde have fallen behind their colleagues em- ployed at the mouth of the river s that. for many years, the, em- ployers and unions have had a closer relationship on the lower Clyde. There has also been a fairly uniform system of pay- ment for shipyard workers in the lower reaches, whereas higher up the river the various yards have different systems of payment he Clyde Shipbuilders' Association has been impressed by the way that the shipyard workers in the, lower reaches have gone a long way towards the elimination of restrictive practices during the past year. it is anxious that the agreement should be implemented as soon as possible in all Clyde ship. yards, particularly because it takes Mr. McGarvey's talk of strike action seriously. The essence of the agreement is that a metal-working crafts- man should no longer be con- ined to working at his own particular trade, but should be allowed to do other types of work which impinge on it. The intention is not to open all the trades to every member of the -oilermakers, but to prevent the waste of labour that occurs when a man has to stand around idle, waiting to do some trifling task because it is his own particular preserve. The shortage of craftsmen in the .industry in recent years has given the men a sense of job security, so that they are no- ready to b many of the old restrlctf6as by which they protected their jobs. It is oubtful whether the men would have been so co-operative if the employes 'had not iuasranteed thatnobody would lose his job because of the introduction of the new working practices. For example, in exchange for increasqd pay, they are pre- pared to allow a man to do the work of a caulker (who makea seaps wtertglbt) and a burnMr Wtr o bitW!Mflf excess material from plates and beams), where i the past the caulker and the burehr would never allw each other to cross the rigif demarcation barrier between them. The areement takes account of the fact Pat prefabrication in the assembling of ships makes nonsense of the old craft demarcation barriers. In the past, the shipwright was respon- sible for erecting the skeleton of the ship. while the plater was involved m erecting the plates which put the skvi of the ship on the bones. Now, however, there is so much sub-assembly of a ship in large units before the final assembly on the slipway. that the jobs of the shipwright and the plater overlap. The Clyde -areement allows shipwrights and platers to merge as one trade. The pact also allows for platers and shipwrights to do tack welding and service burn- ing on their own jobs. Until now they have had to wait for a welder to do the tacking and a burner to burn off the excess metal. In exchange for the meu agreeing to relax a number of demarcation restrictions of this sort. the employers are offering a bonus of Is an hour. to be paid in three stages. The first 4d an hour is to be paid when all sections n a' particular et accept the agreement; wit A further 4d u soon as'the dea is operated, and a finl Wd e the whole agreement i fuUly operational. In the upper reaches of tW Clyde the wage rates diffr in various yards, but a typical rate at present would be 10s 6d aa hour for welders, who are among the higher paid, and 8s 8d an hour for caulkers who are among the lower paid. Each yard is making separate arrangement to intro. duce the agreement. When the pay freeze began on July 20, only one yard in the upper reaches of the Clyde, Connells, had started to operate it Connelll made up the bonus for its employees to 8d an hour from August 8. But since then the other employers have post. poned implementing the pact, while waiting to hear from Mr. Ray Gunter, Minister of Labour, as to whether the pay freeze applies to it When Mr. Gunter discussed the agreement last month with representatives of the union and the employers, he said that he regarded it as one of the best productivity pacts that had been' brought to his notice. And he told the two sides that he would not take the responsibility alone for ruling that it must be post- poned for six months. However, Mr. Michael Stewart, Minister for Economic Affairs. takes the view that there can be no exception to the pay freeze because, if the Government allowed even one agreement to be implemented during the next few months. unions in other industries would insist that their own pro. ductivity pacts should be implemented. And it now appears that Mr. Gunter has accepted Mr. Stewart's point of view.- scot,",

Gallenkamp Traditionally the profits of A. GaqeaLamp rise smartly following publication of its q quennal catalogue.

Shareholders, however, lose the extra 2 points of interim dividend to Goveroment wishes with the final cut by the same amount to 10 per cent. making an unchanged 15 per cent for the -year. A proposed oie-for-three scrip issue is some compensation. and Galleikamp with earnings of 38 per cent. certainly has scope.for a usefully higher payment when conditions allow. Meanwhile the 4.4 per cent. yield and 8.8 P/E ratio at 17s 3d are acceptable for two reasons. The range of scientific and - laboratory equipment manufac- tured by Gallenkamp find a ready market at home-schools and hospitals - and overseas, which takes between a quarter and a third of total sales. The other point is that long-term growth prospect tied to an Pxpandins social services programme look bright for a company which is strongly entrenched in its field. Cambridge Instrument Despiti the general outlook Canmbride lMtiment, manufac- turer of scientific instruments. still seems to be making good progress. The essential point is that the com- plete reorganisation of the group's activities is starting to bear fruit. Margins especially are showing the benefit, for against an.

Taking a fairly conservative view, there seems to be a sp'ting chance of a pre-tax total of about Â£600.000 against Â£499.000 last year. This would cov~r a maintain4.d22 per cent. dividend aound I times after a full tax charge and it is doubtful whether the dividend freeze is relevant at this stage.

But the hort-term outlook at home remains -bscure- In the circumstances the yield of 6.9 per cent. with the shares at 1s 6d seems fair enough.

According to these officials, negotiations on the increase have been in progres for some six months. There had been earlier discussions on increases in several of the swap arrangements and this had been bzroadened into a discussion of the general expansion of virtually the entire system. 'Mr. Charles Coonibei. the vice- pr.ident in. charge of the Foreign epalrtmenatatthe ew York Federal 1;Sa, Mhis- sixioothly report on I~Sfc fgirlgn ea ange operations Pbs, : t y. dynotefs that the roadenin of crdit lines must be see against a background of market lly ;late August,\" he says, \"the sterling ad other exchange markets had seated own to reasonably well- balaced and orderly trading, but in Nn atmosphere of continuing anxiety.\" Ji goesO onto sa6y hoWevet, that the ew aclities are'aow at \" levels well hov l site of any routine drawings that mihtreasonly -be expected.' ,P.T sampe report reveals the extent to'-4hch - bth Britain and the U.S. have drawings outstanding under some. of the previous swap arrange. ments. ' ' .The .Fedetal Reserve, according to the report, made several drawings during Jul and August amounting to $470m. (of which $225m. was in Italian lire) chiefly in order to support the pound.. Has of thiV&as now ben rd, lv a total 23m. out standing. Market Uncertainty The general \"market uncertainty to which Mr. Coombes refers has found expression in a drain of funds across the Atlantic to the U.S. This is one reason why the outflow of reserves from London has continued after the July measures, and despite forecasts of a U.K. payments surplus in 1967. Continenta countries have also been disturbed by the upward ,o\"Iet-of business borrowing rates ad thi helps to explain why they overcall their reluctance to provide further irst aid r the dollar and the pound, Faalunease has also shown increased speculative urhases of old whh have ipqd. ot1 into prvate hoards vir. ti. *ll tier cent increase in the world's gold stocks. No resl alleviation of these financial prestres is foreseen before the end of the year President Johnson will not be able to go much furtler In tighte0n ing nical policy until )1ter the Nov. ember ongressiona elctions; and f Mer that the aPProach of December nI. whn most banks make up thleir bpMs Qsheti, will add to the strains.

On a broader front, the new arrangemnts are regarded as a practical way of mproving- world liuidity, when there s no prospect o any quick agreement on a more permanent reform. The swap agree- ments, however, amount purely to an increase in short-term credit facilities and do nothing to increase the supply of \"owned reserves,\" which is the object of the Group of Ten's longer- term work on international liquidity. The newly-extended swap arrange- ments with the New York Federal Reserve can be drawn upon auto- matically by either side. This does not necessarily apply to Britain's arrangements with other central banks and certainly not to the Basle arrange- ments of last June which can only offset movements in the sterling balances and are subject to strict multilateral surveillance.\" Domestic Demand Reviewing the vicissitudes of the pound since the end of last year, Mr. Coombes says that the British aus- terity programme \"clearly strikes at the problem of excessive domestic demand and, riven adequkte time, should prove effective.\" He concludes that by early this month \" there was evidence that the British Government's determination to defend sterling would receive broad piublic support and that the programme was already beginning to show results.\" Even before the fu effect of the current British measures is felt, he in recent months sh uld beig bot Iut o lo $s6,6tmnto\" astrong recovery t Fe The frullwr 1, t i the era Reserve's assisnceto the pound during the crisis is not revealed In the report. The only detail vouchsafed by Mr. Coombes s of atechnical opera- tion in June. when the Federal Rderve bought a total of S66.6m. of spot sterling and sold it for delivery one month forward, thus reducing the arbitrage incentive to shift fundsfrom New York, and bolstering spot sterling quotations. German View On the other hand, the increase An the swap lines between the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England was seen in Germany as evidence that the situation of starling remains serious. This was the conclusion from what is understood to have been a dispro nortionately high increase in the ritish-American arrangements when compared with the increase in swap lines that the Americans have carried through with the other central btnks.

The country is accus- Stomed to relying fairly heavily on capital imports from the Soviet Union, Western capital markets and the World Bank. Credit Shortage This year, although the volume of longterm foreign borrowing has only declined by i 6 per cent. in the first half, it has not been possible to raise a single bond issue on the open market. Finnish borrowers are turning increasingly to private credits i from foreign banks and invest- s ment houses-credits which have I the drawback of being of shorter Â» maturity and higher rates of interest. The foreign exchange reserves have been drawn on to finance the external deficit, and at th6 end of May they stood at only Frs.57m. (Â£82m.). about one- quarter less than a year before, and only equal to slibhtly less than six weeks' mports- \"which by Western European standards must be onasidered a rather low level,\" to quote the Bank of Finland. Finland is therefore bound to wish to improve its trading posi- tion. IThe current slowdown in the economy may, of course, save something on the import side, but it was oriinally triggered off by the drop in the international demand for forest products, so hopes of using spare capacity for an increase in exports must lie on the manu- facturing side. Finland is all too conscious of her dependence on the' two main export matrkets of Britain and West Oehian*; t he i *wwarwfl impry - roin ,t okiw\"laAf t 1Stio D economzic gr thio these two . countres.

She would therefore be more likely to seek some kind of trade agree- i ment, with a particular eye to a safeguarding her rapidly expand- r ing trade with the rest of Scandi- a navia, which has been increasing I at no less than 17 per cent. a .year since the formation of | EFTA.

How- ever, if the ptesent stalemate between EEC and EFTA con- tinues, it is not impossible that the proposal will be revived. I Finland has thus been having Sa year of uncertainties. The i slowdown in the economic Sgrowth rate which set in a year Sago was aggravated by the unusually cold winter, which Sbrought forestry, building and transport to a standstill in some i areas. It remains to be seen how the new Govetnment. with its ambitious social aiorm plans, will tackle the bkoblem of refloating the economy, while Sat the same time keeping the trade deficit in check and avoid- i ing an inflationary increase in the budget deficit.

As in most countries, housebuilding is essentially affected by the state of the money market, which is extremely tight at present. Finland suffers from a chronic shortage of housibg. This is, in pirt, a consequence of the war, when nearly 500,000 persons, about 13 per cent. of the popu- lation, had to be resettled in what was left of Finnlnd after the loss of :the territory which Finland had to cede to the USSR, Many of these were urban dwellers. In part, the housing shortage persists because of the almost explosive process of industriali- sation and urbanisation that the couptry is.undergoing. The rural exodus is overloading the towns, particularly the bigger ones like Helsinki, Tampere. Turku and Lahti. More Assistance The State has helped from the outset, but the report of the Housing Policy Committee in August, 1965, revealed that public assistance must be stepped up. To reach an inter- nationally accepted standard of housing in the next 10 years, Finland must build at the rate of 50,000 dwelling units annually -in the towns, most people live in flats. The target for 1966 is something over 40,000 units, for 1975 nearly. 60,000 units. Average annual construction in the 1950s was about 30,000 units, in the early 1960s some 38,000 units a year. he Committee's recom. mendations havealready been embodied in a new Housing Act, but for technical reasons the new t le1 eis ailit be imple- vissid n imiipdlfrtfitlm 1968.

   "text_content" : "By Our Ma~ti ' ' Sparkling figures for the year to June 30 are announced by Mount Ian, Australia's big lead- zinc-copper mining complex. Con* solidated net earnings hve advanced to SA16,827,250--euiva- lent to Â£6,730,900 sterling -from SA6,235,454 - or Â£2,494181--in 1964-65 when production was halted for three months by the pro- longed labour dispute. A final dividend of 6 cents makes a total of 8 cents (7.68d) against 5 cents (4.8d) for the previous year. Furthermore, he company conmier that with normal production and trading conditions a 10 cent total may be anicipated for the current year. The net group earnings are arrived at after deducting: Income tax $A6,107,560 (SAI,035,666), Income tax equalisation SA4,134,400 ($A3 742,000) and depreciation $A8,2 1,620 (sA7,467,744). No Strikes Behind these record earning lies a period of favourable metaluprces and of industrial harmony, the latter being an especially important factor in a country where miners are in high demand. Even so, the net group profit of SA16.8m. still shows up well against the $AO0.Sm. earned back in 1963-64 when Mount Isa also enjoyed an absence of labour troubles. In that year the daily ore-miing rate averaged 10,199 tons and it has since crept up to 11,000 tons. A big break-through to around 16,000 tons should come when the 10-year expansion programme 'is completed. This has just made an important move forward with the commission- ing-announced here yesterday-of both the big new concentrator and the K57 deep-level shaft.

   "text_content" : "By Our Economics Sta :ritain's gross national product rose by 6* per cent. last year to bout Â£31,000m., according to the National Income Blue Book I for 1966. This represented an income of Â£560 per head of population, a rise in real terms over 1964 of about 2% per cent., and slightly below the average rate of increase over the last 10 years. However, income from employ- ment between 1964 and 1965 rose by 7% per cent.-over 1 per ceit. higher than the 10year average. Although consumers' expendi- ture increased by 6 per cent. last year, total investment at home and abroad reached a record of more than 21 per cent of the GNP, compared with about 17 per cent. in the first half of the 1950s. Net Capital Stock For the first time estimates are given of the UJ.'s net capital stock, m which assets are valued at current replacement cost, after deductin capital consumption. The net capltal stock at the end of 1965 was around Â£75,000m., of which about onethird was held by the compay sector and about two-fith by the public sector, Gross domestic fixed investment in 1965 was 3 per cent. hisher than in the Naional uincome im e BOOKUU 1964 at constant prices, with the in. crease led by the bli sector.

   "text_content" : "by A ND REFWI ?'ORIL What a marvellously exhilarating aperience is the Kirov Sleeprin Beauty The ballet belongs t: them, was created for and by them: in 1890. Unlike Swan Lake, it was composed by Tchaikovsky and Petipa working in partnership. And the Kirov style of dancing fits it so marvellously that it might have been preserved simply to keep this ballet alive. It entered their London season last night, in a performance with several of the principals we saw ive years ago. Swan Lake is a lyric tragedy, for all the variou- forms of heroic \"happy ending\" with which it has been provided. But The Sleeping Beauty is not a drama at all, in so far as develop- ment and interplay of character are concerned; it is a banquet of dances, devised in a shapely prologue and three acts, with a narrative to provide their setting. Not a drama, but on the other hand not, we must be clear, a mere sequence of separate dances: but rather a long lyrical poem in varied metres, with carefully balanced and carefully contrasted strophes, held by a thread of radiant narrative. All this the Kirov performance realises to perfection. There is F eat feeling for the varied textures. or the mood and tone of each act, for sequence and contrast. That the dancers are not \"actors\" is here unimportant; the lyric quality of their dance carries all before it. And what glorious roles it offers. Swan Lake essentially has only two. In The Sleeping Beauty we start with the Lilac Fairy-which drew big, imperial phrasing from Fedicheva, in a performance of serene confidence. With such grandeur in this role, the Lilac Fairy certainly takes control of events. Five other fairies, all with variations, in the Prologue, and four more, variously displayed, in the third act-all delightful dancers, Nina Sachnovskaya and Ninella Kurgapkina outstanding. How beautifully, how freely, high and softly the Kirov girls jump. Then, again ih Act 3, Princess Florine and her bluebird prince Makarova and Solviev-need one say'more?.She is all delicacy, preci- sion-yet with none of the small- iress that tlm ..awnitht- nftn A,11. r. tful rhythmic *. 4relud' ,.te 'doubltots n i f h la3 .variaon. e--one of th* ,' t ashioned ,a or0 t ina generaton by God nd this case, then by the Kiov hool) to show the male body as a heart- easing, heart-eletidng instrument Sos manly grace and potry. And then, as Prlncs Aurora, a Kolpakova whose lenth of line, sureness of attitude, balon, eleva- tion, speed. control are all entrancing. Semyenov, .once again the prince, is a clean attractivp dancer, well cast in a fairly neutral role. He lacks magic, but holds t he part well and, literally, rises to his big moments. The production is nicely staged, notably with a rustic musette in Act 2 different from out treatment of the music that (whether it be by Petipa or Sergeyev) seems very convincing; and in the Act 3 entrd, more of Perrault's characters than we usually see; though not more variations. (Perrault, incidentally, becomes \"Peppo\" in Covent Garden's back-transliteration from the Cyrillic-an author to set be- side the well-known Bodler and Schelli). Red-Riding-Hood has lost Sher basket before she comes on. Virsaladze's decor has an apt . 19th-century look, and his idea of setting the whole ballet behind a Spair of gates which open to reveal Sthe tale, and close again:at the end, Sis a pleasant one. Visually the re- suit is not exactly distinguished, but it is a good deal less fussy and obtrusive than the Royal Ballet's Sdcor and costumes; and the 'Awakening makes rather a pretty picture.

   "text_content" : "by DAVID CAIRNS The audience, in this final week Of the Proms, shows no sign of falling oi~ in either size or enthusiasm. Last night's pro. gramme, played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, was devoted to 20th-century music, English and American. After a first half of Vaughan Williams and Hoist that was familiar -but still full of interest-the Tallis Fantasia and The Planets in assured and vliorous performances under Sir Malcolm Sargent-we struck out into less familiar territory and heard Gunther Schuller conduct Ives' Fourth Symphony and his own Sequences for flute and strings. Beforehand I had vaguely imagined that after the cool, pre- cile sounds and spare gestures of the Schuller (his splendid Studies on Themes of Paul Klee was played at the Pentival Hall last year) Ives' tumultuous music would seem Intolerably congested and unforme, Rut I am boaud to con. flu that whereas 1 eould not make head or tale of Sequences,\"whIch Is , the central of three movements far flute and strins (would t have b come clearer In the otext of the whole?

Gunther Schuller's programme note last night said that this \"de- veloped quite naturally out of Ives back round and childhood, durinl which he frequently heard In holday celebrations In hi home- town of Danbury, Connecticut, two or three marching bands passing In review, ll playing In different tampos and key.,\" No doubti but wht had that to do with ul, the auene ?

   "text_content" : ".S. . :FRA Sa I There can be no doubt that. a 1 purry muscal point O1 iw. a coaert reproduced on w*rLnadlo is usually superior to 'o6Jnt4 on television., A moterately good radio receiver achieves a higher degree of fidelity than the usual house- hold television set, and the auditor is never distracted by that constant fidgeting of the cameras back and forth between performers and audience-as though an unmusical companion were nudging one ? every few seconds to say \"Take a look at that one over there I\" This is not. however, to deny that from a point of view not ex- clusively musical a television con- cert can exert a potent fascination. Recently, for example, in the series broadcast from Edinburgh, the actual music performed by. the Canadian Youth Orchestra with such remarkable accuracy and self- confidence took second place in interest to the random shots of the intent faces of the players. But the field in which television can serve music best is that of close analysis-as has been per- fectly demonstrated by Antony Hopkins in his four programmes Notes on Music, the last of which was presented on Thursday (BBC-2). Mr. Hopkins is a bril- liant lecttrer: totally relaxed, in- formative, enthusiastic and without any trace of either the condescen- sion or the precosity so irritating in some of his rivals in this field. The subject last week was Bartok's 'Sonata for two pianos and percussion, and Mr. Hopkins opened with a brief resumed of the ways in which composers since Berlioz have explored the poten- tialities of percussion instruments, including, of course, the piano. A photograph of Stravinsky, seated beneath a vast array of drums-his musical batterie de cuisine as it were-was then followed by a glance at the score of the work under discussion, in order to demonstrate Bartok's astonishing meticulousness both about the tempi to be followed and about the methods by which the appro- priate sounds were to be produced. It was at this point that the medium really came into its own. In a concert hall it would have been virtually impossible to see what type of hammer was being used at any particular moment on the xylophone, what implement on the triangle, or to detect whether the drum was being struck on the centre or the extreme periphery of its skin. But each of these details was picked out by the cameras, so that though the eventual playing of a whole movement of the work was, as a purely musical exper- ience, far inferior to a hearing of the.work in a concert hall or even on records, yet no one who watched the programme with any attention could have failed to appreciate both the masterly com- plexity of this particular work or the extent of Bartok's innovating genius. Mr. Hopkins made another, far less satisfactory appearance in Late Night Line-Up (BBC-2) that same evening. It appears that he has recently bought a sports-car, of which there are only ten other models in existence. Since this was the BBC, we were not, of course, told the name of the car; nor were we told anything of importance about its design or specifications. What we were shown was Mr. Hopkins's hand (I presume that it was his) inserting his ignition-key. followed by some grainy and foggy shots of what was obviously a powerful white vehicle of inde- terminate make braking and squealing its way around Hendon airport track. This pointless exercise told us nothing about Mr. Hopkins except that music was not his only interest and nothing about the car except that it could travel fast One might as relevantly have been shown him at the switch of a new dish-washer or a new waste-disposal unit (both unnamed, of course). In fact, Late Night Line-Up manages night after nght to main- tain an astonishingly high level of interest and it must, I suppose, be excused if from time to time it is reduced to this fatuous kind of time-klllag. IHow good it can be was demonstrated in an earlier interview that same evening when Lord Montagu .was questioned about the World Folk Festival to be opened the following' day at Beauleu and about the whole Stately Homes business. That it is a business now, Lord Montagu frankly dmitted; and in doing so, deplored the attitude of those of his rivals who, while envying him and the Duke of Bedford for their success were too \"gentlemanly\" themselves to become professionals. That a property as modest as Palace House - artistically no Chatsworth. Knole or Petworth- should be at the top of this league is a tribute to the energy and busi- ness acumen which this interview so patently revealed. We could have had more than a mere 40 minutes of the World Folk Festival from Beaulieu the following night; and we could also have done with less of that sporadic raking of the cameras over what appeared to be a pre- dominantly middle-aged audience and rows of empty seats. Lord Montagu had described folk-music during the course of his interview as the \"chamber-music of jazz\"; and certainly this seemingly small but rapt gathering was little differ- ent from the kind of audience to be seen at recitals of German lieder or late Beethoven quartets. Julie Felix, presumably the star of the occasion, sounded as though she were shaking off the effects of a cold, and once again the words and music of her songs of social protest seemed too simple to carry the burden of their message with coherence and justice. The Spin- ners, however, were in splendid form-especially with a Mersey- side version of \"Frankie and Johnny\" called \"Stanley and Dora. The saddest viewing of the week was Mike and Bernie's Show (ABC. Saturday). When these two Jewish comedians appear for ten minutes as guest performers, they are likeable and amusing; but-at present at least-they lack the variety to carry off a 35-minute show of their own. Their chief sketch showed one of them in travesty-looking surprisingly like Barbara Stanwyck-being inter- viewed by the other for a job as secretary. Practically the only visual gags throughout this per- formance were for the secretary either to produce a toothy grin or to kick his/her legs in the air to reveal a pair of candy-striped drawers. The witticisms were on the level of the question: \"How good is your filing?\" being followed by some business with a nail-file. The five script-writers of this witless and wearisome show appear at present to be working with one out-of-date joke-book between them. What is obviously needed now is one script- writer-with five joke-books. And another team of comedians. T. C. Worsley is on holiday Antony Hopkins",

   "text_content" : "by CONRAD L. OSBORNE In America, these are exciting days for the arts, in somewhat the same sense that the frontier expansion days must have been exciting for architects and builders-those false-front stores and frame houses may not have been eternally memorable in design, but there were lots of them. So when we throw up several dozen multi-million-dollar \"per- forming arts centers\" in the space of a few years, and then find that they don't all work quite right and that we don't always know what in tarnation to do with them, you Europeans must exercise forbear- ance and keep in mind that there was nothing there before. It is not even a case of rebuilding what was destroyed, but of building anew what has never been. I enter all this by way of ex- planation for our use of the word festival,\" as in \" Saratona Festival of the Performing Arts, which is in its programming indistinguish- able from a fairly lightweight month of regular-season orchestral concerts. So, if a festival is the occasion for performance of works that would not ordinarily be heard, or for the gathering of performers that would not otherwise be brought together, or for a particu- larly painstaking rehearsal schedule then Saratoga is not a festival at all, In fact, of the four programmes I heard, there was not one that I, or any other critic with a choice in the matter, would have bothered to hear during the regular sym- phonic season; nor were the others listed of any greater magnetism, This does not mean that they were poor concerts-only that there was nothing unusual or \"festive\" In their conception, Nonetheless, Saratoga represents an exact doubling In the number of major orchetral summer sea- sons in America (one times two Is two); it represents the opening up of a whole new territory to music- making on the highest professional level; and it represents a highly attractive and workable new facility that will be qvallable to someone's future Imagnation and that in ddition to the onti of concerts by the Ph'ladelpha Orchestra, thre was a preceigps Sonth of bllet Iperformlanoe by o New York city B allt-n Sboth appropriate and Stoe Performing Arts Ce ear ltelt ud the rather etra ornary public epon It i thu te Ilortt iory f I seaso| rastop Is known for wo thla It mtneralwatr and it reaeln saon.

It hi is in other words, the first theatre at of its sort in this country capable he of mounting full-scale operatic and ks balletic productions, and of hous. d, ins them from season to season, ir 'The turnout this first year has be been extraordinary - audiences u- have been huge and enthusiastic, is and though the tourist trade cer. at tainly accounts for a fair propor- tion (and will, for the foreseeable 1*a future) it 'is the local response I, (includini that from the tri-city c area of Albany, Troy and Schenec- ed tady some 25 mles to the south- m west that most pleases the festival irs officials, The concerts I attended included * two abbreviated opera'in-concert.

Miss Price was in good voice, and though I don't care for her brisk, rigid handling of the Ernani piece, she sailed through it well. The text of Knoxville was only spasmodically comprehensible. but that is a tough problem with a large orchestra in a big hall. The over- tures were fine, but when the Phila- delphia Orchestra plays well in the introductions to Forza del Destino or Gazza ladra. it's hardly news. The opera evenings did serve to bring back Hilde Gueden, very nearly as good a Sophie as she was a decade ago, and an incomparable Rosalinda, the singing full of bite and a sailing freedom on top, the impersonation full of wit, sophisti- cation, and real, unforced sex. There was, again, the ine playing of the orchestra, naturally wel- come, and there was the Ludwig/ Berry team, as Octavian and Oobs In the Rosenkavaller. Miss Ludwig is certainly singing more impressively than she did when she was last at the Met; the voice Is rounder and fuller, seem- ingly more developed at both ends without a precarious weak spot In the middle. Vocally, she was per. haps the nnest Octavian I have ever heard; unfortunately, her comport- ment was insistently mannered and fussy. Her husband, who Is coining to the Met for the first time this year sang well and acted sensibly (one of those \" concert\" presentations where everyone feels called upon to \"characterise,\" but only while standing up), It was a pleasure to hear an Ochs who can really knock out the to p and F, and who avoids much of the parlando fak.

   "text_content" : "by PARE WIGAN Pollowing hlt week' St. 4-gr in which Sodi0m turned th tables on Charlonow by soum 13 lengths as compared with their rnidhin In the Oxfordshire Stakes atNewbury less than a month previously, a letter appeared in a daily sporting newspaper in which the writer stated. that he well remembered the expression of astonishment on the face of G. Todd, Sodium's trainer, following the Newbury race. And the writer went on to say that though everyone was delighted that the Manton colt's inept display at Newbury had been due to kidney trouble and to nothing more serious, and that though he realised that trainers were under no obliga- tion to divulge information to the public concerning their charges, he felt that \"Mr. Todd might have made some suitable announcement before the St. Leger.\" As far as this particular matter is concerned. I have no comment to make-other than that with a prize of Â£41,177 17s 6d at stake at Doncaster, Todd, who could have expected to receive, and no doubt has received, at least 10 per cent. of the stake money following Sodium's victory, had predious little incentive to engineer a betting coup. As for Mr. R. J. Sigtia, the owner of Sodium, the stake money, less, say, 25 per cent. paid to trainer, jockey and stable lads, plus the syndicated value of the colt when he is retired to stud, adds up to a capital sum that would relieve even a person with extravagant tastes of concern about the ability to indulge them. The letter is interesting, however, inasmuch as the sentiment it con- tains is in many ways symbolic of the present-day attitude of the public towards racing.' Indeed. judging by what one reads and hears, it is no exaggeration to say that there is a strong under-current of opinion to the effect that race- horses are, to a certain extent, public property. This view, curi- ously, does not appear to be based on the grounds that the racing public, by virtue of off-course bet- ting contribute'substantially towards the prize-money available to owners, but simply that they have an undefined prerogative to be sup- plied with information that will enable them to bet more profitably. In these days when the financial structure of racing and the entire bloodstock depends on the support of the public, it stands to reason that concessions must be made by owners and trainers, a typical and important one being the overnight declaration of runners which has meant that the punter is able to study the entries in his morning newspaper in the knowledge that all horses listed will take part unless a Veterinary certificate is produced giving an adequate reason why an animal should not do so. In addition, gallops at Newmarket, Lambourn and else- where are conducted in open fashion nowadays, and it is no longer common practice for a trainer to fire a couple of barrels from a shotgun into a bush that might conceal the presence of a \"tout\" or racing correspondent: nor is it feasible to adopt the tactics of the Druid's Lodge con* federacy who, early in the century, incarcerated stable-lads employed at their remote training establish' ment on the edge of Salisbury Plain for weeks on end in order to ensure that their plans were naq leaked to the outside world. However, though it would obvi- ously be reprehensible for, an owner or trainer deliberately to mislead the public, those who fre quent betting shops are apt to forget that it is the owner who foots the training bills and so is paying for their, as well as his or her pleasure. And this being the case it is asking a great deal of an owner to divulge to every Tom, Dick or Harry the precise extent to which an animal is fancied. Indeed, I would go further and sug- gest that nobody, unless he or she be a close friend 'of the owner% has any business to solicit informa- tion., Trainers, presumably, are under an obligation to supply the owner of a horse with' information about its prospects, but there have been occasions when a betting trainer has been a trife lax in this respect. For exampk, a lady who had horses with the late H. S. Persse for many years, told me that earl* in her association with that lovablb Irishman she had a two-year-old running for the first time, and that just after the jockey had mounted she asked the trainer whether he thought they had a chance of win- ning. \"Good God, yes \" said \"Atty,\" and when the owner approached the bookmakers with a view to having a modest bet she discovered that her horse which had been quoted at 20 to I in the morning newspapers was a firm 5 to 4 chance. If Finally, as a warning to those who betray a racing confidence, there is the story of a man who enjoyed a tilt at the bookmakers and who was told by his trainer that a horse of his had shown greatly improved form on the home gallops and stood an excellent chance of winning an important handicap for which the weights had already been published. The animal was listed at long odds in the ante-post betting, and the owner, who was of a generous nature, told two or three close friends that they ought to back it, but to do so discreetly, and on no account to divulge the source of their information. Tw# days later, just before the stable commission was to be placed, he read in a newspaper that his horse had been heavily backed with \"inspired\" money, and that in consequence the odds against it had been shortened from 33 to 1 to 10 to 1, at which price it was equal favourite. His reaction was prompt and to the point. He gave instructions for the horse to be scratched and those who had betrayed his confidence lost theig money. To-day's Selections Page 20",
