THURSDAY Evening. The reduction in Bank Rate from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent., although generally expected, was welcomed nevertheless in City quarters even if it did little to mitigate the force of the blow dealt by Sir John Simon in his Budget. Foreign exchange dealers again reported fairly large offerings of foreign currency, while bullion brokers stated that, in addition to sales of coin and bullion by British nationals, there was evidence of large offerings of bar gold by foreign interests. Prior to the Bank Rate decision business was exceedingly quiet in the discount market and, for some time afterwards, little was done because of the delayed announcement by the banks regarding money rates. Late in the afternoon it was announced that bankers' deposit rates were being reduced to 1 per cent., and a.corre- sponding decrease was made in discount houses' \" call\" and \" notice \" deposit rates to 1 per cent. and 1% per cent. respectively. Rates for bills were not marked down to uite the full 1 per cent., as a fall in the ank Rate had already been largely dis- counted. For December maturities the market quoted 2Y per cent., but the rate for January paper was 2%-2% per cent. A little business was said to have been done in \"hot\" Treasury bills at 2Y per cent. Clearing banks charged 2 per cent. for fresh accommodation, but renewals went on at 3 per cent. These latter rates will presumably be adjusted to-morrow. In the afternoon balances were available in out- side quarters at 1 Y per cent. LOANS J)lLCOINT PKE CENT. PER CENT. Bank Bills FineTradeBills Day- Short. 2 I Dec. Jan. 6 3 6 tn-day periods ntls. .

For the first time for nearly a week silver prices suffered a sharp relapse, spot being %d down at 23d per ounce and forward delivery %ed at 22'%ad per ounce. Speculators bought and sold, but business was quiet. It is understood that the Indian .Government has been the principal seller of late. Belga Lower There were few features of interest in the foreign exchange market. At the out- set Belgian belgas were again quoted at 23.50 to 23.75, but later on the rate was adjusted to 23.60 to 23.85. In the \" free\" section, Danish kroner were called 21 buyers, while Spanish pesetas hardened to 39 sellers. Italian lire depreciated further to 79. Advices from Buenos Aires announce the reintroduction of two official selling rates in Argentina-namely, 15 pesos to the Â£ for prime necessities and 17 for other imports. The official buyirig rate has been lowered from 15 to 13.50 to the Â£.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 28th Sept. A hesitant tone was apparent in the Stock Market owing to the possibility of a peace move following Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow. As a result, prices were mostly lower throughout the session. The close was easy. Total turnover was 770,000 shares fewer than yesterday at 1,570,000. The opening was easy, and despite indi- cations of growing support for repeal of the arms export embargo the market further declined during the morning, with Rails and Steels anything to a point down. Rails receded in face of an increase of more than 9,000 cars in the week's freight load- ings over a year ago. Steels fell owing to consumers of the products urging an an- nouncement of first-quarter prices. In the early afternoon the market again sold off over a broad front,. Steels, Rails and Farm Implements being very heavy. Nevertheless, a rally started on some sup- port. Commission houses reported liquida- tion from abroad, which was easily absorbed. Aircrafts and Motors declined, the latter group ignoring the surprising vitality of the demand for new models. Chemicals were sold, in spite of reports of sharply increased business in that industry. Coppers took the forefront of the rally on expectations of an advance in the price of the metal. The recovery, which coincided with the Senate Committee's approval of the amended Neutrality Act, failed to follow through, and the market turned quiet, with the final list mostly fractions to 2 points lower. All three Dow-Jones closing averages were lower, Industrials by 1.96 at 151.12, Rails 0.88 at 35.02 and Utilities 0.19 at 25.09. Of 897 stocks dealt in, 544 declined, only 171 improved and 182 were un- changed. Bulls will be disappointed if the Indus- trials average fails to cross the 12th Sep- tember high of 155.92 by the end of the week, so as to confirm the action of Rails in establishing a new peak. In the Bond market to-day U.S. Govern- ments were strong, but Railroads eased. Sales totalled $13,000,000, against $20,910,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Dec., 1931 = 100) was 169.8, against 170.7 yesterday. Domestic business news continues bright. The level of railroad freight traffic is now well above 1936. A Government survey covering 21,562 stores in 22 States showed a \" consistent increase\" in retail sales during the first eight months as compared with the like period of last year, states the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. H.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Once again the Stock Exchange admirably demonstrated yesterday its traditional gift of making the best of a bad job. Just before noon the Budget pill was given a belated sugar coating by the reduction in Bank Rate to 3 per cent. Gilt-Edged Stalemate When the House opened members at first simply looked at each other. How- ever, as soon as it was found that no pressure of selling was developing in any direction the tone became compara- tively cheerful. Bargain-hunters had in many directions to readjust their buying limits. The postponement of the issue of the Government's proposed loans to suit every taste was not to the immediate liking of the Consol market. Indeed, after the slight thaw of the previous day the temperature fell sharply. Apart from Conversion Four and a- Halfs-so largely held by the Money market-the cut in Bank Rate failed to resolve the stalemate in gilt-edged stocks. However, when investors learn this morning that deposit interest is being reduced to one per cent., it is assumed that considerable sums will be forced back into the Stock and Share Markets. Only when substantial buy- ing power develops will it be prudent to remove or reform the minimum price regulations. Search for High Yields Home Rails were again in rather persistent demand at rising prices. It is presumed that the companies will suffer little, if at all, from E.P.T. and that the junior prior charges should at any rate be allowed to receive the maximum dividend paid on them in recent years. Search for high yields to com- pensate. for record tax burdens was often baffled yesterday by a lack of stock on jobbers' books. Well-covered, and especially tax-free, Preferences were bid for on the argument that you know where you are as regards their dividends, whereas it would pass the wit of man to say as yet how equities as a whole will fare. Kaffir jobbers were calling attention to the undeniable attractions of the Rand dividend-payers at their current reduced prices. Recent rather heavy Continental selling appeared yester- day to have come to an end, and if it is not resumed the leading Kaffirs should gradually have a substantial recovery. When U.K. income-tax rises to the full 7s 6d British huldters of tWe chief Rand dividend-payers will, I understand, be entitled to Dominion tax relief of 3s 9d in the Â£. Yankee Transfer Plan Majority opinion in the American market yesterday appeared to be hardening against the plan for trans- ferring Yankee stocks on to the New York register by cable. As offsetting the obvious advantages of quick and safe delivery, two major objections have been raised. Firstly, it is contended that the pay- ment of the proposed fees in dollars in New York would be depriving the British Exchange Fund of a useful addition to its foreign currency re- sources. Secondly, it is considered that the scale of charges is excessive. Dealers calculate the average at fully 1 per cent. Real Money Since war broke out several million dollars' worth of securities must have been shipped to New York, and if 1 per cent. had been paid to American banks on the whole total the fees would clearly have run into real money. Some market men suggested yester- day that it would be unpatriotic to de- prive H.M. Government and the insur- ance companies of the war risks premiums incurred when stock is actually shipped. It is a. nice point. Personally, I think there is no sense in running unnecessary risks. On the whole, it was thought yeste'r- day that little or no use would be made by members of the London Stock Exchange of the new service, although presumably the American banks con- cerned will not formally withdraw it. .t 1ietarist",

   "article_dc_title" : "Markets' Good Resistance to Budget Shock",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "THURSDAY Evening. Apart from a further freezing up of the gilt-edged market, Stock Exchange reactions to the Budget shock were surprisingly good. The unexpectedly large increase in income-tax gave markets a depressed start, but the tone soon began to improve. Reduction of Bank Rate to 3 per cent. helped to restore confidence, and the atmosphere at the close was almost cheerful. Home Railways finished strong, and many Industrials were higher on the day, previous reductions in price having largely discounted the tax increases now effective. Transactions recorded in all markets totalled 1,931, against 2,530 yesterday. British Funds naturally bore the full impact of the income-tax shock, and were perhaps the most unsatisfactory market, Stocks saleable in small amounts at the minimum prices yesterday were practically unmarketable to-day. The market refused to take comfort from the Bank Rate cut, although dealers were discussing possibilities of to-day's reduc- tion foreshadowing a further fall to 2 per cent. next week. With the fresh drying-up of the market, the swapping of long-dated stocks for Conversion 4% per cent. on the basis of a high price for the latter tended to increase. Special transactions in Conversion 4%'s were marked up to 104%. There was also a good normal demand for the stock, which improved further to 101%, or a point above the fixed minimum. Gilt-edged prices Page 4 BONDS CONTINUE QUIET The Foreign bond market showed no signs of a revival of interest and turnover remained at a minimum. There were still some sellers of Belgian bonds about, but buyers were scarce, and the 4 per cent., 1936, issue lost yet another point to close at 51. Elsewhere in the European list there was very little activity. Slight demand for Argentine bonds con- tinued without having any further effect on prices. Chileans, on the other hand, were inclined to be sellers, and the 7% per cent. loan dropped to 12%, as compared with 13% previously. Some dealers re- ported a meagre inquiry for Japanese bonds, but transactions were few in number. Foreign bond prices Page 4 HOME RAILS IMPROVE Business in the Home Rail market con- tinued to expand, although turnover remained subnormal and widespread im- provements in prices were recorded. At the close four prior charge stocks could be sold above the unofficial minimum prices. Newcomer in this category during to-day's session was L.N.E.R. 4 per cent. First Preference;, for-hii:h the minimum price is 28. Stock on offer realised as much as 30 and the closing middle quotation was 31. L.M.S. 4 per cent. Preference were in demand and advanced 3% points to close at 55%, and the 1923 issue, which yesterday rose above the minimum for the first time, added a further 1% to 37. Among Ordinary stocks, Great Western were again in evidence, and buyers paid up to 31 for stock. Closing quotation was 3 points higher at 30. Elsewhere, Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary continued in demand and were finally 1% to the good at 58%. Prices in general closed very firm at or near the best levels for the day. The Foreign Rail market attracted little attention. Small inquiry for Argentines persisted, but buyers were able to obtain stock at overnight prices and no changes were recorded. Antofagasta were marked % lower at 8%, but there was no selling pressure. Among Empire Rails a number of large buying orders for Canadian Pacific came ,to market and the price improved % to 7%. Americans were quiet but steady. New York Central were quoted at 27%, 4 higher than previously, Atchison were marked at 41%s, against 40%, and Pennsyl- vania were also 1 point to the good at 33%. Home and Foreign Rail prices.Page 4 INDUSTRIALS CHEERFUL Mostly Higher at End After Initial Setback Industrials ended on a cheerful note after a dull opening. At the outset dealers lowered prices in the Brewery and Tobacco sections and in a few other instances, but when it was seen that no sellers had come forward sharp recoveries took place. Prices began to improve before the Bank Rate announcement and strengthened on the decision. Very little business actually was done, but there was some good inquiry in places for specialities, especially for tax-free Preference shares and for other Prefer- ence issues with dividends in arrear. The upward movement was said to have been helped by bear covering. Price movements were irregular, but in the popular groups gains predominated and the tendency at the finish was firm. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 85.2, against 84.6. Business in BANKING shares was almost restricted to Home issues, which remained firm, although a few sellers of Barclays \" B\" and Lloyds were about. Westmin- sters hardened to 67s. National of India and Standard of South Africa improved. Hongkong and Shanghai eased 2 points. With the exception of Prudential \"A,\" offered at 19, INSURANCE shares were steady but idle. ELECTRIC POWER securities lacked atten- tion. City of London Electrics fell Is to 25s. Elsewhere quotations were steady. In other Lighting issues, Imperial Conti- nental Gas stock was lowered 5 to 80. Siemens, on a small demand, rose Is to 19s, but other changes in ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS were nominal, more or less. The turnover was light. G.E.C. reacted la to 62s on a few sales. c c I 1 t a 1 1 S t f 1 i I t a A c i r E c \\ 1 c Little was going on in the MOTOR group, but the tone was satisfactory, and the only recession was in Austins to %, thus losing yesterday's gain of %. Leylands rallied K. Morris changed at 23s 9d and Fords at 14s 6d, but no alteration was -made in quotations. In AVIATION, Hawker Sid- deleys were 3d better at 11s 9d. Fairey were done at 14s and Bristol around 14s d. Apart from firmness of. Court Lines at 13s 9d. SaIPPING issues were easier in places. Falls of 6doccurred in Elder Demp- ster at 23s 6d, King Lines 22s 6d and Alex- ander Shipping at 16s Sd. Union-Castles were 9s 3d. Cable and Wireless stocks were firmer, but Marconi Marines fell 2s- to 24s 9d. Some improvement was shown in STEEL issues. Features were rises of 2s 6d to 25s in Guest Keen tax-free Second Preference and. Is 9d to 26s 3d in Vickers tax-free Pre- ference. Some Ordinary shares were T 1 P t4 el fe fa or higher, notably Stewarts and Lioyds with a gain of 9d to 38s 3d. Swan Hunters rose 6d to 31s 9d and Vickers 4%d further to 15s 9d. Indian Irons improved to 2%. - One minor feature was the renewed buy- ing of Imperial Chemicals, and following yesterday's rise of Is 6d the price was 9d higher at 27s 6d. Oxygens were steady and Murex were done at 76s 3d. Turner and Newall gained '/ further. United Molasses were firmer at 24s 6d on the strength of Distillers. Cement issues were easier in places. The dulness of TEXTILES was relieved by further recovery in Coats to 24s 9d buyers. Feature of the RAYON group was fresh strength of British Celanese, the Ordinary rising 7%d to 5s 7%d and First Preference 6d to 18s. American hardened. Courtaulds tailed off to 26s. Movements among STORES resulted in irregular changes. Woolworths rose ie, but Marks and Spencer fell %o. Drapery issues were dull and easier where changed. Montague Burtons were better at 10s. In many instances BREWERY shares opened lower, but by midday some shares rallied well. Benskins were 2s 6d up at 52s 6d and Watney Is 3d higher also at 52s 6d. Guinness and Bass at the end were down slightly. Distillers in the early deal- ings went down sharply to 83s, but left off good at 87s 6d, against 86s 6d yesterday. Likewise, leading TOBACcoS regained initial losses, and Imperials, at one time about 5, finished at 5%_. British-American were up %2 to 4%,. FOODSTUFF descriptions were steady, with a few Provision shares firmer. News- paper securities were marked down again in several instances. American Industrials were rather buyers, but not much stock was obtainable and business accordingly was quiet. Beth- lehems were 118, U.S. Steels 96.%, Nickels 48%, General Motors 67% and Chryslers 111. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS IDLE Rubber shares passed another idle ses- sion. The commodity again tended to ease, restricting de.nand in the share market, although there was some inquiry for high- class issues. Tamiang were favoured, and the price rose from 18s 9d to 19s 4%d. Devon Malacca advanced from 3s 6d to 4s and Bertam, in the florin group, closed harder at 2s 4%d. Elsewhere movements were downward. In Mincing Lane trading was very quiet. Anglo-Dutch were quoted at 23s 9d, Rubber Trust 27s, London Asiatic 3s 1%d and United Serdang 3s. The Tea share market on the Stock Ex- change remained inactive, though buyers were encouraged by the fact that there is to be no increased taxation on tea. Jore- haut added 9d at 27s, and Jas. Finlay finished at 42s 9d in comparison with 42s 6d yesterday. Tea shares were seldom. mentioned in Mincing Lane. Business was very slow, and quotations were little changed. Rubber and Tea prices Page 4 IRREGULAR OIL CHANGES Contrary influences caused irregular movements in the Oil market. The general tone was inclined to dulness at the start, but showed a hardening tendency in some directions as the session progressed. Preference shares turned noticeably firmer after the announcement of the Bank Rate reduction. Resumed selling on Amsterdam account caused fresh weakness in Royal Dutch, which closed a point lower at 36%. Shells also were depressed and weakened 16 to 4%. Trinidad Leaseholds met with a little support and improved %i, to 4'3/,, but Trinidad Petroleum Developments fell back Is 6d to 52s. Rumanian issues eased sharply owing to European uncertainties, Phoenix at 3s and Steaua Romana at 2s 9d losing 9d apiece. Burmahs, the interim dividend on which is being maintained at 5 per cent., were % down at 3e.. Oil share prices Page 4 SOME KAFFIRS ADVANCE Declines Predominate in Other Mining Sections There was little fresh selling of Kaffirs. Further declines in some of the heavier priced issues chiefly represented the con- tinued adverse influence of shares unloaded on the market by Continental holders during preceding days. On the other hand, the lower prices were attracting rather more support. This was not described as more than nibbling, but it sufficed to cause a number of recoveries in quotations. On the day rises and falls were fairly evenly balanced. The dividend-payers again attracted the bulk of attention.

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange reaction to the unexpected severity of the Budg't proved to be what might have been fore- cast in advance by anybody who had taken such an austere view as that which Sir John Simon elaborated on Wednesday night. The Brewery market went back. Tobacco shares fell away, and throughout the House as a whole a generally dull tone set in. This con- tinued until lunch-time. Then came a sudden change. In the Industrial market they started bidding for Imperial Tobacco, Chemicals, Dis- tillers, and a number of other shares the prices of which had been sharply depressed earlier in the morning. The Home Railway Prior Charge group forged ahead. Investors and Bears A stronger tone manifested itself on, according to the generally accepted ex- planation, a modicum of genuine buy- ing, and about a similar volume of support from the bear party. So narrow are the markets of to-day that it takes little to put prices up or down. Yesterday's change-over, dramatic in its extent and swiftness, was altogether out of proportion to the actual amount of trade that caused it. Business seemed to be patchy: the net profit on their. day could have been hardly enough to cover the cost to many mem- bers of to-day's Michaelmas goose. Bank Rate Three per Cent. When Mr. Edward Cripps, senior partner in the Stock Exchange firm of Messrs. Mullens and Co. and broker to the Government, announced that \" Bank Rate is 3 per cent,\" there arose such hubbub of noise as caused many of us, not immediately noticing the change, to ask whether a stranger had got into the House. Mr. Cripps made his maiden speech in this connection, and the announcement was generally cheered. Betting before- hand had been about fifty-fifty on a change. The effect was practically nil; so far, that is to say, as any unfreezing of the Consol market prices was concerned. War Loan became no easier to sell at 88% after the announcement than it was before it. Good for Gold Shares As soon as the Consol and gilt-edged markets again become liquid, the in- vestor's speculative attention will turn to Gold-mining shares that yield a reasonable rate of return on the money. People are not buying Kaffirs now, but such shares as Crown Mines, Sub Nigel, Union Corporation, Nigel Gold, Klein- fontein, East Geduld, and various others are fairly sure to attract interest, sooner or later, from money requiring a good yield. South African shares paying divi- dends on which dominion relief is allowed will not escape for long the scrutiny of the speculative investor. The Twilight of Uncertainty The principal, and the unanimous, Stock Exchange criticism of the Budget Speech is that it contained no statement in regard to the terms upon which the next Defence Loan will be issued. Sus- pense still persisting, the Consol and the gilt-edged markets are no \"further forrader\" than they were before. Had the Chancellor of the Exchequer but given some idea of the Government's intentions in regard to the forthcoming loan, this would have at least afforded a basis upon which the House could work. Lacking such basis, everything remains in the same twilight condition as before. Sir John Simon can be assured that, until he makes a definite statement as to the terms, Stock Ex- change markets will remain in that state of uncertainty from which the Treasury and, incidentally, the Stock Exchange as well, will be only too thankful to escape.

   "text_content" : "** The reduction of Bank Rate to three per cent. yesterday provided a useful antidote in certain sections of the Stock Markets to the unexpected severity of some of the Chancellor's war Budget demands. The indirect levies, on spirits, beer and tobacco, had been heavily discounted by the movements in share quotations in the last few weeks, with the result that any further adverse movement there was soon recovered. In the gilt-edged market, upon which attention will be centred for a long time to come in view of the vast extent to which taxa- tion will have to be supplemented by Government borrowing, the position was by no means so badly affebted as it might have been in face of the added weight of income-tax, if this had had to be considered by itself. With a tax of 7s 6d in the pound in prospect, a nominal yield of 4 per cent., for example, will become no more than 2J per cent. net. This naturally will exercise an important influence upon the terms which will ensure the success that must be a major psychological objective when the time comes for the launching of a war loan. In conjunction with a relatively high Bank Rate, therefore, the position created by the Budget alone would have been an unsatisfactory one for the gilt- edged market, already finding its minimum prices tending to restrict dealings. Thus the action of the Bank in lowering its rate was most timely, probably fitting better into the scheme of things than it would have done if it had taken place a week or two ago. Its full effect may not be visible for a while, and it may be that, as some ob- servers were predicting yesterday, it will prove only the precursor of another early reduction. The Government has not abandoned its ideal of a cheap money policy. Although the term must be relative in present circumstances, official control of capital issues by public authorities or by trading under- takings assures the Treasury against any unwarranted competition against itself in its bid for the savings of the investor. A high Bank Rate is un- necessary as a weapon against either speculation or unwise industrial ex- pansion. There is no need to consider its sinan- cial effects abroad in present circum- stances. Movements of capital into or out of the country are in no wise governed by it, and it cannot be used to regulate the value of sterling ex- change. Its real functions are purely internal, although as an indication of strength and confidence a low level is likely to impress foreign opinion favour- ably. The strength exists to inspire that confidence. British national savings are now at the highest level they have ever reached, so that there is no ques- tion of the abundance of our financial resources. The currency position is very healthy, a contraction of some Â£4,500,000 in the note circulation during the past week showing that the excep- tional demands of the evacuation period are rapidly giving place to a more normal monetary flow. In this fourth week of war, therefore, Britain is as soundly placed as could be expected, but even so will be not ungrateful for the relief given in the cost of its Treasury bill borrowing by the abandonment of a Four per Cent. Rate for which there was no longer any justification.",

   "text_content" : "Although the trading results of United Steel Companies show a rather larger fall in the year to June than might have been expected and the profit balance is down from Â£2,426,500 to Â£1,939,000, the report covers a period of important transition and expansion. The interest which the company took in John Summers in January, financed by an increase in its own capital in November, did not yield a return, but a few days ago Summers declared an interim on its Ordinary shares. Meanwhile, the balance-sheet shows not only the new Summers investment but also a very large increase in the amounts ad- vanced to the United Steel subsi- diaries and substantial additions to the company's own works. The transfer to the central reserve for depreciation and obsolescence is increased slightly, but that to taxation reserve is sharply cut. The dividend, reduced from 10 per cent. on the old capital to 8 per cent. on the new, is earned with some Â£20,000 to spare, and after a doubling of the general reserve allocation at Â£200,000 the carry-forward is reduced from Â£591,300 to Â£411,600. It should be noted that total reserves have been raised from Â£5,266,700 to Â£5,941,200 during the year. The recent firm tone of the Â£1 Ordinary, which stands at 21s, appears well justified. Both ex- tensions at Appleby-Frodingham, now completed, and the association with John Summers should bear good fruit.",

During the twelve months to June last the downward trend con- tinued, and although the fall in profits is not so steep the net amount is no better than Â£16,500.

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Banking and Money market circles welcomed the reduction in Bank Rate yesterday. Tbe big banks prefer to spend less in interest on deposits, since they never derive full compensa- tion from the higher rates obtained on. Treasury bills and advances. They will be able to fill up their bill port- folios more easily. The discount market will recoup a considerable part of the losses it in- curred when the Bank Rate was raised in August. It will now sell bills recently secured at high rates at a substantial profit. The cost of carry- ing stock on borrowed money will also be reduced. A Great Help The lower cost of financing Treasury bill borrowings will be of great help to the Government. The question of future National loan issues has to be considered. Industry may benefit fr6m reduced over- draft charges, a crumb of comfort after the stiff Budget medicine. The return to cheaper money is not an inflationary move. Cheap money is only inflationary if it stimulates excessive pri- vate borrowing in competition with the State. That is now impossible because of the Treasury control over new issues. Then the fact that sterling is adequately safe- guarded by exchange restrictions and that there is no speculation on the stock or commodity markets justified a lower Bank Rate. Fewer Notes The Bank return shows that nearly Â£4.7 millions of notes returned from active cir- culation during the week making almost Â£12,000,000 in the fortnight. While part of this was due to foreigners handing over sterling notes, the bulk by far was caused by the movement towards normality. As already stressed in this column, the authorities have now gained valuable knowledge of note demands in various dis- tricts, while the big banks have discovered that they can carry smaller \" till\" reserves with their branches. Aggregate note requirements of the banks have declined considerably and the return of evacuees will accentuate the fall- ing-off in currency demands. The authori- ties again did little to neutralise the note reflux and this was regarded as indicating that official quarters intend to maintain easy money.",

While the company already enjoys a substantial demand for its products in the form of ball and roller bearings, both from transport and in- dustry, it is also developing other markets for precision parts designed to lead to considerable expansion of the business. The net profit of Â£160,500 is Â£6,500 more than in 1938, and the dividend of 20 per cent. is paid with a substantial margin. The addition of Â£50,000 to reserve brings the total to Â£350,000, and the carry- forward is raised by Â£5,500 to Â£67,100.

Receipts expanded and working expenses were only moderately larger than in the previous year, their ratio to gross receipts falling from 66.65 to 64.38 per cent. The surplus of revenue rose from Â£51,200 to Â£60,500. As most of the company's revenue is derived from traffic with Nyasaland, the results of the Governmental inquiries into the question of closer economic development between Nyasaland and the Rhodesias have been studied with close interest. Mr. Vivian L. Oury observed at the meeting, however, that no decision with regard to the recommendations of the Commissions can be expected yet owing to concentration of Government energies on the prosecution of the war. One factor of promise for the future is the work of constructing the first Me- tion of railway to connect Tete with the Central Africa Railway at Dona Ana. When completed this project will pro- vide through rail communication from Tete. and Portuguese territory north of the Zambesi to the Port of Beira, where the two new deep water wharves are almost completed. ..^.^.^.tfA^^wÂ»^^.fc^Â«.n^.^'iÂ«^^Â»Â«MÂ«Ml>)uB^^i)a^",

Correspondents indly noate that this offer does not apptl to our contributor \" Autolycus' or \" The Diarist.' Postal address: 72. Coleman-street, E.C.2. Telegrams: \" Finantimo, AMe., London.\" Curious, Bournemouth-We should think that the company will be able to maintain pay- ments of its Preference interest, and in our opinion the shares should be held. Gilroy-In view of the state of the motor in- dustry, consequent on the war, there would seem to be no hurry to purchase the shares named. H. L. W., Exeter-The stock named has never achieved the distinction of being a Trustee security. H. R. T.-(a) Last dividend on No. 1 was in January. There has been no dividend on No. 2 since September, 1938. Payment of an interim dividend on No. 3 has been post- poned, and the last payment was made in March (b) Yes, on English registered companies. (c) No. (d) There may be a certain amount of delay. (e) Better hold S. E. Oppermans for the present. Kaffir-Maintenance of dividends on Rand gold producers seems the least that can be expected, anyway for the time being. Against an average of 142s 6d in 1938 revenue is being based this month on a gold price of 150s an ounce, against 148s in the past seven months and 148s 6d in January. Ketton-The name of the company has been changed to Sterling Electric Holdings. The Preference shares are quoted at 5-16th. Lawson-We would not buy more just now. Loumax-The general outlook for mining finance houses is clouded by deterioration in the value of portfolios, curtailment of opportunities for profitable share dealing and the possible necessity in some instances for a conservation of funds in order to keep non-producing subsidiaries going. These considerations are affecting the shares, but we would not sell after the fall that has already taken place. Sperans Vivo-In the event of the shares ad- vancing to the extent suggested, we think it would probably be wise to secure the good profit which would then become available. Tin-Tin companies with several dredges are obviously better placed to take advantage of sharply increased output requirements than single dredge concerns. The sug- gested exchange may thus be worth while. Petaling is not liable for British taxes. W. D. McL.-The units are quoted daily in our list of Unit Trusts closing prices. Windsor-1. We are afraid you will find that these are unsaleable, and it is useless to attempt to dispose of them at the present time. 2. Interest payments should be main- tained, and we do not advise you to sell. 3. The address is Salisbury House, London- wall, E.C.2.",

   "text_content" : "The nineteenth annual general meeting of the Trans-Zambesia Railway Company was held yesterday at the registered office of the company, 3, Thames House, Queen- street Place, E.C.4. MR. VIVIAN L. OURY (the chairman) said: My first duty is to refer to the great loss sustained by the company by the death last May of my father, Mr. Libert Oury, O.B.E., who, as all of you know, was responsible for the formation of the com- pany and was, since its incorporation, its chairman. The Companhia de MoCambique, who in accordance with the terms of our concession have the right to nominate the chairman of the company, have done me the honour of appointing me to that post, and I can assure you that I shall devote all my zeal and energy to furthering the interests of the company. During the current year Sir Henry Chapman, C.B.E., has joined the Board of your company, and I do not think he needs any introduction from me, for his record as general manager of Rhodesia Railways is well known to you all, and his knowledge of African affairs and railway matters will be invaluable to us. After dealing with the accounts, Mr. Oury said: In the early part of the current year unprecedented floods were experi- enced in the Zambesi Valley, the flood waters rising to a higher level than any recorded in recent times. The South Approach embankment was thus exposed to a severer test than any it has had since its construction, and it may be said with- out hesitation that the decision to carry the South Approach line on an embank- ment designed to resist the Zambesi flood waters has more than justified itself, for many thousands of acres of land south of the railway were protected from inunda- tion and through communications were never interrupted. The embankment itself, although settling slightly under these very severe conditions and becoming soft in places, is now completely consoli- dated and will provide no cause for anxiety. At last year s meeting reference was also made to the fact that the Portuguese Government had called for tenders for the construction of the first 100 kilometres of the railway to connect Tete with the exist- ing Central Africa Railway line at Dona Ana. The contract for the construction of these first 100 kilometres of railway has ben placed and the work of constructing the line by Messrs. Pauling and Co., the contractors, is now making good progress. As the recent visit to Beira of His Excel- lency the President of the Portuguese Republic, General Carmona, accompanied by the Colonial Minister, Dr. Francisco Vieira Machado, has been fully reported in the Press, I think that all I need say about it is that the visit was a great success and that the ceremonies that took place during the course of it iot only demonstrated the successful achievements of Portugal in the field of colonisation but also proclaimed in the most striking manner the cordiality of the relations between our own country and Portugal. The ceremonies were attended by the Governors of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasa- land, and on the conclusion of his visit to Beira the President proceeded to the Union of South Africa, where also he had a great reception. I think it will be a matter of interest to you to know that your company was represented at the ceremonies at Beira by three of your directors, Senhor Joao de Azevedo Coutinho, Sir Henry'Chapman and myself. I should like on behalf of my colleagues and myself to express our appreciation of the valuable and friendly assistance which the Companhia de Mogambique continue to give us. The report and accounts were adopted unanimously. *------",

   "text_content" : "The twelfth ordinary general meeting of Cohen Weenen and Co., Ltd., was held yesterday at 112, Commercial-street, E. MR. ARTHUR DONN (chairman and managing director) said that the total amount of profit available was Â£81,819 and it was proposed to pay a dividend of 9 per cent. on the Ordinary shares, the same as for the previous year. The year under review had been a particularly difficult one and he thought that under the circum- stances they had no reason to be dissatis- fied with the figures before them. They had completed the move from their old factory to the present premises during July and August. Then there had followed the crisis of September, 1938, and later the Budget increase in the duty on leaf tobacco. Although they had had to pay higher prices for leaf tobacco in order to maintain the superior quality of their many pro- ducts, they had been able to effect economies and maintain their profit despite the difficulties. Their chief brand, Afrikander, which now sold in four popular and different forms-namely, Mixture, Flake. Shag and Navy-had maintained its outstanding position among pipe tobaccos. Royal Seal, Sweet Crop and Classic Curly Cut continued to enjoy great popularity with smokers of the more expensive tobaccos. Since the end of the financial year under review they had enjoyed two more or less normal months' trading in July and August and the result of that period was an im- provement on the corresponding two months of the previous year. They were engaged in manufacturing products which, by all previous experience, should continue to be in demand during war-time. The report was unanimously adopted.",

   "text_content" : "Bank Rate was yesterday reduced from 4 per cent., effective since 24th August, to 3 per cent. In the gilt-edged market, where a reduction had been eagerly awaited, the decline failed to counteract the unfavourable impression created by the raising of the standard rate of income- tax to 7s 6d. The Money market had fully anticipated that a change would be made, the only point being whether the authorities would follow what was previously normal procedure on the occasion of reducing the official minimum and cut by J per cent. only or whether they would decide upon a full 1 per cent. fall. Sir John Simon said in the House of Commons yesterday that under the protection of the higher Bank Rate in the past three weeks they had got into complete working order control of capital issues, of foreign exchanges and of imports. The last occasion on which Bank Rate was 3 per cent. was on 21st April, 1932, during the period when a series of reductions brought the minimum to the 2 per cent. level which lasted from 30th June, 1932, to 24th August, 1939. Surprise had been expressed that the 4 per cent. level established on 24th August had been maintained, so long. It had com- pletely lost its effectiveness and discount rates in Lombard Street had fallen sharply. Indeed, anticipations of a reduction in the official minimum had made the discount market reluctant to sell its bills, with the result that the clearing banks had been unable to satisfy their needs. This had caused a certain amount of friction in some quarters. MILLIONS SAVED Govt. and Business The reduction in Bank Rate will mean the saving of millions in Government Treasury bill borrowings. One per cent. on to-day's offer amounts to Â£550,000, a not inconsiderable saving. Discount houses and banking firms carrying Government loans on borrowed money will be gainers through the reduced cost of their short-term loans, while the big banking institutions will pay millions less in interest on deposits. Furthermore, terms at which the Government will be able to issue National Defence Loans will be affected by the decrease of short-money rates. Lombard Street business was virtually at a standstill before the decision was made known. For some time afterwards there were only tentative transactions pending the decision of the banks regard- ing money rates. The banks subsequently announced that their rates for deposits would be 1 per cent. instead of 2 per cent., thus main- taining the margin between Bank Rate and the banks' deposit rates. Discount houses lowered their deposit rates by the same amount, allowing 1 per cent. for \"call\" deposits and 1% per cent. on \"notice\" deposits. The clearing banks intimated that their minimum charges for call money would \" not be less than 2 per cent,\" which, presumably, means 2 per cent. against bills. For advances against bonds the rate will be 2% per cent. The lowering of Bank Rate was followed by a drop in discount rates for all classes of paper. TAX EFFECT ON GILT-EDGED Offset to Rate Cut Bank Rate decline to 3 per cent. was offset as an influence to the gilt-edged market by the raising of income-tax to 7s 6d. Dealers had been anticipating an advance to 6s 6d at the most and the effect of the disappointment at the higher charge now imposed was to cause business to dry up, although the operation of- minimum prices prevented quotations from reflecting the sentimental effect. On Tuesday and Wednesday a few of the more important gilt-edged stocks could be sold in small amounts at the minimum prices without much difficulty. Yesterday the business changed for the worse to the extent that such sales were impossible in the normal course of business. Where sales occurred they were generally effected in consideration of a contra purchase by the seller of one of the dated securities. This fact was evident from the number of special markings in Four and a-Half per Cent. Conversion 1940-44, which -ranged up to 104%, compared with a mini- mum quotation of 100%. The special attraction of this stock as a short-dated issue brought about a further improvement in the price for normal dealings, the price rising % to 101%. The decline in Bank Rate was considered encouraging as far as it goes, and the market immediately began discussing the possibility of a further cut to 2 per cent. next week. It is believed that although the market is still frozen up the amount of selling orders awaiting execution is smaller than has been generally believed and that if any official support were given to the market the overhanging selling in- structions might be cleared up very rapidly. If Bank Rate were to be cut to 2 per cent. the deposit rate would go down to Y per cent., which might force some money now on deposit into the gilt-edged market.

   "text_content" : "e It e n d n n It t. a Is d d e s e, e 11 n Is d IS it i- ,e It e n it le Reference to the Bank Rate and the Reference to the Bank Rate and the Government's future loan policy was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he replied to the debate on the Budget in the House of Commons last night. Explaining why the Bank Rate was raised by 2 per cent. in August, he said the policy recommended at Ottawa was a policy of cheap money designed to deal with a world slump in commodity prices, but at the end of August the situation they had to face was not one of world slump: it was a situation in which clouds were gathering. To an upward bound in prices what was necessary was to demonstrate at once that we intended to get a firm grip on the situa- tion, for there were already fears that prices would go rapidly up. Those were the circumstances in which the Bank Rate was raised. He agreed that putting up the Bank Rate was a pro- cess which acted generally without dis- crimination on rates of borrowing, but it immediately checked what might otherwise be very dangerous developments which might get the whole thing out of control. It gave time to devise more discriminative methods for controlling inflationary tendencies. MONETARY CONTROL Under the protection of the higher rate in the past three weeks they had got into complete working order complete control of capital issues, control of the foreign exchanges and control of imports and stopped various unnecessary forms of trade. All this had the effect of canalising expenditure and enabling people to borrow money for useful purposes but stopping un- social and dangerous use of these facilities. That prevented borrowing for certain purposes that under the stringent condi- tions of war were not in the national interest. The question whether a high Bank Rate affected long-term loans was disputed by economists, but practical experience showed that while the Bank Rate remained stationary for several years there were extremely sharp fluctuations in the price of long-term Government stocks. Two and a-half per cent. Consols rose from about 67% to about 94 over several years, then they declined for several years from 94 to 60. As regards future loan policy, though he was planning to get the Budget out of the way the time was rapidly approaching when borrowing plans must be announced. While the Government could not anticipate the proposal it would make, he could say that the object was to borrow from.the genuine savings of the people at the lowest rate that it could do so. The Budget resolutions were agreed to.",

The total dividend of 8 per cent., as previously announced, is payable on a larger capital and requires Â£559,700, as against Â£646,198, the amount absorbed by the 10 per cent. for the previous year. Available earnings were equivalent to 11.7 per cent. gross on the present capital of Â£9,650,000. The final dividend of 5j per cent. will be payable, less tax at the altered rate of 7s. The net profit is Â£735,683, compared with Â£913,467. The balance is after Â£679,581, or Â£4,581 more, for depreciation, but Â£480,000, or Â£316,000 less, for taxa- tion. Debenture redemption takes Â£43,720. The allocation to reserve is doubled at Â£200,000, and Â£130,000 (against Â£150,000) is put to staff funds and Â£25,716 to share and note issue expenses. The carry-for- ward is Â£411,600, as against Â£591,333 brought in. Total reserves will stand at Â£5,941,185. EXTENSIONS COMPLETED During the first half of the year, it is stated, the decline in demand for iron and steel continued. In January it began to improve and for the last six months of the year the company and its subsidiaries have operated at a high rate. Prices of iron and steel products were substantially reduced on 1st January. The extensions to the iron and steel works of the Appleby-Frodingham Com- pany have been completed. In January an arrangement was made with John Summers and Sons under which the company subscribed for 1,288,185 shares of Â£1. Stocks stand in the balance-sheet at Â£889,848, a decrease of Â£144,053 on the year. Debtors are higher at Â£1,547,496 (against Â£1,229,081).

   "text_content" : "The Budget is accepted among indus- trialists as imposing burdens inevitable in view of the exceptional circumstances of the time. Although the necessity was regretted, the decision to raise so large an amount of the cost of the war by taxation rather than by. borrowing was welcomed from the viewpoint that it should be a safe- guard against inflation, and that as an offset to the heavy burden of taxation the taxpayer should benefit by the higher purchasing power of money. The Chancellor's remarks as to the necessity for maintaining export trade were warmly endorsed. It was pointed out that if we could not maintain a large volume of exports we were not going to get foreign exchange for the purchase of food and raw materials and also munitions of war LICENSES DELAY Traders declared that there had been considerable delay in obtaining export licenses. Representations had been made to the Board of Trade and it was hoped that this matter would soon be satisfac- torily settled. It was necessary to try to achieve some balance between production for exports and production for home use. These should not be regarded as two separate matters. In one quarter it was suggested that if a time arrived when we could purchase armaments from the United States it might be that it would be better to manu- facture goods for export and to use the proceeds to buy munitions of war in America. Emphasis was laid upon the fact that it would be essential to maintain a high level of internal trade in order that' money should be provided for revenue from taxa- tion. HIGHER BEER PRICES In consequence of the higher duty retail beer prices are expected to be raised in most localities on Monday by ld a pint. Representatives of brewery companies found it difficult yesterday to assess the effect upon sales of the higher taxation. One leading brewer pointed out that it was too early to say what the effect would be on consumption. Comparison with 1931 -when Mr. Snowden raised the tax by a penny a pint-might be misleading. On that occasion there were a great number of unemployed, and trade and industry were entering upon a recession. Now with the prospect of full employment, on muni- tions and other wartime needs, consump- tion might be much better maintained. Tobacco companies are undecided as to how the increase in taxation is to be passed on to the public. Leading manufacturers gave no instructions yesterday to tobacco- nists permitting them to increase charges on existing stocks. A decision is, never- theless, expected whereby the price of the popular brand cigarettes will be raised from 6.%d to 7d for ten. Tobacco prices will be advanced by lY1d an ounce. Sugar dealers are unconcerned at the increase of the duty, as the market is under the complete control of the Govern- ment for which they act as agents on a fixed commission basis. RUBBER VIEWS In the Rubber share market it was con- tended that if the year 1938 is used as a basis for the new Budget taxation there will be little excess profit in the 1939 earn- ings of the producing companies. The current season is considered to be scarcely better than the last. Some quar- ters feared that the Government might make its own datum line, in which case the companies might be seriously hit. WAR PROFITS TAX Company directors and secretaries were much concerned yesterday with the Budget provisions regarding excess profits tax, armaments profits duty and national defence contribution. There was a general disposition to await the issue of the Finance Bill to see the full terms of the Chancellor's proposals. The view was expressed that many intricate problems will be raised and that the legal profession is likely to have a busy time in interpreting the law as regards incidence on individual companies."

The only informa- tion available to-night was that these loans will be launched as soon as market condi- tions are favourable. The Treasury has already begun to use the axe on Government Departments and talks are proceeding between the Chan- cellor's representatives and other Depart- ments with a view to the most ruthless economies in matters not strictly concerned with the winning of the war. It will be necessary to hold up many schemes which in normal conditions might be considered beneficial but which are in- compatible with the full concentration of national energy and resources at the present time. The Chancellor is hoping to make an early announcement in the House of Commons regarding these economies, which, in many respects, will be on a considerable scale. The Prime Minister stated to-day that the second reading of the Finance Bill (No. 2) would be taken on Monday next and the Committee stage on Wednesday and Thursday.",

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange Committee has been officially informed that the Eight per Cent. Participating Preference and Ordinary shares of the Mexican Eagle Oil Company do not fall within the scope of the Treasury restrictions on dealings in certain foreign issues. The impression that dealers had wrongly included these issues in their list of securities likely to be affected by the restrictions was referred to in THE FINANCIAL TIMES last week. The importance of the announcement is that it is the first occasion that the Com- mittee has been able to obtain official guidance on a particular issue. Efforts to obtain a lead as to all the issues affected have been without success. The securities covered by the regula- tions are those in respect of which the principal, interest or dividends are payable in the currency of any of the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Holland and the Dutch East Indies, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United States of America. Holders cannot sell, transfer or do any- thing which involves the creation of a charge on any securities covered by the Order without the permission of or on behalf of the Treasury. The returns have to be made through stockbrokers and the banks. FLOOD OF RETURNS An overwhelming response to the Treasury Order that owners should make a return of their holdings to the Bank of England is the reason for the extension of the closing date to 9th October. Coming within the scope of the Order are large numbers of Russian, Chilean, Brazilian and Mexican securities which, at the moment, are considered by Stock Exchange members to be quite useless for the Treasury's purpose-namely, the pro- vision of foreign currencies abroad. Responding to the letter of the law, holders have duly filed particulars of their holdings with the result that the Bank of England is flooded with returns, many relating to useless securities. Nearly 400,000 returns have been filed by stock- brokers alone. Those passed through the banks probably bring the total up to about 1,000,000. No official list was issued by the Treasury or the Bank of England as to the individual securities concerned. In the absence of this list, Stock Exchange dealers compiled their own, as a guide only, and owing to its hasty preparation many issues were included in error, while others were wrongly excluded. Mining dealers now work on the basis that Kaffirs should have been excluded from the list and in the Railway market it is taken for granted that Canadian Pacific Common shares should have been included.",

This, it is stated, includes special provision for excep- tional contingencies due to the inter- national situation. No dividend on the Ordinary is proposed. For 1937-38 a net profit was made of Â£146,496, against Â£313,964 the year before. The Â£146,496 included Â£81,937 from the sale by an associated company of a radio interest. A 'dividend of 5 per cent., less tax, was paid on the Ordinary capital of Â£2,902,874 10s (in 10s shares), as com- pared with 10 per cent. for both 1936-37 and 1935-36. Forward balance was Â£298,418. The company, now eight and a-half years old, is the holding concern for Granophone Company and Columbia Graphophone Com- pany. It also controls H.M.V.

   "text_content" : "n x lul lrl rLllU U. currency notes Irom circulation despite end-month and quarter influences is shown by the Bank of England weekly return. The actual contraction in the active note circulation was Â£4,664,711, making a total of nearly Â£11.6 millions over the past fort- night and reducing the active issue to Â£541,833,476. In the corresponding week of last year there was an efflux of Â£21.7 millions. As there was also a small addition to gold and silver last week the reserve in the Banking Department rose by Â£4,766,704 to Â£38,994,622, so that, despite a rise of Â£1.8 millions to deposit liabilities, the ratio im- proved by 3 per cent. to 23.2 per cent. Although the authorities only actively offset the reflux of currency to the extent of Â£1,530,000 by the sale of Government securities, a drop of just over Â£5,000,000 in other securities had the effect of reducing the credit base by Â£1.6 millions. This, however, was again completely reflected in a drop of Â£1.6 millions in public deposits, so that bankers' deposits, or market resources, were virtually unchanged at Â£107,130,863, evidence of the easy short- loan conditions prevailing during the period under review.

Organising sources of supply to com- pensate for the large quantity of coke and coal imported before the outbreak of hos- tilities from Germany is being actively pursued by the authorities here. The negotiations for a general revision of commercial relations with the Belgians now taking place in Paris, are expected to include provision for important addi- tional supplies of coke. A very substantial portion of the addi- tional requirements will, I understand, come from the British coalfields. Holland is also a source of supply as far as coke is concerned, but negotiations are not yet in any advanced stage and difficulties in arriving at agreement are greater for various reasons, including that of finding countervailing exports to Holland which that country could find acceptable.",
