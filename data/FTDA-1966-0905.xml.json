Although the National Union of Mineworkers will be in the two-way position of voting in favour of the pay freeze but against legislation to enforce the vetting of wage claims, the Government seems assured of a vote of confidence in the economic debate next Wednesday. Left-wing unions in opposition to the Government now have only one-hope of victory-in legal action which is being taken by a member of the 796,000-strong General and Municipal Workers' Union in an attempt to prevent the union from voting in support of the Government on Wednesday. The man who is challenging this indomitably Right-wing union is Mr. Leonard McNamee, its Burnley branch secretary. On his behalf writs were served last night on five lading officials of the'.

'But he added that during the perfbd between -the annual con- ferences of the OMWU the body responsible for deciding the union's policy was its general council.

These Opponents of the Government knew that the NUM's 446.000 votes would have to be cast in favour of the union's own motion, how. ever unhappy the NUM leadership miSht be about this. However the ruse is unlikely to work because the majority of unions find it an unsatisfactory way of opposing the Government.

The new \"hard\" line which has emerged from Downing Street over the past few days goes against the direction in which British policy seemed to be moving until very recently. to particular, there is a new in- sistence:that Britain will not agree to any UN involvement whatsoever. Tactical Skill , mnost I lyI r.lanatInr position from which le. could, IU r ture, retire or .oomr rd. mui \"in re1turn for a similar cbni* pt'o1me from his' African critics. He could thus hope to come out of the conference with a policy Dot very different from the one he really started with. Fourteen Heads of Government will attend the Conference, and all the other nine member-States except Tanzania will be repre* snted by senior Ministers. Most of the delegationi have alread arrived fn London, and many- o. them have made statements in which they make the unexception. able point that Rhodesia willn the main issue at the Conference and that the fate of the Common. wealth is at stake. The Conference lasts until September 15, and there is there. fore plenty of time for more-than token discussion of other topics. %ut the stand Mr. Wilson takes over Rhodesia will decide .te mood of theConference and So far to determie lth very futur of the CoinmW wealth, The mast question which will occupy the Preiers' time will be whether or not to go to the UN for manlato~r anctioni, against Rho a. Th e official British line ls flatly opposed to any move in this direction. Many of the delegations accept the British argument that a general UN ban on Rhodesian trade would risk a headn culash with South Africaitwhich neither Britain nor the UNlItself could afford. S'Loopholes\" SBut there Is a growing feeling lhat the most important \"loop- holes\" in the sanctions programme could be plugged by a carefully limited UN ban which South Africa might feel was not worth a major crisis. One example often discussed is oil: it is suggested that a UN ban on the transport of oil Continued on Page 5 mlen' talks Pane S Rhodeila before Premler' talks Page S Continued from Page 1 WILSON PREPARES TO FACE COMMONWEALTH CRITICS into Rhodesia, even by rail alone (this would leave a minor loophole at Beit Bridge on the South African border) would be taken as a warn- ing .by .th Portuguese and South African Governments. It is further suggested that to reinforce the UN res9lution, the South Africans could be quietlywarned that if they openly defy such a limited sanction, they will,be in danger of an oil embargo- themselves. This would be applied not by naval blockade but simply by the cutting. off of bulk supplies by the producer countries and the-international oil companies. There is reason to believe that the idea of a strictly limited re- course to the UN would not be entirely unacceptable to the British Government, provided other coun- tries acted as sponsors. An attempt at a.blanket ban would probably be veto6d by one otBrita n's aillie' with connivance from London. Another important question will be the terms of a future settle- ment betweeti Britain and Rhodesia. There is great concern in Common wealth circles that Mr. Wilson is prepared to \"sell out\" to the White Rhodesians. This concern is hardening into an insistence that Britain should refuse to give ind-' pendence to Rhodesia before majority rule is achieved. This I seen as the only way to ensure that .White supremacy is defeated in Rhodesia. and there is widespread bewilderment, rapidly becoming indignation, as to why Mr. Wilson will not make a firm commitment on this point. Many of the Commonwealth leaders are simply unable to understand Mr. Wilson's refusal to offer his word on this. It has now got to the stage where either he gives' up this evasiveness at this Conference or ht forfeit for good the'tr6s't' of ,Common, wealth leaders.",

   "text_content" : "By LEX The Government's delay in implementing Plowden means that it is as bard to ~seas pros. pects for the bulk dE the U.K. aerospace industry Ã½,-day as it was ,two years ago. Then Hawker Siddeley was looking forward to good business from its advanced VTOL-profcts, the P-1154 and the HSÂ·1., and BAC was substantially shored up by the TSR-2 programme. Now all these aircraft are on the -scrap heap and while Hawker has a fat military order book as a result of the defence review, BAC's futura is depen- dent on further orders for the One-Eleven and Concord on the civil side, and the two Anglo- French projects on the military side. Many imponderables Until we know whether and on what terms Hawker's airframe in- terests will be merged with BAC, therefore, it is difficult to take more than a short-term viqw about the shares. And because it is not doing too well on the civil side, Hawker's aerospace deliveries could fail to advance far over the next two or three years despite these military orders, as John Prust points out in its latest review of the industry. Thus it will be up to Canada and the industrial side to provide the growth in profits. Putting Canada right has proved a very lon job and the end is not yet in sight. As for the U.K. industrial side, the outlook for diesel engines, with a high export content, is brighter than that for the electrical engineering subsidiaries. And if Hawker responds to Ruston and Hornsby's public invitation for further inte- gration in this field it would neatly solve the problem of how to invest the Â£26.65m. proceeds from selling its half of BSE to Rolls. No.orders .Un il these major questions affectlng Hawker's future are sett it is hard to se the shares standig -much h*igher than their cpryistnieveL *'Bt at least Hawker ca -afford to wait for the Govern. ientt to ahe ,up its mind. Not so westlain4 which. as Plowden pollted 6ut, is running out of orders fast. Since then the only announcement has been that an Onspecified number of SH 3-D helicopters (to be made under licence) will be bought by the Ministry of Defence. This must augur badly for profits over the next few years though Normalair's contribution is not to be sneered at just because it is kept dark. Hovercraft, moreover, are likely to be more of a drain on liquidity during their current stage of de- velopment than a source of profits, whatever their long-term potential. Things look quite black, therefore, though Westland is only selling at 10.2 times earnings and profits are forecast to be no lower this year. The only trouble with writing it off as an investment is that both the share price ahd profits have shown an unomany habit of dis. Sregarding gloomy prognostications before pow.

First on the strength of r an excellent order book in which e the Spey is outstanding, deliveries Sin 1969 should be 75 percent. e above the 1965 level Secaiddly . since Rolls engines power roughly half the civil airliners in the West, the production of spares could well Ssoon exceed a lucratie Â£30m. a year. Thirdly by virtue of Ir- chasing BSE it now has importjt technical links with Pratt and Whitney, GE and the main Etio- pean manufacturers. Finally, it is the only direct investment possible Sin aero-engines, since the tWo U.S. Smajors are part of larger groups. SConvertible Premieims Considerable hopes have.been raised that the new Rolls-~oce convertible, to be issue4i 1rat of Sthe consideration for ,i toflA~ plane, will open at par., Cily Dunlop with the same coipoiwi, gone from strength andEowri m mands a premium of :'4 'Ã½5k5 conversion price at par is lessa that of the Ordinary now, whrleas for Rolls it is 9 per cent, hijler. The point to bear in mind is that convertibles can be' valued (ither on. their fixed interest merits or as Sdeferred equity, depending on the relationship between their coupon Sand the conversion terms. There can be a considerable difference be. Stween the two valuations. Thus the GKN 6% per cent Convertible is Sworth only around 80% on its own, to bring its redemption yield up in line with the 8.4 per cent average. But if, it were possible to convert s at once on the first terms of 40 SOrdinary per Â£100 of stock, then . at 46s the equivalent loan price -would be 92:. r Since this ila iac-' eixactly what rthe GN 'Convertible is currently D fetching, it is clear Which method m is crucial here. For the Rank 6* Sper- cet Convertible Loan stock S1988-93, on tehe er hand, the fixed interest value brings one )closer to the market price but is still some 5 points below it. What a seems to be the case is that where tthere is a wide difference-a matter of 10 points or more-between'the two results, then a convertdobl will Sbe priced closely to the higherone. But as they tend to convrg so the market price moves to (re* mium over both of them. Thu 'pre, mlum reaches a peak of 10 to 12 points where the fixed Interest value is just higher than the equi. valent loan price. Now with its 7 per cent, coupon Rolls is worth S93.4 as a loan stock and Its equiva- lent loan price, with the shares at 41s 9d, is 92. It is thus ideally placed to achieve the minimum 3.6 point premium necessary to rach par and could easily open abog it.",

A. C. NEWMAN. Y V.C., O.B.E,. M.I.C.E.: \" Ja my statement last year I pre ceded the summary of our trading operations by some general re marks as to the effect the Govern- Sment's measures were then having. Sand were likely to have in the future, on our trading results. I meant every word I then said and I am afraid that in making some further observations this year I Smust emphasise even more strongly the impact these reasures are having. One thig, that is ncem sary before we can arrive ats aol* tion to the countirys fnanci difi culties-and it as been said manj times-is an increase in producti. ivty, With thib ag our objective we can formulate our policies and make our plans to achieve that end This is the task of Management with the combined efforts of every- one from the top eX4cutive to the newest recruit. However, it can only be achieved in the Construction Industries by the assuralce of the Government Ministriesconcerned of two things, i.e. a planned continuous pro- gramme of work and confidence in the ability of the Industry to carry Plado, by the Miistrie concerned with\" our iadustry to ensure con, tinluty of' wrk have been formu- ulated but these will take some time to become effective. Uncertainty still predominates. As for the confidence that must be mutual between Government'and \"~n stry; credit, restritiosri, high interest rates, overfull employ- prob t; eh idecision con- cerlanig ves tnt Ineentivs, all Sth a clt idepce that Manage- m m~i 4ustry must have to keep dr tiatve at its highest L levei,V :sol d like Shareholdern t kow that we are in a state of readiness to take our full share of work and responsibility in the Construction Industries as soon as the present severe restrictions are lifted. t Trading Resalm In my Report last year I. said Sthat we must expect the conse. Squences of the Government's Smeasures to affect the trading re- suits of the Group for the current year. This was reflected more par. ticularly in the second half of the year's trading when the profit fell from Â£535,000 in the first six months to Â£231,000 in the second half-year. A contributory factor was, of course, the weather which was considerably worse than in the- preceding winter. The final turnover for the year showed a slight decrease compared with 1964/65. This and weather conditions arising from an in- different summer and a wet winter resulted in a decline in the Group Trading Profit before Depreciation and other items from Â£1,579,611 to Â£1,524,362. The final Group Net Profit before taxation showed a reduction from Â£826,498 in 1965 to Â£765,972 for the year under review. From this figure Corpora. tion Tax requires Â£180,000, taxa- tion deferred by reason of Capital Allowances, Profits Tax and Over- seas Taxation require a net figure of Â£33,429. making a total charge for taxation of Â£213,429. This leaves a Group Net Profit after taxation of Â£552,543 as against Â£508.673 last year, an increase of Â£43.870. The Directors recommend the payment of a Final Dividend of 7% on the Ordinary and \"A\" Ordinary Share Capital. When the Special Interim Dividend of 1lI% paid on 31st March last is taken into account, the total Dividend for the year on the Ordinary and \"A\" Ordinary Shares amounts to 8%%. This compares with the equivalent of 81% paid last year when related to the increased Share Capital. In considering the Final Dividend and deciding. to recommend a payment of 7%, the Directors were mindful of the reference to the expected Dividend in the Interim Statement of March last but nevertheless agreed to comply with the Govern- ment's request that dividends should not be increased at this time. Enhanced Stremnth The Consolidated Balance Sheet discloses Issued Share Capital and Capital and Revenue Reserves (i.e. Net Assets) at Â£5.119,978 compared with Â£4,750,402 last year, an in- crease of Â£369,576.

Our Overseas Subsidiary re- Company which was formed last t year and is based in the UK. will v. control future contracts taken he overseas, unless it becomes neces. ell sary to form a locally registered lix Subsidiary Company. In June this nd year we were invited to take over or an existing Contracting organisation ch in Natal, South Africa, and with in this prospect in view and the re- deployment of personnel, plant and ar equipment, from East Africa, we ed formed a new Subsidiary Company, er W. & C. French (South Africa) n- (Pty.) Limited. We have set up an er organisation in South Africa where lp we are at present tendering for )n work. to The Outlook 'et As you will realise profits earned a during the progress of contracts 55 can vary according to the stage ot er work reached at any particular 'a- accounting date and the need to :a- make provisions against contingen- al cies likely to arise before the con- ;r- tracts are completed and the main- re tenance period expires. Thus in ge any accounting period there can be lis a predominance of large contracts er in the ipitial stages or, conversely, Ist a number of completions where the of total profit can be safely taken into account. This latter position arose he in the year ended on 31st March of last and the profits were affected by V\" it. he The present position is that we % have ample work in hand to take en us . through the next financial or period, i.e. the nine months to 31st \"' December, 1966, Beyond that date %. we shall need further large and nt long term contracts in order to feel ed that our future outlook is satisfac- In tory. The immediate future in con- ad tracting is conditioned by the com- nt bined effect of continuously rising ,ul costs and finer profit margins. Our ed liquidity, like that of many comn rnt panics today, will soon be further as depleted by the new Selective Em- -n- ployment Tax and also the Cor- ds poration Tax rules as to the treat- 'is ment of tax on Dividends, annual payments, etc. The new Selective Employment Tax will impost a :ct severe strain on our cash resources nd as only a very small part will be e recoverable. All told. due to the ed Government's restrictive measures n- and penal taxation provisions the ed immediate outlook is not encourag- by ing. We shall, however, brace our- us Continued In next column Continued from preceding column selves to meet these setbacks and the problems that they create in the belief that by determination and by attention to costs and overheads we must inevitably pass out of this period of standstill and frustration into more progressive times. The opportunity is also being taken to look into various aspects of the organisation of the Group in order to consider changes which, if put into effect, will ultimately benefit the Companies and the Share- holders.",

Ssunmary of the ANNUAL REPORTfor the year ended 30TH JUNE 1966 SDurlig the first part of the financial year share prices in the Netherlands -,. e underdownward pressure, so that the usual indices fell by about7 7%. SAt the beginning of 1966 there was a brief recovery, but afterwards the S decline was resumed more strongly than before. The result was that at the end of the period under report, from 1st July, 1965 to 30th June, 1966, Sthe level of share prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was 19% lowerthan it had been at the beginning We found no reason to make any drastic change in our investment policy; this, as it always has been, is guided by long-term considerations. Thus the proportion between the Netherlands and the American part of our portfolio remained practically unaltered; at the close of the financial year our funds were invested 76% in theNetherlands and 24% in North America. SThevalue ofa Vereenigd Bezit van 1894 share of Sis. 50par value, inclusive 1f costs of issue of new shares, was SIs. 101.50 on 30th June, 1966 as against SIs. 123.20 a year before. Allowing for the 4% bonus paid in September, 1965 by capitalisation of reserves, it follows that the value of the share fell by 15% in the course of the financial year. This result is - undoubtedly disappointing, even if the fact is borne in mind that the - overallevel of share prices in the Netherlands fell by the wider margin of 19%. The reason why we did better than this is largely that roughly a -iarter of our portfolio is invested in American stocks. .... ~ I d it ..... A.,,.. t .. .

I am therefore particularly pleasd to be able to report to you that instead ofa fall in profits, for which I think we could in all the circumstances have been forgiven, we have suceeded in finishing the year with the highlat turnover and the highest profits In the Company's history, During the finanial year ending 31st March, 1966. trading profts amountedto o 23,109,000 (compared with Â£20 76s,000 for the year ended 3 lst March, 1965). After deducting depreciation of television sets and other equipment on rental of Â£7,105,000 (6,389,000), depreciation of fixed assets Â£3248,000 (Â£2,679,000) and interest, Â£1.987,000 (Â£1332000), net profit before tax amounted to Â£10C ,8000 (Â£10,268,000), Taxation acounted for Â£3,160 ,00(Â£3,706,OQ) and net profit ater tax amounted to Â£7,388,000 (Â£6 ,62,000), The amount applicable to outside shareholders In Â£1213,000 (Â£1,32,000) leavin not prpfit attribut. able to the Company of Â£6,175 000 (Â£5,430.000), The Directors recommend a Final dividend on the Ordinary and \"A\" Ordinary shares of 15%, making a total dividend for the year of 30% (30%).

In spite of the problems faced by the industry as a whole, I amn glad to say that the measures we took to adjust ourselves to changing conditions - and It was a succession of gales rathlr thian any \"wind or change\" with which we had to cope-. were successful and in comparison with the decline generally expurlenced we were able to Increase our volume both in television and In radio, To have succeeded in doing this in such a dificult year I hope is indicative of our capacity to cope with the future problems which will In- evitably arise Itom the severe dllationary measures recently announced by the Prime Minister, Notable success was achieved In the tape recorder market where In spite of our compara- tively late entry we have already managed to obtain a substantial and rapidly growing share of ttie market. Our now 7\" rel tape recorder recently launched under the Ferguson and HMV marks will further improve our position, Our record player and radiogram activities also showed a considerable increase In turnover and prolutabllity, Export turnover showed a 16% increase on the total ror the previous finnuncal year, well above the natlonal avera e, An to the lonterm future there is obvious growth puotntial in the continuing expansion of BBC2 coverage, the development or, the TV eond set market and, looking further ahead, in colour television, There is also considerable scope for enterprise and innovation in the audio field, I am therefore confident that there is no com. pany better equippld than ours to seie whatever market opportuntlis emerge.

Two new space heaters-the Caribbean Fire and the Ripon Convector--went into production towards the end of the year, We are confident that the market for gas appliances will continue to expand, This view is supported by the recent discovery of abuidant sources or natural gas beneath the North Sea, The increased use of natural gas In the domestic field will bring excellent opportunities for growth. QLOVER AND MAIN LIMITED In my statement to you twelve months ago gave a very brief outline of our new subsidiary Glover and Main Limited, and I have already referred to part of their activities.

However, the situation was improved by our substantial export of tubes and also by a steady demand for radio valves. Semiconductor turnover continued to increase and there was further expansion in the industrial cathode ray tube business. In terms of research and development we have been pre- occupied with development problems arising out of the Government's intention to commence a colour television service in this country in the Autumn of 1967, 19\" and 25\" colour tubes have been designed in preoaration for the new service and an initial production operation is In an advanced stage or preparation which will ensure that the Company will be able -to meet any demand, for colour tubes arising during 1967 and onwards, THORN SPECIAL PRODUCTS LIMITED Thorn Special Products Limited, formerly our special products division, has ngain made a useful contribution to Group turnover and profits, THORN ELECTRONICS LIMITED Thorn Electronics Limited has maintained its technical lead in the fields of spciallised TV studio equipment and wired TV distribution systems, CONCLUSION In view of the recent Government announcement of the further measures which have had to be taken to remedy the finanial crisis which is now facins the country, it is dimcult for me to forecast the present year' results. 1 think our Shareholdero will be aware, however, that our past policy of keeping our eulpmentt up to the most modern standrds, and also the flexibility of our organis- tion will stand us in good stead, and I am connde~t (hat we are In a stronger poslton than most of our competlltors to face the fCuru, THORN ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED Thorn Electrical Industries is a major force In the British electronics industry, with assets currently stand- Ing at over Â£110 million, which have more than doubled over the last three years, In a number of product groups the Company has achieved leadershlp--t ls pre-eminent In lighting, radio and television, and has also attalned a laidlng position In domestic electrlo cookers, In Glover and Main Ltd. the Company has an important atake in gas appllanons quipment, hoating and ventilating fields, It has Important h.

At a Press conference called yes- terday morning to explain the move, Dr. Derek Stevenson, secre- tary of the BMA. explained that as a directly elected and represen- tative body, the association was better fitted to fill this role. The actual negotiations will be done by a reformed and renamed central consultants' and specialists' committee. At the moment this contains seven junior representa- tives among its 85 members. The reformed committee may have as many as 27 to rierescut all the regions into which the BMA is split. GPs Do Better The junior doctors were initially consderably angered by the report ,of the Review Body on Doctor's Pay. Although the most junior ranks will receive substantial pay increases at the end of the year, the hospital service as a whole was not nearly sb well treated as were the general practitoners. Here the BMA had again moved to outflank protests from outside bodies, and presented'a charter to the Minister on conditions of service. Once this was conceded, it was passed o'r -to the review body for pridc g. - ,' Learning froim tW' triumph and experience, the UMA etnis to be planning tb use the same strategy on behalf of the hospital doctors. The first task of the new committee, according to its chairman, will be to draw up a charter for hospital doctors governing such matters as hours of work and time off for study, living and working conditions and so on. The bargaining will come later. Breakaway Groups The haste of the move is probably explained by the fact that one of the breakaway junior doctors' organise tions is at the moment canvassing all junior staffs to see if they are willing to resign from the BMA and form its organisation to negotiate on their own behalf. First reactions from junior doctors suggest that if the BMA's new com- mittee is as good as it sounds, this Ibreakaway movement will fizzle out. Five young specialist doctors in a large general hospital in Glasgow are planning to emigrate because of their dissatisfaction with salaries and con- ditions. One doctor leaving for Canada early next month is Dr. Alan Johnson (30) who recently qualifed as a gynaecologist.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Reporter The National Union of Teachers has decided to seek expert advice about the refusal of some local authorities to pay higher salaries under arrangements settled before the wages freeze started. This move to. clarify the legal position was agreed at a union executive meeting over the week end. It comes at a time when the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians is taking the same issue to the county courts. Some education authorities are withholding increased salaries due 1-*----- -- under arrangements covering teachers who are promoted or take on extra responsibilities. A spokesman for the NUT said: \"The union is convinced that such action is contrary to the expressed intention of the White Paper on the prices and incomes standstill, but it already has reports of a number of local authorities taking the action complained of.\" The executive has also decided to seek a meeting of the teachers' panel of the Burnbam Committee to dis- cuss the position arising from the Prices and Iricomes Act. At the same time. the executiv- reaffirmed its intention to pursue with \"vigour and determination the union's salary aim in negotiations- which, in its views, should commence at an early date-for a new agree. ment to operate from April 1. 1967.\" It was felt that the vital impor- tance of education for the national economy and the grave and critical shortage of t6echers \"without whom educational development was impos. sible\" justified a vigorous pursuit of the union's salary aims.",

This success was the more remarkable in that it required the collabora- tion of manufacturers from seven countries (Britain, France, Ger. many, Belgium, Holland, U.S.A. and Canada).' The prototype phase was com. pleted when Prototypes 01 and 03 were finally received by the French Government on 16th December, 1964.

Series production has begun very satis- factorily and three aeroplanes were being produced per month as re- quird by the contract. It was now considered desirable to reduce the rate of production in order to keep in step with the. possible supplies -of ehgines by. the European Con- sorth)m set up for this purpose and in full agreement with the Navies buying this aircraft. By the time this report was pre- sented, twelve aircraft had been delivered out of a total order of sixty. Delivery of all sixty should, be completed in the middle of 1968 and the Company hoped to receive further orders. S.T.OL Br.941 The initial series of four aircraft were ordered from BREGUET for the French Air Force by a contract signed on 29th November, 1965. The Company remained very con.- Adent that this project had a very good future. Jaguar During the year 1965 the British and French Governments camr to an agreement to produce in common between the two coun- tries a high performance light twin. jet aircraft. This plane would pro. vid tactical support to ground fortos, would be available for advanced training on supersonic airiraft, and would provide tacti- cal support from aircraft carrimt. The project was called \" Jaguar\" and was developed from the BRE. GUET 121. The Company was associated with the British Air. craft Corporation and it already appeared likely that many aircraft would be ordered. Regular service operations were foreseen for 1970 after the completion of tests on six or seven prototypes, of which the first would fly in 1968. The Company wished to stress its satisfaction with its co-operation with British industry which had long been one of its objectives. Airbus The Company had for some years been studying the possibilities of medium-distance aircraft of very high and economic capacity for the nineteen-seventies. The Company was now associated in' the Airbus project with Socid Nord-Aviation in France, and with the Hawker Siddeley Group in Great Britain. These Companies' co-operation would be extended, as in the case of the Atlantic and the Nord-A viation Transall. to German manufacturers. The Company also built fuse- lages for the Fokker Friendship F 27. BREGUET has built for Matra the structure of the DIA satellite which has been launched success- fully on 17th February, 1966 and which has subsequently performed with complete success. It has also taken a shareholding in two Companies for the develop- ment and manufacture of Hover- craft and acrotrains under Berlin patents. Profits and Divldonde Profits before tax for the year 1965 amounted to Frs. 5,379,174 or after tax Frs. 2,997.775 (compared with Frs. 2,456.329in 1964). After Sthe usual credit of 5 per cent. to. .the Legal Reserve, the Board pro* posed to distribute a dividend of 12 per cent. of the face value of the issued shares, namely, Prs. 2.445,000 (compared respectively with 10 per cent. and Frs. 2,037,500). The gross dividend on each share was Frs. 6. The Report, the Accounts and the proposals put forward by the Board of Directors were adopted by the meeting which decided the date and the method of payment of the dividend for 1965.",

   "text_content" : "Prom Our wa C6ima\"pedent SALISBURY..Sept 4. Rhodesians appear to be largely indiferent about tbhi week's Commonwealth Coufenrsmq. CaÃ½oaqk* iN the country's ability to overcome sactiA ir c p hat thase is no great. anxiety about any Ieikfiatio iOf a0\"dMs that Britain might have in mind. i . * Business sources here expect a totleiill-up of danctiQCinsby way of increased aid to Zambia so that there can be an effective severance of its Rhodesian trade links, and a call for mandatory sanctions on some Rhodesian exports. Some sources believe, too, that there will be mandatory provisions to try to prevent the flow of oil to Rhodesia through Mozambique. Mr. B. M. Musett's announce- ment of further relaxation in import controls is, of course being interpreted as a reflection of im- provement in Rhodesia's external payments position. But observers point out that the demand for imports has fallen away to such an extent that the Government is in a position to widen its range of goods allowed in. t Over the last few days there has been renewed speculation about the tobacco position, with reports circu- lating in* Salisbury about the Government-controlled Tobacco Cor- poration's drive to find new storage facilities for unsold leaf. It has become clear. too, in recent weeks that petrol rationing itself is not curbing consumption so much as the high foreign exchange cost, on the one hand, and consumer resist- ance to the high domestic price, on the other. It is suggested that a gal- lon of petrol is costing Rhodesia 7s against a domestic retail price for premium fuel of 6s. Despite difficulties in relation to agriculture generanly-end eecWlaly tobaeco and augur-the motort W try (which does ,not know whM t wili draw ssembly units froit when it runs out of accumulated stocks around Christmas), some sections of industry hit by lost Zambian markets, and retailers whose sales are said to be some 12 per cent. lower than a year ago, the economy is faring re- markably well. One estimate is that the reduction in activity here since sanctions were imposed has only been between 10 and 15 per cent. overall; six months ago most observers here were estimat- ing a 25-30 per cent. decline. It is for this reason that Rhodesians believe they can hang on and win. The political implications. of the Commonwealth gathering may be much more significant. One school of thought here argues that this week will see the fragmentation of the Commonwealth, which would soon be followed by the recognition by Britain and the older white States of Rhodesia's independence. Another view is that any Commonwealth attack on Rhodesia will generate renewed demands for the declaration of a republic here and the breaking of al ties with Britain.",

A progress report on the prices standstill says about 350 letters from the public have been received to date about higher charges for a wide range of itemns, including laundry, .cheiiuts' :-goods; toys, greeting -cards,' knitting needles, footwear, records, and hotel rooms. \"In some cases, where a price increase was made after July 20, this has now. been withdrawn or is being reconsidered,\" adds .the Board. In a number of other cases it has. been found that the higher prices are duetto:the 10per. cent. incease in purchase tax which wai announced in July, \" In the case of some stores,-where it is impracticable. to apply purelase tax increases on goods; prd yrat prices have been increased seleciely. on certain goods only to give the same total result\" There isUan Indication that the Board of .Trade ima have second thoughts about .higher laundry phalges, to which no objection appears to have been iven when they were recently notified; A report on laundry charges is due to be pub- lished later this week and the Board \"iptends to discuss its reconmenda- tions with the laindry industry.\" There have been: criticisms of re cent announcements about dearer dry cleaning and laundry charges, in ad. vance. of'this report. In its drive to hold downa trices. the, Board has so far been in touch with' more than 200 trade associations representing manufacturing, as well 'as with individual companies. about implementing the prices standstill. \"Meetings have been held with many of them, and further meetings are planned.\" adds the Board's pro. gress report. Departmentat officials have ber intouch. too. with the main ' .organisations representing wholesalers' ad. etailers, finance houses, newsagents, and hotels.",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-05",
   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent PARIS, Sept. 4. The ten-months-old Ben Barka scandal takes on a new lease of life Stomorrow at the opening of the trial of six men accused of conm iplicity in the kidnapping and supposed murder of the Moroccan Sleft-wing opposition leader in the heart of Paris. Mebdi Ben Barka was kidnapped - at Saint Germain des Prbs on October 29 last year, and although his body has never been found he is presumed to have been, killed. According to the evidence which emerged 4uring the investigation by the examining maistrate, the inde- fatigable Judge Zollinjer, 'it appears probable that the kidnapping took place on orders from Rabat, and pos. sibly with the personal participaion of General Mohammed Oufkir, Moroccan Interior Minister. Apart from this violation of French territorial sovereignty, the investiga- tion also revealed that French secret service and police agents were in- volved in the kidnapping. Some of the evidence suggested the possibility of French complicity, or at least non- interference, may have gone very high in the official hierarchy. The accused who will be' present at to-morrow's trial, however, are only the bit players it the drama: Antoine Lopez. a Moroccan em. ployed by Air France who.was .also *working for the French Secret Ser- vice as well no doubt as for the Moroccan authorities; Louis Sou- chon and Roger Voltot, two police officers alleged to hve actuall kid napped Ben Barka; and El Chal el Mahi, a Moroccan student said to have witnessed the event, and lhlllln Rsmiar. a itmmiUlt.a 'Pili-Benir- aY-Â· i-ruslist. Also on trial, Iut only for the lesser charge of failing to report a crime, is Marcel Le Roy, a former investigation chief in the French Secret Service. The main interest at the trial will, therefore, be the evidence which is thrown up against General Oufkir on the one hand or against senior French officials on the other. The Govern. ment faces the risk that the trial will provide fresh ammunition for the Opposition parties in this pre-election period. What at this stage is quite un- predictable is how clearly the respon. sibility for the kidnap g wll be pinned on General Outkir. The French have nade repeated diplomatic representations to Rabat, but King Hassan has ostentatiously paraded his continued attachment to his Minister of the Interior. At one stage it seemed possible ,that the French would take retaliatory measures against Morocco. If the trial opening to-morrow should lead to a public condembation of General Ouflcr, either legally or morally, it is. psible that the retaliatory mea. sure will o-'me from Rabat instead, These could include moves against the 100,000 Frenchmen still living in Morocco and the extensive interests still controlled by French banks and other businesse ---",

' dbpnplq and exhibition which opem bIene tomorrow. . These include a new aero engine by RollsRoyce,. called the STent, which is a possible power plant for the projected Hawke: . Siddeley HS-136. a new design for a short-hau airliner seating up to 40 passengers. Another possible power plant is the Bristol Siddeley M45 series of engines. :-.. The. Trent is derived from what SRolls-Royce calls its \"advanced S technology\" research into aero .en Sines for the future. So far, this engine is only a design study, but t, te company plans to build it as and when a market appears. Engines at Rear This- market may well be found overseas, in both the U.S. and Japan; where various new civil and military aircraft are now in the design stages which could be suit able for an aero engine of this size -over 9.000 lbs thrust. The Hawker Siddeley HS-136 air liner project now appears to be gatherig strength. A model showint W' .... e aircraft ight aopear is bein exhibited on the company's gtand here at the air display. It is a twin-engined aeroplane with the power plants set at the rear of the fuselage, as is the custom with most moder airliner designs. Although no formal decision to go ahead with It has yet been taken by Hawker Siddeley, the project falls neatly into the current spectrum of short haul airliners, between the small West German VFW.614 and the larger Fokker F-28 Fellowship airliner, and Hawker's studies are believed to show a potential market for several hundred aeroplanes. The possibility of the HS-136 being launched with some of the Â£28m. that Hawker Siddeley will receive from the sale of its share in Bristol Siddeley Engines to Rolls-Royce can not be overlooked, but it must be stressed that no decisons on the future of this project have yet been taken.

In the meantime, another new aeroplane which shows considerable promise is being unveiled here this week. This is the light two-seat Beagle 121 \"Pup,\" which is designed for personal and private buyers. This aircraft is a new addition to the grow. ing range of light pesonal and sport. ing types with which Beagle Aircraft hopes to break the American mono. polv in Europe. During the coming week. when a record number of over 11,000 foreign visitors are expected at Farnborough. the- industry is likely, to announce some new orders for existng types of aircraft, such as the HS-74 feeder- liner and the HS-125 executive jet. Concord Orders? tLis also known that some major new contracts for the Anglo-French Concord supersonic aiiliner are in the ofing, particularly from the U.S. and some of these may be revealed during the coming week; This could well strengthen the underlying major theme of the 'show this year-international collaboration. For the first time several major foreign aircraft with British engines and equipment are appearing, such as the Breguet Atlantic maritime recon- naisance and the Franco-German Transall transport. * Most leaders of the industry to whpm I spoke. here today are con- sident that m this kind of international co-6peration lie a stronger future for the British industry than is generally realised at present, and they hope to be able to stress publicly their ready acceptance of it-during the coming week.

SAs far as the first is concerned. the position is usually reasonably clear from the start, although the merits ofthe whole ituation may be confused. Two partis (limited com- pany traders, for xanmple) quarrel, and one of them takes the matter to court. * : \"The .loserl i. forbidden by the judgeto continue poaching the good- will of the other, by teli unfair use of an imitated. trade. njme, style. of presentation, or even by an entry in the telephone directory. Rather than eat about informing allhis customers, and incur the numerous other ex- penses of change, the loser carries on much as before. \"It is now not only a civil wrong to the other party which he is com- mitting, but also the graver offence of direct disobedience of an order of the court. The assets of the offending trader may be seized, and, if a company is concerned, the directors may be committed to prison.\" More difficult is the position of the company director whose company has ben sered with an order under the Restrictive Practices Act. \"There may have been as many as several hundred companies concerned together in a price-fixing agreement which was, until 1956 .quite legal in this country. Not all the lawyers understood the effects of the Act for some time. and industrialists cap hardly be blamed if they make mis- takes now.. \"The fact remains that if they attempt to resurrect condemned agreements. or reach an understand. ing to the like effect' as those which have been condemned, then the directors themselves will not only be called upon to account for the actions of their company, but will also be held liable personally. \"Moreover, it is not enough for a director to refrain from disobeying the court order.

If the unions reject the Prime Minister's apeal4 they will be abdicating from the retpopsi- bility, (which they. have deliberately sought in the past) of sharing in the formulation of the country's economic polcies Some union leaders, like Mr. Cousins, may prefer a free-for- all, but many others believe that it is right for the trade union movement, and the TUC in par- ticular, to cooperate with the Government-whichever pa ty happens to be in power-in its attempts to improve the per formance of the economy. li naturally follows from this be- lief that unions and their memr- bers cannot pursue their in- dividual objectives with complete disregard for the interests of the country as a whole. Some re- straints on their freedom of action have to be accepted. But co-6peration with the Government is only meaningful if the unions have enough control over their members to make it.effective. In a varety of industries the national union leadert are totally out of touch with their rank and.file; this is partof the reason for uncontrol- lable wage drift and innumerable udoflIal strikes. Unldte this situation is, put right the; TUC itself.will become an increasingly 'irtelevant body. Policy-making A strong TUC, like a strong CBI, should have a very impor- tant .unction to perform. An influential, role in policy-making is not indbmpatible wit effective Saction by individual unions on behalf of their members. But at the present time the iove- Simept is anything but strgqg, - prtly because of bad intefal o'rpgisation, partly because 6f lack'of clarity, as to what its objectives really are. The crisis which has now developed in relations between the TUC and the GOvernment should provide Sa salutary shock, forcing the unions to undertake the reform of their own affairs for which the cbuntry has been waiting far too lonlg.",

But these, like some of the statibn's other prestige ,effort (Weavers: Green, Survival, Who Were the Brtitih?) havd been costly ventures. \" You have to be seen to be wearing a clean shirt when you appear In society,\" said the programmes controller, Mr. Peter HO6mans. BEven when this mote am- bitious approach is adopted, the small stations are still cast in the same role as local news- papers. As soon as their staff are dry behind the ears, they are poached away by the biger organisations which can ofer them stniething more creative on which to cut their teeth. It even happens at senior manage ment level: Mr. Robin Gill, who started Border Television, went to ATV two years ago as deputy managing director.' These two problems, a sort- age of money and the difficulty of holding on tostaff, loo large in the thinking of the smaller regional stations. The whole point about the plan for making documentaries on a ec operative basiis s that it is an attempt to nt round them.

On t the other hand, there is resent- d ment in most companies outside 0 the.big'four that when a good , programme is produced in the n regions it is hard to get it on the h nattional screen, and very diffi- Scult indee4 to get it on in peak d viewing hours.. The reason is e not hard to find. There used to n be much more inter.company H co-operation on programmes be. e fore the pygaies of the business r, agreed to pay the giants Â£3m. o a year to provide the bulk of ir their ptogrammes.

The.budget for the four films is Â£30,000 but that includes the salaries of Hum and his staff, and the cost of running an office. Each film will cost nearer Â£5,000 with no hidden charges. Probably rather more than a third will go on the director, his iirsonal assistant, the crew, and travel and subsistence costs, a third on stock, processing and editing, and the remainder on the script and performers. \" The idea,\" said Mr. Huna, \"was to make better programmes and give the people on the stations the chanc to' work on pro. gramies which they would not otherwise be able to. This gives the small companies are getting value for money. I even heard one executive complain this week that ITV was losing the initiative when it continued to put out No Hiding Place, Take Your Pick and Double-Ydq .Money (all 10 'years 'ld) in competiton with a Sfast-changing BBC format. But there has to be an arrangement of that sort because withdut a guaranteed source of pro. grammes the small companies cannot exist. The question is more one of whether or not the formula ought to be changed. As the position is to-day, a com. pany that has paid out a major part of its annual revenue to the majors for the privilege of taking their shows has to be convinced that a programme offered by one of its smaller neighbours is demonstrably better before it will consider screening it. How. ever, the four most junior com. panies (excluding Channel) have shown a fresh Initiative. It could be the start of a revitalised ITV if other stations are prepared to co-operate In the same way.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Labour Reporter BLACKPOOL, Sept 4. UNOFFICIAL TALKS are to take place at this week's Trades Union Congress between the Electrical Trades Union and the National SUnion of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics and Electrical Workers, usually known as the \"powermen.\" The two unions are thinking of merging, and if this happens it will have an important effect on wage negotiations in both the electricity supply and coal industries. The wermen have strong struc- tural links with the Transport and iEC', etal Workers' Union, but the ':Wlauonship between the two has; ' 'bÂ·en strained of late. The power . Sin, for instance, are in favour of \"tt. * Oovenment's wa fIeee, . sli tlhe IGWU is, of coutAb -a inst. :Favoqeable Mood Considerable technical difficulties -face the merger talks, but the ETU I:i in a mood to make concessions, ' because the merger would substan. tially increase its Importance in electricity supply 'and make it a fore to be reckoned with in the co ahlnlns Industry. Wle in electrical contracting thiVU is dominant, In electricity ., upply tOnGeeral and Municipal W kera' Union, the Amalgamatd Bngiaterina Union, the TOWU and the powermen have an in. terest. An amalgamation with the powermen would give the ETU a high proportion of the craftsmen in the power stations. The ETU has just under 300,000 members, and the powermen about 30,000. The ETU has some members in the coalmining industry, but no negotiating rights with the National Coal Board. The power- men are recognised by -the NCB, and have representation on the National Union of Mineworkers' executive. The advantages for the ETU could, therefore, be consider- able, in the coalmining Industry. ompromise Plan ene al secretary, Is on the pomt of retiring. Powermen's oflfcals are appo;nted for life. as in the TOWU, whereas in the ETU they come up for reelection every five years, One compromise that has been mooted is .that all the powermen's full-time ocials should be allocated lobs in -the new organiation, and that they shtuld be considered as just starting a fiveyear term of aofie. It s unusual f6r a sitting ofAlal to be rejeted at an electon, but if this did happen to an ex-powermen's official the new organisaton would be willing to guarantee that defeat at the poll would not mean loss of employment, since a job could be offered on the office staff.",

The payment of Â£1lm. in selective employment tax, which starts to-day, the economic squeeze, and the prospect of up to Â£13m. being added to the movement's wages bill in the coming year or so have forced management committees to overhaul S a II I' a a a. year or so have forced mana operations without further delay It is likely that the seriousness of the co-op's trading position, which had shown some sins of improvement in 1965, will be stressed by next month's half-yealy statement from the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which supplies retail societies through Englahd and Wales. Among the immediate measures being urged on retail societies' man- agement committees by the Co- operative Union, which has just sent out a special statement of advice, are:- 1--Ab6Iiton of grocery dell* veries or, if they must be main- .tined, the imposition of aspecal, hatrge avetagf\" s 14'p ordeK. \" S--Sbuttin d-own branches and services which do not pay their v!-\"Rationalisation of warehous- ing to effect reductions in costs and reduce excessive stocks. 4--Raising tih ratio of female employees since male shopworkers mean bigger SET payments. S-Reduction of administrative expenses by the reorganisation of central office staffs. Plea to Premier As feared by the co-ops, which protested in a campaign that In volved personal representations to the Prime Minister and the Chanr cellor, the burden of SET is prompting the most stringent economy measures ordered by co-op boards since the war. And it looks like prompting or accelerating a series of major mergers, or joint working, be. tween neighbouring societies It was announced on Friday that the 'Watford ociety wants to transfer' its engagements to London and attempt, are being made to merge Basingstoke with the successful Portsea Island Society. A form of joint working it, it understood i. being put forwaid in the Yosh region following dippointing trading results from te Leeds Society. One of the largest societies in the ountry, South Suburban, is currently developing joint working arrangements with the highly effiient Royal Arsenal, A merger is not ruled out..

However, the movement's major programme of redevelopment has put resources under a heavy strain and many societles are having to reduce commitments. Burnley Society will, for example, close shortly 40 per cent. of its shops and convert remaining grocery branches Into Crazi Cutz\" stores without the co-op symbol. Mr. Tom Taylor, president of the. Â£90m. Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, declares: \"I believe that the next 12 months will be the most critical in the history of the co-operative move. ment.

Pay Agreement Early in 1965 Olympic Air. ways, the Greek Airline owned by Mr. Onassis, concluded a four-year collective bargain agreement with the union con- cerned. The agreement received the blessing of the Greek Gov- ernment, which confirmed it by Royal Decree: In July of this year the Greek pilots' union pressed for a wa*e increase on the grotud .that the cost of liv- ing had gone. up so fast as to invalidate the basis of the wage agreement. The pilots claimed that there had been an 18 per cent. increase in the cost of liv- ing, while the airline retorted that the increase had been only 14 per cent. The company pro- mised, however, to give the unions a final answer to the claiin on August 16. For some unexplained reason the Greek pilots thought that the company was deliberately dragging its feet, and so pre- maturely brought its members out on strike. The Greek unions then contacted the International Transport Workers Federation and the International FederationÃ½ of Airline. Pilots Association seek- ing. union solidarity outside oreece. The English unions affiliated to the. ITWF gave instructions to. their piembers to withdraw airport facilities (mainly the. maintenance of Olynpic Airways' aircraf) at London.

Forty-five years ago two, outstanding appeal court judgeshad said that this meant that injunctions 'against trade unions.canopt be given even for apprehe d ,wrong- ful action. Tley said that the words \"alleged to have been committed\" must include alle- gations, that trade unions are about to commit tortious acts. Boulting Case A few years ago when those famous twins of the cinema in dustry, the Boulting Brothers. went to law against the Asso ciation of Cinematograph, Tele vision and Allied Technicians: some doubt was cast on that view, and subsequently at least one High Court judge has act- ally granted an injunction against a union for anticipated u .unlawful acts. This-ticklish issue remains unresolved, and the settlement of the Greek pilots' strike has avoided a resolution for the time being. When the full hearing of Olympic Airways' application for an injunction came before Mr.Justice Orr on Tuesday, and the defendants had .their first opportunity to argue their case, the judge was clearly impressed -although he delivered only a formal judgment - with\" the older established authority that' no injunction would ll in any But even.. moi A od of trater union ,' lthe â¢ e ht whatt .i M'not WllÂ·r at' the .union ,yi the aircraft :hadi - in the .contduct busiaos. u is. oW t the immunity frt ttends oily to in pursuanqe of :a to with 'breachti of employmsnt a Disputes Act 1965 ' offect of.

Olympic Airways -also advanced a novel and poten- tially important argument. They pointed to the fact that under Greek law the strike had become unlawful because the airline had referred the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, the effect of which was to make any strike action, by union and member alike, a criminal offence. They argued, there- fore, that the conduct of the English unions could not be \" in furtheranceati, ' de dispute.\" The-ed to accept the dee d- ment that a tradelVi. did Aot cease to be mtch btc se in Greece it was crimt to t6 .on strike, and in an nt .English law would e to enforce, even indrectly\" ,_e penal laws of :a so eign country.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF :..-A1111 VVE.LJ* % Keenly' awaited this week is the stateient due qn Thursday from ICI, reportin. on the second quarter's trading experi. ence and it is hoped, offering someuidance on the likely out- cost6 of the full year. Among ,the other companies with interim annouioements are Steetey and Ti.sptrt Development (to- morrow), Kelzer Venesta and Gamage (Wednesday) and A,! and IODH Group (Thursday). Due to report on the full year are 'lacwood Morton (to-day), STap and Die (to-morrow), James Howden (Wednesday) and Winget Gloucester (Thursday). W. & C. French Weather conditions and restric tive measures took their toll of W. and C. French's profits in the second half of last year, and the report suggests that the current nine-month period is unlikely to be much better. The impact of restrictions- is emphasised \"even more strongly\" and the fact that last year's profits were affected by a predominance of completions is hardly encouraging. Turnover was slightly reduced and the pre-tax total was only 7, per cent. down -at Â£766,000, but this could be mis- leadin. Although there is \"ample\" work for the current period, thereafter further contracts will be needed to ensure an adequate flow. No figure is given for SET, but since net indebtedness has risen steeply to Â£588,000, liquidity is going to be under strain. But at least on last year's profits the 8% per cent. dividend (against an effective 8Â¼ per cent.) is well. covered. In these accounts,.the tax ratio is reduced to 27.9 per cent. by various allowances, but even on a straight 40 per cent. basis, earn- ings provide cover of 2.1 times. Selling at only 6% times earnings at 23s, the shares are well prepared for tough conditions ahead, and yield 7.2 per cent. Mather & Platt A month ago Mather and Platt's decision to pay no further interim dividend beyond the 1 per cent. paid for tax reasons at the begin- ning of April set the Â£1 Ordinary back 3s 6d to 21s, from which they have since edged up to 22s 3d. To-day's interim report adds a small measure of encouragement in s that it looks for 166 profi to y excepd those of 196 (wan thre was a setback from Â£1,15m. to. Â£772,000 before tax) but, leaves wide opn the question f what final dividend sharebodrs may * expect to receive. With Â£38 I earned in the first six month, i virtually half of 1965's level has Salready been attained and the second half normally brins in the Sgreater part of the years total subject, of course, to contract con- pletions. S But the difficulty is that some- r thing better than 1965's profits is . needed merely to cover the reduced a 10 per cent. paid for that year. 1 since on a corporation tax basis it was fractionally short-earned. And Mather and Platt's tight financial position puts a premium on ploughing-back. At end-December last. despite the issue during 1965 f of Â£2m. debenture stock, net bank e overdrafts and acceptance credits a had run out to Â£1.75m. in financing t some Â£12m. of stocks and work. ) Until the Board can give a clearer f indication of dividend policy the a shares are unlikely to move much t farther. s Provident Clothing SWhile mail order provides the a most obvious example of con- .venient credit trading during the s squeeze, frovident Clothing ad t Supply is proving the worth of the s iheck and voucher method. In the a half-year statement, there is a men- tion of continuing difficult condi- s tions, but so far the company has ), dealt with these very well-pre-tax r profits for the half-year show an 8f2 per cent. rise to Â£751.000. The Space of business quickens towards t Christmas and the greater part of 1 profits is earned in the second half. so the Board looks on firm ground in expecting the total to exceed Sthe Â£1.95m. earned last year. This is after all charges. includ- ing interest on the new Â£2%m. Sloan stock and SET (about L Â£50,000), and although this year I the same 18% per cent. dividend is to be maintained on capital as in- creased by the recent 1-for-12 rights issue, the dividend outlook is even brighter; If it were not for the a squeeze, the company would be , paying a minimum of 20 per cent 4 Assuming profits only stand still i. -which seems unlikely-cover y would be around 1.2 times and the y shares would be on a 6.7 per cent.

At June 30, unexecuted orders stood one-third higher at Â£198,000; anld though. there was evidently some slackening of activity in the home market with orders up 7.8 per cent..(against 8.1 per cent. at 'April last), exports weighed in with a 6.4 per cent. increase, against 5.6 per cent., which suggests that the group is at least maintaining its 30 per cent. export ratio. But the profits picture is less happy. In the half-year the position has been barely maintained with pre*tax profits of Â£198,000 against Â£200,000 in the corresponding period and Â£216,000 in the second half of 1965. Even a record level of production, it seems, has failed to balance the rise in costs to which the chairman drew attention in his last review. Shareholders will hope that the new factory extension com- pleted last July, with other re- arrangements, will lower costs and improve efficiency sufficiently to retrieve the position and help Nu- Swift regain its \"growth\" image. The present forecast is that \"more than adequate\" profits will be earned in the second half to justify maintenance of the final dividend (the interim is unchanged in defer- ence to the freeze); the 37% per cent. total was qovered more than twice last time. Now 6s 71d. the shares yield 5.6 per cent. with a P/E ratio of 7.9:1.",

   "text_content" : "All told, due to official restrictions and \"penal\" tax provisions, the immediate outlook for W. and C. French is not encouraging, says chairman Mr. A. C. Newman in his annual statement There is at present ample work to take the group through its next period of nine months to end-1966, but beyond then further large and long-term contracts are needed. Mr. Newman stresses- that the immediate future in contracting is conditioned by continuously rising costs and finer margins. Liquidity Strain Liquidity, he adds, will soon be further depleted by the jobs tax- which will impose a severe strain as only a \"very small\" part will be recoverable-and treatment of tax on dividends etc. Year-end net current assets were only Â£152,330, refecting outlay on capital assets-but this additional investment has added \"overall strength\" to the group. The chairman emphasises even more strongly this year the'effect the Government measures are having, and points out that uncertainty- \"still predominates\" in the industry. However, he says, the group is in a state of readiness to take its full share of work and responsibility in the construction industries as soon as the present severe restrictions are lifted. The opportunity is being taken to look into various aspects of group organlsations in order to consider changes which, if effected, will be of ultimate benefit. Effecta n rtha variniÂ¢ r.n';rlm me measures were reflected more par. ticularly in the second half of the year to March 31' 1966. when pre-tax profit fell to Â£231,000 from Â£535,000 in the first six months. The final turnover showed a slight decrease and this, with adverse weather conditions, resulted in the drop in profits from the previous year's Â£826,498. As known, the divi. dend is 81 per cent. (equivalent 81 per cent.) in compliance with the Government's request for no increases. With minor exceptions all the departments and subsidiaries operated profitably while, at the same time, providing essential services to the parent's contracting operations. Due to external influences condi- tioning work in East African terri. tories, it was decided to run down the organisation and withdraw from the Nairobi base-the overseas subsi. diary formed last year and based in the U.K. will control future contracts taken overseas unless necessary to form a local subsidiary.

A wide range of garment.. including day dresses, cocktail dresses, skirts and slacks. Is designed and distributed to U.K. retailers and abroad under the trade names \"Maxlim\" and \" onna Gay.\" Materials for the garments are cut by Maxwell but the making-up is done by sub. contractors. Emphasis has been concentrated on overseas markets in the past two years; exports now account for, around 20 per cent. of sales and are expected to grow further.

Then. followin upgrading in the quality of materals ued. profits shot up to Â£64,000 last year; this reflects sharp improvement in margins for turnover rose only some 18 per csnt, For the current year to end- November next a profit of about Â£70,000 is estimated, together with a dividend of 4 per cent. How- ever, the annual dividend rate on the basis of theie profits,, is fore- cast at not less than 14 per cent., .- covered I Y times. Thus at the placing price the prospective yield and P/E ratio would be 7 per cent. and 9.5:1.

On the other hand, the record is good and Maxlim is a leader in its field. And there is always the possibility of absorption by a larger concern at a later date. although this question rests with the directors, who remain si con- trol of 60 per cent. of the Â£200,000 one-class issued capital.

Unlike the former, however, Corn Pro; ducts is already quoted throughout Europe, with listings on the Amster- dam, Basle, Geneva, Lausanne, Paris and Zurich bourses. U.K. Activity Present U.K. investment partici- pation in the group is presumably very small; but its products manu- factured by the Brown and Poison subsidiary are well known and in- clude branded lines such as Patent Cornflour, Mazola Corn Oil. Knorr Cubes, Frank Cooper marmalade and preserves and Gerber Baby Foods. In fact Brown and Poison is now the second largest subsidiary outside the U.S.; and the introduc- tion of the 50.50 Common shares- there are over 22.3m. in issue---is largely in recognition of this.. The group has seven plants in this country which also manufacture a wide range of industrial products including glucose syrup, dextrose,/ starches and edible oil, etc. A large development programme is planned for next year at Paisley to expand Brown and Poison's capacity, while arrangements are in hand to in- crease its corn grinding plant at Manchester. Apart from two slight setbacks in 1959 and 1964, the group's net income has shown steady growth during the last decade. An there was a further increase of 8 per cent. to $27m. in the first six months of the current year over the com-%1 parable period of 1965, following an 8.7 per cent. rise to almost $503m. in overall sales. Dealings are due to start to-day, but as is usual with introductions of American companies, activity is likely to be small at best. The U.K. equivalent price is around Â£17 7s 3d, allowing for the dollar premium. while yield on an indi- cated $1.60 dividend is only 3.3 per cent.

   "text_content" : "it would hardly be surprising if, due to the sheer volume of new debentures, the fixed interest market was suffering from a severe bout of indigestion. But this stage has not yet been reached for the market appears to be quite firm. On the other hand there is little doubt that both private and institutional investors are being fairly selective. This can be seen with the two current placings for Sears Engineering and W. H. Smith and Son (Holdings). The former. although admittedly 5 times larger that the Smith issue, is offering over a quarter of a point more but it is a matter for conjecture at this stage whether or not the market will take the second call. Sears Engineering The Â£10m. 8X per cent. deben- ture stock 1987.92 of Sears Engin. sering has been placed at Â£99 per cent. through Hill Samuel with brokers Joseph Sebag and Co. Dealings in the Â£25 paid form are expected to start on Thursday and the probable opening price will be around par. At the placing price flat and final redemption yields ar- Â£8 6s 8d per cent, and Â£8 6s Id per cent. respectively. Cover as to prin. cipal Is over 2/ times while that for interest is 4% times based on the annual average profit of the past three years. Interest dates are March 6 and September 6 with a first payment of Â£2 12s 9d per cent. due next March. Final redemption is at par on March 6, 1992, but a non-cumulative sinking fund of Â£125,000 p.,a will be in operation from 1971.72. INer proceeds ot the issue will be used to repay indebtedness to the parent company, Sears Holdings. which amounted to Â£9.4m. at July 30, and to reduce bank indebted- ness-Â£1.4m. at the same date. The group has been reorganised by the acquisition from Sears Holdings of Scottish Motor Traction, which owns SMT Sales and Service and Shaw and Kilburn. Furness Ship- building has been transferred to Sears Holdings, but not its sub- sidiaries Peter Johnston (South Shieldi) and Shaw and Mclnnes. W. H. Smith Baring Brothers, with brokers Cazenove and Co. has handled the placing of the Â£2m. 8 per cent. Redeemable Debenture stock. 1987. 1992, at par for W. H. Smith and Son (Holdings). The stock was readily absorbed and the chances are that a premium of Y to 1 point will be seen when dealings start (Â£50 paid) on Thursday. Interest is payable half-yearly, January 6 and July 6, with a first instalment, of Â£4 18s 10d per cent. due next July. Final redemption is at par on January 6, 1992, but there will be a non.cumulativo sinking fund of Â£20,000 per annum commencing 1971-72. Assets cover is 5.8 times and interest cover basdd on the annual average profit for the past three years. is more than 12\\ times, Proceeds of the Issue will be applied partly in repaying the bank overdraft-Â£1.2m. at August 22-and partly towards tlh con. tinued modernisation and expan. sion of the business, with emphasis on the retail side.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent WORTHING, Sept. 4. Airline pilots of the future could select, at the press of a but- ton, an approach to each of the major-hazard airports of the world. To-day, five top aviation and electronic experts met in Sussex to suggest putting forward a scheme to the Government whereby pilots could train on an airport simulator. This would provide every flying condition on approaching an air- port, but the pilots would not leave the ground. This, they be- lieve, could prevent the repetition of major air disasters such as the Britannia crash at Ljubljana. Pioneer aviator. Mr. Frederick Miles said: \"I believe that a system of training pilots in approaching every major airport would reduce the incidence of accidents.\" The plan is an extension of the pre- sent flight simulation system already in use by major airlines and the RAF. It would entail the production of about 50 detailed scale models of air- ports and their approaehesall over the world. These would be scanned by a tele. vision camera system and the pilot would see in colour the exact landing conditions of the particular airport he was approaching. If the go-ahead is given by the Ministry, the experts believe that the airport simulation scheme could be a reality in two years at a cost of only Â£600,000. excluding buildings.",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN THERE ARE opportunities for owners of moderate horses to pick up small prizes at Folkestone or Warwick this afternoon, and pos- sibly the best bet at Folkestone Is Cute 'in the Dymchurch Plate (2.15) for three-year-olds which have not been placed first, second or third up to the time of starting. Cutle, a filly by Saint Crespin III, out'of a mare by Donatello II, has only' run twice, and on the second occasion finished fifth behind Ace King, Grande Marque. and Camus at Newbury. A reproduction of that form must surely give her a great chance here. Red Kite, trained locally by J Bartholomew at Southfieet. is a useful kind of filly who showed up well for a long way behind Malolica at Goodwood last month. Unless there is a good newcomer in the field she looks to be the probable winner of the Rye Stakes (3.15). Coolroy, a winner over course and distance at each of the last two meetings here, may com- plete a hat-trick by taking the Littlestone Handicap; and Array, though a disappointing animal, can at least be relied on to stay the distance of the Castle Maiden Plate (4.15). .At Warwick, Red Quill, though she has not lived up to the promise she showed last year when finishng close up third to Greengage and Aurianda for the Ebbisham Stakes at Epsom, ought to be capable of winning the Hatton Stakes (4.0); and On Probation, with Piggott in the saddle, appears to be the pick of the runners for the Leamington Plate (4.30). Medlla, an attractive filly by Mileslan, whose two-year-olds are doing so well this season, Is likely to be too good for Piggott's mount. Field Mouse, in the Klneton Plate (3.0); and Drumlanrti, though he ran disappointingly at the York Ebor meeting. Is not harshly treated with 8 st 1 Ib in the Warwick Handicap (5.0) Judged on performances earlier in the season,",

   "text_content" : "From Oar Own Correspondent DERBY, Sept. 4. Britain's miners are being asked to choose the colliery where they would like to work, in an effort to boost production at 50 key pits where 7,400 men are needed. Announcing this scheme, the NCB said miners at exhausted or uneco nomic pits would be given the choice of where they wanted to transfer in a nationwide \"pick your pit\" cam paign. Specially trained employment officers have been drafted in to give individual miners advice on homes shools and shops near long-life col lieries, and the NCB chairman, Lord Robens. will send a personal letter to each miner explaining the plan. Before each old colliery is due to close one of five new \" employment vans\" will call to advise miners and their families on new jobs. Each miner will be givenn n allexpens - paid trip to the pit he has chosen to see whether he wants to work there. The 'new scheme has been launched after a survey of 8,000 miners who had transferred to new pits reveal-e that 20 per cent. did not settle in happily, mainly through misunder- standing of what the jobs and local surroundings offered.",

Unaudited profits for the half-year after making all known provisions, but before charging taxation or providing for dividends, amounted to Â£750,549 against Â£692,313 for the same period of 1965. It is again emphasised that it is in the nature of the busi- ness that a considerably greater proportion of the Company's profit is earned in the second half of the year. Since 30th June, the Company has raised additional long-term working capital, of nearly Â£3.5 million by way of Â£2.5 million Unsecured Loan Stock placed at par and a Rights issue of Ordinary shares. These arrangements should satisfy the Company's requirements for some time to come. The Directors re-affirm their confidence that, in spite of continuing difficult conditions, the profit for the current year ending 31st December, 1966, will be in excess of that for last year. An interim dividend on account of 1966 of 5% (same as last year) was paid in March, 1966, along with the 1965 final. But for the present \"dividend freeze\" a second interim dividend would have been paid in October, 1966. In the circumstances, however, the Directors feel themselves to be confined to a \"same again final\" (i.e., 13~% making-18Y% for the year), payable in March uext year. If before then the freeze is modified or withdrawn, the Directors would expect to pay a final of not less than 15% to make a minimum of 20% for the year. I To the shareholders of: Mather & Platt LIMITED INTERIM REPORT : half-year to 30th June, 1966 The unaudited estimated Group results for the half year ended 30th June, 1966, are shown below together with those of the full year 1965. The Group turnover is affected by the formal completion of contract work, and the experience has been that the second half of the financial year yields the greater part of the year's profit.

The nemorandum has been sub--- The nemorandum has been sub- mitted by the Bar Association for Commerce. Finance and Industry, to the committee which is under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Winn. The committee was suggested by the Law Commission last October, to consider the jurisdiction and procedure of the courts in actions for personal injuries. \" In approaching reform of the law, whereby the person who is injured obtains compensation -for his Injury, a principal initial question is whether a system of personal accident insur- ance, should, within a limited field, supersede and replace the remedy by litigation,\" the memorandum suggests. Tsu he remedy by litigation is remedy against a Wrongdoer for a civil wrong, for example. his negli. gence, which has caused the accideni and the plaintiff's injury.\" After stating that if there is no wrongdoer \"of financial substance\" to be sued, there is no substantial remedy, the memorandum adds: \"The outlook today, however, is increasingly towards the responsibility of the community to provide for those who suffer misfortune . . \"Those who suffer the misfortune of industrial accident at work and those who are injured on our roads and railways, should be able to ob. tain reasonable provision . .. without establishing the identity of a wrong- doer.\" \"The association suggests that a system of personal accident insur- ance, limited to the field of these activities should be established if costs permit.\" ,",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent MANCHESTER. Sept. 4. A standstill on insurance rates for private cars and commercial vehicles until January next has been intro. duced by the National Motor and Accident Insurance Union, Manches ter. In a circular to all agents, the company says that in view of the Government's wishes on prices and incomes, it is not considered to be an opportune. time to make any alterations in published motor pre. miums, No revision in rates will be made before January, 1967. by which time the first phase of the \"absolute freeze\" will have been completed. Some or te changes made by the tariff offices and certain independent insurance companies were in line with the views of National Motor and Accident Insurance Union, according to the statement. However, the com- pany was not in agreement with all the measures introduced, and rates would remain pegged for the rest of the year. Commenting on the decision Mr. David Blank, the chairman, said the Board recognised that its policy- holders would be subject to* the freeze, as would, the company's own staff. He urged both policyholders and motor repairers to play their part in assisting the company to hold down rates, for the time being. Revisions, he added, would be necessary for all classes of motor vehicles in due course in order to cover the rising costs of claims. The company, howevet, did not intend to adopt the complicated schedule of rates announced by the Tariff Insur. ance Offices. Details would be circu. lated to brokers and policyholders towards the end of the year. ___ ,_Â·"

Richter simply does it; Kempff pauses for a fraction of a second with a sense of .anticipated effort, so that one fears he will hit the wrong note.

The sonatas are -spaced out in three groups span- ning Beethpven's career, each group falling conveniently in one of the three creative periods. Two early ones (F major and 0 minor, Op. 5) date from 1796, soon after the B flat piano concerto. The A major sonata, Op. 69, was finished in 1808, the year of the fifth and sixth symphonies. In 1815, a few months before his brother died and the trouble over his ward and nephew Karl began, Beethoven wrote the two works, in C and D, of Op. 102. The five not only illustrate Beethoven's evolution as a com- poser but mark the final emancipa- tion of the cello as a solo instru- ment. The two early sonatas were written for the French virtuoso Jean-Louis Duport to play at the Prussian court. They are dedicated to the King, Frederick William II, himself an amateur cellist, to whom Mozart had dedicated string quartets with prominent cello parts. But though Beethoven was careful to do the same, he mistrusts the cello's ability to maintain a singing line to the extent of avoiding a true slow movement; all they have is an extended introduction to the Allegro first movement, followed by a rondo finale. In the A major sonata, a big, genial work written at the height of his powers, Beethoven matches the two instru- ments more closely. There is still no separate slow movement, only .An Adagio introduction to the finale, but it is marked cantabile and it does give the cello a chance to sing.

   "text_content" : "by PETER BRANSCOMBE The Scottish National Chamber Orchestra's concert in the Leith Town Hall on Saturday contained only two works: Schubert's Fifth Symphony and Berg's Chamber Concerto. The Schubert is quite the most attractive of the sym- phonies written before the two great masterpieces of his full maturity, and under Alexander Gibson the orchestra played it with sobriety 4nd firm elegance. Berg's Chamber Concerto must surely be one of the most uncom- promising works in this year's festival programme. Completed in 1925 as a rather late present for Arnold Schoenberg's fiftieth birth- day, it is a highly complex piece. The opening \"Thema scherzoso con variazioni\" is scored for piano and 13 wind instruments: in the very long Adagio it is the violin which takes over the solofole; and in the concluding \"Rondo ritmico con Introduzione,\" after a cadenza for the two solo instru. ments, all 15 players combine. The Chamber Concerto is not based on serial principles, though it is atonal and highly contra. puntal. lu his own analysis of it, Berg stresses the importance of the number three in its musical struc. ture, three motifs at the beginning, one each for Schoenberg, Webern and himself, three movements, etc. More important than any theo- retical considerations, however, is the impact which the work makes on the listener at an actual per- formance. It will continue to reveal secrets with each new hearing, but there is plenty for the novice to enjoy-moments like the long- delayed violin entry, ppp and muted, the mysterious, haunting wind-writing in the same move ment, or the brio and excitement of the coda to the whole work. It was played carefully and with evident respect. Apart from Maureen Jones's firm hands at the keyboard, it had the great benefit of Brenton Langbein's sterling per- formance of the very difficult solo violin part in the second and third movements. It is not surprisin: perhaps that towards the end of the work (which lasts nearly 40 minutes and is played without a break) there were signs of strain from some of the wind-players. Berg at times seemingly asks th= impossible of them-the technical demands are truly formidable. It is neither flattery nor condescen- sion to say that Mr. Gibson and his SNO players acquitted them- selves very well. This performance was one of the major events of Ihe 1966 festival. The second half of Fritz Wunderlich's Sunday afternoon recital in the Usher Hall was devoted to Schumann's Dichterliebe. This cycle is prob ably the best-known and loved of all groups of Heine settings, yet it must be admitted that Schumann did not consistently respond to the shades of half-meaning and largely ignored the irony of Heine's roems. -This problem arises to a certain extent with all songs, for the composer must impose some shade of meaning, and must first have made up his own mind what emotion the poet was seeking to convey. This is the reason why only a few songs-by Schubert and Wolf above all-consummate a marriage between words and music of equal beauty. It was to Herr Wunderlich's great credit that he seemed aware in Dichterllebe of this problem. It meant that \"Ich grolle nicht\" lacked the defiance and \" I Rhein\" the sombre profundity of Schumann's vision-but the cycle as a whole came over In a res- trained vein that was a valuable corrective to the Interpretation one might have expected from an artist primarily famous as an opera singer, Hubert Olesen. who had earlier In the programme not always synchronised his accom- paniment perfectly to his partner's singing, played the vital piano part with tact and understanding. Apart from some vocal unhappi- ness in \"Ich grolle nicht\" the whole cycle came over in fresh, clear tones-and with almost exemplary diction. Nothing in the whole recital was finer than \"Ich. hab im Traum geweinet,\" though it is perhaps churlish to single out details in what was a finely in- tegrated whole. In the first half of the' pro- gramme, Herr Wpnderlich sang some well-known and little-known Beethoven songs, including a delightful \"Wachtelschlag\" in which the accompaniment has the dotted quail figure familiar from the \"Pastoral\" Symphony of a few years later, and a delicate and pensive little song in praise of resignation. It was not until the Schubert \"NachtestUck \" that the singer advanced beyond caution to the edge of greatness. Here and in another haunting Mayrhofer setting, \"'Lied eines Schiffers,\" as well as in a number of sodgs later in the programme, he and Herr Giesen seemed to be making music for its own sake and their mutual I benefit with rapt concentration and Sfine ffect.",

' . A master plumber who baili from Canberra. Australia, Devln\" who is 28 years old, is perhaps the' least well physiclly equipped pof the world'smaster golfers. Sta- inig an inch over six feet tall, he is almost painfully thin, weighing less than 160 Ibs. Almost exactly a year, agoÃ½ on' Septeber 9; be. WasP operated on in a 16ouston, Teks, hospital for varicose veins in both legs that had plagued him even before he.turned professional in late 1961. Surgeons made 29. incisions, and it was some weeks before Devlin returned home to begin months of exercising, bathing his limbs in sea water to strengthen the scar tissue. But before the end of the year he had won two tournaments in Australia. He returned to the American circuit early this year, but after' finishing second, eighth and sixth in his first three tournaments in successive weeks he fell away badly, and flew home exhausted. Devlin spent the best pan of a month on a rowing machine, and once more returned to America in June. Immediately he won the Colonial Tournament at Fort Worth, Texas, and in the following fortnight finished fifth and fourth in subsequent events. Again he lost his form, but because overseas golfers must com- pete in a minimum of tournaments in America to retain their players' card, Devlin struggled on, usually winning money but as he said not enough. He is now determined to arrange his future schedule so that he can rest after every three tourna- ments. He arrived at Southport in an advanced state of exhaustion, but in this' respect he was not alone. Billy Casner. who was -to became Bruce Devlin his chief rival in Saturday's final round, told me that he had never before felt so stale, mentally and physically, and he was one of many to say this. It was this factor which influenced so many of the top class Americans to stay away, and make nonsense of this tournament's claim to be a world championship. The British public was not de- ceived, and stayed away in thousands. The official attendance figure for the first two days was 7,500, little more than half the first day's gate in the 1965 Open at Birkdale. With so many really poor American golfers in the field, playing in threesomes at a snail's pace, the event failed absolutely to generate excitement until the final afternoon. Devlin first realised after his second round of 70 that his form was returning, if only he could retain his concentration. In this round he missed a putt of little more than a foot, another of inches when he tried to flick it in back- handed, and took evenu at the laqg 15th by playinga shot that he said he would never have attempted had he not been so sick and tired of playing golf. But the smell of victory had now reached Devlin's nostrls. He had begun to like the golf course. fter using hit driver but five times in his firt 'round, he. left it h his Ike r And becauset his rather flat, open-to-shut swing allows him to keep the ball low even when pitching, he was able to cheat the wind that discomforted his rivals with a 3-wood from the te. Devlin's worst round was his third, a 74, when he suffeefd from what he describes as a \"sour\" putter. On Saturday morning, when I recorded a broadcast with him, we did the job in a first-aid tent, where all was peace and quiet. This immensely likeable Australian lay down on the camp bed and asked jokingly if he could stay there all day. Then he sat up and said quite seriously that having got away lightly with his bad round be felt he might win if his putter got warm. Thankfully, I took him seriously, and got the ante-post price of 14-1 about him at lunch- time. I believe, as does Kel Nagle, that Casper was beaten by his own enormous ability. Because he is so often in contention in American tournaments, the pressure on him is more intense than that endured by his rivals. Although his golf was always beautifully composed, it lacked a little of the necessary devil. Neil Coles, always at his best late in the season, emerged with much credit and the biggest prize ever won by a British golfer in a strokeplay tournament, which was some compensation for his un- accountable failure in the Open. But the rest of our men again failed to stay the course. And one was left wishing that the ailing David Thomas, his tremendous hitting unlikely to be affected by the wind, could have played.",

   "text_content" : "BY LODESTAR After Friday's outbutst of mar- ket ebullience readers will, I know. wish me to take a look at some individual South * African gold shares, something that I have not done for a while now. For this purpose I have been looking through that first-class luide to this section of the vast world of mining, the Mining Jour- nal's quarterly review of South African gold shares. There is no doubt about this 'publication's objectivity. The potential share buyer will not find it easy to make a selection that has its unqualified approval as a purchase in current conditions. And by this I mean at the cur- rent price for gold and bearing in mind that there is still an upward pressure on mining costs in the Republic. Friday's forward surge in golds was, I know, largely brought about by one of those sea- soa;al outbursts of gold price talk that tend to break out in front of the annual get-together of the world monetary authorities. Economic Hedge And the buying, which was of an all-round nature so far as its sources were concerned, found sel- lers reluctant for another reason. With doubts so extant about the future course of both the U.K. and U.S. economies many holders re- gard the gold section as a hedge against this risk quite apart from any thoughts about a gold price rise. Which brings us back to the question of what the new buyer at this particular stage should go for. And I intend talking about the mines themselves now, not those well-known gold-mining risk- spreaders the finance house issues among which Union Corporation and Rand Selection rank promi- nently. The quarterly review mentioned gives its stamp of approval to Buffelsfontein, regarded as a \" lead- ing gold investment\" and giving in addition a stake in the future of uranium about which there is currently such a deal of long-term investment hopefulness. Buffels are 70s, were 77s 6d quite recently, and pay a 3s 6d dividend that should' be maintainable d pite the con- siderable proportion of earnings that is being confidently ploughed back by the General Mining management into the future of this Kletksdorp area mine. Doornfontein Doornfontein is regarded as a mine that is \"exceeding expecta- tions\" although here again sub- stantial capital expenditure is likely to preclude any further growth in dividends which have now risen to 3s. The price is 32s 4%d, which is Ss 3d below what it was before the recent shake-out in this market. Durban Deep, a veteran that is battling against the pressure on costs, is regarded as purely a specu- lation on a substantial increase in the price of gold, but it is worth while mentioning for the real en- thusiast in this respect. The price is 20s 7%d. The shares are not exactly volatile. They have only moved between this level and 23s 1 Yd this year. With East Rand Proprietary we come to a similar veteran which is regarded as a potential major beneficiary from a higher gold price, but not as otherwise attrac- tive, especially as dividends have been dwindling quite fast, the half- time payment for 1966 being only Is against Is 6d a year ago and a 1965 total of 2s 9d. The price is 28s 9d, about mid-way between its swing so far this year. Libanon Libanon is regarded as, all in all, a \"fair investment with the chance of any gold price rise making a considerable impact on its for- tunes.\" This could, indeed, be a share that would suit a bull in this market both as a currency and economic recession hedge. Divi- dends have expanded to 2s 2.4d. The price is 29s 1d, which is 3s 3d below that which buyers were paying earlier this year. Loraine, with a life that may be no more than 10 years, during which only modest dividends are likely, comes into the picture only as an out-and-out gold price re gamble at a price that at Ss IId ad is well below the par value of 10s. Id P'esident Brand has the mark of n- success on it now that it has takde, sover the nearby Saaiplaas mine if donly because, gold price or no, it ns has some likely improvement in lis dividends in front of it.

   "text_content" : "h, | st IBy Our Inaurance Correspondent 21Ã½ Last year BIA member com- panies spent over Â£80m. on having policyholders' cars repaired after accidents, while the cost of such repairs to all insurers-companies and Lloyds' underwriters-might well have exceeded Â£120m. This year's figures are likely to be higher, among other reasons be- cause of the imposition of SET which becomes payable for the first time this week: repairers have said that they cannot absorb the cost of the new tax and that re- pair charges must go up. Against this background, the news that the Prices and Incomes Board is to examine motor repair charges is of interest to both in- surers and the motoring public. Though there is a broad pattern of repair costs throughout the country, repair firms are of widely different size, use a considerably differing range of equipment and employ staff of variable quality. Further, some repairers specialiso in par- ticular jobs, such as panel beating, while others concentrate on par- ticular makes of car. Moreover, those situate in town centres have overheads higher than the rest. The effect of all these variations on repair charges makes the Board's task an un- enviable one; in consequence our expectations of any firm findings should not be pitched too high. I- Indeed another line of inquiry, S8 at present being considered by the SBIA, may prove to be of greater :s consequence. It is possible that in it the next few months the BIA will is establish a repair research station e to determine from the practical . handling of nyotor repairs a T reasonable level of repair costs. E Swedish Idea e . The repair research station is a SSwedish idea, conceived and estab. lished by a Swedish insurance e company, Folksam, and now sup. s ported by most Swedish motor in- r surers. A few months ago, a BIA -* delegation (which included a mem- c. ber of the consultants, McKinsey if and Co.) visited Sweden to inves- Y, tigate the work done there and it the claims made by Folksam. The 19 delegation's report is now being Y considered by the BIA and the r, chairman has declared: \"If we r- can derive any British benefit from I, Swedish experience we shall cer. r- tainly do so.\" The research undertaken by the n Polksam engineers In such direc. ir tions as the ultllisation of spare II parts from damaged vehicles, the s improvement of painting techni. i. ques and the use of argon weld. ir Ing Is said to have effected savy is ings of about 20 per cent. on ordinary accident repair costs. , These savings have been effected indirectly, for the Folksam station% rdoes not undertake accident repairs to policyholders' cars, and policy- holders still have freedom of choice 1of repairer-provided the repairer's Scharges are in line with those Sassessed and recommended by the Sresearch station, and published in the Folksam manual. Only if the estimated repair charges are ex- cessive is the motorist asked to go to another repairer whose-charges are known to be satisfactory. In this country the wide ranging Semployment of motor engineers to, examine damaged cars and to agree repair charges has probably gone a long way towards keeping Srepairers' charges, and therefore profits, within bounds. But these Sengineers can only use as a yard. stick the average cost for average technique. How much more effec. tive they might be if backed by the knowledge of the proven cost of a wide range of accident repairs is a question which can be answered only if the BIA does decide to follow the Swedish example.",

On the aifraoe side, major new U.K; military aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley P-1127 Kestrel and HS-801 maritime reconnaissance Comet are in quantity production for the AP while on the civil side air- craft such as the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 executive jet, the HS-748 feeder-liner, the British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven short-haul jetliner and the Anglo-French Concord supersonic airliner are all doing well. Military Orders Supporting this activity are f military orders for such aircraft b as VC-1s, Andovers, Dominies c (HS-125s), export orders for - ightnings, work on U.K. parts a and equipment for US. military c types being bought for the RAP, ii and civil work on such aircraft a as the Herald, while for the im- i' mediate future activity is now c beginning to get under way on a the new Anglo-French Jaguar a jet atrike-trainer aircraft. On the engine side, the out- f look for the immediate future is even more promising, with both Rolls-Royce and Bristol Siddeley t fully engaged-even stretched on some projects beyond their preent capacities so that they are having\" extensively to sub- I contract elsewhere-on engines covering the entire aerospace sectrum, from the Bristol Siddeley Olympus for the Con- cord, through civil and military p.ert-plants of all kinds down to light piston engines for private i and sporting aircraft. . Export sales of both aircraft and engines remain high, amounting to a record Â£105.2m.: in the first half-year, against Â£62.7m. in the corresponding derid last year, putting the I industry well on its way to achieving the target of Â£200m. exports forecast for the whole of this year, against the previous best of Â£156m. recorded in 1959. But even in these high export I figures the seeds of uncertainty for the future can be detected, The Hawker SMidey P-1127 vertical take-off fighte Sew U qiuastily now ~ uiir Iin I e for the bulk of them are attri- tt butable to big export deliveries as of barely three types of aircraft ir -the One-Eleven, the HS-748 a and the HS-125-and since new y contracts have not been gained , in recent months at quite as high Et a rate as at an earlier stage, there i- is bound to be some diminution N of export totals in 1967, failing n a quickening in the inflow of Lr new business. It is really thii longer-term ' future that worries the ndustry is most-the period following h 1970. It is for this period that Sthe industry feels decisions r ought to be taken now, if V design teams and production labour are not to be un- \" employed when the current , heavy work-load runs down. 31 Apart from the 'Anglo-French U Jaguar jet strike-trliner project and the Anglo-French Concord o supersonic airliner (which itself te is still subject to final Govern- ment decisions on the go-ahead ft for the most important phase b, of all, quantity production), i; there are few current projects st which can be expected to last ig well into the 1970s unless major ,e decisions are taken now. to e New Versions is 9. Airliners such as the One- rt Eleven, HS-748 and HS-125 may t still be in production at that Stime, probably n revised ver- idos of one kind or another *hile it is possible that new vet- sions of the P-1127 and mari- time Comet may also come lon to help keep acvit wings On the engine a id5 too, there may well be a su- atantial volume of aCtivlt: on uch .eogines as the Spey and on V/STOL power.plants,- the. Olympus for the Concord, sa on the \"big\" engines .Uoh -a the Rolls-Royce Advanced Tech- no.ogy BEnine for aircriftuch. as the projected Anglo-French\" \"air-bus.\" Most Lucrative Some of the projects on which the industry fees that much of its activity will depend in the 1970s are being discussed now, but they are slow to get moing The air-bus itself, which could become one of the most lucrative aircraft ever built, in the light of the massive passenger traffic expansion ex- pected in the future throughout the world, is bogged down in official committees at Ministry levels in .Britain, France and West Oernsny, and at preent there are few signs of it strug gling out of the mire. The projected Anglo-French variable - geometry supersonic fighter aircraft, somewhat too onthusiastically described in last February's Defence White Paper asir ograme,\" has potyet gt e eprapea with ed n w betee the ritsh and the eUhon l tp. wat sitof Out-la treqCtaremeun for three new types:of military helicopter a6b do not seeni to have got vry far, in Ag.lo-French discus- sions to date While nobody in the industry bically disagrees with, the principle of co-opera. tion with the Frech or anybody else, there qnow a growing feel- ing of- ty at t way in which m 'nyof these projects are beingdelayid in the ,preimi ary tatii etaeS especinly snce looming on the hiorizn are U.S. projectq which. c6ulM well take their plaes. Souit U;.S manufac- turers notably Loheed, are known to be seriously thinking of big air-bus type ircaft,while the possibility of Britain.buying a U.S. variable-gpometry. veson of the McDonnell Phantom, engined with Rolls-Royce Speys, cannot be entirely ruledout if the Anglo-French \"VO\" air. craft does not come.to fruition. On the civil side, too, the in. dustry would like to see a go- ahead on such new airliner pro. jects as the HS-136, although bl of lnd, I it. feint* ast at bate hatt â¢: .paoe research that eaua B\".ritaib, 'lft it! li or a kind concebut it it sgud needed, is a I coherent long'r urspe, dis not left behind a forlong'terin stabilityin , * audus shne sides ofthein. Plans Unknown Apart from this need for clearer ideas on future projects, the industry also wants urgently a ceasr notion of Government plans for its structure .and ownership. Currently, plans for the take-over by Rolls-Royce of the entire share capital of Bristol Aeroplane Company, (which owns SO per cent. of Bristol Siddeley Engines), and for the acquisition of the other 50 per: cent. of BSE held by Hawker Siddeley Group, are well under way. SIs this meriger is finally. effe- tive, it wil create not only the biggest aero-enine combine this side of the Atlantic (and one of the two biggst in the world, the other being Pratt and Whitney of the US.), but will also give RRollRoce a collection of in- terests in the airframe industry -10 per cent. of Westland, 20 per cent of British Aircraft Cor. poration and 15i per cent. of Shbrt Brothers and Harland- that it has said it will not want to keep-although to whom it will sell them is not knownL At the samie time, it is known that the Government, while approving of the aero-engine merger in principle, also wants rLi to see some further rationulisa: 0 tioa of the aif'r rmeside of he sindutry, probably with some Governmnt stake -in the equity of the indinty It isthus pos- sible that it night 'acquir the stake in BAC from Rolls.Royce, it is possible that the Govern- ment'may also continue to press for agdirec mrger of BAC and Hawker Siddoley Aviation. The latter ;moe, in the. opinion of many in the industry, would be a disaster, for it would create a mammoth consortium operating across the entire spectrum of aaerospace affairs, something that is done nowhere else in the world, even in the U.S. Such a combine, it is believed, would be almost unmanageable. Whichever way the.Government decides to move, its future plans are stillanknown t the didus try, and this adds the current alr of long-term uzcetanty. But despite this,- and despite he bad nocks it;has taken in the pastÃ½o years industry is stillA1igorous. 'It still has desigi:iams capableof produc- ing hilgI competitive projects, and production teams capable of building them. It is accepted that much of its future must lieqn collabora- tion with the aerospace indus- tries of the Continent, end the British industry is anxious to collaborate, for it knows that Sonly in this way can the tech- Snological onslaught from the I U.S. in Europe be countered. SThe fruits of past collaboration t will be seen in the foreign air- craft, using British engines and Sequipment, that will participate i in this year's Farnborough show, F while present and future- col- i laboration will also be amply * demonstrated-Concord, Jaguar , and V-STOL-on the ground i and in the static exhibition. Despite its uncertainties, the SU.K. industry is far from Sfinished, and its shop window is far from empty. If that point , alone is digsted by all who go , to Farnborough this year, the t show will not ha been in vain.",

In this pro- gramme alone as many as 1,000 engines may be neded, if ur rt forecasts of sales of over 00oConords are achieved. In addtln, BiSB Is interested In the Sblnlae\" maret lor the future, troh I sitsÂ» trlp aite are rient with Pratt and Whiney of the U.I. and Snema on the JT9D, which sl the power unit o th bi Boing 747 \" Jumbo\" let airliner and which la alob contender for the airbut project Becaurs of Its past work on high-pressure compressors, BS Is to undertake developmenta In this field for Pratt and Whitney. It Is also possible that BSB will undertake manufacture in Britain of parts for all the JT9Da made for the 747s, If this comes about BSE, on top of the demand for the Olympus, will have a masnlve workload for the later 1960s and the 1970 on these two engines alone, Vast Size All these activities are already pressing the two British aero. engine companies very hard in. deed, and the current world shortage of aero-ongine manu. faoturing apacity (and with it a shortage of hihy-killed labour, for ero.engine building In virtally a prolion engineering craft, depite the vast lze or some of the engines involved), is reflected in Britain as much as it is in the U.S. In order to ease the pressin burdens in these directions, RollsnRoyce is already sub.-ontracting to such countries as Belglum, Prance, Germany, Italy owede Inn Japan, while ai home BSe si already doing 30 Kr cent, of the work on the oIoye ys for the RAP And NvCy@ Phantoms, Rolls. .oyc hs also preparing a new plant In Ulter to employ over ,000 on aeroengine con. ponents, while BSB recently moved into an additional 90,000 square feet of factory spaoI at 81rohgrnve, Cardiff. All the slmna are that thin current heavy workload will in. ereaie, rather than diminish One of the particularly inlflcant aspeots of the British aero.engine industry Is the way in which it already works closely with com. panies overseas. Espeoally this is true in the development of V/STOL and certain military engines. Where at present some of these powerplants are in their early stages-- uch as the RB-172 (with Turbomeca) for the Jaguar let sitrketrainer, and the RB. 153 RB.162 and RB0193 engines (jointly with MAN Turbo. motoren of West Germany) for various types of V/STOL air. craft-they will, In the not too distant future, enter the produc. tion phases as the alrcraft they power are ordered in quantity for their respective Air Forces. Since the demand will be con. siderable, further extensive presure will be exerted on the U.K. engine manufacturersn Thus, probably at no previous time have the engine companies had such a promising outlook, or a heavier work.load, as they have to-day. As a result of the Impending mergr of the two companies, the outlook for the future is not only promising It is also Intrigu. Ing, to say the least. At present the European air-bus project is being delayed by difflculties over a choice of ensine-either the RollIsRoyce \" Advanced Tech. nology\" power-plant or the Pratt and Whitney JT9D built in Burope by BSB and Snecma. Once the merger is effeoted, does RollsRoyce insist upon Its own engine being used, or does it still leave te competition open, knowing that whichever way it goes it will gain a sub- stantial share of the business? Equally, does it continue, or sever, the agreement between BSB and Pratt and Whitney on the JI9D? The general feeling is that it may well continue with it, for if BSB is to make parts for the JTrD, this will give Rolls-Royce another handsome stake in the \"bigengine\" market for the future in addition to anything it may be able to achieve with its own power-plant. But what will be the attitude of other European engine com- panies, such as Snecma of France, in which Pratt and Whitney has a small financial stake? Will they go along with the big British combine, or will they try to strengthen their own separate links with U.S. com- panies and create new ones in competition with Britain? It is In order to try to avoid this latter development that Rolls-Royce has this year made an unprece- dented offer of co-operation to the European engine companies. Giant Complex It has told those companies that it is prepared to give them the benefit of its entire accumu- lated experience in the field of civil gas-turbine engine manu. facture-Rolls-Royce is ready to be \"most generous,\" according to Sir Denning Pearson, deputy chairman and chief eecutive- If they are ready to co-operate with Britain in the development of gas-turbines for the future, including co-operation on the development of the \" Advanced Technology\" power-plant. If these approaches are sue. cessful, and Rolls-Royce is very serious about them, they could, together with a successful merger with BSE, croeto a giant Euro- pean co-operativoe nro-engine manufractluring complex, working across the entire spectrum of power-plants, rom rocketengines for space launchers through to light pIstonnglnes and to Idus. trial power-plants of various kinds. Such a combine could virtually dominate world mar- kets in the years ahead, leavina the Americans behind. This, in effeot, is the \" grand design\" of Rolls-Royce, sparked ol' by Its plans to acquire Bristol SIddeloy Ensines, The plan is almost hreath- takina l its Immensity, but In Rolls-Royce's view it is essential if the current U.S. technological onslaught on Euirope is to be met and mastered,",

We must col- laborate more closely with our partners in 3Erope with the aim of fostering a strong' European aerospace industry. I am particularly glad that for the first time the forthcoming Farnborough Show will exhibit aircraft from Europe. I welcome this innovation and hope that in future years the exhibition will become even more international in scope. The British aircraft industry's contri- bution to aircraft produced in other countries is enormous. British engines and components are flying in the Majority of the world's civil transports.

One of the major problems is the engine and in the next decade much more. research and development effort will be devoted to this side. m Meanwhle;l\" ttV' Imperative Bg that the Corporation's next in hovercraft, Whel- meeting cer- ro tain basic needs -spu as noise Ad suppreeslo, ould.:bi.6aied6n b ,so' ,n obtainable a :\"qualified n. ngIues.

A few years ago we would have predicted the need of 70 to 100 h.p. per ton for a large hovership; to-day it is as low as 40 h.p./ton and within a few years researches are expected to establish that the installed power of a hovership can be as low as 20 h.p./ton, associated with a speed of at least 50 knots. Defence Forces Using the SR.N6 as a model and then the SR.N4 in con- trolled experiments, the design parameters of a hovership will be established. A first ocean- going model of 400 to 500 tons could be produced and we can reasonably extrapolate the planned technology to project a ship of 4,000 tons which would have an open sea range of over 1,000 nautical miles, a speed of 50 knots and a freight/passenger capacity equal to 1,600 tons. This represents the first con- ceivable stage in the hovership. A craft with the ability to run on roads, operate over marshes and rough country and negotiate water is of particular interest to the farmer, the forester and the defence forces. This type of hovercraft can play an important transport role in underdeveloped countries, and active development is proceed- ing with Government support. Hovertrains, the handling of freight containers and large unit transporters are not being eeglected. There are amany problems, not wholly engineer- ing, which have to be, resolved before the former can be con- sidered as a viable system for this country. Nevertheless, re search is proceeding and a large transporter will soon be on test. To keep our hover-technology ahead of application a rational and objective research pro gramme is needed. In the 'hover-science\" field, the Govirnment's research estab- lishments will have to be involved in fundamental studies and the Corporation will work closely with the Government on this programme. The Corporation's shareholders have agreed to provide an initial capital of Â£5m., which will pro- vide adequate finance for a few years; thereafter, further sums will be needed if the industry is to expand as planned. In such circumstances, no difficulties about raising further capital are anticipated. The main financial problem for the next few years is likely to arise from the need to incur heavy research and development expenditure while turnover and profits are only building up gradually owing to the long-term nature of most of the important contracts to be carried out. However, with the help of NRDC, the Government and the Corporation's share- holders, this problem will be solved, as everybody concerned is determined not to lose the lead which this country presently enjoys in the hovercraft field. Licences have been granted in the U.S. and Japan because the U.S. \"foreign bottom\" legisla. tion makes it compulsory for civil hovercraft operating in and around the U.S. to be built there, and the export of hovercraft to Japan is made difficult and ex- pensive by the size of the craft and the distance involved. How- ever, the existence of British master-patents has made it pos- sible to negotiate licences which provide for royalties and an nterchange of technical informa- tion on suitable terms for the life of the patents. In this way, the Corporation will best be able to exploit the important British inventions in this field. Fuel Consumption The jump from the small craft to the large SR.N4 was made to meet a Channel ferry requirement and economic studies showed a profitable transport system would emerge. The engine developments in the 1970s indicate that fuel con- sumptions will fall such that the gas turbine engine will be the only logical means for power for hovercraft and hoverships. At 700 tons all-up weight with present knowledge of air pro- pellers and gear-boxes, a change in propulsion will be needed. The super cavitating water pro- peller may be used, but this also involves the same gearing prob- lem; a craft so propelled will also have a limited speed, which will detract from its economics. The British Hovercraft Cor- poration predicts that hover- craft and hoverships will rapidly develop in 1970-80 into large sizes and the only means of propulsion which will fit into the capability of the craft-60 knots in open sea with ranges of the order of 3,000 nautical miles- will be water jet propulsion. Land Problems In the next few years, BHC expects to see a gradual intro- duction in many parts of the world of the hover-ferry and the increasing military use of hovercraft in off-shore policing and defence roles. The SR.N4 and all its possible variants can influence the trends of naval and commercial ships and, as tech- nology is advanced and consoli- dated, the hovership will have a tremendous influence on sea and amphibious transport in the next 25 years. The special land problems will also be met by hovercraft designed to travel over many kinds of land and water-logged surfaces. In the field of mass transport, it is doubtful whether the hovertrain will replace air or rail inter-city links. Its use in new suburban communities may develop but many problems have yet to be resolved, not the least of which is the major cost of the track and the associated real estate. This country's effort can most profitably be directed towards the vehicles which by virtue of their performance and economics will find a growing. demand throughout the world and the British Hovercraft Corporation's efforts will primarily be directed towards this promising market.",

Air transport holds one of the n top places among the sectors s of the economy being most ( intensively developed in the h Soviet Union. The heightened c interest in this form of transport c is quite understandable, bearing li in mind that Russia's territory p is almost treble that of the U.S., a and that it is over 3,000 miles from north to. south and twice e as much from east to west. Air c transport reduces loss of time to a a minimum in comparison with I land transport, that is, by 93-95 e per cent. r A dense network of Aeroflot r routes covers the country. The I Moscow-Khabarovsk route, over 1 4,300 miles long, holds a special place among them. It passes I through important economic areas where the construction of ( I new plants and hydro-electric s stations has been launched. t Other air routes, such as a Moscow-Vladivostok or Mos- i cow-Yakutsk, cover a distance t of nearly 5,000 miles. The I length of the Moscow-Petro- f pavlovsk-Kam6hatka route is ,about 5,600 miles. sAir services connect all the e economic, administrative and r cultural centres of Russia. In ) addition, numerous services of i local importance have been 5 established within the Union republics, territories, regions and It national areas. There are already e regions, such as Archangel and r Dniepropetrovsk - and even Il whole republics, such as Turk- a menia, Yakutia and Tataria- c where planes fly to most of the f district centres. The last decade has been especially noteworthy for Soviet civil aviation, thanks to recon- struction of the civil air fleet. This was initiated in 1956, when the first domestic turbojet TU-104 planes emerged on Aeroflot routes. They initiated regular passenger traffic to Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Sverd- lovsk, Tashkent, Tbilisi and Prague.' Planes of this type, which gained worldwide recog- nition, subsequently began fly- ing to many other big cities within the country and also to West Europe, Asia and Africa. Long-Range Following the TU-104, the aviation industry supplied Aero- slot with the IL-18, AN-10 and TU-114 turboprops. They are designed for long-range trunk airlines, including such distant a routes as Moscow-Havana, a Moscow-Delhi and others, on d which the TU-114 makes fast ti non-stop flights. Aeroflot was 0 also enhanced with the TU-124 *+ turbojet and the AN-24 turbo- n prop, designed for carrying pas- s sengers, freight and mail along a local routes-between the re- c publican and regional centres, n Now all the Union republics p have their own turbine-engined n fleets and have fast direct air a links with Moscow. The wide-scale introduction of new aviation machinery played a decisive role in Aeroflot's development. In 1956 passegger traffic on jet panes ws a mere ,o.$,er. cenW artotatanport. wberea t6Â»di:y; it contututes more than 8Q per cent. Ina the same period, commercial busi- ness has increased by 150 per cent. The ue of new planes made it possible to cut flight pric*s by half. This attracted more air plsseqers and ensured a high rate of commercial efleo tiveness-70.9 per cent. in 1965. Considerable progress has * bene made in, the construction and recanstrction of airports capable of handinif turbojets and turboprops. In Moscow, in particular, Shermnetievo and Dohmdedovo airports were put into operation. Together with Vnukovo and ,Bykovo, they form the capital's air junction, one of the biggest in the world. In the period 1959-65, 45 new air terina were put into r- vice, includig Kiev, Odessa, Novosibirsk, - uibysev, Ufa, Ashkhabad, Sykt~vkar, aku and Kemerovo. Fifty hotels for passengers have been opened. The service provided for passengers both on the ground and in the air has noticeably improved and is im- proving all the time. Freight Routes All this has raised the inter- national prestige of Soviet civil aviation. In 1956 Russia had agreements on air communica- tion with 17 countries, and Aerolot made flights to 16 countries. To-day agreement exists with 50 countries, with fights to 38 countries. In addition, the AN-12 carries freight on th4.Mosodw.Paris and the Moscow Karachi -Colombo- Djakarta routes. Individual flgts have been made to North and South America, Australia and New Zealand. Agreements have been signed on opening the A bus driviar out of the new Soviet transport plane, the AN-22. modified variant the payload number of -pasengers to 220, and the range of flight to 5,278 miles.

The first was that the achievement of each project required facilities beyond the scope of mos individual European aprat', companies-and beyond ifdea the national budgets of Euro- pean countries, considered Indi. vidually. The second was that wii budgets and requinmentsd of each country so limited, each project achieved only srall-a le production, thus leaving i ate s immense burden of esearch inmmense burden of research dvelSpmo t ' nd t'olian costs go, ,b cad red that . S rao,. .time, ahd for ma rasons progress in that dio tion ',a bfiloked, and it. was only a.few years ag that all interested parties in Europe realised that to continue with dispersed efforts would lead to a rapid decline in Europe's share of world aerospace research, production and sales. Recently, therefore, there have been a number of agreements inking industrial and govern. uental organisations. Dificul- ties have admittedly appeared from time to time in the course of these efforts, but the general outcome should be rated as highly positive and an incentive I to further action. In this article I propose to examine some of these joint. ventures and the Iessons gined from them. Co-operation can only be established gradually and pre- supposes the development of contacts leading to mutual con- t, fidence. These contacts'.should occur, not only at management aYel but should be spread also ver.,a wide canvas of opposite :nuQibs.- technicians, produc. tion managers, administratori. 'paeral managers, heads of public departments and govern- Sments. In setting -up contacts, all Sforms of co-operatioi play a Spart.

SComplete Success Under the overall manage. Sment Of Breguet, this co.n sortlum include companies in Germany, Beium, France and the herlands. Equipment for Sthe aircraft Wil be supplied by Britain, Canada and the U.S. Sbesides these countries. Thus f the industries of seven countries, Sfive of them European, are collaborating successfully. R Production is now in full aswing and the first operational aircraft have been delivered. The oordination of several in. dutri- an seven countries was a osisderaIle organsational otaofra fnsa size which met W0th 1smplete sneaa-. The SiX0a9meMa moreovr kept sericty to dclvlry dates ad The \"Atlantic pro.rm\" 1m ebraced not only aiftme researe and bproductlon, but also engines and other' equip. ment. The Rolls-Royce Ty.e enginesowere built by a large consortium comprising Ro&' Royce of Britain, Hispano of Fracne, MAN of Germany anid FN of Belgium, which allocated various parts among themselves and operated three production lines.. Parallel Venture In 1959, the French and German air forces set up a joint projet for a two-enginedturbo jet aircraft weighing more than 40 tons, the \"Transall,\" for military transport and paratroop purposes. The design and pro- duction of this programme were entrusted to one French com- pany, Nord Aviation, and three German.companies. The proto- types and` pre-series aircraft were delivered on time in France and Germany. A parallel co-operative venture was the production in Europe under licence of the Lockheed F.104 .Starlighter. Germany, Italy, Belgium and Holland collaborated in this enterprise. The remarkable success of these pioneer co-operative projects speaks highly for the policy of international collaboration, and understandably has led to other projects. The Concorde project for the first commercial supersonic air- liner was formally ratified by the British and French Governments in 1962. Work was evenly divided, with Sud Aviation and BAC responsible for the air- frame and SNECMA and Bristol Siddeley for the engines. More than 200 companies in France and Britain are com- mitted to this huge project. 4 Companies in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Britain joined in T\"e IRngut.IAC 0 Jagodr\" a Fim.Bidtfih advaced -njQw ad btid dke afrcrafL building the medium-haul twin- jet Fokker F.28. la the armaments field, similar agreements were reached for the production under licence of the Hawk missile. British, French and German companies are collaborating on other projects. The Defence Ministers of France and Britain signed agree- ments in 1965 for the production of various military aircraft, in- cluding helicopters. These agree- ments mark an important stage in collaboration by forging last- ing links between British and French industrialists, as they cover a span of more than ten years. Decisive Stage The first of these projects is well under way. It is the twin-jet Jaguar trainer and tactical sup- port aircraft, with airframe by Breguet and BAC, and engines by Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca. The Jaguar programme com- prises various land and sea ver- sions. It is being undertaken with enthusiasm by large sectors of industry in France and Britain. It is not unlikely that other European countries may be gradually invited to cooperate. Its success could mark a decisive stage in inter-European co- operation. In commercial aviation, Euro- pean collaboration has been in- more uItlea so tar. it souldI not be overlooked, however, that -r almost all Caravelles are fitted he with Rolls-Royce engines and he that the Fokker Friendship air- ch frames are built by Breguet, re while the engines are Rolls. . Royce Darts, and that the o Fokker 28 Fellowship pro. e. gramme mentioned above was on recently originated by Fokker. n- The medium-haul 250-300 ee. seater airbus has already been ge the subject of research and of vt- very important talks between nd British, French and German iey companies.' The problems are en such that no definite agreements have yet been reached. It would be very regrettable if no solution were ultimately found, for if existing efforts failed it would be is a tragic error which could have et incalculable consequences for the p- European aerospace industry for by years to come. es Finally it may be said that .a European aircraft constructors m- are now well aware that their e- future depends on co-ordinating en larger resources than either they rs or their countries possess indivi- nd dually, and on enlarging their at markets. The considerable be achievements in this direction in te. the last decade are encouraging ye enough to be worth pursuing and o- developing. Otherwise it seems clear, in my view, that the Euro- o- pean aerospace industry risks en rapid decline.",

   "text_content" : "By Sir GEORGE EDWARDS CHAIRMAN, BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORPORATION (OPERATING) LIMITED I am on record over the years as saying that the strength of the British aircraft industry was being sapped by instability. Of its technical ability there can be no doubt. The industry has done more pioneer and break-through thinking in the aviation and asso, dated fields than those of the rest of the world put together, Yet our industry has, for most of the post-war period, lived in such a highly charged atmo. sphere of political controversy and comment that many people now think we are in. competent, stupid, wasteful and feather bedded. Even the hard fact of .the great export achievements of the industry (a record Â£200m. in this year) is submersed beneath this props. anda \"image\" of ineptitude. No industry that earns Â£200m. a year overseas is inept. BAC companies alone have exported nearly Â£500m. In the last decade of which its current products- excluding Concorde - account for over half, Any aircraft industry must largely depend for technical and financial well-being on the basic orders placed with It by the Government, In Britain, specifl. cations for the defence equip. ment are drawn up by the Government or, in the case of key civil transports, usually by one of the two nationalisod corporations. Firm Belief Industry Is left with some room for manoeuvre, but not very much, So, unless those spociflcations are right, and within our national resources then a running commentary of criticism and comment Is un. leashed. An atmosphere is thus created in which cancellatlons are not only possible but pro. dictablo hence the Instability. The, Flowden Report high. lighted this. We, too, have no wish to mortgage our brains and facillltles to limited products which are unlikely to export and are therefore Ikely to die, Too often, however the choice has been to do Just that -or nothing, Incidentally, the prsnuae on Lord Plowden to produe his report has not been malod ',by me overnmont's apead In Implementin t It.

If many more go, that, of itself, will settle the matter for good, We now have another chance which, if taken, can put us into a strong position I again. The present Government < has the opportunity-and it Is I the last such opportunity-of estabiishing a stable programme. Britain can still reap the rich i commercial rewards from .the a technological genius which re* sides in her aerospace design and engineering teams providing the following pro-requisites are ! met; I, that foreign doubts as 1 to the solid future of the British aerospace industry are removed;, 2. that the defence equipment programmo already announced Is adhered to; 3. that financial support is given to the further development of British civil aircraft, One of our basic problems lies in the short run of our produc. tion programmes, We always work at the \" thick end \" of the learning curve, Development of existing types with a good sales ptentlil should be our policy, Tle present proposals that BBA should re-equip with develop. mentg of the Trident. VC.10 or OneBleven are oonslstent with till policy. Export Order If the present plan is adhered o, BAC has full work in all its, divsiioni until well into the A 1970s, To partloularle, since I the olosure of Luton, BA has c .tur divisions: Preston, Iton, Woybrldge and the Ouded I Werpons Division, I SPrslion has a 4,m1, export d Order for Lightnings, llus ah a lmPortint programme 'or the c BAC 145/167 and iublontract ork for the British purchase of v tIe UN, Phantoms.

Export prospects are good. Preston is also handling the British half of the work on the important Anglo - French Variable Geometry aircraft which the Government has described as the core and key. stone of its aircraft programme for the 1970s. The specification has been agreed-it meets the joint requirements of the British and French air forces and navies -and is a potential world. beater. I The Weybridge division, after the cancellation of the TSR.2 is dependent upon the civil aircraft programmes of the One. Eleven, VC-10 and Concorde. A 230-seater medium-short haul version of the VC-10 has the basic characteristics of the short. medium haul air bus, plus the established record of the standard VC-10 as a high load factor vehicle. The sales of the One-Eeleven in the tough export market are already near the 100 mark (plus 30 or more out on option) and are steadily increasing. Already it has earned Â£100m, In exports (which is nearly as much as did the Viscount) and Is, on its own, at the head of the British dollar earning table. Main Weapons The One.Eleven, together with the Super VC-10 and the pro. duction Concordes, will keep Weybrldgo and its Hum factory in work for 10 years-much of it on high conversion value export sales, An industry which takes small amounts of raw material and, by brains and skill, converts them to exports worth from ~20 to Â£40 per pound weight Is what the British economy needs molt, The Guided Weapons division has a good, sound and balanged programme, and its present pro. ducts have brought In some Â£60m. In overseas sales. Its main weapons are the Blood. hound and Thunderbird AA systems, Vigilant and Swingire anti.ltnk missiles, and they have another highly exportable pro. duct In the ET-316 battlefield AA weapon, There Is also the UK-3 space programme, the Skylark rocker and a Isre diversity of electronic, industr al and precision and plastio \" s1pi off\" products, Fliton has some OneiBlegn work, but it mainly depends ei Concorde, The salt that evry 4sngle Important U.., airline l eiter bought, or Is neuotlatln to buy Concordes Is tho b proof that I can give that this is now an aircraft which, in heir view, will make money for Ithem.",

In this sense, it is both proper ant possible to \" compete with Atherica 4nAl supplying .and operating communication sys- *-i tsem.- .Eyen. hre, the .separate systems would'til be:within a frapiework of a global agree. ment on lystem standards and frequency allocations. Success in either collaboration or com- petition will only be achieved by close co-ordinatiop between the space organisations of Europe. Sound Investment Moreover, a co-ordinating authority must be capable of looking ahead to ensure that funds are properly invested in Sthe areas which will yield the greatest technological or sinan. I cial returns. Continued support Sos ESRO is vital, and so too n for collaborative scientific pro- a grammes with NASA which are ' sensible and valuable. ' What are the posibilities of setting up such an Authority? If First, t must be ree onlsed that 0 a direct equivalent ofthe United States National Aercsutics and r Space Administrati h'is not *, appropriate, since NASA can operate by inviting straightfor- o ward competitive tendering from 8 American companies without too *\" much regard as to where the Y contracts are boeing distributed SSeoa raphically. S'this may never be the case in It Europe in the present political t* elimate, as the. nations contril t* buting the funds expect to it receive proxmately the value n of their Contributions in con. tracts for carrying out work %. For example, In ESRO, at a ki given time this \"balance of pay- it ments\" fluctuates. but over a ~soding the ESRO I ratellte, which due to be launched next year, at the Hawker Siddeley Dyqnames factory. period some balance is desired by each- country. In ELDO the balance require- ments are even more mandatory. The normnal engineering prob- lems of interfaces between equip- ment are therefore magnified by the:existence of politicians, fron- tiers and- languages, and a co-ordinating authority must try to-work out a formula to ensure that a fair situation exists. However, if the authority is concerned with a total allocation of funds covering veiles.spec- craft and ground eqiment, it should be easier to; effect a- proper balanc withiri'the diver- sity of work in hat. Maximum Freedom While, clearly, each nation will wish to monitor to some de- gree how its funds are being spent, is it too much to hope that a maturity will develop in European affairs to allow such a centralised body the maximum freedom to invest money wisely in order to obtain maximum returns? Europe will have to face the fact that investments in space must be selective, but there will be inevitably-and properly- some duplication of technology to that in America and Russia, in -order to ensure an indepep- dence of operation where col- laboration is not appropriate. It is worth recalling, in any case, that the Gross National Product of the European coun- tries at some Â£155,000m. is over two-thirds that of the U.S. at Â£225,000m. and we are not, by any means, such poor relations unless we choose to pretend to be. The matter to which a space authority must address itself with the greatest urgency is already with us, namely, that of communications satellite systems. Perhaps the most Im- portant ingredient of success is to obtain the right attitude of mind, both in the public and in the Government, to want to carry out a space programme properly, and not to treat the matter as an expensive luxury. Supported by well-balanced national space programmes (still sorely lacking In this country) the central European authority could ensure the best benefits from the investments in national and International work. In this way, and only this way, can the countries of Europe, each with modest resources, succeed-but succeed we must or commit technological suliide in the long term.

NASA's problem, in short, is that Apollo is proving to be a C diffcult programme to follow. 0 So far, the space agency has r not been able to come up with c any clear new post-Apollo t objectives which are amenable a to the scientists and Congress- men, the President and the people: objectives which are excitihg and challenging enough so that they can be called upon annually to keep NASA's budget high and its skilled engineering teams intact. Completion Date Landing on the Moon is an exciting thought; ah inevitability 1 which has been on man's mind for centuries and which embodies the highest order of challenge and technological development. Further,-the challenge was put forth by a dynamic young American President. What to do next is not nearly so clear. Making NASA's prob- lem worse is the war in Vietnam, a very costly battle which Administration officials have' now wisely stopped tagging with a completion date. War spend- ing is now approaching an annual rate of- S15,000m., and costs are rising faster than. ex- pected. In the fiscal year just 'ended, Congress was asked to add on more than $12,000m. for Athe war above the. original Defence Budget. 'Even though .fiScal year 1967 is only a few months old, there are strong in- dications that the budget, which included a hefty request for Vietnam, will have to be aug. mented again by another $7,000. S10.000m. In the face of this, it is not likely that NASA' can expect support from the President and the Congress for a budget which exceeds its current SS.000m. level. There is, in fact, the likeli. hood that fiscal year 1968 will bring the strongest challenge ever made to the normally sacro- sanct NASA budget if the war continues.

Some even say that if the extraordinary. success that the manned spaceflight programme has experienced to date is carried over into the early phases tf, the Saturn/Apollo testing, 'a manned flight to the Moon could even .come late next year. The first flight of the huge Saturn V booster, which will make the lunar journey, will come in February or March, 1967. It will be unmanned. Another unmanned test shot will follow. In the meantime, the Apollo capsule will be gathering flight time with a crew aboard in Earth orbit during test rides aboard the middle- sized, or more powerful Saturn I booster. The first manned Saturn V/ Apollo flight is scheduled for late next year, to be followed by two more at three-month intervals. From one of these three flights, if all goes well, will come the choice to make the historic trip. Despite the threat of austerity because. of the war, optimism and confidence within NASA are extremely high. The reasons are on the record: 14 successful manned spaceflights and a log .book of achievements and safety beyond even the most Sildly optimistic projections tmade five years ago--Mariner Sphotos of Mars, Ranger photos en of the Moon, a perfect soft- Lry .landing and photo mission by a ed Surveyor spacecraft with' the las tenacity to. live through the led lunar night, 40g a string of of,Mercury and Gemini flights 'a which have brought rendezvous, on docking,. and, pxtrarvehicular ar. .activity firmly\" witliin', noddral age space procedure. vill Where are the Russians? vill That is the biggest question. ch, The last Soviet space flight with ed. a crew aboard took place on hot March 18, 1965.

The total U.S. space budget, therefore, is much closer to S7,000m. than the SS,000m. nor- mally represented by NASA. What is more, the U.S. Air Force now has its biggest foot in the door-a firm commitment by the Defence Department to go ahead with its Manned Orbit- ing Laboratory programme. SSatellite System \" MOL, a 41-ft-long space station canister attached to a modified Gemini capsule (in which the two-man crew will return to Earth after 30 days or more in orbit), is intended firmly to evaluate the role of military man in space-reconnaissancei, surveillance, submarine tracking, missile early warning, weather watch, and communications. MOL, now moving into full- scale development, is expected to generate $400-$500m. in new funds for the next two-three years, with flights beginning in late 1969 or 1970. Each flight will cost between $50-$60m. The prognosis for MOL, even before it gets off the ground, is that it will prove to be a highly,, useful system. Unmanned U.S. military reconnaissance and early warning satellites have been brought to an amazingly high state of development, though little is said publicly. The first operational military communications satellite system now has eight of its 20-24 satellites in orbit and on-the-air. An advanced system of strategic combat links is scheduled for J970, in addition to a system designed for tactical or limited warfare use. Unmanned sur- veillance satellites are being, expanded in capabilities and lifted in altitude to get a better look at a wider area. More Money Furthermore, both NASA t. and the Air Force are working a hard at developing the techno- ,e logy to commute from space ,e stations in orbit with ferry-type ,f re-useable spacecraft, aero. ts dynamically designed with lift- s ing capabilities so that they can' ir return to any specific landing l -field. If MOL'proves successful, the ferry vehicle is a certainty. i7 Development is seen as begin. f. ning late this decade and the :h cost should be large. ,n The growth of military space ie spending and requirements Jt could also bring about a call st from Congress for another look 11 at joint undertakings between NASA and the military.

   "text_content" : "By WIL ::M VHENZEY VICE PRESIDENT ANIb EDITORIAL blRRICAN AVIATION 'PUBLICATIONS . be giants of the U.S. aircraft inddstry are turning to giant air- craft to satisfy a fast-growing airline demand for capacity. Simultaneously, two of those firms are competing to produce the worl4d swiftest commercial transport, the so-called SST. Sbere is a continued upward swang in sales of existing jet transports, healthy military appetite for planes spurred by the Vietnam conflict, and the greatest boom in two decades in Senral aviation production and Althoigh Lockheed Aircraft Coqpsny and The Boeing Com- pany are talking and acting in the ovemrszed jettransport class, Dus Aircraft. is capitalising on he \"stretch \" capabilities or its DOC8, and the first forward jump in heavy capacity trans- ports is the series '60 DC-8s saon to be in scheduled service. In the U.S. alone, airlines had ordered 59 \"stretched 8s\" by June 3M0 SThere is an immediate if not unanimous airline acceptance of the Douglas plane, because air- lines are flying at or near capacity with existing jets, air- port saturation at key cities pre- cludes additional schedules, and more seats and cargo space with the same number of schedules addup to sound economics. Lucrative Contract But all this is not to say Lock- heed and Boeing are running behind. On the contrary, Lock heed, having won the lucrative Air Force contract for the mili tary C-5A, is promoting a com- mercial version of that plane called the L-500. Lockheled's rather conserva tive approach to pushing the L-500 is recognition of doubts in many quarters that the pub- lic and operators are not yet ready for the transition from 200-250-seat planes to those with capacities running up to 700 800 or 900 seats without more gradual interim steps. The feeling among numerous top airline officials in the U.S. is that super-capacity jets are good for ransoceanic flightsbut have no ijnmediate future in the , hs,,ts .,.U 4dormitc passeicer market The re1aoni2 g . ee is that, while additkial coproity is needed, less freqtuncy of schedules is nor. Ini ort, these operators believe ltey; will attract more traffic with: sO schedules, for examptle,. than with five using a plane twice as big. Lockheed, therefore, apears to be feeling the- market for a compromise, in other wordr, an L-500 with, m ogt'f 'its load. carrying capaity' devoted to cargo. There a're4irline officials who see merit in this. Potential Saccess But none of this appears to detract from. the potential sucoess of Boeing' -decisioh to build the mammoth 747. .Stimu-: lated by Pan Amerian World Airways' order for 25 jumb jets last . April, the. programme appeared to get the final go-. ahead recently when Britaim approved BlAC's recommenda- tion for six 747s. Despite several orders for the plane following PAA's, Boeing had to decide by August 1 either to launch or cancel the pro- gramme. With 'problems in- volved on both sides, a BOAC order would insure a lucrative route for operation of the 747 from New York to London. The order did just that and gave the encouragement for which Boeing was looking. . The Lockheed-Boeing fight in the jumbo jet field ,also has an interesting aspect apart from competitive sales. 'It places Lockheed, with a substantial Government contract' for. the C-5A, :against Boeing, with private! financing for its' 747 project. To, date, military fuids have fathered development of most commercial 'transports. Lock- heed, thus has the benefit of the accepted formula. Boeing, on the other hand, will invest heavily for several years.without return. The effect these projects will have on so-called \"airbus\" development cannot be accur- ately gauged at this point. But there is strong sentiment among s6me ' major airlines, not yet co6ttted on thi 747, for a twin- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t engined airbus in the 204-300 pas r class. Os.e U.S. carrier Sis nbtwn to le ready to commit fuqds for up to 50 of these planes if some manufacturer will undertake production. Any . multilateral European project in this. area would get an attentive eye from U.S. operators but the balance-of- payments issue in America could be a mitigating circumstance. It woold not be unrealistic to consider the possible inclusion of a U.S. airframe and/or engine manufacturer in a European effort. Supersonic Transport But wbilp 'the irend to size monopo.liss .th general scene, SST , supesodic transport) deserves most ttention, for it is in this Government-dominated project that: the ultimate stakes are the highlest. This month the finalists in the competition submitted their designs for evaluation by a 300- man team of Government aero- nautical experts. In the air- frame category it is Boeing v Lockheed: in the engine field. General Electric v Pratt and Whitney Division of United Aircraft. In January, 1967, the Federal Aviation Agency, sponsor of the - project, will announce selection. of-one airframe and one engine desigh winner and development of a prototype will get thider way. ' To date, the U.S. Government has advanced some $250m. on the lproject with manufacturers putting up an estimated S27m. An additional S280m. will be committed before this fiscal year is out-$80m. through the re- mainder of this year and $200m. in the first half of n6xt. 'To this total of some $530m. committed by the Government so'far, the U.S. will add another $400m. in the fiscal year 1968 (begirining July 1, 1967). SThere is vocal opposition to this project in Congress but iinfluential members such as Senator Warren G. Magnuson and Senator A. S. Mike Monroney have the power to keep it on track. Of course, Magnuson, Monroney and others have the backing of' the White House which has given SST a top priority label. At this point, the big question centres around Who will win- Boeing or Lockheed? G.E. or P and W? The answer should come in about four months. An idea of how' rich a prize is atestakemwas given recently by , the president of Lockheed, Mr. a. Duu, wUU UIU LIUg&. UN firm, if selected. would employ 40,000 to 50,00 worers throughout the U.S. for 15 years. He predicted a saies volume of $1S520,OOm. from 500 to 800 aircat. \"There is just no question,\" Haughton. added, \"about a bright future for'the aerospace Industry.\" Reports put out by the Aero.- space Industries Associations. president Karl G. Harr, more than back up Haughton's opti- mistic appraisal. In 1965, Har:. said, sales in the aerospace: industry increased to a new record of $20,900m. Growing Need The total was barely over the S20,800m. of 1964 but, Hart pointed out, the 1965 results reflect increases in every product area except missiles. Thus, the value of aircraft sales alone a. jumped some S800m. to $9,700m. e for the year. By comparison, t missiles totalled $3,600m., space Svehicles accounted for $5,300m. and non-aerospace sales were t responsible for 32,200m. Harr explained the increase in aircraft sales this way: \"It is the Sresult of the demand for military Saircraft for Vietnam operations, rthe growing need for commercial aircraft resulting from the pre- sent re-equipment cycle of the airlines, and the rapid gain in utility aircraft sales.\" t The Government, of course, is the biggest customer of the aero- 8 space firms, but its share of total aerospace sales in 1965 dropped to 76 per cent. from 81 per cent t the previous year. S Conversely, aerospace expen- ditures constitute an impressive Spercentage of total Federal out- Slays. Thus, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1966, S16;900m., or 15.9 per cent. of total Federal Sexpenditures of S106,400m., went ' on aerospace products. This same S16,900m. accounted for ' 29.9 per cent; of total national -defence and space budgets and r for 65.4 per cent. of total pro. c urement, research-and develop.

Backlog figures meanwhile, re.equaly impressive. At the end of 1965, for example, U.S. firms had an aircraft backlog totalling $11,400m., almost equally divided between the Govenrment and private pur-' chasers. Aircraft Sales Last year alao, the industry produced a total of 15,049 air- craft, 12,549 of which were civil types, for the highest production igure in one year since 1947. An idea of how last year's per- formatnce is being bettered in 1966 can be seen in predictions by aviation leaders such as Cssna's Diane Wallace and Lear Jet's Bill Lear,,Sr., that the number of general aviation planes alone pTrouced this year will exceed 16,000. Last year, eight leading light aircraft and business aircraft manufacturers reporting to AIA's.Utility Airplane Council, s'howed aircraft sales of 11,852 units amount to about S319m. Cessna, with its Model 150 set ting the pace, reported net sales of $97.2m. to lead this booming industry. Beech Aircraft, with Iood sales on its Bonanza and Musketeer models was second with $72.2m. Next was Piper Aircraft, paced by Cherokee sales, with total. billings of $62m. All these are running well ahead of 1965. so far.

These figures would be sub- stantially increased if military niovements, and the unreported civil movements in uncontrolled air space, were included. The solutions are not obvious and cannot be achieved without considerable technical effort and financial expenditure. In Britain the problems are being tackled by the National Air Traffic Control Services organisation. Upper air space problems in- volve collaboration with fellow members of the Eurocontrol organisation and there is joint responsibility under ICAO for control on North Atlantic routes. The framework of the domiestic en route system, for the next 10 to 20 yoers has been set by the \"Mediator\" project, under which ATC will derive its dynamic infor- mation .fromn some ten radars im and iecoadaty, some \"ivil some military-.wic. will suremost ofw national airspace over 5,000 ~feet :The radar data will be remtted-by- broad band radio link to the new London AirTraffic Contrbl Centre at West Drayton wheie it will be extracted and stred for use in a complex of computers..

At the second s the flight control c ntre system for 20 Syears or more; will fade tfom the scene and be replaced by more sophisticated television displays and more efftective labelled plans. , One of the most exciting breakthroughs which is only now being assessed is the \" John. son \" touch-wire display whereby the controller touches the display at the point at which he wishes to amend it, and causes the programme to offer information from which the controller can amend the display, by again pointing in sequence to the data which' he requires.. Limited experiments carried out at the NATCS Air Traffic Control Experimental Unit have shown that this'method is much more effective and easy to learn than the use of the typewriter keyboard technique, and will undoubtedly have a considerable effect on. the man/machine relationship of the future. Complex Problem Much of the benefit to en route services from the \" Mediator \" project will be lost, however, if problems Which exist outside the air traffic control centre are not dealt, with con- currently. It is unlikely that there will be startling break- throughs here but steady im- provements are expected to be made. One of the most com- plex problems in this area is that of improving capacity in terminal areas. These are situated at the con. fluence of a number of routes and, perforce, are the most con- gested parts of the airspace with aircraft changing height and direction in the arrival and departure sequences. Thues have the greatest potential for delay \"nd deviation to operators. If all traflfic .jt area an-be,. handled at :o rp wabrt6 , eihnp radiating patterns can be de- vised; but in Britain this situa-, tion seldom exists and, hence, conflict of traffic from adjacent I aifields and the necessity for I split operations by airlines i arise. It is also nesay to determine the maximum uize at, a viable airports concerniing weather conditions. ATC cap- 1 city is, of course, only one of the 1 factors which go to settle the I optimum size of an airport, but 1 from the ATCaspect it is neces sary to assess what is the capa ; city of a singk e runway andhow .. many runways can be used simultaneously, In Britain it is prudent to base capacities against bad weather (Instrumnant. Flight Rale opera. I ting conditions). The present' view iN that on an ideal site, un- encumbered by noise routeing restrictions and allowing for every reasonable improvement in procedures and equipment, both 1 in the air and on the ground, it i should be possible to sustain a landing rate, on one runway, of 32 per hour. This is about 20 ! per cent. higher than the present 1 bad weather rate at Heathrow. i It is readily conceivable that on an ideal site, four parallel runways could be used simul- taneously-two for landings and two for take-offs-giving a bad weather potential of some 130 movements per hour. Whether it will ever be. possible to have more than two parallel landing and departure streams in bad weather is open to question, and assessment of airport capacity would have to be recast in the event of a preponderance of STOL and VTOL operations. Assuming that runway capa- city at an airport permits higher landing and take-off rates, what can be done to improve the expeditious and safe handling of aircraft in the streams arriving and departing from the airport? At present too much use is made of radar control, and ways must be found of en- abling the pilot to do much more for himself, with ATC monitoring rather than direct- ing. Radar sequencing will con- tinue for some years, but there is a place in future terminal area systems for a precise automatic The new Lona on Air Trafi Control Centre at Wes Drayton, which will become partly operational in November. \"t navigation system with pictorial presentation available to the pilot. It is too eartlto assess fully what effect juthi Jjets will have on the control system other than that of reducing temporarily the number of movements. If their handling characteristics meet the manufacturers' forecasts, it does not appear that they will pose any severe problems for .ATC. Higher Speed In contrast to jumbo-jets, supersonic transport aircraft will create many new problems. Their higher speed will reduce the time available for the controller to make up his mind. Sonic booms may impose routeing restrictions, and turns at sonic speeds over land may well have to be avoided to prevent concentration of shock damage. The operating charac- teristics of SST aircraft will create an entirely new situation in the en route phase of flight, particularly over the North Atlantic, where because the winds at supersonic cruising levels are relatively light, traffic will tend to concentrate near the Great Circle routes between Europe and North America. To conserve fuel, restrictive use of vertical separation will have to be avoided and so a much greater use will have to be made of lateral separation. It is true that very sophisticated navigational equipment installa- tions are proposed for super- sonic aircraft, but only time will show whether an entirely separate system of ATC sur- veillance over the Atlantic route will be needed to ensure safety with the separation standards deemed necessary for economic operation of the aircraft. A possible interim solution now being studied to assist control of traffic on the busy North Atlantic routes is the use of moored floating platforms- or sea stations. This imaginative project would make it possible to have VHF communications and radar surveillance in areas not previously served in this way. Five stations, two south of Iceland, two south of Greenland and one south of Newfoundland, would ensure surveillance of and communica- tion with an aircraft at least three times while it is crossing the ocean. This would improve efficiency and air traffic control and the economics of North Atlantic crossings. Whether this project proceeds or not will depend very largely on how much value the presence of the sea stations would have for the operators. NATCS, while maintaining and developing current opera- tional services, is continuously planning ahead. It has the problems and possible develop- ments referred to here and marny others under review. It aims to provide air traffic control systems of high standard to meet the needs of the day--with safety. C Crown Copyright."

   "text_content" : "By W. D. KOSTER CARGO MANAGER, EUROPE, BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION With increasing frequency I am asked if air freight is on the verge of its long-promised breakthrough. I am at a loss for an answer for I have not the faintest idea whether a breakthrough, in the purest sense of the word, is really pos- sible in this industry. What I am certain of is that air freight's accelerating evolu- tion has brought it to the point where it is a major factor in the transportation of goods. It even promises, however re- motely, to one day rival the carriage of passengers as an airline's major source of revenue. After an almost stagnant post- war start, air freight has had an explosive growth in the past few years, yet even to-day little more than two pounds from each ton of goods moved around the world travels by air. But it is a significant two pounds -in terms of revenue, the cream of the freight. Best Service The volume is increasing by as much as 30 per cent. each year-which could, I suppose, be construed as a breakthrough -but what is even more encouraging to the airlines is the size of the market which is still untapped by them. Millions of people can afford to fly, but it is quite another matter to persuade them to do so. But millions of tons of cargo.has to be moved each year and is potential air freight because it could-or should-be carried by air. The airlines' task is now to persuade the shipper that they have the best marketing service in the world. It is not the easiest of tasks, as we have found, for surface transportation systems are so well established. 'Perhaps the airlines are a little too cautious in their approach but in economic terms they are right to be cautious. New Approach The obsolescence factor in aircraft is so great, the rate of new developments so fast, that no airline can afford to buy fleets of freighters merely against a possible demand. They have to control their growth-they cannot store their product like manufacturing in- dustries-so that it barely matches the demand for capacity. That demand, all things considered, is not so hot. BOAC is puzzled by the re. luctance with which a Britain trading for its very future em- braces air freight as a partner. There never was a more diffident bridegroom. The big problem is not so much persuading a company to send a trial shipment by air but convincing it that the science of air freight-and that is what it really is-demands an entirely new approach. Generally speaking, air cargo is much more expensive than ea freight. It only becomes cheaper when an exporter tailors his productive, warehouse and sales organisation to its opportunities. Air freight saves on insurance and packing costs, it requires much less storage space because replacements can be obtained so quickly and since most big conurbations are served by at least one airport, it opens vast Snew markets to the exporter. It even eqables them, to take I advantage of sudden, short-lived fashion trends. Finally, air cargo /ives a distinctive system consistent with the technological advances of industry generally but it is not .easy to persuade industry that this is so. The airlines already do much I to educate exporting industries. E For a number of years at BOAC t we offered an adisory service r for any firm which sought it, t our experts quite often advising that existing air freight rates r were too high to be of use to r the firm concerned. * This, I believe, is now paying Sdividends. Last year the airline Scarried 30 per cent. more freight than it did the year before and the increase promises to be even Sgreater in the current year. The Srevenue from cargo now Samounts to about 10 per cent. Sos our total income. I said earlier that an airline could not afford to buy aircraft in the hope that it would one day carry big loads, but in fact this is what we all do- Scautiously. Cargo Terminal Last year, BOAC put Into Sservice two Boeing S30C I freighters and it is to buy f third r net year. It has built a .lrgo i terminal at Kennedy Arpot N New York, has extendd or modernised its facilities at Lon s don, Manohester and PrettWclk s airports and is planning a new, a automated warehouse for a Scargo centre which Is to be built I at Hethrow. t All this Involves many ml- lions of pounds but we believe it will be a profitable invest- 'ment.. It would not be right to blame British industry for all our problems. After all, we' have often, been hamfisted and inept in our- effort to provide a ser- vice, But we now, realise its.true potential, not only to Ouretives and the exporting industries but also to the country, SWhat we must now do it con- vince. British industry: that the vast \"home\" markets wvich they claim give their rivals in America. and Europe such a big advantage are really theirs as well if they adopt air freighting as a normal marketing tool.

   "article_dc_title" : "Dangerous to Relax",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-05",
   "text_content" : "By Sir GILES GUTHRIE CHAIRMAN, BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION A Boeing 747 as t will appear in BOAC livery. Loose discipline is of more 5 immediate danger to BOAC than C almost anything else over which i it has direct control. For several years we have a eeercised restraint and, now that we have extricated ourselves i from a morass of debt, it would t be natural to relax the discipline t we have practised so effectively. j It would also be disastrous. , The aura of profitability we now possess has been only I partly earned. The staff of( BOAC have - certainly worked diligently since the numbing I losses of the early 1960s, but we have been helped by circum- stances that may not recur. Increased Traffic Our accounts for the financial < year 1965.66 contain a wealth of interesting figures. It would be simple and convepient to draw attention to tbbse that show that BOAC carried 10.8 per cent. 4 more passengers than in the pre- 1 vious year--or increased cargo 1 traffic .4py 2J er cent--or pro- 1 ductivity by 16.4 per cent. The most significant, how. ever, are the statistics showing i how revenue yield per unit of traffic-the price we receive for our product-fell by 3.3 per < cent. Therein lies the danger 1 that BOAC will ignore at its peril. True the cost to us of pro- ducing a unit of capacity for sale fell even apTo-by,6.8 pe; i cent. But, while the revenue yield will probably continue to decline, the unit cost will, for the next five or six years, decrease only through the increasing efficiency of staff. The fact that in ten years we have been able to allow our traffic revenue per load-ton-mile to drop from almost 70 pence to just over 47 has been largely due to a succession of larger and larger aircraft offering pro- gressively lower operating costs. Culminating with the Boeing 707, each has worked harder, more economically, than its predecessor. But there are no new types of aircraft available to us until 1970, when the Boeing 747 enters service. And even then for two years: its immense capa- city and undoubtedly heavy introductory costs will minimise its direct cost effectiveness. Until 1970 the only additional passenger aircraft we are expecting will be Super VC0Os which, though popular with travellers, will be more expensive to operate than the. more economical types of 707s and DC8s our competitors will introduce. I said earlier that revenue yields are expected to fall in the coming years. There is con- tinuing pressure to reduce fares, though in real values these have fallen by more than half since 1946 when: the return fare from London to. New York was Even withut across-the-board tariff reductions, we expect that greater use of low promotional rates within existing fares struc- tures will result in lower revenue yield. We also believe that price levels-a combination of wages we pay and the cost of our materials and the services we buy-may rise by 3, 4 or more per cent. annually. Lower Fares With aircraft like the 707 having reached a plateau of pro. ductivity, with lower fares and rising price levels; BOAC will have no recourse but to depend on staff productivity to remain satisfactorily profitable until the early 1970s. We have in our favour the economics of size. As we grow larger our product - when measured in terms of capacity- ton-miles - becomes cheaper without increased effort by the individual, but this by itself will not be enough.' BOAC has to be more scien- tific in its commercial approach as well as in engineering and flight operations. Commercial and market re- search must become a scientific tool which guides 'the deploy- ment of salesmen and resources. Computers and automation will have to be employed to prevent manpower levels rising in step with the number of passengers we carry. The staff themselves will have to be directed to tasks which are essential rather than desirable. We must adopt a. approach to cargo which at least repays the effort and money we expend on its promotion. Above all else, we will have to sell more efficiently and fill aircraft more effectively. BOAC's break-even load factor has fallen steadily over the past ten years. It could now rise consistently until we reap the full benefits of the 747. So each point by which we can improve load factors is vitally important if we are to make profits and build reserves after provisions for the payment of interest and dividends to the Government. In the past two years we have rationalised the aircraft fleet, re- lated staff numbers more closely to. requirements and improved overall efficiency by casting aside unnecessary frills. The Government has removed from around our necks the financial millstone of past losses which was such a dispiriting burden to staff. If we now turn our attention to the use we make of our most precious asset, our staff, and ally their skills and enthusiasm to the sciences, we will remain profit. able-provided we serve the cardinal interests of passengers who want to be carried efficiently, comfortably and courteously and at the least pos- sible cost. Should we forget to do these things, the lesson of thrift we have learned so painfully will have been wasted.",

   "text_content" : "By Sir ANTHONY MILWARD CHAIRMAN, BRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS Last month BEA celebrated its 20th anniversary as a world airline. We can look back on two decades of substantial pro- gress, not only in terms of com- mercial advancement, but also in the field ,of technical know- ledge and competence. Anni- versaries are often occasions to look back on the past but if we in BEA had not always been looking ahead to the future there would have been nothing on which, with some justifica- tion, we could feel pride of achievement To-day, BEA stands as the fifth largest air carrier of pas. sengers in the world and the seventh in aircraft fleet size. In in the past twelve months we have at carred over 7m. passengers. ,y What is often forgotten is that we have achieved this in a com- re paratively small geographical ill area. Our network is dense and our sector length very short. Ld being on average only 320 er miles, rhrough careful and w prudent planning.

I port fares in Britain have in- I creased by over 160 per cent. on i the same basis. Our past per- formance has always been planned on three major objec- Â· tives: (a) safety, service and the Slowest possible economic fares Sfor our passengers; (b) stability, Ssecurity and the best possible working conditions for our staff; Sand (c) economy, efficiency and regularity of operation for our Sservices. SShort-haul Airline This *ias not been easy to Saccomplish for one principal reason, namely because all we Sstrive to do has to be done on 1 a very marginal basis. Ambitious e and grandiose plans are emi- * nently laudable, but we have t always borne in mind our objec- tive of standing on our own feet. I We have had to base, our plans d on the assumptions that, as an Sultra-short-haul airline, our re- D venue is small in comparison to I the numbers of passengers s carried. In airlines which have n an element of long-haul opera. I- tion the financial obligations of d the shorter sector operations are Seasier to bear, and most other European airlines have long h routes as well as short and, on e average, a larger amount of d money available to Cross- subsidise their unprofitable intra- . European routes. il The short-haul operator is be- a devilled with the problems of t. uneconomic aircraft utilisation f and poor aircrew productivity e which arise directly from the i- effects of high density opera- Stions over daylight hours. At- i tempts to improve utilisation by Sthe extension of night opera- I tions is now severely limited by Sthe capacity of Heathrow and Sthe restriction on night jet I movements owing to noise. SCommercially desirable depar- Sture and arrival timings are Smuch more critical on the short- I haul routes than on long-haul r ones. Because a service starting at 02.30 and finishing at 03.30 would have little attraction- even if operated at uneconomic fares-the utilisation of intra- European operators is consider- Sably below that of other areas as can be seen from the follow- Sing table of revenue hours oper- I s ated per day:- * SIntra-European ........ 61 r e North and Mid-Atlantic 10 i South Atlantic ........ 91 SEurope-Far East ...... 10 s North and Mid Pacific .. 11 I SSouth Pacific .......... 10 S Immediate Plans e In BEA we have to live with L this problem, but I am often Sunhappy to see even some of Sour more learned critics dismiss- 4 ing such factors as being of i g small account. Our task of n operating a large and expensive i Smodern fleet of aircraft calls for continual examination of the cost of operation. If we had not paid this attention to secur- Sing profitable operation I feel that BEA would have failed in n its public duty to the. taxpayer 4 Y years ago. S We look to the future with Sgreat confidence. Our immediate plans are to introduce a further fleet of long-range Tridents by 1968 and to augment this with jet aircraft which will replace our existing Viscount and Vanguard turbo-prop fleets. Since 1946 BEA's investment in British aircraft has been Â£177m. and up to the present time we have always bought what we consider has been the \"right\" aircraft for our type of operation. We, shall continue to do so, but, in all our deliberations .on the purchase of new aircraft. one point has been foremost in our minds-that is, the potential profitability of operation. This has meant that not only has the aircraft to satisfy us as regards range and performance but that it has to show itself as an economic proposition. In the past few years the biggest single factor holding back the British aircraft manufacturing industry has been, to my mind, the higt initial cost of production. Additional Costs In our economic investigatior of British against American air craft for a replacement Van guard/Viscount fleet this initial cost factor has weighed heavil5 against our natural desire tc purchase British aircraft. As ] have already said, our margir for profitable operation is smal -we cannot afford to take on manufacturers' developmeni costs in addition to a high basic cost aircraft. Our recommendations have been made to the Minister anc as everyone now knows the decision is that we continue tc buy British, but that some form of financial assistance will bi offered to compensate us for anj additional costs involved. Thii is in many ways eminently satis factory and BEA can bi relied upon once more to worl side by side with the manufac turers to produce the best an most economic aircraft possibli and aircraft which have a rca chance of world sale. Asman' people have said, however, thi is the one last chance for ou civil aircraft industry and we wil do all we can to help them builh a winner.",

   "text_content" : "By MICHAEL DONNE Our Mr Correspondent Progress on this side of the Atlantic- on the Anglo-French Concord 1,450 mph, 136-passen- ger supersonic airliner is now gaining momentum. The maiden flight of the first prototype, 001, is set for February 28, 1968, from Sud Aviation's airfield at Toulouse, to be followed within six months by the maiden flight of the second prototype, 002, Sfrom the British Aircraft Cor- poration's airfield at Filton, near Bristol. In both assembly centres recognisable flying machines are now beginning to take shape in the jigs. At the same time, the sales teams are moving round the world, slowly building up the order book, which now stands at 54 aircraft for 12 air. lines. Increasing Interest By the time the first prototype flies, this figure is expected to have been raised to at least 75 aircraft, and may be well on the way to the 100 mark. For as the Concord takes shape and the promise of supersonic civil avia- tion draws nearer to fulfilment. . so the airlines show increasing interest. At the time of writing, at least two more airlines were expected to add their names to the list, and several more orders were Sknown to be in negotiation. In the meantime, the British and French Governments are expected to announce soon the new revised total cost of the project. Currently officially set at Â£330m., or Â£140m. each for Britain and France, with another Â£50m. for development test-flying to certification, the new figure is expected to come to nearly Â£200m. each, comprising about Â£170m. each for the prototypes and two pre-production aircraft. and another Â£60m. for the de- velopment test flying. Order Book While this figure may appear Shigh, it must be borne in mind ' that it is spread over several Sys,trqolB l19\"2 to abottt 1971,. | that Ilready a subttantiai e amount of money has been spent h on the project. Also, by the t. time the prototype first flies, the N order book of, say, at least 75 n aircraft will be worth Â£375m. if I, all the orders are taken up at a i, price of Â£5m. per aeroplane. The Lt Concord shows promise of n making money. it In the meantime, the U.S. 4, manufacturers continue to move Salong with their own later but r bigger SST (supersonic trans. port) designs-the Boeing s swinging-wings\" aircraft, and e the Lockheed L.2000 \" Double n Delta \" aircraft, both planned to Scruise at 1,800 mph (Mach 2.7). d Pratt and Whitney and General SElectric are also hard at work on , the giant JTF-17A and GE-4 . engines to power these aircraft. By September 6 this year, all these manufacturers must submit their proposals for \"supersonic airliners and engines tb the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency. Then e will follow a period of intedse 0 analysis by the Government and 5 its appropriate hgencies, together .with the airlines, leading, it is e hoped, to the final selection of Sone of- the two airframe designs and one of the engine submis- sions for \"top priority\" proto- type manufacture. The cost of the U.S. supersonic transport programme is not known pre. it cisely, but it is estimated that by d the time the first prototype flies, t, in 1970-for airline service by e about 1974-some $2,000m. (over Â£700m.) is expected to have h been spent. e One of the major problems at e present in the U.S. Is determin. An arti t'I npireaio of the AngloFrench Concord spersonic airliner. iug how precisely the cost of the 1roject is to be-divided between the Government and industry. Currently, the feeling is that the Government will have to bear around 90 per cent. of the cost, with the industry carrying the re mainder. But potential sales of the U.S. supersonic airliner, whichever design is built, are ex pected to amount to well over Â£5,000nm through to the 1980s (the price per aircraft is likely to be around twice that of a Con- cord). Already, the Federal Aviation Agency, acting as \" banker ' in the absence of a firm manufacturing proramn e, holds \" reservations, lus cash deposits, for over 105 U.S. super- sonic airliners, from 23 airlines, and this figure is likely to rise as the programme gets moving. \"Variable Sweep\" Lockheed has already unveiled a 273-foot long plywood and plastic model of the mainly titanium L-2,000. Although this showed provision for 266 pas. sngers n five-abreast seating, the capacity will vary between 230.and 300 passengers. Gross take-off weight will be around 550,000 Ibs, and the aircraft's range will be around 4,000 miles non-stop on full payload. Boeing's SST will also carry up to about 300 passengers over 4,000-mile ranges, and it will have a gross take-off weight of about 600,000 lbs. The feature of this aircraft is that its wings will be capable of what is Sknown a. \"variable geometry\" or \"variable sweep,\" being ex- tended for low-speed flying at landing and take-off, and swept back at an angle of 72 degrees for supersonic flight. The struc- ture of the Boeing aircraft will also be mainly titanium-90 per cent, with 6 per cent. aluminium and 4 per cent. vanadium. Present Design The present Boeing design evolved through the analysis of nearly 500 different designs, in. cluding delta-wing airliners. Boeing began its studies in 1952, and by the time theU.S.-govern. ment sponsored competition began in 1964, the company's in. vestment in the SST was more than $15m. To-day, it stands at over S30m., in addition to Government funds. It is now becoming clear that whichever of the U.S. airliners is built, it will not supersede the smaller, slower Concord. The view is increasingly gaining ground that both types of air- liner will be able to live side by side on the world's air routes. Behind these contrasting designs on both sides of the Atlantic lies the work the Russians are doing on the Tupolev TU-144 supersonic transport. This will be about the same size as the Concord, with a similar design shape, and it is due into airline service at about the same time, in 1971. There can now be no doubt whatsoever that civil aviation is on the verge of a major new era.",

PAST 77 8S PRESENT FUTURE I --- I S 2 3 4 .- 6 HOURS S' LONWDOIN- PARIS COM PARI OP SINGLE JOURNEY TIM O AND FROM CITY CENTREI - -- --- ---- j _3 j~m~------- --- ---------- Air transport is one of the largest world industries, with business, in terms of passenger miles, doubling every five to six years. On long hauls, the future demand for subsonic jets will be met largely by America with existing developments and the jumbo jet. In addition, the stage is set for the introduction of the supersonic transport (SST). The major part of the traffic, however, will be on short. medium haul services carrying over 75 per cent. of all passen- gers. The emphasis will be on speed, convenience, reliability and safety. To date, although airliners have become more complex and expensive, in. creased speed has been accom- panied by reduction of fares in terms of real money. The air- borne part of the journey on short hauls has been reduced in time, but the overall time has not significantly improved. It has become increasingly difficult to reduce the overall journey time due to road saturation; and high-speed surface transport systems (for example, the electri. fled London-Manchester rail link) are again becoming com- petitive. Times Halved It is revealing that the fastest overall journey speed between the centres of London and Paris is only around 80 mph, using 600 mph jets. Nevertheless, the air remains the most flexible medium and, to maintain their position in future, relative to surface transport advances, the airlines must penetrate further into the urban area to minimise the ground journey, operating VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) from sites determined solely by community con- venience, and thereby halving total journey times. Faster runway-based aircraft, even supersonic, cannot offer any appreciable time reduction. The speed advantage of a VTOL system arises from (i) A shorter time in the air- craft due to the elimination of ground taxi-ing and of long take-off and landing paths, and the ability to cruise very fast low down. (ii) The elimination of the time- consuming land journey from the city centre to the airport with the attendant embarkation and dis- embarkation and seemingly inevitable waiting time. These advantages will be com- bined with higher reliability and safety standards. To-day, on short journeys, nothing is more frustrating than long periods of waiting in airports or in the air; and as traffic increases the air traffic control problem becomes significantly magnified. Conven. tional aircraft are inflexible, re- quiring long, shallow approach paths. In contrast, the VTOL aircraft offers a greater freedom, employing steep climb and approach paths and cruising in the air space below conventional aircraft. Full all-weather operation will be achieved by exploiting present developments in automatic land. ing and guidance. There can be adequate small alternates close to the city centre, and the possi- bility of holding on the ground, or-on a reserve landing-pad, in. stead of in the air. VTOL aircraft are inherently safe, especially in the terminal phases of the flight-the most accident prone- at present- since speeds close to the ground are very low and flight path control accurate. They can be I stopped in the air while a situa- r tion is reappraised. S The technical possibilities ' spread over a wide band from the helicopter's low-velocity lift system to high-velocity jet lift. VTOL is already established in Sscheduled helicopter operations; 1 but the helicopter is slow, com- i plex and uneconomic, and has I to be subsidised. We look to the Sfast, reliable, economic and acceptably quiet inter-city SVTOL vehicle. The field nar- Y -rows down to two high-speed a types-those with rotors which t are stopped or retracted for Snormal flight, and those using Slow-velocity lift fans. Turbo- prop .VTOLs suffer from in- Sherent complexity and limited i speed and development poten- I tFal. Noise is the most significant E problem limiting penetration Sinto the city; but already sub- r stantial reduction in fan noise, s demonstrated on advanced pro- Spulsion engines, shows promise - of achieving limits currently Sproposed. Additionally, there - are many sites, reasonably close in, where VTOL stations could i be sited in \" sterile\" areas, with I less stringent permissible noise I levels and gteater freedom of flight, path: for example, near 1 marshalling yards, rivers, docks, t etc. (Nine Elms is a typical * area.) Cost Analysis VTOL platforms could be over rail termini, having direct catchment, by suburban rail, Swith all services beneath the I operating area. These possibili- t ties must be.recognised to-day to I ensure that sites are not lost by I property development, and that i adjacent airspace :.4 not pene- i trated by high buldings. a ota system cost analysis shows that VTOL fares will be the same as current air services, and terminal costs considerably lower. The high-speed VTOL will be more expensive to buy but it will have higher produc- tivity, offering higher frequency of service and greater utilisa- f tion. Fare reductions are pos- sible with a new approach to ticketing, on the lines of rail or bus services. Scheduled helicop- ter operations already indicate that indirect costs can approach those of inter-city bus systems. Major Advances This important development demands a long-term national plan covering all aspects and intensified VTOL research. Any doubt about the future of VTOL in civil aviation in the next 15 years must be dispelled. Major technical advances such as the jet engine and the swept wing have been successfully exploited by the airline industry despite considerable initial scepticism as to the commercial outcome. Now supersonics are on the way and VTOL seems inevitable. The market potential in the early 1980s is enormous. It is not essential for a military pro= gramme to precede the civil which stands in its own right. The case is stronger than for the SST, since a far higher proportion of the community is served, offering a greater return of investment. The short-haul, high-density, European airline network is ideally suited for inter-city VTOL. This market alone offers an unparalleled oppor tunity for European collabora tion, exploiting European technology and the immense background of direct lift VTOL experience.",

   "text_content" : "By Sir MYLES WYATi CHAIRMAN, BRITISH UNITED AIRWAYS LIMITED cNrat frequent aily services tance in tDrindtno that the serves OaInw fmm Lnd\" Speculation still exists about the, future for the British inde- pendent airlines in competition .with the State corporations, especially in -tting up new routes and operations. Although the private operators have made considerable strides in recent years-entirely on their own intiative and without any effect on the business carried out by the corporations, other than beneficial - restrictions under which they are permitted to operate keeps them at a severe disadvantage. Before discussing the relation- ishi between the two sides of civil air transport, a definition Smust be made of just what the teim \" independents\" means in 1966. It certainly has far more significance than it had five years ago. In the later 1950s the inde- pendents were a scattered and, in some cases, malformed assort- Inent of small companies which, with a few exceptions, operated aircraft almost entirely on char- ter and contract work. In spite of the restrictions imposed by the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, 1960, which in theory gave the independents a \"new deal,\" the majority of companies in recent years by strenuous efforts and bold finance have managed to establish themselves as first- rate carriers, using modern equipment. Domestic Network No longer, if they ever did, do they deserve to carry the ' paper and string\" charter slur. The independents are of varying size and stature; they range from relatively small and basically U.K. operators right through the scale to British United, with its - comprehensive international and domestic network. Although the leading indepen- dents are now permitted to run scheduled services, the licences which determine the scope of these operations are very strictly limited. They restrict the fre- quency of flights, must normally be renewed about every seven years and lay down the type and capacity of aircraft to be used. The extremely tight rein which is kept on the scope of private air- -line services creates marketing S,:itoblems far thoseaompanies.- Setting up an efficient sales organisation is a near impossi- bility under such circumstances which allow one carrier to -CHAIRMA operate frequent daily service over a route and its aok-ld competitor perhaps two or t times a wek. On the otthr the corporation .have licences with a no rtrictfoai often their operatlonl are cqrtfd out under pooling arragemen with foreign national airlin which tend to nullify the effec of international competition. Broader Basis There is no doubt that th traveliug public in particur, the Corporations themselves, as well as the independents, could benefit from a much broader basis of competition. It should never be forgotten that in striv ing to overcome these obstacles to healthy economic develop ment the independents have made important contributions to the growth of air transport and have been major supporters of the British aircraft and aero engine manufacturing industry. Consideration of the future of the independent operator i competition with the Corpora tions, unless it is to be little less than crystal ball gazing, must be based on Government policy This accepted, it must be admit ted that the prospects are non- too bright. Two measures have been introduced by the present Government, both of which one more than the other-seem destined to be detrimental to th- prospects of the private comr panies. The least discouraging of the two innovations was the accep Pasengers boarding a British United Airways' BAC One Eleven at Glasgow's Abbotinbch Airport. icn ied teo opeate rlar serydce in directcompetition with a Corporation.. Thin de* pendents, it seeni, v st leek new Iroutes,,or petrOap-as British United have dope on the Britain/South Amieri a net- work-take over thwa surren- dered by theCorpormnin. So, while the private airlines face what could eventually amount to a ban.on anyform of scheduled service competition, other than between themselves, the highly protected nationalised airlines are given a free hand to compete for trooping and contract work. Trooping is a low revenue earning operation. with contract time limits and does not aid long-term expansion, but it has, and should continue to pro. vide, useful employment for private-enterprise companies. Restricted Flights At present, while competition with the State airlines does exist on a very limited basis, con- tioversy has centred round the British domestic trunk routes. Operating a very restricted number of flights, which is laid down in their licence, my com- pany serves Glasgow, Edin- burgh and Belfast from Gatwick Airport, London; British Eagle s British d srvces from SGatwick are cbAplanemtay, and -especially provide the South-at and South, London withmo'sa vomvofent air travel. They. havew brought jet speed and comfort to the domestic scene and given reater signifi- cance to Oatwick, a modern, Â£1ll1. which the i Goverment ow seems likely r to o o some lengths to develop I arnpromote. Tie independent services have undoubtedly Sraised the standards of internal I air transport and provided the. I competitive incentive which I invariably does so. much to i improve service t6 the public. SPrivate airlines have developed t short-range scheduled routes t based on different a1eas of SBritain, in. some ca ierited r from BEA. It should also be possible for the independents to promote still further the growth of air routes direct from provin- cial ceatres to the Continent and Selsewhere. This development can t be achieved without breaching the Government's indicated 5 policy that no two British airlines will be licensed to operate on a regular basis over the same route. The private concerns have opened up new markets with inclusive-tour holiday services, Sonly to be refused permission, in Sfavour of a Corporation, to run scheduled services. over the newly-developed routes. Immense Value Already the private enterprise contribution to British air trans- port has been of immense value to the country whether in the form of opening new fields of operation, saving old ones, sup- porting industry or enhancing the reputation of the best in, British aircraft. This progress, achieved in a generally difficult and discouraging political atmo- sphere, has harmed the national- ised Corporations in no way whatsoever. Their recent highly satisfactory financial results would seem to testify to this. Coniiolled extension of com- petition will hurt no one any the more. Regrettably there are few signs of its appearing in the near future.",

JOHN SUPERINTENDENT, BLIND LANDING EXPERIMENTAL UNIT The predicted rapid increase nl civil air traffic will not be refliled until regular and safe operation in all weathers is pos- sible, Current operations in present weather limits are not safe enough and the psycho- logical impact of an accident to an aircraft with 500 or more passenogrs should provide stlmu- lus to aim for greater safety in the future. The Air Registration Board has proposed a safety target, for all.weatber landing systems, of not more than one fatal accident in 10m. landings, This Is a most stringent safety requirement, but certainly not excessively so if one accident can involve 1,000 passengers. There is, therefore, an urgent need to tackle the problems of landing safely In all weathers Automatic Systems The techniques Involved in automatic landing systems whose performance is unaffected by any single failure are now well eItab. ished, The BBA Trident which In June, 1965, became the first aircraft in regular passengr. carrying service to be ertlficated by the ARB for automatic con. trol to touchdown, was designed from the start to be capable of fully automatic blind landing, The VC.0 flight control system bas a similar capability. Automatic landing is, In fact, just round the corner but the development of airborne Instru. ment aids' Is far ahead of the provislon of a suitable airport environment, and there Is a large programme of work to be com. pleted before sae allweather landing can become a reality. Thil involves, in particular, fur' th,' Investigatlon Into Ihe rQle of the pilot and the Â«olllti needed for an \"all.wther\" ilrprt. ,. former cover all tyo. of piloting problems, Inoludlni uttomeo 1112ht ,ontrol yst,m.

The provylion of a suitable environment into which an aircraft can operate safely involves the management and operation of the whole airport and surrounding airspace. Some of the new techniques being in. vestigated, many as part of Oov. ernment research programmes, are described briefly below. It has been agreed inter. nationally that the use of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) should continue until at least 1975, and it has already been demonstrated that ILS is capable of giving the perform. ance required for automatic landing. For landing in poor visibility, however, more is needed, as it is necessary both to achieve the required reliability and also to detect, and if possible minimise, interference with the ILS signals, While adequate continuity of service can be assured, the prob- lems relating to interference are still boing investigated by the Radio Department of the RAE who have, In addition, developed a new type of locallser *erolal which could significantly reduce the effeot of interference duting the final approach, This ltech nlque, known as the downwind locallser. Is now being tested at RAE Bedford, where a 400-foot linear array has been sited near the approach end of the runway. Nols Problems ILS llows ixaed direction, stralTlnea approach only, but In eonlrlns guidanceo systems for future erminal areas, curved approsah paths may be advantageous, and consideration is also bling given to stper approach pahthan wan be pro, vadedby II, in th hoape of ltlvlpt|1g\" nb M problem , A trackIn adalt ficllity ha re. osntly n talled It I t and I th A wI mentayto p de di piths 0 any rquilred sad or oth Onvrtlooual and VUT9L alirrft, ' Slidle4901,11 not 61 4 sfa found t brin the lrevakTaÂ»ely to a stop on Whq runway and to tai It tothe apon, At present Ights are use fopr aU t.'MO vehiol which are cofIn tef o paved areas but, for very low visibility conditions, non.visual guidance will be necessary, and trials are at present in progress by the Blind Landing Experi. mental Unit using a single magnetic leader cable. Using such a technique, with the add. tion of detectors spaced along the runways and taxiways, it should be possible to develop a system of ground control very similar to that used on the rail. ways, the presence of an aircraft or vehicle in a section being in. dicated by a lamp on a display board. Rescue Vehicles Special techniques will be needed by fire , and rescue vehicles which must have free. dom of movement over the air- field. Use of n1,rtlai tohniques has been succesfull 'demon. strated. but some f o.intl collision warning will be noesl sary, and both frequenoy.modu. lation radar and sonar techniques are being Investigated for this purpose by RR, Malvern. Better meteorological tech- hlques are required to measure witd strength and turbulence as well as visibility, Turbulence affects automatic landing perfor. mance and the human pilot needs better information about visibility conditions in the ilnd. Inj area. In current operations, the visual range Is measured by a human operlaor along the sur. face of the runway, and this runway visual range is used as a basis for defnlng operating weather limits, For operation in lower vial, bility conditions because the structure of fog Is not uniform, either horitontally or vertically. more complex measlrelment will/ be le5o to t noure fr exaplep, that the viSibIlity doie not fal below the state mini. mum at any point alonl the runway, a 1any. moulrse. men .Io .he toesÂ¶ prio OIani Th2 auto ,1 ma remuti ofl runway volt r ang at Iultipl itoti u olvll Invitll31d0 nd l t1h, sk 08 lt nique to measure slant visual range is under development. Many new techniques will need to be developed before air- craft can operate regularly in. all-weather conditions, but there remains the difficult problem of proving that the .lndlng system, at a whole, ratisfies the require. ment that a fatal accident shall not occur more than once in 10m. landings. With such an astronomical figure, it is imprac- tical to demonstrate beforehand with any confidence that the safety target will be met, and the initial clearance can only be basd on a combination of good design, enineering judgment and the statnttcal aissesment of limited, but realistic, testing. Clearance for uie it lower visibilities can only be given fol lowing a period In service in good weather conditions during which statistical evidenoe will be collected on the performance and integrity of the system. A system has recently been pro. posed and invetlated by the BLEU using sleimic detectors to record the positlon of a landing aircraft, and thin technique could be uied In all' weather conditions so that, 'over the years, evidence would be accu. mulated to confirm that the per. formance achieved is adequate and so validate the design of the complete system.

The second.iathat oi acpimmer- cial business'with an obligation tb achieve a \"satisfactory return on the public capital. invested in the-airports. These t o responsibilities might, in some ways,,besaid to be counficting. And yet, in the economic world in which we live, .ay. really successful enter- prise must achieve its success through a .blnd of service to customers and of satisfaction to shareholders. When both the customers and the.shareholders are the public at large these re- quirements are all the. more important; combined with accountability to Parliament as a spur and an obligation as well. Expanding Traffic, Certainly the British Airports Authority is tackling its tasks with these two responsibilities as its primary guide-lines. And in domig so, we have both the advantages and the disadvan- tages of working in a sphere of rapidly expanding traffic. The I advantage is that business-and , hence revenue-is .growing at a steady pace. The disadvantage is that we are continuously m danger of being swamped by the traffic demands. In any case, the growth, in both passenger and cargo traffic increases the difficulty of providing the better service for the travelling public and the cargo shippers which we regard as a primary obligation. That, nevertheless, is the en- vironment in which, we must operate and in which we have to order our affairs. And it brings with it two, further, underlying points-as well as a host of detail. On the, one hand we have major matters of policy towards our British airports as the gate- ways to Britain-and, indeed, to An aerial view of Heathrow Airport, showing in the foreground partially completed piers from Nos. 1 and 2 passenXer terminals. On the right Is the area now being developed for the new No. 1 passenger terminal, and to the left the skeleton piers outside No. 3 passenger terminal. Europe. On the other, we are tc developing management tech- st niques which are essential, but E new, to airport affairs., re On the policy side, perhaps the tl most important issue is how our al airports shall be developed so as ci to cope with the traffic which c seems certain to evolve, looking it a generation ahead. Upon deci- sions taken now will depend fg whether this country-whatever ti its other tribulations-becomes w a junction point through which a the world's air traffic will flow; p or merely a siding off the main a air routes. 1 P Stepping Stone t Geographically the British to Isles in general-and London in g particular-are well placed as a stepping stone between the p Americas, Europe. Asia and the I Orient. London itself is one of f the world's great centres for e both business and tourism. If t we can provide efficient and c well-run airports, capable of a handling expeditiously the f world's most demanding aircraft r and their no-less-demanding t loads-and of transporting them I quickly and comfortably both ( to the city centres and to the surrounding countryside-then England and Scotland will remain not only at the centre of the world's airways map but also at the centre of world commerce, now moving in- creasingly and predominantly into the air. The fact is that-on present forecasts--the demands for traffic through London's airports will grow from 12m. passengers and 200,000 tons of cargo in the past year, to 24m. passengers and 500,000 tons of cargo in 1971 and to more than 50m. passengers and around 2m. tons of cargo annually by the end of the '70s. We have to plan now to cope with these tremendous growths during the next decade. Certainly three London air- ports are going to be needed if Britain is to remain in the fore- front of world trade. Equally, each of these airports will have to be developed as centres of complete networks of radial services if they are to play their full part. Otherwise road and rail communications will be blocked by exasperated \"inter- lining\" traffic. Heathrow and Gatwick are both well placed to ie serve London and, different, mn segments of the Home Counties. ill The third London airport must, of in due course, be so placed as at not to conflict with these two Id and to serve the segment round a- London least catered for at ly present-while remaining not too remote from the city centre. at Nor must we ever relax our or concern or the interests of is those who live around our rs present or future airports. ie s Major Issues in n. These then are among the as first of the major policy issues of affecting the future-remember- iw ing also that the chief provincial us cities, such as Manchester and le. Glasgow, must each have their ir- own major airports as the if centres of future radial services e- and that municipal airports in ly, the Home Counties-such as ve Southend and Luton-also have of an important role for the future. ial A national airport policy is .ir clearly of high significance to ad our national planning and be prosperity in the years ahead. .r- As important, are the other ad transport links of which the to airports are focal points. Good access from and to the airports from the city centres which they serve is, of course, axiomatic. With the growth of traffic it is increasingly clear that such access needs to be provided both by road and by rail-by road to make possible the wide distribu- tion required by about 50 per cent. of the traffic-by rail to cater for the other half which requites rapid and comfortable transport to the city centre. For Heathrow there is a powerful case for both a non-stop rsrface rail link to Victoria, which could be reached in 20 minutes or so, and for an extension of the Piccadilly Line from Hounslow West to the airport. More than 20m. passengers a year, and a large working population at the airport, will require these services in the 1970s. Traffic Flow Gatwick is already well served by rail-and will be better so served shortly. There, the need is for a good ancillary road link, by means of a spur off the planned Brighton Motorway. However forward looking these policy points, they must be supported by efficient and effec- tive management techniques in what is both a \"capital inten- sive \" business and an operation which must be geared to high rates of traffic flow. at, In the past, airports have been 's. managed on, largely, a \"cash st, flow\" basis. Control and fore- as casting of cash flow remains no vo less important but these checks ad and balances must be allied at closely to properly ordered trad- lot ing accounts and a detailed re. system of forecasting and bud- ur getary control, both on the day- of to-day trading side and on that ur of capital spending. Such systems are being put in by the Authority and detailed monthly statements of profit and loss are now available to management. he The airports will be run as a eis business and must be controlled er- as such. ial And so, with all these issues nd before us, with new \"Jumbo eir Jets\" and supersonic transports he looming upon the horizon, with :es international as well as national in responsibilities, we come back as -as I said at the start-to the ve two underlying requirements- re. to render an efficient public ser- is vice both to the travelling pub. to lic and the air carriers and to nd achieve a satisfactory return on the capital invested. There is ier certainly a sizeable job to be :he done. We are tackling it-both od in planning and in operation.",

   "text_content" : "By KNUT HAMMARSKJOLD DIRECTOR GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION The international air transport industry to-day is a very large one indeed and is still expanding at a tremendous pace. The scheduled airlines of the world have operating revenues running at the rate of Â£3,500m. a year. They have about three. quafters of a million people on their payroll and operate over 5,700 transport aircraft-about a quarter of them jets. The growth rate of the inter. national sai transport industry shows no sign of ilackening. The Increase i passenger traffic is steady but that in freight traffi is nothing short of dramatic. Last year the world's scheduled airlines carried 27 per cent. more oaro than in 1964. It eemes quite lelyt that in ten years irfreiht will account for onequarter of their total traffic. In service today alongside their paesener carrying twins are 1ant t freighters capable of iftlngloads approaching 100,000 pounds.

These design objectives essen. tially represent a three-point goal to ensure that: (1) the level of safety afforded by the SST must be at Ieast equal to that of sub. sonic aircraft operating at the time it is introduced into service; (2) the SST must be adaptable to air traffic control facilities so that it Is capable of integration vith subsonic aircraft; (3) the SST must be comparable with subsonic aircraft in such areas as economics and acceptable in relation to potential operating mlmitation due to noise or sonic boom, The third point is of great importance to the public, which is particularly interested in the effect on fares that any new aircraft may have. There has been much recent talk about high capacity jets bringing lower fares, Although these aircraft are claimed to have direct ,operating costs as much as 30 per cent, lss than those of exist. Ing jets, this does not mean that 30 per cent. lower fares will result as non-operating costs will have to be covered, Moreover the high capacity jets capital charges will be very high and the new aircraft must ylld sufficient returni to meet the Interest chargea-\" very illnlfl' Ocat non.opefating expens Item, Load Facton It hardly needs saying that to be economially sucessful the 1high apt y jt must be operated wi1 Mtl slotory 1le !otots.

With all indirect costs rising sharply, it would seem unwise for the world airline industry to make forecasts about possible fare reductions through the use of the new aircraft. A particu- larly uncertain operating cost item for carriers is landing charges, which have almost doubled in recent years and now, on average, represent some 5 per cent. of total inter. national airline operating ex- penses, and for some airlines on certain routes as much as 10 per cent. of operating expenses, IATA's studies on the economic aspects of both the SST and hglh-capacity aircraft have been somewhat hampered by the lack of information on the future trend of airport charges. Ground Delay There are also gaps In IATA's Information on certain Sother aspects assoclated with the operation of the new types of aircraft. In some cases the solu. tion of the problem Is outside IATA's direct control. For example, passenger and freilht handlig problems for the big aircraft have to be tackled by airport authorities and Govern. mimel as well as by the airlines. One particular area where IATA seeks the understanding of Governments, Is In the reduc. tion of passport and Customs formalities, If the public Is to derive full benefit from the high.

Te I ticketing system for the hlghaopacity jets should be one that reduces to the absolute t lnlmum the airport check-in formalities for the passenger. Airline traffic experts are cona stantly studying ways and means of reaching this goal. One major source of delay Is the present requirement that al baggage for international flights be weighed. The question of whether or not some llberallia. tlon of bagigae allowances for International flI hts is feasible will be debated at the IATA Composite Trafm Conferences Meeting which opens in Honolulu on September 12. Ground handling is also a very important matter in the airlines' fast developing cargo business.

   "text_content" : ".By Sir ERIC MENSFCÂ¶H, CHAIRMAN- WMTLMAWf AMCCRAP? ItMIrmn More than 2,000 helicopters are in civil operation in the Western world. They are em- ployed as private aircraft, by corporations as executive trans- port machines, on a charter basis for many commercial tasks and (a few only) as scheduled pas- sengr airliners. The companies operating hell. copters for chater have achieved considerable commercial success and are expanding their opera- tions. .The aircraft make a profit for their petors by perform- ing tasks which, if achIevable at all by other means, would be considerably more costly both in time and money. The helicopters operating schedWed passengera rryin ser. vices are in a mnorty and are usually operated plying between points where surface transport 'has a geographical handicap such as a water crossing. On such routes they are showing a profit dependent upontAe traffic density and the prmin that passehter* are prepi dto pay for speed and the avoid ce of several changes of vehicle or a rough sea crossing. Return Journey An example of such an opera- tion is the British European Air- ways service between Penzance and the Scilly Isles, using nomi- nally 25-seater helicopters. The alternative transport between the Isles and the mainland is a boat which does the return journey , daily and normally takes nearly three hours each way but. de- pending on the state of the sea, 1 may take much longer. The single fare is 40s, or about Is 2d per mile. In contrast, the 1 journey time by helicopter is about 20 minutes and the single fare is 54s, or Is 6d per mile. Limited expansion of such ser- ] vices can be foreseen. i The real future expansion of ; helicopter services, however, i will take place on the high density routes between major cities and between international airports and the areas which they serve. This is because only the helicobter or its derivatives I offer that drastic shortening of city centre-to-city centre times so much needed now and in the 1 future. Furthermore, this can I be dpe with a machine which \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t economically meets modern safety standards-and is suffi- ciently quiet. Before such ser- vices can be realised, however, the costs and fares must be con- siderably reduced. Ticket costs are influenced by the following major issues: 1. Load Factor-a low break- even load factor coupled with a reasonably high operating load factor (say 70-80 per cent.) is the ideal combination. The aircraft must also be capable of carrying a full passenger load in safety. Load Factors On high density routes (say London - Paris, London - Man- chester) adequate operating load factors are assured, provided the fare level is acceptable. Hitherto this has not been the case, and tus, th lon-awaited * ***' ' ****' ^ ' : * * ** truly commercial inter-city heli- copter service has not yet arrived. How to achieve much better productivity and at the same time lower maintenance costs is the problem to be. solved. Operation from small sites in the centre of cities demands that, in order not to be restricted to carrying a reduced number of passengers, the aircraft be capable of hovering at its normal operating weight follow- ing the failure of' an engine. Most helicopters currently in service, because they are derived from military aircraft that accept a measure of risk, do not have this level of performance fol- lowing an engine failure, and in such operations they are re- stricted to carrying considerably fewer passengers than there are seats available.
