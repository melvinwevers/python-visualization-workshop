HARSH economic measures in the Soviet Union, including a cut in wages and an immediate restriction in the money sup ply, will be announced shortly according to Mr Arkady Vol sky, deputy chairman of the Committee for the Manage- ment of the National Economy. Mr Volsky's warning came as leaders of the Soviet repub- lics attempted to thrash out an economic agreement which could mitigate the effects of the impending economic crisis. The Congress of People's Deputies, the highest Soviet legislative body, will vote on the agreement. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet presi- dent, said yesterday that 11 IM A'* a republics had indicated their support for agreement to cre- ate a common economic policy. The four-strong economic committee, appointed last week, is now the closest body to a Soviet government, follow- ing the dismissal of the former cabinet of Mr Valentin Pavlov, the former prime minister arrested for his part in the August 19 coup. Mr Volsky, head of the employers' organisation, the Scientific and Industrial League, said that the state bank had warned Mr Gorba- chev that the country was on the verge of financial collapse. A conference on Friday, con- vened by Mr Volsky with the Teim Pak Ale-Level Group, Ii Swedish ood pro-essing mind pkagling company, is to ask wester governmenlt tor booking of l1bn (Â£50m) a yer to help dvelop the Soviet tood packaging and dlitrbutlon system.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens and Leyla Boulton in Moscow THE LEADERS of a disintegrating Soviet Union were told yesterday by Mr John Major that large-scale western aid depended on the creation of a coherent struc- ture of economic management by the republics. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, urged the west to step up economic assis- tance. Offering an optimistic assessment of the prospects of a new union treaty to link the republics, he told Mr Major that the failure of last month's coup underlined the success of his policies of perestroika. \"Now is the time for the west to support us,\" he added. After a day of talks with Mr Gorbachev and with Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Rus- sian Federation - who yester- day accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Britain - Mr Major said he had found clear agreement on all sides within the Soviet Union that the common interest lay in the promotion of \"democracy and stability\". Mr Gorbachev and Mr Major - the first western leader to visit Moscow since the failed coup - agreed that there could be no going back on reforms which should now accelerate. Mr Major avoided any hint of favouritism towards either of his two principal hosts. There appeared little doubt, however, that while he is keen that Mr Gorbachev's authority THE SOVIET UNION 0 Gorbachev stresses need for economic accord, Page 2 0 Major must tread carefully on visit to China, Page 4 5 Editorial comment: Death of the god that failed; Observer, Page 12 * Soviet president accepts Baltics' Independence, Page 14 * Justinian, Page 30 should not collapse any fur- ther, Britain fully recognises the powerful position of Mr Yeltsin. At an impromptu press con- ference after meeting Mr Yelt- sin, Mr Major said they had discussed strengthening Rus- sia's direct ties with the west. But he nodded approvingly as Mr Yeltsin declaimed any ambitions for a Russian empire and said he would support Mr Gorbachev at today's meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies. At the meeting, Mr Gorbachev is to announce plans for joint armed forces under civilian leadership and the creation of a \"single eco- nomic space\" for the republics, cemented by the preservation of a single currency. Continued on Page 14 In his talks with Mr Gorbat chev and Mr Yeltsin, the Brit- ish prime minister voiced west. ern concern that the Soviet nuclear arsenal should remain under central control. Last night Mr Major said he had won assurances that the pres- eat structure of control would remain. The British leader, who had two separate meetings with Mr Gorbachev, said his calls for sharp cuts in Soviet defence expenditure had met with simi- lar assurances that the need for large reductions was \"expected acknowledged and anti-up.teV. Mr Major, the present chr- man of the Group of Seven industrialied a voiced the western governments' fears that the pace of political change could slow the momentum of economic reform. Mr Nigel Wicks, the British official co-ordinating the Ga's approach, was staying on in Moscow for consulta- tions. a Mr Major urged the Soviet and Russian leaders to appoinat high-level representatives to negotiate immediately with teams from the International Monetary Fund to map out reform programmes. During a visit in which his aides freely admitted that he had mare questions thani e- criptions, Mr Major under laed his Iupport for the forces of change by meeting leaders from the newly independent Baltic states and by laying a wreath for the three Russians killed during the coup. Mr Major told Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian chairman of the committee overseeing economic reform, that the Soviet Union must avoid economic rivalries between the republics which would undermine any reform pro- gramme.

The motion is to be proped by Mr Arthur Scargil,presi- dent of the National Union of Mineworkers, and calls for the repeal of all anti-union legisla- tion. The TGWU's decision yester- day came as Labour sought to shrug off the first Tory lead in the opinion polls for six months.

Large unions, including the Nalgo public service union and the MSS general technical union, are among those who will vote in favour. But a motion broadly in line with Labour's plans for retain- ing ballots before strikes and compulsory elections of union officials is certain to be sup ported by most unions. This Is eing proposed by Mr Ron Todd, general secretary of the TGWU, the general workers' union. Some supporters of Mr Scar- gill's motion argued that its approval would not necessarily have meant a fundamental challenge to. Labour because the phrase \"all anti-union\" would not necessarily apply to all Conservative party legisla- tion, including that on ballots and elections.

   "article_dc_title" : "Ministry Accuses Nomura over Share Dealings",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagatyl in Tokyo THE Japanese Ministry of Finance has confirmed it sus- pects Nomura Securities, the stockbroking group, of having manipulated shares for the benefit of a gangster organisa- tion. The allegation is one of the most serious to come out of the scandals which have engulfed the Japanese securi- ties markets and which have forced the resignations of Nomura's former chairman and president. Mr Nobuhiko Matsuno, director-general of the minis- try's securities bureau, told a parliamentary committee on Saturday that the ministry suspected Nomura of having manipulated stock in Tokyu Corporation, a railway and property company, to profit Inagawakal, a criminal organi- sation. His statement seems hard to reconcile with the sworn evidence given last week by Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, the former Nomura chairman, who said the company had not broken the law concerning stock manipulation. Nomura's dealings with the gangster group in 1988-89 form a main element of the securities market scandal. Nomura and Nikko Securi- ties, another leading house, have admitted lending money through subsidiaries to compa- nies controlled by Mr Susumu Ishii, the former head of Ina- gawakai. Nomura has also admitted dealing ii shares on Mr Ishii's behalf, including the purchase of a large amount of Tokyu stock in early 1989. Mr Tabuchi admitted these points in his sworn testimony. He also conceded that, after Mr Ishii bought his stock, Nomura bought Tokyu stock in big volumes on behalf of other customers. He said these dealings had been excessive, but denied the purchases amounted to an Illegal attempt to manipulate the market. Between August and Novem- ber 1989, Tokyo shares soared from around Y1,000 (Â£4.36) to Y3,000, bringing a huge paper profit to Mr Ishii. The disclosure that the min- istry suspects Nomura of hav- ing manipulated stock is cru- cial because the other activities which Nomura has admitted are not against the law. Dealing with gangsters is, in itself, not illegal - nor is paying stock loss compensa- tion to favoured clients, the Continued on Page 14 Nomura Continued from Page 1 other main element of the scandal. However, Mr Mat- suno's comments do not amount to a formal charge against Nomura. Meanwhile, Mr Ryntaro Hashimoto, the Japanese finance minister, has announced a five-point plan to help restore confidence in the country's scandal-ridden financial markets. Mr Hashi- moto on Saturday told the same parliamentary commit- tee that the proposals would aim to improve the transpar- ency of the securities markets, reinforce inspection and super- visory systems, emphasise the principle of investor responsi- bility, review administrative regulations and impose stiffer penalties on transgressors. The ministry is having to fend off calls for the establish- ment of an Independent super- visory organisation on the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Officials are working on reforms which would fit into Mr Hashimoto's broad catego- ries, but have yet to announce specific plans. Their ideas include possibly creating a new supervisory unit within the ministry to oversee both securities and banking, as well as plans for increased supervi- sion for securities compales. Mr Hashimoto sad his five- point plan would mprove the Integrity of the securities mar- kets. The scandals had not only undermined general investor trust in the market but also created a sense of unfairness among the public. * More signs have emerged of the ipact of the current poor trading conditions, caused partly by the scandals, on kei Shimbun, the business da*ly, yesterday eprted the results of a survey which showed that the pre-tax roet of the i our oen - No- maraa,D lwa, M d Ta m- aluhi - coud fall by aa per cent for the s uo to the enl of .aember",

   "text_content" : "-y Arlano Genillard in Baku, Azerbaijan THOUSANDS of protesters rallied around the government building in the Azerbaijan cap- ital yesterday, in an attempt to force out the Communist authorities in the republic. More than 30,000 supporters of the nationalist Azerbaijan Popular Front gathered to call for the dismissal of the repub- lic's pro-Union president, Mr Ayaz Mutalibov. They were also demanding cancellation of the presidential elections due next Sunday. Mr Mutalibov is now the sole presidential can- didate since Mr Zerdutch Ali- zade, leader of the small Social Democrat Party, decided to withdraw in protest from the race. The Popular Front is boy- cotting the elections. 'The leadership clearly did not condemn the coup, and we must do everything we can to stop them' Mr Mutalibov was, mean- while, meeting the Soviet presi- dent, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, in Moscow, in an attempt to obtain guarantees that Soviet troops would not leave the republic's territory. \"Until we have our own forces, the Soviet army is the sole guarantee of stability in our republic,\" Mr Oznam Merzoiev, adviser to the president, explained. The republic's leaders have been warning that the two- year-old conflict between Azer- baijan and Armenia in and around the two republics' bor- ders could intensify if Soviet troops in the area withdraw. The nationalist banner has been waved recurrently by the republic's leadership since it found itself weakened for fail- ing to condemn the attempted coup in Moscow. Last Friday, the republic's parliament, which has an over- whelming majority of Commu- nist deputies, declared Azerbai- jan's independence, the sixth republic to do so, a surprising move as its leader had always been pro-Moscow. It also lifted the state of emergency declared after the bloody inter vention of Soviet troops in the capital in January 1988. Despite the leadership's nationalist attitude, the opposi- tion leaders, who drew big sup port over the past three years with nationalist slogans, have stepped up their action against the republic's leaders. \"The leadership here clearly did not condemn the coup, and we must do everything we can to stop them,\" Mr Abufass Eltch- ibe, president of the Azerbai- jani Popular Front, said. Mr Mutalibov, who for a week has appeared in public speaking Azeri, the local lan- guage, resigned from the post of general secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist party last Wednesday. But he has shown no intention of banning the party's activities in the republic. Instead, the Commu- nist party may try to change its name during its annual con gress due on September 21."

Only the three Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Turk- menistan and Uzbekistan, with the giant Russian republic, have not declared indepen- dence. At least three - Ukraine, Moldova and Belorussia - have also foreshadowed the establishment of national armies or guard corps. Mr Mircea Snegur, Moldovan president, said at the weekend that fears over the power of Russia dictated rapid local action in, three areas - the organistion of the security servces (the former republican KGB), the formation of a national guard, and the intro- duction o its own currency. Even in Belorussia - tradi- tionally Athe most quiescent and pro-Moscow of the repub- lics, and ethnically and liigu.s- tically closest to Russia - there is now the possibility cf an ind ndent armed forma- tion. Colonel-General Anatoly Kostenko, commander of the Belorussian military district, said that a national guard could be created to \"protect the republic's sovee ty, enforce law and order and guard stra- tegic installations\". At the same time, Mr Gorba- chev seems unable to persuade one of the Central Asian lead- ers, Mr Askar Akayev, Kirghis president, to accept his offer of the vice-presidency. The Inter- fax news agency quoted Kirghz officials yesterday as saying that he \"cannot leave his current post\".",

   "text_content" : "By Chrysta Freeland in Kiev MR LEONID Kravchuk, leader of the Ukraine, the second most powerful republic in the Soviet Union, yesterday declared the Soviet superpower dead. Mr Kravchuk used the occa- sion of the 50th anniversary of the brave, but unsuccessful, defence of Kiev from the Nazi- to celebrate the Ukraine's dec- laration of independenqp on August 24. \"The union which we had is ruined. To hope to rebuild it through some collec- tive efforts is unrealistic,\" Mr Kravchuk told an audience of Soviet army recruits and Sec- ond World War veterans. In line with the pact between the Ukraine and Russia last week, Mr Kravchuk said it was still possible and desirable to main- tain an economic union and shared defence. But he hinted at irritation with Mr Yeltsin's newly self- confident Russia, which last week suggested it might want to revise its borders with other republics, including the Ukraine. \"We can and should work together with Russia,\" Mr Kravchuk said, \"but to be together we must be equal.\" He stood beneath a towering Brezhnev-era iron Amazon, known derisively as the \"old bag\", but at the end of his speech the Red Army band played a hymn of the Ukraine's sharp-shooter units who fought for independence in 1917-18. Under Brezhnev, to sing it was a crime. Mr Kravchuk's address was part of a concerted campaign to win over the historically pro-Union military to the cause of Ukrainian independence. Last Thursday, Ukrainian gov- ernment leaders met the gener- als who command Soviet forces in the Ukraine. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign afairs, said most of the generals agreed to be sub- sumed under control of the Ukrainian government. Today, the Ukrainian parlia- ment is to appoint one of the generals as Ukrainian defence minister. He will then begin negotiating with Russia about which units should form the new Ukrainian national guard and which be part of a collec- tive defence force. Mr Pav- lychko said the Ukraine, which with Kazakhstan and Russia, has nuclear weapons on its ter- ritory, has agreed to hand these over to Russia.",

The concert, funded by the Lithuanian government, took place as Soviet President Mik- hail Gorbachev said he was ready to accept independence for Lithuania and the other two Baltic republics - Latvia and Estonia. His statement was hailed by Lithuania's President Vytautas Landsbergis who told reporters the moment marked \"the beginning of a new period of history\". Mr Landsbergis gave the opening speech at the concert, taking the opportunity to demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lithuania. \"Peace is returning to Lithua- nia and we are opening the gates for peace to come to the world,\" he said. His speech was followed by an eclectic mixture of Lithua- nian folk dances, rock music and the nationalist songs that have been a hallmark of the Lithuanian independence cam- paien. Around the stage the flags of the 34 countries that have so far recognised Baltic indepen-. dence hung in a multi-coloured display. The American flag was Con- spicuous by its absence. But following the telephone conver- sation between President George Bush and Mr Landsber- gis on Saturday night, in which Mr Bush announced he would be making \"a joyous announcement\" within the next few days, most Lithua- nians at the concert seemed confident that US recognition was only days away. \"It's very, very important that America recognises us - it's such a key world power,\" said Mrs Zida Kelmitskaite, one of the concert organisers. \"But it upsets us that it's taken so long, particularly with so many of our Lithua- nian cousins living in Amer- - mapenaence aemons-rauon m vuraiu yesuauy won from a boy during an ica,\" added another organiser, who was wearing a T-shirt showing a pro-independence Joy at the prospect of inde- pendence was tempered by caution within the crowd. A Lithuanian economist insisted that \"It's only when all these Soviet troops actually leave Lithuania that I will believe that we're independent.\" During the weekend, Black Beret troops, believed to have been responsible for more than 20 deaths in Lithuania this year, were reported to be dis- persing. Colonel Vital Frolov, commander of the north Vil- nius army garrison, told a Lith- uanian parliamentary spokes- man that about half the troops had left on Saturday morning by air to an unspecified desti- nation, and that the other half were returning home in Lith- uania. However, the military garri- son, which sports posters glori- fying Lenin and the \"interna- tionalist spirit of the army\", looked as if for the present it was staying put.",

   "text_content" : "By Poear Mardsh THE business world appears to be holding off fom expressing new Interest in investment portunities In the Soviet Union, a result of uncertain- ties about who.lt running the country and the seale of west- er economic assitance. According to consultants and economists working on Soviet business projects, few large commercial ventures are likely to be finalised until detals become cdearer of the division of power between cen- tral government authorities and the 15 republics. Also at issue is the likely size and nature of help by the ladstrial democracies in Q the Soviet economy towards a free market Such assistance could take the form of Injections of cash through loans or credit accords, insurance agreements to underwrite the costs of trade programmes, and advice on how to liberalise the bank- ing system and move to free- market exchange rates. Professor Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachu- setts Institute of Technology and co-author of a recent plan drawn up by US and Soviet economists to reform the Soviet Union, said businesses were \"hanging back\" from dis- cussing specific investment opportunities. He thought that western governments should take a lead in helping the Soviet Union to restructure its econ- omy. This could be done through a radical programme of assistance, aimed probably at the Soviet republics rather than the central government. Observer, Page 12 According to Mr Leonard Geron, an Oxford-based eco- nomic consultant specialising in the Soviet Union, interest by western companies in establishing business ventures will depend on taken by the republics to dis- turbance to trade links between them, should the country's union structure break up. Until such details became settled, companies would be \"in no hurry\" to organise new ventures. The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, whose directors meet tomorrow to discuss the bank's strategy on the Soviet Union, is examining about six detailed proposals by western companies for investment in the USSR, almost all Involving oil and gas projects. The coun- try's large energy reserves have attracted a lot of com- mercial interest, thanks to their usefulness in reducing the industrialised world's dependence for oil and gas on the Middle East. But according to Mr Geoff Pike, of the London-based energy and chemicals consul- 'tancy Chem Systems, even in this potentially lucrative field many companies are unsure about whether to proceed in joint ventures. Mr Charles Movit, an econo- mist at Plan Econ, a Washing- ton-based consultancy which monitors the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, said that in the absence of internal eco- nomic reforms it was still unclear that the country was a good place for Investment. Mr Andreas Gummich, a Soviet specialist at Deutsche Bank It Frankfurt, said that despite the shortterm diffcul- ties there was a big potetial in converting former Soviet arms factories to civilIan pro- duction.

With the elec- tion near, it needs to show it intends to run a more interven- tionist policy towards those state industries faced by immi- nent bankruptcy. On Saturday, Mr Bielecki went to Starachowice, south of Warsaw, to present an interim financial plan to 3,000 workers who have been occupying the town's bankrupt lorry plant since August 8 to protest at its closure. Tbe government's tough line is likely to be combined with an attempt by Mr Bielecki to distance himself from Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister, the offmdal most iden- tified with Poland's anti-infla- tiop programme; which is backed by the International Monetary Fund. The Centre Agreement, a Christian Democratic group modelled on the ruling German CDU, and which has ministers in cabinet and an eye on the voters, is urging Mr Bielecki to drop Mr Balcerowicz outright. President Lech Walesa, who gave his election campaign last autumn an anti-austerity note, has since backed Mr Balcerow- icz and is, for the moment, insisting that he stay.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Bruce in Madrid THE SPANISH government's efforts to devolve power to con- servative nationalist leaders in the Basque region reached a turning point at the weekend when, for the first time in nearly 30 years of Eta's terror- ism, one of its guerrillas was shot dead by Basque police. The killing was done, in Bil- bao late on Friday, by the increasingly confident Basque police force, the Ertzaintza, operating against the separat- ist movement's Vizcaya com- mando. This, one of the last of the organisation's traditional fighting units, was later said to have been shut down. This leaves one itinerant Eta com- mando operating in Spain. Following the arrests of vari- ous exiled Eta leaders in France in the past two years, and the capture or killing of operatives in Spain, Spanish security officials believe Eta to be in serious trouble. The death of one of the Eta members in shooting with the Ertzaintza quickly led to calls from Eta's political arm, the Herri Batasuna party, for the Basque regional government to explain itself. But the govern- ment, run by the conservative nationalist party, PNV, wel- comed the shooting because it showed the regional police were \"maturing\". The Ertzaintza was formed in 1982, but Madrid has been loath to withdraw fully the unpopular Civil Guard from the region, to the detriment of relations with the moderate Basque leaders. Under the Basque autonomy statutes, the Ertzaintza should take over all policing from the national force. The shooting will calm Mad- rid's fears that the Ertzaintza would be soft on Eta. That, in turn, means Madrid might quicken implementation of other elements of the auton- omy statute and thus strengthen nationalist, non-sec- cessionist Basque moderates.",

Among 50 mothers and children at Sun- day lunch is a 10-year-old boy wearing a green beret with the Serbian coat of arms. He says he will stay until his father has won the war for Serbia. \"There will never be peace until Serbia has won,\" says his mother, Mirjana, a Serb from Darda, near the Croatian town of Osyek. She fled what she called \"fascist terror\" last month. Mirjana's house, seven miles south of the Hungarian border, was bombed. The family left all but a few keepsakes behind. Her husband, like most of the men, stayed to fight. She is afraid for him because he is one of the organisers of the armed uprising in Banija, Yugoslavia's leaders were last night expected to sign the peace declaration pro- posed by the European Com- munity to end the violence in Croatia and pave the way for international arbitration. Mr Hans van den Broek, Dutch foreign minister and EC president, yesterday arrived in Belgrade. Hope of a lasting ceasefire yesterday remained slim. Fierce fighting continued around Gospic, a town in central Croatia. The airport in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, yesterday remained closed by federal authorities after a Uganda Airlines jet was seized carry- ing 19 tons of ordnance apparently intended for Croatia's security forces. where the fighting has been especially fierce.

A plaque - Serbian Chil- dren's Refuge, in faded red cyrillic script - bears testa- ment to the civil war of 1941, when hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies were slaughtered by the Ustasha, pro-Nazi Croatian forces. Mother Evgenija says dozens of children whose parents were slaughtered by the Ustasha lived here during the war. A man from Belgrade arrives to donate baby clothes. He says his family fled Croatia during the second world war. \"This is a rebirth of the Ustasha. The west does not understand. Serbia fought with the allies during the war and now Serbia stands punished and alone.\" Today, the children at the convent will start school in a new city. Yet the refugees feel more fortunate than the other 110,000 Serbs and Croats who have fled regions where the undeclared war between Ser- bian militants and Croatian authorities is being waged. Mirjana says the federal army is helping the militants with weapons and protection. \"We will never give up, and soon we will return to our homes.\""

Broadcasters and television manufacturers say both Mr Schwan-Schilling and Mr. Filippo Pandolfl, EC research commissioner, insisted that the directive, which only applies to satellite broadcast- ing, would be introduced and enforced. Broadcasters say the minis- ter warned them they would have to adopt a more construc- tive approach to influence the contents of the directive. German government support is crucial to the success of the directive, which has been crit- icised by most satellite broad- casters and by the UK, Luxem- bourg, Irish and Spanish governments. Opponents of the directive say any attempt to force broadcasters to use D2-Mac would raise costs and limit the growth of the satel- lite TV market. D2-Mac standard is strongly supported by France. Broadcasters and equipment makers say Mr Pandolfi told them the EC would double the proposed subsidy to broadcast- ers who used D2-Mac to Eculbn (Â£690m). Steven Butler adds from Tokyo: Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor company, has joined forces with three leading Japanese electonics companies - Fujitsu, Sony, and Hitachi - to develop inte- grated circuits for the Japa- nese MUSE standard of high- definition television. The agreement is aimed to speed the development of smaller, less expensive elec- tronic gear to decode broad- cast signals, so as to bring down the cost of the product. HDTV sets in Japan now cost about Y4m (Â£17,400).",

   "text_content" : "I H timing of Mr John Major's arrival in Bel- L Jin this morning could hardly be more awkward for the British prime minister. Last night, he was in Moscow, praising the Soviet people for their courage in tearing down the remainin monuments to communism and offering help from the west to build a free market democ- racy. Today, he will meet the leaders who massacred young students in Tiananmen Square two years ago to ensure that as yet Ibn Chinese have been untouched by the triumph of democracy in the west. Mr Major, accompanied by Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, will have to choose his words carefully. The mes- sage from his advisers is that the prime minister will make it clear to his counterparts that he believes China cannot for- ever be immune from the changes sweeping through the rest of the world. Britain's view is that for all China's success so far in com- bining a relatively free market economy with an authoritarian political structure, the pres- sures for democracy cannot be stifled indefinitely. Mr Major will also be carry- ing lengthy dossie crmjinil by Amnesty luteountsulon 'i-o the Foreign Office on t human rights abuses of which the Beijing government has been judged guilty since ths Tiananmen crackdown. Amnesty focuses on 20-or-so specific cases of Ima i onP but provides graphic eOidNa of systematic abuses. The prime minister has promised to raise a number of individual camses. But the very fact of his visit - his is the first by a western leader since the massacre, though it follows that last month of Mr Toshiki Kalfu, the Japanese prime minister - underlines the constraints on his own freedom of speech. His visit to Beijing is the price Britain was ready to pay in order to re-establish workable relations with the Chinese gov- ernment before the transfer of Hong Kong in 1997. More specifically, it was the concession that had to be made if China was to sign a deal acceptable to London and Hong Kong on the construction of a new $16.2bn (Â£9.6bn) Inter- national airport in the colony. The airport, essential to maintain confidence in Hong Kong, could not be built with- do. dl sirtths tht two u'uII dh~is y~ i3.ysari u tag.. havi;i\"~ied .it~I~wlkeÂ·i Ruitam rtllrnbsi ft ~ ~ e-~i~~i Ininthmrak ee ais ON`mpegac movemeuL Ins w dwI They wa~sd`~U~iire ~allwadem Iaolmu vltimath kedrn ~tlvea &e,3&4duvW ME, a imlioi~i r th ftft ribu m~ STme'Dalald wam.is 'ud r em tablk with China over the Ã½ of.. .1 TOat, bac fafjiesre to ruspest out Beintg's approval because the work wll straddle 197.

Major and Premier Li Pang will sign the memorandum of understanding setting out the terms for its construction - including a significant consul- tative role in the prefoject for Beijing prior to 1997 and a promise that Hong Kong will vea minimum of HK$5Sbn in its treasury when it is handed over. From a British standpoint, Mr Major, who files to Hong Kong after his twoday stay in the Chinese capital, cannot afford to jeopardise that agree- met with a strident rhetorical flourish against the authoritar- ianism of his hosts. Mr Hurd, who visited China in the spring, is unrepentant about the stance. His argument is that the UK government does not have the luxury of being able to distance itself from the regime in Beijing. Britain is responsible until 1997 for the future of 6m people in Hong Kong and whether it likes it or not, has to deal with the resent Chinese leadership. The foreign secretary, who refused to sign an earlier deal on the airport which would have OM-3 China waterlr- so *ithe oloy' 41=ir bore the f=rma? transfer, elieves that'an agreement by r M lor to visi BDejing is a -iiua worth paying to protect th interests oi Hong Kong.

Iran and- Iraq have been among its main cus- tomers. There are those in Being, however, who believe that it is China, not Britain, which has got the best of the airport deal. Mr Major's visit will provide the regime with an opportunity to show its own people that China is no longer isolated from the international commu- nity. If Mr Kailu's visit is any guide, Mr Major's handshake will be charted minute-by-min- ute in the state-controlled med*a, alt ough t Britis. rme lnster may lap Qar the leder itl i gthp ,dit t 'sMrev demon itatetat China now has thleiupershand in the con4 tin g. struggle, over the t oursin oenta lztii o a I or u ofeuup t its Kong ser. 11 md the meiormn. dum st a llctive Chli nese v ver the airport and to it. with Britain's insistence that the right to con- sultation does not imply a veto.'. me diplomats in Bei- Jing belIye China is likely to use the agreement over the air- port as a preoedent to demand influence on other issues in Hong Kong prior to 1997.

   "text_content" : "CHINA is actively backing a group of pro-Beling candi- dates for Hong Kong's first direct elections this month, In an apparent effort to under- mine liberal politicians and gain experience of democracy, Angus Foster reports from Hong Kong. Chinese corporations in Hong Koff are providing cam- paign workers for at least four pro-China candidates. The 170,000ootrong pro-Beijing Fed- eration of Trade Unions rec- ommending the candidates to its members. China remains wary of the elections, which will directly elect 18 out of 80 seats for the colony's law-mak- ing council. Mainland newspa- pers have regularly attached the liberals, including Mr Mar- tin Lee, who are expected to win a majority of the 18 seats. China will already be repre- sented in the council because several proChin figures will be indirectly elected by special trade and professional groups. But Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Beijing have decided to support candidates for the direct elections, because they fear a liberal landslide. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, who will be elected to the council unop- posed representing the Federa- tion of Trade Unions, said the federation was supporting three of the same four candi- dates in the direct elections. \"We feel we haven't enough experience of elections so we want to be more involved for the future,\" he stated. The number of directly elected seats will rise to 20 in 1995.",

   "text_content" : "INGAPORE'S 2.7m people entered uncharted terri- tory on Saturday by elect- ing four opposition MPs, creat- ing the largest opposition bloc since the late 1960s. By local standards, the elec- tion was a rebuff to the govern- ing People's Action Party (PAP), even though it took 77, down from 80, of the 81 parlia- mentary seats and 61 per cent of the popular vote. It was also a personal setback for Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, who had campaigned hard to improve the party's 63.2 per cent vote in the 1968 election. Many voters seemed sur- prised by their temerity. \"What have we done? I am afraid we have sent the wrong signal to the prime minister,\" said one of several fearful voters inter- viewed by the state-run televi- sion service. The most telling answer came from Mr Chiam See Tong, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and architect of the opposition breakthrough. \"The voters want to keep the PAP in power, but they also want a strong opposition in parliament to keep an eye on the government. It s a sign that Singapore's democracy is growin up,\" said Mr Chiam. The immediate impact is to end the de facto onearty state which has existed in Singapore for most of the 26 year since the island broke free from Mal- aysia, which it joined in 1963 after independence from Britain. For most of that period, the country was ruled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the strong-minded lawyer who built the PAP and subse- quently eliminated most of the opposition through control of parliament and force of charac- ter. Mr Lee, 67, remains secre- tary general of the PAP, but handed over the prime minis- tership in November to Mr Goh, a 50-year-old career civil servant who has tried to respond to the changing world climate by softening the par- ty's authoritarian image. Mr Goh's more consultative style is popular among voters, most of whom approve of his tentative moves to relax gov- ernment controls by easing censorship and holding neigh- bourhood dialogue sessions. Most observers agree that diversity of opinion has become significantly more acceptable over the past nine months. The government has even permitted the publication of a book of cartoons poking mild fun at PAP leaders. In the immediate aftermath of the election, a visibly angry Mr Goh threatened to put an end to the liberalisation pro- cess, pointing out that he asked the country to endorse his style, and instead lost four seats. Nevertheless, there were indications that Mr Goh may change his mind. The aspect of the results which appeared to worry him most was the 2.2-point fall in the party's share of the popu- lar vote, continuing a steady decline in support from a peak of 77 per cent in 190. But more detailed analysis showed that the PAP vote fell only 0.5 points in those constituencies which were contested in both the 1988 and 1991 elections, suggesting that Mr Goh's style may at least have slowed the rate of decline in PAP support. In addition. the orime minis- Goh: popular style ter knows that a change of tack would risk losing spport within the party, possibly to Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong, the son ofMr Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely thought to share his father's more hard- line views. Mr Goh was notice- ably quick at his post-election press conference to make clear that both the older Mr Lee and his son supported the decision to call an election, and thus share some of the blame for the party's poor showing. In the short term, Mr Goh is more likely to act against oppo- sition candidates from the cen- tre-left Workers party (WP), who were accused during the campaign of provoking conflict between the Chinese majority and Indian and Malay minori- ties. Such a move would com- mand significant support among voters who remember communal rioting in the 1950s and 1960s, even though the allegations are denied by Mr J.B. Jayaretnam, the WP leader. However, the government would have to decide whether to risk prosecutions in open court, or to resort to detention without trial under the Inter- nal Security Act, a repressive measure inherited from British colonial rule. Successful action against the WP candidates could increase the PAP's chances of success in by-elec- tions to be held in 18 months, in which Mr Jayaretnam is expected to stand after a five- year ban from parliament expires. The prime minister con- firmed yesterday that the by- elections would go ahead, not- ing that they would give voters a second chance to endorse his programme. He also admitted that his position could be threatened if they do not. Meanwhile, the big winner is Mr Chiam, a Chinese lawyer, whose SDP took three of the four opposition seats. Mr Goh paid tribute to Mr Chiam's suc- cessful strategy yesterday, and indicated the opposition would be allowed to pla a fu1 role in parliament However, he also warned that the opposition may not have the Impact it expects. \"I may be a little deaf,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "Kuwait's oil minister, Ramoud al-Rouba, inspects the first sample of petrol refined in the Ahmadi Refinery, the country's biggest, since it resumed operations after the Iraqi invasion. Kuwait can now produce and refine oil to meet its domestic needs, he said at the official re-opening ceremony By Hugh Camegy in Jerusalem ISRAELI ministers were confronted yesterday with the hard choices facing them if the economy is to stay on track over the next three years, when the full impact of Soviet Jewish immigration will be felt. Soviet immigration is the main source of fiscal pressure in the draft budget proposals for 1992 and the subsequent two years tabled in cabinet yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, finance minister. The upheaval in the Soviet Union has cast doubt over how many Jews will continue to emigrate to Israel, but 350,000 have already arrived, and 650,000 more are expected by 1995. Most controversial is a big cut in 1992 defence spending, traditionally the biggest non- debt item in the budget, which Mr Moda'i argues must be made if immigration, is to be funded without .blating deft- cits and stolinilation. The governltmb4ii t dsBstetdue^ to continue this week, began just three days before Israel formally requests US govern- ment guarantees covering loans for immigration of $10bn (Â£5.9bn). The guarantees would cut the price of borrowing, and are an integral part of Mr Moda'i's planning. But Israel, already the big- gest recipient of US aid, has received no assurance that the loan guarantees will be forth- coming - at least in the amounts it is seeking. Aside from possible political condi- tions on Israel's attitude to Washington's Middle East peace efforts, the finance min- istry warned the Bush adminis- tration would need to be assured the government's eco- nomic policy was sound before approving guarantees. Mr Moda'i proposes holding the budget deficit next year to 5.5 per cent of GDP, declining to around 1 per cent in 1994. He expects growth to rise from around 6 per cent his year to 8 per cent in 1994. But this will not prevent a widening exter- nal deficit and unemployment moving up from 10 per cent to 14 per cent. Inflation is expec- ted to stay at an annual rate of 21 per cent. With pressure to reduce, not increase, the already weighty tax burden, the draft budget calls for Shk5OOm (Â£127m) to be cut from next year's defence budget. With a further defer- ment of planned defence spend- ing worth ShkS00m, this would bring defence expenditure IbeloW'F ShklS1bM Similar amounts should be lopped off government construction pro- grammes, it says, leaving total government spending targeted at Shk78.8bn. Mr Moda'i says the reduced Arab military threat following the defeat of Iraq means Israel can afford a temporary cut in defence. But Mr Moshe Arens, defence minister, and Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, chief of staff, are mobilising the Israeli defence lobby to back their call for a Shklbn addition to the defence budget, to help Israel develop its own anti-missile satellites.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By David Goodhart MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, has ruled opt raising the party's proposed statutory minimum wage from half of male median earnings to two thirds of earnings in the lifetime of one parliament. In an interview on the eve of the Trades Union Congress, significantly with The Director magazine, Mr Kinnock also estimated that only 7.8 per cent of the British workforce would be affected by the'50 per cent minimum wage raising hourly earnings to a base of Â£3.40. Union estimates have been rather higher, at more than 10 per cent. There has been some ambi- guity about how quickly Labour would raise the mini- mum wage from 50 per cent to the goal of two thirds. Mr Kin- nock now states: \"We will introduce the 50 per cent level promptly, but any advance on that is going to depend entirely on the performance of the economy, so there can't be a timetable. It's likely that any advance will wait some years and be beyond the lifetime of one parliament.\" The minimum wage would not apply to trainees, but 31.5 per cent of those affected would be aged 18 to 20. Distri- bution and retail would be the most affected sector, with about 20 per cent of all employ- ees getting a wage rise. On the revived interest in relations between the Labour party and the trade unions, Mr Kinnock said: \"There isn't a dependent relationship of any kind. People look back and say we are hand-in-glove. Frankly, EMPLOYMENT if that had been the case we wouldn't have had the winter of discontent in \"78-\"79. I think that [is] even more the case now that there's a different structure, a different attitude, in the trade unions.\" He was supported by Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the Labour loyalist Amalgamated Engi- neering Union, who said accep- tance by trade unions that not all Conservative employment law could be repealed repre- sented a \"coming into line\" with Labour. \"That shows you who's calling the shots.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff EMPLOYERS are planning pay deals over the coming year that will outstrip inflation by at least 1 or 2 percentage points, according to a survey of nearly 400 private-sector com- panies due to be published at the end of this week. The overwhelming majority of employers say they intend to settle at significantly lower levels in 1991-92 than they did last year. The Industrial Rela- tions Services pay research group says the median pay deal might fall from its current level of 7 per cent to nearer the 6.5 per cent mark by the autumn of this year. Deals are likely to stabilise and focus on the 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent range in the win- ter, with only a slight uplift likely in the spring as the econ- omy recovers. With inflation projected to fall to between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent in 1992, IRS says it appears that, as during the period of low inflation in the mid 1980s, employers \"hope to provide a substantial cushion for their employees against price rises by setting their pay increases a percentage point or two above the prevailing infla- tion rate\". Inflation-plus settlements would continue the trend established this year. Although settlements fell rapidly in the first half of 1991, most still exceeded the inflation rate. IRS says pay freezes and pauses are most likely in the next few months as some com- panies attempt emergency action on their costs. Overall, fewer than one in 20 employers is planning a freeze. The most likely revamp of pay structures over the coming year will concern individual performance pay. The survey finds, however, that most com- panies do not plan to restruc- ture pay systems radically. Further hours cuts are planned, especially in engineer- ing and associated industries, with working time flexibility also high on the agenda. Pay and Benefits Bulletin Annual survey.

   "text_content" : "O NE OF the favourixt anecdotestold by Mr Norman. llg secretary of the Trades Union .Conre, concer George sor. At theenof a paricu- larly uneventul TUC co week, Woodock reacted wlih glee to a Journalist's accus- tions that the event had been boring. \"Thank you very much\" he said. Last week, at ap press conference, Mr .,llsi echoed Woodcock's sentiments. \"I hope it is not too interesting for you,\" he said. He had just finished a long monologue about how the theme of the week would be social partner- ship. Pressing for meetings between the government, employers and unions is a wor- thy cause, but it is unlikely to stir the public imagination. The sad fact for the TUC is that the public would be much more likely to become aware of this week's congress if it were unable to prevent two other partnerships - that between the unions themselves and that between them and a Labour government - from running into trouble. The unions' need to keep dif- ferences to a minimum is per- haps more pressing than at any time since the Tories took office in 1979. One reason is that they know for certain that this is the last congress before an election. More important is the green paper on employment legisla- tion. The danger of the latest proposals is that they may strike directly at the heart of the unions' finances. That is because they include a measure requiring union members to sign at least once a year a declaration that they want their employer to con- tinue arrangements for deduct- ing union dues from salaries. Unions at present collect 80 per cent of dues through \"check- off\" arrangements. If members had to think every year about whether they wanted to remain in their union, some, perhaps many, would leave. Such considerations have Norman Willis yesterday: hoping that disagreements among unions can be postponed until after a Labour victory concentrated minds on seeking harmony on the two most divi- sive issues among unions - pay and employment law. Unions with widely diverg- ing opinions have agreed to back a single, if unwieldy, motion on pay and collective bargaining. Divisions over employment law proved too great to bridge and two motions - one strongly back- ing the Labour party's policy of partial reform, the other seeking the repeal of all anti- union legislation - will be presented to congress. The phrase \"all anti-union legislation\" means all things to all people. Mr Ron Todd, gen- eral secretary of the TGWU general workers' union, argues that his union's backing of such a policy this summer did nout commit it to a repeal of all post-1979 legislation. Mr Todd withdrew the \"all anti-union\" phrase from the *ro-Labour leadership motion le will propose, in part because he believes the argu- ment over the word \"all\" dis- tracts from more important issues. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mine- workers, does believe in the repeal of legislation requiring ballots and elections of offi- cers. Most other unions do not. However, his motion does not go into many specific details, enabling it to win support from perhaps a quarter of delegates. \"ere Mr Scargill's motion car- ried, it would be a severe set- back for Labour. Even then, however, there would be only limited pressure for it to change its policies, and it would almost certainly not do so. The unions 'will have an influential role in determining Labour's plans for more co- ordination of wage bargaining. Those are still at a relatively early stage. For example, the precise role of a national eco- nomic assessment (NEA), in which government, employers and unions would take part, has still to be determined. In spite of this week's likely unanimous support for the TUC and Labour party's pay bargaining policy, there are differences among unions about how it should work. A fundamental split exists over how far unions should show pay restraint. The motion rejects rigid or imposed pay norms - as does the Labour party. However, Mr Alan Tuf- fin, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers and proposer of the motion, says he would expect the NEA to have a view of what can be afforded on pay. \"If we are going to seek money for training, the health services, pensions, a minimum wage, surely the government is entitled to ask 'What is in it for us'?\" To most union leaders that is pay restraint, anathema to most, but not to all. Mr Willis and other TUC offi- cials no doubt hope that Mr Tuffin is not too explicit about his beliefs on Wednesday, thus postponing the rows until after a Labour victnry.",

   "text_content" : "A SERIES of opinion polls published at the weekend sug- gests that trade unions are less unpopular than for many years, David Goodhart writes. But the polls also show little enthusiasm for abandoning Conservative union laws, They also betray scepticism about the Labour party's union links. An NOP poll for the TUC found that 75 per cent of respondents thought \"unions are necessary to protect peo- ple's interests at work\" while 86 per cent agreed that \"busi- ness works better when man- agement takes notice of work- ers and their trade union representatives\". nions were blamed for Britain's economic ills by only 42 per cent, compared with 76 per cent who blamed poor management. The GMB general union, h a survey of changing attitudes to unions, found that 67 per cent of voters said unions were a \"good thing\" in September 1990, compared with 69 per cent in 1952, the first year the Gallup polling organisation asked the question. The num- ber of voters saying unions were \"a bad thing\" was 21 per cent in 1990, compared with 12 per cent in 1952. The GMB review found that voters proved of Conserva- tive legslation in the early 1980s. most of the provi- sions there was strong support. The electorate now opposes further moves to restrict unions and in 1990 only 30 per, cent of voters said unions were \"too powerful\", compared with 77 per cent in 1979. The fluctuation in the approval rating for unions closely mirrors the numbers of days lost due to industrial dis- putes. In years of heavy indus- trial action, the approval rat- ing tumbled. A more recent Gallup poll found that 70 per cent think unions \"a good thing\", com- pared with only 51 per cent in 1979. Of voters, 25 per cent said the belief that \"Labour is in the pocket of the trade unions\" was a reason for not backing the Labour party.",

   "text_content" : "HE DECISION by Dr David Owen, the last leader of the defunct Social Democratic party, not to contest his Plymouth constitu- ency at the next general elec- tion brings to an apparent end one of Westminster's most intriguing political careers of the past 20 years. Since the demise 15 months ago of the SDP, the party he helped to found in 1981 to Ibreak the mould of British politics, it has seemed increas- ingly ikely that Dr Owen would leave the House of Com- mons at the election. He practi- cally said as much in July last year. Yet the announcement of his decision, in advance of the publication next week of his book Time -to Declare, still commanded Sunday newspaper headlines. In part, the fascination with his political future comes from the glamour that has attached to him since aIM, the year in which he became the youngest foreign secretary since Sir Anthony Eden. His stature grew as the number of former cabinet ministers in opposition ranks dwindled. In the 1980s, as the most charismatic of the Gang of Four who set up the SDP, he reived growingpn , espeialy after bem W SD? liader in 198 He in particular embodied its approach of \"a toagh eonom policy and ten- der social ply'. the party thrived on media coverage and bylections, but failed to con- irt omen ir i opalo- pol ratih kot arge numbers More Dr Owen has aqurd a uima platll role sas hlaseric- w- COW seofe about aW i the las mai parts codM sil oner ea tem the sl at g al the nMaed veoters br wrm t MSDP was the Mia for smnoawn w I athee iba ftm Ua he speaks of Mr Major seems to be reciprocated.

He also expressed the hope that the changes in the party since Mrs Thatcher's departure have not extended to its attitude to the market econ- omy and to trade union reforms. His decisions to leave the Commons came, he says, because he felt his influence was decreasing. \"In as much a SDP has been a influence, I admit my influ- ence is waning. It's better to face up to that and not hang on beyond the due momual On occasions he has smnded as though he beuevs the Ifhl- ence of the SDP was solely responsible for the Labour party's move towards more moderate polcies since the early 1908.

The TUC, which is due to debaite the issue at its confer- ence in Glasgow on Wednes- day, is likely to back proposals both to reject and accept the notion. Some union leaders, in par- ticular r MJohn Edmonds, gen- eral secretary of the GMB gen- eral union, and Mr Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers, have argued that co- ordinated bargaining, after a national economic assessment as proposed by the Labour party, would help to ease infla- tion and increase real earn- ags. Union opponents of the scheme interpret it as a covert move towards pay restraint. The latest detailed propos- als, published today by the Campaign for Work pressure group, suggest the exclusion of the government, as well as public-sector unions and employers, from much of the process of co-ordinating pay. Campaign for Work was involved in controversy this year when it emerged that the group had been invited to present the case for co-ordinat- ing pay to the prime minister's think tank headed by Mrs Sarah Hogg. Mr Michael Howard, employ- ment secretary, has main- tained the opposition shown to the concept by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister. It is understood that the Department of Employ- ment was not consulted before the pressure group was invited to give evidence to the think tank. The Invitation was sub- sequently withdrawn. Professor Alan Budd, who takes over this month as chief economic adviser to the Trea- sury, has shown sympathy for the group's ideas. -The National Economic Assessment and the Role of Co- ordinated Pay Bargaining.

   "text_content" : "By Tim Lawrmne NEW TELEPHONE charges introduced today by BT (for- merly British Telecom) and Mercury Communications seem more likely to baffle than enlighten business users. After the week or more dur- ing which companies have had the opportunity to study the new scales, many have found it far from easy to work out which service will be cheaper. Mr Peter Allen, chairman of the Telecommunications Users' Association, said: \"One cannot complain that there is more choice available, but it will be difficult for companies to take advantage of this because BT and Mercury are using differ- ent pricing mechanisms. \"While there will probably be some benefits for large busi- ness organisations, smaller companies may find it difficult to work through what is a very complex set of arrangements.\" Mr Derek Nicholas, senior telecommunications analyst at Citibank and chairman of the computing, telecommunica- tions and information policy committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, believes neither company has a clear-cut advantage, and that the new price changes only complicat6 the situation still further. He said: \"In some cases BT offers the best routes, in others Mercury's are the best on offer. The blend will depend on traf- sic volumes; the routes over which that traffic is going and the prices of those routes at different times of the day.\" BT announced at the begin- ning of August that it would increase prices overall by about 7 per cent less than the rate of inflation, with dis- counts for high-volume cus- tomers, but would introduce higher line rental and connec- tion charges. The changes were described at their launch in August as \"a mixed pudding\" by Mr Mike Bett, BT's vice-chairman. On August 21, Mercury announced a similarly radical restructuring of its prices. The price of calls is to fall, by more for big businesses than for small business and residential customers, and a new \"fre- quent caller\" programme comes in to compete with BT's discount system. As both telecommunications companies fought for business, Mercury won the contract for London Transport's telephone network from BT last week. Mercury said: \"This agree, ment means that more compa. nies are starting to recognie we have a genuine competitive edge over ST.\" Before the changes, BT was losing customers, especially businesses, in a slow trickle to Mercury. The changes are not expected to change te compa- nies' relative competitive posi- tions. Citibank, which uses both networks, will reappraise how it uses them in the light if the new charges, according to Mr Nicholas. \"Pressures to cut costs because of the general economic situation means that the new price offers will be given serious attention,\" he said. Today's changes will affect businesses in two ways. First, operating costs for telephone traffic will continue to fall because most big companies make a substantial number of international calls, which will now be significantly cheaper. Second, as prices fall, special-purpose networks, which were introduced by many big businesses on the expectation that they would reduce telephone costs, will Because the eew pricng sys- tiearni coisiiope. only, are businesses wilth sopisticted telephone' switching systems, which automatically, lect th chas'pest, route, wfl be I able to benefit fully from the price''. war. . M sit large businesses will. probably continue to use a mixtigre of BT and Mercury services, with BT used predom- inantly for incoming calls and MerrW mused mostly for outgo. ing calls. -The fact that both networks are available pro- vides companies with' a mea- sure of security should one sys- tem break down. Companies are likely to wait for the situation to become more clear before making any radical change in their alle- glances. Mr Ron Bell, head of group telecommunications at BP, pre- fers to stand back from the price battle in the telephone market. He said: \"It isn't our policy to switch backwards and for- wards at short notice every time BT or Mercury introduce a price change. We are not expecting to make any rapid changes.\" Mike Bett: BT pricing changes are \"a mixed pudding\"",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Skapinker PROGRAMMES broadcast by British Sky Broadcasting were disrupted for nearly three hours yesterday, apparently because one of the two Astra satellites had begun to tumble. BSkyB, in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times holds a stake, said it appeared that Astra 1B, the second Astra satellite, had remained in the 70 square-mile area in space that it was meant to occupy but appeared to be rolling around. BSkyB said broadcasts of the Movie Chan- nel and Sky Sports had been disrupted from 4.44 pm yester- day. Last night, BSkyB said broadcasts had returned to normal. Astra 1B experienced similar gyrations last June, the month the satellite was launched, but those only lasted for 20 min- utes. The satellite was put into orbit by the European rocket Ariane IV after two earlier attempts had been abandoned because of technical difficul- ties. BSkyB said last night it had been unable to contact the owners of the satellite.",

The survey of the legal departments of more than 100 top companies carried out by Chambers & Partners, the legal recruitment consultancy, shows that, on average, outside fees are 329 times as high for senior lawyers and 3.0 times as high for junior lawyers. Among the top commercial law firms in Lomndm, the high- est rates are about five times as high as a company's own coats.

   "text_content" : "By Paul Chesright, Midlands Correspondent FOUR chambers of commerce in the Black Country area of the west Midlands are organising a joint lobby of the Conservative and Labour party conferences this month and next. The chambers of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton are to present conference delegates with a plea for cash aid to replace worn-out industry and to improve the local environment. They will also seek political support for new road links. One of the most industrialised areas in the UK, the Black Country has suffered severely in the recession. Unemployment rates, depending on the borough, are between 3 and 4.5 percentage points above the national average. The decision to lobby the party conferences reflects the desire to overcome the view in the Black Country that, as Mrs Anne Avian, manager of the Sandwell chamber, put it: \"We are always left out of things.\" It also reflects the trend among chambers of commerce nationally to pool resources to provide a better service to business. In October 1990, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the umbrella body for the individual chambers, introduced a plan to promote co-operation among chambers. That envisaged 55 \"core\" chambers, as smaller chambers affiliate with the larger ones. The catalyst for a combined effort at the party conferences by the normally independent Black Country chambers is believed locally to be the efforts of Mr Don Richardson and Mr Roy Richardson, the brothers who own Richardson Developments, the property group.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Cassell, Business Correspondent THERE is now widespread, if moderate, optimism throughout British industry that 1992 will bring an upturn in business to all sectors of the economy, according to a survey conducted jointly by the Confederation of British Industry and A.T. Kearney, management consultants. The survey, published today, finds that most companies across 18 business sectors expect sales and profits to recover next year from 1991 levels. Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI economic affairs director, said: \"It looks like 1992 will be the year of recovery for the British economy.\" The survey - of 685 private-sector companies with combined annual sales of Â£65bn and 1.5m employees - confirms that the recession will nevertheless continue to take its toll, with capital spending and employment levels falling well into 1992. Nevertheless, it reports that employers remain committed to increased training and that spending on research and development is likely to continue to hold up well. The findings, based on questions asked in May and early June, are among the most optimistic conclusions yet to be drawn about the medium-term economic outlook. In spite of growing evidence that the recession has already bottomed out, though, the survey's authors confine themselves to suggesting only that the low point of the present cycle will be reached before the end of 1991. The survey concludes that the improvement in sales is expected to be in advance of profitability in returning to 1989 levels. Profits will continue to be squeezed by rising costs and an inability to raise prices. Every industry sector is predicting higher sales next year, with nearly half the participants expecting them to return to 1989 levels before the end of this year. Yet even the most optimistic sectors - motor vehicles, communications and financial services - are predicting recovery rather than real expansion. The survey concludes that the recession is, in spite of its difficulties, forcing changes that should be of longer-term benefit to British business. The main reaction of management to what it describes as a \"historically severe decline\" in domestic demand has been to emphasise cost reduction and to improve quality. The survey shows that companies are planning to improve the quality of personnel from within their organisations, placing greater emphasis on training, job switching and retraining. Businesses of all sizes are said to be taking the same view. On unemployment, the survey finds that most small companies expect to recruit more people in 1992, while large and medium-sized businesses say they will continue to shed labour. The most significant impact of continuing job losses will be on unskilled manual staff, management and administration. Managing the Year Ahead - Business Responses to Current Economic Pressures.

   "text_content" : "David Laelles, Banking Editor 'iOP international banking Irpervisors gather in Stock- 1 omi today for a two-day meet- ing- at which the shutdown of oBank of Credit and Commerce International will dominate the The meeting of the so-called ,Basle Committee of banking officials from the Group of Ten industrial countries is the first since BCCI's assets were seized in a worldwide swoop on July 5. The meeting will also be the first to be chaired by Mr Ger- ald Corrigan, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, who was appointed only three days after BCCI was closed. Although officials do not expect the meeting to produce immediate changes in banking regulation, it will provide them with their first opportunity to discuss the failings exposed by the BCCI crisis. The officials are expected to consider ways of tightening up the Basle Concordat, which allocates responsibility for supervising banks with operations in more than one country. They may insist, for example, that banks incorpo- rate in the country where they have their main business, and that they all have a clearly defined lender of last resort. The BCCI affair may also lead to changes in supervisory and auditing practices to enable fraud to be identified more quickly. Mr Corrigan has avoided making any specific state- ments about the lessons of BCCI since his appointment, other than emphasising the THE BCCI SHUTDOWN need to avoid jumping to con- clusions over a bank that was unique in many respects. He will be testifying to a congres- sional banking committee about BCCI on September 13. The BCCI affair will also be discussed by G10 central bank governors when they hold their first post-holiday meeting in Basle in a week's time. * Mr Masihur Rahman, who was BCCI's chief financial offi- cer until he resigned last year, accused the Bank of England and Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, of \"gross negligence\" in their handling of the bank. In an interview with the Observer yesterday, Mr Rah- man said both the Bank and Price Waterhouse failed to act even though there was evi- dence of irregular lending in 1989, and of possible fraud in BCCI's treasury in 1985. The Bank of England was interested only in \"a white- wash\" until the evidence of fraud was so overwhelming that it had no choice but to shut the bank, he said.

   "text_content" : "Â·'. 1' Â·Â·lf;Â·:Â·Â·.IÂ·Â·;(i:Â·Â·:;t~::::Â·;:i::'.Â·;:l ~n~donwrrhm cholo~ I r~ it t she irra IDelta nance hangar, a under inapectio It is a certing creature -freshly- painted so that its coroate' logos have been obliterated, yet minus any new ones. \"The ultimate generic aircraft,\" chuckles one employee. This situation was not to last long. Until mid-August, the plane belonged to Pan Am. ser- vicing its Boston-New York- Washington shuttle routes. Now, both the routes and some aircraft are being bought by Delta, one part of a much larger deal hammered out with the bankrupt seller's creditors on August 12. Delta wanted to start erat- ing the shuttle by September 1. So, in less than three weeks, jets had to be overhauled and painted, ticketing arrange- ments and advertising changed, and additiona employees recruited. All, more- over, without disrupting cur- rent operations. This is how the world's larg- est airline is being created - and the winds of change can be felt throughout the Atlanta headquarters. Walk through Delta's maintenance facilities, for example, and new hangars are being added. A 152,000 sq ft reservations centre is going up and there are already plans to extend its training centre, only three years old. Pilots, meanwhile, are being recruited at a rate of 90 a month, while more than one new aircraft is being added every week. Spurring this growth is the drive by Delta, currently num- ber three in the industry, to switch from being a predomi- nantly domestic airline to one with a global network - a transformation which the Pan Am deal helps hugely. It is doing so under intense rivalry from other big US carri- ers, like American Airlines and United, and the rationale in all cases is the same. Domestic traffic growth has been negligi- ble since the late-1980s, while international traffic continues to expand at double-digit rates. But managing such change is no simple task and, for Delta in particular, one question looms large. How will a highly- prized corporate culture sur- vive as the airline leaps to the forefront of its industry? It would be hard to under- state Delta's uniqueness, much of which centres on the famed \"family\" relationship between the company and its 67,000 employees. Delta personnel are among the best paid in the industry and yet, pilots aside, they are not unionised. The 65-year-old company prides itself on promotion from within, a policy which extends to the highest management ranks. (Ron Allen, its chair- man, started out in the person- nel department.) There is also a \"no redundancy\" pledge, which is remarkable given the industry's fickle fortunes. The upshot is minimal staff turnover; flight crews have even included a few great- grandmothers. The airline, moreover, can take its pick when recruiting newcomers, with the result that over 90 per cent of its pilots arrive with previous military training. At times, to an outsider, the philosophy seems slightly over- whelming - beards, for exam- ple, are outlawed throughout the group - but there is no doubting employees' response. When the airline hit a rough patch in 1982, they chipped in to buy Delta a new Boeing. And it would be wrong, in a \"people business\" where cus- tomer service is a major sales point, to view these guiding principles as pure altruism. For all its southern, conser- vative image, the airline has operated fairly astutely. Three major acquisitions - Chicago and Southern, Northeast Air- lines and then Western - have given it a comprehensive domestic network, with well- placed hubs at Atlanta, Cincin- nati, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Orlando. At the end of 1990, Delta bad one of the youngest fleets in the industry and, in recent years, it has been by far the strongest carrier financially. Between 1986 and 1990, Salo- mon Brothers calculates that cash flow averaged 71 per cent of total debt, compared with 33 per cent for United and 27 per cent for American. The Pan Am deal, however, opens up a different ballgame. Essentially, there are three parts to the transaction - the purchase of the shuttle operations; of Pan Am's remaining European assets, which include a Frankfurt hub; and about 45 per cent of a much-reduced Pan Am opera- tion (with the airline's credi- tors owning the remainder.) Immediate logistics aside, the shuttle element is rela- tively straightforward. For a start, one major rival - the Trump Shuttle, which flies identical routes - is undergo- ing some upheaval. Donald Trump's bankers are repossess- ing the carrier and handing its management to Northwest Air- lines, but no dates or details for this transfer have been fin- alised. Secondly, some studies by Delta have also suggested that passengers liked the way Pan Am had run the service. \"The common thread was: don't change anything - it works,\" says Al Kolakowski, Delta's vice-president of mar- keting. \"Basically well mirror what Pan Am has been doing, only put a Delta brand on it.\" The European assets are another matter. From an oper- ational viewpoint, most ana- lysts are enthusiastic. The routes will significantly enlarge Delta's international network which, in 1990, pro- duced only $lbn out of its $8.5bn revenues. Pan Am flies to around 40 Transatlantic des- tinations, including a number in Asia, and also possesses a \"significant\" number of the rights to fly certain routes which it is not currently using. Moreover, an expanded presence at Kennedy airport will be extremely beneficial. As Ron Allen points out: \"We'd seen more and more of the need for a gateway out of the North-East - and New York was obviously the best.\" On the other hand, analysts gener- ally agree that Delta's vastly superior domestic network will mean that it can feed the Euro- pean routes more efficiently, transforming their profitabil- ity. \"The question is mass,\" comments Paul Turk, analyst with the Avmark aviation con- sultancy, \"and they have achieved that\" But, in management terms, there are potential hurdles. For a start, Delta will also take on 6,600 Pan Am employees, who come from a different culture - far more internationally- minded, and unionised. The buyer has the advantage that its own pay rates are higher - an average 22 per cent differential for US staff, according to Maurice Worth, vice-president of personnel - and there will be a three-year period during which ex-Pan Am employees climb up to Delta scale. Delta's own excellent labour relations, moreover, seem to have stood the carrier in good stead so far. \"It's like day and night,\" comments the Pan Am flight attendants' union, com- paring its experience in the Delta deal with the complica- tions which followed United's purchase of Pan Am's Heath- row routes earlier this year. But even Delta acknowl- edges that extending its \"fam- ily\" philosophy to employees in non-US bases may be tricky. One solution is to form \"spirit teams\", made up of Delta vol- unteers, who would visit major European locations and simply chat, without management supervision. The scheme, it claims, reaped dividends in the merger with Western. The airline concedes, too, that - since it is not buying Pan Am's 747s - it will be constrained initially by aircraft capacity. A realignment of Delta's entire European net- work is still being planned, with a view to a possible November 1 start date. But, at this moment, Kolakowski pre- dicts that Delta may actually back out of some Pan Am mar- kets, although frequencies may be increased in others. Meanwhile, on the market- ing front, there is the simple problem of \"brand identity\". \"When we start getting into Ankara or Bombay, our name is not exactly a household word,\" says Kolakowski can- didly. \"So I think the launch ads are trying to find a way to link Pan Am with Delta, and capitalise on both.\" But perhaps the element in the Pan Am deal that worries analysts most is the stake which Delta will take in the \"reorganised\" Pan Am, the much-reduced operation run- ning the Latin American/Carib- bean routes from a Miami hub. For example, Standard & Poors, the rating agency, has suggested that the European benefits may be \"more than offset by the scale of assumed liabilities and the investment in a still struggling Pan Am\". The concerns are twofold: Delta's financial exposure and the amount of time and effort which may be diverted to a potentially troublesome invest- ment. From a financial view- point, the Pan Am deal was complicated; Delta's cash out- lay was (Ulm - $416m for the Europeanflhuttle assets and I3nam for shares and notes In Pan Am. But it also agreed to assume various liabilities. Tom Roeck, Delta's finance director, claims that the real cost of the transaction, in terms of additional Pan Am lia- bilities, is (56m - a figure he derives from a fairly persua- sive set of additions and sub- tractions, but which varies sig- nificantly from the numbers given In the bankruptcy court. (For example, Delta has prom. ised to assume up to $100m- worth of Pan Am ticket liabili- ties, but Roeck suggests that the actual cost of this may be nearer $40m.) The net result, he argues, will be to increase Delta's debt- to-equity ratio of around 45a55 at end-June, to a pro forma 52:48. In airline industry terms, that is eminently respectable. But some analysts worry that the expenditure will not stop there. On the plus side, Pan Am's Latin American routes are traditionally profit- able, and projections given to creditors have suggested an $83m profit by 1995; the com- pany has some $300m-worth of tax losses to carry forward; and Roeck claims that the busi- ness will be fairly well-capital- ised with a 50:50 debt-to-equity ratio (excluding capital leases) by year two. On the minus side, Ameri- can, a big rival, has already stepped up the competition by announcing a 27 per cent increase in its own flight capacity in the region. And Kolakowski acknowledges that Delta will input into matters like ground handling, advertis- ing, contract services and so on - despite Pan Am's sepa- rate management. \"Delta's going to have a major stake in this company, so it's going to do whatever it takes to support it,\" he comments. But, at the end of the day, perhaps the hardest question is whether success itself could bring problems. Could interna- tional size dull some of Delta's individuality? Might consolida- tion in the industry create flack from customers if rock-bottom fares disappear? In the throes of far more immediate concerns, Allen con- cedes the possibility. \"We have to be sensitive to that,\" he says simply. \"When customers have choice I want them to pick Delta - but that doesn't mean we're always perfect.\" And, as it battles for Euro- pean customers in competition with brasher rivals, such engaging modesty may yet be Delta's strongest suit.",

   "text_content" : "THE WORLD MAY BE IN A RECESSION BUT NOBODY TOLD THAILAND. While most of the world wrestles with recession, Thailand's economy is booming. It is enjoying a period of unparalleled prosperity, with one of the fastest growing economies in the world. This boom period is being export-led and investment driven, attracting leading foreign investors. In particular it appeals to those looking to relocate their production bases in preference to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Incentives like tax-free periods make investing in Thailand an enormously attractive proposition. Tourists, too, are being attracted in ever increasing numbers, contributing a total of US$3,855m to the economy in 1989. Thailand is exceptional in the diversity of interests it offers tourists, and so is unlikely to fall out of fashion after several years, as usually happens with destinations enjoying such popularity. Thailand's growth is mirrored by that of its airline, Thai Air- ways International. In 1989 it was the fastest growing airline in the world, and it continues to grow rapidly. This success has prompted Thai Airways International to seek privatisation through listing on the stock market later this year, and it is predicted it will be one of Thailand's most sought after stocks. As a sign of endorsement of Thailand's continuing importance, The World Bank has chosen to hold its annual international con- ference in Bangkok in October. As you can see, Thailand's economic prospects look extre- mely attractive. 4 No wonder it's known as the Land of Smiles. maunwsmIIICI",

   "text_content" : "By Sihon Holberlon DEATH AND taxes were said to be the only two certainties In life. To that truism can now be added a third: change. Change is the leitmotif of just about everything being written nowadays for manag- ers about management. The sensation of change is daily reinforced with developments as far-reaching as the Gulf War and the collapse of com- munism in the Soviet union. As J B M Kassarlan, a visit- ing professor at the IMD busi- ness school, points out, the critical issue for companies today is how to develop man- agers capable of responding to rapid changes in the business environment - an environ- ment characterised by shorten- ing product life cycles and development times, changing market structures and chang- ing patterns of distribution. To cope with these develop- ments Kassarjian says com- panies need to create leader- managers: executives capable of mastering the unfamiliar and leading change from within. He pooh-poohs some current fads. Rejecting hierar- chical controls for participa- tive management is insuffi- cient; calls for entrepreneurial initiative denies the need for organisational coherence; and, empowerment is just a fad because real self-confidence follows achievement. Managers can acquire the art of leading change. Compa- nies ought to delve within their organisations for manag- ers capable of learning. Kas- sarjian suggests two ways. First, scout for talent. Com- panies ought to be sensitive to those junior executives who show initiative and good judg- ment. The hard part is getting existing senior managers to share information. The chief executive should encourage the sharing of short-lists. The other way is learning through provocation. Learning starts by living through novel and demanding situations. Challenge is always unsett- ling; stretching requires effort; integration begins with a deep sense of achievement and \"continues to resonate in future challenges.\" Jolt your managers out of their comfortable groove - they may learn to lead change.

His Innovations are few, and significant only in the sec- ond act, where he commences the action by showing Giselle's urial by night, and at the very last reinstates the original (Paris, 1841) ending by bring- ing on Bathilde and Wilfrid to lead Albrecht back to the real world. That Albrecht then remains kneeling in prayer in the forest seems unnecessarily ambiguous: unlike James in La Syiphide, this High Romantic hero escapes dangerous fan- tasy to return to life. The staging is elsewhere responsive to tradition. If it has a tendency to fuss - every character in the village is named, which seems an excess of dramatic zeal - the compen- sations come with the lively integration of the dncers Into the narrative.

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALBERT HALL, RADIO 3 The BBC Symphony Orchestra's Prom on Friday, conducted by Peter EUtv6s, ended with one of the master- pieces of contemporary orches- tral music, Birtwistle's Earth Dances, in a performance that was recorded by Collins Clas- sics for future release on com- pact disc. But the evening began with the premiere of a BBC commission: Peter Panu Nash's symphony is the 41- year-old 'composer's most ambitious score to date, a densely argued two-part struc- ture that operates on multtple musical and programmatic layers. Nash describes his sym- phony as a musical narration of a pre-existing story; though he has not disclosed the spe- cifle details, he has admitted it concerns a poet, an impresario ad a idestructive woman who \"&ix6e. between themE Thike have been many operasi writ- ten on flimsier plots, and Nash packs all the emotions and drama of his scenario into a hare 25-minates. The two parts are overlaid with a four-move- ment symphonic plan, with the first movemnt endingin token scherzo, and the highly wrought slow movement flow- ing into the finale, which reaches a catastrophic climax in the final bars. If it all sounds just a little cluttered, the working-out of Nash's scheme does sometimes try to cram in too much. There ure some arresting images: piled up brau and string tre- molandl which u t Sibel- is lurkiging the agnd (and perhaps by extension symphonic Maxwell Davies too), angular woodwind fgura- tion alongside kernels of romantic melody, all reinforc- ing the pluralism of Nash's tyle. Only in the last section, the music gets down to the emotional nitty-gritty, does it gain the directness the symphony seems to be seek- ing, and which the preceding music just manages to blur. * Thursday's Prom given by the Philharmonia under Vladimir Ashkenazy was remarkable for two things: a performance of Tippets Concerto for Double String Orchestra that was so leadeanfooted, so comprehen- sively wide of the mark in con- veying te pirit of Tipptt'S rhythms that one 'wondered what had led Ashkenazy to contemplate it in the first ce, and the dashing Proms ebt of the young American violinist Kurt Nikkanen. He compelled attention In Gla- zunov's concerto fraom the very opening bars, tempering its sweet-toothed lyricism with musical intelligence and force ulness. On this evidence there is certainly much more to Nik- kaen than gorgeous tone and a superlative technique. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "~The story of Spital- fields is a long run- ning saga, but one that looks as though it is at last nearing resolution. Now that the fruit and vegeta- ble market has moved to Tem- pie Mills in Waltham Forest, there can be no doubt about the need to begin the careful transformation of this part of the City of London's eastern fringes. The site that is to be redeveloped is some 12% acres, lying mostly within Tower Hamlets, but with valuable frontage at its western end on Bishopsgate. This part of the scheme almost faces the east- ern edge of the giant Broadgate development. The Broadgate buildings in Bishopsgate are giants in every way. Designed by architects Skidmore Owings and Merrill, they have an extraordinary scale and dominance. At street level they are well finished and detailed. They look almost as though they were on some glossy stretch of Michigan Ave- nue in Chicago. Stylistically, they pose something of a prob- lem. They resemble nothing as much as Ceausescu's palace in Bucharest. They will be the closest neighbours and com- mercial rivals in Bishopsgate to whatever rises on that edge of the Spitalflelds development. It has to be hoped that they will not dictate the scale of the entire neighbourhood. The 12% acres that are poised to be redeveloped con- sist mainly of old market build- ings. There are, however, some important listed buildings. Just outside the area, but dominat- lag it from the East, is Christ Church, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1714. This is one of the great ecclesiastical buildings of Britain and its res- toration is taking an unbeliev- ably long time. The spire, tower and portico form one of the most remarkably sculp- tural achievements of the English Baroque. Seen from the market, it looks like a piece of stage scenery; walk round it and it becomes a fluid and moving piece of monumental sculpture. If this church was in any other European city it would have been totally restored by now. It was given a new roof in 1965 and an histori- cally accrate restoration that is painstaking to the point of agony has been creeping along ever since. The Horner Buildings, around the eastern edge of the market, are listed. They are unremarkable but pleasing examples of 1880s Arts and Crafts style by the little known architect George Sherrin. They have a sociological interest, since Mr Hornmer, who devel oped them, started life as a market porter and then wisely turned to roperty develop- ment. Listed buildings occupy the fringes of the surrounding Conservation Areas, and there are four such areas adjolning the site. The 18th century streets that make up the Four nier Street and Elder Street conservation areas are well known for their houses with silk weaving lofts on their top loors, built by industrious Huguenot refugees. Several have remarkable panelled inte- riors, and mny have been arefulDy restored. Anyone interested in the ftture of British inner cities should take a walk along Brick Lane in Spitaflelds. It is the land of Bangladeshi workshops and traders, the veetable -mosa, the wel-uaed moeque and the most overcrowded 11 11 M * housing in London. Spitalfields has been home to successive waves of immigrants - Hugue. nots, Jews, Asians. The 18th century church on the corner of Fournier Street and Brick Lane has been a synagogue and is now a mosque. It is the crowded poverty of the area that should be noticed, and if you look just yards beyond Brick Lane you cannot fail to notice some of the worst public housing estates in the East End. And yet, you may well ask, what is the rich City, with virtually no residential popula- tion, doing about its neigh- bour? The answer is predictable. The developers SDG (Spital- fields Development Group) acquired the market lands for ossie development with some, but not a lot of, residential, shopping and public uses. SDG is a partnership of BICC plc, county and District Properties Limited, and the London and Edinburgh Trust. Their recently published master plan is the third attempt to get things moving. They already have planning consents for a scheme designed by Fitzroy Robinson Partnership and Mac- Cormac Jamieson and Prichard Architects, which was approved in 1987 when markets for ofces were more buoyant. The developers changed that scheme for one designed with an astonishing level of insensi- tivity by the American archi- tects Swanke Hayden Connel This scheme was called in by the then secretary of state, Mr Chris Patten, and a public inquiry was to have begun in October. After taking a lot of advice, the development team has come up with a new master plan, devised by Ben Thomp- son and Associates from Bos- ton, US. This is the firm that successfully adapted Boston's Faneuil Hall and Quincy Mar- ket. I have just been reading their full report. Apart from being written in an unknown language (it is hard to believe that the authors ever learned English), it is full of sketches that show a world of perma- nent sunshine and cafe Ilfe, to date unknown in Spitalfields. But there is a modesty about the plans that is heartening. Most encouraging is the choice of architects. So far, Sir Nor- man Foster has been chosen to design the key office building in Bishopsgate. Three other good firms - Allies and Morri- son, Edward Cullinan Archi- tects, and Jeremy Dixon Edward Jones, BDP - have been selected for commercial buildings. There is a firm of co-ordinating architects, EPR, which will not have any major design input. There is a danger that only Sir Norman's tower will be built and the good intentions for the whole 12 acres will not be seen as viable. If planning has any credible role left it must be to see that Spitalfields is harmoniously developed for the benefit of its whole popula- tion. The City has a sad and selfish record when it comes to its recent attitude to Dock- lands and the East of London. If it had seen fit to collaborate with growth to the east, instead of cramming as much into the Square Mile as possi- ble, we wouldn't have the iso- lated failure of Docklands or so much overdevelopment. Can Spitalfelds help to restore the balanced development of a civi- lUsed city? Colia Amery",

   "text_content" : "I am glad to report that Wafrdand the arts were in th forefront of the changes rocking the Soviet Union in recent ay. Last Tuesday saw pinnlght at the Palace tre Dostoevsky's The Â¶ljpre0ated by the Noavo- rrledre :. company. For the firt time in the West, and a sgnificant pointer to the futue, the production was sponsored by a Russian com- SKvant Television, which mts television and satellite equipment in Novgorod. ;Alezander Tsvetkov, Kvant's general director, hopes to export his goods and regards the, .theatricalc as an exllmnt way of man busi- As*s contacts in the UK, worth the Â£15,000 cost of the exercise. In sad contrast, because of the ecession, the Palace failed in its attempts to get matching 'spport from British compa- nies. In the current economic cli- mate it is diicult to get busi- ness to cough up Â£100,000 to sponsor a new opera produc- tion. Diffcult but not impossi- ble. The English National Opera set itself a sponsorship target of Â£1.6m for its 1991-92 season, which started last month, just a marginal Â£100,000 more than the Â£.l5m it raised in 1990W91. Before the playing of the first overture, it had already brought in Â£1.35m. Some of this is a solid Â£100,000 or so in contributions from loyal corporate backers such as the TSB and the Wool- wich, plus that increasingly keen sponsor, Guinness. But ENO has learned to adapt to changing conditions and is milking new sources of spon- sorship money. One which is proving resilient is private sponsorship: Mrs Sue Hammer- son, of the family of develop- ers, has given around Â£50,000 to help out Don Giovanni, while an anonymous benefac- tor is underwriting Billy Budd. Another way into the heart, and wallet, of private sponsors is through the ENO patrons scheme. Rich opera lovers have been carefully courted, and within a month of the launch of the scheme 15 had gone all the way, with Â£1,000 contribu- tions which earn the full glory of Patron. Lesser sums bring lesser prestige. The wealthy supporters of the ENO are also being approached via an avenue that the opera company has long avoided - the grand gala even- ing. It hardly matched its voice-of-the-people image, but the chance of securing Â£100,000 from a gala performance of Die Fledermaus, in co-operation with the Royal Academy, past masters of gala events, was irresistible. Just to prove it has not lost the common touch, perhaps the ENO's greatest triumph of 1990-91 was its Sponsor an Opera appeal, through which it asked its audience collectively to sponsor Lady Macbeth of Mtensk. The aim was to raise Â£50,000 to cover some of the costs of this difficult opera. In the event, more than 1,250 small-time sponsors contrib- uted almost Â£100,000 to achieve a poor man's gala. The exercise will be repeated in 1992-9M. A constant complaint of spon- sors is that they rarely receive credit for their support in media coverage of the event. If the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts can be beieved, this has changed rap- idly in the past year. In 1980, ABSA embarked on a campaign to persuade edi- tor, arts editors, critics and reporters on national newspa- pers to mention the sponsor, pointing out that often toe con- cert or ballet would not have taken place without their con. tribution. The lobbying seems to have worked. A survey last December suggested that the name of the sponsor was mentioned in 34 per cent of the sponsored arts events that were reviewed. By March, the coverage had increased to 44 per cent, and by June, 71 per cent of reviewed sponsored events contained a plug. The research may be rough and ready, and during the same months the number of sponsored arts events reviewed showed a steady decline, but at least one corpo- rate excuse for not helping the arts has been removed. * \"Corporate philanthropy is a phenomenon largely confined to the United States,\" begins The Corporate Pahtn, a splen- didly ilustrated volume pub- lished to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. How true this is! The book goes on to praise more than 300 companies that have supported the gallery, starting with Life Magazine and Abbott Laboratories which, within months of its opening, were sponsoring exhi- bitions relating to the war, and going through to 1991, when the Gallery used its celebra- tions to attract a fabulous flow of gifts from private patrons and corporations. In recent years, non-Ameri- can companies have taken advantage of the prestige which flows from linking with this business-friendly museum. The next, very expensive, exhi- bition, \"Circa 1492 - Art in the Age of Exploration\", which opens on October 12, is sup- ported by Japanese companies Nomura Securities and Canon, among others. Profound changes are needed in the tax laws before a British art insti- tution could produce such a comprehensive celebration of corporate generosity. Companies are woefully uni- maginative about employing contemporary artists in the furnishing of their properties. They cou learn from Boosey & Hawkes, the music pub- lisher, which has commis- sioned ten postgraduate sti- dents from the five leadink London art colleges to come up with proposals to decorate six niches in its London show- room. A fire destroyed the 1930s shop last year, but it has been restored to its period glory, except for the paintings. One artist will be chosen and his, or her, career advanced with a Â£9,000 fee for the work. * This is the worrying time for arts companies, as sponsors draw up their marketing plans for next year. The decision of Digital to stay with sponsor- ship is encouraging. The computer company has invested Â£3Sm in the arts over the past five years, most of it in dance, and has decided to renew its support for the next three years. The focus will remain on dance, but the com- pany will also renew its sup- port for the National Theatre. In the past this has been in kind - installing a computer- ised box office - but in 1992 it winl start funding an annual roduction, with Shaw's Antony Thoracroft",

   "text_content" : "HISTORY IS dead; long live history. The central historical theme of the 20th century has been the conflict between lib- eral capitalism and two ugly sisters. One, Nazism, was evil through and through, but by its nature could only appeal to one people. Bolshevism, by contrast, wrapped its amoral fist in a millenarian, interna- tionalist glove. Its appeal being broader, the threat it presented was greater. Its collapse, not just in its eastern European outpost, but in its Soviet heart- land represents an historical .turning point, though neither the end of history nor the unchallenged triumph of lib- eral democracy. Nevertheless, it is an occa- sion for joy. Communism was evil as much because of its mil- lenarian promises as in spite of them. To the true believer even the murder of millions could be justified by a cause sanctified by history's march towards bliss. For that alone, the death of communism merits rejoicing among both its erstwhile sub- jects and its erstwhile foes. True, the threats of eco- nomic chaos, ethnic conflict and the loss of control over the Soviet Union's vast destructive powers provide good reasons for anxiety. But they should not make one forget the most encouraging feature of this rev- olution: its sobriety. Heca- tombs were sacrificed to the god that failed, but it has per- ished with a whimper. The peo- ples of the erstwhile Soviet Union have been educated by communism to want not another bloody transformation, but an economy that allows them to prosper and a state that lets them breathe. Politically unsuccessful How simple these desires are; but how difficult they are to fulfil. The concerns to which communism was a response have, alas, not disappeared. Politically unsuccessful in its European birth-place, commu- nism was embraced by the would-be tyrants of poor societ- ies. From a prophecy about the future of the more advanced states, it became a programme for forced modernisation of the backward. With communism left only in one giant and a few min- nows, policy-makers in Moscow and Warsaw, along with those in New Delhi and Mexico City, now hope to achieve modernisation by Join- ing the liberal economy f the First World, rather than by imitating the autarky of the Second. The question for the west is not how to aid but whether to trade. It is a ques- tion that it would rather not answer. Capitalism's triumph Even if the west were to respond as it should - some- thing that protectionist lobbies will do their best to prevent - the global triumph of liberal capitalism would still not be assured. The western world is an island of peace, power and prosperity in a world of impov- erished, often desperate people. The magic of the market may offer hope, but when a sixth of the world's people enjoys two thirds of the world's income, that hope often seems remote. Disappointment is no fertile ground for liberal democracy, be it in Russia or in Brazil. Nor should one ignore an even more fundamental chal- lenge to liberal society, that from the prophets of environ- mental doom. They argue that many billions cannot hope to share the prosperity enjoyed by the few. If they are right, the challenge to liberalism would be severe. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby, liberal societies believe in the \"orgiastic future\". Free- dom and economic growth are Siamese twins. The energies released by freedom create .growth, while the hope of growth - of an ever bigger cake - underpins liberal democracy. In the absence of that hope, politics is bound to focus on the distribution of what already exists. Such zero- sum politics is certain to be fraught, not least because lib- eral democracy provides no strong justification for any par- ticular distribution of income, a difficulty that can be evaded only when there is hope of more for all. Liberal democracy and com- munism at least shared an optimistic view of the future, however much they disagreed over what it would be. But now Marx is dead, while the spectre that has returned to haunt lib- eral capitalism is that of a still earlier economist: only Thomas Malthus."

   "text_content" : "THE TRADES Union Congress meets this week in Glasgow, with its leaders in better heart than for some time. Congress managers appear to have stitched up an agenda which makes damaging splits unlikely (though the ability of the TUC to shoot itself in the foot should never be underesti- mated). And there is the realis- tic prospect of a government friendlier to the unions. Complacency, however, would be a mistake. For a start, Labour's poll lead is well short of a shoo-in. If the Con- servatives win, the proposals in their latest employment green paper on the deduction of subscriptions from pay could prove fatal to less well- organised unions. Plans to pro- hibit the Bridlington rules which stop TUC unions poach- ing members from each other could lead to internecine strife. And a change of government will do little to reverse the decline in union membership from 12m in 1979 to just over 8m last year. Unions may be less unpopular, but they find it hard to win members in the newer high-tech industries and services. The beauty contests in which unions underbid each other to persuade employers to Igrant repenatin rights in grenfeld actories are partic- ularly demeaning since the potential members are absent. On the credit side, the unions have survived the demise of much of their manu- acturing base. Falling mem- bership has spurred the merger oc (creating a handful of e eneral nions which does little to rationalise tie structure of reprscntatOn). And a series of goverumem laws has cleaned up some of the ik attctive practices of UK indstrial elation, such a strike decisions taken by show of hands in car parks.

These can be povmi ed r tively cheaply through union membership, as a form of mutual insurance policy. People doing particular forms of work have profes- sional interests which their unions can promote, as the BMA does so effectively for doctors, for example. And employees may have a distinc- tive viewpoint on issues such as employment law or health and safety which unions can articulate (though with only a third of the workforce in mem- bership, they can claim no monopoly of wisdom). Success stories The success stories of 1980s are those mainly non-TUC unions which have focused most closely on these goals and eschewed the battles of the past. The Royal College of Nursing, for example, has dou- bled in size by offering an impressive range of profes- sional services including careers counselling. It runs a political lobbying operation with a record in stirring up public support for nurses which chills the marrow of NHS employers and ministers. And nurses have shot up the pay gue since the RCN won its campagn for cdhunical grad- ig wtut a singleday lost through strikes. The Assistnt Masters and Mlistresses A d- ation has experienced simhar growth and campasged suc- cessfully for a lndepennt teachers' pay review body.

Labour's deoudence on t unions. Mr ichel gHowarod; ep annual' conference, and the ato l links between the two, There is muoch. ammunition: for instance, unions hold- 12 seats on the party's 29-seatationa executive ed to only seven for local constituency parties. i' As the TUC Congress gets under way in Glasgow today, the Conserva-t tives think talk of unions still benefits-. them - though unions' popularity ; tends to rise when they, are perceived to be weak. In 1979, some 82 per cent of people thought unions had too much power; last year the figure had fallen to 38 per cent. The Tories believe the fear that a Labour govern- ment would allow union leaders a say in legislation is an electoral problem. The union card is now being played so relentlessly that it has nettled Labour into defiance. \"Are you listen- ing, John Major? I am proud to be a member of the Transport and General Workers Union,\" declared Mr Nell Kinnock, the Labour leader, at the TGWU's biennial conference in July. Yet Mr Kinnock spent muth of the 1980s in an at best uneasy relation- ship with the country's biggest union, which has 1m votes at Labour's con- ference and sponsors 33 Labour MPs. The left-led TGWU's defiance of Mr Kinnock's attempts to change Labour's policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament led to much private sniping at the union from Labour offi- cials. Relations reached a nadir in 1988 when Mr Ron Todd, TGWU gen- eral secretary, bemoaned the slick new image of the party. \"There was a lot of deliberate provocation on both sides,\" says one TGWU official. But the links between unions and the Labour party are so deep that such rows resemble those of a mar- ried couple. The metaphor is used by Mr Bill Morris, who will take over from Mr Todd next year. '\"There will be no separation, no divorce,\" he says. How could there be, given the history and constitution of a party formed out of a vote at the 1899 Trades Union Congress to seek parliamentary repre- sentation for unions? There are three elements to the marriage: * History: More than any other European socialist party, Labour is rooted in class struggle. The efforts by Mr Kinnock to reform the party after , the huge defeat of the 1983 general election were criticised as betrayals of history. Unions say their mass mem- bership among working people is essential for the party. \"Without that, the party would just float away like a balloon without guyropes,\" says Mr John Edmonds, leader of the 920,000- member GMB general union. 0 Finance: Unions provide more than half Labour's income, although the decline in union membership has cut the proportion from 73 per cent five years ago to 53 per cent today. They are expected to provide much of the planned general election fund of at least Â£7m through affiliationfees. \"We do buy some priority and influ- ie '\"\"~a4\"-'-\"'\"' --~!~Â·---~i~lLÂ· I~Â·?--rl~Z1~Â·)FÂ·- Â·~^~Z~I~(R ence, although the relationship with the party has changed,\" says Mr Roger Lyons, the next general secre- tary of the MSS general technical union. * Policy: Unions remain integral to Labour policy-making although the union vote will be cut to 70 per cent of voting strength at the Labour confer- ence next year. In spite of the ten- sions, Mr Kinnock has depended on the unions to vote through policy reforms against the party's left on a range of issues, including Europe, public ownership and the way the party makes decisions. If no divorce is in prospect, party leaders have nevertheless decided that the relationship must change. They must show that unions do not exert undue influence, and will not do so under a Labour government.. \"There is no point pretending the relationship with the unions does not exist, but we have tried to define it differently,\" says Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman. A shift from their past involvement in government is also publicly accepted by unions. \"It is a different balance. Labour will govern and we will react to what it does,\" says Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. This nervousness about being part of government springs from bitter experiences dating back to the setting up of the National Economic Develop- ment Council by Mr Harold Mac- millan, the Conservative leader, in 1962. Mr Macmillan's logic - followed by prime minsters up to, but not including, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - was that unions could not be beaten and must be impelled to restrain wage demands by a sense of responsibility. Unions were pulled, often unwillingly, into uncomfortable compromise. Beyond this fear that both sides have of repeating the failed attempt at accommodation there are several rea- sons why Labour and most union leaders say they must redefine their relationship. First, there is the need to be elected. Labour strategists argue that 'There is no point pretending the relationship does not exist, but we have tried to define it differently' the party's conversion to consumer rights - a primary battleground of the next election - will not be taken seriously if people believe it is con- trolled by workers' interests. This has already led to some delicate manoeu- vring on issues such as Sunday trad- ing - vehemently opposed by the Usdaw shopworkers' union despite evidence that it is popular with con- sumers. Second, there is growing strain between Labour's wish to broaden its mass appeal as a social democratic party and the concentration of union membership in the public sector and among semi-skilled blue-collar work- ers. \"We have to win in parts of Britain where union density is very thin. To do that we have to be a big, democratic party with space for everyone,\" says Mr Sawyer of Nupe. Third, there is the blatant weakness of the party's policy-making process. \"Compared to other European social- ist parties, our method of making pol- icy is not even in the fourth division; it's in the Vauxhall League,\" says Mr Sawyer. Unions dominate votes at Labour conferences, and the meetings at which motions are drafted. The inability of constituency parties to influence policy leads to \"bitterness and irresponsibility\" among ordinary members, says Mr Edmonds. All these strains have led to a con- sensus that long-term reform is needed. The party laid plans in late 1980s for a gradual disengagement from unions. The three elements of the change were to be an attempt to build a mass membership of up to 1m by the coming election from the tradi- tional level of about 300,000; a weak- enibg of the unions' block vote accom- panied by a reformed policy-making process; and an eventual switch to state funding of political parties. The problem is that none of these changes has so far proved achievable. The mass membership campaign has been a conspicuous failure: member- ship now stands at 330,000. An offer to union members to join the party for only Â£5 has netted only 15,000 extra members in three years. \"I don't think true mass membership will happen - we are just not like that in Britain,\" says Ms Jenny Pardington, national co-ordinator of the Trade Unionists for Labour group. Mass membership is important if the party is to rid itself eventull the block vote by which all the O of a union are cast one way and 4o not reflect any internal split In oapin ion. Because the membership o coR- stituency parties is so small, even the 10 per cent of votes that they carry at the Labour conference is an over-rep- resentation. They hold 640,000 votes because each constituency party is allowed to vote as if it has 1,000 em- bers, whether it has 15 or 500. Until the constituencies can boost member- ship substantially, it will be difficult' to Justify giving them an increased percentage of votes compared to the unions. Under the allied policy-making changes, commissions, with members from local parties and affiliated orgn- isations, will debate aspects of po for up to two years. \"It will reduce the ibilityof some incoherent policy being made on the hoof o oon the conference floor,\" says Mr Edmonds. Yet whatever effect it has on the qual- ity of decisions, unions will remain an integral part of the revised process. The most sweeping change would be a switch to state nding of politi- cal parties. Labour has obvious motives for supporting this: the Tories are expected to gather an elec- tion fighting fund of up to M25m from business contributions. The 1984 Employment Act also requires unions to re-ballot members on whether they should have political funds by 1995. \"As long as we have undemocratic funding for the Tories, unions have to support Labour,\" says Mr Laird. The upshot is that no formal reform can occur before an election. This means Labour must rely on the elec- torate believing not only that there is a fresh informal understanding, but that this understanding will last under a Labour government. \"We know that if there is not a proper balance in the relationship with unions and employers, we will be severely undermined,\" says Mr Blair. Some unions are trying to enforce a more distant relationship with the Labour party. Mr Bill Morris wants more formal links at a lower level so that he and Mr Kinnock do not need to be constantly in touch on policy. Others say the 1980s policy changes mean the relationship is stronger as well as more distant. There is little doubt that relations between unions and Labour are more amiable than for some time, or that both sides want to keep their dis- tance. But the overriding question remains whether such distance could be preserved in government. The 1980s have been easy for unions in one respect; their leaders could denounce the government safe in the knowledge that it did not matter. Two recent incidents have reinforced the suspicion that Labour and the unions will find it hard to keep apart. First, the possibility of Mr Jack Adams, a Communist party member, being elected as TGWU dep- uty leader in preference to Mr Jack Dromey, has brought private criticism from Labour party officials. Second, Labour leaders have agreed to give union members a vote in the selection of MPs in some constituencies even if they were not members of the party. The concession was made after unions were unwilling to lose all vot- ing rights under one-person one-vote arrangements. Some Labour officials believe an important moment in power would come when the party first faced a choice between following union policy or consumer interests. They appear to relish the prospect of a fight similar to those in the 1980s which were partly engineered to show that the party was willing to defy its financial backers. But Labour must enter the election campaign with the unions at its side. They must face the spotlight together yet apart, agreeing on policy but emphasising that they are free to dif- ser. It will be a considerable balancing act before an election; it would be remarkable to maintain it afterwards.",

   "text_content" : "M. 111t1 today for w sac-i assesset a ,tw. peting, 1one .disc~i~u~on: the collapse o . .n. of Credit \"'anrdCom- eInternational, and the lessons it raies for the future of bank regulation. BCCI, with its massive fraud and still untold losses, has exposed such large failings in banking structures and raised such far-reaching questions about the way banks operate in the international markets that it is certain to create a land- mark in banking supervision. In fact the Stockholm meet- ing, being held under the aus- pices of the Basle Committee of international banking supervi- sors, will be only the first tiny step in what is likely to be a sweeping review of banking procedures that could last many years and involve dozens of countries. \"We're dealing here with the internationalisation of fraud,\" said Lord Alexander, chairman of the National Westminster Bank. \"They're going to have The regulators' meeting will be the first step in what is likely to be a sweeping review of international banking procedures to ask some very hard ques- tions.\" The meeting will be the first under the chairmanship of Mr Gerald Corrigan, the gravelly- voiced president of the New York Fed who, as chance would have it, was appointed only three days after BCCI was closed on July 5. At the time, he hailed the shutdown as an indication of the effectiveness of co-ordinated action between supervisors in different coun- tries (69 were involved). But his task today will be to ask whether better co-ordination could have prevented the crisis occurring in the first place. BCCI was able to get away with fraud on this enormous scale for as long as it did because it was careful never to develop a home country base where it would be subjected to the full scrutiny of the local banking authority. Registered in Luxembourg, it had its biggest business in the UK, but it \"parked\" its shadi- est assets in the Cayman Islands. This meant that the Luxembourg authority saw lit- tle of what was going on. The Bank of England had limited power because BCCI was not incorporated in the UK. The Cayman Islands, meanwhile, were not equipped to deal. with one of the largest frauds In his- tory. When BCCI was convicted of drug money laundering In the US in 1988, the Bank -of England conducted a thorough investigation of BCCI's UK branches but, possibly to its surprise, fouind aotwi bor- mal.This sueste thatBCCI was adept at keeping its ques- tionable activities out of the more closely supervised coun- tries. Already there have been calls for drastic measures to prevent another BCCI, such as the creation of a new supra-na- tional banking regulator. With the rapid internationalisation of the banking markets, and the eruption of fraud as a big problem in many countries, the pressure for action is strong. But banking officials will be trying to put the brakes on a rushed response. Mr Coirigan is believed to be opposed to cosmic solutions, partly because BCCI is a highly untypical banking case. Another senior banking official close to the BCCI affair says: \"What we want to avoid is a knee-jerk reaction\". Instead, officials will be try- ing to isolate the key issues arising from BCCI. There appear to be several * Supervision of cross-border banking. Supervisors addressed this problem back in the 1970s when the Basle Com- mittee drew up its \"concordat\" which allotted responsibility between the \"home\" authority and the \"host\" authority for a bank operating across borders. This would ensure, it was thought, that no bank could escape supervision. The con- cordat was toughened in 1983 after the Banco Ambrosiano scandal. But BCCI proved that it was still possible for a deter- mined bank to evade the super- visory net. Eight years later, the concor- dat is clearly ripe for another review. One solution may be for the authorities to require every bank to have a clearly defined \"home\", preferably in the country where it has its principal business. -j New banking legisaihon being considered by the US Congress would give the Fed- eral Reserve the power to require any foreign- bank et- ting up a branch in the US to identify its principal overseas supervisor. But BCCI has also raised questions about the adequacy of existing supervision in cer- tain countries. The small resources of Luxembourg and Cayman, for example, were clearly factored into BCCI's calculations about where it placed its business. Ms Sydney Key, an econo- mist with the Federal Reserve and co-author of a recent study on the problems of supervising international banks, argues that the Basle concordat is too narrow in scope, and covers too few countries. \"We need a more formal agreement than Basle,\" she* says, proposing that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the Organ- isation for Economic Coopera- tion and Development would be a suitable forum for a wide- ranging review of these issues. 0 Consolidated supervision. Again, supervisors thought they had addressed this prob- they encbuiaged batiks to con- soqlate the accounts of all the*dlvisiols ard sUbsidiaries into a single complete picture. Bat this is more easily said than done. BCCI had a highly coniples and fragmented struc- ture to which it added further opaqueness for many years by insisting on having two sepa- rate auditors. Furthermore, the steady international expansion by large banks, and their diver- sification into different lines of busiind snfch as securities and iniurance is producing ever dtre complex holding com- pany, tructires - often with the encouragement of supervi- sors who like banks to build \"firtwells\" around the riskier part of their business. This trend is likely to accelerate as financial deregulation prog- resses in countries such as the US. and Japan. The EC is drawing up a Con- solidated Supervision Directive which will embody the princi- ple that primary supervision should be carried out in the country where the bank has its main business. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Biank of England, has tory crcks, and the system needs to be able to handle tdem; Supervisors dealt with BCCI by creating a \"college\" of offi- als from countries where it was most active. But the sorry tale of BCCI suggests that a college turns into a game of pass the parcel. The UK, Lux- embourg and the US all, at some stage, told BCCI to remove operations from their jurisdictions. Someone has to take direct responsibility for outlyers, and assume the role of lender of last resort. Most significant develop- ments in banking supervision in the past have been in response to crises: Herstatt, Ambrosiano, the US Savings & Ioans. BCCI will now set the latest milestone along that bumpy road. But as well as responding to the issues raised by BCCI, Mr Corrigan and his; committee will also, no doubt, want to anticipate the next one. With banking in its pres- ent disordered and uncertain state, that will not be an easy task.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Lino Terlimn. Sir, Antonia Sharpe writes (27 August) about a report on the petrochemical market by County NatWest WoodMac which, as far as Montedison is concerned, merits some corrections. Montedison is neither solely, nor even mainly, a petrochemi- cal company. It is a global, complex, diver- sified group, with activities in: the chemical sector, including high value-added materials, accounting for 23 per cent of 1990 consolidated sales and 28 per cent of consolidated gross operating profit (GOP); the pharmaceuticals sector, accounting for 9 per cent of sales and 9 per cent of GOP; the energy sector, accounting for 3 per cent of sales and 14 per cent of GOP; and the agro- industrial sector, accounting for 62 per cent of sales and 46 per cent of GOP. The latter three sectors, which together account for about 70 per cent of Montedi- son's GOP, are either counter- cyclical or completely indepen- dent from the typical clical- ity of the petrochemical stor. Himont is the major Mont- edison subsidiary active in the petroc-emics sector. Appro- imately 25 per cent of its total sales are not subject to petro- chemicals volatility (cataly- sers, licensing and advanced materials) and a significant percentage of the remaining sales consist of a wide range of products with special charac- teristis that make them less cyclical than polypropylene About 55 per cent of imont's polymer sectr sales originate from non-Europan countries, where the pricing dynamic andl/or a greater nmam- ber of raw material supply sources ensure a higher level of profitability than in FInaly, it should be noted that In I , Himout's nominal production capacity was 2m tonnes the volume of sins soM an the markrt was LU Aacording to cuet avail able infaeation, the utils- tion rate for Himons ints fr the whole I t 1 = oaMld rmain at 87 per cent. -. =MMINAM",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Midchael Waton. Sir, It is understandable that the stock market and investors should express scepticism over the valuation of unlisted investments held in the portfo- lios of investment trusts subse- quent to the collapse of one investment trust involved in venture capital and some dra- matic reductions in valuations elsewhere. Discussion of this problem, and the market's reaction to it, has done little justice to the time and effort that non-execu- tive directors on the boards of investment trusts devote to considering the valuation of unlisted investments. The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) guidelines set out principles of valuation and disclosure requirements for members of the BVCA when reporting to investors in venture capital funds. The principles of valuation described differ little from principles that boards of investment trusts have adopted in the past. The disclo. sure requirements ensure that the managers of venture capl- tal funds disclose to investors in those funds how each valua- tion has been arrived at. Because such reports are privi- leged communications between managers and investors, it is possible to be very open about the reasons for changes in val- uation, even when such disclo- sures would in other circum- stances be damaging to investee companies. It is not possible for the accounts of investment trusts, which are public documents, to be so fran about the paeor- mance of investee companes, particularly when such da nies are in financial ties; to do might pealdkae the companies prospect. The valuation ofunlisted investments within investeant trust portfolios is the respodsi- bility of the boards of thoes trusts, the managers of tkob making available al reletnt information to those boards to enable them to fulfll that duty propetly. It is also the duty of the auditors of the trust to oelnre that boards have had ielbrant and accurate lnformatioh =ad available to them to enable them to form a proper view of valuations. In addition, the board of a trust rl have had the ppor- tuity to forin a view of the levirel of pruidence manae adopt in pposing vauations becamu they win, over suveral years, havte oprtunity to co r those vatio s with d values. They are in a good poiton to Judge whether valuatim are aropriate and the dalogue that takes place betweei a mabags and boards wMlltuia a-rrie at a con- ?.h arhet and inveators houl W hot conclude that bieoibi a few tWita nvolved th the M si eulathiv ed of the vntur capital industry have ot luans on that the vast malority of hivestment truts involved in udlistd intvestent are not rodi g fair and resonable vualm of their putollo. uIMbl Walton G*iAiwe w"

   "text_content" : "By Charles Goodhart and Antonis Demos Where are the - main centres for interna- tional cur- ^--[^WV rency trading n the world today? The answer will ii shed light on the relative strength and coh- petitiveness of dissert sinan- cial centres. But it is one about which there has been relatively little information. Because the foreign exchange market is an elec- tronic/telephone market, with bid and ask quotes displayed on screens and deals done over the telephone, there are- no aggregate data for the volume of transactions. This ga in data has been partially illed by occasional central bank sur- veys, the latest of which took place in April 1989. Such surveys have shortcom- ings. Among other thigs, not allcentral banks participate, notably the Bundesbank; the surveys take place over the short period of one month: and they do not provide a complete breakdown of transaction by individual currency. We have complemented such survey data by taking informa- tion from a different source, the quotes on Reuters screens, where the relevant foreign exchange page gives the loca- tion of each bank branch sup- plying the quote. We collected continuous data of all foreign exchange quotes, day and night, weekends too, for 12 weeks, :April 9-Jiine 29 1989, amounting to nearly Im indi- vidual quotes. These are sepa- rated into currency - in all cases bilateral with the US dol- lar (Fl is the Dutch guilder) - and location, ranging from London with 164,755 quotes to Riyadh with six. To save space we report the share in each currency of the 15 largest cen- tres, ranked by aggregate num- ber of Reuters quotes. These data will also have disadvantages as a guide to the volume of transactions, since variations in Reuters' share of business in each centre and currency will lead to conse- quent biases in the relation- ship between the number of quotes and total transactions. In particular, there are com- paratively few Reuters quotes emanating from Tokyo, given the known volume of foreign exchange transactions there. Nevertheless, the table clearly demonstrates the con- centration of all EC centres, except London, in just one or two currency markets: their domestic currency and, in some cases, the D-Mark or Ecu as well. Over this period there were no Reuters quotes at all for the pound sterling from Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Utrecht or Milan. This does not, of course, mean that no spot deals were made in this currency in these centres; but it does suggest that such cen- tres played little role in fixing the market price. Besides Lon- don, only Zurich, and to a lesser extent Copenhagen and Oslo, could be described as international European cen- tres, if the term implies mak- ing markets in all leading cur- rencies. Of these last three centres, only Copenhagen is in the EC, andit is ha1 y comn petitive with London. London is clearly the foreign exchange' centre for the Community as a whole. Besides the predominant role of London in Europe, the data indicate how enormously important Singapore and Hong Kong have become as interna- tional Asian markets. Even if the comparatively low ranking of Tokyo is discounted as a result of bias, the Asian mar- ket is shown to be triple-cen- tred, in contrast to the single. centred North American mar- ket, and the European struc- ture of single centre, sur- rounded by important domestic-oriented markets. To conclude, there are six truly important international centres: London, New York, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and Zurich. There are four medium-sized international centres: Sydney, Copenhagen, Toronto and Oslo. The rest are either small international cen- tres, for example, Wellington, Melbourne, Bahrain and Los Angeles, or specialist centres, usually in the domestic cur- rency. Charles Goodhart and Antonis Demos are members of the Financial Markets Group, Lon- don School of Economics.

   "article_dc_title" : "UK Recession 'Likely to End This Year'",
   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff THE UK recession is likely to end this year, but its aftermath - rising unemployment and falling business investment - will mean low growth, sluggish factory output and ballooning public spending in 1992, according to the Financial 'imes' summer compilation of 23 forecasts. The compilation of forecasts from university economists, independent think-tanks, and City investment houses, is pub- lished today. Pay settlements in manufac- turing will fall towards 5 per cent this autumn, from a peak above 9 per cent last year, spurring productivity growth in spite of an increase in sac- tory output of only 2 per cent next year. Overall, the forecast- ers predict gross domestic product to rise by an average 1.7 per cent next year - by less than the government has forecast - after a fall of more than 2 per cent in 1991. In spite of retail price infla- tion's fall to a forecast annual rate below 4 per cent next year, the government will be unable to cut interest rates below 10 per cent before the election. Political nervousness will mount as the election nears, making sterling vulnerable on the foreign exchanges. This constraint underscores Economlsf disagree about timing of recovry.. Page 6 CBI finds moderate optnimim................... Page 6 the government's inability to stop unemployment rising by another 400,000 to a forecast peak of 2.8m in 1992. Though pay settlements will fall, com- panies will be forced to shed labour to cut costs. \"Wage slowdown is the big event of the autumn,\" says Mr Giles Keating,'economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"Manufacturing unit labour cost increases will fall rapidly, reaching about 2 per cent this time next year.\" If the forecasters are proved correct and there is a quick and lasting change in UK wage and price setting fromn-this autumn this will raise hopes that the UK has adjusted rap- idly to the discipline of being in the European exchange rate mechanism. It suggests that wage-setters are lowering pay awards in recognition of the government's pledge that; it will not devalue the pound. One lasting effect of the recession next year will be the deterioration in the govern- ment's finances, the forecast finds. Borrowing in 1991-1992 will .rise to Â£15.5bn, around 6 per cent of GDP from around 2 per cent of this year, as benefit payments rise, and tax reve- nues continue to drop. Forecasters fear that Mr Nor- man Lamont, the chancellor, will have difficulty managing the upswing and the pound simultaneously. A decision to narrow sterllngs bands within the ERM is ruled out as-a pre- election possibility by most. Currencies in the narrow fluc- tuation band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. Sterling and the Spanish peseta operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Singapore SINGAPORE'S ruling People's i Action party (PAP) may aban- i don a limited liberalisation i programme following opposi- i tion successes in elections on Saturday, party leaders said i yesterday. I The PAP won 77 of 81 parlia- 1 mentary seats, but its share of 1 the popular vote fell to 61 per i cent from 63.2 per cent at the 1 last election in 1988. The oppo- sition took four seats compared i to one in 1988. Mr Goh Chok Tong, the 4 prime minister, said he was \"disappointed\" by his failure to 1 win a solid endorsement for i the more liberal style he has i adopted since taking over from 1 Mr Lee Kuan Yew in Novem- I ber. He said he was considering i whether to \"modify\" his style I of government, which has led 1 to an easing of censorship reg- 1 ulations and more conciliatory treatment of political oppo- nents. He also raised fears of a crackdown against opposition ( candidates accused of trying to i win votes by exploiting differ- i ences between Singapore's Chi- i nese majority and the Malay and Indian minorities. i Political activity along eth- i nic or religious lines is banned in Singapore. The accused can- didates could face prosecution, or detention without trial. Mr Goh said the election showed Singaporeans wanted a strong opposition in parlia- ment, but warned that the PAP would scrap existing provi- sions for scrutiny of ministers by government backbenchers. \"The PAP will now play the role of a conventional govern- ing party in a two-party politi- cal system,\" he said. The election was a triumph for Mr Chiam See Tong, leader of the Singapore centrist Dem- ocratic party, who will become the first leader of the opposi- tion since the late 1960s. Mr Chiam was the architect of an agreement among the five opposition parties to concede the election in advance by nominating candidates for only 40 of the 81 seats. PAP leaders conceded that voters had responded to Mr Chiam's claim that they could safely vote for opposition can- didates without risking the defeat of the government. The SDP won three seats, and came within three percent- age points of winning three 1~8...... -A- -- M fluff FlÂ·h F'k.Â· MA'f others. The centre-left Workers party, formerly the biggest opposition party, took one seat. The poll result will weaken Mr Goh's support within the PAP, but is unlikely to result in a leadership change in the short term. However, Mr Goh will come under pressure to step down if the PAP loses fur- ther seats in by-elections prom- ised within 18 months. End of one-party state, Page 4",

   "text_content" : "By Leyla Boullon in Moscow and George Graham in Washington MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, yesterday indicated he was ready to accept independence for the three Baltic republics of Lith- uania, Latvia and Estonia. Mr Gorbachev appeared to accept their often-stated goal of independence when he said in a television interview: \"If that is the ultimate will and the intention of the peoples of these republics, I believe we have to accept this.\" Mr Gorbachev did not say, as he has before in this context, that they must observe a legally determined five-year period of negotiations with the centre before they would be allowed to sepamte. President Vytautas Lands- bergis last night hailed Mr Gor- bachev's acceptance of Baltic independence, saying Lithua- nia was entering a new period of history. \"I am glad he has said this. This is the beginning of a new period of histo- ry ... Now there must be concrete talk on the with- drawal of Soviet troops,\" Mr Landsbergis said. In a further boost for the republic's independence cause, it appeared yesterday that the US would give full recognition today to the Baltic republics. Mr Landsbergis said earlier yesterday, after speaking to President George Bush, that he was sure Mr Bush would today announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with his country, or in some way recog- nise its independence. Independence for the Baltics is to be discussed at the ses- sion of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the highest Soviet legislative body, which opens today. In Moscow last night the three Baltic prime ministers said they would refuse to sign an economic agreement now being mooted by the economic comn mittee in Moscow even though they would do everything pos- sible to preserve and develop trade with the Soviet Union. \"Putting aside the political situation, we have to do all we can to ensure these (trade) ties do not collapse,\" said Mr Ivars Godmanis, the Latvian pre- mier. The prime ministers said they planned to create a Bene- lux-style monetary union but remained cagey as to when they would replace the rouble wi their own national cur- rencies. Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, the Lithuanian premier, said his republic's new currency, the litas, was \"ready\" but would not be introduced in the near ftture. Asked whether he would subscribe until then to a com- mon financial stabilisation pol- icy for the roubsle Mr Vagnor- ins said he believed it would take a least another yer for such a policy to matiale \"But if they do manage something, we will welcome it,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Normn Cohen, Investments Correspondent INSTITUTIONAL shareholders are pressing the Accounting Standards Council to compel companies to give more infor- mation about their finances and their relationships with their auditors. The National Association of Pension funds has written to the ASC asking it to consider measures including establish- ing a new reporting format similar to the 10K report US companies have to file under Securities and Exchange Com- mission rules. US-style reporting require- ments have long been anath- ema to British companies. Most of those seeking a US shareholder bape have opted to issue ADRs rather than seek a full stock exchange listing, which would involve comply- ing with reporting require- ments they regard as onerous. The NAPS, which represents many of the UK's largest insti- tutional shareholders, believes that a standardised reporting format would facilitate com- parisons between companies and give investors more com- plete information. The letter also suggests that conglomerates be required to disclose profits information about their subsidiaries, allow- ing investors to see each unit's contribution to group earnings. Also, companies should be required to disclose the remita- bility of profits - the extent to which a parent company can use profits generated by a sub- sidiary in another country. Investment managers said Polly Peck should have been required to disclose fully the \"ring fence\" around earnings of its US-based Del Monte sub- sidiary and its non-remittable profits from Northern Cyprus. The NAPS is urging that companies disclose the location of assets in order to avoid con- fusion about beneficial control. This would, for instance, force Hanson to make fuller disclo- sure about operations under the control of various Cayman Islands subsidiaries. Separately, the NAPS has expressed concern about the relationship between compa- nies and their auditors. It has suggested that auditing firms be required to change the part- ner responsible for each corpo- rate account bom time to time. Also, the group has urged that companies be required to disclose all their relationships with their auditors, including the provision of management or computing consultancy ser- vices.",

   "text_content" : "New highs in the London equity market are becoming as routine as scandals in Tokyo, but with a great deal less obvi- ous justification. The economy remains sullen, and the for- ward indicators listed in Greenwell Montagu's new recession watch remain over- whelmingly negative. British corporate boards are delivering their own verdict in a new wave of rights issues, cashing in on a sellers' market before it is too late. They at least can remember 1987. The conditions are right for another bout of midsummer madness. The markets are thin, and the brokers hungry. The news from the Soviet Union is dramatic enough to distract all but the most deter- mined attention from uncom- sortable facts at home. An ideal time, in short, to run the index up the flagpole and see if any- one salutes. A contrarian, though, must dismiss this as facile thinking. All the bad news listed here is well known, and any future bad news (except the one item which is the main subject of this column) is unlikely to sur- prise, so the market has nowhere to go but up. This would be more persua- sive if contrarians had not been saying much the same in 1987, but one thing has changed since then. This time, the market is not really high at all. It has fallen by a quarter in real terms since 1987, and its 4.65 per cent dividend yield looks very generous when viewed from any other major bourse. And, of course, we could still be surprised by recovery; as Mr Alan Green- span of the Fed has pointed out, recovery nearly always does come when it is least expected. So far, the argument looks like a stand-off - which is exactly what you should expect in a reasonably efficient mar- ket. However, it leaves out one factor which is peculiar to the British market. It is of funda- mental importance, but is only partially discounted, and is hardly ever discussed. It is the sterling exchange rate. This silence is odd. The rate chosen by the British authori- ties when they locked in to the ERM less than a year ago caused much surprise over- seas. Reports from Frankfurt spoke of \"insanity\"; my friends in Washington conveyed the same thought in more moder- ate terms. They spoke of a pro longed recession, pressure on profit margins and falling investment, which all looks reasonably prophetic. In London, however, there was simply a brief discussion about whether a downward adjustment would help to get By Anthony Harris interest rates down, which rightly concluded that it would not, since it would simply arouse the fear of a series of devaluations, French style. After that, silence in the City. The rate was chosen, endorsed by both the main British political parties, and thereafter the subject was unsuitable for polite conversa- tion. The rate might be uncom- sortable, but to question it could only make matters worse (as if the markets could not do their own sums). This self- imposed taboo seems to have been as complete as that which was imposed by Mr Harold Wil- son ahead of the 1967 devalua- tion. Now it has been broken, thank goodness, by the National Institute for Eco- nomic and Social Research in its current Review. The genie is out of the bottle, but its escape has not caused any flurry in the markets, which, after all, impose an interest rate penalty on sterling just because the question is clearly not quite closed. No harm done, you might think. In the long run, though, it could make life still more diffi- cult for the Treasury, since it provides a rational basis for questioning British policy. This is not as simple as you might think, because argu- ments about exchange rates tend to hit the buffers when defenders of a given rate argue: A. That there is no such thing as a \"right\" rate, but just a difference of opinion. B: That even if the real rate of exchange is thought to be wrong, there is nothing to be done about it, since it is a mar- ket rate. However John Williamson, a British economist working in Washington, who has down the years written more sense about exchange rates than all the official economists in London put together, explodes both these arguments, and does so with the hoist with your own petard approach; he uses essen- tially market criteria. How do you judge whether an exchange rate is adequately competitive? Not by arguing as Treasury ministers like to do (and as Harold Wilson did in his time) that our exports are competitive. Are they ade- quately profitable? Not by arguing, as the CBI likes to do, that our labour costs are not out of line. This is like arguing that British athletics is com- petitive because one Scottish woman and a relay squad got golds, when the question is how many athletes win med- als. Our manufacturing sector may be too small. Purchasing power parity, which would make the price of a mythical basket of goods the same the world over, is no help either, although many econo- mists (the Goldman Sachs team, for example) argue as if rates were always trying to reach it. Countries which are strong internationally, whether through natural resources or skill or sheer financial cun- ning, will tend to be compara- tively expensive to live in, since ordinary barbers and market gardeners share in the prosperity through high prices and incomes. Remember your last cup of coffee in Tokyo or Zurich? You cannot even, according to Williamson, argue froni the balance of payments. Some fast-developing economies import capital (and thus run a current deficit) for many years on end, and others export capi- tal (the Japanese, for example, saving for an ageing popula- tion). The test is subtler - a sustainable capital account (and thus current account) at a sustainable rate of growth. Britain pretty clearly fails this test. Even in a deep reces- sion, we need to attract hot money to finance our routine outward investment; in any recovery we will have to pull in more, at higher interest rates. That is not sustainable in the financial sense. We have played this gnome game before, and it ends in collapse. Nor is it sustainable in Williamson's delightful politi- cal definition: \"A path that can be followed without surprises that would make agents wish ex post that they had acted dif- ferently.\" Mr Major's life seems full of such surprises. This suggests that some day he or a successor will act dif- ferently. The aim, on William- son's figures, would be a real devaluation of 11 per cent; others might give or take a few points. There are two questions for the reader: do you agree, and do you think this probabil- ity is discounted in today's market? My answers would be Yes and No, respectively.",

   "text_content" : "JAPAN'S role as leading banker to the world has been blunted this year. The huge tide of long-term funds that Japan invested overseas during the 1980s has begun washing home again. Japan's long-term capital account was in the black by $7.78bn in the first seven months of the year, the first surplus since 1980. The abrupt, and enormous reversal of capital flows - Japan exported more than $130bn annually between 1986 and 1988 - seems surprising since it is happening just as Japan's current account sur- plus is leaping up. Japan's cumulative surplus in the first seven months of the year rose by 94 per cent during 1990 to $33.97bn. Other things being equal, the large current account surplus should make it easier for Japan to invest abroad. In response to critics of its current account surplus, in years past, Japan could always say the country was playing a constructive role by recycling the surplus and adding extra savings generated in Japan. In 1988, for example, when Japan's current surplus was $79.6bn, its long-term capital balance was $130.9bn in the red. Japanese investors played an important part in supporting the US budget deficit by buy- ing US government bonds and they have bought foreign cor- porate bonds and shares by the billions. With the US having become the world's biggest debtor nation, and with Germany's surplus of mlods absorbed by the cost of reunification, Japan was at least expected to have a capital surplus that could, for example, support the recon- struction of eastern Europe or even the tUS ecnmiabt recov- Instead lon-term catal is poing back into Japan.

The omplex anser is that Japan is p-a through an atraordinary prones of read- justment following the sinan- cial excesses of the 1960s. While economists see the simultaneous surpluses in the current and long-term capital accounts as an aberration that will be corrected by market forces, no one knows when, or with what magnitude, the tide of investment rands will go out again. One magnet for investors has been the high level of Japa- nese interest rates relative to inflation, which has made bond yields attractive. The Bank of Japan pushed up the official discount rate in five stages from May 19, and cut it for the first time by half a point to 5.5 per cent on July 1. Despite the high rates, demand for credithroughout the economy remains strong as Japanese companies struggle to keep investment pro- grammes on tra. Most have been willing so far, to pay the extra cost.

Foreign net purchases of Japanese equities in the first seven months of the year came to $23.27bn, compared to net sales of .9M4bn last year. For stocks and bonds together the purchases came to $60.24bn, about four times last year's total for the same period. Japanese purchases of for- eign securities are roughly in line with recent years, although bonds are favoured over equities. Underlying these large shifts is the unstoppable momentum of the real economy, which the Bank of Japan is trying to tame without killing. The remarkable strength of that momentum was illustrataed in a recent Bank of Japan bulletin on the flow of famns fr 190. Japanese corporate Invest- ment rose from 159 per cent of GNP In I1 to 1 per cent in 190, but during the same detanine e gs plus ueprecuul e Riom 11 per cent to S9 per cent of GNP.

A range of other statistics illustrate that 1990 was an important turning point. For the first time in 1( years both the amount of new capital raised and invested by the non- financial sector shrank as a percentage of GNP. Also for the first time in 16 years, the value iof tradeable financial assets held by the non-financial sector fell, mainly as a result of the stock market crash. External trans- actions fell.

As a result, in part, of capital iflowing into Japan, the yen hAs gone up in value, contributing directly to the rise in the current account surplus by making imports cheaper and expdrts more dear.

   "text_content" : "By Robrt Peton POWER Corporation, the Irish property developer, has been threatening to put Brent Walker into receivership. This threat led indirectly to the allegation that a key letter, promising financial support to Brent Walker and pur- porting to be written by Power Corporation's chairman; had been forged. The allegedly forged letter is at the centre of the Serious Fraud Office's investigations into Brent Walker, which began last Wednesday at the request of the troubled leisure group. For a year Power and Brent Walker have been in talks to unwind their property joint ven- ture, Walker Power. In April, heads of agreement were signed to split Walker Power's assets between them but the deal was not completed. Power became impatient and in the past few weeks it has threat- ened, as 50 per cent owner of Walker Power, to call in Walker Power's loans to Brent Walker. It also warned it could invoke a guarantee given by Brent Walker to cover shortfalls in Walker Power's property rents. In effect, it *as threatening to put Brent W\"alker into receivership. Power believes its interests couild be served if Brent Walker weht into receivership, because a receiver might unscramble the venture more quickly than Brent W\"lker's management. But Brent Walker thought Pdwer's threats were empty. It has a letter, apparently signed on November 20, 1990, by Mr Robin Pwer, chairman of Power and miaging director of Walker Power, promising that Walker Power will maintain financial support to Brent Walker. The letter says that Mr Power concurs with a letter written the day before by Mr George Walker, then chief executive of Brent Walker and chairman of Walker Power. Mr Walker's letter waives Walker Power's rights to call in loans and invoke guarantees. The waiver was a condition of agreement from Brent Walker's banks that they would not call in their Â£lbn of loans. Mr Walker believed he had the authority to give the waiver but Hill Samuel, Brent Walker's merchant bank adviser, insisted that Mr Power also give his agreement, because of Power Corporation's big stake. Forensic experts have now dis- covered that Mr Power's signa- ture is not authentic. Mr Walker, deposed as chief executive at the end of May, said he had been convinced the letter was written by Mr Power. He said a copy of the letter was sent to Mr Power's lawyer within weeks of it arriving and he could not understand why Mr Power had not disowned it earlier.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "r Hans Rausing, the Swedish businessman who heads the Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval food processing and packaging group, has found a fresh challenge in life. Apart from taking a more active role running the group since Tetra Pak's SKrl6.25bn (Â£1.52bn) acquisition of the Alfa- Laval food processing equipment company earlier this year, Mr Rausing believes he can help develop the Soviet Union's food distribution system. Mr Rausing, 65, who has built Tetra Pak into one of the world's most innovative and successful packaging companies, well understands the problems of the Soviet market: he speaks Russian and has regularly visited the country since 1958. He is convinced that the com- pany can play an important role in improving the quality of Soviet life - as well as firmly entrenching itself in a vast and largely untapped market. Mr Rausing could serve as a role model for ambitious Soviet entrepreneurs: in 40 years he has helped to build Tetra Pak into one of the world's biggest packag- ing companies. The company is still wholly- owned by the Rausings making them one of Europe's richest fam- ilies. Estimates of their wealth range from' $3.5bn (Â£2.1bn) to almost $10bn although this is somewhat notional as the family has no intention of selling and ploughs all its dividends back into the company. Sitting outside the modest fish- erman's cottage in Sweden that serves as his summer house, Mr Rausing says it is a moral imper- ative and an economic necessity to provide financial assistance to the Soviet Union. \"Without food and without other consumer products the Soviet Union will remain unstable and dangerous,\" he says. He believes aid should be tar- geted at removing the bottle- Hans Rausing: hoping to help the Soviet Union develop its food distribution system necks in the Soviet economy to unleash its productive forces. \"The investment must be spd- cific. It is not a question of a little company investing here or there. What we are looking at is 0 massive release of productive forces in the country and that means we must remove the bottle necks.\" Mr Rausing is clear where the problems lie in food distribution and believes that the company's combined expertise can play a big role in relieving them. Indeed, Tetra Pak is already heavily committed to doing so. Tetra Pak's particular exper- tise is in the field of liquid food packaging where it has kept; a technological edge since 1951 when the company's founder - and Hans's father - Mr Ruben Rausing invented the tetrahedron carton. Last year the company produced -ahd distributed 57bn cartons to more than 100 coun- tries. Tetra Pak has invested SKrI.5bn in three joint ventures in the Soviet Union: in Lipetsk, Podolsk and Kiev. It also plans further investment of more than SKr2bn making it one of the big- gest western investors in the region. Mr Rausing says proper pack- aging and the effective mainte- nance of machinery could save much wasted food in the Soviet Union. And he estimates almost half the food produced in the country never reaches the con- sumer. \"I have seen a dairy in the Soviet Union which had been running at only half capacity for six weeks and all because of a lack of a spare part worth $200,\" he says. Mr Rausing says investment in the Soviet Union makes commer- cial sense. For a comparatively small outlay he says that Tetra Pak can win a sizeable share of a potentially huge market. \"If you were to try to achieve that same market share in the US it would cost you 10, maybe 100, times more,\" he says. He recognises the threat that the political disintegration of the Soviet Union poses to western investments but argues that, whatever constellation of national governments emerges, there will always be a need for food distribution expertise. Mr Rausing says western joint ventures have a crucial role in transferring expertise to the Soviet peoples and believes com- mercial loans should be chan- neled through these joint ven- tures. Western governments could provide the loans in hard cur- rency to be repaid in roubles - the collapse of Soviet exports making it impossible for the country to generate sufficient hard currency for the foreseeable future, according to Mr Rausing. He sees Tetra Pak as a prime candidate for such loans. \"I can achieve a certain result with the means of Tetra Pak but if we are talking about large quick improvements in the food supply we need more money. \"Tetra Pak is trying to remove the bottle necks in packaging and Alfa Laval can relieve the bottle necks in the baby food industry. There is a lot of capacity that can be utilised. Tetra Pak can use $1bn a year for five years,\" he says. any of Tetra Pak's com- petitors would no doubt feel uneasy about such financial assistance being given to the company considering its aggressive reputation. In July, the European Commis- sion fined the company a record Ecu75m (Â£52.8m) for abusing its dominant market position in western Europe claiming Tetra Pak had pursued a \"deliberate policy aiming to eliminate actual or potential competitors.\" Mr Rausing denies the charge and says Tetra Pak will appeal against the fine. He believes the charge has no relevance to its investment plans in the Soviet Union. He sums up his philoso- phy of business: \"Every company is run to make a profit. If it does not it will die. But it has to sup- ply some kind of service to the benefit of society.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based trading group, has appointed a merchant bank and a stockbroker to handle the flo- tation of its subsidiary, Jardine Insurance Brokers, in the autumn. The flotation is expected to value Jardine Insurance brokers at between Â£150m and Â£200m. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and Cazenove, the stock- brokers, will work with Jardine, which is seeking to sell just under under half of its subsid- iary. Jardine employees will be offered priority access to a per- centage of the shares on offer. The move will be the latest in a string of overseas listings by the Jardine Matheson group. In the past 15 months four subsidiaries - Jardine Strategic Holdings, the hotel group, Mandarin Oriental International, the property company, Hong- kong Land, and the retailer Dairy Farm International - have been listed in London and New York. The group is also negotiating with the Hong Kong authorities to move its primary listing to London in the face of political uncertainty in Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 when sover- eignty over the colony returns to China. JIB expanded its wholesale, reinsurance and retail brokerage during the 1980s, acquiring a number of brokerages in the UK, the US, Australasia and Hong Kong. Led by chief executive, Mr John Barton, Jardine handles annual premiums of more than Â£lbn and employs around 3,600 people. In 1990 revenues from broker- age commissions and investment income amounted to $320.6m (Â£190.8m) of which $276.3m came from brokerage fees and commis- sions and $44.3m from other income, including investment income. Pre-tax profits amounted to $32.7m. This performance ranks Jar- dine among the leading ten 10 brokers in the world and among the top five in the UK. The offer is expected to ease access to capital markets, allow- ing JIB to press ahead with expansion at a time when pros- pects for the insurance broking sector are reasonably bright. Rates for commercial insur- ance and reinsurance remain soft in the US and Europe, but are increasing in some parts of the market - especially in the Lon- don marine, aviation and rein- surance markets, where Jardine has a strong presence.",

   "text_content" : "By MWshlyN Naklunm LIBERTY, the high street retailer which faces stake- building by a South African investor group, said that in the event of a hostile bid, it would accept an offer by its Japanese partners to step in as a white knight. The UK department store group, with its flagship in Lon- don's west end, is bracing itself for a protracted siege after it was revealed that Mr Brian Myerson, an expatriate South African investor, was behind a dawn raid three weeks ago that lifted the shares 17 per cent on the day. Liberty believes Mr Myerson holds around 35,000 of the vot- ing shares, or less than one per cent, and around 70,000 of the non-voting shares. That holding is not large enough to pose a threat to the group while over 50 per cent of its shares are controlled by members of the founding fam- ily. However, Mr Myerson was responsible for a similar raid last year on Aquascutum, the classic clothing company, which eventually led to a rec- ommended bid for the group by Renown, the Japanese clothing group. He was also, until 1989, a major shareholder in Oceana Investment Corporation, the South African oup which recently launched a hostile bid for Etam. Although Mr Myerson was not planning to bid for the group, he wants to acquire more shares in a company he believes is undervalued, according to a spokesman. In his raid three weeks ago Mr Myerson was able to acquire only about 10,000 shares. The only sizeable stake unconnected to the founding family members, is the 20 per cent held by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. Although Liberty has a two- tier share structure like Aqua- scutum, its articles provide non-voting shareholders with far fewer rights than Aqua- scutum's did. It would there- fore not be vulnerable to a sim- ilar challenge from non-voting shareholders as that which eventually led A uascutum to seek a white knight. Liberty said yesterday that if a hostile bid were nevertheless to materialise, it was only nat- ural for it to seek the help of Seibu, the Japanese group with which it has had a long trading relationship. \"We've known them for a long time and if they were to come to us saying are you interested , our answer would probably be yes,\" he said. The Japanese group has been kept fully informed of the situation, Liberty said.",

   "text_content" : "SINIoftorFICIAL ra the the Royalhnk of Sc land admit that t.e ok a flyer when the bank stumied up Â£20m to help former ins ance broker, Mr Peter Wood, establish a new insurance sub- sidiary, Direct Line, in 19865. Mr Wood's concept of selling insurance on the basis of direct telephone response to carefully targeted medfa iaimpi4ns was revolutionary in a market where distribution has tradi- tionally been dominated by independent brokers. And Mr Wood's recipe for underwriting seemed ahead of its time. Using specially-devel- oped software programmes, the same telephonists would input into their computer terminals data based on customer's answers to a series of simple questions and offer instant insurance quotes. Yet six years on, Royal Bank's executives are enthusi- astic converts to direct response. Their subsidiary is the market leader in the grow- ing market for telesales. And with more and more British consumers becoming used to the idea of buying their insur- ance over the telephone and telephone-linked computer sales becoming more sophisti- cated, the-Royal Bank invest- ment looks farsighted. The bank's decision earlier this month to pump in an extra Â£24m into its rapidly growing subsidiary signals confidence in one of the few growth areas of the depressed British insur- ance industry. At a time when the tradi- tional composite companies like Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance are reporting record losses, Direct Line is making money, increasing its share of the market for motor and home insurance and gearing up for further growth. Direct Line's premium income is expected to be around Â£120m for the year to September 30, some 50 per cent more than in 1989-90. Profits in tk ito a rU moP-uto 8qp r 901 lebstthe iioup stil expecits tol that it the it could recoup its total invest- t to date of around r62m, three times over. one d within the indltiry, Direct Line isisits that the coatof distributintg nsurance bl mass media advertising and telesales is cheaper than by brhkers. Motor insurers pay commis- sions of between 10 and 20 per cent to brokers generating their business, while home buildings insurers can pay cominlssions of more than 30 per cent to the banks and building societies that domi- nate that corner of the market. By contrast Direct Line's only acquisition costs are incurred in its advertising campaigns, which amount to lesm than 10 per cent of pre- mium income, says Ms Jane Dickson, Direct Line's com- paniy secretary. The savings are particularly pronounced when taking into account year on year renewals of insurance policies. Brokers receive the same commission each time they renew a policy, but for Direct Line renewal costs are Moreover since brokers are duty bound to shop around on behalf of their customers, com- panies can end up losing cus- tomqrs relatively easily. AA Insurance services, one of the biggest broker chains, admit that broker generated business tends to be more volatile. Ms Dickson says at least four out of every five Direct Line motor policyholders renew their policy at the end of each year - compared to an indus- try-wide average nearer one in two. Chris McKee, a director at the Direct Line sales office in Croydon However, Direct Line places much more emphasis on the degree to which the telesales and computer-based underwrit- ing allow it more control than traditional insurance methods. Direct Line frequently charges above average rates for risks that it does not want - motor insurance in inner city areas, for example, effec- tively excluding much loss producing business from its books. \"If you are a direct writer you have a better idea of what risks you are writing,\" says Mr Chris Pountain, analyst with Morgan Stanley. Direct Line is able to \"cream\" the market, adds Mr Tom Bennett, an ana- lyst with Banque Paribas Capi- tal Markets. The company accepts pay- ment only by credit card or direct debit which allows it accordingly to employ far fewer accounting staff. Overall, Direct Line has been able to achieve underwriting results that are the envy of its bigger competitors. In the year to Sep- tember 30 its operating ratio (the yardstick that measures premium income against claims and expenses) was under 100 per cent, well below the industry average. Most companies compensate for underwriting losses with investment income. For Direct Line investment simply swells profits. Costs elsewhere are pared to a minimum. Labour organisa- tion is flexible and telephones are staffed in line with expec- ted demand. Many of Direct line's telephonists in Croydon work a week of three 12 hour days, for example, and the company's telephones are staffed from 8am to 8pm every day, in sharp contrast to many traditional insurance compa- nies which close their doors firmly at five o'clock in the afternoon. Direct Line is one of the few examples of a company where technology is being deployed in an effective way, says an exec- utive at the Royal Bank. \"It takes out a whole layer of mid- dle management. Data comes up through the organisation directly to senior management allowing the people at the top to drive the machine.\" But perhaps the clearest indication of the company's success is the way it has been spawning imitators. The most successful, Churchill, a subsid- iary of the Swiss insurance giant, Winterthur, is head- quartered at Bromley, only a few miles from Direct Line's Croydon headquarters. Churchill was set up by Mr Martin Long, who left Direct Line and persuaded Winter- thur to invest Â£30m in Chur- chill in 1989. The company, which operates in much the same way as Direct Line, claims a 2 per cent share of the UK motor insurance market, is planning annual growth of 100 per cent and expects to be in in the black by 1993. Three other insurers Royal Insurance, General Accident and Eagle Star have set up their own direct sales subsid- iaries (The Insurance Service, GA 121, and Eagle Star Direct) alongside existing sales via networks of brokers. Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, esti- mates that direct writers already write between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of the motor market. Mr John Ginar- lis, an analyst with PA Consul- tancy, reckons that the direct writers could account for as much as 50 per cent of all per- sonal lines insurance sales within five years."

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent MITSUBISHI Motors is to become the fifth Japanese car maker to establish a car assem- bly base in Europe. It signed a final agreement at the weekend to take a one- third stake in the Dutch car producer, Volvo Car, which hitherto has been owned 70 per cent by the Dutch state and 30 per cent by-Volvo of Sweden. The deal is the first Japanese car transplant project to be agreed since the European Community and Japan reached an accord at the end of July on Japanese car sales in the single European market. The backing of Renault, the majority French state-owned car maker, was crucial to the weekend's agreement. It has entered a strategic alliance with Volvo which gives both companies a veto on each other's deals with third parties. Th6 agreement also needed at least the tacit support of the French government, which holds an 80 per cent stake in Renault and which has been a fierce opponent of the expan- sion of the Japanese motor industry in Europe. Renault will supply the engines and transmissions for Volvo's part of the joint ven- ture production. Mitsubishi joins the ranks of Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Suzuki, which are all establish- ing car plants in Europe. The development of local produc- tion capacity will allow the car makers to increase rapidly their European market share. Volvo Car is to be re-named Ned Car. It will be owned one third by Mitsubishi Motors, one third by Volvo and one third by the Dutch state. As part of the agreement the Dutch government can sell its remaining stake to the two car makers in equal shares in 1998. Ned Car, which will begin operations by December 1, will build a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year at the Volvo Car plant at Born, with output beginning after 1995. It will continue to produce the Volvo 400 series. Volvo said the Ned Car proj- ect, which will include car design and development, engi- neering and production operations, could involve an investment of more than Fl3bn ($1.53bn). The new company will have an initial equity capital of F1550m. Mitsubishi Motors is to pay the Dutch state Fl220m for its one third stake and Volvo will pay Fl 20m to increase its 30 per cent stake to one third.",

   "text_content" : "By Emiko Terazono in Tokyo MOODY'S, the US credit-rating agency, has placed the long-term ratings of three Jap- anese banks - Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, Sanwa Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan - under review for pos- sible downgrades. The agency said it would review the banks' loan portfo- lios, namely their real-estate lending and other high-risk exposures. The move, which follows the recent downgrading of Indus- trial Bank of Japan and Norin- chukin, from Aaa ratings, reflects the problems which Japanese banks face after the era of easy credit of the late 1980s. The rating agency said that the poor profitability, vulnera- bility of asset quality and weak capital base of Mitsui Taiyo Kobe, currently rated at Aa3, had prompted its review. Mit- sui Taiyo Kobe's real-estate asset exposures and its lending policies and controls will be assessed. Moody's referred to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan's domestic and overseas asset quality, which has deteri- orated due to an increase in troubled property borrowers, and concerns over the effects of financial deregulation as reasons for the review of its Al rating. The agency, pointing to a deteriorating asset quality, added that Sanwa Bank's Aal ranking would be reviewed in the light of its loan underwrit- ing standards and internal con- trols.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Fostor in Hong Kong NEW LAWS come into force today in Hong Kong which force controlling shareholders and directors of listed compa- nies to make fuller disclosure of their shareholdings, and increase the penalties for insider dealing. The Securities (Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is based on legislation in the UK, forces any shareholder to dis- close a shareholding of 10 per cent or more, and every 1 per- centage point change. Compa- nies are allowed to make enquiries into the identity of shareholders and report find- ings to the regulators. The rules for directors and chief executives are more onerous. All share dealings have to reported and will be published by the stock exchange. Directors are also assumed to be interested in shares held by spouses and children. The law was passed in 1988 but has been delayed pending other changes. Its main impact is likely to be felt during con- tested takeovers and share- holder votes. \"If it works prop erly, it will change things quite drastically,\" according to Mr Stephen Clark, director of Anglo Chinese Corporate Finance. The legislation clarifies the definition of insider dealing and toughens the penalties for alfenders. They are liable to lose their profits or avoided losses and face fines of up to three times the amount They can also lose their right to hold directorships or manage companies for up to five years. *But the ordinance was watered down following com- plaints that it was too draco- nian. Insider dealing is still not classified as a criminal offence, although offenders who falsify testimony to the insider dealing tribunal face up to six months' Jail. 0 Hong Kong's Futures Exchange today introduces a p-perty contract based on the properties sub-index of the Hang Seo index. This is the second new contract to be lanched this year in a bid to rekindle Interest in the EMcaure. The contract is based on nine local property companies, including Cheung Kong and Hongkong Land. Property shares are among the most atvely trade in oang Ken d the nine compnies make up neary per cent o mar- ket caMaliation."

The company said that the economic slowdown in the US and most of Europe accounted for the higher than expected loss in the first half of 1991. In 1990 it made a group net profit of DM30m, its first posi- tive net result since 1986 when extraordinary items allowed it to post a group net profit of DM28.6m. The group said sales in the second half of the year were expected to surpass those in the first half, when they fell 2 per cent against 1990 to DM1.83bn. KHD's optimism is based on the expectation that delayed orders would take effect in the second half of the year, and there would be a strong domes- tic economy, an increase in orders from the Gulf region and Algeria, and export mar- kets would improve.",

The funds will be used to strengthen the capital base of its foreign branches, and to re- open some of the 1,400 domes- tic branches closed this year by former president Mr Alberto Policaro. The branches were shut due to unprofitability. The bank also announced a first-half net profit of Cr47.4bn or $10Bm at today's exchange rates, a fall of 28.05 per cent in real terms on the same period last year. Dividends were reduced to Cr5.40 from Cr5.65. A long and crippling strike at the bank during the period was blamed for the profits fall. The rights issue will offer a mix of voting and non-voting shares. The federal govern- ment, which controls 51 per cent of votes in the group, will purchase $115m of the new shares while existing share- holders will have first option on the rest. Remaining shares will be floated on the country's stock exchanges. The rights issue has to be approved by the federal gov- ernment. In addition to the issue, the bank said it would make a four-for-one stock split.

   "text_content" : "GILT prices were buoyed last week by reports from two lead- ing groups of fnancial experts that nflationary pressures in the UK during the next year would be minimal. With a strong performance in the US bond market, where prices rose steadily, the com- ments from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research ensured that the gilt market continued its rally of the past two months. Since the end of June, yields of most gilt-edged securities have declined by between 30 and 60 basis points (between 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points), with the largest decreases apparent for longer-dated bonds. Last week, the trend continued, with yields being pushed down fractionally along the yield curve. In its annual review of the UK economy, the OECD was bullish about prospects for low inflation and falling wage claims over the next year. \"The settings of fUK] policy are now consistent with steady disinfla- tion,\" it said, repeating the Treasury's forecast that the yearly rate of retail price inflation is likely to fall steadily, to about 4 per cent by the end of this year. \"Th report from the National Institute followed the OCD' line that the UK inflationpic- ture was being helped b the disciplining effects of stering's entry last October into the European exchange rate mech- anism. If anything, its message had a bigger mpact on eco- nomic observers - given that the institute is an independent body, while the wording of the OECD's report wasnfluenced by Treasury offcdals, who were allowed to review early drafts. \"In the medium term there is less prospect of renewed growth in unit costs [across the economy] due to the disci- plines exerted by membership of the ERM,\" the report said. \"Wage bargainers and price setters are likely to realise that any cost or price escalation will not automatically be vall- dated by exchange rate depre- ciation.\" Both organisations also underlined the general consen- sus among economic observers that the UK recession was probably near to its end, but that no sudden upturn wat likely. Also, the recovery would be muted. \"Overall real gross domestic product growth until end-1992 is projected to remain, below the growth of Rsssd at p r(%) productive potential,\" the OECD said. Words like this are music to the ears of bond traders, on the grounds that slow economic expansion will restrain any rise in inflationary pressures, and should lead to lower inter- est rates. The gilt market last week was also cheered by falling yields in other bond markets, such as in Germany and the US. This is due to expectations that'the world economy gener- ally is in for sluggish growth over the next year or so, with a slowdown expected in Ger- many, and the extent of the recoyvy ir Wthe I in some doubt. At the moment the uimid ola bondienMmdly place,\" said one gilt .pecalist. Worries about a surge in gilt isuewhihlchcould push down -pi receded into the back- groad last week. There was general relief that the Bank of England failed to announce a new tranche of bond issues last Friday, as had been widely Neither did the Bank announce the date for the next gilt auction - widely antici- pated for this month. The volume of new issues will be linked to the size ofthe overshoot on the 1991-2 public sector borrowing requirement, which the Treasury projects at -20bn ($134bn) but is likely to be t2bn4bn grieater Given the influence of the Treasury in drawing up the OECD report, the dry sentence in the study that \"there are risks of a somewhat larger defi- cit than projected\" amounts to the first ofical indication that the government is revising its target for this number. How- ever, this hardly worried the gilt market, in that it said nothing which was not known already. Peter Marsh",

   "text_content" : "FOREIGN investors are showing a keen interest in Danish government bonds, attracted by high yields and a positive assessment of the Dan- ish economy. Dealers expect last week's surge in buying by foreign and domestic investors to continue, given the stable market condi- tions and the fact that no fur- ther interest rate increases are expected. Traders said most activity last week was concentrated in the benchmark Treasury 9 per cent due 2000, the largest gov- ernment bond issue in Den- mark. The issue \"is very popular: it fits in well with investors' port- folios as it is one of the most compatible with the British market and the US Treasury series,\" said Ms Mette Kirke- terpe, an analyst at Bikuben Bors. It yielded 9.23 per cent at Thursday's close, compared with 9.28 per cent a week ago and 9.45 per cent a month ago. The yield spread over the com- parable German government bond is now about 80 basis points. \"The spread should narrow to 50 basis points: earlier in the year this was expected to hap- pen around the close of 1991 but now it looks as if the nar- rowing will not take place until the spring of next year,\" said Mr Birger Durhuus, ana- lyst at Danske Bors. Danish interest rates were raised last month following the increase in the German Lom- bard rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent. The Danish National Bank was forced to push up key interest rates by half a point to relieve pressure on the Danish krone, which has been scrap- ing the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Analysts expect the extra quarter point increase over the German levels to have a posi- tive, stabilising impact on the bond market, since no more increases are expected from the National Bank in the near future, even if the Bundesbank decides to push up interest rates further. Since 1990 the Danes have boasted the lowest inflation rates in the European Commx- nity and the trend is expected to continue, with the average increase in consumer prices for 1991 projected at 2.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the govern- ment's 1992 budget, released last week, had surprisingly lit- tle impact on the bond market, in spite of a proposed DKr30O.5bn ($.6bn) deficit. The budget projects spending at DKr326.2bn, which includes interest payments of DKr57.9bn on state debt of DKr560.4bn. But because of the weak posi- tion of the minority right-wing coalition government, the mar- ket has been indifferent to the budget. \"The main conclusion is that the budget says absolutely nothing,\" complained Mr Dur- huus. Radical changes are not expected until the budget is finally debated with the main Social Democrat opposition party and small centre-right parties, with negotiations expected to last at least until the end of the year. However, market assessment of the economy is favourable because of the current account and foreign trade surpluses, and an estimated growth in gross domestic product of 2 per cent for 1991 and a projeted rise to 2.25 per cent for largely coming from increases in exports.

Much of the US credit market thinks so, and that the A elease this coming Friday of the latest employ- mept, statistics could be the tr eemployment report is a closely watched indicator of monthly economic activity, and this week's figures will firmly point to the strength of the economy in August. Wall Street is expecting a small increase in non-farm payroll numbers, of between so,ooo0.000 and 50,000 jobs, partly offsetting declines during the months of June and July. Numbers of this order would support the view that the econ- omy is growing modestly. The larger question is whether that growth is suffi- ciently strong to be self-sus- taining, or whether the Fed will want to cut interest rates during the next few weeks to reduce the chances of a slip into a\" double dip\" recession. The strong rally in the US government bond market dur- ing the past few weeks, with rallies in international markets such as Japan, have given the Fed much greater latitude to ease. Last week the yield on the benchmark US 30-year long bond, which hovered around 8.5 per cent for much of the summer, dipped temporarily through the 8 per cent barrier. The market is coming increas- ingly to accept that the econ- omy's prospective growth rate is unlikely to reignite inflation.

A downward revision to sec- ond-quarter GNP, showing con- traction at an annual rate of 0.1 per cent instead of the 0.4 per cent increase estimated earlier, was largely of historic interest. However, the change was due partly to -stronger than expected inventory liquidation, and the fact that an aggressive run-down of stocks has extended into a third quarter bodes well for GNP growth in the July to September period, as industry rebuilds its inven- tory in anticipation of stronger consumer demand. That was underlined by Fri- day's figures for July leading indicators - the strongest rise .in three years, the improve- ment mainly concentrated in the manufacturing sector - and by an early indicator for August, the Chicago area pur- chasing managers' report, which showed surprising strength. But it remains moot whether consumers will feel sufficiently well off to buy the goods that will sustain the inventory rebuild into the fourth quarter. Last week brought figures showing an 8.5 per cent drop in new home sales in July and a 0.1 per cent decline in personal income (the latter possibly a statistical aberration), while car sales in the first 20 days of August were below July's level Money supply growth, which the Fed has been watching extremely closely, also remains troubling, with M2 growing at the bottom of the Fed's 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. Much of that may be due to shifts in investors' portfolios to instru- ments with more attractive returns. However, Mr Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond'and someone who has in the past seemed sanguine about the monetary aggregates, said last week that he would favour fur- ther easing in the weeks ahead if M2 growth did not acceler- ate; The market, then, expects the Fed to ease in September - even if this week's employ- ment figures are not the trig- ger - bringing the discount rate down to 5 per cent, with Fed funds dipping from 5.5 to 5.25 per cent. Long bond yields might then drop convincingly through the 8 per cent barrier. Last week's government bond rally - which ended up with a '/ point gain in the 30- year issue, despite Friday's more bullish economic news - was helped by strong demand at the Treasury's auction of two and five-year notes, the first such sale since the scan- dal over Salomon's rigging of past auctions broke in early August. Salomon, the largest player in the Treasury market, has been barred from placing bids for customers in auctions, although it can bid for itself. And a wide-ranging investiga- tion by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible collusion in the mar- ket discouraged many trading houses from the kind of price discussions ahead of the bid- ding which normally allow them to get a feel for the strength of demand. All this had raised fears that the auction would be sloppily bid, with wide spreads between the high, low and average yields, and that demand might be below average. But in the event it went off smoothly. Martin Dickson",

   "text_content" : "THE REPUBLIC of Cyprus was given a warm welcome back to the syndicated loans market last week, as it mandated banks to raise money for it for the first time since 1988. Then, it had been a term loan arranged by Chase Man- hattan. This time, the govern- ment of Cyprus is seeking a $120m standby facility to back its recently increased Euro- commercial paper programme. This programme, not previ- ously backed by a standby credit, was increased last month from $100m to $200m. Cyprus's standing was con- firmed recently when its com- mercial paper was assigned the top Al+ from rating agency Standard & Poor's (it already carried Prime 1 from Moody's). However, some rivals won- dered why it is taking seven banks - Arab Banking Corpo- ration, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo, Gulf International Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, WestLB Group and Giro- zentrale Vienna - to bring a $120m facility. Could using such a wide spread of banks be a sign-that Cyprus is not as well thought of after all? No, argued the underwriters. With Cyprus being an infre- quent visitor to the capital markets, banks generally did not have significant exposure limits against which to lend. That left the need to spread the underwriting more widely than would otherwise have been the case, they said. The standby is being brought at a margin over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) of 65 basis points, with a commitment fee of 35 basis points.

As such, banks lending to the republic would have to take a full capital hit under Bank for International Settle- ment rules (with a 50 per cent capital weighting for commit- ted but undrawn facilities). The Cyprus mandate came among mixed reports from banks of the volume of syndi- cated loans likely soon. Several reported interest at its highest for some time, fore- shadowing a succession of deals later in the year. Others, though, said interest in bank finance remained sporadic as the bond and equity markets continued to provide the pre- ferred routes to capital. The continuing popularity of bilat- eral (or one-on-one) deals, rather than syndicated, also suggested that most syndicate desks would remain quiet for some time. The latest series of large bilateral deals came from Norsk Hydro, which announced on Friday it had arranged $950m of standby credits through bilateral agree- ments with 20 banks. . Norsk Hydro did not disclose terms for the credits, which were concluded at differing rates, though it said the seven-year agreements had similar struc- ture. Although such bilateral deals have dominated bank lending recently, there is still a trickle of syndicated loans. The latest is a $175m, fully underwritten term-loan and revolving credit facility for Kvaerner, the Norwegian ship- ping, shipbuilding and engi- neering group. Both the six-year, $100m term loan and five-year, $75m revolving credit have been keenly priced at 50 basis points over Libor for the first three years, rising to 55 basis points afterwards. Commitment and front-end fees for the deal, jointly man- aged by Banque Indosuez, Den norske Bank and SE Banken Capital Markets, were not dis- closed. Richard Waters",

   "text_content" : "THE RALLY in US and European government bond markets last week has raised hopes that the seasonal revival of activity in the Eurobond market at the start of Septein- ber will produce a burst of new issues. Market conditions and eco- nomic fundamentals are both favourable. However, it is not yet clear whether borrowers, many of which have already fulfilled most of their funding needs for this year, will take the opportunity to fund ahead of further requirements. A number of benchmark deals are already scheduled for September. The World Bank is expected to launch its next global bond offering, which will total more than $lbn, at the end of September, and the European Investment Bank is considering issues in both Ecus and dollars. In the Euroyen market, where Japan Development Bank's Y100bn deal in August has revived interest in the sec- tor, a further benchmark issue is expected this week. Nippon Telegraph & Telephone is pre- paring a Y50bn deal, expected to have a life of 10 years. Daiwa Europe is tipped to win the mandate to arrange the deal. Meanwhile, the European Bank for .; construction and Development is preparing to launch its debut Issue. The EBRD is close to completing its selection process and is exec- ted tq appoint a lead bank this week. The EBRD is keen that its first transaction in the Euro- bond market should be denom- inated in Ecus, and has been encouraged by the recent improvement in tone in the sector, after a rather dismal summer. Politically, it seems unlikely that the bank would eschew the Ecu market. But the bank is keeping its options open, and is prepared to switch to the dollar market, if the Ecu sector proves unfa- vourable. Consequently, the EBRD will award the mandate to one of a limited group of banks capable of arranging a deal in both Ecus and dollars. The size of the issue will be Ecu3OOm- EcuSOOm, or $300m-$500m, and will have a maturity of five to 10 years. An Ecu deal would be swapped into floating-rate Ecus, and held in short-term liquid instruments pending dis- bursement. The bank would hope to derive some positive carry from the inverted yield curve in the Ecu market (that is, earn a margin between the US 30 year trIiiur Vbonds yield % 8 20 8.15 8.10 8.06 8.00 7.95 SuWinxs rJgugg vIwi short-term rates at which funds are held and the long-term rate at which fund- ing had been secured). But the dollar and sterling sectors are the most likely to experience a rush of activity, as the recent strength in both markets has pushed rates close to companies' targets. Last week, the US long bond yield fell through 8 per cent, a psychological level and a trig- ger-point for several borrowers. However, most analysts expect the yield on the long bond to continue down towards 7% per cent, so some borrowers may still be inclined to wait a little longer. However, yield spreads of Eurodollar bonds, relative to the US Treasury market, are lower than for several years. Historic lows reached in the mid-1980s, when some corpo- rate bonds traded at lower yields than US Treasuries, are still some way off. But those levels are unlikely to return, as the market has become more liquid and more institutionally- based in recent years. Borrow- ers may decide it is wise to take advantage of current absolute funding levels. However, it is not certain that US companies will come to the Eurobond market, in preference to the US domestic market. In particular, the most v sought-after triple-A names are 1' able to fund more cheaply in n the US than in the Eurobond hi market. The dollar market looks d increasingly attractive comr- I pared with other currency sec- tors, with absolute rates now ii as low as in any other cur- ii rency sector, apart from yen. t] However, there is a danger o that from a retail investor's te point of view, despite contin- e ued bullish sentiment on the a dollar market, coupons on dol- e lar bonds may soon appear ti unacceptably low. Swiss and a German retail investors are li well known for their prefer- y ence for high coupons, which a has led them to buy foreign bonds. With comparable cou- g pons now on offer on German c government bonds and even a Swiss franc bonds, investors ft may prefer to avoid foreign tl currency exposure. In the sterling market, too, t companies' targets are back in i view. Gilts maturing in five years or more are now yielding 14 below 10 per cent, another key s number, back to levels last tj seen early this year. D But Eurobond yield spreads r have tightened dramatically - k as much as 30 basis points - tj since then, so that absolute funding levels are back to where they were at the end of 1909. Then, many UK compa- nies put off borrowing, expect- ing rates to fall further, and were disappointed. They may decide to strike while the iron is hot this time. But the market has changed in the last two years. Most importantly, the UK has joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem, highlighting the issue of economic convergence. This means that many borrowers expect rates to fall substan- tially in the longer term, so are much less willing to lock in long-dated funds of, say, 20 years (unless they need to match-fund long assets). Borrowers tend to have tar- gets of 11 per cent and 11% per cent for long-dated maturities and 10% per cent or 11 per cent for shorter maturities. But these may be revised down- wards, on the assumption that UK interest rates are set to fall further soon. Dealers say that the strong level of investor demand for sterling bonds, boosted by con- tinental European interest, means that the range of bor- rowers able to access the mar- ket is broader than for some time.

   "text_content" : "IT WILL be a week for watching the US economy for signs of recovery after last week's surprise gross national product data, which showed that the economy continued to shrink in the second quarter. Nonetheless, some analysts maintain that growth will return so strongly in the sec- ond half that the Federal Reserve will have to move interest rates up. Last week's gross national product figures were depressed by oil imports, while restock- ing and export growth would fuel the recovery. However, there is still some suggestion that the conflicting signs of a relatively weak US economy will force the Federal Reserve into one more easing - especially since the dollar, and long-term bond yields have shown stability in the after- math of the failed coup in the Soviet Union. In Japan, there are also sug- gestions that there might be a further cut in the official dis- count rate (ODR) some time this month, in the light of the delicate state of the stock mar- ket and other financial sectors. The Tankan survey on Friday will shed light on the current state of business confidence and capital spending plans.

   "text_content" : "ATTITUDES TOWARDS the D-Mark are as cautious as the west's attitude towards the changes that have come about in the Soviet Union. In fact the future performance of the D-Mark is now seen to be closely linked with the for- tunes of the Soviet republics and their peaceful transition to democracy. Whether the union holds together is not so UK lurig h l6M ding ruts 11 rP sat rm uly 12, 131 important, but a drift into anarchy and civil war would have significant consequences. There has always been a risk premium in holding D-Marks, even when the Soviet Union appeared to be powerful and stable. Germany was in the front line in the event of hostilities breaking out between Nato and the Warsaw pact. If the Soviet move towards democracy continues peacefully this threat will all but disappear, even though ownership of the Soviet arsenal may become a problem. The easing of tension should therefore encourage funds to move into Germany, but the financial markets have not yet shown any great enthusiasm for the D-Mark. This contrasts with reaction to the dollar, where a sharp rise in an erratic figure such as US durable goods orders can send the currency soaring. Evidence of US economic recovery is at best tenuous, but If this month's US data are good the dollar may attack the year's high of DM1.8430 touched on July 12. Provisional consumer prices in the old country of West Germany indicated a fall in August year-on-year inflation to 4.1 from 4.4 per cent, compared with the US level of 4.4 per cent in July. At the same time German interest rates are about 3.5 percentage points higher than comparable US rates. If the political risk of holding D-Marks has diminished the market seems rather slow to take advantage of this attractive premium.

   "text_content" : "Dr Manmohan Singh, India's minister of finance, speaks to David Housego and Alexander Nicoll If the long-overdue reforms on which India has embarked do succeed in turning around the par- lous state of the economy, much of the credit will go to Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance. India faces a $6bn current account deficit this financial year (after a $10bn deficit last year) at a time when its foreign exchange reserves are virtually exhausted and when it is hav- ing acute difficulty in borrow- ing on the international com- mercial market. The new government has cut the fiscal deficit and embarked on a pol- icy of industrial and trade der- egulation designed to improve competitiveness. The task ahead is indeed enormous. Dr Singh, a cautious bureaucrat who has held most of the senior economic posts in the Indian administration before being unexpectedly pitchforked into his current job, is only too aware of the many pitfalls that lie ahead and of the risks of stumbling. \"There is no doubt in my mind that the reform process has acquired a momentum of its own. It will be difficult to reverse,\" he says. \"This is not to say it is going to be smooth. There are many risks and dan- gers. I hope the international community will recognise that changing direction in an open society like ours is not a risk- free enterprise.\" A softly spoken Sikh, Dr Singh has served as governor of the Reserve Bank of India (central bank), chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance, and most recently as a special adviser to the former prime minister, Mr Chandra Shekhar. In the 1970s he was thus associated with implementing the type of socialist policies he is now seeking to reverse. At the time, he told friends that in a country with widespread pov- erty such as India governments were inevitably leftist. By the. mid-1980s he was already pressing for an open- ing-up of the economy. What really seems to have changed his outlook, however, was his becoming secretary-general of the South Commission in 1987, when he visited South Korea and Taiwan. He was much struck by the pace of economic growth under export-oriented policies. Though he now has a clear vision himself of where he wants India to go, he is also a pragmatist in adapting to the political pressures of the moment. In his first press conferences as finance minister, he cited the example of South Korea's internationally competitive industry - a reference that had until then been taboo in the mouths of government ministers. His change of heart was reflected in a speech earlier this year before taking office, when he said on returning from his Geneva-based post in November 1990, that he found \"a growing feeling of scepti- cism, self-doubt and even of despondency\" in the national mood. He told a university audience in Bangalore, in southern India, that \"the laxity in recent years in dealing with India's fiscal and balance of payments problems and a fail- ure to press ahead with long- overdue structural reforms\" had also contributed to the mood of despondency. But the speech equally showed that he was no radical reformer storming the barri- cades. \"A well thought-out plan has to be devised to make the rupee a convertible cur- rency in a reasonable period of time, in any case before the end of the decade,\" he said. Dr Singh had retired to the backwaters of the University Grants Commission when Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao unexpectedly plucked him out - to his obvious delight - to become finance minister after the Congress party won the general election in June. Once in office, he acted rapidly to devalue the rupee by 18 per cent to halt speculation against the currency, which had been hit by capital flight. The gov- ernment's sales of gold stocks were an admission that the for- eign exchange reserves were nearly exhausted. In July he unveiled a budget that cut the fiscal deficit from 9 per cent of gross domestic product the previous year to 6.5 per cent. Parallel with this, the government embarked on a programme of industrial and trade deregulation. Quiet and self-deprecating, Dr Singh has an unquestioned reputation for honesty. He finds it difficult to dodge a direct question. When pushed to be specific on something he is reluctant to disclose, he falls back on the implausible \"I have no head for figures.\" Friends say his responsibility in navigating the reform pack- age through cabinet and parlia- ment imposes on him a huge load. \"It is not a job I would wish on a friend,\" says one. His enthusiasm for reform does not mean that he thinks that the market alone is the 'The market will not take care ot an our prooiems I I I I rÂ·:.; \"Â·'~;'Â·`; ; ' `i~Â·-Â·i answer to India's problems. \"We can't assume that the market will take care of all our problems. There are millions outside the market who live on the edge of subsistence. They cannot be dealt with through the market mechanism.\" The strength of the appoint- ment is that Dr Singh is a respected figure among inter- national bankers and financial institutions on whom India depends to stave off default. He PERSONAL FILE 1932 Born Gah, Punjab, in what is now Pakistan. 1956 Awarded Adam Smith prize at Cambridge. 1972 Economic adviser, Min- istry of Finance. 1982 Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (the cen- tral bank). 1987 Secretary general of the South Commission. 1990 Economic adviser to the prime minister. 1991 Finance minister. also knows that what India has embarked on is a readjustment programme that will last from three to five years and that the hardest part in many ways is yet to come - deeper cuts in public expenditure, opening industry up to competition through steep tariff reductions, reducing the labour force in public-sector industries and the banks, and allowing multi- nationals a freedom to operate in India that has so far been denied them. So daunting are the tasks ahead that many colleagues in cabinet and Congress have no idea of where the road of reform will take them and lit- tle stomach for the fight. Dr Singh's weakness is that he has a tendency to succumb to pressure and has no experi- ence of the bear-pit of Indian politics. He partially gave way to farmers' lobbying against the cut in fertiliser subsidies announced in his budget. Will he \"cave in\" as well to lobby- ing by industrialists against the wealth tax also imposed in the budget? \"No comment,\" he says. But he adds - suggesting that he might lend an ear to their grievances - that \"I am sympathetic to all segments of the economy who actively par- ticipate in the creation of national wealth.\" His other problem is that he is part of a government that is itself a minority administra- tion and is riddled with dissen- sion. It is to offset these factors and to provide a guarantee of the continuity of reform that he is keen that India should seek a further loan from the International Monetary Fund under its Extended Fund Facil- ity - which could provide India with $5bn-$7bn over three years. \"There is no doubt in our mind that we shall have to go for this [EFF loan],\" he says. \"But asking for it is one thing. The Fund accepting it is a different thing. So I am not in a position to say there will be an agreement.\" Dr Singh is aware of appre- hensions that the greatest threat to his policies comes from the risk of devaluation and import shortages precipit- ating an inflationary spiral that could be tough to control. Elsewhere, he is under pres- sure from the World Bank and the IMF to hasten tariff cuts. India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world, with an average weighted tariff of 112 per cent. Industrialists are also holding off invest- ments until they know the extent of the tariff cuts. The finance minister says he will reveal his medium-term target for tariff cuts in the next budget due in March next year. Then, he will also need to start offsetting the loss of customs revenues by increasing direct taxes or excise duties. \"I know what I want to do. At the end, we will have tariff rates providing a reasonable level of protection which do not constitute an unreasonable barrier to foreign competition.\" He said he would like to shift the loss of customs duties to direct taxes, but says there are \"obvious administrative prob- lems.\" Broadening the income tax base to include farmers would, for instance, provoke a political outcry. Politicians in Delhi feel that, as a technocrat with no party base, he will be sacrificed if the reforms run into trouble, or inflation - currently exceed- ing 13 per cent on the con- sumer price index - rose much higher. He says himself that being a technocrat, rather than a politician, has had some \"short-term advantages\". As to the possibility of his being made a scapegoat for the unpo- pularity of the measures and high inflation, Dr Singh shrugs his shoulders and smiles - adding that in a democracy nobody is indispensable."

   "text_content" : "JUSTINIAN ver since President Mik- hail Gorbachev prom- ised three years ago that the Soviet Union would become a state based on the rule of law, commentators have sought to identify the potential hurdles that would stand in the way of a planned evolution towards such a civi- lised system of law. With the sudden demise of the Commu- nist party, will the long-stand- ing bureaucratic stranglehold of the state apparatus over the courts be finally loosened? Will an unplanned replacement carry the seeds of an imperfect system? The main focus of reform of the Soviet legal system has been on the independence of the judiciary and the reality of a fair trial. Amendments to the Criminal Law were issued in 19s9. One amendment, Article 7, made it a criminal offence to call for the overthrow or change of the Soviet state or system. The supreme soviet reflected the liberal approach by making it a crime only to call for a \"violent\" overthrow of the state or system. It wil be under this provision that the 14 main participants in the abortive coup of August 19 will be prosecuted. In July 1989, the supreme court presented to the supreme soviet draft laws on the judi- cial system and the status of judges. The first enshrined for the first time in Soviet history the presumption of laNmIIMC. Sine then, dort have bee made to stop the Minitry of Justice fom meddlg in cort cases. The presumption of ineuence is less a questi of dispute between the legal t- session and the prosecuting authorities, and more a strg- gle between the poueiosb who believe in the automm'y of institutions and party bureaucrats keen to retain keep control over institutions. F The trial of the 14 will be a i test of whether the old order r has indeed been replaced by an r independent and impartial trial system. Whereas in the past foreign observers were not per- mitted to attend the trials of dissidents, lawyers from abroad will now, no doubt, be attending to evaluate the new legal order. However, the old k attitude of Soviet judges who Swere hostile to an accused in r obedience to secret party direc- I tives could too readily be t replaced by a long-standing Sprejudice against those who I commit crimes, particularly against the state.

At its p r it was explained that this I deame reIaed to \"delberate . publc circulatio of slander Saur o au in that are obv SThe Coogress of People's r Deputies subsequently approved a proposal to abolish this article. However, the article was deployed by the public prosecutor last year, and the outcome of the case made refreshing reading to those who looked for signs that the political abuse of psychia- try has really been abandoned. A well-known, eccentric lady had paraded publicly a placard denouncing Mr Gorbachev. When she was arrested and brought to trial, the court remanded her for psychiatric assessment to the Kashenko hospital in Moscow. Within a week, the doctors declared her mentally healthy and she was immediately released. Her case, however, exemplified other worries about how far the old-style political abuse of psychiatry has disappeared. For more than 20 years, the Soviet Union had been engaged in the practice of confining political and religious dissi- dents in psychiatric hospitals for non-medical reasons. All such dissidents have now been released, but little seems to have been done to rehabilitate them in civil society. If the victims of pychiatric abuse are being helped then it has been proceeding at a small's pace. 'e icial regis- ter ofat mentally diadered w sos remains w its earlier deective reordings. Te dissi- dent lady, for example had been several a -e - *hm sed not by active pychisea, but rate by asthiom a of pes ality.

A ewMiretal the iwh- been puocgdiar thoughu the SovAit gitenr- mdhi el is generally in line with psychi- atric practices in the west. It is a big advance and would out- law any political abuse of psy- chiatry. But the abandonment of the political abuse of psychi- atry is attributable to changes in policy and pending law, rather than in changes of psy- chiatry. In response to a visiting dele- gation of US psychiatrists and forensic experts in 1989, Soviet psychiatrists explained that \"in Soviet medical practice in general, not only in psychiatry, it is not customary to discuss with patients the methods of treatment, except in cases where the patient is a physi- cian\". The new draft mental health law does not at present enact the concept of informed consent before a patient can be given medication. Foreign observers' concern about the workings of Soviet law in relation to .dicaped individuals has switched psychiatry to narcology. The authorities seem to be still using the system of taking 'incorrigible\" alcoholics to pe- ventive work-camps, even though they have not been sen- ntnced by the courts. These people languish untreated for two to three years in poor physical surromdings. Such spec pmlms os an emerging leal order that mReetIs undamenal fseedoms and human rights pale into <insigni ageart the over- ridig needor a new constit- tko. th frriatnoes between the reubics and the centre re setled asicbly, thee i littl prospect that ordinary laws wil fll naturally iato place a state goveed under ihe a e of elaw."

   "text_content" : "LETTER FROM JERUSALEM r Rahamim Israelov and his wife Lud- milla are among the lucky ones. They emigrated to Israel from the Soviet city of Samarkand a year ago, leaving behind their comfortable house because they feared that pogroms and ethnic violence would be the inevitable result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Now they run a small but thriving grocery store in Jerusalem. But even they have not found their new life in the Jew- ish state to be all they expec- ted. He was a dentist and she a piano teacher, but they ini- tially had to take jobs in a supermarket and in the build- ing industry. With a total monthly income of 1,700 shek- els (Â£453), and a rent bill of Shl,200, they could hardly sur- vive. Mr Israelov's sister and the Jewish Agency, which organises immigration to Israel, put up capital for the shop. It is doing well, but gro- cery is not their trade. \"What can I do, dear?\" asks Mrs Israelov as a drunken Pol- ish Jew wanders in to buy a bottle of vodka. \"We have three children and they need to eat. There's no choice.\" The Israelovs' problems highlight the increasing diffi- culties besetting the hundreds of thousands of Jews who are streaming into Israel from the rickety Soviet empire. For more than 18 months, thanks to relaxed Soviet emigration controls, planeloads of them have been arriving in the Jew- ish state almost by the day. Some 300,000 have arrived since 1989, and Israel is trying to encourage the more than 1m Jews still in the Soviet Union to come to join them. But even if more do come, few are likely to find life easy in the Promised Land. Instead, they will encounter severe unemployment, housing short- ages and widespread disillu- sion among both the immi- grants and their Israeli hosts. Thanks to economic hardship, what is already one of the larg- est migrations in history has turned distinctly sour. It is difficult for outsiders to comprehend the political and emotional significance attached by Israel, and indeed by its Arab enemies, to the aliya (Hebrew for ascent) of so many olmn (immigrants). After absorbing 170,000 Soviet Jews in the 1970s, Israel is expecting the latest exodus to yield as many as 1.5m, com- pared with an Israeli popula- tion of only about 4.7m. Mr Nathan Sharansky, the Soviet Jewish dissident, has called it \"a monumental wave of people, an entire civilisation saved, an epic opportunity grasped\". Yet, for the time being, a third of the immigrants are without work, and most of those with jobs are not practis- ing their chosen professions. A few have turned to prostitu- tion, others to begging. Busk- ers playing violins or singing opera jostle for space among the open-air cafes on Jerusa- lem's Ben Yehuda St. The common Jewish heri- tage of the immigrants and their Israeli hosts has barely disguised a feeling of mutual resentment. Soviet Jews often complain of harsh treatment (\"They only want us to clean their houses,\" says Mrs Israe- lov), while longstanding resi- dents of Israel accuse the new- comers of whining, spongeing and arrogance. Hadashot, a Hebrew newspa- per, recently interviewed resi- dents of Yad-Ellyahu, a poor Tel Aviv suburb inhabited mainly by Sephardi Jews of North African or Asian origin, and published some startling remarks. \"We've been treated like los- ers for too many generations to allow some stinking Russian to come and join the Ashkenazlm (European Jews) in looking down on us,\" said Mr Navon Sumbul. \"I can't stand Rus- sians,\" added Mr Eren Mer- havi. \"Sons of bitches, mani- acs, they should have left them there. I don't want to look at their white faces, their delicate hands; they bug me.\" Such anti-immigrant senti- ments are not unique to Israel, but if the scale of the aliya enterprise is staggering, so are the concomitant risks. As Mr Sharansky points out, if the US were to absorb a proportion- ately similar number of immi- grants its annual quota would be not 110,000 but 15m. Israeli families, he says, have eagerly adopted immi- grants, helping them to learn Hebrew and to cope with life in Israel. In return they receive a psychological boost. \"There is such a big army of volunteers; the reason is that after many years of disappointment, sud- denly Israelis see that Israel is becoming an attraction for Jews. Suddenly they see that they were right to be living here, building it, defending it.\" Not all Soviet immigrants live in the miserable mobile homes on the outskirts of Beer- sheba which have been so cas- tigated in the Israeli press. Mr Mikhail Pastov, for example, emigrated from Tashkent to Qazrin on the Golan Heights, the plateau in the north which Syria lost in the 1967 war. He helps the local council to absorb more Soviet Jews while his wife undergoes retraining so that she can practise medi- cine in Israel. \"I've been here for a year and a half,\" he says contentedly. \"I have an apart- ment with everything inside - TV, furniture - and I have a new car. And today I'm going on vacation to Russia.\" The only cloud on his hori- zon is the prospect of losing his Golan home if the heights are returned to Syria under a Mid- dle East peace agreement. It is common to hear Rus- sian spoken these days on the streets of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Kiryat Shmona. Israelis hope that if the pedestrians stop speaking Russian, it is because the immigrants have learned Hebrew, but it may be because they have gone away again. The number of Soviet Jews requesting Israeli pass- ports is rising sharply, prompt- ing fears at the Jewish Agency that thousands are planning to leave and not come back. Victor Mallet",
