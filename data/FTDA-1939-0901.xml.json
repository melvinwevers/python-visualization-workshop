More exciting conditions returned to the various sections of the Money market to-day, sentiment being affected by the various developments in connection with the crisis, includ- ing among which were the complete mobilisation of the Navy and the decision to evacuate children. In the foreign exchanges, sterling opened easier, staged a recovery and then relapsed afresh as the various items of news were released. Turnover in the bullion market was again moderate and there was more arbitrage business, but in Lombard Street credit conditions were less comfortable. Changes in the Bank Return were of considerable interest. The active note circulation increased more than Â£21,000,000 to the fresh high record for all time of Â£529,498,805. The effect of this efflux on the credit base was more than offset by the revaluation of the gold stock to the tune of Â£16.6 millions and the acquisition of Government securities to the extent of Â£13.5 millions. Nevertheless, bankers' balances or market resources were about Â£2,000,000 down owing to an immobilisation of funds in public deposits. Larger payments for Treasury bills and some calling by the banks led to a keener demand for accommodation, but advances were available at 3 per cent. against bills and at 3%-3y% per cent. against bonds. The position improved before the close. Discount rates became firmer in tendency and the three months bank draft was but little below Bank Rate at 3'*',. per cent. There was a certain amount of buying of November bills at 3% per cent. LoA. DIsCOUU.T PEs CjsTr. PER CEST. Ank Bils FineTradeBills Day- Short 2 3 4 6 3 1 6 to-day periods mth.s. . mths. mths.

DEARER DOLLARS French Francs Kept Steady Against Sterling As indicated above, sterling was dominated by political events, and, as these were considered unfavourable, the tendency was adverse to London. Dollars were in demand on Continental account and gained 11 cents on balsnce at $4.28%. Canadian dollars were 7 cents dearer at $4.38. Among Continental currencies, French francs were again held by the control at 175%, but Dutch guilders appreciated to 7.99%. Foreign and other Exchange Rates Page Six",

Announcement of the Government's evacuation plan and the closing of the Stock Exchange during the carrying out of the scheme led to a decline in activity and in prices. Markets generally had opened dull, but a recovery was in progress when the announcement was made. Subse- quent dealing consisted largely of the evening-up of books before the closure. Recent improvement in British Funds received- a severe' '-cWe.'lt'Pnt fluctuated, and closed lower, but are still considerably above fixed minimum quotations.

   "text_content" : "Gilt-edged securities opened at prices moderately below yesterday's closing figures, but had recovered well by the time the evacuation plans were announced. With the subsequent dry- ing up of business, prices fell away to about their opening levels, and thus showed a general decline on balance. Starting at 901, War Loan 31 per cents, were up to 91 at one time, but finished as they started, showing a de- cline of g on the day. Conversion 32 per cent. closed at 891, having been up to 90, while 24 per cent. Consols were very dull in the afternoon, finishing 1i down on balance at 642 after recovering from 651 to 66. Local Loans, at 76, were another weak feature. The free movement of quotations induced a little busiliess in \"swaps\" for institutional investors, but the volume of general business was de- cidedly smaller, especially in the afternoon. India stocks opened dull with British Government issues, and, after a firm period, relapsed. Quotations were unchanged on balance. There was little change in Dominion and Colonial issues, which had mostly remained near their fixed minima. Australia 5 per cent. 1945-75 remained active, with business recorded from 96 to 100. The minimum price is 95. \"Ex-interest\" minimum prices were available at the close for application, when business is resumed, to stocks with interest payments due on 5th October. The new minimum for 2j per cent. Consols will be 62 and that for Local Loans 731. FOREIGN BONDS ACTIVE The course of Foreign bond prices followed the general trend and closed with a fairly widespread fall. Far Eastern loans again attracted most attention, but changes were ad- verse. Despite the expected payment of to-day's coupon, Chinese 1898 were marked down 2 to 48. The 1913 were a point lower at 31. Falls ranging up to 14 were recorded in Japanese issues, but the 56 per cent. Conversion Loan was an exception with a rise to 43. The Home Railway group opened weakly, with prices slightly below overnight levels. Towards midday a slight' improvement in sentiment brought about a partial recovery, but the market finally followed the weak- ness of gilt-edged following the an- nouncement of the closure of the Stock Exchange. Nevertheless there was little sell- ing, business remaining very quiet throughout the day. At the close L.M.S. 1923 Preference showed the largest change, being 3 points lower at 35. Great Western Ordinary re- ceded to 361 as compared with 38k on Wednesday evening and L.N.E.R. 4 per cent. First Preference were 24 off at 29. Southern Deferred shed 11 to close at 111, but elsewhere losses were fractional and a number of quotations remained as before. ARG. RAILS AGAIN FIRM Argentine issues again provided the only strong feature of the Foreign Rail section. There were few move- ments in the Ordinary stocks, but the prior charges met with a quiet de- mand sufficient to raise prices in a thin market. B.A. Great Southern 4 per cent. debenture gained a full point to 494 and B.A. and Pacific closed k higher at 291. Central Argen- tine 4 per cent. Redeemable debenture and 5 per cent. debenture (1967-87) were also supported and closed A to the good at 49k and 50 respectively. Cordoba Central 3j per cent. deben- ture were marked 1 point higher at 54. Wednesday's firm tendency in the American Rail section was reversed to-day. While business remained difficult in view of the Treasury regu- lations, prices were lower. Atchison were outstandingly weak and closed 41 points down at 231. Baltimore and Ohio contributed the only rise in the section, adding I to 51. OPTION INQUIRY SMALL The general atmosphere of caution and the difficulty of dealing combined to reduce option business. Brokers were nevertheless willing to deal at overnight rates. Interest in Kaffir and other Gold shares continued, although on a much smaller scale than previously. Call options for Venterspost and Blyvoors. were again in evidence and Libanons were also mentioned. Gold Coast Selection continued in demand in the West African, group and a number of deals were recorded. Among Oils, the same contraction of inquiry was noted, but Mexican Eagles attracted some attention, money being given for a call of the Preference shares. Industrial options were similarly neglected and apart from a few scat- tered dealings in such leaders as British Oxygen little business was transacted. transacted.~",

   "text_content" : "All considerations of business were overridden yesterday by the an- nouncement, just before lunch, of the Government's decision to put its evacuation scheme for children and other \"priority classes \" into opera- tion this morning. In accordance with the Stock Exchange Committee's in- tentions, announced yesterday morn- ing, this involves the closing of the House until it becoimes practicable to reopen it, and, for 'the moment at least, there will be no business at all, although skeleton staffs will be up this norning in some offices. Before this news; came out prices were quite good--irdeed, I heard of one considerable bldck of War Loan being sold at 91. After the announce- ment business virtually came to an end, members spe'ding their time discussing the implications of the evacuation order, which clearly in- volves the disorganisation of almost all households outside London. Far Eastern Bonds As an illustration of the rapidity with which prices can be changed by political developments, and of the necessity of watching the political kaleidoscope for investment pointers, it is interesting to note that the Chinese Four and a-Half per Cent. Gold Loan of 1898, which stood at 38 when I wrote about it last Saturday, now stands at 52. As I suggested then, due payment will be made to-day of the half-yearly coupon. The other Chinese issues have moved correspondingly. The Five per Cent. \"Boxer\" Loan, 1925-47, which was quoted at 32 last Saturday, now stands at 41, while the Five per Cent. Reorganisation Gold Loan of 1913 has come up from. 25 to 33. I think, there i further ,sapetae~,ia l44 these three for the speculative in- vestor. The Japanese issues have also risen considerably on the week, as the fol- lowing table shows:- Price Price LOAN 24th Aug. 31st Aug. Japan 4% 1899 .... 22 27 Japan 5% 1907 ...... 28 33Y Japan 4% 1910 ...... 21 25 Japan 6% 1924 ...... 31 39 Japan 5%% 1930 ... 36 43 Dealings without a Bank of England certificate can take place in the senior Chinese issue and in the Four per Cent. Japanese Loan of 1899 and the Six per Cent. Japanese Loan of 1924. The S.A. Gold Shock It is still uncertain, even after yes- terday's explanatory statement, what is the exact meaning and scope of the surprise announcement on Wednesday that the South African Government proposes \"at the next session\" of Parliament to seek power to appropri- ate the proceeds of all sales of gold above the price of 150s per fine ounce. The announcement has had the natural effect of bringing the incipient upward trend of Kaffirs to a halt. If this measure is merely a precau- tionary move to stop undesirable speculation in the event of war, it may be unobjectionable to the companies and the Kaffir market. If, on the other hand, it is intended to be a permanent expropriation, it seems to be a short- sighted measure and also one which cuts right across the present under- standing between the companies and the Government on grade policy. The higher the price of gold the lower the grade of ore which it is practicable to handle, and, of course, the longer the lives of the mines. which are as important a source of revenue to the Government as to the shareholders. Apart from its effect upon milling policy, this measure, if it is meant to be permanent, will hamper the development of new pro- perties most seriously by making\" the raising of money a very difficult problem. Ashanti Until the truth about this measure is known there will certainly be little business in the shares of the develop- ing mines. The established Kaffirs, on the other hand, are still very much lower than they were two or three years ago on a price of gold below 150s. Thus the established Kaffir dividend- payers should certainly not be sold. Incidentally it has now been decided hIdIL Llhna. b^a ur VnfIUL ZlJn^^ t lli LosIU earer U IIiamr sillnares on which there is an optional payment of coupons in Paris do not come within the Treasury's restrictions. While uncertainty lasts, however, new money seeking to take advantage of the undeniable attractions of Gold shares will probably go into the best West Africans rather than Kaffirs. Here, of course, the paramount share is Ashqnti Goldfields, which 'yields almost peactly 6 per cent. on last year's payepnt at its present price of 68s 9d. Last year's 95 per cent. dividends should be maintained on the increased capit l. There is, of course, no question of any restriction on the benefit derivable by the West Africans from a rise in the price of gold. ite (hh i~at",

   "text_content" : "THURSDAY Evening. The Industrial market was inclined to follow the course of gilt-edged stocks, and accordingly pursued an easier tendency during the afternoon. Overnight political news exercised some restraint upon public enterprise and the late demand for equities dried up practically. Little in the way of selling was en- countered but the principal shares were easier and THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index fell 2 points to 96.6. Dealings decreased and the total of recorded bargains in all markets was 3,020. Again no effort was made to start a Street market in American and other shares. BANK SHARES IRREGULAR Mostly Easier But Some Home Issues Higher After the strength of the past two days the market was quite prepared to see a slowing up of the forward movement in BANKING shares. Prices turned easier in some instances. The volume of business was smaller and outside the Home issues very little was going on. Among the firmer features, Barclays \" B \" changed up to 69s 9d and left off at 68s with a net gain of Is. Westminsters left off Is 6d to the good at 77s 6d and bargains were reported up to 79s. On the other hand, Midland Â£2 10s issues were Y easier and National Provincial (14s paid) reacted 2s to 42s 6d. Barclays (D.C. and 0.) Preference were Is down at 35s. Royal of Scotland stock fell 5 to 430. National Discount \" B.\" shed % to 11%. Changes among the principal Overseas issues were adverse. Chartered of India were Y off at 6% and Hongkong and ShangiqasL Ashuae. shares reacted 2 points t680. Standard of South Africa, after the late rise, shaded off / to 12. Owing to paucity of business there was little or no movement in the INSURANCE section. Prudential \" A \" were dealt in at 30% and Pearl at 17%. Bargains were done in Eagle Stars at 65s 6d and 67s 6d. London Assurance changed at 12%. Business was idle among INVESTMENT TRUSTS. Premier Investment Ordinary was marked down a point on a small sale. African Consolidated Investments deben- tures changed hands at 45. COMMUNICATIONS were inactive. At the end Cable and Wireless Ordinary was 49, perhaps rather buyers. Canadian Marconis rallied to 4s 3d. G.E.C REACTIONARY In the ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT section a comparatively light turnover left irregular changes in prices. British Insulateds were 2s higher at 84s 6d, but no change was miade in Callender's Cables, these remaining at 62s, although business was recorded at 61s. Crompton Parkin- sons were on offer and changed down to 17s 3d, the closing quotation of 17s 9d showing a loss of 9d. The recent buying of General Electrics received a check and the shares, which rose Is 3d yesterday, reacted Is to 75s. English Electrics on cessation of demand eased 6d to 34s 6d. Johnson and Phillips at 38s 6d and Henley's Telegraphs at 18s were each 6d higher. There was no decided tendency in the ELECTRIC SUPPLY group. Dealings were unimportant and prices were not put to a proper test. Transactions were recorded in County of London Electrics at 39s and Edmundsons at 23s 6d. City of London Lights eased 3d to 29s, while British Powers declined 6d to 25s 6d. Midland Counties Electrics changed at 37s and North-Easterns at 29s. Victoria Falls Powers changed up to 66s 3d in a modest turnover. Perak River Powers were done at 13s 10%d. Business up to 105 again was reported in Imperial Continental Gas stock. Gas Light and Coke shares were mentioned up to 20s 3d. MORRIS MOTORS LOWER MOTOR shares experienced a reversal of the late tendency, but in a few instances resistance was offered. Raleigh Holdings held their ground, changing again at 42s 6d. Albions were dealt in at 47s 6d. . Several shares opened firm, but went off during the afternoon. Austin \"A,\" after changing at 28s, finished at 27s and Thomas Tillings ended at 46s, against 46s 6d yesterday, after business was done at 47s 3d in the earlier dealings. Declines of %s apiece occurred in Rolls- Royce at 5,s. and in Leyland Motors at 4%.. Morris closed Is down at 30s 6d, while losses of 9d each took place in Fords at 16s 9d and Standards at 15s 9d. STANTON IRONS GOOD Staveley Coal Rise on Final Dividend Statement AVIATION issues did not absorb much interest. Bristols were inquired for and hardened to 16s 9d,,but Faireys, in which bargains up to 19s 3d were reported, finished 6d lower, at 18s 6d. Hawker Siddeleys closed (ull at 15s 6d, after changing at 16s and 15s. De Havillands and Handley Page were steady. COMPONENTS were reactionary in some cases. Dunlops changed down to 26s 9d and left off at 27Wifj athpet loss of sla 3d. Triplex Glass, too, ren offer and deal- ings down to 33s 1i d were recorded; the price closed Is 8d ,dowi at 33s 9d. Conditions were, quieter in the SHIPPINo group, and FurneasB Withys, after yester- day's gain of Is, ted 6d to 18s 3d. P. and 0, Deferredthaged at 18s 6d and King Line at Trading was on a ,diminished scale in the STEF.L and A MENT section, and I during the afternoon the tone became dull. The tendency turned easier, but apart from a sharp reaction in Vickers no serious declines occurred, since cnmnaratively few during the afternoon the tone became dull. from a sharp reaction in Vickers no serious declines occurred, since comparatively few sellers were about. A few fresh gains were secured. Demand for Stanton Irons was resumed in a moderate way and the price advanced Is 3d more to 52s 6d. Hadfields further improved 6d to 25s and Tube Investments Is 3d to 86s 3d. John Browns were steady at 28s 3d. Harland and Wolff held to 9s 3d. The principal downward movement was in Vickers, which at 17s 4%d lost yester- day's gain of 1Y0%d. Stewarts and Lloyds were 6d off at 43s 3d, after the advance of 3s 3d over the last two days. Babcock and Wilcox at 46s lost 6d of yesterday's improvement of Is 6d, and Cammell Lairds reacted 4Y.d to 7s. Thornycrofts were 7%d easier at 34s 4%d and Birmingham Small Arms 3d off at 27s. Among COLLIERY issues, Staveleys were outstanding on the final dividend state- ment; this gave satisfaction to the market, and the shares advanced Is 3d to 41s 3d. Powell Duffryns continued their advance 6d to 16s and Sheepbridge were firmer at 42s 3d on the final dividend published this morning. Changes were not important in the GENERAL ENGINEERING section. Gloucester Wagons were firm at 25s after yesterday's buying, and G. D. Peters were dealt in at 25s. Birmingham Railway Carriage were 25s, rather buyers. British Aluminiums were changing at 56s 10Y2d. Birmids were steady at 50s and Brockhouse at 39s. Pressed Steels were mentioned at 17s 6d. Chemical descrip- tions did not offer much resistance to the changed conditions and were left to their own devices. In consequence, Imperial Chemicals finished 9d down at 29s 9d, while British Oxygens reacted %, to 3'%. and Murex %'/, to 3%. Turner and Newalls yielded Is 3d to 79s 6d. United Molasses were down 9d to 23s 6d. Firmness was displayed by Imperial Smeltings at 9s 3d and Swedish Match \" B\" at 23s. Pinchin Johnsons held yesterday's rise to 23s ld. Associated Cements reacted 2s 6d to 70s and declines of 6d each took place in British Plaster Boards to 27s 3d and London Bricks to 32s 6d. BRITISH CELANESE SOLD Recessions Among Principal Store Descriptions Sharp movements took place among popular RAYON shares. Transactions re- corded in Courtaulds ranged from 28s to 29s 6d and the final quotation of 29s showed a loss of Is on the day, British Celanese issues were realised, but sales were light; they came, however, on an unwilling market and prices accord- ingly gave way sharply. The Second Pre- ference finished Is 3d down at 12s and on a little selling the First Preference yielded 9d to 17s 3d. The Ordinary changed down to 5s 6d and at the end were 3d off at 6s. Feature of the COTTON TEXTILE group was the further recovery of 9d to 29s 3d in J. and P. Coats,. making the shares 2s 6d higher since Tuesday. In other directions prices were steady excepting for Patons and Baldwins, which shaded off Is to 49s. In the Merchanting group, A. and S. Henry improved to 7s. Leading STORE shares became re- actionary, and at the end Marks and Spencer \"A\" were 3s 9d down at 55s, after changing at 58s in the early deal- ings. Woolworths were down Is 6d to 63s and Great Universals fell 9d to 29s 6d. British Home Stores shaded off 3d to 5s 7%d. Boots Pure Drug, which rose yesterday Is 6d, reacted Is to 42s 6d. Timothy Whites remained firm. Beechams Pills Deferred eased 3d to 7s 9d, but the Pre- ferred Ordinary were marked up Is 3d to 28s 9d. Small price changes were made among FOODSTUFF issues. In the Provision Store group, International Stores reacted 6d to 10s 6d. Lever Bros. & Unilever were a few pence off at lI'i., but the 7 per cent. and 8 per cent. Preferences shed Is each to the common price of 25s. Lever N.V. fell %a to 1'%.. Cerebos rose %. to 8%. Tate and Lyles reacted 9d to 62s. TOBACCOS were dull with a weakish undertone. British-Americans fell %s to 4% and Imperials % to 6%.. Carreras \"A \" were A.i easier at 6%.. Gallahers remained steady, as did United Souths. DISTILLERS DOWN The close of business saw the BREWERY market with rather irregular movements. Mitchells and Butlers were '%/ to the good at 3'V/, but there were declines of that amount in Bass at 6%, Guinness at 4\"%. and Watneys at 3%e. Distillers dropped 2s 9d to 93s 6d, but there was a rally of 6d in Seager Evans to 10s 9d. Hudson's Bays provided the only impor- tant movement among LAND shares by declining 6d to 18s. Sudan Plantations were 23s 3d and Forestal Lands 16s. Associated British Pictures lost part of their recent improvement, closing 6d down at 10s 6d. Associated Provincial Picture Houses weakened 3d to 11s 3d, but the Gaumont issues were steady, the Ordinary being 3s 9d and the Preference 10s 6d. RECENT ISSUES Interest Small Business in recently issued Industrial securities was too slight to affect prices. Engineering and Lighting Ordinary were quoted 2s 1%d, Initial Services 20s 6d, Beechams Maclean Preference par and William Dennys 22s. Prices of issues made in past three months appear on Page Two Special Closing Prices of Industrial rketv Shares appear on Page Two",

Reference to the present statement will show that, until further notice, settlement of open bargains will be suspended, and there will be no obligation on members to open their offices. Due notice will be broadcast of the date of reopening the Stock Exchange. The Children Close the House Action of the Stock Exchange Com- mittee is based upon the evacuation of the school-children that starts to- day. This will continue until the children, some of the mothers and blind people have left London. The Government has informed the Stock Exchange that all its arrangements are ready for moving the little ones, and the others, away from the Metropolis. If these Government arrangements operate according to schedule, and three days prove sufficient to carry out the evacuation plan, the Stock Exchange might be able to open on Monday next; or, at the latest, on Tuesday. If the transport arrange- ments fail to come up to anticipation, then it may happen that the Stock Exchange will be closed for a few days longer; unless, that is to say, there should be an outbreak of war, when the House would be definitely closed. To Remove Misapprehension It should be particularly observed that the fact of the Stock Exchange being closed to-day has nothing to do with any immediate fear of an out- break of war. The decision rests solely upon the difficulties that would arise of people getting to and from the City during the evacuation days. For prices to react unfavourably to the decision is due to the fact that Stock Exchange closing, for however brief a period, tends to bring more closely home the' possibility of war. Against this can be set the certainty that an evacuation of London will con- vince Herr Hitler, as nothing else could, of the assurance that this country is in unshakable earnest about carrying out its pledge to fight Germany if Poland is attacked. Skeleton Staffs The official Stock Exchange notice, given in yesterday's paper, to the effect that if it becomes impossible to carry on in the City the Stock Exchange will move to Denham, con- firms rumours which had been current in the House for a week or more. These were followed by further rumours, now found to be erroneous, to the effect that the accommodation at Denham had been secured by another institution which stepped in before the House had completed negotiations. There is still to be heard in various markets the opinion, even yet, that the necessity for removal will not arise. Some firms of brokers had already ad- vised clients of telephone numbers and addresses to which clients could send inquiries if the House were closed, most of these being the private houses of partners in the firms. Stock Exchange offices in.the City will occasionally be found open, work- ing under skeleton staffs. The Stock Exchange Committee will be repre- sented, for the moment, by the sub- committee that is in charge of emergency measures. Liable to Mislead The reaction in prices may be ascribed to atmosphere rather than to actual selling of stock. On the pre- vious two days, the improvement came about largely through sentiment; yes- terday, the dulness which developed was due less to any attempt to sell than to withdrawal of previous sup- port. Business became noticeably more quiet than it was on Wednesday, when, however, there was by no means the rush of orders reported in some directions. Statements as to brokers having been very busy are liable to be as mis- leading as can any snapshot taken from a high window above the House, and pointing down to a floor which, having been recently watered, looks as though it were a slush-covered area populated by a few men who are any- thing but busy.",

   "text_content" : "G0OOD INDUSTRIAL NEWS NEGLECTED INDUSTRIALS 1.75 POINT LOWER From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTt NEW YORK, 31st August. History was by way of repeatin, itself to-day, the only difference as con pared with yesterday being that th turnover was still lower-460,00 against 500,000-while the downwar trend was rather more pronounced. In the end the Dow-Jones average so Industrials was 1.75 points lower a 134.41. Railways declined from 26.4 to 26.1 and Utilities from 25.04 to 25.54 The close was easy and the politic. factor in the declines, such as it was, i apparent from the fact that U.S. bond were rather weak. The feeling of inter national tension outweighed the encourag ing nature of domestic business news. SHOCKS FROM LONDON More specifically, it was the numerou signs of war preparations which had depressing effect on prices. The evacua lion of women and children from Londo and the complete mobilisation of th British Navy were unsettling influences News that the London Stock Exchang was closing for a day also had a depres sing effect, though not to the extent whic: might have been supposed, because it i realised that this is merely part of th evacuation process. Under normal circumstances such sign might have produced acute weakness, bu abnormalities, in the present situation, ar no longer recognisable as such for th public, which seemingly is shockproof. The only rallying signs appeared in th last hour, when rumours that Signo Mussolini might mediate caused a dull an( unimpressive rally. Most of these gain were short-lived. The Federal Housing Administratioi figures of weekly mortgage appraisal show that home-building is tending to lag and this is attributed in part to foreig uncertainties. There is every evidence here of a desir to maintain financial services under an circumstances and as far as practicable. MONEY MARKET LIAISON Mr. G. L. Harrison, president of th Federal Reserve Bank of New York, ha appointed a committee to serve as liaiso between the Money market, the Reserv Bank and the various Government agencie in the case of war. Members representin the commercial banks are Mr. J. I- Perkins, chairman of the National Cit Bank of New York, Mr. W. C. Pottei chairman of the Guaranty Trust Compani Mr. W. W. Aldrich, chairman of the Chas National Bank, and Mr. J. C. Traphagei president of the Bank of New York. Ir vestment bankers are represented by M: H. S. Morgan, of Morgan Stanley and Co and savings banks by Mr. C. A. Millai chairman of the Savings Bank Trust. The Board appointed six weeks ago t study the idea of a brokerage bank pr( posed by the Securities and Exchang Committee to safeguard customers c brokers' firms rejects this plan. BROKER AND CLIENT Other points not meeting with recorr mendation are the proposal for a geners guarantee fund, the plan that customer! cash in brokers' hands should either b segregated from brokers' funds or de posited under earmark with commercis banks unless the broker has obtained th customer's specific authorisation to use hi deposit, and that the income of Stock Ea change members should be increased by minimum monthly service charge coverin the safe keeping and handling o securities. Further, the suggestion is rejected tha the income of the Stock Exchange shoul be increased by a transaction tax pes mitting a balanced budget, that ther should be fidelity insurance covering Stock Exchange partners and employees, that firms engaged in underwriting in excess of capital be required to separate under- writing from brokerage business and that firms give customers an audited certified financial statement at least once a year.

   "text_content" : "NEW YORK, 31st August. The opening in Wall Street was quiet and easy. With the European outlook considered rather more threatening, the market during the morning eased by frac- tions as timid holders quietly lightened their commitments. At midday the Steel, Copper, Chemical, Rail and Entertainment groups were fractions to a point down. A long list of stocks was that much lower in the early afternoon, when the losses in the Steel and Chemical sections extended to as much as 2, these divisions being the heaviest of the whole market. The Rails, however, showed resistance on the figures of the week's freight car-load- ings reaching a new high level for the year. Utility shares sagged slightly, though many authorities believe that this group will be a feature of any recovery, but Oil issues kept steady as the production of crude oil was resumed. A feeble rally in the later operations lacked follow-through, and the tone at the close was easy. Moody's daily index of staple com- modity prices was, to-day 140.3, against 140.3 yesterday. On the Bond market to-day Government securities and Railway bonds were easy. Sterling opened 4Yc down at $4.35% offered and declined further to $4.32 during the morning. The rate subse- quently eased again to $4.29 (offered), but then improved to $4.29%. The rate con- tinued to advance and finally closed 7%c lower at $4.32. Silver was Ic lower at 35%c. Gold imports from England were $28,399,000. Amounts earmarked for foreign account increased by $77,494,000.",

The market closed generally lower, with operations below normal, though activity increased moderately after the announcement of further British mobilisation. Losses ranged to $2.00. Selling was mainly concentrated on the Gold shares; the seniors recorded sizable losses from the opening. The pivotal Base-metal issues declined in quiet dealings, while the losses in the Industrial group were mostly confined to fractions. Steel and Miscellaneous Manufacturers' issues were rather weak.

   "text_content" : "THUKR DAY Evening. News that the evacuation scheme was to be put into operation and the consequent decision to close the Stock Exchange caused some selling of Oil shares this afternoon. Earlier dealings had seen the market with a relatively firm appear- ance, but the afternoon developments had the effect of making dealings even more difficult than of late. Prices became somewhat nominal, but nevertheless closed without any serious declines. The volume of busi- ness done during the session was quite small. Royal Dutch Dealings Shells improved to 4; during morning dealings but finally were %' down on the day at 4V. Royal Dutch, in which deal- ings are restricted by order of the Treasury, were dealt in a few times at 35w. Burmahs weakened -%2 to 3V:1 but Anglo-Iranians were relatively firm with a decline of !\" only at 3%. Business in Attocks was recorded between 52s and 53s 9d and the shares finished with a loss of 7Yd at 52s 6d. Anglo-Egyptian \" B\" were lowered is to 3%.

   "text_content" : "Yesterday's announcement that th: Stock Exchange would, be closed to day accentuated the feeling tha the world is out of joint, but it i: advisable that no exaggerated impor tance should be attached to the actiol of the Committee. This, and the de cision of some other markets to follow the lead, are the corollaries of initia evacuation and its transport prob lems, timed to take place at the week-end as causing the least disturb ance to business. That is purely a measure of precaution, and in view o the Committee's earlier notice, the temporary closing of the House fol lowed automatically. Here and there a member was inclined to complain that the Committee, in shutting the Exchange, had gone beyond the limits of its warning, which stated tha \"'civil evacuation,\" not \"children': evacuation,\" would presage closing The argument is, however, rathe thin, the more so when it is considered that some 30,000 people have to mov: into the City in connection with Stocl Exchange - business. Travelling facilities will be severely curtailed during the greater part of to-day. The situation previously envisaged by the Committee where \"it will be physic ally impossible for members and thei staffs to get to their offices\" ha: therefore come into being. The extent of the \"necessary fev days \" of the closure is still uncertain, but it can be taken that the intentiol is, if possible, to resume business by Monday. It is certain that reopening will not be unnecessarily delayed. As far as business is concerned, the latest level of prices does not offe. nearly as much attraction to pur chasers as was evident when the gilt edged list was around its minima Although advances beyond the latter have been reduced slightly, they may be instanced again by War Loan, 1J up at 90k, and old Consols, 24 up at 643 in spite of the day's ups and downs War Loan, the bell-wether, changre hands at prices ranging from 89J to 914 as market views varied from early apprehension to stiffened determina tion, or even optimism. The House, disappointed though i is at being debarred from business is resigned to its enforced holiday Certain inconveniences result in a technical sense, such as the ante dating of to-day's option declarations The consequential arrangements wil need the attention of such members o brokers' staffs as can reach thei offices during the time the House i; closed, and in other respects the inter vening days will not be wasted. Th: task of bringing the financia machinery into closer relation witl exceptional needs is constantly absorbing attention. Provision has now been made for facilitating trans fers of Consol market stocks \"in th= event of an emergency.\" The list o securities \"deemed to be\" subject to the Treasury control has been amended by the deletion of a numbe of South African Mining Beare shares erroneously included, as noted in this column yesterday. It will be a matter for more general satisfactioi if the delay now unavoidably attendant upon some cheque clearing: can be reduced, since payees are ou of their money longer than has been customary. Progress in numerous such matters doubtless will be chronicled without avoidable delay The resumption of Stock Exchange business is scheduled to follow closely upon the completion of evacuation and this is highly desirable in orde to ensure that the interruption of the City's functions shall be of th: shortest possible duration."

   "text_content" : "The decision to decontrol sterling in order to avoid an excessive drain on the resources of the Exchange Equali- sation Fund has proved a sound move in another respect. As yesterday's return of the Bank of England shows, the accelerated deniand for currency, which is directly attributable to the quickening of various defence measures during the past week, has been met- without detriment to the credit base. The gold stock has been revalued at the official price of 158s 6d per fine ounce fixed on Wed- nesday, or ten shillings higher than in last week's return, as a result of the depreciation of the pound in terms of dollars. This has raised the sterling value of the Bank's gold holding by Â£16,600,000 and the total note issue by a similar amount, and has offset to a substantial extent the effect of the currency demands which have in- creased the note circulation by Â£21,400.000 to a new all time record of Â£529,500,000. The exceptional conditions under which the country is now functioninc are responsible for the larger note circulation. In such critical times most people endeavour to keep a little more cash in hand than usual to guard against contingencies in the event of war. Precautionary food purchases and the many other directions in which preparations are being made to withstand the first shock of a possible outbreak of hostilities all make for a large circulation of, money, while the mobilisation of members of the forces, preparation of evacuation schemes and full employment of man power on defence work. alike necessitate a freer flow of curren'y. The drain on bank cash has been made good to a large extent by the purchase of bills in the market by the authorities, which has prevented anything but a relatively small decline of some Â£2,000,000 in bankers' deposits with the central institution.",

   "text_content" : "Yesterday's fall in sterling on news of evacuation and mobilisation was symptomatic of the continually chang- ing reaction of the exchanges to the course of the crisis. Dealings were fairly substantial, but not excessive, which indicated that the decline was largely due to psychological influ- ences. The absence of a brighter turn in the immediate political outlook led to the closing rate of $4.28g being about the worst of the day. The un- certainty about the future rate has resulted almost inevitably in the de- section of Scandinavian currencies from the sterling group. Looked at f:im the countries concerned, this is an elementary precaution against the risk of internal inflation, which is likely to remain in operation for the immediate future. Whether there will be any move to link these currencies to the dollar in the meantime is not certain, though that currency, it has to be reckoned, offers the advantage of being the most immune from the re- percussions of any European crisis. The Swiss franc, Dutch guilder and Belgian belga are all based upon it, while the Reichsmark is in a fictitious way also fixed to the dollar. In South America the position is less clear-cut, Brazil having linked itself to New York, while the Argentine peso re- mains attached to London for the time being. the breakaway of the Scandinavian currencies may intensify Britain's trading difficulties with those coun- tries upon whom we are dependent for large foodstuffs imports. The depre- ciation of sterling must tend to worsen the balance of trade by turning the terms of exchange against us. Whether it will be possible to rectify the position by increasing exports under the stimulus provided by the cheapening of British goods in these markets depends upon exports of the right kind and of sufficient quantity being available. This perhaps is look- ing rather far ahead. The present fall in the sterling exchange has been ex- ceptionally influenced by sentiment and in consequence the bull account in dollars-perhaps the largest on record-has been built up. When it comes to closing that account, there will be considerable pressure toward an appreciation of sterling which may even have to be resisted. The technical position of sterling is strong and by all current indications the pound is undervalued. This inherent strength will reassert itself when the position becomes more settled one way or another.",

   "text_content" : "The decision of the directors of the Prudential Assurance Company, an- nounced to-day, to defer consideration as to payment of an interim dividend has been dictated by the uncertainty of the international situation. This may come as rather a shock to holders of the \"A\" shares, who alone are concerned, since \"B\" shareholders receive their dividend only once a year, usually in March. In fact the decision of the Board is a sound pre- cautionary measure. It is, of course, no reflection on the strength of an insurance office whose total of life policies in force assuring over Â£878,000,000 illustrates its almost unique proportions and ramifications. For the last four years interim divi- dends of 25 per cent., tax free, equal to 5s per share net and costing Â£312,500 each time, have been paid on the \"A\" shares. These have been followed by final payments on an in- creasing scale, rising from 68-i per cent. in 1935 to 732 per cent. last year. All but a very small part of the pay- ments represent shareholders' profits from the Ordinary and Industrial life branches of the business. The first duty of an insurance office is to safe- guard the interests of policyholders, and the possibility of war with its potentialities for heavy mortality among the civilian population as well as armed forces makes it essential that insurance resources should be con- served pending a clarification of the international situation.",

   "text_content" : "There is no indication in the report of the extent to which the Ketton Portland Cement Company has bene- sited during the past year through the demands of rearmament. Activity in this sphere must have played some part directly, as well as indirectly through the company's half-share of the capital of Ribblesdale Cement. The latter was engaged in the supply of cement for the Government factory at Chorley, Lancashire, and no doubt this was the main factor in the expan- sion of the Ketton Company's invest- ment income from Â£7,800 to Â£17,400. A rise of very similar extent (Â£9,500) took place in the company's own trading profit, which is returned at Â£78,500. Taxation absorbs Â£5,600 more at Â£21,000, and after allowing for repetition of the Â£20,000 transfer to depreciation reserve, net profit is Â£13,500 better at Â£58,700. The com. pany's third manufacturing unit was only in production for three months of the year, and the results seemn very satisfactory for a period which, if bringing activity in some directions, was one of considerable disturbance in others. Maintenance of the Ordinary divi- dend at 15 per cent. cpncerns Thos. W. Ward, which controls the company besides distributing its product. The payment carries a participation of 1I per cent. for the Seven and a-Half per Cent.

The plant and buildings are stated to have been fully maintained out of revenue, and against an aggregate of Â£530,600 to cover their .cost and also that of all ,ther fixed assets there will now be a lepreciation reserve of Â£140,000. The cost of the third unit stands at Â£117,900, against Â£2,900. The expendi- ure has reduced the cash balance by Â£36,000 to a nominal amount and there a a bank overdraft of Â£43,600, but this neans that the major part of the out- ay has been met out of the company's own resources.",

Net profit is Â£350,000, of .hich Â£224,100 was derived from mining and Â£125,900 from investments. The comparison is with a profit of 3402,500, of which the mine section contributed Â£276.200 and the invest nent section Â£126,300. The figfures are in Australian currency, in which Â£125 Australian is equivalent to Â£100 English.

Allowing for the payment in Aus- ralian currency, the current price of O0s for the 5s shares indicates a yield of about 8 per cent. in English cur- rency.

Tarry and Co., the South African manufac- turers of mining and agricultural machinery and hardware and timber merchants, were below those rs 1937-38, but the company was able to repeat the 6 per cent. dividend with- out difficulty. Net profit was Â£30,200, against Â£44,700. The reduction is a reflection of the general recession in trade last year, from which South Africa was not immune despite the ad- vantage of the gold-mining industry. The resumption of payments on the Ordinary shares a year ago after a lapse of eight years followed four good years during which the company was able to clear up. its Preference arrears and build up a satisfactory reserve. At the annual meeting a year ago the falling off in British overseas com- merce was fully recognised. Since the company has re-established its position, the setback last year may be temporary, but a further recovery de- pends in the main on a revival of world trade. In any case, the gold- mining industry, which is the stand- by of South Africa, shows little evidence of decline. At the current price of about 17s 6d the Â£1 shares of E.W.

A Stock Exchange authority informe THE FINANCIAL TIMES that the cons( quent disturbance to transport arrange ments -was the deciding factor in th Committee's decision. It had been esti mated that, for Stock Exchange busi ness, some 30,000 persons travel to th City every day. It is anticipated by the Committe that the progress of evacuation will b so advanced that the Stock Exchang will be reopened on Monday and tha oontango Day procedure will be followe as usual, subject to no worsening of th 3risis.

   "text_content" : "i! AY by day evacuation has been leaving its mark on the popula- - tion of the City. In normal times, the triangular area in front of the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England is thick with people. Twice recently, at the ordinarily busy lunch time, I have looked down on this space from the Bank and have been able almost to count the throng on the fingers of my hands. In the big banks and insurance offices too there is, at times, an almost eerie hush owing to the absence of voices and of hurrying feet. Business as Usual A PRACTICAL illustration of the Smaxim \"Business as usual,\" is afforded by the decision to continue with the issue of Preference stock by the Ilfracombe Gas Company. It is true that a capital issue of any kind needs long preparation, and that, once the date is fixed, matters must go to their logical conclusion, rain or shine. All the same, the appearance of the offer at such a time as now is a beau geste that is deserving of success. Conscience Money NATIONAL crises appear to have a -marked effect in stimulating the sleeping consciences of tardy or reti cent taxpayers. Those curious people who send in small sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the form of \" conscience money\" drummed up to the tune of Â£5,500 in the last financial year. This was more than three times the total of the previous year. Mr. N. C. Havenga -A R.

Yesterday's consideration was devoted to dealing with queries raised by the market and objections made by companies against the inclusion of their issues. The objections were in the main from South African mining companies.

REVISED LIST ON MONDAY Space. consideration prevents the pub- ication of the full amended list in to-day's ssue, but the revised compilation will be ,ublished in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Vonday. An original list, devoted to gilt-edged ;ecurities, was drawn up on the initiation f a firm of dealers in the market con- :erned. This was published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Wednesday. On the nvitation of these dealers, jobbers in other narkets prepared lists of issues deemed ikely to be affected in their sections of ;he House. The resulting aggregated :ompilation was the one published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday. No official guidance was received from ;he Bank of England or Treasury as to ;he exact securities affected, and in the ibsence of a lead the jobbers did the best .hey could in difficult circumstances. While the lists have been in no way )fficial, they have been recognised as a iseful guide by the House, banks and nvestors. The legal position as regards the pay- nent of interest in foreign currency is a natter for close attention and this is being ,iven. SETTLEMENT RULING Stock Exchange bargains done after 16th August last in those securities which tre affected by the Treasury Order of that late, and of which the Settlement Depart- nent undertakes the settlement, should not >e entered on the Clearing Lists due to be ;ent in on Monday next. Bargains done in or before that date should be entered is usual. The Treasury Order of 26th August )rohibits owners of certain foreign securi- ies from selling, transferring, or doing mything which involves the creation of a harge on those securities, except with ['reasury permission. Owners of the ecurities, whether held in this country ir elsewhere, must make a return to the lank of England of their holdings within me month from Saturday last. Full letails of the Treasury Order were pub- ished in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Ionday last. The work involved in making the re- urns is throwing a considerable amount ,f work on brokers and on the Share and Joan Department, which is examining all locuments before passing them to the lank. The list is believed to contain a large lumber of issues that the Treasury would probably not require in any mobilisation if securities to strengthen the country's",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL POlitical developments were respon- sible for a sharp reaction in the ster- ling exchange yesterday. Continental centres took unkindly to the news of the evacuation arrangement in London and the steps towards fuller mobilisa- tion of our forces. In early dealings, Swiss buying of dollars caused a fall in the rate, but a rally took place when gold arbitra- geurs came in as sellers of dollars. The major depreciation in the pound followed the mobilisation announce- ment, but, as on other occasions of late, the fall in the rate was dispro- portionate to the volume of business. For the second day in succession, the gold price was fixed on a dollar basis and, consequently, was 6d higher at 159s per fine ounce. This quota- tion was at the larger discount of 3d on the shipping parity, small compen- sation for the risk involved in ship- ping the metal across the Atlantic in existing circumstances. Even so, arbitrageurs were the principal buyers of the metal and they were actually rationed to about 80 per cent. of their requirements. Supplies emanated from' hoarders, there being little or no speculative reselling. New Note Record The main features in the Bank Re- turn published yesterday were the expansion in the active note circula- tion and the sharp upward revaluation in the gold holding consequent upon the depreciation of sterling. The growth in the active note issue was almost identical with that regis- tered in the crisis week of September last year, the figures being Â£21.4 and Â£21.7 millions respectively. With this latest addition, the active note circu- lation has established the new high record for all time of Â£529,498,805. Several of the banks had reported a large return of notes from the Con- tinent while some stated that they had paid in large amounts. It would seem, therefore, that the actual efflux on this occasion is in excess of that of Sep- tember last year. The enhanced demand for currency is due, of course, to the extensive evacuation, to the payments made to mobilised men, to additional food pur- chases, etc., and to the desire of many people to hold more cash against eventualities. Migration of banking departments to places of greater safety has also had an effect. Gold Revaluation The authorities took Wednesday's official gold price as the basis for re- valuing gold stocks. As this was 10s per fine ounce above that taken at the previous week's valuation, the metallic stock of the Bank was written up by Â£16.6 millions and the total note issue rose by an identical amount. Hence. despite the huge note efflux, the re- serve in the banking department was only Â£4.9 millions lower at Â£34.2 millions. As on other occasions the authori- ties chose to issue notes up to the value of the gold held in the Issue De- partment as permitted under the appropriate section of the Currency and Bank Notes Act, 1939, instead of transferring the additional gold valuation to the Exchange Fund. The assistance accorded Lombard Street by the special buyer was re- Rected in a rise of Â£13.5 millions in Government securities and the fall in Bankers' Deposits was limited to about Â£2,000,000. Public Deposits, however, jumped nearly Â£8.7 millions to the un- usually high figure of Â£31,000,000. This immobilisation of credit is a re- flection of the heavy calls upon the Exchange Fund before the pound was unpegged, but it is also, no doubt, in preparation for heavy Government interest disbursements to-day. Nominee Companies A further reflection of the situation :reated by the international crisis is :o be found in news of the formation As nominee companies by two well- cnown bill-broking firms in the London discount market. The necessity for the formation of :hese nominee concerns arises from :he emergency measures in connection vith the registration of securities. The ig banks have agreed to securities ieing registered in the names'of dis- :ount houses, but the names of part- lership firms are not eligible. Hence, n order to take advantage of the new neasures and of the greater safety dffering these firms are forming cotn- >anies. The capital can be limited or mlimited. Arrangements have been completed !or establishing a centralised pool of ;ecurities with the Bank of England, vhere they will be registered, and igainst which deposit receipts will be ssued. In addition, it is understood hat banks have received a virtual power of attorney from their Lombard itreet clients to perfect the title to ecurities deposited as collateral for oans.",

   "text_content" : "The London Stock Exchange will be closed to-day. It is hoped to reopen on Monday. The Committee will be in constant session throughout the week-end so as to be able to take a decision on reopening and other matters as early as possible. Inter-office dealings are not expected to take place as would be the case in certain circumstances which might cause the closing of the House. Decision to close the Stock Exchange arises from the interruption of transport facilities through the evacuation of 3,000,000 people, mostly children, from London. (Details Page Four Columns Four and Five.) The Stock Exchanges at Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh also decided to remain closed to-day. London Metal Exchange, the Rubber Exchange and Mincing Lane Stock Exchange will also be closed. Lloyd's, the Baltic and the Corn Exchange are remaining open together with the Banks. (For details see Col. Two below.) STOCKS RALLY AND FALL Announcement of to-day's closing brought Stock Exchange yesterday almost to a standstill. Industrials, which had opened lower, partially finally fell back to opening levels. business on the Gilt-edged and recovered, but Buyers were absent from Wall Street, and the turnover came to no more than 460,000 shares.

   "text_content" : "A complete change in the Stock Ex- change atmosphere was produced by the news that evacuation of London was to be put into effect, with its corollary, already announced, of the closing of the \"House\" during the moving process. Prices opened dull in practically all markets, the morning's European news meeting with a mixed reception. A re covery from early declines was in progress when the news came that evacuation would take place to-day and that the House would close for an unstated period to allow of its completion. GILT-EDGED RECEDE Still Above Minima Business, which had, of course, never been particularly active, came almost to a standstill. The afternoon was occupied largely by the levelling of jobber's books. As usually when activity declines, the trend of prices was unfavourable, particu- larly in British Government stocks and industrial shares-the two sections which had responded most readily to recent hope- ful sentiment. After opening lower at 65Y, Two and a-Half per Cent. Consols improved to 66, but closed very dull at 64%. War Loan started at 90%, and rose to 91, but fell back to its opening level in the afternoon, and other stocks moved in conformity. Although the upward price movement was reversed by the fluctuations on the day, closing quotations were still consider- ably above the minimum prices fixed last week.

Chinese and Japanese bonds, which have recently been reflecting hopes of improvement in Far Eastern politics, were marked down. Home Railways conformed to the general trend of prices, but some rises in Argentine prior charges relieved dulness in the Foreign Railway market. Sentiment towards Industrial shares underwent a reversal and the market became subdued in tone, in contrast with recent optimism. Yesterday's movements were irregular, being mostly downward. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial share index was 96.6, a fall on the day of 2.0. Kaffirs opened with a dull tone under the influence of the Union Government's proposal to appropriate all proceeds of the Continued at foot of elNwng r s um Continued from preceding column gold sales by the Rand mines above 150s per ounce. Subsequently the market came under general influences and prices tailed off to nominal levels in many instances. In few cases, however, did falls on the day exceed 2s 6d.

   "text_content" : "The decision of the Stock Exchange to close to-day is necessitated by lack of transport facilities arising from the evacuation of London schoolchildren. It would obviously be unfair to have the market open to those who, despite this drawback, would still be able to reach the House. The same considerations do not apply to ordinary business houses, many of which are proposing to open as usual to- day. The banks will, of course, be open. Similarly, most . insurance companies, which have not already removed their staffs to the provinces, will open. A representative of THE FINANCIAL TIMES ascertained that the London Metal Exchange, the Rubber Exchange and the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange would be closed to-day. The last named will not reopen until the London Stock Exchange does so. NO SATURDAY SESSION Business To-day On the other hand, many institutions in- tend to carry on to-day, although some of them have already decided not to open for the short session to-morrow. Lloyd's will conduct business to-day. The Baltic and the Corn Exchange will be open to-day, but contrary to the usual practice, will be closed to-morrow. The business conducted on the Baltic falls into three main categories-chartering ships, pur- chase and sale of wheat and other grain, and dealings in oil seeds and vegetable oils. The principal business done on the Corn Exchange is in wheat, barley, oats, maize, flour, cattle foods, hay and straw. There is also an important market in agricul- tural seeds and in cottonseed, mustard seed, linseed, oilseeds, etc. The London Commercial Sale Rooms and the London Coal Exchange will remain open to-day. The former serve as a meet- ing place for merchants and brokers deal- ing in sugar, coffee, tea, spices and other commodities. In the case of markets covered by the London Commercial Sale Rooms it should be noted that the cocoa terminal market will be closed until Monday morning, while the sugar terminal and shellac terminal markets will be closed to-morrow. In some cases, although there will be no official opening of offices for business, a small staff will be in attendance to deal with domestic routine matters.",

Gol arbitrageurs came in as a seller lollars and the rate rallied to $4.38.

Of the 135 bars available, 4 were \"married.\" The bulk of the turn ver of Â£433,000 came from hoarders, a pposed to speculative sellers o Wednesday. The buying came mainly fror rbitrageurs, despite the risk involved i hipments. No support came from th Exchange Fund, and it is understood tha buyers were rationed to about 80 per ceni f their requirements. In later dealings business was mor nodest owing to the difficulty of gettin, way dollars on a rapidly fluctuatin, market, but the price of gold again toppe 60s per fine ounce. CLEARING DELAYS Further evidence of the disturbanc aused by the existing situation was pro ided by the following official statemen f the banks to the general public:- The Committee of London Clearing Bankers gives notice that the collection of cheques and other items is now sub- ject to temporary and unavoidable delay. Customers are warned that they must not regard the proceeds of such items in course of collection as cash normally available for drawings at the expiration of the customary collecting period. This is due mainly to the removal o ountry and metropolitan clearings to th 'otteries. It is understood, however, tha here is no delay over town clearings, ii espect of which cheques are cleared th ame day. As for cheques and other item 'hich pass through the country or metro olitan clearing, under normal circum tances the delay is three or four days. I ; believed that every effort is being mad o extend the scope of local clearings whel nd where possible. The Committee of London Clearin; Bankers also announced yesterday tha he publication of the weekly returns o own clearing, metropolitan clearing an. ountry cheque clearing will be suspende ntil further notice. As provincial clear ig figures will not be on a comparativ asis, their publication will also ceas antil further notice. Further reference Money Market Notes Page 4 Col. 7",

   "text_content" : "NAVY MOBILISES No further exchange of views between the British and German Governments on the Polish situation took place yesterday. All telephone services between this country and the Continent were suspended last night. This followed the final steps taken by the British Government to meet an emergency, including putting into operation the A.R.P. system, complete naval mobilisation, calling up the re- mainder of the Army Reserve and the decision to evacuate London and other danger areas. GERMANY'S PROPOSALS The terms on which Herr Hitler proposed a settlement of the dispute with Poland were announced in an official German broadcast last night. A condition of the proposals was their acceptance by Poland by midnight on Wednesday and the arrival in Berlin by that time of a Polish plenipotentiary with full powers to negotiate a final agreement. The announcer said that Herr Hitler and the German Government had waited two days in vain for a reply and therefore regarded the proposals as practically rejected. Main points of the proposals are:- Danzig to'return to the Reich uncon- ditionally and forthwith; the Corridor to decide by plebiscite after a lapse of twelve months whether it desires to belong to Germany or Poland. An international com- mission to exercise sovereign rights in the territory. Gdynia to remain uncondi- tionally Polish. The German proposals are not a reply to any British proposals. It was learned in official quarters in London that they were only communicated to the Polish Government for the first time last night. A German spokesman in London, com- menting last night on the broadcast, said the proposals were merely a basis of negotiation and nothing more. 'There was no time limit and Germany was still wait- ing for a definite reply from Poland.",

   "text_content" : "Crisis demand for currency has raised the active note issue of the Bank of England by Â£21,435,097 to an all-time high record of Â£529,498,805. The gold stock was revalued at 158s 6d per fine ounce, or 10s more than the week before. Credit base was widened by large purchases of securities. The weekly return of the Bank of England reveals some startling changes in reflection of the crisis. In the first place, demands for cur- rency occasioned by extensive evacua- tion, the calling up of several units, the laying in of food supplies and the eagerness of many people to have addi- tional cash against any eventuality meant a heavy expansion in the active note circulation. The actual increase is Â£21,435,097- a figure strikingly similar to that recorded in the crisis week of Sep- tember last year, when about Â£21.6 millions extra notes were issued. With this latest expansion, however, a new high record for all time is created at Â£529,498,805. Owing to the revaluation of the gold stock at 158s 6d per fine ounce-the highest valuation as yet and 10s above the price taken the previous week-the reserve in the banking department was only Â£4.9 millions lower at Â£34,249,947. As, how- ever, total deposit liabilities were nearly Â£9% millions greater, the ratio was down by 4.6 per cent. at 21.4 per cent. THE CREDIT BASE As the authorities acquired Â£13,460,000 of Government securities during the week, presumably in the course of their efforts to relieve the pressure upon the market of the exodus of notes, the credit base was Â£9.4 millions higher, but bankers' deposits, or market resources, were actually Â£1,988,831 lower at Â£90,143,424.. This state of affairs is due to the im- mobilisation of credit in the hands of the Public Departments owing, presumably, to the time lag which always follows an.y extensive assistance given to the sterling exchange. Public deposits were actually Â£8.696,218 higher at the usual inflated figure of Â£31;067,576. HANKING DEPARTMENT rekO ended 'Week ended I. or dec. 31st AIgust. - 30thAug, for week 6 I.

The comparable figures for 1937-38 were Â£402,501, Â£276,159 and Â£126,342. All of the above figures are in Australian currency (Â£A.125==Â£100 English). The fall in net earnings is, therefore, about 13 per cent. and is due largely to the fall in mining profits. Dividends totalling 40 per cent. on the Â£800,000 capital (5s shares) have been paid, as compared with 80 per cent. An interim of 10 per cent. has been declared in respect of 1939-40.

   "text_content" : "An important ruling concerning the position of a cargo insured to the United Kingdom on pool conditions and whose destination is subsequently changed to a port or place outside the United Kingdom was given yesterday by the War Risks Cargo Pool Management to all members and other underwriters re- insuring with the Pool. The notice also applies when orders are received for the discharge outside the United Kingdom of cargoes in- sured on pool conditions under the provisions for the insurance of ship- ments under optional contracts of affreightment. The managers, it is stated, have reached the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of under- writers for the pool to continue the re- insurance of all war risks, including King's enemy risks on such cargo not- withstanding the change. Accord- ingly. the additional premiums become payable to the pool. KING'S ENEMY RISKS Members of the pool are also informed that the pool will be liable for losses by King's enemy risks as well as other war risks on such cargoes after the destina- tion is changed or the orders are given, and that participating members will be liable for their proportion of such losses. Additional premiums will be charged in the event of goods shipped from outside the United Kingdom-originally insured in accordance with Pool conditions-being ordered to discharge elsewhere than in the United Kingdom. This notice applies provided that under- writers are bound by the terms of the original contract to hold goods covered to destination, the premium to be charged in addition to the pool war rate and strikes rate, being the non-pool rate from the place such orders are received to destina- tion, ruling at the time such orders are received. A reminder was also issued by under- writers to the effect that, under the con- ditions of the War Risks Cargo Pool, no war risks insurances will be accepted' on or after the date of the opening of an office in the United Kingdom by the Gov- ernment for insurance of cargoes against war risks. Sailings or departures by air or post after this particular date under prior insurances will remain insured if sailing or departure is within 30 days from the acceptance of the risk by or the declaration of the risk to the underwriter. The assured will therefore need to make fresh arrangements for cover either with underwriters or with the Government office. The existing schedule of rates applying to non-Pool insurances will, in the event of the outbreak of war, cease to apply, and sailings thereafter will be subject to a new schedule which will be published by the Rating Committee as soon as practic- able. U.S. SCHEME NEW YORK, 31st Aug. War risk insurance on shipments of goods from the United States, which comes into effect at midnight on 5th September, will be on a basis of \"free of British, French or Allied capture and seizure, etc.\" This practice is similar to that followed during the Great War. All war risk insurance on shipments to, from or through Italian and German ports has been cancelled.-Reuter.",

Ickes, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, announces the establishment at Lansing (Michigan) of an investigating office, under the Connally \" Hot Oil\" Act, to assist the Michigan Commission of Con- servation to administer the State law en- acted last May for the conservation of gas oil resources. The principal duty of the new office will be to check petroleum production in Michigan in order \"to determine whether oil is being produced in accordance with Michigan laws. Violations of the Connally Act will be submitted to the Department of Justice for action.\" President Roosevelt, adds Mr. Ickes, is continuing his efforts to persuade Illinois to enact oil conservation legislation to im- plement the Federal \"Hot Oil \" Act. Mr. Ickes characterised the shutdown of oil production as a \"price-fixing device, the repeated use of which would result in an increased price to consumers of gaso- line [petrol] and other petroleum pro- ducts. It is in no way a conservation measure.\" TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA CUTS The Texas Railroad Coinmission has called a meeting for 11th September to consider its proposal to reduce the State's September production of crude oil by 175,000 barrels daily. Production would thus be fixed at 15 per cent. below the U.S. Bureau of Mines' allocation of 1,408,000 barrels daily. Oklahoma is to enforce a reduction in crude oil production of 43,000 barrels daily when the wells in the State are reopened to-morrow, fixing the September allowable output at 384,000 barrels, as against the 428,000 prevailing for several months. The entire Mid-Continent field is now virtually on the crude price basis in force before the shutdowns of oil .wells. Oil Share Market Page 3 CoL 7",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT JOHANNESBURG, 31st August. To the Gold Producers' Committee of the Tiransvaal Chamber of Mines- representing the mining houses and gold-mining industry generally-the Union Government's proposal to ap- propriate all proceeds from the reali- sation of gold above 150s per fine ounce appears to be detrimental both to Witwatersrand interests and the whole country. A statement to this effect was made by the committee this afternoon. It says that the proposal came as a complete surprise to it. If put into effect, the proposal will constitute a radical departure from the Govern- ment's previous policy. A detailed statement of the committee's views on the matter is suspended until there has been an opportunity for discus- sion with the Government. A special session of the Union Parlia- ment-opening on Saturday at Cape Town -has been convened because of the inter- national situation. The appropriation proposal will not be submitted then, but will await the next ordinary session, which will possibly open in February. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The following statement was issued to-day by the Department of Finance, Pretoria, in amplification of the Finance Minister's declaration of yesterday:- Owing to the weakening of sterling and the consequent sharp rise in the sterling price of gold, it has been neces- sary for the Government to consider the effect of this change on the position of the Union of South Africa. It is not considered desirable in the present disturbed conditions to sever the link between the South African pound and sterling. The present abnormal rise in the price of gold is likely to cause speculation which, superimposed on the present international situation, will be harmful to the interests of the Union of South Africa. In these circumstances the Government are of the opinion that the higher yield of gold should be used to meet inevitable difficulties in the posi- tion of the country. In order to restrict such undesirable speculation and to preserve excess profits for national purposes the Govern- ment intend at the next ordinary session of Parliament to seek power to appro- priate, apart from present gold-mining taxation, the whole of the proceeds above Â£7 10s per fine ounce. MINING OPINION In mining financial circles it is said that one outstanding feature of the rise in the price of gold was the potential increase in ore reserves because of the possibility of mining lower-grade ore, but this has been nullified by the fact that the highest calcu- lations would have to be based on 150s per ounce value. That point, however, might not in itself be sufficient to outweigh all other considerations. On the basis of 13,000,000 ozs annually at a price of 160s an ounce, it is computed that the Government would obtain Â£6,500,000, but it is pointed out that a con- siderable proportion of this amount would already be payable in the way of taxation. A further comment is that the Govern- ment took credit-to which it was not really entitled-for reducing grade, thereby enabling an increased tonnage to be mined, with a consequent increase in employment and extension of the life of the industry. But now, it is contended, the Government turns round and says to the mining industry: \" You cannot take advan- tage of any increase in the price of gold beyond 150s an ounce.\" This, it is said, is inconsistency.",

The Chairman states that as a result of legotiations with the company's American creditors, Philadelphia Storage Battery Conmpany and its associates in the U.S.A., the full discharge of debts amounting to Â£77,114 has been secured by the payment i cash of Â£50,000. The company's bankers have agreed to make temporary advances to provide the necessary cash for the debt settlement and for additional funds to inance new work.

Business in Mining markets drifted virtually to a standstill after lunch when the evacuation plans and the decision to close the Stock Exchange to-morrow (Friday) until further notice became known. Prices, especially of Gold shares, were widened and lowered on small end-Account clearing up operations. Base-metal issues remained fairly steady. Kaffirs opened with a dull tone on the Union Government's gold decision announced in this morning's issue Quotations at the close were largely nominal in many instances, although only a handful of shares fell by more than A.

A number of West Australians declined, but elsewhere Mysore were raised 6d and Oriental Consolidated marked up 2s 6d, the latter on the stockholders' acceptance of the Japanese Government's offer for the company's properties.

   "text_content" : "Kaffirs generally opened on the dull side under the influence of the South African Government's proposal to ap- propriate all proceeds from the gold sales of the Rand mines above 150s per ounce, as announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES this morning. Actually very little selling was pre- cipitated, it being generally hoped that this move by the Union Govern- ment is no more than a temporary emergency measure dictated by the exceptional circumstances of the moment. There was little market dis- cussion of the measure, dealers being generally preoccupied with the inter- national situation. After lunch business came virtually to a standstill with the announcement of the evacuation plans and the conse- quent decision to close the Stock Ex- change to-morrow (Friday) until further notice. As this made to-day the close of the Account, some small clearing-up operations were in pro- gress, but even these were not always easy to accomplish. Prices were generally widened and marked down. Arbitrage with Johan- nesburg rarely got beyond the squar- ing up of existing positions, and the same could be said of spasmodic deal- ings with Paris. It was presumed that both these centres will be open to-morrow (Friday). Gold was 6d higher at 159s per ounce. W. HOLDINGS FLUCTUATE Western Holdings were bid for at 12s 6d in the early dealings on the rich borehole strike made in the course of joint drilling with African and European as detailed in these columns this morning. Subse- quently, Holdings relapsed with the rest of the market to close 9d down on balance at lls 6d. African and European held at 1%. Lydenburg weakened 3d to 2s 3d..

Com- pany has not declared an interim, so that the anticipated dividend will be for the full twelve months. Cambrian-It is rather late in the day to seek advice. Nobody can foretell what will happen, but peace would result in a sharp rise and if you are prepared to take a chance you had better keep. In any case you could not sell while Stock Exchange is closed. Dollars-For the present it is only necessary to register as the owner of these American shares. Your broker will obtain the neces- sary form. Kelvin-Whichever way the course of events may go, these shares should prove satisfac tory holdings, particularly Distillers as the company is a large manufacturer of indus- trial spirit. Kingheath -We would suggest spreading your interests by the inclusion of Ariston and Bibiani rather than averaging the shares named. K. T. M. K.-No useful information is avail able concerning D. Smith & Sons since the last report and circular of committee advising reconstruction of Board. Imme diate prospects of concern are dubious. Better hold as you could only expect a few pence each for the shares at present. L. F.-Dividends of 18 per cent., have been distributed in recent years on the partly- paid shares of Hambros Bank. Last year earnings equalled 40 per cent. The Â£10 shares with Â£2 10s paid up stand about Â£8 and so yield is over 51 per cent. Reef--We regard these as too much of a speculation in current circumstances. San Remo-East Daggafontein, which started production at the end of June, is nearest the dividend stage. Palmietkuil has yet to raise the necessary money for the erection of a treatment plant. Vlakfontein has only just started actual development, so its rich ness or otherwise has still to be proved. It is possible that the last two as the most speculative of the trio might show the greatest recovery in more settled markets. We prefer the first-named in current circumstances. The present intention is to close the Stock Exchange for three or four days only. The level of prices on re-open- ing would, of course, be dictated by events. Tulip-By procedure mentioned the money as represented by the investment would be- come automatically the sole property of your wife. It is usual to describe for registration purposes a married woman as \" wife of . .\" Deed of gift would be unnecessary. Letters to the Editor are unavoidably crowded out",

It is rather difficult to disentangle work of this kind from general commerce and industry. Certain of the weekly data are also either missing or distorted by the present abnormalities. The increase in the note circulation also does not for the most part represent addi- tional spending, and allowance has had to be made for this. \"THE FINANCIAL TIMES\" WEEKLY INDEX OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY (1933-35=100) July o Week Wky.I Moving 1933...... 95.8 96.1 ended Index average 1934...... 99.0 99.3 - -- - 1935...... 104.7 105.0, a Ia b 1936...... 111.9 112.2 1939- 1 1937 ......116.6 116.9 6th July 120.2116.9 118.2 1938 ...... 106.6 107.3 131h 1121.6 118.4,119.4 - - - 20th 1115.7 117.9118.5 1938- 127th .114.5 118.0118.3 Aug. .... 104.0 109.3 3rd Aug. 117.3 117.3117.6 ept..... 104.2 107.210th 122.0 117.4 119.3 Oct. .... 110.9 109.2117th ,, 111.0 116.2 119.7 Nov. ..... 109.3 107.6 24lth 113.2115.9121.0 De. ... 110.6,107.031st ,114.0115.0121.7 1939- .Inn. .... 108.6'107.6 Feb. 110.9 112.2 Mar. .... 113.1 111.0 April ...... :116.3 114.1 May ..... 118.1 117.6 June .... 114.9 116.61 July ...... 118.7 119.0: a Actual figures. b\" Smoothed \" to eliminate seasonal changes. Still, as the rather higher figure for the smoothed average shows, the upward trend of business is maintained, though largely because Government orders have more than offset some falling off in civilian busi- ness. This week railway goods traffics and Customs receipts showed an improve- ment and provincial bank clearings were well maintained. There was a drop in cotton deliveries. Reports from industrial centres are also good, except for some natural crisis disturbances. In Lancashire, production in the cotton trade is maintained at a high level, but new business has been deterred by current events.",

   "text_content" : "URING recent months a great deal of thought and technical skill have been devoted to the air-raid shelters which have been, and are still being, erected in vast numbers. Like all other manufactured products, air-raid shelters are good, bad and indifferent, but the bad ones usually deserve to be so described for the simple reason that insufficient money is available for them. It will be of interest in this article to describe one of the very best types of such shelters, on the construction of which money has been expended as would be ex- pected, for this particular shelter is planned in association with a block of luxury flats. This is not to say, however, that any of the fitments are extravagant or wasteful, for this is far from being the case. This scheme provides for the minimum which is essential and no more but this minimum includes so many com- plicated machines and 'scientific imple- ments that their manufacture and assembl age in a limited space is a costly matter. The architects, Howard Leicester and Partners, who have made an intensive study of air-raid shelters on the Con- tinent and are intimate with the latest practice in this country, had to solve the problem of providing a shelter tc accommodate 96 people in a basement which had a height of 10 ft 6 ins under beams and a considerable number of heat- ing and other service pipes running under the beams. The designers arrived at a 2 ? NVIEW OF 23 # BUILDING 11Tl A.R.P. FEATURE standby generating plant, water services and warning equipment. These have been so designed that they can be worked by people without technical knowledge. The gas filtration plant consists of two separate filter and fan units, capable of absorbing any known war gas, driven by an electric motor off the main electric supply, so arranged that in the event of failure this could immediately be changed over on to the emergency generating plant by a switch situated in the warden's room. As a third standby these plants can each be worked by one person, through cycle- operated drives. This operation is com- paratively easy and requires only a moderately slow rate of pedalling and could be worked for hours by people in short shifts. Fresh air is drawn in through louvred openings in the blast-proof screens situated at ground level by a suitable concrete and metal duct to the plant, and is there puri- fied. From each plant fresh air distribut- ing ducts are taken along at high level with openings to each of the various compart- ments. thus ensuring even distribution over the whole shelter. For the removal of the ISOMETRIC DRAWING OF AIR-RAID SHELTER IN WEST END BLOCK OF FLATS Architects: Howard Leicester and Partners FIRST-AID ROOM IN A WEST END AIR-RAID SHELTER Architects: Howard Leicester and Partners form which could be described as a homo- geneous concrete box construction within the' existing steel structure. The construction of ceiling and floor was designed on a super load of 400 lbs pei foot. It means that the collapsing ten- storey building would not destroy the A.R.P. shelter. The floor slab is reinforced so that it could take the whole weight ol the collapsing building and distribute the load without rupture of the concrete shell Reinforced concrete walls were also- buill independent and additional to the existing structure and generally 9 ins thick. The most difficult task was to gel sufficient inside height and to design the ceiling and floor construction for the weight of the collapsing building. The mechanical services may be grouped in four categories:-Ventilation plant - vitiated air, non-return exhaust valves are i fitted, so that a slight pressure is main- tained in the shelter, thus preventing any i increase of contaminated air. One is r situated in the generating plant chamber, - and the other in the lavatories; both these ' discharge to atmosphere through suitable I trunking, terminating at ground level. r The emergency generating plant is auto- matic in operation, so that whenever a failure occurs on the main electric supply, t the petrol engine will start up immediately, r which, in turn, lights a pilot lamp in the warden's room, thus giving the signal for t the change-over switch to be brought in the a down position. This operation connects a all the various services on to the emer- gency plant. Also, on restoration of the I main electric supply, the plant will auto- mnticallv nft nnt. 1Â· I t a Â£ r I v ENTRANCE TO AIR-RAID SHELTER IN A WEST END BLOCK OF FLATS t I f i I c (1 I t I t t I f i I c (1 I t I t A compiete water service is proviaea in the shelter, with special ozonators fdr purifying the water to the basins in the first aid room. Hot and cold showers are provided in the ablution room for the purpose of decontamination, and a further cold water supply to the lavatories. A cold water service is also taken to the corridor where a sink is provided, over which an electric kettle is fitted. These services in the normal way are supplied from the main tanks which serve the flats, and a suitable pressure gauge is provided in the warden's room indicating when the services are in working order. Should, however, a breakdown occur, it would immediately be apparent to the warden by those gauges, and by operating the necessary valves the water services are changed over to the emergency supply, which consists of a 1,500-gallon tank, situated within the shelter. This tank is fitted with an indicator showing the amount of water in the tank, and operat- ing an automatic warning when a certain low level has been reached. Regarding the warning equipment, two special loud-speakers are provided in the courtyard which are controlled by a special transmittiing set fixed in the warden's room. This will give the \" alarm \" and also the \" all clear\" signal to the tenants, and also, by the operation of a small switch, definite instructions can be broadcast by the warden. Further, a loud-speaker is provided in the porter's room, so that communication will always be maintained from the shelter to the porter. When the shelter is in occupation a loud- speaker is provided at the end of the corridor by which the warden can issue the various instructions, and also relay any wireless programme desired. The warden's room also contains controls and switches and is the directive centre for the whole of the main building and the shelter in time of air raid. The main doors to the shelter are heavy blastproof doors, made by Garton and Thorne, with rubber contact against the frame, and are easily opened and shut by a spindle and wheel. Special note should be taken of these doors, which are con- sidered to be some of the finest in the country. The Norris Warming Company was re- sponsible for the mechnical plant and AIR.RAID WARDEN'S POST SHOWING INTERCOMMUNICATION AND BROAD. CASTING EQUIPMENT equipment. The communication system has been installed by Ardente Acoustic Laboratories. This air raid shelter reflects the greatest credit upon the company and also upon the architects, Howard Leicester and Partners, F./A.R.I.B.A., of 3, Ports- mouth-street, W.C.2, and the engineer, Mr. A. Justicz. It is to be hoped that as many people as possible will soon be provided with such good protection from aircraft ntto.ok"
