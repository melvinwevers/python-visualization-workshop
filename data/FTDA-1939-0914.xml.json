The principal topic of conversation in Lombard Street was the possibility of a reduction in Bank Rate to-morrow. Opinion on the subject was divided, but the majority view seemed to be that there will be no change as yet. Pending the decision, however, business in dis- counts is affected to the extent that market houses are less keen to sell bills. The clearing banks were again asking for bills, their rates for October paper being 3-3', per cent., for November maturities 3% per cent. and Decembers at :!: per cent., but lower rates were some- times conceded in an attempt to attract sellers. An outside demand for the \" hot\" Treasury bill was reported at ;3, per cent. Short loans were in plentiful supply, accommodation against bills being freely obtainable at 3 per cent: and against bonds at down to 2'. per cent. in outside quarters. .t ..

The fall in silver prices was sharply reversed, spot being ;sld up at 21,\",d per ounce and forward delivery \";d at 21',(l per ounce. The principal development in the foreign exchange market was the further apprecia tion in Swiss francs, the rate being lowered 10 centimes to 17.74Ã½j%. By a curious coincidence, the Oslo rate was lowered to a similar extent to the same quotation, while Swedish kronor gained 10 points at li.87:. and Belgian belgas 20 centimes at 23.4.5. The U.S. dollar rate was unchanged again at $4.04. but Canadian dollars hard- ened 2 cents to $4.41. OFFI('IAL Q UOITAT IONS S201 3 Spt..12thl, et.. 20/9/ 3i 1939 1939 N.Y.T.'r....l(1 i lDlI.

   "text_content" : "Fron OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 13th Sept. A nervous tone was apparent in the Stock Market. After considerable irregu- larity in early dealings, a rallying ten dency developed following the news that President Roosevelt had called a special session of Congress for 21st September. The resultant gains, however, were not maintained, and the session ended with light but persistent selling. The final list showed net changes of fractions to $2 in both directions, the closing tone being easy. Turnover totalled 3,760,000 shares, against 4,170,000 yesterday. The opening was firm and active. The pace subsequently slowed down, but the undertone du'ing the morning was unde- cided. Some of the recent strong spots met with recurrent waves of profit-taking and buying interest switched to the recently backward groups, notably Utili- ties and Mail Order shares. At midday Steels, Coppers and Minings were up to 3i points lower, but gains in Mail Orders extended to 2 points. In the early afternoon the market rallied. Steels moved slightly above their previous lows, and Rails kept firm despite an estimate that this week's freight load- ings will show a decline of 6(0,000 cars. Good support was given to Utilities and Merchandisings, but Coppers were under pressure. War stocks finally sank to the day's lows, with American Can, U.S. Smelting, Youngstown Sheet and U.S. Steel particularly heavy. The I)ow-.Jones Industrials closing average fell 1.82 to 154.10, and Rails reacted 0.28 to :32.57, but Utilities rose 0.22 to 2.1.:0. Dealings covered 976 stocks, of which 415 improved, 411 declined and 150 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Governments eased and Railroads were irregular; bond sales totalled $16,480,000, against $22,020,000 yesterday. __ Â·Â· Â· Â· .Â·Â·. Â· t I I I 1 1' 1 r F t Sterling closed 2!\",c down at $4.01. Silver rallied 'Ã½c to 36`,-c per ounce. Moody's cniommodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1!31--_100) was to-day 1(i7.9, against 1(7.5 yesterday. Evidence that the Administration for the time beirn is not contemiplating any steps to halt the rise in commodity prices is seen in President Roosevelt's remarks that cotton is still too low, and that wheat could go at least to $1.16 per bushel with- out hurting consumers. On the other hand, the President said he was watching copper, which could be produced profitably it 12.50i) per pound, and that he was determined not to permit an advance similar to that of world war days. The Maritime Commission has asked for tenders for a further 20 cargo vessels to cost $35,000,000 to $40,000,000. Twenty new vessels are under construction. The Commission has ordered a total of about 100 ships since the beginning of its pro- gramme of rehabilitating the nation's merchant marine. American Rolling Mill dividend on the Four and a-Half per Cent. Cumulative Preferred stock is $1.25, payable 1(th October to holders of 15th September. This leaves arrears of $4.37, per share; previous phyment was $1.12% in July, 19:'8. Western Union net loss for seven months to 31st July, $481,909 (loss $1,818,941 year ago).

   "text_content" : "Rightly, or wrongly, I gathered the impression yesterday that business had further slackened. The virtual completion by midday of selling to provide for next Thurs- day's special Settlement deprived markets of a certain stimulus to deal- ings. It has often this week been easier to find a buyer of shares offered at what appeared bargain prices than to tempt out stock of which there was no immediate supply in the market. Bank Rate All eyes will turn to the Trans-Lux at 11.45 this morning on the off- chance of a reduction in Bank Rate from 4 to 3 or 31 per cent. Actually the betting yesterday afternoon was 10-1 against any alteration to-day, but if the official announcement should be delayed for 10 minutes or so the odds will probably come down. I hear it argued that if gilt-edged stocks are to become readily saleable then either the existing minima or Bank Rate will have to be reduced. War Loan and Old Consols are at present nominally quoted on approxi- mately a 4 per cent. basis. Base Metals Mining shares enjoyed a fair amount of selective demand. Tins were strongly bid for, partly by Singa- pore, on the jerking-up of the export quota for the current quarter to 80 per cent., against an average in the twelve mouths ended last March of 472 per cent. This should mean a big increase in Malayan producers' rate of profits. For the moment, however, the posi- tion as regards base-metal mines remains confused by the suspension of dealings on the London Metal Ex- change. Even tin, which hitherto has been free, is now under a ban until, anyway, next Monday. The world price has been getting out of hand and seemingly some form of control by the American and British authorities is under consideration. Meanwhile, there are no public dealings in London in copper, tin, lead or zinc. Technical matters are delaying a settlement of immediate pre-war con- tracts. As soon as these have been agreed, dealings will be resumed. There is disappointment at the re- ported maximum London prices of Â£46 per ton for standard copper and Â£51 for electrolytic. In peace time Â£45 would have been considered a very satisfactory average for standard copper, but it may be doubted whether an extra Â£1 to cover war insurance, etc., is sufficient. Marriage-Brokers? It is to be hoped that in current cir- cumstances there will be no attempt to enforce too strictly the new rule (88A) passed last January which provided that \" in all cases a member must be prepared to justify\" the executior of an order with a non-member. Of recent months brokers have been very nervous of dealing otherwise than through jobbers in case of bring- ing themselves, however innocently, under the above regulation. Even yesterday a firm with a buying and a selling order in the same Mining shares was very doubtful whether he was entitled to marry the dealers. Jobbers were not at all helpful, quoting too wide prices to make either the sale or the purchase prac- ticable within the limits set by the two clients. The broker himself could have easily arranged a happy marriage for at least part of the would-be seller's shares. b71 iiaurisal",

   "text_content" : "Cycle manufacturers are experiencing a record demand for their products. Restricted travel facilities are causing a large number of people to turn to the bicycle as an alternative means of locomo- tion. Makers of cycles are working to capacity, but even so they cannot keep up with demand. Supplies of raw materials are a little difficult to arrange in some instance, but the manufacturers' big handicap is lack of transport. A feature of past business in cycles has been the extensive use of hire purchase facilities. With the present tendency to restrict operations in this direction much of the future trade will be on a cash basis.",

   "text_content" : "WEDNESDAY Evening. Nothing occurred to-day to infuse fresh life into Stock Exchange dealing. Markets have had a listless appear- ance, and the tone has been dull. One reason put forward for the absence of activity is the closing of outstanding positions and completion of any necessitous selling, leaving little attraction in prices for the bargain hunter. The dulness of many prices was evi- dently due to taxation fears, and to the belief that yields generally will require upward adjustment. The total of bargains marked in all markets. was 2,549, against 2,434 yester- day. Quotations for British Funds remained at their minimum figures. Only Consols 2% per cent. stood at a slightly higher level, and changed hands from the mini- mum of 62 to 62%. Markings of business in other Govern- ment stocks were even nearer to the minima than they were yesterday, and the market had a smaller amount of business to handle. The easier trend and the absence of de- mand were due partly to declining hopes of a reduction in Bank Rate. Corporation and Dominion stocks were changing hafrds occasionally at and just above fixed prices. Australian 5 per cent., 1945-75, were among the most active, business being marked from the minimum of 95 up to 96'%. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4. FOREIGN BONDS QUIET Foreign bond dealers experienced a falling off in business to-day. German bonds, in which bear positions outstandine at the outbreak of hostilities now appear to be largely closed, were marked down slightly. The 5 per cent. and the 4% per cent. issues both closed ' lower at 8% and 6 respectively. Chileans changed hands, but on a smallei scale than yesterday and closing quota- tions were unchanged. The Argentine loans again provided the firmest features Buying inquiry based on an optimistic reading of the country's position as a fooc supplier continued. The 4 per cent. 193! issue gained 1 point to 83 and the 3% per cent. and 4 ee per cent. Conversion descrip- tions also made small headway. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 ARG. RAILS ADVANCE In the absence of the traffic figures which used to create some interest or Wednesdays in peace time, the Home Rail- way market passed a quiet day. There were again few buyers in evidence at the fixed minimum prices ruling for the prior charges, and the Ordinary stocks showec a weak tendency. This position suggests that the whole market might at present find a lower level if it were decontrolled Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary lost 4 points to 50' And Great Westerr Ordinary shed 1 to 23'/. In the Foreign list the Argentine issues attracted attention. B.A.G.S. 5 per cent Preference made further headway to 2E and Central Argentine 6 per cent, Ordinary gained 2% points and also closed at 25. Antofagasta, following the recent rise in Chilean bonds, were also in demand and closed / to the good at 8%. Other Foreign Rails showed a firm in- clination. San Paulo advanced % to 23 and United Railways of Havana were quoted at 2 as compared with % pre- viously. American Railroad stocks made further advances on the day, but closed for the most part a little below the best, buyina declining in the later hours of business, Thus New York Central were 1% to the good at 23, after being 23%. AtchisonE were finally 2 up at 35. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS REALISED Public Enterprise Checked by Taxation Outlook Business in the Industrial market was on a scale more restricted than ever and the general tone continued dull. Taxation fears again weighed heavily on many shares and brought in a few sellers. In- quiry for shares was limited to a few specialities and had no effect upon the tendency, which on the whole was un- favourable. Brewery descriptions were outstanding in their weakness and the downward movement in Tobacco shares persisted. Shipping shares shed part of their recent strength. In the BANKING section some selling of \"Big Five \" issues was in progress and in absence of ready buyers quotations were lowered further. Martins (partly paid) eased % to 7% and Barclays \" A \" to 8%. Barclays \"B \" receded 3s to 62s 6d and Westminsters 2s id to 67s. Hongkong and Shanghai were 2 points down at 75. Further sharp declines occurred in INSURANCE shares. These were more a readjustment of market values to bring yields into line with present-day standards.- Prudential \" A\" and Pearl were each a point lower. A similar readjustment was responsible for further recessions among ELECTRIC SUPPLY shares. County of London closed 2s 6d weaker at 30s, while City of London fell 2s to 26s. ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS failed to attract buyers. English Electrics were realised again and closed Is 6d weaker at 30s. Crompton Parkinson \" A \" changed at 16s.. Dealings in British Electric Trac- tion Deferred ranged from 600 to 667%. Braz. Tractions opened at 7% and shot up to 8%, shading off to 8% at the close. Fresh recessions took place in MOTOR shares and Rolls-Royce and Austin issues were each 2s 6d down. Fords reacted is 3d to 15s. Associated Equipments changed at 29s 6d. Raleigh Holdings were bought and a fair business passed up to 46s 3d, but the price finished 45s 3d. AIR- CRAFTS were neglected, and Faireys were is lower at los aa. Ine only interesting movement in COMPONENTS was a rally of Is 3d to 30s 7%d in Triplex Glass. While a fair demand was experienced, SHIPPING shares were disposed to become easier towards the close. A few sellers came in. Cairn Lines were strong and left off Is higher at 7s, after changing at 7s 9d, Coast Lines were good, changing up to 13s 9d. Court Lines were 15s and Union-Castles 12s rather buyers. Cunards finished easier at 4s 9d. Little was going on in IRON and STEEL shares and the tendency was easier. Out- side the domestic group, Indian Irons jumped 2s 6d further to 55s. Imperial Smeltings, on the zinc position, were 9d higher at 11s. Low-priced TEXTILES attracted moderate attention, but improvements were limited to 3d per share and even less. RAYONS closed on a weak note, with Courtaulds Is down at 28s. British Celanese were offered and the First Preference relapsed is to 16s 6d, while the Seconds were down Is 6d to 10s. American and Canadian were easier. Among CHAIN STORES, business in Woolworths was recorded between 50s 7%d and 54s 4'd'(1. Marks and Spencers and Great Universals were each is 3d lower. The downward movement continued in the BREWEKY section and declines ranged up to 6s 3d in Hewitt Brothers. Guinness and Watney Deferred lost 5s apiece. TOBACCOS suffered further losses, notably Carreras \"A,\" which fell ' to 5%. Gallahers were down % to 5% and Im- perials 'in to 5' ,. Higher prices were quoted for leading American Industrials. U.S. Steels were 3% stronger at 93:,. Bethlehems were 105, General Motors t64% and Chryslers 106. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 FRESH RISE IN OILS Investors continued to be attracted to the OIL market by the belief that war con- ditions must bring the industry an increase in consumption. Interest was fairly wide- spread throughout the market, but busi- ness was limited by the difficulty still found in dealing. The insistence on cash transactions precluded jobbers dealing beyond the scope of their books, and this fact frequently caused shares to improve to an extent hardly warranted by the business done. Royal Dutch continued their steady advarnce and, at 42, were at their highest of the year and equal to last year's best price. The recent strength of the shares has been due to Amsterdam buying and to exchange adjustments. Shells rose %. to 4',,, but finally were Â¼: under the best at 4-%. The Eagle issues showed further im- provement, both Mexicans and Canadians closing 9d higher, and there was continued support for Trinidad and South American descriptions. Among the latter, Lobitos were in good demand and closed s higher at 1'\",, rather buyers. Trinidad Petroleum Developments were prominent with a rise of 2s to 50s. Oil Prices Page 4 RUBBERS IRREGULAR Quieter conditions prevailed in the Rubber share market to-day. Buyers of some shares were still in evidence, but selling developed in other cases, and prices moved irregularly. The commodity re- mained steady during Stock Exchange hours at 10d per pound bid against 10'd yesterday. The best share market feature was Grand Central, which was said to be bought as a lock-up. The price rose a further Is 3d to 12s 6d. Tamiang. also in fair demand, put on another 7';d at 21s 3d, while Sungei Batu were firmer at 20s in comparison with 18s 9d yesterday. United Serdang were 3d dearer at 3s 6d, but Djasinga were rather offered and fell Is Sd to 11s 3d. .In Mincinh Lane the Rubber share market was quietly steady, with Rubber Trust 28s 6d and Anglo-Dutch 27s 6d. Allied changed hands at 17s 6d and North Malay at Is 8/,d. Stock Exchange prices for Tea shares were dull. Stock was said to be in process of realisation in order to take up contango positions in other markets. Amalgamated. however, were good at 15s 7.d, against 15s yesterday, and Consolidated Estates rose 6d to 33s. Jokai, on the other hand, were sold and fell 2s to 25s 6d. An announcement regarding the Govern- ment and tea prices appears on Page Three. Rubber and Tea share prices Page 4 KAFFIRS ABOVE WORST Tin Shares Strong-North Broken Hill Up Kaffirs were again mainly lower on balance, but after a dull opening the ten- dency improved towards two o'clock. Some local and Cape demand was reported. Selling as the result of the closing up of contango positions was thought to be on the wane. Consequently, some of those non-producers which have been marked down particularly sharply of late were able to show gains on the day, and several others left off above the worst. A vague rumour toyed with the hope of some re- vision of South Africa's policy of a 150s maximum for gold. West Wits. were unchanged at 3, after 2,4 nominal, and Venterspost at 1%, after i0/. Libanon rallied 9d to 7s 6d, Western Reefs '/M to 't (after ') and Western Holdings 6d to 8s 9d. Of the producers, Sub Nigel, Geduld, East Geduld and Crown all lost %. Diamonds remained delpressed. De Beers Deferred fell % to 5% and the Preference ' to 8)'. West Africans again experienced some selective demand in a rather larger turn- over. Good features were Taquah and Abosso. ' up at 1\".,, and Bibiani, Is 6d higher at 28s 6d. Ashanti weakened ', to 3%,. Changes in other Gold shares were generally unimportant. Of Indians, Nundydroog gave way '/ to 1%. Rhodesian Coppers encountered a further moderate amount of profit-taking. Some disappointment was expressed at the absence of any indication that the sug- gested maximum price of Â£46 for standard copper might possibly be revised in an upward direction. Rhokana fell another % to 13. Exceptionally, Rhodesian Selec- tion were again in demand, and gained 9d to 17s 3d. The increase in the tin quota brought in more support for the shares partly from the East. Stock was again difficult to obtain even at higher levels. Petaling jumped %, to \"'Â¾, as did Tronoh to 1%, and Tekka-Taiping to Â¼. Southern Malayan spurted 3s 3d to 22s. Several Nigerians went ahead. Mawchi gained 9d to 32s 6d. Demand for the Barriers continued un- abated among Lead-Zincs. Zinc Ordinary rose m to 3Â¼, the Pref. '. to 6%6 and North Broken Hill \"i, to 2'/. Elsewhere. Burma Corpn. were lowered 6d to 9s 6d.

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange business remains quiet, but markets are in a highly sensitive condition. Any favourable news from one or other of the fronts would immediately exert a powerful influence upon prices. The South African market is still suffering from the effects of attempted liquidation of stale bull accounts. In other markets, discrimination of the order to which reference was made yesterday-that is to say. in the selec- tion of shares in companies concerned with essential commodities-oil, sugar and so forth-is evident in several directions. Floating supplies have been practically absorbed: with cash dealings, each fresh demand serves to strengthen the quotations. There are, goodness knows, only too many stocks and shares which are unsalable, but any news of reversal to the German arms would inflame, prudently or otherwise, general im- provement all round. Good Oil Shares \" What to buy in the Oil market? \" Shell Transport 91s 3d; Trinidad Leaseholds 88s 6d; Trinidad Petro- leum 50s. And with these, you cannot go far wrong. West Africans The West African group is not troubled by efforts to square a stale bull account. While Kaffirs are dull, West Africans respond to the favour- able outlook evidenced by the price of gold. Either this month or next, the Gold Coast Main Reef will be added to the number of West African pro- ducers. Early in the new year the company should be in full production. The consulting engineer of the Amalgamated Banket Areas is on the point of sailing-if he has not already gone-for the Amalgamated's pro- perty. Such shares as Ariston, Marlu, Gold Coast Main Reef are among those to which the speculator in Mining shares should pay attentive heed. A purchase of any of them should turn out profitably. Copper and Tin What is going to happen in the Metal market is a problem that arouses keen interest. It affords a variety of choice for theories. Rhodesian copper companies, for instance, will depend for their profits upon the decision that is expected to be reached immediately in the Metal market. Tin' shares benefit even more by the increase in the quota, announced yesterday, than would have been the case if the con- trolled price of tin were brought into line with the American quotation. This uncertainty makes the offer of any sort of counsel or suggestion fairly dangerous at present, and accounts for the cautious disposition shown by the market in the principal Copper shares. Mobilisation The Bank of England has taken on a colossal task in accepting registration of the American and other securities of which particulars are required by the Government, but the work pro- ceeds with the smoothness for which the Bank of England is renowned. Red tape has been cut to a minimum. The Bank is helpful and co-operative. About another fortnight remains for the work to be completed. Those people who have not yet complied with the requisition may be reminded that the common cause will be assisted if they do not leave everything to the last minute.",

   "text_content" : "The accelerated rhythm of many classes of industry in war-time implies a potential need for new capital, but it is not universally realised that capital, like so many other commodities, is now subject to strict control. The Govern- ment, on behalf of the nation, has the first call upon all resources for the prosecution of the war. The latter phrase may be given the widest inter- pretation, but some types of activity must have priority when it comes to allocating either materials or money. Therefore money, in the form of capital for businesses of all kinds, or for other borrowers, can only be obtained with the consent of the Treasury. The utilisation of the Foreign Transactions Advisory Com- mittee (of which Lord Kennet is chairman) to advise upon the larger questions now involved is a guarantee that applicants will meet with no factious opposition. It must be remembered, however, that the guiding principle laid down for that body under its new title of Capital Issues Committee is that only new issues \" advisable in the national interest\" can be allowed. It is im- possible to draw any hard and fast line between the eligible -and the in- eligible, although many industries which seem to have a prima facie claim come immediately to mind. En- gagement upon war work and the con- duct or maintenance of essential services are qualifications which appear to give a title to first considera- tion. Even these definitions are so elastic as to make it evident that every case must be considered on its merits in the light of the principle enunciated above and of the state of the capital market as it may develop in the days to come. What has been said so far relates to the raising of new money from the public, but the control extends still further afield. Borrowing, in the ex- pectation of replacing the loan by a stock issue, comes within its scope. An impression in some quarters that all issues of securities \" for cash or otherwise \" are subject to control is a little wide of the mark, but there are very few exceptions. Splitting or con- solidation of existing shares, for in- stance, were allowed by the original Treasury order if no new cash was in- volved, as was an exchange of shares on amalgamation (with minor provisos). Replacement of maturing obligations, on the other hand, is definitely within the control scheme, although entitled to special consideration. In a word, there are few cases involving the issue of securities of any kind, by private or by public companies or others, which do not now require Treasury aiproval. Unless there is a clear exemption, the only course which will ensure that no offence is com- mitted under the regulations is to submit the requisite application to the Committee.",

   "text_content" : "In this the golden jubilee year of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company the sterling price of gold has scaled new heights. Its effect on the profits of the Rand producing mines in which the company is interested can hardly fail to be beneficial in spite of the decision of the Union Government to appropriate to itself the great part of the extra premium on the metal re- sulting from the war. If this should enable larger dividends to be paid it will go some way to offset the disad- vantage of restricted markets and lack of opportunities to transact profitable share dealings, a factor which in the past year contributed to the decline in Johnnies earnings. Net profits for the year were down from Â£720,400 to Â£616,100, but as usual the receipts from the various sources of income are not shown separately. The 15 per cent. dividend has been maintained with a surplus of Â£23,600, which brings the carry-forward up to Â£220,300. This is a useful reserve to have in addition to the general fund of Â£3,050,000. The company's invest- ments, which include interests in Rhodesia.n copper and in diamonds as well as gold, are nearly Â£400,000 lower at Â£5,989,000, although the market value continues to be substantially in excess of that figure. That reduction is made up in other directions, notably by the appearance in the balance-sheet of Â£249,300 South African Treasury bills in addition to more than a million of cash. At 35s the Â£1 shares yield over 8J per cent. on a 15 per cent. divi- dend basis.",

   "text_content" : "Steady progress continues to be made in equipping and opening up the property of the Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines. Operations have reached the stage at which it is possible to examine the ore-body with a view to determining the most suit- able mining. Two experimental methods, Mr. S. S. Taylor intimated at yesterday's meeting of the company, have been planned, and the necessary development work is in hand. Before mining can be undertaken, however, it will be necessary to drain completely all the water-bearing strata lying above the ore to be mined. Ore available for mining above the 470-ft level has been provisionally estimated at approximately 3,000,000 short tons averaging 6.86 per cent. copper, of which 2.29 per cent. is sul- phide and 4.57 per cent. oxide. The percentage of oxide is higher than may be anticipated at depth. Until the results from the pilot plant have been considered the design and order- ing of a full scale plant, and therefore the date of large-scale production, can- not be forecast.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Discount rates have fallen away t( an extent which makes the existine Bank Rate largely ineffective. It is th< obvious intention of the authorities tc keep the Money market extremely liquid, but the fine rates ruling fox short-dated paper are due to the re. luctance of market houses to lighten their portfolios. Recouping Losses Discount houses and firms will maintain as large a book as they possibly can in view of the chance that, sooner or later, there will be a fall in Bank Rate. By thus holding on to \"paper\" they will, when the change does occur, recoup, in part at least, some of the loss suffered when the official minimum was raised. Arguments in favour of a cut in Bank Rate include the beneficial effect it would have on the cost of Govern- ment borrowing-short and long-term; the fact that speculation in securities and exchange is absent owing to the regulations; and the consideration that France has not raised her rate. Making-up The decision of the London Clear- ing Bankers to discontinue publication of monthly statements means that there will be no \"making-up\"-or window-dressing. It has long been argued that this is unnecessary; it merely caused needless disturbance and misled nobody. There is no ques- tion of trying to hide facts. The re- noval of the clearing has already caused enough upset. Standstill Bills British and United States creditors some days ago gave notice under Sub-section 2, Clause 2, to terminate the German standstill agreement. The creditors concerned, who hold about 75 per cent. of the total stand- still claims, are now playing a game of hide and seek. Certain American nstitutions sequestrated about 15,000,000 of German gold securities and so on. This seizure, it is believed, was against claims. Both British and American creditors are now busy find- ng the whereabouts of cargoes, etc., n respect of which standstill bills are Irawn. The termination of the agree nent has not unduly strained British acceptance houses.",

   "text_content" : "Mr. Graham Cunningham's very thorough review of the company's position at yesterday's Triplex meet- ing ended, with the assurance that although the production of safety glass for the private car trade has been cut down to -a trifle of output capacity, the factories, increased in number by the \" Lancegaye \" acquisi- tion, are by no means idle. He was not, of course, at liberty to state upon what type of work the company is engaged, but he expressed confidence that at the end of the hostilities \" Triplex Glass \" will still be a house- hold word. The progress of two promising sub- sidiaries has been seriously interfered with by the advent of war. The export of all the products of Quikfit and Quartz has been prohibited by the Board of Trade, while air-raid pre- cautions have killed the demand for the roof lighting specialities of Thermolux. Mr. Cunningham gave an interesting account of the extent and costs of the company's own A.R.P. scheme. It is clear that the company is quickly and efficiently adjusting itself to the tasks of war.",

   "text_content" : "V &JUJiEJlIk Io rill kIriIN MANMN %X Villiers Engineering Company, the Wolverhampton manufacturers of en- gines for small motor-cycles and motorised bicycles, earned smaller profits during the year ended 31st July, a period of difficulty for most businesses. In this particular in- stance the international crisis of last autumn seriously affected trade, especially in the export field. Busi- ness began to pick up later, however, and in the second half of the financial year demand for the company's pro- ductions was so heavy that day and night shifts had to be worked. But for that late recovery profits would not have reached the amount of Â£45,200 shown in the accounts. Although Â£12,600 lower than in the previous year, this result is satisfac- tory in the circumstances, particularly as higher wages bills and other over- heads have had to be met. After allowing Â£11.000 for depreciation, as last time, and the larger sum of Â£7,300 for taxation, the net profit comes out at Â£26,200, as compared with Â£40,700.",

   "text_content" : "Unfavourable market conditions have evidently continued to affect the business of Calthrops, cattle, pig and poultry food manufacturers, during the past year. The reduction in the dividend to 8 per cent., against 10 per cent., is explained by the lower profit of Â£35,000, against Â£43,400, before providing for taxation. The company came out as a public undertaking in 1937, based on the old-established business of Calthrop Brothers, founded in 1896. Its advent coincided with an upward movement in the prices of many essential raw materials. As a result the experience of the financial year ended in June, 1938, was that an increased quantity of manufactures delivered and in- voiced to customers gave a smaller profit per ton. No doubt this situa- tion has persisted during the past 12 months. Certain extensions which were com- pleted after the conclusion of the 1938 trading period were already beginning to show results at the time of the annual meeting a year ago, and it was confidently expected that the volume of business would be maintained. A note of caution was' nevertheless adopted regarding the, profit to be achieved. The company has always taken a modest view of the benefits to be derived from the trade agree- ment with Eire."

If interest rates in general increase the companies may offer more favourable terms for new business, so you might delay making a fresh investment in this direction. A. R.--The report emanated from Holland, but on this side it is not thought that the scheme will be abandoned. Beaumont--You must register as a British owner of the shares. When registered you can sell, if you desire. E. H. R.-We have no information on which we can base an answer to your question regarding this cycle business, but we sug- gest you retain the shares for the report due next month. Iavelock-If obtainable these shares would be a reasonable purchase, but it would be unwise to assume that the dividend of 10 per cent. will be repeated, as much will depend upon the Board's view of the out- look. I. J. L.-1. Messrs. Fraser and Co. have noti- fied us that Singapore prices are nominal. and for the present no quotations are being cabled. 2. We do not know of any journal giving the daily price. Links-Neither of these securities appears to come within the scope of the regulations. Rhyl-1. Decline is due to some uncertainty regarding copper and price likely to be received here for the output, but the shares certainly are worth keeping. 2. Under present conditions much appreciation in these other shares seems unlikely. S. B., Liverpool-We overlooked in our reply on Tuesday the change of address in London office of the \" Wall Street Journal.\" This is now at 85, Fleet-street, E.C.4. Sperans Vivo-1. Outside of Government stocks there are not many really \"safe\" securities offering. It would be better to awaft the Budget and see what effect it will have upon investment shares before invest- ing the sum named. 2. The view applied to Siamese Tins also; would certainly keep these. W., Cleckheaton--We should not sell these three while Stock Exchange dealings are so restricted, but under present conditions capital appreciation is unlikely.",

Within this category would fall the Â£1,000,000 order for locomotives which Turkey placed with Britain. The locomo- tives are under construction and no obstacle will be placed in the way of their delivery. The British locomotive industry generally is now very busy upon civil and military work of national importance. Delivery of the 58 locomotives to Turkey, which normally would begin early next year, will depend upon the priority of work decided upon by the Minister of Supply.",

   "text_content" : "The Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons last night that the Government intended to establish a Ministry of Shipping at an early date. Plans had been in existence for some time past. He said he was satisfied that while the organisation to deal with the shipping problem was being very rapidly expanded there was much to gain in efficiency by retaining the organisation for a further period within the Board of Trade. Asked whether he appreciated that it would be easy to switch over the present organisation to the Ministry of Shipping, Mr. Chamberlain said what he wanted to convey was that the process of expansion would take perhaps a week or two longer, and it would be better, while that expansion was going on, to keep it under the Board of Trade. New rates were fixed yesterday for war risks on cargo out- side the Government scheme. On the Atlantic route they will work to the benefit of American shipowners. At the request of the British Government the London Metal Exchange was closed yesterday; it will not reopen until Monday next or later. No reason for the decision has been given officially, but it is understood to have been occasioned by the anoma- lous conditions affecting dealings in tin. This metal has, in fact, been the only one traded in London since the Exchange reopened on 6th September after the outbreak of war. Dealings in copper, lead and zinc remain sus- pended pending agreement on measures to liquidate pre-war contracts. PRICES IN EAST AND U.S. Big Advances While the official London price for standard tin has been pegged at Â£230 a ton-the upper limit envisaged by the Buffer Pool-prices in the East and in the United States have been soaring. It has thus been possible within the past few days for those with licenses to export to the United States to purchase Chinese metal in the London market and sell in New York at Â£295 a ton. Even in London. English tin has been sold at Â£240 a ton, while Straits metal has been traded at Â£250. This state of affairs is now engaging the attention of the authorities. It is learned that discussions are proceeding between the British and United States Governments, presumably to secure more uniform conditions on the world's markets. Meanwhile, the Eastern market for tin has been shut down. REVISED WAR RISK CARGO RATES BENEFIT TO U.S. A new scale of rates for war risks on cargo other than that coming within the scope of the Government Cargo War Risk Insurance Scheme was issued by the Joint War Risk Rating Committee of Company and Lloyd's Underwriters yesTerday. It comes into force to-day and a feature of it is that it will operate to the benefit of United States shipowners. Whereas in the previous schedule the rate for American coasting trade (Atlantic and Pacific) was 5s per cent., it is now 10s per cent. for British and Allied vessels, a rebate of 50 per cent. of the schedule rate for cargo in neutral vessels, leaving the rate on such cargo unchanged. This will be a great advantage to United States shipowners since it will be an inducement to shippers to send their goods by United States vessels rather than by English or Canadian ships. A flat additional premium of Â£2 per cent. is fixed for all voyages to, from or through the Mediterranean or Black Sea, irrespec- tive of the flag of the carrying vessel, hut in many other trades the rates for British and Allied vessels are reduced in some cases by 50 per cent. and in others by 75 per cent. if the carrying vessel is of neutral flag. The basic rates for voyages to and from the Continent, other than Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Sea ports, remain un- changed, but the application of the new additional premium appears to make the Mediterranean and Black Sea rates slightly lower in some cases. The rates for specie, bonds and securities are, as before, 75 per cent. of the cargo rates.",

   "text_content" : "AVOIDING SHIPM1ENT Although moderate activity continues in American securities, with the object of shipping stocks to New York, Wall Street prices remain considerably above those obtainable by sellers in London. This difference in price, as noted in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on 7th September, is due largely to heavy war-time insurance charges on shipped securities. The cost of insurance varies with the circumstance of the shipment. It is sometimes as high as :3%' per cent. on the value of the securities concerned. This burden, which is in effect borne by British sellers of securities, is considered in many City quarters to be excessive and steps are already being taken to explore plans by which the shipment of securities across the Atlantic may be avoided. If such a scheme could be devised, and shipments from London to New York were no longer necessary, quotations for American stocks in London and New York would approximate much more closely than they have done since the outbreak of war. S.E. SETTLEMENT SPECIAL RULES Special regulations governing the settlement of bargains on 21st September, foreshadowed in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, have now been approved by the Stock Exchange Committee and are as under:- Settling Room will be open until 3 p.m. on 19th and 20th Septenmber. Tickets must be issued by noon on 19th September. Members should issue tickets before 19th September if possible. Liability times for tickets regularly issued by noon on 19th September: Nob tteorittg teotocks Holder of ticket Holder of ticket at at 21st Septemher ... 3p.m. on 19th Noon on 20th September Soptember Suhw elt t~n .. Notoi 'lo i pre- No tno n day pre vioul to, elliog vtouls to selling On 19th September Scrip Tickets may pass between 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Scrip Tickets may not be issued later than noon on 19th September. Latest time for delivery of all securities is 12.45 p.m. Differences can be collected in the Settling Room on 21st September as usual. The Committee has also issued the following notice concerning buying-in and selling-out in connection with cash bar- gains:- BUYING-IN: If securities deliverable by transfer deed are not delivered within eleven (lays the issuer of the ticket may buy in the same against the seller on the eleventh day after the date of issue of the ticket or on any subsequent day. SELLING-OUT: While the temporary regulations are in force the deliverer of securities deliverable by transfer deed who has not received a ticket by noon on the fifth business day after the date of the bargain should report the matter in writing to the manager of the buying-in and selling-out department. He will in- quire into the reason of the delay and report to the Committee if in his opinion selling-out should take place. In any case where a report as to the failure to issue a ticket is made after noon on the fifth business day after the date of the bargain the manager of the buying-in and selling-out department will claim the official charge from the member against whom the report is made whether the shares or stock are sold out or not. It has been ruled that sellers of securi- ties with alternative forms of holding quoted under the heading of \" British Funds, etc.,\" in the Stock Exchange Daily Official Lists are entitled to make delivery in registered form. A further ruling is that the times for the declaration of options laid down in Rule 110 (1) and (2) shall be 12.45 p.m. instead of 2.45 p.m.",

   "text_content" : "WORK ON PROPERTY PROGRESS ACCORDING TO PLAN .M1I. S. S. TAYLOR'S SPEEClH The second annual ordinary general meeting of the Nehanga Consolidated Copper Mines, Ltd., was held yesterday at Southern House, Cannon-street, E.C. In the absence of the Rt. Hon. Sir Auckland C. Geddes, P.C., G.C.M.G., K.C.B., the deputy-chairman, the chair was taken by Ma. S. S. TAYLOR, C.M.G., D.S.O., the managing director. The Assistant Secretary (Mr. G. E. Sinmmonds) read the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors. Mr. S. S. Taylor said: Ladies and gentlemen,-In the ordinary course our deputy-chairman, Sir Auckland Geddes, would have presided at this meeting. As you doubtless know, his absence is due to his being engaged on work of national importance. The report and accounts have been in your hands for some time. You will note from the balance-sheet that the invest- ment in buildings, plant and machinery which stood at a figure of Â£325,230 on 31st March, 19:8, has been increased to Â£944.047 at the date of the accounts. The balance of cash on hand at the same date was Â£1,732,415. The consulting engineer's report out- lines in detail the operations at the mine up to 31st March. At that date the vertical shaft had reached the final depth under the present programme and since that time concreting of the shaft has proceeded. By 15th August the pump incline shaft had reached an incline depth of 3.108 ft from the surface on the incline and the sub-incline of the service shaft had reached a depth of 1,176 ft on the incline below the 470-ft level. From the service shaft at the 360-ft level and at the 470-ft level development work has been done. Drives have been extended along the contours of the ore- body and crosscuts have opened up the ore-body from footwall to hanging wall. MINING METIODS This work has provided valuable infor- mation as to the structure of the ore-body and with this information in hand it has been possible to plan two experimental mining methods. It is proposed to lay out one panel for ton slicinir and one nanel immediately below on the dip of the ore- body for caving. Development work for this purpose is now in hand. I must point out that we are feeling our way. In the light of the experience we gain we shall be able to determine the mining method or methods most suitable for the deposit. It may be pointed out that the areas selected for the experi- mental mining methods represent the best location to avoid interference with the future large-scale operations, and conse- quently have been selected without refer- ence to the average value of the ore as a whole. However, before mining can be under- taken it will be necessary to drain com- pletely all the water-bearing strata lying above the ore to be mined. Additional diamond drillholes are being put in with this end in view. As will have been gathered from the figures set out in the consulting engineer's report we have ample pumping capacity to deal with any water that can be expected to be encountered. ORE AVAILABLE FOR MINING As a result of the development work already accomplished it has been provi- sionally estimated that the ore available for mining above the 470-ft level amounts to approximately 3,000,000 short tons of ore averaging -6.86 per cent. copper, of which 2.29 per cent. is sulphide and 4.57 per cent. oxide. As one would expect, this ore being com- paratively near the surface contains a igher percentage of oxide than we may anticipate at greater depth. Since the close of the financial year the pilot plant has been completed and was put into operation on the 3rd August. Except for minor mechanical adjustments the trial run of the plant proved satisfac- tory. For the purpose of this preliminary run the major portion of the ore was taken from the reserve dump on the surface and the concentrates obtained have been railed to Nkana, where by arrangement with the Rhokana Corporation, Ltd., they will be treated in the smelter belonging to that Corporation. PILOT PLANT CAPACITY Until the results from the pilot plant permit a decision to be taken as to the metallurgical methods to be adopted in a full scale plant that plant cannot of course be designed or ordered and it is therefore impossible to forecast any date at which production of copper on a large scale will commence. However the pilot plant has a nominal capacity of 500 tons of ore per day and the copper which will be recovered from the operations of that plant should provide a certain amount of revenue to the company. It is possible however that the actual tonnage capacity of the plant may be considerably in excess of the nominal figure mentioned above. Further construction work has of course proceeded since the end of the year on housing. Work on the extension of the power plant is being expedited in anticipa- tion of the arrival of a new n-fl0n kilnr.1t. generator. To sum up I would say that the execu- tion of our plans has proceeded in a normal and satisfactory manner. THE DIRECTORATE During the year we have suffered a great loss by the death of our colleague, Sir Edmund Davis, whose long connection with and intense interest in the Northern Rhodesian copper industry are well known to you. Sir Dougal Malcolm has been appointed to fill the vacancy upon the Board and will come up for re-election at this meeting. Up to 31st December, 1938, the general manager and staff of Rhokana Corpora- tion were responsible for the supervision of the work at this company's mine. This arrangement however was only intended to be temporary and as from 1st January this year our manager, Mr. Pope, with his staff has been responsible for the adminis- tration and operations at the mine. I have to express the satisfaction of the Board with the work which has been carried out by them and also our appre- ciation of the valuable services rendered by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, Ltd. I now have to propose: \"That the directors' report and accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1939, be and they are hereby approved and adopted,\" and I will ask Sir Dougal Malcolm to second the resolution. Sir Dougal O. Malcolm, K.C.M.G., Continued at foot of following column Continued from preceding column seconded the resolution and it was carried unanimously. Sir Dougal O. Malcolm, K.C.M.G., who has been elected a director during the year, was unanimously re-elected, and Sir Ernest Oppenheimer and Sir Auckland Geddes, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., who retired by rotation, were also unanimously re-elected. The auditors, Messrs. Deloitte Plender Griffiths and Co., were reappointed, and the proceedings then terminated.",

   "text_content" : "EFFECT OF LANCEGAYE ACQUISITION BOARD'S DISTRIBUTION POLICY MR. GRAHAM CUNNINGHAM'S REVIEW The eighteenth ordinary general meet- ing of the Triplex Safety Glass Company, Ltd., was held yesterday at the Ilolborn Restaurant, High Holborn, W.C. Mr. Graham Cunningham, LL.B. (chair- man and managing director), presided. The notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors having been read, The Chairman said: Ladies and gentle- men,-In many respects the face of our accounts has changed this year; but a close examination will show the result of the year's developments and that most of the usual features are still there and can be recognised. Our capital is up because of the Lancegaye acquisition, which 1 dealt with at the extra-ordinary general meet- ing held in July That, of course, accounts not only for the increase of issued capital on the left-hand side of the balance-sheet but for the cost of the acquisition of Lancegaye on the assets (or right-hand) side. Our creditors are up a good deal on last year's figure, and there again one generally looks at debtors at the same time as creditors, and you will find that both figures are substantially higher than the corresponding figure for the preceding year. The increase in these figures as well as in the value of our stock is accounted for substantially by the addi- tional business and turnover we are doing for Government Departments. USE OF SUBSIDIARIES' RESERVE The subsidiary compan:es reserve ac- count was increased by a further receipt of Â£2,15. from our associated company in America. Having fought for 11 years on the infringement action, the Triplex Safety Glass Company of North America are now having a fight with the income-tax authorities. Whether that law action will last as long is a matter on which I will not speculate, but. in the circumstances, as this reserve was created purely in order that one subsidiary could pay for another, we have dealt with the reserve by writing down to a nominal figure of Â£1 the amounts owing by subsidiaries and using the balance in writing down the value of our shares in subsidiary com- panies. This seems to be a proper way of handling the matter and, at any rate, keeps our assets down to a desirably low value. On the assets side of the balance-sheet nothing much is changed, except that we have created a new item under the heading of office appliances. We apply a higher rate of wear and tear to the value of office machinery than to that of office furniture, and, as we mechanise our office work as much as possible, we thought it desirable to have all our office machines under a separate heading from furniture, fixtures and fittings. The only other item which calls for comment is the loan to our associated com- pany, \"Triplex\" (Northern), Ltd. This was a temporary loan at interest higher than we receive from our bankers, and, although not paid off by 30th June, it has now been paid in full, so calls for no further remarks. RESERVE AGAINST INVESTMENTS I now direct your attention to the profit and loss account. The interest on invest- ments is reduced by the fact that no divi- dends were received from \"Triplex\" (Northern), Ltd. Furthermore, as the value of our investments, as shown in our balance-sheet, dropped rather more than we thought was a normal depreciation, we appropriated virtually the whole of the income of our investments for the creation of a reserve in respect of the lower selling value of those investments. In the ordinary course, your Board would not consider it prudent to make pro- vision each year for every depreciation of the company's investments, any more than it would be proper to take credit for any increase in their value. Either the profit or the loss should only be brought into account when any of the investments were sold and the loss or profit ascertained. As, however, the investments suffered such a depreciation that it did not seem likely in the opinion of the Board that they would recover during the period of the next 12 months, it was thought proper that some provision should be made, and that has accordingly been done. EXPENDITURE ON A.R.P. Another item which appears in the profit and loss account as a debit is a provision to the extent of Â£5,000 in relation to A.R.P. expenditure. The Government have an- nounced that they will assist companies by making them the allowance of the income- tax on approved expenditure incurred in respect of A.R.P. as though that expendi- ture were a capital expense. In the opinion of your Board, A.R.P. cost is not an invest- ment of capital productive of any income, but is money paid out without any prospect of recovery, because trenches, shelters and the like cannot be sold or put to any pro- ductive purpose, and the money spent on them could never be recovered as far as one can see. In those circumstances, it does not seem proper that the cost should be treated as capital; if the expenditure is rightly charged to revenue the Government are really making no contribution at all by allowing the expense to be freed from income-tax. That is no help when you have to foot the bill. Â£5,000 will not cover the expenditure which your company will have to bear for taking appropriate pre- cautions. Before this week is out. the whole of our A.R.P. scheme at our Kings Norton works should be completed, and much of the work at our Willesden factory is ready for use, and the rest of it is well on the way. Many of our personnel have been trained and more are undergoing training in A.R.P., and everything possible has been done at both our works more than to comolv with the reauirements laid down. EXTENSIVE PRECAUTIONS In addition to providing shelters for our staff and equipment for their use, con- siderable moneys have been spent on the reinforcement of the factory where essen- tial plant is used. Furthermore, one of our works may have to be entirely camouflaged. A scheme has been prepared and everything is ready, and this will be a further burden on the revenue of the company. Additionally, both our works had to take steps for the complete obscuration of light-a difficult problem, because one does not know what part of the factory will be required for production and what will not in these early days of hostilities. Exper-t advice was sought on all these matters, and wherever possible the approval of the authorities obtained before the expense was authorised by your Board. I have dwelt at some length on these matters, because I want to emphasise that all these things have to he paid for, and they are paid for in two ways. First, they tend to increase cost of production and, secondly, they tend to decrease the amount of profit available for distribution by way of dividends. It is a two-edged sword which reduces income anl at the same time puts up the cost of living. I am not sug- gesting it is not a very proper and neces- sary expense. My purpose is merely to point out to you the effect it will have on industry. Our provision for income-tax and N.D.C. is up, partly because income-tax is at a higher rate, and partly also because the provision for N.D.C. last year was only for a portion of the year, and this year is for a full year. DIVIDEND PAYMENT After all these reservations have been made and, I suggest to you, properly made, there is left available profit for the year of just over Â£92,000, and the amount of dividend which I hope to recommend to you shortly will rather more than absorb the amount of that profit. Your directors have made a full distribution, because they consider that the more money which at the present time is put into circulation the better, provided there is adequate liquid cash for all the contemplated needs of the company for the time being. There are one or two things to which I have made reference in dealing with the details of the accounts which need further explanation, and the first of them is the fact that no dividend was received during the year from \" Triplex \" (Northern), Ltd. S )me few years ago I told you that \"Triplex\" (Northern) had purchased a conipany interested in plastics, called \" Ashdowns.\" Now, if any of you have observed the reports of the outstanding public companies whose business is en- tirely or substantially connected with plastics, you will, I think, see that they have all reported thait they have not made money in plastics, but they hope to do so soon, and that the plastic industry has great prospects. It might sound imper- tinent for me to say that I think they are right, but, nevertheless, my opinion is the same as theirs. I believe plastics have great prospects, but only if the larger manufacturers get together instead of entering into an absurd cut-throat compe- tition from which no one will benefit in the long run. CONTROL OF \" ASIIDOWNS \" As you know, we have no controlling interest in \"Triplex\" (Northern), Ltd. That controlling interest belongs to Pilkington Brothers, Ltd., and, in conse- quence, the management and control of Ashdowns was likewise with Pilkington Brothers. I must emphasise, however, that my colleague, Captain Sheperd, and I, who served on the Boards of \"Triplex\" (Northern) and Ashdowns, have always found the friendliest co-operation between Pilkington Brothers and your company. Although we think the plastic industry has great possibilities and although it has potential developments in the motor trade, which induced us originally to take part, through \" Triplex\" (Northern) in the acquisition of Ashdowns, there is not suffi- cient stability in the industry to make it desirable for your company to put up more capital in a company where we have not entire control without the prospect of a reasonable return in a reasonable time. As a result of negotiations with Pilk- ington Brothers, the latter took over from \"Triplex\" (Northern) the whole of the goodwill of Ashdowns on terms which, in the opinion of your Board, were generous and favourable to \" Triplex \" (Northern). This transaction took place on the 30th June last, and as from that date \" Trip- lex \" (Northern) would, but for hostilities having commenced, have again been solely interested in the production of safety glass for the motor trade and, in our opinion, should have been on a profit-earn- ing basis as from the commencement of our financial year. TRADING OF SUBSIDIARIES Our subsidiaries, Quickfit and Quartz, Ltd., and the Thermolux Glass Company, Ltd., have really been unlucky. Thermolux was doing well and, in our opinion, should have been making profits by now, had it not been for A.R.P. As you know, \"Thermolux\" affords one of the finest types of factory glazing in existence, but it is natural that, when, owing to the national emergency which arose, every roof lighting and, in fact, every window of any sort had to be obscured and steps taken to prevent broken glass falling on to employees, the tendency in new build- ings was to restrict the amount of roof lighting and not increase it. I regret to think of the result which this policy is bound to have in relation to the efficiency of industrial production and the health of the workpeople of this country in the course of years. Owing to the state of emergency which has pre- vailed, such is, however, the tendency and we must face up to it. Nevertheless, it is great credit due to the qualities of \" Thermolux \" and to those responsible for its production and sale that we have main- tained our position as well as we have. Whether the setback is only temporary, time alone will show. As to Quickfit and Quartz, we were in the position earlier in the year that we had many more orders than we could execute, but try as we might we could not get skilled labour, and meantime our sales organisation was building 'up a good export business to foreign countries and to our dominions and colonies. Last week I- I .,.1. - -- - I- ! - .. 1 tne noaro ui 1 rauc i.oucu a v-u--u-. -> the export to any destination outside the United Kingdom of the whole of this com- pany's products. We are applying for licenses to permit us to export, but whether we shall be successful I do not know. In these circumstances I cannot even guess at what the future holds for these two subsidiary companies. WILLESDEN FACTORY REBUILDING In the early part of this year it was decided to rebuild a substantial part of our Willesden factory. Work was com- menced, and it is anticipated that it will be finished early in the New Year. When the contract was originally placed it was contemplated that the work would be finished during the current month, but, owing to the requirements of A.R.P. and light obscuration, modifications to the plans had to be made which have set back the progress of the work by fully three months, but during the whole of this time output has been increased, and when the job is finished there will be a very fine shop at Willesden capable of considerably greater output than was formerly the case. As a result of our acquisition of the Continued in following column Continued from preceding column majority of the shares of Lancegaye Safety Glass (1934), Ltd., which includes the whole share capital of Gilt Edge Safety Glass, Ltd., it was anticipated that in the course of time output would be increased in the \"Triplex\" factories, which should have reduced cost of produc- tion. but now all our calculations must be revised. As you can well imagine, it will be necessary for us, in collaboration with our subsidiary and associated companies, to rearrange our factories in the best possible manner to deal with the requirements of the market, and that will be done with due consideration to the various localities. Although the production of safety glass for the private car trade has been cut down to a trifle of our output capacity, it must not be thought that our works are idle. I am not going to tell you what we are doing or expected to do. In our private lives owing to the war our habits must be changed, difficulties are of daily occur- rence and decisions hard to make; how much more so, therefore, when a company's policy is involved, affecting the employ- ment of hundreds of persons and the care of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Of one thing we all feel certain-that when we have won this war-as win it we shall-\" Triplex \" glass will still be a household name and \" Triplex \" will again be fitted to the cars you will be buying Swhen the fighting is done, so remember- Swhen peace returns-fit \"Triplex \" and be safe once again. I now move the adoption of the report and the passing of the accounts for the year ended 30th June, 1939, and I will ask my colleague, Lord Stanmore, to second that resolution, after which I shall be pleased to answer any questions. The Rt. Hon. Lord Stanmore, P.C., K.C.V.O. (deputy chairman), seconded the resolution, and, the Chairman having replied to questions, it was carried unani- mously. A dividend of 2s per stock unit, less tax, was declared; the retiring director, Mr. W. R. Lyttleton, was re-elected, and the auditors, Messrs. Tansley Witt and Co., were reappointed. The meeting ended with a hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman."
