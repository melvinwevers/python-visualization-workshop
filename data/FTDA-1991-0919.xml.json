   "text_content" : "By Laura Sliber In Belgrade and David Bu*han In The Hague THE PROSPECTS for a European-sponsored peace in Yugoslavia appeared to recede last night after the fragile ceasefire engineered by Lord Carrington was shattered by fierce fighting around besieged army baaein Croatia. But, as battles continued between Croat forces and fed- eral army units, Lord Carring- ton, the former British foreign secretary, who brokered the ceasefire on the European Community's behalf, said it was too early to write off the truce. Speaking on Radio France International, he said: \"We have to leave it for 24 hours and see how the cease- fire goes.\" The fighting was concen- trated in eastern and southern Croatia and on the Adriatic coast, with Yugoslav warships bombarding Split, the second biggest Croatian port. The conflict was being closely watched by leaders of the EC and the West European Unio4 (WEU), the nine-nation European defence body which meets in The Hague tonight to consider a Dutch proposal to send an intervention force to separate the warring parties. Last night it emerged that, if the ministers do not back the plan, France's foreign minister, Mr Roland Dumas, may pro- pose at the UN General Assem- bly next week that a UN peace- keeping force be sent to Yugoslavia. In The Hague, Mr John Major, the British prime minis- ter, said he did not \"see any immediate likelihood of [the Europeans] sending in a force\" to Yugoslavia. Speaking after talks with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, Mr Major said the Yugoslav civil war was a \"difficult and dangerous situa- tion\". He said the presence of European peace-keeping troops on Yugoslav soil would depend on agreement by all sides in the conflict, and on the estab- lishment of a lasting ceasefire. Mr Lubbers said he did not want to pre-judge tonight's meetings of foreign ministers of the EC Twelve and of the member states of the WEU. End of Me inhe for evllelP In one of Europe' copital . ciles ...........................Page Book review: A orisis put in perspeoIl.ve............Page 18 But earlier, Mr Hans van d- Brook, Dutch foreign minister aid there was a better chanc- of maintaining a ceasefire with an armed European force than with the present EC monitors \"who have to leave when the shnoting starts\". In the warring republic, as :both sides blamed each other fo:.r taking the aoffensive, it ws reported that Mr Luka Bebic, he Croatian minister of defence, had resigned. Mr Bebic, who apparently acted too soon on Tuesday by ordering the Croatian forces to unblock federal barracks, is generally considered to have exerted a moderate influence. I ft was the Croatian attack on military bases which provoked the recent surge in fighting, according to the federal army. On the military front, Cro- atian radio said Sibenik, a port south of Split, was \"under the complete control\" of Croat forces and that federal army units were withdrawing from the strategic Maslinicabridge, linking inland Croatia to its southern Adriatic coastline. However, the mayor of Zadar, one of seven Adriatic ports under naval blockade, e id to Italy for help as f forces advanced on the city. Italy and Hungary - Yugoslavia's neighbours - were watching the fighting ith intense nervousness. In Zagreb, the Croatian capt ts; snipers fired from blocks of rmy flats on to the streets. Pedestrians scrambled for cover and traffic sped from the city centre area. Sirens wailed again in the capital, driving the inhabitants to air raid she- ters for a fourth day as air force jets flew over the city. Telephone communications between Zagreb and Belgrade, the Federal and Serbian capi- tal, were cut Belgrade radio clanimed this resulted from \"an act of sabotage by Croatia\".",

The aim is to provide protec- tive cover for UN helicopters searching for the sites of Presi- dent Saddam Hussein's weap- ons of mass destruction, according to US and western officials, who said it did not signal the start of an offensive operation. President George Bush, speaking in Grand Canyon, Arizona, said the US was deter mined that Mr Saddam comply with the UN mandate to inspect Iraq's nuclear facilities but damped speculation that military action was near. \"There are no threats, that's not what this is about,\" he aid. \"There's no dead- line ... I'm confident he doesn't want a fight. I don't think it will come to that.\" General Brent Scowcroft, Mr Bush's national security adviser, said the fighters would escort the UN helicopters should Mr Saddam continue to restrict their movements. \"It's an escort mission. If he will comply with the UN reso- lutions, there won't need to be an execute order,\" he said. The dispatch of US fighters would escalate the long- running dispute between Iraq nd the UN Security Council which has sought unsuccess- fully to persuade Iraq to grant unconditional access to more Rock steady: President Bush, in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, says Iraq must permit inspection of its nuclear facilities than 40 sites suspected of har- bouring chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. However, a senior Pentagon official stressed that \"there are no US military units on the way to the Gulf at this time\", and the hope in Washington yesterday was that unanimous pressure from the UN would avert a confrontation. UN diplomats became more optimistic yesterday that Bagh- dad would reach agreement on the operation of the helicopter units. Mr Abdul Amir al Anbari, Iraq's UN envoy, described the inspection dis- pute as \"a tempest in an empty Cup of tea\". Iraq had said this week it would perrit UN he'icopter flights but imposed conditions which were unacceptable to the US, Britain and France, all permanent members of the Security Council. The US has taken the lead on enforcing compliance, and has won support for its plan to send armed escorts to accom- pany the UN inspection teams from France ard Britain.

   "text_content" : "By Paul ChIeserIght and Michael Cassell THE ECONOMY is ingutj out of recession, Mr Robin Leigh- Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, said yester- day, but he warned that there would be no sustainable growth without price stability His optimistic tone was ecn- oed by Mr John Banham, direc- tor-general of the Confedera- tion of British Industry, who said there were encouraging signs that the recession would be followed next year by the start of a period of sustained economic growth. He suggested that the reces- sion had now bottomed out in most sectors of the economy and that a modest recovery late this year should give way to economic buoyancy. In a speech to the Birming ham Chamber of Industry and commerce and the West MMi lands branch of the CL, Mr Leigh-Pemberton was enmpwih that -only the steady U tion of an ppr e mdi term poicy can lay the fund- tons for stable nonnfladto ary growth\".

Mr Leigh-Pemberton dis.- agreed with the Labour party and many in West Midlands business who want the econ- omy to be given a kick-start because they believe recovery will take longer than the gov- ernment expects. He saic: '\"here is no short cut to higher investment and growta through artificial stimuli to investment and consumption.\" Mr Leigh-Pemberton was now more optimistic about the -media eom pets than the Bank had been in ugust, wIhen the qu arterly economic bulletin talked or Dumping along the bottom\". Mentioning the rise in total manufacturing output, lower wholesale prices and a fall in -the retail price index, he said \"the picture is undeniably 'mproving\". Above all, \"growth in wages and prices is still emining\". Mr Leigh-Pemberton said his future concern was to ensure that inflation was always nipped in the bud before it became serious. \"If we can only think in terms of price stability, then we will see the n-eed to respond when price stability is threatened rather than simply when, at a later tage of the process, inflation looks like getting out of hend. \"Price stability is an abc lute precondition fr sustain able growth in output and job for maintaining competitive- -â¢ and for stablity In U -mlarc of paymen.

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hargreaves BRITISH GAS faces another row and possible legal action from its power station custom- ers with the disclosure yester- day that almost all of the gas it made available for power gen- eration on Monday has already been sold. It cut its prices on Monday for a limited supply of gas almost all of which - close to Ibn therms a year - has been contracted to two ventures that were planning to sue the company over a previous price increase in March. British Gas said on Monday that it was talking to 12 con- sortia planning power projects, but it will only be able to sup- ply three or four of them. The movb has enraged'dany of the companies planning independent power projects in the UK. They assert that the two ventures - Thames Power and Mobil-Eastern Electricity - have effectively been awarded compensation by Brit- ish Gas without which they would have been unable to afford the new price. \"This not a good day for independent power genera- tion,\" said Mr Phil Champ, director of corporate develop- ment at East Midlands Elec- tricity, who was hoping to buy Continued on Page 20 Reaction, Page 9 Lax, Page 20 GaS contracts Continue f..m aw gus to suW a wanDed project In Rugby. \"wil now have to oideroaur legal poition.\" T1 independent companies say they have received unfair tPtment at the hands of Brit- sh Gas, which they claim favoured Thames Power and Mobil-Eastern Electricity in -der to dclear the writs that The new dispute could threaten the government's Itention of njecting more .-p-atain tina the electrlict- ft U ftHlnt pnr r\" mon - overaolt to auctio gs i mports in an attempt to make more supplies available. ritish Gas has contracted to supply Thames Power and a MoUbl-astern Eerictty isont venture with more then the- quarters of the bn therms of gas it allotted to the power market from IsLs.

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd In Moscow MR Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister and head of the acting Soviet government, yes- terday reversed his decision to quit his Soviet post but said he was resigning as Russian pre- mier. He said yesterday he had been prevailed upon to stay as chairman of the Committee for Management of the National Economy, which acts as the Soviet government, and to take on the additional post of chair- man of the Inter-Republican Economic Committee, the body which will guide the Joint eco- nomic affairs of those republics which sign an economic treaty. He is charged with working out a plan for the structure and functions of the Inter-Re- publican Committee within a month. The new committee is expected to substitute for the more than 60 Soviet ministries now living on borrowed time under their deputy ministers, following the resignation of the pre-coup cabinet. Following a meeting with Mr Nicholas Brady, the US trea- sury secretary, and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, Mr Silayev announced that the US would speed up the provision of $375m (Â£221.8m) in grain credits. The Russian prime minister had earlier said that he would press strongly for up to $7bn of aid from the west. The confused moves at the top appear to reflect a series of intensifying power struggles within the ruling Soviet and Russian groups. Aides to Mr Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, was taken ill yesterday, but there were differing versions as to the seriousness of his condi- tion. A report from the news agency Interfax said he was taken to hospital with a \"coronary deficiency\". Mr Yeltsin, 60, has a history of heart complaints. However, lter reports quoted aides as saying he was resting at nome and would make a sheduled speech today. Boris Yeltsin had let it be known in recent weeks that Mr Silayev was not highly earded by the Russian presi- dent, while his threat to resign as head of the acting Soviet government came after an attack upon him by Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow chief executive and a fellow member of the acting government. Mr Silayev said yesterday that all members of the State Council, which unites the republic and Soviet presidents, had asked him to stay in his union post at its meeting on Monday - including, he said pointedly, Mr Yeltsin. It had been earlier thought hat Mr Silayev would relin- quish the post of chairman in avour of Mr Arkady Volsky, deputy chairman and president f the Scientific-Industrial League, the employers' organi- sation. His confirmation in the post, and the decision to apoint bhim as chairman of the Inter-Republican Comnmittee, shows that those favouring a cautious approach to reform are winning the day. However, the future of the inter-republican agreement, and thus of the Inter-Republi- can Economic Committee, is itself uncertain. The draft agreement, drawn up by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a member of the committee and a radical economist, was accepted by the republics only \"in general\" - a formula, as the daily Izvestia noted on Tuesday, which has in the past meant that nothing will come of it. Mr Yavlinsky said after the decision: \"I'm sick and tired cf waiting, and I hate the idea of fooling the people once more. I'm afraid they (the State Council) will adopt my pro- posal, have something else in mind and then get down to implementing something quite different. They must adopt the entire package, so that it can work as a single system - oth- erwise it will all go down the drain.\" 0The International Monetary Fund has chosen a French banker, Mr Jean Foglizzo, to head the office it plans to open in Moscow when arrangement- for Soviet associate member ship of the Fund are com- pleted, writes Leyla Boulton In Moscow Mr Foglizzo, who has worked \"or the Fund in the past, was employed by Banque Paribas in New York in the late 1980s.

   "text_content" : "fBy umniln P.n In Bonn and P*etr Bruc. in Madrid FRANCE and Germany agreed yesterday on the need for emergency humanitarlan assis- tance for the Soviet Union this winter, and will jointly press for immediate action from the European Community and the Group of Seven industrialised nations. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said after talks with French President Frangols Mit- terrand that they had agreed on the need for aid this winter, \"what we must do, and how we will coordinate help\". Mr Mitterrand said there was \"no difficulty any more\" on aid for the \"sovereign republics which compose today the for- mer USSR\". His stress on the disintegrated nature of the Soviet state may not, however, have been to Mr Kohl's liking as the German leader has argued strongly for mainte- nance of a significant central- ised structure. On European Community co-operation, Mr Mitterrand said it was necessary to work swiftly for agreement on Euro- pean monetary and political union before the EC summit in Maastricht at the end of the year. Mr Kohl also stressed the urgency of negotiations, but neither leader gave details of agreements or disagreements. They will have further talks in mid-November in an attempt to co-ordinated a common Franco- German position in advance of the summit. Mr Felipe Gonzilez, the. Spanish premier, travels to Bonn today for a hastily arranged meeting with Mr Kohl. Madrid is alarmed by dif- ferences between Germany and France, notably over Yugo- slavia, and fears these may weaken Bonn's commitment to quick political union in the EC. The recent French decision to block agricultural imports into the EC from some east European countries is regarded as a serious political mistake in Madrid as it annoyed Ger- many. France's decision to deploy short-range Hades mis- siles next year has also wcrried the Spaniards, who feel they will inevitably bel pointed' bast.",

   "text_content" : "8rrblsn i~ghters tele a hreeh in the cuSan Crdetian tonm olllorovo 8elo yerterday By Judy Dempsey in Zagret THE inspector's voice was calm and clear. \"Please switch off all lights in all the car- riages. We will be arriving in Zagreb in a few minutes.\" The unlit train snaked along the western suburbs of the Croatian capital. The late sum- mer's night was pitch dark. The train, painted in Croatia's national colours of blue and white, pulled into Zagreb West station. There were none of the usual railway announcements or hustle. The local restaurant was closed. Those few commuters waiting for another train stood silent, protected by a handful of Croatian soldiers. The train then pulled out and edged towards Zagreb. One of central Europe's capi- tal cities was paralysed. At this time of year, young and old are usually returning from holidays or enjoying the end of the long summer. But at 9pm last night I was suddenly jolted into a different world. At first the image of Buchar- est, the Romanian capital, sprang to mind. The scene was reminiscent of the unlit streets and hotel rooms during the height of President Ceausescu's energy shortages. One recalled the last throes of the Ceaugescu regime in December 1989, when snipers controlled the streets. Last night the Croatian gov- ernment said snipers were now in the capital. Outside the city - and in the heart of Europe - a civil war is being waged. While propaganda and truth feed off each other, it is still very difficult to believe that the federal army would bomb the heart out of this lovely city. Alighting from the train, people spoke in muffled voicas. There were no porters. No lights. No trolleys. No taxis. There was no sign of the man who blows the whistle. \"Is this the train from Vienna?\" one elderly man inquired. Since the beginning of the week no Croatian train goes that far north. Coming south, passengers must change on the Austrian-Slovenian border at Spielfeld and then a small Cro- atian train winds its way through the Alpine republic to Croatia. Timetables are now unrelia- ble, because for the first time since Croatia declared its inde- pendence on June 25 the war is affecting the capital. For the first time in many years, peo- ple feel afraid. Andrej was no exception. He had spent the best part of the summer in Greece and was now travelling home. His girlfriend mocked him for not joining Croatia's National Guard. His mother, who lives in Zagreb, begged him to stay abroad. Andrej, a 24-year-old medical student, had to choose. \"I will have to do what I can to defend my city. This war is crazy. There are no winners in this wretched situation,\" he said. \"The Croats have their own goals, as much as Serbia. Pres- ident Tudjman, whose nation- alist rhetoric and programme I cannot support, wants interna- tional recognition of Croatia. President Milosevic [of Serbia] wants, by whatever means, to create a Greater Serbia. \"The will to negotiate a political solution does not exist. In the villages in Croa- tia, Serbs and Croats will never be able to live side by side again. Whoever speaks out publicly against either leader is a traitor. I will proba- bly be called up. I think my papers are waiting for me at home...\" We shook hands. He walked into the night.",

   "text_content" : "By lan Davildson in Paris THE French government yesterday adopted a draft bud- get for 1992 which promises a sharp slowdown in government spending in real terms and a reduction in the deficit from 1991's level The government said the French economy was poised to emerge from recession in the latter months of this year, and gave notice of its intention to tighten its anti-inflation policy. Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, described it as a \"healthy\" budget which would help consolidate \"com- petitive disinflation\". But she insisted she would continue to strengthen the government's industrial policy and its efforts to create new employment. Mr Jack Lang, a government spokesman, claimed the gov- ernment could be proud of hav- ing \"won the battle of money and prices\", and predicted a \"moderate\" economic recovery would take hold in the second half of this year. This should take the economic growth rate to 2.2 per cent next year, against this year's expected 1.4 per cent. Total government expendi- ture is scheduled to rise next year to FFrl,330bn (Â£133.13bn), a nominal increase of 3.1 per cent on this year's spending. This is slightly more than the predicted rate of inflation, which the government expects to remain steady at the current rate of 2.8 per cent. The deficit of FFr89bn allowed for in the 1992 draft budget breaks the steady downward trend which the government has pursued over the past three years, largely because its calculations for 1991 were thrown by the unex- pected steepness of the down- turn, which started late last year. The 1991 budget deficit was to have been reduced from FFr90bn to FFr80Obn; in the event a shortfall in tax reve- nues will swell this year's expected deficit 'to about FFr1OObn. Nevertheless, the govern- ment stresses the French bud- get deficit scheduleI for next year, at only 1.26 per cent of gross domestic product, is sig- nificantly less than the fore- cast German budget deficit of 3.1 per cent of GDP. It also boasts that the French inflation rate is signifi- cantly below that of most of France's main economic part- ners, apart from Japan and Denmark, and that the econ- omy is now well placed to take advantage of the expected recovery. The government's budget statement identifies high levels of unemployment as one of the black spots in the economy, and a priority for remedial action. It focuses particularly on the high cost of employ- ment - through minimum sal- ary and social security costs - as an important factor behind the particularly high rate of unemployment among, the young, twice the national aver- age. Explicitly the government suggests it would be desirable to reduce these social security charges on young employees; implicitly, it seems to be critic- ising the existing SMIC (mini- mum wage) rates. The principal victim of the budget squeeze is the Defence Ministry, whose expenditure is being held steady in nominal terms at FFrl95.5bn. But the Education Ministry does well with a 5.7 per cent increase to FFr262bn, while the research budget rises 5.9 per cent. The budget for help to indus- try climbs from FFrl7.8bn to FFr18.7bn, while the provision for new capital for state-owned companies is being increased from FFr4.4bn to FFr5.6bn.",

The Commission decide- that the law needed to be revamped before the Commu- nity completes its single mar- ket after 1992. Restructuring involving labour cuts where decision affecting employees in one country were made in another were becoming increasingly common, it said. EC ministers still have to approve the plan.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Katharine Campbell in Frankfurt FRESH urgency has been injected into talks on creating a centralised stock market supervisory authority in Ger- many following the damage to Frankfurt's international standing caused by this sum- mer's security scandal, accord- ing to Mr Riidiger von Rosen, a board member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Mr von Rosen forecast in an interview yesterday that gov- ernment proposals would emerge in the next few weeks. \"There is a growing readi- ness on the part of the trading community to move towards acceptance of international standards,\" he said. A stock exchange commis- sion on insider trading ended last week its inquiry into Deut- sche Bank, without uncovering any irregularities. But mal- practices in various depart- ments of banks' securities operations are coming to light. Five staff at Dresdner Bank have resigned after allegations of improprieties in new-issues procedures, while Frankfurt city prosecutors are examining cases of alleged fraud in the options warrants market. Economics ministers of the LAnder (states) are due to meet on October 7 to discuss new forms of stock market regula- tion. Ministries have until now retained broad jurisdiction over their local bourses and are expected to fight their cor- ners fiercely, even though the current system of self-regula- tion by banks and brokers has been shown to be inadequate. They are unwilling to cede power to Hesse, where the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Germany's leading exchange, is located and they may thus be forced to accept a neutral body set up in the city with broad oversight over the whole market place. Mr von Rosen said: \"Ger- many needs a single entity that can police the forthomuing nsider trading law as wel as complying with the contents of the investors services and take- over directives currentl under discussoln.\" The deadline for German de to replace the current vour code aon der deal- tisp and implinuent C guide lines is la In a -IU.

   "text_content" : "BIy Olth mili 'ee i in Bonn M Hans Tietmeyer, deputy pidenft of the QermanBund- ves.yterdqa elt ot lthe es\"tibynisimnt of Eurmpean eOc onic and: monetary uniwon (Im), In a clear bid to idiffe te resistance -of his govern nt to any compromise *ithl He called for much greater progress towards economic .convergence of the member tates, specific regulations, backed by sanctions, to control deict spending by EC govern- -ents, andrepeatedly insisted on ithe absolute politicande- pendence of the future Euro- pean central bank from even \"guidelines\" issued by govern- ment ministers. Mr Tletmeyer's statement, in formal evidence submitted to the finance committee of the German Bundestag, amounts to a hardening of the Bundes- bank' attitude towprds any watering down of the pre-con- itions for Em, currently ata critical stage of negotiations in advance o' the December EC summit in Maastricht. He expressed serious reser- vations about proposals for the second phase of Emu, in which final preparations are supposed to be made for full economic audmonetary union - though he broadly backed the plans put forward by the Dutch pres- idAncy of the BEC Both Mr Tietmeyer and Mr Jacques de Larosibre, president of the Banque de France, who also gave evidence yesterday, Agreed that phase two must be kept as short as possible, and be seen as no more than a tran sitional phase. Mr Tietmeyer argued force fully against the establishment of any substantial institution during that period, saying it would simply create a \"grey area\" restricting national com- petence in currency policy, while failing to create a fully- fledged supra-national alterna- tive. The latter must wait for a fully independent European central bank in phase three. He also rejected proposals to strengthen the Ecu, the Euro- pean currency unit, in the intervening period, saying that any such basket-based cur- rency would inevitably, be weaker than the strongest Community currency, and an unacceptable replacement. He rejected arguments by other EC member states for alignment on the economic performance of the average Community country, rather than its best performer, saying that any target other than the lowest inflation rate was unac- ceptable to the Bundesbank. His strongest words were reserved for any hint of serious deficit financing by future member states of Emu, insist- ing that rigorous budgetary discipline should be a precondi tion of membership, main- tained by rules and sanctions. He proposed writing into the treaty the \"golden rule\" of bud- get finance, that no deficit should exceed investment spending, and in addition, to lay down quantified ceilings for state debt, and annual bud- get deficit restrictions in rela- tion to each country's GNP. All those pre-conditions are likely to hit hard at the southern member states of the Community, including Italy, where deficit spending has been the rule. Mr Tietmeyer also called for the completion of the internal market, including progress in harmonising indirect taxation, before economic union could be contemplated - a demand likely to alienate the UK.

According to the latest Amex Bank Review the Dutch Emu draft requires countries to have a recent record of inflation under 5 per cent, a budget deficit under 4 per cent of gross domestic product and a debt to GDP ratio of less than 60 per cent. Two non-EC nations - Norway and Austria - would qualify. But Germany, the \"anchor\" of the exchange ;rate mecha- nisi, as wel as the Nether- ands, Belgium and Ireland, would not qualify despite hav- ing moved closer to fixing their exchange rates. The Amex review says Ger- many, the Netherlands, Bel- gium, and Italy have too high abudget deficits. Belgium an. taly also have high debt 1ev els, as does Ireland. In Britain, Spain and Portugal inflation is oo high for Emu entry. Among EC members, Greece would face the greatest diff. culty joining Emu as it is lkely to see inflation of .8 per cent and a budget defl- cit of 16 per cent of GDP this year.",

   "text_content" : "By Bemard Simon in Toronto CANADA'S economic prospects depend heavily on further progress in bringing down inflation and containing budget deficits, the Organisa- tion of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says in its annual review of the Canadian economy, published today. While applauding Ottawa's recent moves to lower infla- tionary expectations, tighten fiscal discipline and remove some of the structural barriers to long-term growth, the OECD says more needs to be done if Canada is to regain its position as one of the fastest-growing industrial economies. In a special section, the report also singles out aspects of labour policy which have contributed to unusually high unemployment and low rate of productivity growth. It points to relatively high minimunm wages, an unemploy- ment nsurance scheme so gen- erous that it often discourages the jobless from seeking work, and \"significant problems\" in the general education system. Close to one in three students drops out before completing high school. The OECD forecasts that the rCanadian economy will return to positive growth in the sec- ond half of this year after an unexpectedly deep recession. Real gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3.1 per cent in 1992, after a 1 per cent decline this year. The recovery will initially be led by exports, which are expected to jump by 5.6 per cent next year, after stagnating in 1991. Improved consumer demand and business invest- ment should follow in 1992. In the longer term, growth will be given considerable impetus by the US-Canada free trade agreement and by recent sales-tax reforms. These two factors should boost output by 3.5 per t. and 1.5 per cent espeivy. the OECD esti- *m*ates.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels THE European Commission is considering whether to propose a change in the EC's offer to reduce farm subsidies within the Uruguay Round trade nego- tiations, in the light of Brus sels' plans to reform the Com- mon Agricultural Policy (CAP) The debate, being conducted in secret among senior Brus sels agriculture officials, is based on calculations which suggest two different but equally sensitive possible con clusions. These are that: als the EC adopts the radical CAP reform plan the Commis: sion approved in July, it will still not be able to meet the subsidy reductions it has- offered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) within the Uruguay Round. This assumes that direct payments to farmers for swingeing price cuts will stiL be considered subsidies and therefore trade distorting, eve though they are largely decoupled from production; Alternatively, if the direct income payments are consid- ered \"production-neu- tral\" - and put in the Gatt's socalled \"green box\" for subsi- dies which have no impact on trade - then the cuts the EC plans for its internal farm regime are r In eIness of its unew Round offer.

But negotiation on CAP reform is certain to take until at least next spring to com- plete. Brussels thinks that unless the Gatt round is completed earlier, it could get pushed aside by next year's US presi- dential election campaign. It was the US and the Cairns Group of agri-exporters led by Australia which turned down the EC offer last December. Although, politically, the Commission refuses to acknowledge the relationship between the Gatt and CAP The council of agriculture ministers remains deeply hostile to the Brussels blueprint for reform reform, it is anxious to formu- late a coherent position. The available details of Brussels' still preliminary thinking on a new Gatt offer are contained in a confidential Commission memo. This says that the EC's cur- rent ofer within Gatt requires it to reduce total subsidies (aggregate measurement of support) by 2S per cent by betwee now sand IM.

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington US PRESSURE on Japan has derailed a plan by the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecom- munications to create a joint venture between the govern- ment and Japanese companies to develop satellites, according to a senior US trade official. The plan, described in the Japanese press within the last 10 days, produced \"dismay\" within the ranks of the Bush administration and \"a very rapid direct communication with the Japanese government. The US and Japan last year nad negotiated the elimination of restrictions on government procurement of foreign satel- lites and Japan had promised not to subsidise research and development. \"The plan has been with- drawn,\" the US official said. \"There will be no budget request made or honoured to create a subsidy fund for the development of satellites. Despite the alarm produced by the incident, US-Japanese relations are \"proceeding on a standard course\", he said. Aside from US complaints about market access for its paper, car parts and services exports, negotiations over for- mal trade barriers are dimin- ishing. The focus of future trade negotiations in the bilat- eral relationship is on struc- tural trade barriers, which the official said \"gets more compli- cated, more difficult and more interesting\". US manufactured exports to Japan have been steadily ris- ing, but there remains concern that the relationship between Japanese GNP and US manu- factured goods remains nearly steady. It was 4 per cent in 1980 and 7 per cent in 1990. There will be a new empha- sis on pushing Japan to liberal- ise its legal system. The admin- istration wants an end to restrictions on foreigners prac- ticing in Japan and more opportunities for foreign part- ners in Japanese companies.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE US Federal Reserve yesterday shed doubt on the strength of the country's eco- nomic rebound and warned that many regions were still not sharing in the recovery. The survey of economic con- ditions drawn from the 12 Fed- eral Reserve banks around the US said there was \"little sign of a sizeable rebound in con- sumer spending that will con- tribute to a strengthening in business activity\". The survey backs up the Fed's decision last week to cut interest rates, and undermines the Bush administration's con- tention that the economy is on the way to a sustainable recov- ery after a recession this win- ter. Manufacturing showed the most strength, the Fed noted, with the Cleveland and Chi- cago areas showing the great- est rebound from the recession. The Boston and San Francisco regions, however, were still not showing an upturn in indus- trial activity. Agriculture has been hit by the hot, dry summer, with maize harvests particularly affected, although rice and cot- ton crops are expected to be strong. The survey said there was \"little sign of a sizable rebound in consumer spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery\". Retail sales in recent months showed only scattered improvement, and most retail- ers were cautious about sales prospects. Residential investment, meanwhile, \"seems to have lost some upward momentum in recent months\". Fewer than half of the districts reported increases in housing sales and housing starts. Reports from most districts suggested that the recovery in sales and starts has slowed recently, although a few districts said sales or starts were still rising in July and August. Most districts reported either little demand for new mortgage loans or slight declines from previous months.",

Senator Howard Metzen- baum, the Ohio Democrat who ranks as Mr Gates' flercest opponent on the Senate inteli- gence committee which is con- sidering the nomination, has predicted that he will be con- firmed.

Yet, asked about a contro- versial 1984 national intelli- gence estimate predicting political unrest in Mexico, Mr Gates recounted the episode in detail. Senators Alan Cranston, John Glenn and Dennis DeConcini, all Democrats Who might have led the charge against Mr Gates' nomination, have been weakened by their own ethical problems relating to the Keating Five savings and loan scandal. \"We've all made mistakes,\" said one sen- ator, summing up the commit- tee's inclination to forgive and forget. The most serious obstacle to the nomination of Mr Gates, who was deputy director of the CIA between 1986 and 1989 under Mr William Casey, remains the Iran-Contra affair, however.

   "text_content" : ".overpeaceIk By Our MWdl East Sta P1 IU la EMw UEtor, In Whflnqtn MR- .Jla s Baker, the US secretaryo stae, yesterday provldedAyrlaxwlih the writ ten assances that President afezalAssd has been seek- ian in return or his agreement to attend a Middle East peace conference. During talks in Damascus with Mr Assad, Mr Baker ie understood to have provided written confirmation that the basis of peace negotiations will be UN resolutions 242 and 338 and that the future status of east Jerusalem will be a topic for discussion. Syria and other Arab coun- tries had sought US reassur- ance that the principle of exchanging land for peace, ase set out in the two UN resolu- tions, would be kept to, despite statements from senior Israelis that not an inch of occupied Arab land would be ceded. A US official said Mr Baker wanted to hear Mr Assad's comments, but he added: \"We are not engaging in negotia- tions on every single line in every one of these assurance documents.\" Reports from Ca'ro yester- Mr MrMoshe onms, tUe Iraeli defence minister, j~t night saidhewoul TTS demand tha Jewish settlements in th occupied territories as a co4.- dition for receiving loanI guarantees to fund Soviet Jewish immigration, write Hugh Carnegy. day suggested that Mr Baker had narrowed the differences over who should represent the Palestinians at a peace confer- ence. Israel has Insisted that no one linked to the Palestine Liberation Organisation or from east Jerusalem would be acceptable. However, Cairo-based diplo- mats said Israel had agreed in principle to having Palestinian delegates from the two villages of Aizariya and Abu Dis, con- sidered by Arabs to lie within Jerusalem, in a joint Jordani- an-Palestinian delegation at the proposed talks. The two vil- lages are outside the adminis- trative boundaries Israel set for a united Jerusalem after the 1967 war. o t s p tE ames e fhapdoth a se off has becomea 'oodeal mtoreM 'rflft-lreiref' C aCeS Hvei-US ofteicil wr to raq'ins iipyesterday to uplar, down the possibility of a renewed shootis g h irar with succsBaghdad. though co that IhJS air S exforcew i se oved to Saudive nucleai sitdes-throug a kq raids, the clear hope) inWah Arabia meanss that the stand-ent Saddamoff has become a good dealced witHoweverwhelming US olals were wat pave in yesterday to playnds. down The prospective dbiitych of a warplanes, complementing anr with Baghdlready substantial US naval presence in thdestroy suspected nuclea sites through bombing raids, the lear hop fore Irn Wash-q to ington is that that President Saddam Hussein, when faced withcomply with existlming fU respower, wlltons cave ing for full disclo- suThe prospective dispatch of mass warplanes, complementing ann. already substantial US naval presence in the Gulf and east- Thern Mediterranean, has dispute cone ceprincipal aim: s UN inspetors who haveq to comply with existing UN reso- lutions calling for full disclo- sure of its weapons of mass destruction.

This is why US tactics will likely be to use incremen- tal pressure on Iraq over the next few weeks. Even if the deployment of military forces can often take on a momentum of its own, the US aim this week is to enforce compliance - not exact punishment - from a wily adversary.",

   "text_content" : "PHILIPPINE President Corazon Aquino faced the threat of impeachment yesterday and a revolt within her cabinet over her battle to keep US forces in the country in defiance of a Senate decision to evict them, Reuter reports from Manila. Senator Juan Ponce Earle, the opposition leader, called for the president's impeachment, saying she had violated the constitution by allowing US forces to stay without a new treaty. \"There's no question about it, she is liable to impeachment. There is clear ground for impeachment,\" Senator Enrile said. Mrs Aquino faced a possible revolt by up to four ministers within her 22-member cabinet over her decision to hold a national referendum in an effort to overturn Monday's Senate vote rejecting a new military base pact with Washington. \"The four cabinet members voiced their objections that bringing the treaty to a referendum was unconstitutional,\" a senior official said. Congressman Raul Roco, assistant majority leader in the lower house, said 69 of the 205 lawmakers must approve the impeachment charges. But the measure stood no chance of approval since pro-Aquino congressmen control three-quarters of the seats in the chamber. Under the constitution, impeachment charges are prepared by the lower house while the impeachment trial is conducted by the Senate. President Aquino's chief-of-staff, Mr Franklin Drilon, said Manila expected Washington to maintain the level of compensation paid for Clark air base and Subic naval station under the old bases accord, which reached $481m (Â£284.6m) a year. But Mr Stanley Schrager, the US embassy spokesman, said Washington would only fulfil aid commitments in 1992 of $8363m. He indicated the amount might decline sharply in 19938.",

   "text_content" : "RIGADIER Jeronimo Mala- gueta has been in Maputo for the past nine months, quar tered at the Italian compound, over- looking the sea. He and his col- leagues in the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR) are now the acceptable face of a guerrilla force which has won little more than noto- riety in its long war against the Fre- limo government of Mozambique. While most of the brigadier's com- rades, including the MNR's leader, Mr Afonso Dhlakama, are still wag- ing war in the bush, Brig Malagueta seems to have settled into the capi- tal. He is part of a Joint Verification Commission set up to monitor a par- tial ceasefire agreed last December between the two sides. The \"mini-ceaseflre\" along Mozam- bique's transport corridors began to founder in February but the commis- sion limps on. Ten countries, includ- Jeremy Harding reports on slender strands of hope that the country could end its reliance on food aid ing Britain, are represented, but their role in the peace process is marginal for as long as talks in Rome between the government and the MNR fall to bear fruit. The war, meanwhile, has brought destitution to a third of Mozambi- que's 16m citizens and shattered sub- sistence farming, already misman- aged by Frelimo in its first 10 years of power. If a settlement remains elusive, the MNR in Maputo is taking no responsibility for the impasse. \"From our side,\" says Brig Mala- gueta, \"We have always wanted negotiations. One is looking for a way to secure a durable peace.\" In the absence of that, a legion of foreign donors and aid agencies in Maputo has poured money into the country with the result that its receipts in official development assistance now account for around three quarters of gross national product. Beyond the confines of the city, however, this has done little to revi- talise the small-farms sector, which is the key to ending hunger in Mozambique and which can only thrive once the war is over. What exists at present is referred to as a \"structural emergency\". In plain language, this is a long-term food shortage, verging on famine in some areas, which the aid agencies keep on their books as a rolling appeal from one year to the next For 1991, 290,000 tonnes of food ire required for 1.9m peopie. Mozambique is still a patchwork A no-go areas, frequented by the MNR, and outposts of government ontrol, mostly provincial capitals or istrict resettlement centres, where ural dwellers are herded together to wait for food aid. Fear of the MNR, which is not iscouraged by official reports of trocities, leads many Mosambicans o flee to government centres: when ebels butchered about 50 people in ;ampula province after an nslaught at the end of June, the leath toll was instead quoted as ,000. It is clear, too, that for Frelimo, which has no real military capacity, rsettlement had served a strategic \"rpose. The MNR likes to occupy Wtile areas where civilians can be fragooned into fetching and carry ng, and supplying its fighters. Gov- eminent forces nave respondea Dy depopulating the countryside - a policy which has worsened the effects of the emergency. There are signs that this many now be changing. In Zambezia and Nampula provinces, a militia force raised by a popular eccentric, who \"vaccinates\" his followers against bullets, has cleared the MNR from large tracts of countryside. Frelimo is urging people to return and culti- vate the newly available land. The move comes at a time when crime is rising in the over-populated centres and food distribution is breaking down: pilfering and fight- ing over grain is common and out- right theft by hungry government troops is on the increase. Indeed in most of the country, anyone with a gun and the remains of a uniform is a potential hazard to civilians. The enthusiasm with which dis- placed people are returning to the land, and its fertility in much of Zambezia, can produce startling results. However, only a fraction of the country's displaced are moving back. Meanwhile, the bullet-proof militia has begun to suffer setbacks at the hands of the MNR, which makes the future of the liberated areas uncertain. With more names appearing on a list of alleged coup plotters, Maputo is deeply engrossed in its own busi- ness. Elsewhere the country is on its knees and the emergency looks set to continue for as long as the war. Unlike Angola, where Washington and Moscow enforced the peace in May, Mozambique lacks the feverish cold war history and potential wealth to bring in the big brokers. Yet, without some similar involve- ment from outside, the spiral of war and hunger has no visible end."

   "article_dc_title" : "Hawke Goes Back on His Decision to Visit S Africa",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown MR BOB HAWKE, the *Australian prime minister, yes- terday cancelled a proposed visit to South Africa, saying it would be inappropriate in view of concerns over the pace of reform. Mr Hawke had intended to visit South Africa Immediately before the Commonwealth heads of government meeting on October 16 in Harare, capi- tal of neighbouring Zimbabwe. He would have been the first prominent western leader to visit South Africa since the process of reform was initiated by President P.W. de Klerk. However, Mr Hawke said he had decided not to go because he was not satisfied that South Africa was moving quickly enough towards constitutional change and the establishment of non-racial government. \"While great things have been done by the government of South Africa, and it would be churlish not to acknowledge it, the process has not been as rapid and as determined as I think we all would have liked,\" he said. \"In those circum- stances I did not think it was appropriate to go.\" South African police said yesterday that two dozen officers had been suspended and seven of them charged with murder or assault in connection with political vio- lence, AP reports from Johannesburg. The announcement fol- lowed the weekend signing of a peace accord that set codes of conduct for security forces and political parties. Australia was a strong sup- porter of the implementation of Commonwealth sanctions against South Africa. It has also been in the forefront of moves to relax sanptions since,, the reform process began. Mr Hawke is expected to argue at the Cominonwealth meeting for an end to sanc- tions affecting individu- als - such as visa restrictions and scientific and cultural exchanges. However, his decision not to visit South Africa signals that Australia is unlikely to support a relaxation of economic sanc- tions. Mr Hawke said Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, would visit Canberra soon, probably in early Octo- ber. Mr Botha's visit will be the first visit to Australia by a South African minister for more than 20 years. It follows a trip to South Africa in June by Senator Gareth Evans, the first Australian minister to go there since 1948. Mr Hawke's decision to can- cel his South African trip was welcomed by Mr Eddie Funde, the African National Council representative in Australia. However, Mr Funde said the Australian government should not accept a visit from Mr Botha. \"Our position is that Austra- lia should not invite him here because he is representing a white man's government, not an interim government for all South Africans,\" Mr Funde said. Mr David Tothill, the South African ambassador to Can- berra, said he regarded Mr Hawke's decision not to go to South Africa as a postpone- ment rather than a cancella- tion.

The allegatiom was made by Mr David Hill, managing director of the .government owned Australian Broadcast ing Corporation (ABC) daring evidence to a parliamentary select committee in Wellings- ton, New Zealand. Mr Hill, a prominent anti- smoking camaigner, Mid the company had targeted spur-s commentators, camera crews, ground staff, promoters and organisers. \"Marketin staff would get in beside these people and make side deals, offers of travel, accommodation, costs, arranging for wives and fami- lies to travel, overseas trips, holidays, gifts and booze, cash etc in return for assistance in promotion. \"People who were helpful were well looked after on a continuing basis with dinners, parties, social functions, tick- ets to events, travel with teams etc,\" he said. Mr Hill said he had learnt of the \"widespread practice of bribery\" from a staff member of the ABC who had formerly worked as a senior official of WD and HO Wills in New Zea land. The official made the revela- tions during an internal review of ABC guidelines for broadcasting of tobacco-spon- sored sports events in Austra- lia, and later drew up a signe-d statement describing the sys- tem, Mr Hill said. He refused to name the official but offered to provide a copy of the report. WD and HO Wills said there was \"no truth whatsoever\" in the allegations, and claimed Mr Hill's reluctance to name the official meant he was not confident they were true. In April 1989 BAT took direct control of Wills, the remainder of the shares in which are quoted on the Australipp stock exchange. Previously Wills was a subsidiary of Amatil, the Australian soft drinks group which was itself a 41 per cent affiliate of BAT. It was not clear to what period- the allegations related. The committee is consider- ing whether sports sponsor- ship should be exempt under New Zealand's Smoke Free Environment Act, which bans most tobacco-related advertis- ig rand sponsorship.",

The London headquarters of the VAT Administration Direc- torate handles 6,000 to 7,000 written queries and 200,000 telephone inquiries a year. Mr Richard Allen, director of internal taxes, said most of these could be dealt with locally. If a query over liability of goods and services for VAT is sent in written form to head office it may take as much as three months to be resolved. Under the VAT directorate's Strategy for Change pro- gramme, such inquiries would be dealt with either immedi- ately or within a few days by local VAT officials. MIr Allen said the volume of routine inquiries to head office had prevented the Inspectorate from improving training of local staff. It had also meant it had not been able t provide advice in the form of guidance notes and interpretations of VAT law for local offces. Mrs Gillian Shephard, minis- ter of state at the Treasury, said small bUsinesses in partic- ular should benefit from faster rulings on VAT affairs from local officials. Organisations representing smallbusinesses welcomed thee proposals. The National Seder- ation of the Self Employed and Small Businesses, however, said it feared that local deci- sion-maldking would mean less consistent rulings. Mr Richard Watson, a part- ner at accountants Price Waterhouse, said many busi- nesses and their advisers pre- ferred to deal with the head office because of a concentra- tion of expertise in London. The VAT directorate intends to put plans for implnementing the programme to the board of Customs and Excise in Novem- ber and to start putting it into practice in early 1992.",

The scheme pays some or all of the fees for privately educa- ting children from low-income homes. Mr Straw, speaking to the annual meeting of the Headmasters' Conference at Cambridge, said the scheme had proved \"an expensive fail ure\". He quoted research show ing that only 10 per cent of the 27,000 pupils on assisted places had fathers who were manual workers. Sixty-eight per cent of mothers and 51 per cent of fathers of such pupils had been to private or selective schools. That meant that fewer than 3,000 children from manual workers' families benefited from the scheme. Mr Straw challenged the independent school head teach- ers to provide for 600 children from manual workers' families from their own resources. Brother Tom Sreenan, head of St Anselm's College, Birken- head, replied that more than 200 of the 800 pupils at his school received assisted places, 110 of whom had all their fees paid because family income fell below Â£8,700 a year. Mr Simon Dawkins, head of Merchant Taylor's School, Liverpool, said 30 per cent of his pupils were on the scheme."

Further meetings are planned for early October to tie up loose threads and review the effect of the decisions on the ITV network. Then the commission will consider the confidential cash bids that in most cases will determine the outcome. Bidders have been clutching at every communica- tion from the nIC to see if any secrets can be gleaned. London Independent Broad- casting, a consortium of inde- pendent producers that has outbid the incumbent London Weekend Television, was over- joyed recently to receive que- ries about its business plan. Surely the inquiry meant IB was still in contention? And industry watchers will read much into the fact that TV-ams, the breakfast television company, recently offered to provide Channel 4's breakfast news service if TV-am lost its franchise. Channel 4, however, declined the offer. Yet Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am's chief executive, am, has been exuding confidence even though both his rivals, Sunrise and Daybreak, have outbid him. Has he had a nudge or a wink or is he just an optimist? Gege BRisell: good at keeping a seret, but may have some surprises up ms sleeve 'The only safe bet is that no one knows what the commis inon plans to do and that the odds are against anynefind- ing out before the= are announced, probably in the week beginning October 15. However, the leaking of most of the confidential bids reveals two difficult issues facing the commission. It must decide what to do about the six ITV companies that have outbid the opposi tion: TVS Entertainment, Tele- vision South West, Tyne Tees Yorkshire, HTV, and Anglia. The bids are high, but the companies have all used respectable consultants to fore- cast their advertising revenue. with the possible exception of TVS, which has bid nearly Â£60m a year in 1993 prices, probably more than Â£20m a year above its nearest rival, the six are likely to make it. Even TVS has a slightly better than even chance of joining them. If it keeps its franchise, Time Warner, the world's larg- est media group, Canal Plus, the French TV company, and Associated Newspapers have agreed to take part in a Â£30m refinancing. If TVS is excluded on the basis of its business plan, the company would go for a judi- cial review and the commis- sion might find itself having to prove why its advertising reve- nue forecasts were better than those offered by TVS. Nine IV companies might therefore be safe - the six plus Central, Scottish and Border, which were unopposed. If high bids are accepted from incumbents, it is difficult to see how Sunrise and Day- break can be excluded on financial grounds. It is equally difficult to see how Sunrise - whose shareholders include LWT, Scottish and Disney - and Daybreak - backed by Independent Television News, NBC, The Daily Telegraph and Carlton Communications - might both fail the quality test. It looks as if Sunrise, which has marginally outbid Day- break, has a good chance of winning TV-am's franchise. Three small ITV companies, Ulster, Grampian and Channel, are thought to have been out- bid and one or more mWigo. The ITC's other e e is what to do about the three I.-copmsie - Granada, M7 and Thames - thathave been outbid. The Industry ft&ds it diffloult to believe that all three will be allowed to go. This autumn, Thames astone Is providing 47.5 per cent 0! the weekday schedule between 6130pm and 10J0pm, excluding news, sport, films and local programming. The figure for Granada Is 205 per cent. The betting in the industry is that Granada will see off North West Television, and that LWT will beat UB by a whisker. In both cases the quality threshold would be the most likely means used to exclude the higher bidder. The largest question mark hang over Thames, which is the biggest ITV company. Not only has it been outbid, but Carlton Communications, the television production and ser- vices company, Is probably the strongest outside bidder. Thames hopes the ITC will use its power to invoke \"excep- tional circumstances\" to save it. The commission will be reluctant to do so if it can be avoided because of the likell- hood that it will lead to a Judi- cdal review. If Thames, TV-am and two small regional companies lose their franchises, both the ITC and the government could jus- tify the process. The government would have got what it wanted - up to Â£300m extra a year - and Mr Russell would have delivered change without destabilising the ITV system. The commission, while main- taining its reputation for secrecy, may also have inher- ited the IBA's ability to come up with surprises.",

The satellite television company, which broadcasts five channels, is to launch a comedy channel at the begin- ning of next month, to be financed by advertising. The channel, transmitted by the Astra satellite system, will be scrambled for copyright reasons and available only to film-channel subscribers, although at no extra charge. Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, a company in which Pearsqn, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake, said not enough comedy programmes were available to British viewers. The channel, which will run from 4pm to midnight daily, will include BBC comedies such as Dad's Army and The Goodies. At the end of August, Mr Davey said, BSkyB was available to 2,404,000 UK homes through satellite dishes and all forms of cable. Homes with satellite dishes totalled 1.64m. A total of 1,287,000 homes subscribed to at least one film channel by all meth- ods of distribution. There were slightly more than 1m subscribers in homes with satellite dishes, with 568,000 sub- scribing to both filmn channels at a cost of Â£14.99 a month.",

The Scots-born lord chancel- lor, making a rare political speech to Conservatives in Arbroath, Tayside, said any such move would bring no benefits to Scotland. Lord Mackay said parallels between Scotland and the Bal- tic states, which have become independent, were \"ludicrous\". Scotland did not have a one- party system that denied polit- ical freedom. The Scottish National party (SNP)policy of independence within in the EC would give Scotland less influence than it has as part of the UK. * At the SNP annual confer- ence yesterday Mrs Margaret Ewing, the party's parliamen- tary leader, attacked Lord MacKay's \"dreary predictable hogwash\". She added: \"It is hypocritical drivel for Tories to welcome the independence of the Baltic states and predict a European Community of up to 30 members, but then turn round and tell Scots we are not good enough to be one of them.\" Earlier on the first day of the conference, in Inverness, a target date for Independence of January 1993 was set."

   "text_content" : "T HiE imminent opening of the Channel tunnel is L the factor underlying the drastic cost-cutting mea- sures announced by Sealink Stena Line, the UK ferry opera- tor, yesterday. The company is cutting 1,569 jobs and axing its Folkestone-Boulogne route by the end of the year. With just 21 months to go to the planned opening date for the Channel tunnel, passengers and goods travelling between the UK and the Continent will soon be presented with a means of crossing the Channel that is not just quicker and easier than the ferries, but cheaper. That is because the tunnel, unlike the ferries, will combine high fixed costs with relatively low operating costs, so it will serve its owners' interests to chase volume by undercutting the ferries. In the short space between now and June 1993, therefore, the ferry operators have to bring their costs down to a level that will enable them to enter a price war with the tun- nel owners without being driven out of business. P&O European Ferries, mar- ket leader on UK-Continental routes, with 51 per cent of the passenger journeys in 1990, has already taken pre-emptive action. In 1988 it provoked a damaging and painful bout of industrial action when it insisted on changes to restric- tive and outdated working practices on its ferries. The company emerged from the dispute with 800 fewer sea- farers and a great deal of lin- Richard Tomkins looks at the background to Sealink Stena's decision to cut 1,500 jobs gering acrimony - but in far better shape to cope with the looming competitive threat of the tunnel. The task that faces Sealink is far greater. Where P&O's ferry operations have their roots in an entrepreneurial business set up by the private sector, Sealink's lie in the inef- ficient and unproductive own- ership of British Rail. Only in 1984 did it emerge from the state sector, when it was privatised through a trade sale to Sea Containers, the shipping and container rental group. Sea Containers had still failed to eliminate Sealink's extensive overmanning and restrictive working practices by the start of 1989, when it faced a hostile bid from Stena, the Swedish ferry group, and Tiphook, the UK container company. Fourteen months later the bid was resolved when Sea Containers surrendered its con- tainer interests to Tiphook and its Sealink ferry operations to Stena. But eyebrows were raised among other ferry oper- ators when they learned that the price extracted for Sealink was Â£080m. The industry's suspicions that the price was too high were confirmed by Stena's rev- elation on Tuesday that It faces a pre-tax loss of SKr800Sm (Â£282m) this year against the previous year's severely depressed profits of SKr107m -almost wholly because of Sealink's poor performance. Stena cannot be accused of having failed to address Sea- link's productivity shortcom- ings. In October 1990, just six months after acquiring the company, it announced a twin- track programme of 849 job cuts and Â£178m worth of investment in vessels and routes in an attempt to improve market position. The programme, however, has backfired. Growth in traf- sic volumes has fallen far short of the level needed to fill the extra capacity and only 400 of the job cuts have been achieved, with the rest bogged down in union talks. About 37 per cent of Sealink's reve- nue is still absorbed in staff costs, compared with an aver- age of 25 per cent for other UK ferry operators. The consequent losses now appear to have injected a sense of urgency into Sealink. Mr Gareth Cooper, managing director, was probably not exaggerating yesterday when he said that the company's sur- vival depended on drastic cuts in its costs. The prize, if the restructur- ing works, goes beyond the immediate improvement in Sealink's financial perfor- mance. If its cost base can be Main UK ferry routes Irish a lOM routes\" B&I rt.

The dangers of failure are real. The opening of the tunnel will provide massive new capacity alongside the ferry operators' busiest and most profitable routes. Not even the most optimistic forecasts of traffic growth suggest demand will grow to meet the increased supply. Signs of the inevitable rationalisation are gathering pace. Just a week ago, P&O announced that it was with- drawing its passenger ferries on the Dover-Zeebrugge route from December 31. Drastic though the latest measures by ferry operators may be, they probably mark only the opening shots in the looming battle. There is simply not enough room for the tun- nel and all the existing ferries on the short sea routes between Britain and France. The weak will not survive: and on current showing, Sealink is looking vulnerable.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivor Owen, Parliamentary Correspondent LABOUR HAS overtaken the Conservatives as the party the public regards as most likely to introduce effective measures to counter rising crime, Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home sec- retary, said yesterday. He quoted opinion polls com- missioned by Labour and \"anecdotal evidence\" to say that law and order could no longer be regarded as a prime vote-winning issue for the Con- servatives. Mr Hattersley emphasised that recorded crime had dou- bled in the 12 years of Conser- vative government, and reaf- firmed that a Labour government would impose a statutory responsibility on local authorities to devote more resources to crime pre- vention. Some groups, includ- ing many pensioners, regarded measures to reduce burglary and other crime as more important than securing eco- nomic growth, he said. Mr Hattersley attacked Mr Kenneth Baker, the home sec- retary, for failing to act on an Internal Home Office report advocating an overall crime- prevention policy that closely mirrored Labour proposals. Labour had learnt from \"informed sources\" that an embarrassed government intended to ignore the report. Mr Hattersley said: \"For the crime rates in this country to ifall to an acceptable low, fun damental changes need to be made - in attitudes and insti- tutions, environments and prespects - which will not easily or swiftly come about.\" He maintained that the actions of \"yuppies\" in the financial services sector at the time of Big Bang, shown on television drinking from chainm- :azne bottles and breakine them before discarding them in the Thames, had contributed to the build-up of an anti-social atmosphere. \"The borderline between that and vandalism on council estates is not very broad.\" He accused the government of having consistently followed a policy of \"every man for him- self\" and contended that some crime was an extension of the philosophy that had beer openly advocated as the way to national success. Mr Hattersley said the Home Office report that Mr Baker intended to shelve highlighted the government's failure to devise a social crime- prevention policy to tackle the causes of crime. It had also criticised the government's failure to develop an agency that could take a leadership role in crime prevention. ManagmeMnt, Pag 10",

   "text_content" : "vy Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent NISSAN UK, the privately owned distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, yesterday accused Nissan Motor, the Jap- anese car maker, of prema- turely cutting its supply of new vehicles. The manufacturer has termi- nated NUK's exclusive distri- bution contract from the end of the year and is setting up its own distribution operation through,a subsidiary, Nissan Motor (GB). The latest conflict concerns supply of vehicles during 1991. NUK is seeking to build up new-car stocks to keep its deal- ers supplied partly into 1992, while Nissan Motor wants to minimise the overlap of paral- lel supply networks. As NUK's new vehicle stocks fall, time is running out for Mr Octav Botnar, NUK's chairman and chief executive, to find alternative franchises for his dealer network. NUK claimed that, of the 80,000 vehicles it had ordered in 1991, Nissan Motor had agreed to supply only 41,000, and had refused to supply vehicles in November and December. Nissan Motor said last night that the NUK claims were \"frivolous, untruthful and manifestly an attempt to dis- credit Nissan and to prejudice Nissan Motor (GB)'s start-up in January 1992.\" It would con- tinue to supply vehicles to NUK In November and Decem- ber.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans THE CASE for more protection of intellectual property through patents and copyright has not yet been made conclu- sively, the National Consumer Council says in a paper pub- lished yesterday. The NCC argues that, far from encouraging investment in research and development and encouraging innovation, giving companies a monopoly over designs for a period might discourage innovation. It could mean higher prices to consumers and delay the benefits of standardisation. It might also cause economic loss to developing countries. The international regulation of trade and intellectual prop- erty - information with com- mercial value including patents, design rights, copy- right and trade marks - is a contentious issue in current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations and in the European Community. According to the NCC, man- ufacturers, before being given increased protection for intel- lectual property, should prove that the lorg-term henefts of encouraging increased innova- tion really do outweigh the short-term costs of increased prices and reduced choice. The council calls on the European Commission to pub- lish a programme of indepen- dent studies into the costs and benefits to the EC economy and consumers of measures to protect intellectual property, starting with pharmaceuticals. It concedes that pharmaceu- ticals may be a special case because of the high cost of research and development ana the ease of copyin&g but that \"needs further investigation\". Studies of the pharmaceuti- cal and computer software industries demonstrated that increased protection tended to disadvantage consumers by increasing prices, or restricting access to and choice of prod- ucts, or by stifling innovation and standardisation.

The move follows wide- spread concern among lawyers at the low levels of ethnic- minority representation in senior positions in the legal profession. Lord Mackay has responded to criticism from the Bar and the Law Society by saying he is anxious to appoint more eth- nic-minority judges and QCs, but that he can appoint only from the available pool of suit- ably qualified lawyers. At pres- ent, he says, he has no means of knowing how many suitable ethnic-minority candidates the are are. Of the Bar's 6,000 practising barristers, 6 per cent are drawn from ethnic minorities. Only 1 -per cent of the 48,000 practising solicitors in England and Wales fall into that cateory. There are no ethnic-minority Law Lords, Court of Appeal or HIigh Court judges and only two ethnic-minority circuit judges out of 440.

Northumbria Tec, one of the most radical of the 82 new Tecs in England and Wales, has an option to buy the Longhirst estate, a grade-two listed build- ing and 44 acres of parkland, EMPLOYMENT outside Morpeth. The Tec is waiting for planning permis- sion from Castle Morpeth Bor- ough Council. Tecs, which are responsible for delivery of government- funded training schemes, are constituted as private compa- nies and have the right to set up commercial subsidiaries. The Longhirst campus, which would cost more than Â£5m to develop, would be the most ambitious commercial enterprise started by a Tec. Most are restricting themselves to small-scale business activi- ties, including consultancy. The Longhirst campus would include a training and confer- ence centre, and would provide higher education concentrating on courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in sec- tors particularly relevant to Northumbria. Such courses would include tourism, land use, quality management and business studies. Mr Stephen Cowell, chief executive of Northumbria Tec which has a budget this year of Â£14m, said the project would be funded from a variety of sources. They would include accumulated Tec resources, the European Community, private investors and banks. He said his board was ada- mant that the Tec was not an \"egg-timer\", receiving govern- ment money and handing it out to other organisations. He said: \"Our long-term goal is to establish the Tec as an independent company with a business that is not totally dependent on government funding. We want to create our own businesses that are com- mercially viable and perhaps bigger than the Tec itself.\"",

Wharfedale, based in Bees- ton, Leeds, pleaded guilty to not testing noise levels, failing to provide earplugs, failing to provide noise warning signs and not training employees about the danger of high noise levels. It was fined a total of Â£525 with Â£150 costs. Mtr Ian Cook, prosecutor for the Health and Safety Execu- tive, told Leeds magistrates that a factory inspector had found workers testing disco speakers enduring noises up to 120 decibels. The court heard that during an eight-hour shift, workers who had been testing the speakers for about 18 months were suffering an average of ill decibels - 400 times above the legal limit of 85 on the non- linear decibel scale. Mr Cook said: \"The unfortu- nate result of exposure to high noise levels can be severe deaf ness and . .. the distressing condition of tinnitus.\" He said workers would need to be exposed to levels of 111 deci- bels for two years for their hearing to suffer. The company said the prose- cution had come about because of ignorance about noise legis- lation. The company had implemented all the factory inspector's recommendations after his visit. Mr John Onyett, magis- trates' chairman, said the fine was low because Wharfedale had taken positive action to reduce noise levels.",

Four ye1rs ag o the erltish Labour party's surprisingly slick, authoritative campaign won widespread cormical acclaim but was not translated into enough votes to makei a significant dentin the Conser- vaties' comfortable majority. It did, at least, help to ensure that te two-headed challenge from the erstwhile Alliance - whose symbol' at the time might have been the pushme- pullyou - did not propel Labour into a disastrous third place in terms of votes cast, as almost occurred in 1983. For the forthcoming election, the party leadership believes that its painstaking policy review - which inter alta has seen Labour ditch its commit- ment to unilateral nuclear dis- armament - should retrieve enough lost votes to make it electable. In marketing parl- ance, the product as well as the packaging promise to appeal. As the body charged with hitching specialist marketing, polling, advertising and PR expertise to the Labour band- wagon, the largely volunteer SCA has played a key role in the party's late-1980s transfor- mation. This has gone far beyond masterminding that mould-breaking 1987 campaign. For example, the agency oversaw the extensive market research programm that pro vided the outlne of voter opin- ions and aspirations with the help of wnich current policy was formulated. It has also been credited with a host of image-building moves from the adoption of the now ubiquitous red rose as the party's emblem to Neil Kin- nock's shift to shorter hair and darker suits. Thanks to its success in delivering a uniformly high standard of work on a limited budget, the SCA has aroused much curiosity over the past four years. Among the biggest mysteries is its composition: just who are the dedicated band of specialists who volun- teer their skills? The SCA's hub has long been the BMPDDB Needham adver- tising agency - formerly Boase Massimi Pollitt. BMP first caught the eye of the political left with its anti-aboli- tion campaign on behalf of Ken Lvingstone's Greater London Council. \"It is hard to overesti- mate the importance of the GLC campaign; it made adver- tising politically acceptable to the left,\" says Peter Herd, BMs - former business diAcn tor. BMP supplieda many of the SCA volunteers, includin Christopher Powell, its crent chief executive, and hosted several of its meetings. \"The red rose first appeared at BMP,\" recalls one media strate ist who has againvolunteered to be pressed into service in the forthcoming campaign. The BMP connection also elps to explain the SCA's pen- chant for secrecy. \"There were a lot of people on the BMP board who would have been uncomfortable about working for an agency corporately ban. ding the Labour party,\" Peter ::rd recalls. \"So we did it as a substantial part of a group called the Shadow Communica- tions Agency. It was better for BMP and better for Labour because they didn't have to pay.\" \"What you are getting above all is commitment and that is not necessarily something you can go out and buy,\" says Tony Page, a former assistant in shadow cabinet member Jack Cunningham's office. In the phrase of Colin Byrne, Labour's chief press officer, the unpaid helpers enable the party -to avoid \"the Heinz abns syndrome\". By this 1e means the tendency of adver- tsinig agencies to concentrate their bt talent on the most lucrative accounts Coordinating the efforts o9f me volunteers and idterpreting meir f indns to the party a: age since early days have bDen Philip Gould, a communi- cations and marketing special ist whose company - Philip Gould Associates - boasted Iabour as its principal but not eiclusive client, and Peter aendelson, until recently the party's powerful communica tions director. J\" ould remains a key fig * ure, reporting direct to - party general secretary Larry Whitty on financial mat- ters. However, Mandelson's day-to-day involvement with the agency has stopped since he departed Labour's Wal- worth Road headquarters. Responsibility for commission- ing creative work now rests with David Hill, the new com- munications director. Before the 1987 election, an important part of Mandelson's role was to protect the volun- teers from the still powerful voices within the pa\"ty who saw the changed attitude to marketing, as symptomatic of Labour's betrayal of its social- st ideals and viewed the SCA with scepticism or outright hostility. \"As far as possible, Peter tried to interpose himself between the agency and the politicians,\" says Tony Page. \"I think that was sensible; some of the people involved who were offering their services free had had very limited access to the party and he didn't want them to be put of by those who were hostile.\" Over the past two or so years, the agency has faded rather more into the back- ground partly because of its volunteer-based format and partly because certain tasks - for example, schooling MPs in media-handling techniques - need only to be carried out once. \"I am doing less now than I was because the party has its act together more in terms of media relations,\" explains one volunteer. Qualitative market research is, however, conducted pretty much continually, agency insiders say, while Gould is qi te clqpsely involved JIn \"a ilkepolicy document aue5s . IBy-ectio consti- tute one area which does. not genetally receive the full SCA treatment. \"Because we were usitg volunteers from the top' agencies, we couldn't call on their services except on big camaignsm,\" says Peter Herd. With an undeniably big cam- paign now almost upon the electorate, the question is \"Can the SCA again come up with the goods?\" Certainly, Mandelson's departure has been a source of concern to some Labour sunp- porters who saw him as the indispensable llnchpin bonding the agency to the party leader- ship. The surprise resignation in June of his successor as communications director John Underwood will have reinforced such misgivings, although an air of stability now appears to have been restored under David Hill. Others are worried, despite Neil Kinnock's re-emerging image problem, that the SCA might be perceived as having done its job too well. \"Ironi- cally, now the worry is that the presentation is too slick and the policies are too bland,\" says one volunteer. This point has not been lost on the Liberal Democrats who have recently taken to portray- ing their two principal rivals as much of a muchness in pol- icy terms. It remains to be seen whether Labour's recent slip- page in the opinion polls is an indication that it has not been lost on the electorate either.

   "text_content" : "Guy de Jonquieres reports that national differences are likely to survive the implications of 1992 rowing public resistance to advertising, fragmentation of the mass media and the persistence of local differeices in demand will make pan-European marketing of consumer goods diff- cult and costly even after 1992, according to a joint report* by the Henley Centre and Research Inter- national. Though the trend towards more pan-European products is likely to continue, the report finds little evi- dence that a new class of \"Euro- consumers\" is emerging. The same products will often need to be posi- tioned differently in national mar- kets to reflect local preferences. The main lesson for suppliers is not that they need pursue wholly separate marketing strategies in each country, but that they should remain closely attuned to local influences and be ready to adapt quickly. The report, based on a survey of 7,000 consumers in six EC coun- tries - Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain - last spring, is claimed to be the most comprehensive of its kind ypublishe. It was funde by 12 large companies, including Guin- ness, Jaguar, Kodak and Unilever. Though the survey reveals some attitudes common to consumers in much of the EC - such as declining expectations of what governments can deliver, growing concern with health and rising racist sentiments - it finds their outlook on many issues remains overwhelmingly shaped by national and regional influences. There is no evidence of any widespread convergence around a common European popu- lar culture - other than American flms and television - and the idea of a shared European \"identity\" has limited popular support, even among young people. Of the six nationalities inter- viewed, only in the Netherlands and Spain did more people say that, if they had to live abroad, they would choose another EC country rather than the US, Canada or Aus- tralia. The preference for these three countries is particularly strong among those aged 16-24. Support for removal of EC border controls is also patchy, ranging from around 40 per cent in the UK and Italy to 70 per cent or more In Spain and Germany. Only in Ger- many is it ranked a more important priority than a single currency. While strong brands remain vital to successful marketing, building them is increasingly complicated by the fragmentation of audiences, shorter product development times and a proliferation of new products which consumers find confusing. Furthermore, though increased competition is stimulating higher advertising expenditure, consumer apathy is dlminirhin its effective- ness. Fewer than half of all women said they knew which brands they would buy before visiting a super- market. At least 80 per cent of those interviewed did not want more commercials on television, while in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands a quarter or less of consumers welcomed direct mail promotions. Producers are advised to focus their approach by developing more sophisticated databases on target customers, placing more emphasis on in-store advertising and tying marketing to \"life cycle events\" such as a first job, marriage and buying a first home. The survey reveals demand for greater choice in retailing. In the UK, for Instance, more consumers than in any other EC country said they wanted outlets selling cheaper food. However, only in non-food lines is expansion of retailers across European borders expected to result in greater co-ordination of buying policy, formats and mer- chandise. An important hurdle to positioning consumer products is the wide divergence between the association of price with quality. The relationship appears weakest in France and strongest in Spain. Only 5 per cent of French con- sumers believed that the dearest wine was also of the highest qual- ity, against three quarters of Span- iards. Asked about insurance poli- cies, the responses were 19 per cent and 48 per cent respectively. Relatively more consumers in France than in any part of the EC except eastern Germany also said they bought products such as wash- ing powder, biscuits and spirits because they were the cheapest available. The tendency to choose the best regardless of price is stron- gest in Italy. Perceptions of quality also vary widely, with a widespread assump- tion among consumers that their own countries' products are best. However, this belief is far weaker among well-travelled consumers. In every country, more of the recent travellers than non-travellers agreed that Germany made the best sausages and cars, and France the best cosmetics. The report warns, however, against sweeping generalisations. In some cases, the North-South divide is the main influence on con- sumer attitudes, but in others it can be age, education or income. \"The point is that there is no single way of clustering consumers - it depends on what the issue is.\" * Frontiers: planning for consumer change in Europe.

Declining federal assis ance, lower tax revenues and ncreasing public debt have reduced the amount of federal snd local government fund; available to the public sector. At the same time, states and municipalities face a desperate need to rebuild schools, hospi Isals, bridges, roads, airports, water facilities and other infra structure. The result is tha: more state governments are trning to the private sectoz or help. The state governments' criti. cal needs have given an ims us to privatisation initiatives, Last year California awarded concessions to private develop. er to build $2.bn of toll roads.

The use of private companies to dispose of sludge from sew- age treatment plants is also growing. New Jersey is work- ing to create the country's first sludge disposal utility - a $400m privately developed-and- owned facility. A number of coastal cities are also exploring privatisation of sludge disposal services fol- lowing a federal ban on ocean dumping which comes into effect at the end of this year.

One such example is recre ation facilities. A recent report by Arthur D Little, the accoun tants, indicates that 18 per cent of convention centres and 17 per cent of sports stadia are operated by the private sector. The company forecasts that 5060 per cent of these facilities will eventually be privatised. The Miami Beach Conven- tion Centre and the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City were among other facilities considered for privatisation last year; the Spectacor Management Group recently concluded talks with the relevant authorities to take over the operation of both cen- tres. Spectacor, which has man- aged the Los Angeles Coliseum since 1988, also agreed last year to finance a $150m renova- tion of the stadium in return for a long-term lease of the facility. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that $800bn is needed in additional spending on infrastructure to 2000; only 5624bn has so far been allo- cated by state and local author- ities. Governments at all levels acknowledge that the shortfall will have to be made up by private sector. Any private sec- tor involvement will therefore be the key that also unlocks through privatisation the bil- lions of dollars invested in state and local government a ts which are currently idle. The federal government, rec- gnising these needs and opportunities, is taking steps to speedup privatisation.

   "text_content" : "By Davld Waler UK ACCOUNTANTS are demoralised. They are going throuh the most seri- ous recession the p esion has expe- rienced since the Second World War and their public standing is at a low ebb in the wake of large numbers of corporate collapses, many of which exposed the limitations of accoun- tants and accounting in a dramatic way. But they should take consolation from the fact that things are not nearly so bad as they are in North America. A recently issued book, published in the US and entitled \"The Big Six\", with the menacing sub-title \"The Sell- ing Out of America's Top Accounting Firms\", exposes in colourful terms the dire state of the US profession today. There have been mass sackings of US partners at KPMG Peat Marwick and the collapse of two large medium- sized firms (Laventhol & Horwath and Spicer & Oppenheim), as readers of this column will know, but the mal- aise goes deeper than that. The book, by Mark Stevens, paints a lurid picture of what the blurb describes as a \"scandalous diminution in professional standards, a rash of audit failures, and a decrease in the public's trust and confidence in their services\". In the UK, a total of 45 listed com- panies landed up in the hands of administrators, receivers or liquida- tors of during 1989 and 1990, among them some very large companies, such as British & Commonwealth, Coloroll and Polly Peck, and a hand- ful of erstwhile stock-market favour- ites such as Sock Shop and Parkfield. In every case, the auditors have come in for criticism, but this has been mild compared with the condem- nation visited on Us naccouitants in the wake of the Savilip [4pms crisis, described as'the ravet US economic fiasco since the great stock market collapse of By the beginningof this ear, the US government had stepped nto res- cue more than 50 troupled aLs at a potential cost to the taxpayerof more than $1bn,.The consequence for the US Afrms was a welter of leglation which dwarfs the halndfl of awuits served against the UK firms by the beginning of 1090, the US govern- The central thesis is that new-found commercialism has compromised big firms' professionalism to the point where they are no longer fulfilling their obligation to US society ment's 12 largest claims against the Big Six claimed damages of a total of $1.5bn. \"In case after sordid case, insol- vency after insolvency, S&Ls blessed with a clean audit from the United States' premier public accounting firms have gone belly up only weeks or months after the auditors assured the world of their fiscal well-being.\" Stevens writes, \"Rather than acting in the legitimate capacity of trained sceptics licensed to serve as checks and balances on management asser- tions, all too often they simply rub- ber-stamped client statements, thus abrogating their duties as the public's watchdogs ..; Forget the all-too- comoimn excuidse that complex fraud coimitted by devious management in collusion with others is hard to detect. To people who invest in thrifts or who entrust their life savings to theni, this kind of don't-blame-us- If-the-bad-guys-are-real-smart bUck-passin is hardly what they have min when they see a Big Six signature blessing a financial state- ment.\" The central thesis of the book is that the new-found commercialism of the big firms has compromised their professionalism to the point where they are no longer fulfilling their obli- ation to society - they have forgot ten that they are supposed to bring the highest level of professionalism to their work in return for the right to opine on financial statements. Chapter after chapter details what is meant by \"new-found commercial- ism\": the willingness to compromise ethical standards in pursuit of profit; a readiness to exploit other firms' pro sessional difficulties with a client in order to secure new business; an eagerness to pitch for new business at apparently uneconomic levels. The thesis is illustrated with two case studies, one showing the demise of a fraudulent insurance company called ZZZZ Best and the other the collapse of the Beverly Hills Savings & Loan (BHSL). The latter owed its demise at least in part to the accounting treatment of property investments: classified as loans rather than equity, the S&L was able to recognise interest and fees as income as they fell due rather than when they were actually received in the form of cash. In fact, the loans were non-performing and the account- ing treatnment astene4 thedeslae of the SL. In the case of ZZZ Best, Stevens shows how the auditors were slow to exhibit ceptciis in the fde of grow- inga OVdncSP Of fraiud es ,Taree argume similar n the U iat the lack any equiva- lent to Duodc MCongrssional h Ã½es into.accoutancy nIrm su*ans it s exceptionlly rare that evidence as graphic as that ciatedby Stevenis sees he light of day. But induatry gossip suggests the widespread prevalence of The UK's accountants are proud of the skill with which they can handle conflicts of interest, but whether they can build Chinese walls in their heads is another matter \"low-balling\" - excessively zealous price competition among firms - and \"opinion shopping\", whereby compa- nies put pressure on their auditors by finding another firm willing to sanc- tion a controversial accounting treat- ment. Moreover it stands to reason that auditors find it difficult to be sceptical about the very people they are desper- ate to sell other services to, namely the incumbent management of their clients. The UK's accountants are proud of the skill with which they can handle conflicts of interest but whether they can build Chinese walls in their heads is another matter it stretches credulity to think that audi- tor can, on the one hand, treat ab audit assignment as a marketing opportunity and, on the other, eser l and partiality i chckng up n the client. Stevens lat into the trap of apply ing double standards to his asse ment of the firms: in his chapter on the remoulding of Deloitte, Hakins Sells under Mmie Cook, the US senlo partner who was later the architect ol the merger with Touche Ross, pro 19M5 Deloitte is derided for its ver lack of commercialim, for being old fashioned and stufy whilst Cook ii praised for being a \"business manage In accountant's clothing\" whc dragged Deloitte into the twentletd century. The commercialism the authoi praises here is what he condemns as the root of the profession's problemn in other chapters. Regulators of the profession in thi US, as in the UK, have tended tc assume that the public interest is served by opening the market is accountancy services to competition they then condemn the firms foi playing the new game with too muck vigour. Perhaps the public interesi would be served by placing restrictior on accountancy firms' freedom tc compete with one another - but ther the firms would be derided for being uncommercial. Partners in UK accountancy firmn will enjoy reading this book as 11 paints a lurid picture of where the profession on this side of the Atlantic may be heading.

   "text_content" : "waielthnt sytm at together and runs on more a on machine. In what could be a iimor- tant step towards achieving this, Unix International, a con- sortium of hardware and salt- ware companies formed three years ago by AT&T and Sun Microsystems has announced plans for a framework of speci- fications for \"oien systems\". The \"UI-Atlas\" encompasses a broad set of functions from transaction processing to graphical user interfaces. \"UI members recognised that it was essential-to build func- tionality on top of Unix if open systems were tokknock out pro- prietary systems,\" explains Peter Cunningham, president and chief executive of UL By definiig \"reference tech- nologies\" and developing inter- faces to link them, UI will spec- ify how computer products can be incorporated into an open systems environment. UI is also attempting to resolve disputes over \"stan- dards\" that have split the industry in recent years. The unification of approaches is essential if open systems are to \"take out\" proprietary systems, Cunningham says. UI members also see poten tially powerful competition for Unix in the form of Microsoft's \"Windows NT\" operating sys tem, which should be available next year, and the software that IBM and Apple Computer have agreed to develop jointly. UI is also challenged by the efforts of established propri etary systems manufacturers. Last week IBM announced that it plans to offer Unix on its latest mainframes. IBM is expected to focus on creating links between its own propri etary systems and those of other manufacturers. In a shift of emphasis, UI has acknowl edged that existing proprietary system software must be inte grated with open systems. The UI Atlas framework \"ref- erence technologies\" will become available over the next three years. It will be some time, however, before all the pieces of Atlas are mapped out. Louise Kehoec",

   "text_content" : "t'OU4 0, WJDG3 of the bra.in Wodayr i at about the jam. agif as our biwieg 'of blood eduplatlo was lUK went round 'the body and rur to the hert.\" SvidGrabae-Sith, pro- at' Oxford University, points out that all the drugs used today to treat mentul disor- ders, whether mild anxiety or psevere psychosis, are based on the empirical discoLvery that they relieve symtom s, rather thanany rational understand- ing of the brain. Most work poorly and unpredictably and or many conditlons, including Alzhelmer's disease, the men- tal scourge of old age, there is no treatment at all. Oxford's SmithKline Bee- cham Centre for Applied Neuropsychobiology - opened officially today - is part of a worldwide effort to understand the working of the brain at a molecular level. That know- ledge should eventually enable the pharmaceutical industry to design selective and effective drugs for mental illness. Grahame-Smith, director of the centre, outlines the pros- pects with real excitement. Just in the last few weeks, he says, he has come to believe that scientists will learn in the near future to manipulate the processes leading to senile dementia. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuti- cal group, established the cen- tre in 1989 with the promise of Â£5m funding over 10 years. The abandoned kitchens of the Rad- cliffe Infirmary, Oxford's oldest teaching hospital, were con- verted into laboratories, and the research programme is now fully under way, with a core staff of 12 scientists - six employed by SB and six by the university. There are also half a dozen visiting researchers. Although the Oxford-SB cen- tre is only one of hundreds of neurobiology laboratories worldwide, its activities illus- trate the art of brain research today. Here are six examples: * Developing neural cell cul- tures for use as a model system to study the effect of drugs on the brain. Actual neurones (nerve cells) will not last for more than about a month in cultures outside the brain. Many studies require longer- term cultures, so the SB centre is using cells derived originally from neuroblastoma, a type of brain cancer, which survive indefinitely in incubators. 0 Studying the action of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Chemical messengers such as serotoiin (also known as Mhydroxytryptatnkp or 'liT tiuo between brain cells. 'They work by stimulating protein molecules (receptors) on the trget cel. The SB centre is octaising on the serotonis eceptor proteins, known to be involved In depression, anxiety and mental illness. Some psy- chniatric drugs act directly on these receptors but the benefit to the patient develops only slowly, over several weeks. Neural cell cultures are used at Oxford. to study the gradual biochemical changes involved. * Investigating the electrical activity of neurones. Brain ells communicate by electrical aignals as well as chemical messengers. The Oxford scieni- tists use tiny glass microelec- trodes inside the cell to record changes in electric current across a cell membrane, in response to a specific drug. Thnese changes result from the drug's effect on receptors cou- pled to \"channels\" which allow elected ions such as potas- sium or calcium to pass through the cell's outer mem- brane. * Fluorescent imaging of ionic changes in brain cell;. The concentration of ions inside the cell chanaes within a second when neurtines are activated by neuioftransit ters. The SB centre is usin. calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes to monitor these-Chnghe Cultured cells are loaded wit dye and then stimulated b) serotonln; the increase ri fluo rescence is measued by corn puterised image analysis; * Measuring potassium level in the brain. The processel that regulate ionic concentrq tions break down when some one has a stroke - a blood clol in the brain - because the oxygen supply is reduced. The resulting rise in potassium lev els is a primary cause of the irreversible brain damage sus fered by stroke victims. The SE centre is using micro-eleo trodes to investigate the lini between potassium and neuro nal damage. It may then bi possible to develop drugi which interfere with this pro cess and protect cells againsi oxygen starvation immediatel) after a stroke. * Using gene activation tc investigate neurotransmittern and psychotropic drugs. Wher nerve cells are activated b5 drugs, a series of genes it switched on. These \"immedi ate-early genes\" lead to the production of proteins whose function is not yet understood T , he Danes have a higher per capita export of pharmaceuticals than any country except Switzerland and they claim that there is a greater concentration of bioscientists within 30km of Copenhagen than anywhere ele except Boston or Basle. Only one Danish pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, is listed on the Copenhagen stock exchange. The others live a relatively anonymous existence, but their work is often distinguished. Among them is H. Lundbeck, which is owned by a private foundation. Lundbeck has specialised since the 1950s in drugs for the treatment of serious psychiatric disturbances, depression, schizophrenia and psychosis. Several of its preparations are mar ket leaders in Europe. The company recently announced a break- through in the treatment of schizophrenia wit Sertindole, which is said to eliminate most of the sideeffects associated with current drugs. With a turnover of about DKr607m (54m) i 1990, Lundbeck does not aspire to bring this drug to the market on its own, said Erik Sprunk-Jansen, managing director. It has signed agreements with Abbott, of the US, and Shionogi, of Japan, for clinical testing and mar- keting of the drugs in overseas markets. Sertindole was discovered through computer molecular modelling. The drug is not a variant of earlier preparations, says Lundbeck, but an entirely new chemical. The main problem with existing drugs is that they cause uncontrollable movements in the patient, especially tongue and mouth move- ments which are so socially distressing that patients often drop the treatment. Sertindole is without this side-effect and will therefore enable schizophrenics to function more success- fully in a normal environment, says Lundbeck. He expects the drug to be an important mon- ey-spinner for the company, but it will proba- bly not receive regulatory approval and become commercially available before 1995 or 1996. Hilary Barnes Examining the *eodrical activity of cultured brain cells The Oxford sdentists are using one particular gene, called c-fos, to identify precisely which cells in the brains of lab- oratory animals are activated by specific drugs. Although academic suspi- cions about industrial sponsor- ship of university research have largely disappeared over the last decade, many biomedi- cal scientists still believe pri- vately that funding by a research council or medical charity - if you can get it - is preferable to accepting money from a drug company. Grahame-Smith, however, insists that his scientists bene- fit from the SB arrangement without losing academic free- dom. \"Our research into the biological processes that underlie brain function is .not driven by SmithKline Beecham product development,\" be says. But scientists at the Oxford centre make use of SB's exten- sive in-house research facili- ties, for instance to obtain experimental chemicals that are not available commercially. From SB's point of view, one reason for setting up a direct link with Oxford University is to help recruit well-trained and committed scientists to its own R&D laboratories. And the company benefits from privi- leged access to the centre's research, which may give leads to developing new drugs even though it is not driven directly by product development. SB and the university have a legal agreement which requires scientists at the Oxford centre to give the company six weeks to review any research results before submitting them for publication. This is a normal feature of academic-industrial collaboration, to give the com- pany time to patent any discov- ery that might be commer- cially valuable. \"The possibility of practical developments has added a little sparkle to our activities,\" says Grahame-Smith. \"My experi- ence is that many basic scien- tists like to feel that there's going to be a practical outcome to their work.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Della Iradshaw here is still a long way to go before the androids of \"Star Wars\" Walk the streets of Los Angeles, Paris or London. But in Japan a far more down-to-earth approach to robotics has nevertheless pro- nuced machines which carry out tasks in anuncannily human way. On show at the Science Museum, in London, as part of the UK's Japan Festival, 24 robots, many of them experi- mental, stalked, moved objects and played the electronic :organ with a precision and flexibility that mere mortals would find difficult to match. With the eerie likeness of human arms, two Fanuc robots worked together to produce small metal boxes. The first. robot twisted and turned to assemble the sides of the box on the table, using suction pads to hold the metal plates in place. The second machine welded the box together using a laser. Similarly mortal in appearance was Kobe Steel's robot for painting cars. The paint head weaved nrr..nd thA car and under the bonnet iike a trained paint sprayer looking for the last spot of metalwork that had been missed. This robot, according to the manu- facturer, is already being used in several Japanese paint shops. To replace humans in haz- ardous environments Mitsubi- shi Heavy Industries has devel- oped a yellow and black robot with a head, eyes, torso and arms. Remotely controlled, the robot duplicates the actions of the operator's hands and arms. At a safe distance from the nuclear power station or other dangerous area, ihe operator can even \"feel\" the robot fin- gers as they are guided to move objects or manipulate tools. A walking robot, from Hitachi, could provide the \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t missing motion system, with four legs, which step across the ground like a horse, putting one foot forward at a time, knees bending. The machine can walk up and down stairs, step over obstacles in its path or duck to avoid hanging obstacles, all at speeds of up to 2.5km an hour. Several industrial robots, more used to the drudge of the production line, have been given time off at the show for more entertaining activities. Three Toshiba robots, in pastel shades of pink, blue and green, were spinning tops, one on top of the other, and playing the organ. Meanwhile, a multi-purpose robot from Komatsu, dressed in a red, black and white cos- tume and mask, played out the intricate movements of the tra- ditional Japa- nese Shishi mai dance. Freed from the day-to-day rou tine of welding or cutting steel, the machine also drew pictures by holding a brush in its \"mouth\". Other uses or the robots were more friv- olous. Yasak- awa Electric has developed a pair of robo tic arms which can arrange flowers, while one of Matsushita's robots took to portrait drawing. A camera attached to a com- puter records data on a per- son's face, analysing the thick- ness and direction of the lines. The robot then uses this data to draw the portrait of the per- son. And a golf putting robot, from Toyoda Machine Works, would seem to have few other apparent uses. Aided by a sec- ond robot which feeds informa- tion on the position of the golf hole to it via a computer, the putting robot lines up the club, takes several practice swings - just like its human counter- part - and then gives the ball a swipe. Unlike the human golfer, however, the robot arm is not able to select its own club.",

   "text_content" : "ORAND THEATRE, LEDS f1owf--r U m1* * f a _teal T enwla Opera North, the liveliest opera company in the land, open their autumn season with the first British professional production of Chabrier's 1877 comic opera L'Etoile. It proves an absolute winner: a show of unalloyed delight that for two-and-a-half hours keeps the audience floating on a cloud of pure happiness and hilarity. For those who believe that French comic opera is inherently resistent to either translation or cross-border translocation, a trip to Leeds will prove both instructive and wildly enjoyable. This work has always had its passionate devo- tees, yet it was not until the early 1960s - when the Opera de Lyon under John Eliot Gardiner mounted their celebrated production - that its caviar-to-the-general status began to be chal- lenged. Received opinion used to proclaim that L'E- toile was a case of wonderful music - ,every chord, every phrase, every instrumental colour- application infused with Chabrier's life-giving warmth - ill-matched to a weakly whimsical libretto. The Lyons production brought fresh light to bear on the subject by demonstrating how much daffy Marx-Brothers-style fared could be had from the ribald inconsequentialities of the libretto. In Leeds, and in entirely different fashion, the fun goes a stage further. It is the great and special achievement of the producer, Phyllida and designer, Anthony rWard, to have deviled a show that is at once rootedly English in a t and free from all localised sweetenings and enngs. The fantasy world of King Out the First, the court astrologer Siroco, the pedlar Lazuli and the princess Laoula becomes here an anianted pop-up picture-book in bold, elegant patterns (black-and-white chessboard floors, Matisse-blue front-cloths dotted with gold stars, cut-out clouds, courtiers in powdered white-face and 9oll costume). The style is maintained with absolute strict- ness, with no quarter given to easy laughelicit- Ing, and with tight organisation of lines and formations: the direction of the splendid Opera North chorus is a model of art-concealing art- istry. This is, indeed, a production of dazzling but never sucat pertise, and in the best way the farce al to develop its own gravity-defy logic. The production tem have an invincible ally in Jeremy Sams, whose translation (in common with his ENO Magic Flute and Molibre Mier at the National) boasts a modern-accented nimble. ness of rhyme and deftness with a droll dou- ble-entendre that has the audience hugging itself with pleasure. And the young British cast play with their roles as though born farceurs. No one on stage is more completely attuned to the style than Kate Flowers as the lady-in-waiting Alobs, mi-. trees of the salaciously raised eyebrow; but the wit and virtuosity of Alan Oke as barmy dinip mat, Mark Curtis as private secretary, and John Hall's Siroco as a cross between Rasputin and Richard Briers are wonderful to behold. Anthony Mee as Out though he needs to pace the dialogue with still sharper control, makes a ripe comic virtue out of his meaty Italianate tenor; Mary Hegarty is an enchantingly pretty, sweet-voiced Laoula; and Pamela Helen Step- hen, tomboyishly Scots in rakish cap and knee- length shorts, wins every heart in the mezzo- trousers-role of Lazuli. It is Chabrier's music, Provencal in harmonic tang and rhythmic zest, Parisian in economy and smartness of cut, that gives the whole show its \"heart\". The young Tours-based French con ductor Jean-Yves Ossonce - this is his British debut - makes sure that musical values are never slighted even in the moments of zanies merriment. The pacing is taut, the colours emerging from the pit are as bright as any on stage, and yet the moments of melodic tender ness are allowed full value, lovingly shaped and hrased. Enough of high-keyed superlatives: this i\" another Opera North triumph. Max Loppert",

The new songs promise well. Both the title track and the current single \"Calling Elvis\" are beautifully crafted songs, and there are another half dozen equally fine. They suggested that Mark Knopfler has spent his years away from the band usefully, producing albums for other singers and having a fling with his old mates in the Notting Hillbil- lies, and all while stirring new ingredients into his song-mak- ing mixture. There are flavours of Randy Newman and JJ Cale, even a hint of Lou Reed and a slimmed down, purposeful sound. Nothing is portentous or indulgent in the dozen tracks on the album, while the addition of a pedal steel guitar to several songs gives Knop- fler's own distinctive guitar playing an excellent foil. Five minutes into the Wem- bley show most of that promise had evaporated. Dire Straits opened with \"Calling Elvis\", solid, bass-heavy, yet decently lively until it was time for everyone to introduce them- selves: Knopfler's solo unac- countably quoted from \"On Broadway\", the two keyboard players took off on a little diversion all their own and the two drummers exchanged cringe-making riffs; suddenly a perfectly proportioned song had become a ten-minute indulgence. The running order mixed the new numbers with the tried and tested, nearly all of them 50 per cent too long. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is a beautiful song, one of Knopfler's finest, shows just what he learnt from Dylan's lovesongs and how he was able to personalise it. It simply doesn't need the over- production, complete with graceless saxophone solo, it got here. Even the indestructible \"Sultans of Swing\" seemed slower than one remembered it, weighed by the thick lay- ered sound. That it was all so faultlessly fronted only compounded the disappointment. But as one number after another was prodded and inflated into a massive sound object, the lights and the smoke machines went into overdrive and waves of bass were allowed to echo around the arena, it seemed like nothing so much as a Pink Floyd concert with some decent tunes. Knopfler deserves and owes himself far better than that. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "' 4Y1New 5 or. d ean that you will soon be on a pa with vaudeville if you do not haid over the reuisite greenbacks? I am too young to reminmber the death of vaudeville, but I saw it re-ebacted in two films this week. In Life S&eM Mel Brooks staggers througha plot so old it probably remembers the birth of vaudeville. And in Stepping Out tap teacher Lin Minnf gets her evenlng-class chorines together, including a visibly stressed Julie Walters, for an all-trite-on-the-night charity concert. I have no idea which of these follies to review first, so I shall toss for it. Heads: so Mel Brooks gets It One of the few memorable thing about Life Stinks is Brooks's head. This Roman orb wired for sound bobs along above the plot about a millionaire property tycoon (Brooks) who wagers that he can survive 90 days in L.A.'s worst slumland sans cash or credit cards. The Brooks head, bobbing on, meets and falls in love with pretty bag-lady Lesley Ann Warren; plans revenge against his cheating co-wagerer: and graces the half-dozen gags that work and the several dozen that do not. In the first first five minutes you think everything will work. The champagne merriment includes a funny floorcleaning joke, an uproarious phallic Jtad al grade-A inner-city devel- Opent wl mean tearing Aeojl; people's home. ST\" he i ir rts. And ejecting lthcri e4b4en and dying. But when we move to Skid Row, sentimentality oire . t, and the film starts to biuk tn adagio style, like a street performer who has heard of a death in the family. Brooks is a trouper and the movie itself never slackens; in its farewelilminutes it conjures a vintage routine between the hero and a vainglorious fellow- tramp. But more comedy and less heartache throughout would have been welcome. \"I auditioned for Bob Fosse once,\" says someone in Step- ping Out. \"I didn't get the job, but I got to touch his sleeve.\" This is a film we do not know whether to laugh orcry at. Are director Lewis Gilbert (Educa- ting Rita, Shirley Valentine) and screenwriter Richard Har- ris, adapting his own stage play, wearing straight faces as they guides Minnelli's class of amateur tapsters towards the six-hankie finale in which we watch them slay e tout Buffalo in a Save The Children charity show? We fear they are. Only Mel Brooks would have the cruel wit to plonk a wide-bodied Shelley Winters'at the piano - playing a Miss Grunp of the ivories - and demand the gig- gles the sight provokes. Or to licence the titters deserved by a plot that riffles through every character clich6 in musi- cal comedy history. There is the shy young bachelor romancing the mousy girl in specs; the nurse who taps for her hospital patients; the snooty housewife who learns to bend the Terpsichorean knee (Julie Walters resembling a drag-act Anna Neagle); and the hard-hitting pro (Minnelli) LIFE STINKS (12) Odem Haymarket STEPPING OUT (PG) Empire TRUST (15) Metro, C min Chbds, Everyoau FX2 (15) CaeOM West Eed TEEN AGENT (PG) Camse West End GET BACK (PG) CaMeu Patons St 'ho just knows her girls are gonna make t. Gilbert directs this farrago with alln clseups blazing. And La Minnelli,planting a dozen lOOfwatt bulbs inside her pixie face, goes at it with a showbiz elan that makes Cabaret look like Waiting For Godot. If these two had been in at the death of vaudeville, it would never have died. Hal Hartley's Trust is a young man's film. It would not know what vaudeville was if you smote it across the face with a kipper crying \"I say, I say, I say.\" But oddly, its comedy is rather vaudevillian. It does turns. From the moment that Dad keels over from shock on the kitchen floor and never gets up again - his pretty daughter (Adrienne Shelly) is serious about a jobless lout sacked from a computer sac tory - we laugh at the spotlit oddities and non-sequiturs. These include a mother who gets the paid lout drunk and inserts him in the bed of her older daughter to shock Ms Shelly out of love. A dishev- elled, unwashed proletarian father (the lout's) who bangs on about keeping the bathroom clean. Some funny business with a hand grenade. And a shooting style wondrous in its ability to turn suburban furni- ture and people into abstract- art installations. The first are ai gleaming angles and lung- ing diagonals, the second are shock-eyed icons soaking up the blue-rinse light of a late- summer small town. As in Har- tley's last (and first) filni The Ultimate Truth, the director shows that only a few subtle switches need be thrown for the everyday to be apocalypsed into the comically extraordi- nary. Nigel Andrews Like its predecessor, FX2 is an engaging, well-made thriller that foregoes macho heroics for good, old-fashioned ingenu- ity. In it, Bryan Brown reprises his role as an ace special-ef- sects man who helps the New York police solve a tough case. Things go horribly wrong, and Brown is forced once again to team up with the marvellous Brian Dennehy to set them right. Although the subplot involv- ing stolen Vatican treasures is a bit strained, writer Bill Con- don and director Richard Franklin have concocted a film whnich captures your attention without taking itself too seri- ously. Brown's character is a refreshing sort of hero, a New Man hero who refuses to use guns, choosing instead to use robot clowns, diapers and sau- sage-links as his weapons. It is nice to see a thriller which val- ues intelligence over violence. A film which seems to place no value at all on intelligence is Teen Agent, a misguided attempt to make a James Bond-style film about 17-year olds. It tells the story of an American high-school student (Richard Grteco), who is mis- taken for a spy while visiting France. What follows is a series of stale action sequences, implausible plot lines and jokes which misfire more often than bad guys' Uzis. There is nothing wrong with movies about tongue-tied American teens - it Is when a film is made for them that you have to be wary. A rock-and-roll movie sure to be of interest to more than just teens is Get Back, a record of Paul McCartney's marathon 1989-90 concert tour. Despite the rousing ballads and stir- ring crowd shots, this remains a strangely downbeat film. It is not that McCartney doesn't remain a fine singer. Rather, it is Richard Lester's clumsy, hectoring direction which often spoils the film. Not con- tent simply to give us McCart- ney in performance, Lester illustrates several of the songs with a variety of off-putting images. Thus, \"The Long and Winding Road\" is interrupted by clips of moon-landings and Vietnam horrors, while \"Live and Let Die\" is dotted with images of Arab-Israeli violence. And, in the film's most bewil- dering moment, Martin Luther King's face appears during \"Fool on the Hill\". It is hard to believe this sort of turgid image-mongering is brought to us by the same director who made A Hard Day's Night. Equally depressing are the constant references to the Bea- tles. McCartney is clearly within his rights to play Bea- ties tunes 20 years after the group broke up, though why he'd want film clips of them in their prime imposed over his current solo work is mystify- ing. It provides a distinctly melancholy air to the whole proceeding - not the sort of buzz you want to get from a concert film.

   "text_content" : "iLYMC STUDIu, IAMMISM ITNr Here is a thoroughly entertaniang American double bill which plays around with hell and comes out rather well. Under the joint title, Oh HWI the frst is a one man show written by Shel Silverstein and performed by Steve Frost about a gambler and blues singer who loses his soul to the devil and periodically wins it back again. The DeVil and Bily Mar*ham is a spoken ballad, versatile both in its writing and in Frost's playing. As a piece on Its owr, it sn:ot rmuch m ore than a Jae d'sprit which leads nowhere. As part of the double bill, however, it leads very neatly into the more intriguing BoMy Gourm in HkU by David Mamet. This is a light piece, too. Mamet's is a liberal hen, manned by trades union officials and bureaucrats who keep their eye on the clock and would prefer to be going fishin or reading Freak magazine to dealing with the new arrivals. Still, they do their job up toa point. Bobby Gould, when he enters the wasiting room in dressing gown, pyjamas and slippers, declares himself a good man or at least a \"straight B minus sort of man\". All he has done is to threaten to stick a toaster up his girl friend. When the girl friend arrives as well, we learn that she is not perfect either. She bores the devil's interrogator to distraction. There is a show of male unity that the girl must go, and indeed in the end everyone is released, though not without twists along the way. This is a witty, zany play, full of theatrical tricks down to the use of fireworks and corny jokes. It falls into no obvious pattern, but provides a great deal of fun and some thought. Is Bob Gould a good man or not? Steven O'Shea in his waders and fishing gear is a splendid interrogator and Martin Sadofski as his assistant catches to perfection the well-enough intentioned, but sub-intelligent bureaucrat. It was clever of the Mandrake Theatre Company to bring the double bill to London for the European premiere. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "THE DUTCH non-paper on economic and monetary union within the European Commu- nity - though almost immedi- ately disowned by its pre- senter, Mr Wim Kok, Holland's finance minister - did more in a few days than months of pre- vious waffle to clarify the path to Emu. With Dr Hans Tiet- meyer of the Bundesbank rein- forcing the main points in his presentation to the Bundestag yesterday, negotiations have now begun in earnest. Too many view Emu in nar- rowly political terms. Some, for example, believe it is the way to bind the newly united Ger- many into the EC. Others insist that Emu should not sep- arate member states from one another. But nothing could more surely divide Germans from their neighbours than a monetary constitution inferior to the one they now enjoy. As dangerous for the EC's politi- cal legitimacy in other coun- tries would be association of Emu with years of slow growth and high unemployment. As has been true throughout the development of the EC, politi- cal integration will only follow from economic integration. That this means an indepen- dent central bank committed to price stability is now accepted, even if important dif- ferences remain over the role of finance ministers, particu- larly on exchange rate policy. Yet the Germans have not yet won one of their main flanking requirements: EC control over national fiscal policy. Mean- while, almost everything to do with the transition remains to be decided, with disagreement focused on two related choices: whether to set deadlines or insist on prior convergence; and whether to move in one convoy to Emu, or at two (or more) speeds. Plausible case A plausible case can be made for no more than deadlines. The present ERM may become unstable because it lacks exchange controls. It can also be argued that convergence of inflation will be secured by currency unification and need not be a precondition for it. Neither argument is convinc- ing. The former is speculative. The latter merely suggests that inflation will converge within a given monetary area; but it need not converge at a low level. Even under a supposedly independent central bank, a monetary policy dedicated to low inflation could be endan- gered by initial maladjust- ments and divergent inflation- ary trends. Can one be confident that members of the board of the European central bank would support a Ger- manic monetary policy, regard- less of what was happening in their own countries? Sustainable position The sustainability of each country's fiscal position is also important. One can decree that governments will not be bailed out by the central bank. But it will be difficult to make that rule credible, at least until the first few crises have'been suc- cessfully navigated. In the meantime, the perceived infla- tion risk will raise real interest rates. Furthermore, the less credible the \"no bail out\" rule, the larger the debt a profligate government can accumulate and the more difficult it will be to stick to the rule. Emu is to be marriage with- out divorce. Convergent infla- tion and sustainable fiscal posi- tions would, therefore, not merely be desirable, but would also demonstrate a serious intent. Why should the Ger- mans or the Dutch accept a new currency some of whose prospective managers have never shown a monetary com- mitment comparable to their own? At the same time, large gaps in incomes per head are no bar to the use of a single currency, provided that it is not an excuse for premature wage equalisation. Thus, Emu need not be an obstacle to EC enlargement, though a two- speed move to Emu might cre- ate a more welcoming environ- ment for new members. If Emu is to occur within the next several years, as some desire, it cannot include all current members of the EC, as the same people tend to want. Whether one calls the result a two-speed move or one-speed with derogations is a distinc- tion with little difference. Low inflation and sustain- able fiscal positions must be the tests. If member countries are upset by the thought of being left out, they have six years to meet the conditions. Like hanging, the prospect should concentrate the mind. This is the second of a series on the future of the European Community.",

   "text_content" : "IT IS appropriate that the relationship between Britain and Japan, so shaped over the last decade by industry and finance, should be marked by a cultural celebration. For all that they could have in com- mon as island mercantile nations with a post-war fond- ness for long serving conserva- tive governments, the two have mostly been divided by history and geography. If the Japan Festival helps bridge some gaps in comprehension, so much the better. This is not the first time that Jan has displayed its great cultural traditions overseas, though it may be the most extensive package yet assem- bled. For Japan, not normally prone to expose itself so fully to the foreigner, and having learned the pitfalls of imperial- ism of a different kind, it is particularly intriguing that it should have chosen Britain. The US, where Japanese fences are in need of some repair, might have have been consid- ered a more natural target At the time of the MeUi reg- toration in the 1f80s, Britain was the country that Japan most sought to learn from as it emerged from centuries of iso- lation. Since the Second World War, the US, first as occupying power and still protaector, was dominant, with BritMan increa- ingly being studied more as an industrial and cultural museum. To the extent that there were worthy European models, they were West Ger- many, also rebuildg, Swiur land, and, to a degree, Sweden. EC pnleCde That Japan has chosen to invest in Brital, with about 30 per cent of an its European manuacturing ventures now here, may be elained by the Protection and by Mrs 7Isap med to -t s t-e Japoa couMd brig a lot to dut&il. Bat this M ia of mwMbaleseso sd (tabR iaetb d laboratlon with Bornda, am d kM waU prae. esu ges I a i anri U& dsee ft Pale with those Japanese car com- panies already present in Britain. Two weeks ago, there was vigorous debate in the Trades Union Congress over whether these same practices - in reality Japanised versions of American ideas - were \"alien.\" Regrettably, a motion to this effect passed. Importing ideas It is probably more difficult, psychologically, for the British to learn from the Japanese than vice versa. Japan seems to have mastered the knack of importing ideas without feeling threatened, whereas Britain, though not Britain alone, fears some emasculation - hence the reputation of Japan as a threat, not a partner, in US and French political and indus- trial circles. Thus we can admire Japan for its success, but somehow feel the lessons are inapplica- ble in the whole.

   "article_dc_title" : "Banks' Bill of Rights",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Sor all their cla-1ims to be modern retailers of F financial services, Britain's banks some- times seem to have a great resistance to the notion that the customer may occasionally be right, So the enforcephent of a banking code of practice, scheduled for -the turn of the year, represents a revolution. The code is intended to guar- antee minimum standards of service and to protect custom- ers' rights. It is a voluntary set of rules, drawn up during two years of tortuous negotiations by the banks' and building societies' trade associations - the British Bankers Associa- tion and the Building Societies' Association. In traditional banking theol- ogy, the branch manager is infallible. It was, therefore, a naive hope that banks would find it easy to formulate a bill of rights for their customers. A first version, published a year ago, did little more than codify existing bank practices. It was savaged by consumer groups, who complained that it legitimised banks' high-handed approach to charging their cus- tomers, to settling disputes with them and to marketing new products. Even the Bank of England was disappointed. The government insisted that the banks rethink it, on pain of seeing their voluntary code ousted by legislation. The banks could scarcely have imagined a more terrible threat. So, after another year of bickering between them- selves, they have come up with a revised version. In one respect they have undoubtedly learned their les- son. They are sounding out the Bank of England, the Treasury, the Banking Ombudsman and consumer groups in private, before publishing the new code, in the hope of avoiding the shame of having to with- draw it a second time. When their views have been gath- ered, a committee headed by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, will decide whether to give it the final blessing. Though the banks are keen to keep it under wraps, the Financial Times has obtained a copy. The most obvious reform is that it is written in simpler language. The 23 clauses of the original have been condensed to 20 and they will be compre- hensible to most consumers. Only a handful of the origi- nal clauses have escaped revi- sion, though many of the changes are superficial. How- ever, the banks have conceded most of the consumer groups' demands - with one impor- tant exception, charges. Most complaints about the first version were that it did little to prevent the banks from abusing their power in three main areas: * the commercial exploitation of financial information given by customers in confidence; * disputes with customers over the alleged misuse of a plastic card; * the levying of bank charges. Banks would never dream of disclosing financial informa- tion on their customers to a competitor. But they are not quite so scrupulous about withholding details of clients' financial affairs and names and addresses from their own subsidiary companies. The reason is that they have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in businesses selling non-banking products and ser- P *Thant In0o will anmd card \"u*M IdNea fth custo\"We That banks and -s U \" will / hlp custanwm to und how thr* accunts .pwa t TO maint;n c ;ftnm in the banking and credit card payment A**/ vices, such as insurance, pen- sions or stock market invest- ments. Naturally, they are keen to sell these products to their branch customers, a pro- cess known as cross-selling. But many customers are just as concerned about their account details being passed to a company within the bank's own group as to an outside business. Reluctantly, banks have conceded that they will not pass on such information \"to other companies in the same group, in the absence of express consent\". There are two other changes to marketing practices which will be welcome to many con- sumers, tired with the junk mail they receive. Banks will give new customers the oppor- tunity, at the time they open their accounts, to give instruc- tions that they do not wish to receive marketing material through the post. Banks will also remind customers from time to time, and at least once every five years, of their right to stop banks from sending the marketing material. Other reforms are in the sec- tion dealing with plastic cards, which covers credit cards, cash machine cards, debit cards and store cards. It was drafted reluctantly by banks, which are concerned that issuers of store cards will not conform to it. A couple of banks are mut- tering the heresy that in this area they might like to see leg- islation, to force the store groups to adhere to the rules. They are particularly con- cerned that issuers of store cards are bound by far less stringent rules on the confiden- tiality of customer details. Banks have agreed to bear all losses in cases where a card has been misused but has not been received by the customer. To avoid these losses, the card issuer will also have to demon- strate that an allegedly mis- used card has been received by a customer. This transference of the bur- den of proving the case from customer to card issuer is per- haps the most important reform in the new version of the code, since few consumers can afford to take on the banks in a long legal dispute. (At the moment, a card holder has to prove that he is not guilty of fraud to avoid losses on a dis- puted transaction.) It applies to those occasions when a cus- tomer complains that funds have been withdrawn from an account, but cannot recollect using the plastic card. According to the first draft, customers would have been lia- ble for all losses unless they could prove they had not \"acted fraudulently or negli- gently\". In the new version, the card issuer carries the losses unless it can provide proof of fraud or \"gross negli- gence\", rather than just \"negli- gence\". Indeed, some banks are alarmed that this shifting of the burdae of proof goes far too far. They fear that users of cash machines will exploit the change to challenge legitimate debits from their accounts, One bank is considering put- ting a hidden 'camera behind its electronic cash machines. Consumer groups, such as the National Consumer Coun- cil and the Consumers' Associ- ation, are still likely to express one serious reservation about the plastic card clauses. They will complain that customers should be able to insist on being able to receive a single function card, such as a cheque guarantee card, rather than the multi-function cards, combining the characteristics of guarantee cards, debit cards and cash machine cards, which banks have been issuing in the past few years. Consumer groups are acting as defenders of those who see debit and cash cards as the devil's cur- rency, a sore temptation to over-spending. But the consumer lobby's main criticism will be reserved for the issue of charges. Banks are rarely more irksome to cus- tomers than when they debit charges from an account with- out explaining why. The com- mon complaint is that no other retailer is permitted to lift money from a consumer's pocket without explanation. Consumer groups have suggested that banks should notify customers in advance of deducting the charges, so that the customers can satisfy themselves that the charges are appropriate. However the banks have refused to make this change. They claim it would cost them Â£100m to make the necessary changes to their computer systems and another Â£50m every year in overheads. There is a concession on charges. They are abandoning the unpopular practice of levy- ing charges on charges. Cus- tomers have frequently found themselves paying charges for two successive billing periods, because the charges they were forced to pay in the first period have put them into the red briefly for the second period. The new code resorts on this occasion to the obscurantism of Groucho Marx's \"party of the first part\" skit. It says that \"banks will now disregard the charges to be applied to cus- tomers' accounts, for any charging period if those charges were incurred solely as a result of the application of charges for the previous charg- ing period\". The banks and building soci- eties face a nervous few weeks. The BBA and the BSA are holding meetings with govern- ment officials and lobby groups to persuade them to back the code and this is proving a slower process than the banks hoped. They planned to pub- lish the code in October, with a view to implementing it early in the new year. But fixing meetings with the consumer groups has not been easy, so publication will now not be until November at the earliest. None the less the response of most consumer groups so far has not been hostile. They recognise that banks have made concessions and they take comfort from a promise by the banks that the code will be reviewed every three years. If pushed, the banks will even acknowledge that their first draft was a serious mis- take - quite an admission for the infallible bank manager.",

A dissident in the bad old days of Soviet rule, he is now fighting to defend his presidency - from attacks he has brought upon himself. Even before he was elected chairman of the Georgian parliament last year, his critics suspected him of authoritarian tendencies. But then he and all his rivals were busy calling each other liars and traitors. When Observer joined him for a drive in his black Volga limousine last year, Gamsakhurdia was asked about critics' claims that he would prove a dictator. He widened his eyes and said in a hurt tone: \"Me? I'm too soft to be a dictator.\" But since then there are clear signs that he may be prone to dictatorial behaviour. His most visible achievement, since he came to power on a wave of promises to lead Georgia to independence, has been to file two black limousines.

   "text_content" : "ull marks to the Royal Institute of Interna- tional Affairs for produ- cing what many people must be wanting this week: a short, readable book setting the Yugolav crisis in its historical and regional context. The author covered eastern Europe for The Economist for 21 years, ending last year, and now edits the RIA's monthly, The World Today. Like many such specialists he halls from the area he writes about, though he has lived in Britain since 1954. He describes him- self in the introduction as \"a Croat from Yugoslavia\". Time was when the first half of that label might have struck us as a baroque detail. Now the second half is almost a political concession. Serbs and Serbo- philes will scan the book for signs of bias, and will no doubt find them. Mr Cviic sees the determination of the Serbs to reassert their dominance in Yugoslavia after Tito's death as the primary factor leading to the collapse of the federa- tion. He summarises Serb grievances about the previous state of affairs and shows how they were exploited by Mr Slobodan Milosevic in his rise to power; but it is clear that he has more sympathy for the fears and complaints of the non-Serbs. He refers to \"the Croatian Serbs' vehement rejection of a more independent status for Croatia within a Yugoslav con- federation, let alone full inde- pendence\" and attributes it, no doubt accurately, both to fears of \"what could befall the Serbs under another Croat regime\" (given the appalling record of the wartime fascist Croat state) and to \"the not unjustified expectation of loss of privi- leges, subsidies and other bene- fits that the communist regime gave Croat Serbs\". But he does not find space to consider whether the new regime in Croatia did all that it could have done to allay these fears, or whether it was wise to ignore this Achilles heel when pushing ahead with its nation- alist programme. He even alludes at one point to \"the very real conflict of political and economic inter- ests between the more plural- ist, western-oriented and pro- market Croatia and Slovenia on one side and the authoritar- ian, anti-western and anti-mar- ket Serbia on the other\". Would it not be fairer to say that Serbia's communists, led by Mr Milosevic, were more successful than Croatia's in pre-empting the nationalist card and thus have so far held on to power; but that both republics have elected nation- alist governments which, what- ever their rhetoric, show less than total respect for either political or economic pluralism in practice? (Slovenia is more genuinely pluralist, though that is due as much to its presi- dent, a former communist, as to its nationalist government.) Those are valid points, but the book would not necessarily REMAKING THE BALKANS By Christopher Cviic Pnlter PublishersI/RA 113 pages, Â£22.50/1Â£8.95 be more dispassionate if writ- ten by a pure-blooded English- man, nor more valuable if Mr Cviic had completely sup- pressed his personal feelings. It is certainly very informative, especially about the complex interacting national grievances caused by the events of the sec- ond world war, and the way these affected the behaviour and popularity of the different communist parties. I had not realised before, for instance, to what an extent Tito had turned Albania into a Yugoslav satel- lite before 1948. Much of the \"Stalinism\" which character- ised subsequent Albanian poli- cies under Enver Hoxha was evidently rooted in a determi- nation to avoid ever again fall- ing under Yugoslav domina- tion. \"Remaking the Balkans\" is clearly not going to be easy. Their political and economic prospects, Mr Cviic suggests (writing in July), \"though per- haps not as bleak as those sac- ing the Soviet Union, are cer- tainly bleaker than those for ex-communist central Europe\". On the whole he thinks it a good thing that they are no longer controlled by external spheres of influence, but he warns the west against opting for a policy of benign neglect. The region, he thinks, will gradually sort itself into two main groupings: a western, Roman Catholic, ex-Habsburg one linking Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia to their northern neighbours, and an orthodox Balkan one comprising Bul- garia, Greece, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia \"with Macedonia in the middle as an independent state or perhaps, ultimately, a part of Bulgaria\". This sounds like wishful think- ing, especially when he adds that the latter grouping \"could perhaps provide a framework for a gradual solution - or at least for a defusing - of the explosive Kosovo issue that divides Serbia and Albania\". It is very hard to see Serbia accepting this, or indeed allow- ing Bosnia and Croatia to carry off their Serb minorities into some Habsburg nirvana, unless in the aftermath of a decisive military defeat. Mr Cviic concludes on a hopeful note, asserting that acquisition of territory is no longer \"the consuming preoc- cupation it once was\" and that leaders and peoples are both coming to understand that \"good economic performance is what makes states strong and stable\". But he admits, in an uncomfortable euphemism, that \"Yugoslavia's acceptance of that principle must await the resolution of the current messy but necessary reorder- ing process\". Edward Mortimer"

   "text_content" : "By Samuel Brittan -IIbefadletewflutteectiom^ T largely doetermied by \"the T economy\" l alnost certainl wrong. What is generaly meaat Is that*iroters are 1 argl .S eced by 'ort-term cyclical rIn vai ables such as prics, unemployment, or interest rates. This economc deter- minism is all too often coupled with the belief that the government sholda cynically manipulate both the elec- tion date and its economic policy to take advantage of voters' ty. Such reasoning too eay assumes that too many of the people can be fooled too much of the time. If the economy is artificially stimulated before elections and the brakes are put on afterwards, people will eventu ally sense they have been taken for a ride. One does not have to be a fully ledged believer in \"rational expecta- tions\" to see the folly of counting on voters never learning from events. Suspicion about economic models of voting is reinforced by the frequency with which the supposedly key vari- able changes. In the 1960s it was meant to be unemployment, with changes of a few decimal points swinging elections from government to opposition and back. The relation- nship collapsed when unemployment rates started to take off in the late 1960s and to soar in the 1970s. Politi- cal economists then tried out real dis- posable income, with mixed results. In recent years the favourite variable has been mortgage rates, which will also not bear the weight that has been put upon them. These musings received striking support in an investigation published by David Walton of Goldman Sachs on July 10. His preliminary caution is that we have only the vaguest ideas of the correct answer to the pollsters' question: \"What would happen if an election were held today?\" The esti- mates of government support in the opinion polls are subject to a margin of error of about 4 percentage points on either side - the difference under the curious British electoral system between a clear Conservative victory and a bad defeat. Another complication is that most economic models only attempt to explain the government's showing versus the main opposition parties. Yet the election outcome could depend on the Liberal Democrats. kven taking the polls at face value, Walton argues that the conventional economic variables explain only a small fraction of fluctuations in gov- ernment popularity. He finds that there is a very large inertia: the main influence on the poll rating in one quarter is that recorded in the previ- ous quarter. This could be open to the objection that economic factors could still be the key ones, but operating with a lag. In fact, however, non-economic shocks can be critical, and cannot be forecast in advance. Walton cites the Falklands factor before the 1983 elec- tions, and the winter of discontent before the 1979 one. Indeed, he has himself provided a dramatic illustration of his own the- sis. For the Goldman Sachs model suggested in July very little increase in Conservative support, as any MI II I I MIil 51 improvement from declining interest rates would be offset by rising unem- ployment. The last few weeks has demonstrated Walton's thesis that \"such projections are worth very lit- tie\". For since he wrote, John Major's nternational exposure, following the crises in the former Soviet Union, has overturned the model predictions. S o instead of speculating further on short-term changes, it might be worth looking at the underly- ing economic performance since the Thatcher government came to office in 1979. To make meaningful comparisons it is essential to take cyclically compa- rable periods. The best period to take has been between the peak of the ear- lier business cycle in 1979 and the peak of the last one in 1988 or 1989. The trend during this long cycle has then been compared with the cycles that preceded it. The conclusion has been that the growth gap between Britain and its main continental European competi- tors has indeed been closed, but mainly through a slowdown in Conti- nental performance. Britain's own growth performance was better in the 1980s than in the post-1973 cycle of mostly Labour government that suc- ceeded the first oil-price explosion. But it was not as good as performance in the preceding cycles of 1964-1973 under both Labour and Heathite Tory government. British performance in the most recent cycle has also been comparable with that of the US, if The conventional economic variables explain only a small fraction of fluctuations in government popularity allowance is made for differences in population movements. The gap with Japan has narrowed, but never been remotely closed. The peak of the last economic cycle is now, however, some way behind us. Is it possible to retain the same, even highly-qualified, optimism after the rise in inflation at the end of the 1980s and the steep recession of 1990-91? On inflation there are grounds for optimism. One reason why I have Annual growth rate of real qDP per UK OECD US Japan Europe 1967-72 3.2 4.2 1.2 8.4 1972-75 1.1 1.9 -0.4 2.4 1975.81 1.9 2.4 0.5 3.6 1981-91 1.6 1.7 1.1 3.0 UK Italy France Germany Japan US Output In 1989 (UK=100) GODP per head 100 100 100 97 122 149 102 120 109 104 115 127 106 07 139 144 134 204 abandoned the Teenagers' Guide to he Retail Prices Index (although not I ear to the trade figures) is that the normal comparisons of \"underlying\" .ear-on-year inflation understate the mprovement of recent months and the headline rate happens by a tempo- ary fluke to be a better guide. On present trends, underlying infla- ion will be back next year to the 3-4 per cent range last seen in 1986, but without the large drop in oil prices nwhich took place then. This time here will be a good chance of locking n the lower rates through the ERM membership which Mrs Thatcher vetoed last time round. What, however, has happened to the real economy? Has the recession had a lasting impact on performance? The only way of providing even a tentative answer is to compare not high, but low, points in the cycle. This has been done in the first table, rindly prepared by Anthony Garratt of the London Business School. There are obvious limitations. For 1991 we have had to rely on the LBS frecast rather than actual data. We 11 M 1 1111 5I I H represents the bottom of the cycle. While cyclical peaks are usually clear-cut, the dating of the trough is more controversial, as output tends to rise only slowly in the early stage Due to European slowdown, the growth gap between Britain and continental Europe has again almost vanished after a recession. Moreover, productiv ity has been very much worse in 1991, at least as officially measured, than it is likely to be in 1992 because of the lag in adjusting jobs to output. But having made all these qualifica tions, the main impression from- looking at the trend from the bottom of the 1981 recession to that of 1991 is fairly similar to that obtained from peak to peak comparisons. The -rnrrwth man i-n ' u tnut *er workeri b n Britin 'and': continental -4r44 has again almost vanished, bat due to the European slowdown rather than any British acceleration. Britain looks 6n this measure to hive exceeded'US growth in output per worker since the early 1970s, but con- tinues to lag behind Japan, although by smaller amounts. The really bad performance has been neither in growth nor inflation, but in unemployment. British experi- ence has been no worse than that of the European Community as a whole, but the EC has done lees well than the US, Japan or the countries of the European Free Trade Association - its unionised, but uncentralised, wage bargaining giving it the least attrac- tive of all worlds. My own reaction after long peering at growth tables is that it would be good to get away from gazing at rates of change and look instead at the actual levels of output that ultimately determine liv- ing standards. These are much more difcult to estimate. But the ones in the second table are as good as any available, being based on data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, com- pared at purchasing power parity exchange rates. The first and perhaps most reliable column of gross domestic product per head is the most reassuring. Britain emerges as slightly worse off than France and Germany, slightly better off than Italy and modestly worse off than Japan. The big surprise is how much the US remains ahead despite all the years of \"miracle\" growth in Europe and Japan. The second column of GDP per worker suggests that there is more cause for worry. For the very reason- able levels of British output are only achieved by having a larger propor- tion of the population at work. One favourable surprise is that British productivity still seems marginally higher than Japan's, so long as the whole economy rather than just man- ufacturing is taken into account. An alarmist would have to concen- trate on manufacturing, shown in the last column. Here British output per worker is well below not only that of Japan, but France, Germany and Italy as well. Thus, despite the productivity spurt in the Thatcher years, there is much further to go. The big surprise in the final column however lies in how far ahead US manufacturing productivity is, despite the doom-warnings of US advocates of a so-called industrial policy. The US has a smaller proportion of its labour force in manufacturing than most other countries, but obtains a very high output from it. There are some puzzling fractures in the table, such as the apparently large lead of France over Germany, which may be partly explained by the short German working week. But if we look at whole economies rather than just manufacturing, there is not all that much difference between the performance of one European country and another; and I doubt whether this is a statistical illusion. i",

   "text_content" : "or decades the Every- man Library of literary classics - motto: \"Ev- eryman, I will go with thee, and be thy guide. In thy most need to go by thy side\" - was a fixture on the British book- shelf. Its fortunes faded in recent years. Now they are being rlvived by Mr David Campbell, a book publisher, and Mr Mark Bicknell a banker, who hope to restore the library to its former glory. This month new editions of 48 novels - from Jane Aus- ten's Pride and Prejudice to Emrle Zola's Germinal - will be published. Another 80 titles wmill appear next year and at least 50 books a year after that. Everyman was founded in 1906 by Joseph Dent, a master book binder, whose declared aim was to produce 1,000 cheap, pocket-sized volumes of classic literature for \"every kind of reader; the worker, the student, the cultured man, the child, the man and the woman\". For many of its readers, Everyman offered the only opportunity to buy classics. By the late 1980s the library encompassed more than 1,200 titles and had sold more than 60m hardback books alto- gether. But the introduction of the paperback in the 1930s dealt a devastating blow to publishers of hardback fiction. Everyman had introduced its own paper. back Imprint, but not until 1960. By then Penguin paper- backs were selling classics at even lower prices than Every- man. In the late 1980s the Dent publishing empire was sold to Weidenfeld & Nicholson, a leading London publisher. Mr Campbell, who had been work. ing for Hachette, the French publishing group, and Mr Bicknell, a banker with Grind- lays in Paris, began negotia- tions to buy Everyman from Weidenfeld. They raised lim from a venture capital com- pany in the City to fund its acquisition and the relaunch. Mr Campbell is convinced there is a gap in the market for a hardback version of the classics, \"the books one wants to keep all through one's life\". He sees the new Everyman as an English version of La P16- lade, the collection of literary classics published by Galli- madin France. The choice of titles for the first set of books, which comes out next Thursday, is deliber- ately conservative. All are standard works by recognised writers, such as George Eliot's Middlemarch and Stendhal's Scarlet and Black. Each new book is bound in cloth and honours the Every- man tradition of using differ- ent colours to denote each cen- tury: green for the 18th, maroon for the 19th and so on. It also observes the old Every- man ethos of low prices. All the titles will sell for less than Â£10 in the UK and under $20 in the US, apart from Don Quix- ote, which weighs in at 1,068 pages and will cost Â£11.99. Everyman is one of the new breed of publishers, which retains responsibility for the editing and production of its books, but hands sales and dis- tribution over to a larger group, In this case Random House, the New York-based publishing giant which owns Alfred Knopf in the US and Random Century In the UK. This helps Everyman, which is based in London's Soho, to keep its costs to a minimum. It has pro-sold half the 10,000 print run of each book to Knopf. Mr Bicknell said it had also received a \"tremendous response\" from shops in the UK, including the large chains such as WH Smith, and was on course to break even by the end of next year. The new owners seem unabashed about the challenge of launching a new publishing house when both the US and UK book markets are depressed. Book sales in the UK so far this year are believed to be 10 per cent down on 1990. The owners argue that the classics have been unaffected by recession. Indeed both Penguin and Oxford University Press say their sales of classic novels have been relatively resilient. \"We are living in a world where book publishers are get- ting bigger and bigger,\" said Mr Campbell. \"But there is still room for companies like this with five people in pan- elled rooms above a sex shop in Soho.\"",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in The Hague MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday warned of \"formidable prob- lems\" in European Community negotiations on political union, but said he was \"increasingly confident\" of reaching agree. ...et on monetary union this year. Mr Major said that giving the European parliament greater lawmaking power was ony one of \"very many areas of difficulty\" for Britain in the political union negotiations. .hese have run parallel to those on economic and mone- tary union (Emu). His comments came after talks in The Hague with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, who currently chairs the EC Council of Ministers. Other UK government con- cerns centre on the Dutch pres- dency's proposals to bring the co-ordination of sensitive for- eign, crime and immigration olicy fully within Community decision-making machinery. Mr Lubbers responded to Mr Major's worries by saying that he would not use December's summit in Maastricht to try to gain agreement on \"a full, 100 per cent political union\". It would merely be \"a fur ther step\" towards eventual political union, the Dutch leader said. \"The speeds with which we can move forward together are different. We have to be a little more cautious on foreign and defence policy than on mone ary union,\" he acknowledged. By contrast, Mr Major said hat \"progress is self-evidently ::eing made\" on Emu. \"I am ncreasingly confident that we will be able to reach agreement on Emu when we reach the conference in Maastricht,\" he said. During his morning of talks with Mr Lubbers, the UK prime minister urged the Dutch presi- dency to stick to its proposals requiring strict economic con- vergence between EC states before they pool their currencies. The Dutch plan has yet to be pproved by the Lubbers cabi- net, let alone formally pres- ented to EC partners.

   "article_dc_title" : "Folkestone to Lose Ferry Port Role",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent FOLK ESTONE'S role as a terry port is to end after a decision yesterday by Sealink Stena Line, the UK ferry operator, to close the route between the port and Boulogne and shed 1,569 jobs. The move also casts doubt on the long-term viability of Boulogne as a ferry port after the Channel tunnel opens. The cuts follow Tuesday's announcement by Stena, Sea- link's Swedish parent, that Sealink's poor performance was dragging the group towards pre-tax losses of SKr300m (Â£2.2m) this year. Mr Gareth Cooper, Sealink's managing director, told employees yesterday that the company's survival depended on the changes being made. Sealink said it had always planned to close the Folkes- tone-Boulogne route when the Channel tunnel opened because its relatively low vol- ume of traffic would fall to a level where it would become unviable. The decision had been brought forward, it said, because the route was heading for losses ds Â£2.5m this year and a further year of losses could not be sustained. Since the 1970s Folkestone has been overtaken in impor- tance by Dover, which has been able to offer facilities for large modem ferries. Sealink is now the only ferry company operating out of Fol- kestone. After the last sailing departs on December 31, part of it will remain a fishing port and the rest will be converted to a marina and residential development by Sea Contain- ers, the port's owner. Boulogne has two other oper- ators apart from Sealink: P&O European Ferries and Hover- speed. It is widely believed in the ferry industry that competition from the Channel tunnel may eventually lead both compa- nies to consolidate their operations at nearby Calais. The closure of the Folkes- tone-Boulogne route will result in the loss of 568 jobs, some of them shore-based but most of them on the two Sealnk ves- sels plying the route. The ves- sels will be sold. Sealink said the rest of the job losses would be spread among its 4,534 seafarers and shore-based staff at all levels in Dover, Stranraer, Holyhead, Fishguard, Southampton, the Republic of Ireland and its headquarters in Ashford, Kent. The job cuts overlap with 860 redundancies' announced as part of a cost-cutting plan in October last year, only 400 of which have so far been achieved. Sealink, formerly state- owned but privatised in 1984, is Britain's biggest ferry operator after P&O. Weathering the storm, Page 8",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Alsn Smith LABOUR yesterday sought to shift the political battleground to the National Health Service, which it claims the Tories intend to privatise. However, political emphais on the economy resurfaced after the intervention of Mr Robin Iigh-Pemberton, gov or of the Bank of England, wao said Britain was comring out of recession. A rash of claims and counter-claims from senior ministeru and Labour spokes- men intensified the atmo- sphere of electioneering, although this shed little light on a possible poll date. Labour repeated its demand for an early election. Specula- tion about a November date has been cooled slightly by the most recent opinion poll which showed the two m parties neck-and-neck. The Tories dismissed Labour's health campaign as \"shoddy scare mongering\", but Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said the prime minister had shown his intention to make the NHS more dependent on the private sector. On Tuesday, Mr John Major had spoken of the scope for \"collaborative ventures\" between the NHS and the pr- vate sector. Mr Kinnock said: \"It is not collaboration, it is the colonisation of the NHS by pri vate meficine actively pro moted by the government.\" Mr Norman Lamont, chan cellor, accused Mr Kianock ol being inconsistent. \"If Mr Kin. nock can shed so quickly s many principles he believes in, how long will it take him to shed the principles he does not believe in?\" Mr Douglas Hurd, foreipg secretary, said the oppositei approach to public services remained rooted in the I- and 1970s, and would redu- choice and competition. \"heir twin-track approach consists merely of spending more and lmore controls.\" TMWTory party will sep up its campesn today, with the launch of a plitical magwine caDed Tronsrml Britin - which will emphaise Mr Major's vision for the future - and a party political broadcast.

   "article_dc_title" : "Racal Chief Bought 5m Shares Just before Hostile Bid",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay SIR ERNEST HARRISON, chairman of Racal Electronics, has made a Â£345,000 paper profit on 5m shares which he bought on Monday, only a day before the industrial conglom- erate Williams Holdings launched a hostile takeover bid for his company. The defence and security group yesterday rejected Wil- Hams's all-share offer, which was worth Â£693m last night. Although Racal's shares slipped Ip to 56%p yesterday, they stand 13 per cent above the average price at which Sir .rnest bought his stake. His purchase coincided with the effective date of Racal's demer- ger of Vodafone, the cellular telephone network operator. On Monday, Sir Ernest also sold a Â£5m stake - represent- ing at least half his stake - in Vodafone (formerly Racal Tele- communications) where he is non-executive chairman. Four other Racal directors bought a total of 1.49m shares on Monday. Advisers to Racal said it would have been \"improper\" for directors to have dealt before the shares became officially tradeable. They said the speed of the Williams bid had taken Racal by surprise and Sir Ernest's share purchases had been a vote of confidence in its future. Sir Ernest returned from hol- iday to a meeting with Racal's merchant bank advisers, N.M. Rothschild and Goldman Sachs, and its stockbroker, Smith New Court. After a board meeting, Racal rejected the industrial con- glomerate's three-for-20 all- share offer, saying it was \"unwelcome\" and significantly undervalued \"Racal's longer term potential\". Advisers said the Racal camp was in no hurry to respond further to the bid until Williams produced its offer, document spelling out more clearly what it would do with the group. Williams expects to post its offer document to Racal share- holders early next week. Its share price continued to weaken yesterday, losing 5p to 332p or 8 per cent below the closing value the day before the bid. As City analysts and share- holders gird themselves for the largest contested takeover bat- tle in more than a year, opin- ion was divided on how the contest would be resolved. Most fund managers said Williams's opening shot was not a \"knock-out blow\". They said its share price slide suggested it would need to introduce a cash element if it was to succeed and this would involve earnings dilution. Others said Racal and its advisers would find mounting a defence \"extremely tricky\". Racal, stripped of its stake in Vodafone, made a pro forma loss of Â£21.8m in the year to March.

   "text_content" : "Yesterday's profoundly de- pressing annual statement om Asda suggests that the pace of change in UK food retailing Is getting out of hand. The 29 per cent drop in Asda's shares was natural enough, being based partly on the fore- cast one-third cut in the interim dividend and partly on a belated realisation that Asda may well have no future as a national retailer. But it was significant that the shares of Asda's main competitors all weakened slightly as well. This will have been chiefly due to Asda's bleak picture of demand in the grocery trade overall. But it may also occur to the market that it is one thing for Tesco and Sainsbury to prey off Asda's weakness. It would be quite another matter if Asda were to dissolve entirely and its assets to pass into more effi- cient ownership. Such an outcome may not yet be certain, but it is getting steadily more likely. Last year's profits were down by a third from the peak of two years before. This year's could halve again. Next year holds little promise of recovery. All the time Asda's debt mountain looms, with a rights issue ruled out by the preemptive action of Asda's competitors and the absence of a chief exec- utive to deploy the proceeds. If the shares can no longer be priced on an earnings basis, the market is left to juggle with asset values. An outright takeover remains unlikely. A UK competitor would be de- barred, while new entrants are unlikely to be attracted to a market so stitched up by the industry leaders. If the chain is to be broken up, central assets such as the warehousing and distribution systems mostly represent wasted money. The stores themselves are obvi- ously worth something to somebody. Whether yester- day's market value of almost Â£800m is the right number is anyone's guess. British Gas The conclusion to be drawn from the supply contracts agreed by British Gas yester- day is that the threat of the law courts produces quicker redress than the regulator. The way for the Barking and Cory- ton power station projects to obtain industrial gas cheaply enough to make electricity generation economical has been to sue British Gas, settle out of court and use the money to subsidise prices. Having been forced by Ofgas to lower its prices, British Gas grudgingly agreed to supply souroqu: PelÂ«mn Ibn therms annually to a gen- eration market where demand is at least five times higher. It has now tied up in two genera- tion projects more than 80 per cent of that supply. It is hard to see grounds for immediate interference by the regulator, although rival would-be gener- ators will presumably push their claims of discrimination. But the issue shows British Gas in a bad light. It is Ironic that a lack of competition in one privatised industry is sti- fling the government's hopes for competition in another. Trade Indemnity On the surface, yesterday's 7 per cent fall in Trade Indem- nity's shares looks modest for a company which has passed its interim dividend just four months after a Â£39m rights issue. But the insurance com- panies which control three- quarters of its capital probably acquiesced grudgingly on the grounds that Trade Indemnity needs to conserve resources to write new business in the upturn. The fact that over a third of the Â£38m in new provisions came from commercial mort- gage insurance cannot be encouraging for the likes of Eagle- Star. Yet premium income is now growing at a healthy clip. The test for Trade Indemnity will be to hold on to its higher rates in what prom- ises to be a highly competitive market, whether or not the plan by NCM of Holland to buy the short-term business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department were to be scup- pered by a November election. The company will also need a European alliance if it is to survive the consolidation of the credit insurance industry after 199L2. Munich Re, its new 8 per cent shareholder, may be able to help as it also owns 50 PT-SE Imdex: 2,I3.e (.10.6) Asda Share prie relative to the FT-A Food Retalers Index r per cent in Hamburg-based Ienrmes. That would be a Ger- man solution, but it could offer an exit for UK insurance com- pany shareholders. By now they must feel they have had more than enough. Kwik-Fit One loud message from the two-thirds rise in Kwik-Fit's interim profits yesterday is that the replacement of tyr=s and exhausts cannot be deferred indefinitely, even in recessions. Another is that companies which stick to what they know, ruthlessly pursue emargins and success- illy motivate line manage- ment ultimately reap the re- ward of a higher rating. But now that the shares have out- performed the market by more than 80 per cent in the last year, there is a question of how much further they have to go. In the short term tyre ales hould be boosted by stricter EC requirements on tread aize and - if it sticks - by the manufacturers' 12.5 per cent -price increase. Demand for new exhausts is also expected to pick up as the better quality products introduced by car makers three or four years ago come to the end; of their ex- tended life. The only threat is serious competition, which - despite the effdrts of King- fisher and Halfords - has yet to emerge. The bilger Kwik-Fit becomes the more difficult it is to break in; but, with operating margins at 14 per cent, some- body might have another try. M&G It is certainly debatable whether M & G should still be considered the UK's pre-emi- nent fund management group. Nevertheless, those who say the company's investment er- formance has lost a little of its legendary shine can hardly quibble with its finely honed skills in marketing. The one-off decision to launch a Â£500m investment trust as the vehicle to cash in on demand fidor r- sonal Equity Plans is admira- bly consistent, not only in that the fund will be run like a unit trust but in that the front-end fees will be closer to the tradi- tionally high levels of the unit trust industry. One trusts that the indepen- dent intermediaries who will benefit will point out to client that plenty of existing UK investment trusts are trading on a discount to net assets, and that the use of financial gear ing which M & G eschews could be attractive at this stage in the cycle.",

   "text_content" : "lBy LjRobert Po1I THE rescue of Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, hinges on the agreement of three of Britain's biggest banks - Bar. days, National Westminster and Midland - which have been ref using to sanction a vital element in the Â£1.5bn refinancing plan, it emerged yesterday. The three clearers have a rela tively small exposure to Brent Walker. They say privately they would not be badly hurt if the company went into receivership. So their refusal to back the refil nancing calls into question the Bank of England's London Rules, intended to prevent banks with a small exposure to a troubled com- pany from blocking a rescue. In order that the refinancing takes place, Brent Walker needs to persuade holders of Â£100m of convertible bonds to exchange their bonds for new securities. Any deal with them requires the blessing of the banks. One set of proposals was accepted by the bondholders in June and backed by the steering committee of banks with the big- gest loans to Brent Walker. Most of the company's other 47 banks also gave their sanction. However, the three clearing banks blocked the deal and have not agreed to new terms. These banks have been vitriolic in their criticism of foreign banks which have tried to block the recon- struction of other companies. Last year, the Bank of England introduced its \"London Rules\", which were designed to ensure that banks discuss a corporate rescue plan in an orderly fashion and to prevent banks with small loans from overturning a rescue. \"'The Bank appears to have put little pressure on Barclays, Mid- land or NatWest,\" said one or Brent Walker's bankers. \"London Rules only seem to apply when the clearers want them to.\" Barclays, Midland and NatWest blocked the original proposals put to bondholders on a point of urinciple. The bondholders were lnsiating that they swap their bonds for an instrument that gave them influence in the event that Brent Walker needed to be refinanced a second time in the future. They therefore wanted to receive a debt instrument in exchange for their bonds, rather than equity. But the banks were converting part of their loans to Brent Walker into equity. The three clearers said they were ideologi- cally opposed to another class of creditor receiving a debt instru- ment when they were taking equity. They feel it would create an unfortunate precedent. However, Brent Walker insiste that the offer to bondholders in no way impaired the value of the banks' exposure to the company. It it currently in talks with the three banks to persuade them to agree to revised proposals to be put to bondholders at the end of the week. Brent Walker's banks yester- day rebuffed Lonrho's attempt to acquire the company. So Brent Walker's only hope of avoiding receivership is to persuade the bondholders to accept new terms. Brent Walker's merchant bank adviser, Hill Samuel, is trying to create a new instrument which looks like equity to the banks but like debt to the bondholders."

   "article_dc_title" : "WH Smith to Buy Virgin Stores Stake",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "he retailing group WH Smith, which owns the Our Price record chain, is to buy a 50 per cent equity stake in the UK retailing operations of Virgin Group, the privately- owned trading company founded by the extrovert Mr Richard Branson. The two companies are to form a joint venture to develop the Virgin Megastore and Games chains creating a formidable force in the UK music retailing and entertainments sectors. Together, Our Price and Virgin Retailing will control more than 30 per cent of the UK market. WH Smith yesterday released no financial details of its invest- ment and will only do so if the deal is approved by the Office of Fair Trading. But it is clear that WH Smith intends to put consid- erable financial muscle behind Virgin's retail expansion. Virgin currently runs 12 Megastores and seven games cen- tres but now looks set to acceler- ate its development programme by opening up to 85 stores over the next few years. In cultural terms the link-up appears an odd combination. WH Smith is widely viewed as one of the UK's more conservative retailing groups, run by the knighted duo of Sir Simon Hornby and Sir Malcolm Field, whose dress and demeanour betray their background as ex- Guards officers. In marked contrast, Virgin Group has been moulded in the image of the maverick Mr Bran- son, who formerly ran his diver- sified international business from a London houseboat, and who built his reputation as a record producer promoting bands such as the Sex Pistols. In commercial terms, however, there appears to be a close corre- lation of interests. Virgin Group, which has lacked access to equity financing since it was taken pri- vate by Mr Branson in 1988, needs further cash injections to develop its retailing business at the rate it desires - especially given that so much of Mr Bran- son's efforts and the company's resources are devoted to building up its airline interests. WH Smith, which raised Â£148m via a rights issue earlier this year, now has considerable sinan- cial flexibility but arguably lacks the retail formats to expand as rapidly as it would like. Trading links between the two stretch back a long time. WH Smith has bought books and records from Virgin for many years and in 1988 bought 67 smaller record stoes&from Virgin for E23m, leav- ing it to concentrate on develop- ing its megastore format. In contrast to Our Price's small format stores, the Virgin Megas- tores typically have in excess of 10,000 sq ft sales area and sell a wide range of recorded music, video, computer games and books. In the year to July 31 these stores recorded sales of Â£64.7m and had a net tangible value of Â£6m. The format has been translated abroad and Virgin Retail runs megastores in France, Italy, Japan and Australia often in con- junction with local partners. WH Smith will play no part in run- ning these operations. Under the deal, all new Our Price stores over 8,000 sq ft will trade as Virgin Megastores. The chairmanship of the joint venture will rotate annually between a Virgin and a WH Smith execu- tive, with Mr Branson taking the job for the first year. The manag ing director will be Mr Simon Burke, who has been running the Virgin retailing operation for the past three years. Speaking in Milan at the open ing of Virgin's first Italian Megas tore, Mr Branson revealed he had been approached by both WH Smith and another leading UK retailer about possible co-opra- tion about five months ago. N Among the \"variety of rea sons\" why WH Smith had been chosen was its retailing expertise and the fact that all new large stores would trade as Virgin Megastores, he said. WH Smith was also commited to invest \"quite considerable sums of money\" into the new operation. Mr Branson denied that the decision to sell half of Virgin Retail Group refected financial difficulties or the impact of the UK recession. The transaction had originally involved WH Smith taking only a 49 per cent stake. But WH Smith \"put more sugar in our cup\", leading to the current arrangement, he said. However, Mr Branson acknowl edged that Virgin was aware of the need for greater retailing expertise despite advances it has made in the past five years. WH Smith was a \"100 per cent retailing operation\", while the Virgin group had a range of other international interests running 120 companies in 23 countries. He accepted he could not give his ful atte ntion to retailin g. \": can't ~/ opeo$ ~VlrcJln/ Ikrk ~'Â· ~\";~d I P'DP\"Si~t~i do everything\", ne admitted The group has already raised around $150m (Â£87.2m) by selling 25 per cent of Virgin Music Group to Fujisankei Communica tions of Japan, and $60m for its games subsidiary to another Jap anese company, Sega Enterprise. Sales of minority stakes in its European and Far East retailing operations had raised $50m and $20m respectively, he added. Mr Branson said the Virgin group would pursue the same strategy in other areas \"where it could find value\". One possibility was the sale of more of Virgin Atlantic Airways, the group's air- line, in which Seibu Salson of Japan owns 10 per cent. He said the group was \"exploring the pos- sibility\" of divesting up to 20 per cent more of the shares, although no talks had yet begun.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd INSTITUTIONAL shareholders of Hanson, the acquisitive con- glomerate, yesterday voiced surprise at the company's choice of three new non-executive directors. In a move to head off criticism of its corporate governance, Han- son had drawn up a list of more than 100 possible candidates. Investors were surprised that the three announced yesterday were the best the group could find from such a long list. Sir Gordon Booth, a former nonexecutive director of Hason who chaired the committee which recommended the new appontments has been looldg for new nonexecutives for more than six months. Yet many of Hanson's big shareholder had never heard of oae of the three, Mr Jonathan Scott-Barrett, senior executive or Centaur Communications, a small publishing firm established in 1982 Mixed feelings were expressed about the other two nonexecu- tive directors, Mr Simon Kes- wick, director of Jardine Mathe- son Holdings and Mr David Hardy, chairman of London Docklands Development Corpora- tion. While both men were known by Hanson's investors, some institutions expressed reserva- tions about their being chosn. Sir Gordon said the three had been appointed because of their \"strong independent views\". Advisers to Hanson had vetoed some names as \"unsuitable\". The new nonexcutive dire- tors, who join the Hanson board at the beginning of next month, could change the way Hanson is run, sad Sir Gordon. \"There will be a mechanism of communication between execu- tive and non-executive directors\" said Sir Gordon. He added that the new non-ex- ecutives had also been chosen because of their entrepreneurial flair. The three will bring Hanson's non-executive directors up to five. The existing non-executive directors are Mr Charles Price, former US ambassador to London and Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels. The timing of the move also caused some surprise. Lord Han- son's advisers had recently made it known that the new appoint- ments were likely to be announced when the conglomer- ate reported its year-end results in December.",

   "text_content" : "By John Thornhill SHARES In Asda yesterday dropped by 29 per cent to 67p after the Leeds-based grocery chain warned of a \"very signifl- cant deterioration\" in its results for the current year. Sir Godfrey Messervy, chair- man, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting yes- terday that the effects of the recession coupled with the com- pany's high level of operational gearing would have a significant Impact on pre-tax profits. Analysts Immediately cut their forecasts for Asda's full-year profits to around Â£90m compared with last year's Â£173m. Shareholders took the news badly at an angry meeting last- ing almost four hours and a reso lution to raise the funds for the remuneration of non-executive directors from Â£60,000 to Â£100,000 was opposed by ordi- nary shareholders who forced a poll on the issue. The resolution was narrowly defeated by a show of hands but the proxy votes ol the big Institutional sharehold ers ensured it was carried by 91 per cent of votes cast. Sir Godfrey said that given the current trading experience 11 would be inappropriate to main tain its interim dividend and forecast a cut to not less than 1.25p compared with 1.85p lasi year. Asda's food sales rose 2 pel cent, excluding new floorspace in comparison with an industrn average of 3 per cent, he said However, once food price infla tion running at 5 per cent had been stripped out, sales acros the industry had shown a 2 pe cent decline during the firsi quarter of Asda's financial year. Mr Tony MacNeary, food retailing analyst at County Nat. West, said: \"Asda's prospects look pretty dismal.\" Lex, Page 20"

   "text_content" : "By Philip -Co.jM, Personal Finance Editor M&G, the fund unmagemeni group, yesterday launched the most substantial attempt to market a collective investmea fund in the UK since the i98 stock market crash. The group will mail 2.56 households, 10 per cent of the UK total, and conduct a heavy newspaper advertising cam- paign, in an attempt to raise up to Â£500m for the M&G Income Investment Trust. Sales of collective funds to the UK public have been depressed since the crash because the sharp falls in share prices worried private investors. However, some have -ecently shown interest in buy- ing investment trusts - closed-end funds - particu larly when held within a Per sonal Equity Plan (PEP), in which all income and gains are tax-free. The trust will be primarily marketed as a PEP, since the tax rules allow investors to put Â£6,000 into a new issue. Nor- mally, the maxrimum that can be invested in an investment trust PEP is Â£3,000. M&G is better known for managing unit trusts open-ended funds - than for investment trusts. Howeve. the marketing effort for thi new trust means that the fee will be closer to the -tradition ally higher levels of the uni trust indurstry. The initial charge will i between 5 per cent and .L76 pa cent, depending on the amoun raised. The investment trust ii being launched in split capita form, with three classes ol shares; capital, income and zero coupon. The zero dividend preference shares will have repaymeni priority; their initial assel value will be 34.5P, and the) will be redeemable at 102.461 in 2001, an annualised grose redemption yield of 11.5 pei cent. The income shares will receive all the trust's income after expenses; the forecasi annualised gross dividend is 6.55p per share. However, they will only be redeemed at 0.11 per share when the trust ih wound up in 10 years. The capital shares will receive all the assets of the trust after the zero dividend and income shares have been repaid. The initial asset value of the shares will be 59.95p; il the trust's assets grow at 11 per cent a year, they will be redeemed at 12M84 in 2001. This structure shou allow the trust to avoid the age-old problem of the investment trust industry, the discount at which trust share prices trade to their asset values. Private investors who buy the shares in PEP form, however, will be given a package of all three types of share; the shares can be traded separately after the launch. Trying to sell three classes of shares to the public was seen as too complex. The overall yield on the trust, which will invest in recovery stocks and smaller companies, will be 6.55 per cent at the offer price for the package of 100p. The trust is being launched mainly through an offer for subscription, which means the issue is not underwritten, although it will not go ahead if it raises less than Â£20m. SG Warburg will be conduct- ing a separate placing, under which it will sell the zeroes and a further package of the income and capital shares. The offer will close on October 17 and dealingn should begin on October 29. See Lex",

   "text_content" : "By IJonwen Malddox LONDON FORFAITING, the specialist trade finance house, almost doubled interim pre-tax profits, from Â£3.33m to Â£6.61m, as bank caution about credit risks allowed it to raise its margins. Mr Stathis Papoutes, manag- ing director, said the company had seen less competition and that banks \"were less hungry for international assets\", demanding higher rates on loans which had helped its own margins. While volumes in the six months to end-June were \"slightly ahead of last year\", trading income rose to Â£7.92m (24.64m). Forfaiting involves the provi- sion of trade finance through fixed rate loans which are sold at a discount to investors such as banks. Mr Papoutes also attributed the success in the half to active trading of the loan book. Administrative costs were held at Â£3.4m (Â£3.3m) despite the trading income increase. Net interest receivable was Â£2.1m (Â£1.99m). The level of forfaiting assets fell to Â£95m in June from Â£120m at the end of 1990, partly because of a downward valua- tion of undisclosed east Euro- pean assets. Net tangible assets were Â£105.9m, or 105.9p per share. Despite this strehgth, the interim dividend is maintained at 2.625p on earnings of 5.02p (2.09p) per share. Mr Papoutes remained \"bull- ish\" about the outlook - although the appetite of the banks for loans might improve next year, the impact on mar- gins could be limited \"as it is scarcely a perfect market\"."

Taxable profits of Â£1.9m (2.1m) were recorded for he six months to June 30, described as \"the most difficult environment in our history.\" The 15 per cent rise in turn- over to Â£73m (Â£63.3m) was due o the inclusion of BBDO, whose client list features Pepsi-Cola and Gillette. But turnover in AMV and Leaga Delaney, the existing agencies, fell slightly. In March AMV absorbed BBDO, one of the London arms of Omnicom, the US-based agency, paying net asset value of Â£78,000 and Â£2.4m costs. This year Omnicom also paid Â£7.5m for the 22.5 per cent stake in AMV previously held by WPP, Mr Martin Sorrell's marketing services company. Mr Peter Mead, chief execu- tive, said that getting to know the BBDO clients had inevita- bly added to overheads. Interest receivable of some Â£400,000, the same as last time, was earned on average cash balances in the half year of Â£6m, about ilm up on the pre- vious year. Earnings fell to 8.63p (9.6p) but the interim dividend advances to 2.8p (2.7p). In the half year, the group won new accounts worth an annualised turnover of Â£24m, including Ski Yoghurt and Wella haircare, of which a third was due to BBDO.",

'The group, which operates on a three-year accounting basis, does not declare profits t the half-year stage.

   "text_content" : "By Pggy Hollinger reporting wanrmin CALOR GROUP, the bottled gas supplier 44per cent owned by SHV, the Dutch investment company, lifted interim profits by 73 per cent, thanks largely to last winter's cold snap and volatile gas prices. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose from Â£l&9m to Â£32.7m on turnover up 38 per cent at Â£214.4m (Â£160.9m). However, an unchanged interim dividend of 6p is declared. Mr Michael Davies chairman, said that the board intended to build up retained earnings to provide for invest- ment in the company's devel- oping businesses. Mr Folkert Schukken, Calor chief executive and a vice-pres- ident of SHV, said the results had proved Calor's policy of spending on gas storage capac- ity. \"When prices rose rapidly we were in the advantageous position of having a cheaper product available,\" he said. In the early part of last year, winter gas prices more than quadrupled over the levels of the summer. It would be nor- mal to see Just a doubling of prices, Mr Schukken said. Measures to improve produc- tion efficiency had also helped boost profits and margins. However, Mr Schukken warned that margins would be tighter in the second half, due to higher gas prices this summer. This had hindered Calor's efforts to store a sizeable quan- tity of cheaper gas for the win- ter, he said. Calor was also suffering a decline in its main cylinder butane business which would have adverse profit implica- tions, he said. The group's other main division, bulk pro- pane - used in central heating and cooking - had been hard hit by the decline in the UK property market. \"That is tra- ditionally a growth business,\" said Mr Schukken, \"but it has now stagnated.\" Provisions of Â£6m (Â£5.4m) were taken for asset write- downs and reorganisation costs. Two small acquisitions in the core UK gas business had had a negligible effect on income. Mr Schukken said the group planned to expand through Pam Gas, its joint venture with SHV in eastern Europe. Pam Gas was building a successful business in the cooking sector in Poland and Czechoslovakia, he said. Earnings per share advanced 75 per cent to 13.3p (7.6p). Interest charges were almost halved at Â£1.4m (Â£2.7m). * COMMNT Calor's chief executive must one of the few people in Britain who prays for bad weather. And obviously he was in favour earlier this year. How- ever, the big question is whether Mr Schukken will be so lucky this time round. Also, cautionary noises on Calor's two main businesses leave strong doubts about future growth. Eastern Europe could be the group's best long-term prospect. But developing that business will almost certainly mean a rights issue. Which brings us to the dividend. Does Calor boost the pay-out - and thus the share price before a retained profit? Or does it maintain slow dividend growth at the expense of the share *rice? Hints in the statement mply the dividend will misuffer. Pre-tax forecasts range from 742.3m to Â£54m, depending on the weather, with a p/e of 9.4 to 11.8. An historic yield of about 6.6 per cent looks good ini- tially, but growth prospects are Sim.

It has also paved the way for the Australian group which owns nearly 30 per cent to increase its stake to between 42 and 49 per cent without launching a bid for the whole group. The 3-for-8 Issue is priced at s45, compared with yesterday's onening level of 55p. The clos- ing price was 2p lower. tr Ian Stevenson, finance director, said it was not a res- cue rights issue. \"We had sufficient other ammunition to deal with any potential problems.\" The group had not at any time exceeded the Â£18.3m borrowing limit agreed with its bankers. Debt had not come down as quickly as hoped because fur- ther funding had gone to the RFM national network in France, which was close to breaking even, and because of advances to Independent Radio News, which had yet to be reimbursed. There had also been a delay in realising cash from asset sales. More than Â£lm was expected to come in following the merger of Mercury, in which Crown had a 26 per cent stake, with County Group, another southern radio con- cern. Crown reported a pre-tax def- icit of Â£4.68m for the six months to March 31. Improve- ments, particularly at LBC, are expected to limit second-half losses to less than Â£2m. The company said that looking to the longer term \"there are clear signs of a recovery in national advertis- ing revenue for the radio industry as a whole.\" After the issue, the Austra- lian Darling Downs group, headed by Mr David Hayes, who is also Crown's chief ekes utive, will have up to 4 per cent of the equity, even though it is not taking up its rights. It is exchanging prefered shares, which might have con- verted into a larger holding, for 21m ordinary shares. After placing 8.3m shares, it will add the remainder to its eisting stake.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger KWIK-FIT Holdings, the automotive parts retailer, yes- terday beat analysts' most opti- mistic predictions with a 67 per cent rise in interim profits to Â£16.8m. Analysts upgraded forecasts for the full year from Â£26m to about Â£31m. The shares jumped 14p to close the day at 169p. The rise from Â£l0.1m was achieved by cutting costs and improving margins throughout the group, said Mr Tom Farmer, chairman. However, the slowdown in new car sales and the increas- ing reliance of consumers on used vehicles had helped. Turnover for the six months to August 31 was up 16 per cent to Â£130.3m. Price rises of about 8 per cent accounted for half of the increase. Operating margins widened from 9.9 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Mr Farmer said this was partly due to increased sales of higher margin products such as braking systems, which were up 20 per cent. Tyre and exhaust sales, the largest part of the business, rose by 18 per cent. The group said it expected tyre sales to benefit in the sec- ond half from legislation in January requiring deeper tread depths. The fleet business, which services company cars, had shown a strong advance with sales up 32 per cent. The expansion programme of previous years had been cur- tailed to help cut costs, although some 33 outlets had been opened in the previous 12 months. Kwik-Fit claims 594 retail outlets in the UK, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands and Belgium, and plans to have 615 by the year-end. Mr Farmer said that by the beginning of next year the group would see expansion activity again. Capital expenditure during the six months was Â£7m, and would be about Â£llm by the end of the year. In 1990, Kwik-Fit spent Â£34m on fixed assets. In respect of the second half, Mr Farmer said: \"We had a good six months last year and there is no reason to believe that we will not have a good six months this year.\" Debt fell from Â£20m at the year-end to Â£15m. Interest charges were more than halved to Â£1.3m (Â£2.9m), and were covered more than 14 times by operating profits of Â£18m (Â£12m). Earnings per share rose 78 per cent to 7.01p and the interim dividend is increased by 0.25p to 1.35p. See Lex",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper IN SPITE OF continuing softness in international insur- ance markets, falling interest rates, and the weakness of the dollar, Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance and reinsurance bro- ker, yesterday reported a 12 per cent increase in interim profits from Â£4.73m to Â£5.29m pre-tax. Earnings per share for the six months to end-June rose to 9.92p (9.89p), although the issue of shares over the past 12 months limited the rate of increase. The interim dividend is increased to 4.25p (4p). The results were adversely affected by the weakness of the dollar against sterling. Higher growth in operating profits to Â£2.44m (Â£1.44m) was only par- tially offset by slower growth in investment and other income to Â£2.84m (Â£3.1m), with average sterling and dollar interest rates significantly below 1990 levels. Turnover climbed by 36 per cent to Â£20.5m (Â£15.1m), struck before a 32 per cent rise in expenses to Â£18.1m (Â£13.7m). The growth partially reflected effects of acquisitions made in 1990, including full contributions from the WS Moody group, acquired in August 1990, and from SBJ Speciality and Martin Perry, which were bought in the first half of 1990. The Moody acquisition boosted income in the UK cor- porate risks and employee ben- efits areas, which accounts for about 25 per cent of brokerage income. Expenses have been kept in check with SBJ retaining only about 100 of the 220 staff who were part of the WS Moody group. SBJ's non-marine broking activities grew substantially as a result of the expansion into international facultative rein- surance and wholesale busi- ness. That rating environment is mixed with a contraction in the marine reinsurance market offsetting the beneficial effect of rate rises. Although the energy broking business did well, income from the US was depressed by the competitive state of the mar- ket. Mr Tony Keys, finance direc- tor, was bearish about insur- ance rates for industrial risks business in both the UK and the US. \"There is no sign of a significant upturn in rating. It is not there in the market- place.\" The weakness of the dollar against sterling had its effect on the results. Dollar income - which accounts for 35 per cent of the total - was sold or valued at $1.70 per Â£1, produc- ing an exchange gain against the average rate of exchange for the period of $1.78 to the Â£1. This compares with $1.59 to the Â£1 in the first half of 1990."

Gold production cuts loss at Ivernia West A profit from gold mining operations in Australia helped Ivernia West, the County Lim- erick-based exploration group, report reduced attributable losses for the year to March 31. The outcome - I1138,965 (Â£127,972) against IS384,770 - came on turnover from gold sales of 12757,220 and was struck after written-off explora- tion expenditure of I332,201 (IM60o,311). Production from the Double A mine in Western Australia commenced last Sep- tember and \"significant quanti ties\" had been produced. Exploration expenditure in the period increased from I1374,655 to IEL17n reflecting increased activity at Lisheen, the highly prospective zinc/ lead venture near the Tipper- ary and Kilkenny border.

Yesterday Mr Beazer was at Grosvenor Place, Hanson's London headquarters, to meet with Lord Hanson, the group's chairman (pictured right) to discuss strategy. It was the first time the two men had met since the bid was announced on Monday. Seven days ago Mr Beazer was facing the dismemberment of the housebuilding, contract- ing, property development and aggregates bust- nesses he had constructed during the 1980s via a series of acquisitions in the UK and the US. Beazer, with debts of Just over Â£lbn and shareholders funds of Â£1.lbn, had proposed to float off its UK based housebuilding, contract- ing and property businesses - until Lord Han- son stepped in. The proceeds from the flotation, expected to raise approaching o500m, were to have been used to reduce debts of the group which would have retained its US aggregates businesses. Instead Hanson, which already owns ARC, one of the top four UK aggregates companies, is poised to take over the second largest aggre- gates operation in the US - which Mr Beazer would continue to run but under changed own- ership. The two men clearly had a lot to talk about yesterday.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd BnrriTSH Telecommunieations should shed another 10,000 job o of the 10,000 it is reapd %planninig *this year, according to research pub. lished yW terday by SG War- burg Secrities. IWarbrg Securities is advis- Ing the government on the sale of about half of its BT share- holding, worth more than Sb.n, In November. BT reduced its workforce by 189800 last year and has ndt- cated that another 10,000 will go. Yesterday It confirmed that an additional 10,000 job losses were possible. Warburg Securities believes that the remaining Â£178m pro- vision for redundancies - which was put aside under BT's reorganisation pro- gramme, Operation Sovereign - will cover another 10,000 job losses. Compared with other large telecommunication companies BT is significantly less effi- dent. Mr James Golob, War- bnrg Securities' director, said: \"BT's manning levels are out of line with the rest of the world.\" The telecommunications industry measures efficiency levels by comparing the num- ber of service customer lines per employee. BT's average is 124 compared with the conti- nental European telecommuni- cation operator's average of 186 and the US telecommuni- cation operator's 221. Part of the gulf can be put down to different working practices in regard to civil engineering and installation, with more work subcon- tracted. But Mr Golob believes that working practices could only account for one third of the difference. Mr Barry Romeril, BT's finance director, is determined to cut costs further. Warburg believes the temptation to use up the provisions in Operation Sovereign, which would not affect the profit and loss account, will be irresistible. Warburg Securities is bull- ish about BT's prospects for two main reasons. * It says the regulation by Oftel, the Office of Telecommu- nications, is tough but work- able. Mr Golob argues that further regulation will not sig- nificantly affect BTs market share because of a unwilling- ness by its rivals to invest in telecommunications. Apart from international calls, Mr Golob said most potential com- petitors would find it too expensive to take on BT. * The political risk of a Labour government has been over-stated. Mr Golob believes Labour would be a less doctri- naire supporter of de-regula- tion and would favour UK companies over foreign inves- tors.",

   "text_content" : "VENTERSPOST GOLD MINING COMPANY LIMITED (Incorporate In the Republic of South Africa) Registration No. 05/056320/06 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS During 1988, the company acquired substantial additional reserves in an area adjacent to Its mining title'in-order to increase the mine's flexibility and extend its life. In January 1990, in order to finance the expenditure necessary to bring the extension area to production, shareholders were offered the right to subscribe for 2 500 000 linked units in the ratio of 10 units for every 100 shares held in the company, at a price of R65 per unit Each unit consisted of 10 deferred shares and 3 options. Each option entitled the holder to subscribe for one deferred share. Pursuant to the rights offer, 25 000 000 deferred shares and 7500000 options were issued. The conditions relating to the options provide, inter alia, that each option entitles the holder to subscribe for one deferred share at a subscription price of R6,50 per deferred share, between 1 November 1991 and noon on 30 November 1991. At the close of business on Monday, 16 September 1991, the latest practical date before the finalisation of this document, the closing prices of the deferred shares were as follows:- The Johannesburg Stock Exchange: R1.55 (155 cents). The London Stock Exchange :35p. As the current stock exchange prices for a deferred share are materially lower than the subscription price of R6,50 per deferred share, it appears unlikely that any option holders will exercise their options unless prices improve markedly. In case any option holder does wish to subscribe for deferred shares during November 1991, the necessary documentation can be obtained from the company's Johannesburg Transfer Secretaries or the United Kingdom Registrar. The 1990 rights offer referred to above, raised approximately R160 million, net of expenses. At that time it was envisaged that, upon the exercise of the 7 500 000 options issued pursuant to the rights offer a further amount of some R50 millon would be raised in November 1991. In his review incorporated in the company's 1991 annual report, which is being posted to members on 19 September 1991 and which provides up-to-date information regarding the operations and financial position of the company, the Chairman states: \"The development of the extension area above 10 Level will proceed as planned. However, alternative plans for the deepening of the shaft to open up the deeper parts of the extension area will have to be considered if the budgeted R50 million is not raised in November this year\". As it would be unrealistic, in present circumstances, to expect option holders to exercise their options in terms of the existing conditions, subject to the approval of the option holders, and of the ordinary and deferred shareholders, it is proposed to amend the conditions relating to the options by entitling the holders of the options which are not exercised during November 1991, to be exercised instead during November 1992. As the deferred shares will be automatically converted into ordinary shares on 1 July 1992 and thereafter rank pari passu with all the company's other ordinary shares, the proposed amended conditions relating to the options will entitle the holder of each option, inter alia, to subscribe for one ordinary share at a subscription price of R6,50 per share, between 1 November 1992 and noon on 30 November 1992.

The group has 50 operating units in 20 countries and inter- ests ranging from the construe tion and automotive sectors to telecommunications and com- puters.

The dividend, however, is lifted 5 per cent,91.7p (1.62p). The largest 6fall in demand came in the UK, where the order -intake was down 12 per cent. Operating profit from U activities declined 28 per cent to Â£3.9m, comprising 19 per cent (25 per cent)'of group operating profits. The weakness in the UK was countered by buoyancy in Ger- many, underpined by the resilience of the German auto- motive industry. The group expects further growth in Ger- many, based on demand. from the east, and is increasing capacity there. European operating profit, excluding the UK, was slightly higher comprising 43 per cent of the group total, up from 39 per cent in 1990.

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen 1Maddox MiR RODNEY Fitch, chairman o Fitch-RS, the design consultancy yesterday announced an interim pre-ta3 loss of Â£680,000 and said the compan) had \"been through hell... the firsi quarter was the worst in our history.\" The decline from a profit of Â£500,0C' reflected the severity of the recession and forced the company to suspend it; preference and ordinary dividends foi the second time. Turnover in the six months to Junt 30 fell by 28 per cent to Â£8.62m (Â£12m) a: UK retail design work suffered, both ir new property development and nem concept refurbishment. However, success in winning con tracts in the US and Far East helped take overseas turnover to Â£5.5m (Â£4.8m), 64 per cent of sales, against 40 per cent last year. A reduction in costs allowed the company to improve profits before interest to Â£613,000, from a loss of Â£5,000. The company last year cut its UK staff numbers sharply, pulling the group total back from 500 to 360. The Elm rise in net debt to Â£7.7m since the year end pushed interest pay- able to Â£536,000, compared with Â£464,000 interest receivable. The Â£752,000 exceptional cost reflected further redundancies and the carrying cost of unoccupied property. Losses per share were 12.3p, against earnings of 2.2p. The company has decided to withhold dividend payment on the ordinary shares. Last year's failure to pay a final dividend left the total at 1.5p. Fitch has also suspended the 3p payment on the cumulative preference shares due on October 1, following the suspension of the April payment. Mr Fitch said: \"We have no choice - we have no distributable reserves at the moment - but we hope to return soon to a dividend policy.\" Despite the disappointing results he was now \"very bullish\" about the inter- national outlook and confident about the UK. * COMMhNT The group's bullishness is welcome, though understandably based more on overseas optimism than UK improve- ment. The share price hangs, however, on it meeting City expectations of breakeven for the year, meaning a second half pickup. The present borrowing facilities of E8m are only slightly above present net debt of Â£7.7m and would need renego- tiating if that pickup was not on sched- ule. True, the recovery in Fitch's business seems well underway, particularly in the US, and it was prompt in reducing UK costs, but its financing position con- tinues to make it of particular interest, as well as a general barometer of the property market and corporate discre- tionary spending.",

   "text_content" : "By Jae Fuller COMMUNITY Hospitals Group, the private medical company, Increased annual tax profit from 5.7m to Â£5.81m, although the previous year benefited from the Â£l.lm sale of a stake in another hos- pital company. Operating profit in the 12 months to June 30 rose 32 per cent to Â£5.7m (4.33m) on sales of as1m (128.1m). The share price gained 4p to close at 219p, within Ip of its July 1989 high. Following a 1-for-3 rights issue in February, which raised Â£10.4m, net debt was limited'to Â£4m at the year-end. Sir Peter Thompson: this year had started well tive, said that figure would rise to Â£20m this year and gearing was anticipated at between 30 and 35 per cent by next June. It was comfortable with a ratio of 50 per cent. The group raised Â£20m when it floated in May 1989. Mr Dex- ter said Â£50m would have been spent on hospitals and homes in the three years between flo- tation and June 1992. \"The bulk of the develop- ment programme will then be complete,\" he said. CHG would have 10 hospitals with 480 beds and eight nursing homes with 413 beds. Part of the plan was to build \"close care\" units on some of the sites, where elderly people would have their own homes but be able to hire services, such as laundry, from the nursing home or hospital. \"The Government White Paper, Care in the Community, wants people cared for in their own homes. We want to bring their homes nearer to the care complex,\" he said. The hospitals increased operating profit by 29 per cent to Â£4.9m on turnover of Â£31m. The proportion of revenue derived from day and out patients was being driven up. Operating profit from nurs- ing homes rose 60 per cent to Â£800,000 on sales of Â£4.3m. Both operations were prov- ing recession resistant because of the increasing level of pri- vate health insurance and the growing number of elderly people in the population. Sir Peter Thompson, chair- man, said: \"The current year has started well with little sign that the recession has impacted on our healthcare activities.\" Earnings per share, affected by increased equity, were 15.6p, compared with 16.5p including the exceptional gain and 13.4p without it. The divi- dend goes up to 6p (5.2p), with a flinal of 3.8p. * CHG will give a \"best view\" of its expected profit for this year when it reports its interim results next March. Observer, page 18",

   "text_content" : "y William IJawkidns in Paris ALCATEL Alsthom, the French electrical engineering nd telecommunications group, yesterday published a 32 per cenat rise in net profit for the est half of the year, including a heavy exceptional gain. The group's net income after minorities rose from FFrl.97bn (S30m) in the first six months of 1990 to FFr2.59bn in the same period of this year. The result includes a FFr630m non- recurring profit from the sale of Alcatel Alsthom shares to Flat, the Italian automotive group, as part of the alliance they announced last year. Alcatel Alsthom's net income declined fractionally to FFr1.96bn if the exceptional profit is stripped out. Sales rose by 9 per cent to FFr74.77bn in the first half, Ithough the underlying gain comes down to 6 per cent, adjusting for the impact of acquisitions such as Telettra, the former Fiat telecommuni- cations subsidiary of which Alcatel Alsthom took control as part of the partnership deal. The group forecast that overall sales growth for the year should be in line with the first half. Income before excep- tional items would rise more slowly than in the first six months, but still \"substantially exceed sales growth,\" said Alcatel. Operating profits after finance costs rose by 26 per cent to FFr6.55bn, reflecting better margins across the group's main divisions, but especially in the Alcatel tele- communications business, the company said. Earnings per share rose from FFr15.3 to FFr17.4, excluding non-recurring items."

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins CERUS, the troubled French Holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Ital- ian financier, yesterday announced a change of man- agement and denied rumours that it was planning to sell its banking unit. Mr Jacques Letertre resigned as managing director of Cerus and chairman of Banque Dumnnil Lebl6, posts he has held since the Italian financier took control of the bank three years ago. His departure comes two months after Dumdnil Lebld discovered that its latest acqui- sition had been subject to a LlOObn ($77.22m) fraud involv- ing Italian shares. The bank involved, Geneva-based Assets Development Bank, used to belong to a member of the Dumdnil family. Mr Letertre's departure is friendly and there is no suggestion that he is in any way being held accountable for the Swiss scandal, said a senior Cerus official. His replacement at Cerus is Michel Cicurel, who has since late 1989 been managing direc- tor of Galbani, the Italian cheese subsidiary of BSN, the leading French food group. There will also be a new chair- man at Dumdnil Leble: Mr Michel Garbolino, currently managing director of the investment group Elysdes Investissements. Both posts are to be con- firmed at a Cerus board meet- ing in the next few days. The change also reflected Cerus' wish to concentrate on being the \"operator\" of its main investments - a control- ling minority in the Valeo com- ponents group; Dum6nil Lebl6; and Cofir, a Spanish holding company - said Mr De Bene- detti. The bank would remain as a stable holding in Cerus. Over the past year, Cerus has concentrated on curbing its debts by selling non-essen- tial assets, including its hold- ings in the Yves Saint Laurent fashion group.",

   "text_content" : "By Wiliam DullouCe In Geneva RIETER; the Swiss textile machinery group, yesterday diueled a l per cesnt decline In consolidated turnover to S1R94m (14m> In sthe fist seven months of the year. Earnings for the year as a whole were likely to be cousid- erably lower than those for 190, the company warned Last year's results were badly hit by the slump in demand for ieter's pinning machines. For 1990, the group poeda per cent fall to 36.8m in net consolidated earnings, and halved its divi- dend. When Saurer Group Hold- ing, Swiss financier Mr Mr to Tettamanti's parent company, bought 6.7 per cent of the capi- tal and 5 per cent of the voting rights in Rieter in March, Mr TIto and Rieter denied reports in Swiss newspapers that Saurer planned a takeover. In June, Saurer bought Schlafhorst, a bhi German manufacturer of textile machinery and a direct com- petitor of Rieter's. At the time, Mr Tettamanti stressed the need for European producers to concentrate their forces in order to remain competitive against aggressive Japanese groups. A 25 per cent dive to SFr421m in sales of its spinning machines was the crucial element in Rieter's seven-month turnover decline this year. Sales by Unikeller, its noise control division which depends heavily on the car industry, dropped by only 1 per cent to SFr347m.

   "text_content" : "by Smian Waigyl in Tokyo JAPAN's Big Four securities companies yesterday warned that results for the half-year to the end of thistmonth would be far below their mpevious for1- casts due to a sluminpinbui ness on Tokyo's scandal-sf- fcted stock market. Yamalche Securities, smal- :st of the Big Four, said It would suffer a Y12ba (tL9m) pre-tax loss. It will be the first time any of the large er- aes has fallen into the red ince the prolonged bear imar ket of the.mid-1960s. Then, too, 'amaichi suffered the ijiost of the Big Four and it had to be rescued from bankruptcy by the authorities. The other three large houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, and Nikko Securi- ties - all predicted sharp declines in interim profit. Nomura forecast a 67 per cent rfa in pre-tax profits irom the same period last year, to '37bn; Daiwa a 77 per cent drop to Y16bn; and Nikko a 70 uer cent fall to Y1Obn. The fig- ures, which are for the parent ompanies, represent a sharp downward revision of forecasts made as recently as June. The results for Japan's 250 or so small and medium-sized bro- kerages are expected to be Frantic dealsr ruh a tradiing counter during a o stock market slide much worse, with most compa- nies likely to report losses. The biggest impact on the securities companies has been the decline in stock exchange turnover. Investors have turned away from stock invest- ment in response to a rise in interest rates and because of a series of scandals which have undermined faith in the mar- ket. Private individuals, a lucrative market in the past, have been shaken by evidence of brokers compensating large clients, and of two houses - Nomura and Nikko - having dealings with a criminal organ- isation. The market's weakness has also forced companies hoping to issue securities to cancel their. plans, so reducing to a trickle the brokers' flow of underwriting income. The houses' profits have also been hit by revaluation losses on their own stock holdings. One reason for Yamaichi's particularly poor performance is that the company seems to have suffered especially severe evaluation losses. An official said, \"We were very aggressive in the first quarter ofte year, from January to March; we were caught by surprise when the market fe by 17 per cent from the end of March.\" The financial stability of the Big Four is not in immediate jeopardy. All accumulated sub- stantial reserves in the late 19BOs, when Nomura temporar- ily became the biggest profit earner in Japan. Nomura is believed to have sufficient income from interest alone to pay its wage bill. Nevertheless, with no solid recovery in prices or in turn- over in sight, prospects for the second half of the year were not good, the brokers warned. Also, the scandals have intensified pressures for reform of the stock market. The introduction of tougher rules will raise costs as brokers are forced to spend more on supervision. Moreover, the affairs have prompted demands for more cuts in stock exchange commission income. Critics see Japan's system of fixed-rate commission as one reason why brokers paid com- pensation to big clients. Unable to compete on commission rates, brokers offered other incentives.",

   "text_content" : "SKANDIA, Scandinavia's biggest insurer, is emerging as the keystone of a pan-Nordic insurance alliance following the announcement on Tuesday that Norwegian insurer Uni Storebrand has become a major shareholder in the Swed ish group. Uni Storebrand, which acquired 11.4 per cent of Skan- dia for SKrl.5bn, is the second Nordic insurer to obtain a stake in Skandia. Pohjola, the Finnish insurer, already holds 10.5 per cent. Uni Storebrand's interven- tion in Skandia may be designed to block possible plans by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the largest shareholder in Skandia, to sell its stake to a non-Nordic group. S-E-Banken, Sweden's largest bank, last year acquired an option to take a 28.2 per cent holding in Skan- dia in anticipation that it would merge with the insurer to form the region's most pow- erful bank-insurance group. John Burton and Karen Fossli look behind Uni Storebrand's acquisition of a large stake in Scandinavia's biggest insurer However, Skandia's manage- ment has resisted merger pro- posals, and recent changes in the banking law would force S-E-Banken to tie up a large amount of its capital reserves if it went ahead with the deal. This has increased chances that the bank might sell its Skandia share. S-E-Banken welcomed the Uni Storebrand move, creating speculation that it might sell its option to the Norwegian insurer, which emerges as the second largest shareholder in Skandia. Mr Bo Ramfors, the S-E- Banken president, noted that he was ready to hold discus- sions with Uni Storebrand about the restructuring of the bank and insurance sectors in Sweden and the rest of Scan- dianina. Mr Jan-Erik Langangen, the Uni Storebrand president, has made no secret of his ambi- tions to make Norway's biggest insurer a financial powerhouse in the region. Possible funding for such an expansion could come from the Norwegian state oil company, Statoil, whose chairman is Mr Langangen. Capital-rich Statoil was granted the right earlier this year to invest in non-oil operations. Uni Storebrand's purchase of Skandia shares may also be linked to an attempt to consoli- date its position in the Norwe- gian insurance sector as it gains an indirect stake in Vesta, the Norwegian insurer acquired by Skandia two years ago. Uni Storebrand denied yesterday that the company had the intention of seeking control Vesta. The Norwegian Finance Min- istry, however, is keeping a close watch on developments to prevent Uni Storebrand, which already has a 40 per cent share of the Norwegian insur- ance market, from gaining a dominant position as a result of the Skandia deal. * Mr Eric Penser, the Swedish businessmen whose financial empire collapsed two weeks ago because of heavy losses, yesterday alleged that Skan- dinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's largest bank, conspired to destroy him, writes Robert Taylor in Stock- holm. In an interview in the busi- ness magazine Veckans Affarer, he suggested he had been the \"victim of a clever and calculated conspiracy\". Mr Roger Holtback, the head of SEB's office in Gothenberg has strongly rejected the alle- gation.",

The banks' willingness to grant further credits to Inde pendent, which reported a loss of-SKrl20m for the first four months of 1991, follows its suc cess in reducing lending vol ume from SKrl9.4bn to around SKr5bn. The sale of its credit card subsidiary, Finax, accounted or most of this reduction. The new credit package follows SKr6bn in short-term loans eceived last spring.

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto CHARBONNAGES de France has filed a CS42m (US386.m) claim in a Vancouver court against an international con- sortium of banks, alleging that one of them. Cr'dit Lyonnais, misled Charbonnages over an investment in the ailing Quin- tette coal mine in British Columbia. The claim is attracting wide. spread interest in international banking and legal circles. Both Charbonnages and Crddit Lyonnais are controlled by the French government, and the case raises questions about financial guarantees offered by a state-owned institution which later finds itself at log- gerheads with another public- sector entity. The claim underlines risks faced by Credit Lyonnais and its chief executive, Mr Bernard Thiolon, in taking on the dual role of lender and financial adviser in a transaction. In a statement filed with the British Columbia Supreme Court, Charbonnages accuses the bank of a conflict of inter- est in acting both as a lender to Quintette and an adviser to Charbonnages on the financial viability of the mine. Quintette, which is North America's largest single exporter of metallurgical coal, was built in the early 1980s to diversify Japanese steelma- nernara Tanoion: anal role of lender and adviser kers' sources of raw material supplies. But the mine has been plagued almost since its inception by financial prob- lems caused by sagging coal prices, as well as high produc- tion and transport costs. A dispute with its customers over prices culminated in a court order in June 1990 freez- ing the mine's financial obliga- tions. Charbonnages says in its claim that Crddit Lyonnais failed, among other things, to advise it on the terms of the mine's contracts with Japanese steel mills and the risks inher- ent in these contracts, espe- dally provisions allowing for changes in the coal price. It says that it would not have provided Afnancial back- ing for the C1libn project had it been advised ofthe risks to Quintette's long-term viability. Chrbonnages has a 12 per cent equty stake in Quintette, and has also provided a US09.4m guarantee to the 56- member lender consortium. Its claim is part of the French company's defence against a suit launched by the banks, led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Mon- treal, seeking to enforce its guarantee. The banks have yet to file their response to Char- bonnages' claim. Quintette's other sharehold- ers, which include 12 Japanese steel companies and Denison Mines, honoured their guaran- tees to the banks in 1986. Quintette itself continued to service Charbonnages' portion of the debt until the mine was brought under the protection of the courts last year. The mine is currently in the throes of negotiations to restructure its CS$40m debt as well as other liabilities. After a series of disputes involving Denison, the steel mills and the banks, responsi- bility for managing the mine was recently transferred from Denison to Teck of Vancouver.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney DOMINION Mining, the Perth- based gold mining company, yesterday announced a net loss of A$27m (US$21.3m) for the year to the end of June, after writing down the value of its gold reserves by A$81m. Dominion said the write- down had been necessary because of the low price of gold and the introduction of corpo- rate taxation on Australian gold production from last year. The effect of the write-down was reduced by a tax credit of A$17m reflecting deductible expenditure allowed as part of the regime for the introduction of the gold tax. Dominion said it would be accounting for tax in the current year, but expec ted not to be liable for tax pay ments until the 1993-94 sinan- cial year. The directors said pre-tax profit was virtually steady at A$35m on revenue up from A$227m to AM243m. The board declared an unfranked final dividend of 2 cents a share, making a total dividend of 4.5 cents, compared with 4 cents last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Matiln Dickson SALOMON BROTHERS, the US securities house, said yes- terday that it had been forced to reduce substantially its holdings of securities as a result of the scandal over its rigging of US Treasury bond market auctions. The cuts, which Salomon did not quantify, were foreshad- owed some weeks ago when it indicated it would be shrinking its balance sheet. They could mean a significant reduction in its trading activities and reve- nues, for Wall Street securities houses require large invento- ries of securities to sell on to their clients. The group has already been hit by the defection of several leading clients, and there is evidence that its share of new US stock and bond underwrit- ings has fallen off sharply since the scandal broke in early August. However, a spokesman for Salomon said yesterday that its liquidity remained very strong and its flow of business from custom- ers good. The firm has shrunk its bal- ance sheet, which stood at $134bn on June 30, to an esti- mated $121bn on September 6 and the reduction process is still continuing. In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Com- mission, Salomon noted that the continuing government investigation into its trading activities, together with a rcent decision by rating agen- cies to downgrade its debt, had hurt its ability to borrow on an unsecured basis in the com- mercial paper market, as well as in other markets. It said it had taken several steps to shift its funding sources and reduce assets in order to maintain liquidity, and it was \"making substantial reductions in securities posi- tions and adjusting their com- position to reduce the need for unsecured funding.\" The firm had $8.4bn of com- mercial paper outstanding at the end of June, but this is now down to $3.8bn and is expected to be further reduced. It said that as outstanding commercial paper and other unsecured borrowings were retired, it was replacing them with additional secured bor- rowings and repurchase agree- ments - which continued to be its principal sources of funds - as well as other types of unsecured borrowings. Repurchase agreements involve a firm raising short-term funds by lending out securities which it later buys back. The Salomon spokesman declined to comment on reports that the group had asked Morgan Guaranty Trust to arrange a new, multi-billion dollar committed bank loan, secured by government paper, to replace some of its commer- cial paper borrowings. Separately, Mr Warren Bus- sett, Salomon's new chairman, late last week met 110 lending banks to brief them on the group's position and seek to allay concern about their expo- sure to the firm's multi-billion dollar credit lines."

The company said its flagship portable 3730 mode weighed only 12.7 ounces and included a display screen with a built-in user guide, a 200-number memory and up to 70 minutes of talk time. Model prices are not yet available. The company also noted its consumer products and phone centres would provide cellular customers with technical assistance and replacements, sometimes within the hour. N The three top executives or Pan Am would step down under a plan being presented today to the judge overseeing Pan Am's bankruptcy case, a spokesman said last night. HIe would not comment, however, on a US newspaper report indicating that the job of running the smaller, reorganised Pan Am was likely to go to Mr Randall Marlin, USAir's executive vice- president of marketing. The Pan Am managers expected to resign are the chairman and chief executive, Mr Thomas Plaskett, the chief financial officer, Mr Richard Francis, and the chief operating officer, Mr Peter icHugh. @Equimark said its board of directors had approved a rights offering to common shareholders that was expected to raise $30m. The bank holding company said it would hold a special meeting of stockholders on November 26 to seek approval for the offering. SThe New York City Department of Consumer Affairs said it had reached a settlement with Procter & Gamble, Revlon, Tetrapak, Icelandic Marketing and Combibloc on the department's charges of environmental deception. In March the department sued the five companies charging they had engaged in deceptive environmental advertising. Terms of the settlement are to be announced later. S*UAL's $72m bid for Air Wis Services, announced late on Tuesday, would give United Airlines precious landing slots at Chicago's O'Hare airport but the low price may not satisfy Air Wis shareholders. UAL said it had agreed to buy Air Wis, the parent of commuter carrier Air Wisconsin, which flies to 33 cities. Under the stock swap and cash deal, at least 81 per cent of Air Wis stock would be converted into UAL common at $7.81 a share as of Tuesday's close. The remaining 19 per cent would be exchanged for cash at $9 a share, with the merger giving United Airlines control of Air Wisconsin's 50 jet landing and take-off slots and its 119 commuter slots at O'Hare.

   "text_content" : "By Stiamn Waghtyl in Tokyo BANK OF TOKYO, a leading Japanese bank, has finally found a home for one of its oldest problem debtors, Yuasa Trading, a trading company which first ran into financial difficulties more than a decade ago. In a deal put together by the bank and announced yester- day, Yuasa Trading is to be taken over by Yuasa Shoji, a much larger and conspicuously more successful trading group. The two companies will be merged into a new company in which each 100 Yuasa Trading shares will be valued at 36 shares in Yuasa Shoji. The two companies share the same name, but have no capi- tal or business ties. Yuasa Trading specialises in the tim- ber and food trades, while Yuasa Shoji deals in machin- ery and in the domestic distribution of building materi- als. Yuasa Trading, a loose afflli- ate of the Bank of Tokyo which holds a 5 per cent stake, was hit by the violent swings in commodity prices in the late 9tl0s and early 1980s. It tried to diversify from its traditional businesses into trading machinery and electronics products but generated insuffi- dent profit from its new activi- ties. It was kept afloat in the late 1960s by gains from securi- ties dealings which offset poor operating results. Yuasa Trading has not paid a dividend since 1980. In the four years to March 1990, it lost Y4.7bn ($35.2m) at the operat- ing level although it broke even at the pre-tax level. In the last financial year, to the end of March 1991, it made a small operating profit of Y325m and a pre-tax profit of Y206m. An official declined to elabo- rate on the company's perfor- mance, and said: \"Please don't write that we made losses all those years. Last year we finally made a profit.\" Yuasa Shoji said it hoped to benefit from Yuasa Trading' experience in China and the Soviet Union. Merging the two companies would achieve econ- omies of scale. Mr Kenichi Furumi, presi- dent of Yuasa Trading, said the merger had been agreed after a long slump at his company. The two companies would com- plement each other. Yuasa Trading had sales of Y156bn in the year to March and Yuasa Shoji Y474bn.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown BURNS PHILP, the diversified Australian food and trading group, yesterday blamed the effects of recession on its hardware division for a 15 per cent fall in net profits to A$90m (US$72m) for the year to the end of June. Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, said there were early signs of a turn- round in the building industry, but the improvement was unlikely to have much impact on the hardware business in the short term. \"Unless there is a substan- lial increase in building activ- ity in Australia in the near future, it is unlikely that there will be a significant improve- ment in the level of profitabil- ity for the group in the coming year,\" Mr Turnbull said. The group said it had made \"solid progress\" towards its strategic goal of realigning activities into its core food and hardware operations. The group made a pre-tax profit of A$117m during the year on the sale of a 45 per cent stake in QBE Insurance for A$317m. The sale helped reduce net debt to A0257m from AS526m, placing the company in \"an excellent financial position,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"We now have almost three- quarters of our assets concen- trated in food and hardware, and we have substantial sur- pluses available for further development as conditions improve,\" he said. However, expansion would occur \"only in our clearly- defined core activities, and only if targets meet our strict inancial criteria\". The group said the biggest cause of the fall in profits had been a 31 per cent cut in net urofits from the hardware divi- sion, which contributed A$2im. The food and fermentation division increased profits by 12 per cent to A$65m, and the Pacific trading division increased profits marginally rom A$14m to A$15m. Turn- over was up 6 per cent to A$2.3bn. Buns Philp said net profits had increased to A$179m after aking account of extraordi- nary profits of A$117m on the ale of QBE, and extraordinary and abnormal losses of A$28m. The losses were related to a plant rationalisation and Burns' involvement with Estate Mortgage Trust."

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong JARDINE MATHESON, the Hong Kong-based trading group, has acted to stifle criti- cism of its planned move of primary listing to London by making a significant gesture on the Hong Kong takeover code. This may also increase the company's chances of a compromise with Hong Kong regulators now consulting the public about Jardine's plans. Mr Nigel Rich, managing director, said yesterday the company now agreed that if it moved its primary listing to London it would remain sub- ject to Hong Kong's takeover code. \"This is a significant step which we hope will meet the concerns which have been expressed,\" he said. Jardine announced last year it wanted London to be its pri- mary regulator due to fears China would interfere in Hong Kong after 1997. The company wants Hong Kong regulators to create a new, trading-only sta- tus for large companies in the colony. This would allow its shares to continue to be traded in Hong Kong, where Jardine group companies account for about 9 per cent of capitalisa- tion. But because Jardine is domi- ciled in Bermuda, it is not cov- ered by the London takeover code, and the company has been accused of trying to escape from takeover regula- tions. An earlier suggestion by Jardine to remain subject to the Hong Kong code for a three-year transition period failed to silence the criticism. Jardine has also been attacked by China for seeking \"special favours\" ahead of 1997. The stock exchange and Secu- rities and Futures Commission, the overall market watchdog, will not decide on the issue pending public consultations, which could last the rest of the year. Jardine has warned that if it is not granted a trading-only status it will delist from Hong Kong. Jardine's new proposal relies on trading-only status companies still being able to delist if they agree to come under the Hong Kong takeover code. Mr Rich said the company was concerned about the impli- cations under the takeover code for trading-only status companies who decide to delist. \"It is important the rela- tionship of our listing in Hong Kong is on clear-cut terms so that, if we have to, we can sever that relationship,\" he said. Mr Rich was speaking after Jardine announced a 10 per cent increase in net profits for the six months to the end of June of USS1a5i.m. Turnover increased 38 per cent to 0abnm and the com- pay Is raisin its Interim divi- dd 8 r cent to 34 cent a share. The results were in line writh epectations.",

   "text_content" : "RUSTENBURG PLATINUM HOLDINGS LIMITED and its wholly owned subsidiaries (\"RPH\") (Registration number 05/22452/06) |LEBOWA PLATINUM MINES LIMITED (\"LEBOWAPLATS\") (Registration number 63/06144/06) POTGIETERSRUST PLATINUMS LIMITED (\"PP RUST\") , ,. (Registration number 01/08353/06) (All companies are incorporated in the Republic of South Africa) ANNOUNCEMENT AND NOTICE OF LAST DATE TO REGISTER A rights offer by PP Rust to RPH and Lebowa Plats; a renunciation by Lebowa Plats to its members of its entitlements under the rights offer and a distribution by RPH to its members of its 21,54% interest in Lebowa Plats and its rights to be issued fully paid shares in PP Rust as a dividend in specie. Shareholders were advised in an announcement dated 25 July 1991 that PP Rust, equally owned by RPH and Lebowa Plats, intends to raise approximately R400 million by way of a rights offer and, in due course, the balance of its total capital requirements through debt to fund the development of an open cast mine with an initial production rate of 200000 tonnes per month on certain farms on the Platreef. The estimated capital expenditure for the mine has been revised downwards to R600 million in escalated money terms since the abovementioned announcement Notwithstanding the current level of platinum group metal prices, your directors have resolved to proceed with the development of the PP Rust mine. The expected low cost structure of the mine should ensure its competitiveness in the industry. On 12 September 1991 a flotation agreement was signed by RPH, Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (\"RPM\"), Lebowa Plats and PP Rust which includes, inter alia, the following provisions: 1. PP Rust shall raise approximately R400 million by way of a rights offer of 120000000 ordinary shares of 2,5 cents each to its two equal shareholders, namely RPH and Lebowa Flats, in proportion to their holdings, at a subscription price of R3,33 per share. Application will be made to The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (\"JSE\") and the London Stock Exchange (\"LSE\") for the listing ofPP Rust ordinary shares. The purpose of the rights offer will be to raise hinds to enable PP Rust to finance the development of the PP Rust open cast platinum mine, which will include the cost of the feasibility study and trial mining financed by RPM. 2. Lebowa Plats shall renounce to its shareholders, registered as such on the record date, its entitlement to 60000 000 ordinary shares in PP Rust under the PP Rust rights offer in the ratio of 50 PP Rust shares for every 100 shares held in Lebowa Plats, at a subscription price of R3,33 per PP Rust share. 3 RPH shall distribute to its shareholders, registered as such on the record date, as a dividend in specie - 25064086 shares in Lebowa Plats (ex PPRust entitlements under the rights offer) on the basis of 20 ordinary shares in Lebowa Plats for every 100 shares heldin RPHand - 72685849 rights to be issued fully paid shares in PP Rust (\"PP Rust rights), accruing to RPH by virtue of its direct and indirect interests in PP Rust, on the basis of 58 PP Rust rights for every 100 shares held in RPH. The balance of the 778118 Lebowa Plats shares, 235252 PP Rust rights and its existing 132312 shares in PP Rust wil be sold for the benefit of RPH. The directors of Lebowa Plats have concluded that despite the company's need for equity finance to fund a portion of the capital expenditure associated with its expansion plans, the short term forecast of the company's cash flow and its borrowing facilities are sufficient to enable the rights issue to be deferred. The PP Rust rights offer will have no effect on the earnings of Lebowa Plats' current operations. In the case of RPH, the company's future earnings will be marginally reduced by the opportunity cost of the cash outlay needed to fund the dividend in specie. PP Rust shares will not be registered with The Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington D.C., or the Ontario Securities Commission and, accordingly, the Lebowa Plats renunciation will not be made to persons with registered addresses in the United States of America or its territories or Canada. The entitlements will be sold for the benefit of such shareholders and remittance will only be made to such shareholders where the net proceeds exceed R5,00; where the proceeds are less than R5,00 such proceeds will be retained for the benefit of RPH. The PP Rust rights offer, Lebowa Plats renunciation and the RPH dividend in specie are subject to the JSE granting a listing of - 120264625sharesinPPRustand - 60 000 000 renounceable (nil paid) letters of allocation in PP Rust. The declaration of the RPH dividend in specie referred to above is further subject to the passing, at a General Meeting of RPH shareholders to be held on -20 September 1991, of a Special Resolution amending Article 107 of the company's Articles of Association, and the subsequent registration thereof by the Registrar of Companies. Members of Lebowa Plats and RPH who are registered as such on 4 October 1991 will be entitled to participate in the PP Rust rights offer and the RPH dividend in specie respectively Accordingly, the share registers of the two companies will be closed from 7 October 1991 to 11 October 1991, both days inclusive. The circular containing the details of the PP Rust rights offer and Lebowa Platp renunciation, which includes a pre-stn statement, is being finalised and will, subject to the rules, requirements and procedures of the JSE and LSE, be posted, together with the renounceable (nil paid) letters of alocation, to members of Lebowa Plats on 11 October 1991. A dividend in specie circular, explaining the transaction, together with the above mentioned circular, will be posted to RPH shareholders on the same date.

Trading was exce tnally quiet, with a number of players absent to mark the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. In late trading, the, Trea wary's benchmark 80year bond was * lower at 102t, yielding 7.2 per cent after posting slim gains in the early afternoon. The long bond's movements were exaggerated by the thinr ness of the market. Shorter dated maturities were unchanged to * lower. Thne Federal Reserve entered he open market to execute overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 5% per cent. The adding operation was seen as a technical move to address he rate's firmness. The day opened with reports hat the US was preparing for an attack on Iraq if Saddam GOVERNMENT ONDS Hussein, the Iraqi president, did not allow complete inspec- ion of his country's weapon sites. Later in the morning, the United Nations said failure by Baghdad to co-operate might lead to military action. In the afternoon, the Trea- sury said it planned to raise 4.20bn in new cash through he sale of a record $13bn of two-year notes on Tuesday and the sale of $9.25bn of five- year notes on Wednesday. a PRICES in the UK gilts mar- ket rose sharply, despite a weaker showing for the ruling Conservative party in the lat- est opinion poll. The poll suggested that the Conservative government and the opposition Labour party are level-pegging, contradicting recent polls which showed the Conservatives well ahead. But the market failed to react to the poll, focusing instead on the details of next week's gilt auction, announced on Tuesday. The new paper will mature in 2004, rather than in the 2008 area which many dealers had expected. Consequently, the long-dated sector of the gilts market bene- sited yesterday. Investors who had been waiting to switch into the new stock, in order to hold long-dated paper, bought the long end of the market. Long-dated gilts ended % point up on the day. Shorter-dated bonds posted smaller gains. * GERMAN bund prices ended slightly lower, after reports of US military movements in the Gulf and news that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is suffering from heart trouble. The French government bond market registered little reaction to the 1992 budget, which contained few surprises. Prices were virtually unchanged. Japanese government bonds were steady in trading hours, with the No. 129 benchmark ending at 6.11 per cent. Prices were unchanged in European trading."

   "text_content" : "By Damlan Fraser in Havana CUBA, facing an end to Soviet aid worth $2bn a year, is will- ing to discuss debt-equity swaps with foreign creditors in order to help reduce its $7bn of debt to the west. \"This is an idea we can dis- cuss on a case-by-case basis,\" said Mr Raul Amado Blanco, vice-president of the National Bank of Cuba. He said that while Cuba had had conversations with credi- tors. oin debt-equity. swaps, there had as yet been no con- crete proposals. But, he added, \"technically it is something we can consider\". In the past couple of years, Cuba has been promoting for- eign investment in tourism, and lately in light industry and bio-technology. Grupo Sol, the Spanish hotel group, is spend- ing $150m in a joint venture with the Cuban government, building three hotels in the Veradero beach resort. Mr Blanco reaffirmed that Cuba would not start meeting debt and interest payments - suspended since 1986 - unless the country received fresh \"The debt problem has to be resolved,\" he said, \"using the same formula applied in other places in western and eastern Europe.\" He suggested that Cuba had been discriminated against for political reasons. \"If there is no goodwill from other countries, we cannot pay,\" he said. Cuba is also thought to owe more than $lObn to the Soviet Union. Talks on this and other commercial arrangements between the two countries are likely to start soon. In the past few months, spec- ulative buyers have emerged for Cuban debt to foreign banks,. Tis J has. pushed the price of this debt up to about 5 cents on the dollar from 2 cents some months ago, although bankers in London say deals are still relatively rare.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong HONG KONG's stock exchange yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Paul Chow, a computer expert, as chief executive to replace Mr Francis Yuen, who is leaving. Mr Chow was favourite for the job because of his technological experience as Hong Kong upgrades the exchange's systems and moves towards scripless trading. He is currently chief executive of the Hong Kong securities clearing committee and has overseen the establishment of the market's central clearing operations which are due to begin later this year. Mr Chow, 44, worked for Sun Hung Kai, one of the largest Hong Kong stockbrokers, for 15 years before joining the exchange as director of operation services in 1989. Mr Chow will take over at a difficult time. The exchange is being forced to reform by the overall market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, and this has angered many small Chinese brokers who fear their power base within the exchange is being eroded. Mr Chow will have to reconcile this group of small brokers with large international brokers, who are set to gain greater influence once the reforms are in place at the start of next year. The exchange's relationship with the SFC has also been strained. Mr Yuen announced his resignation earlier this month and is leaving to become chiel executive of Hang Chong, a large trading group being taken over by a consortium led by Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of China International Trust and Investment Corporation, China's main overseas investment vehicle. Mr Yuen was the first professional manager brought into the exchang,e and his appointment was one ol several changes introduced after the chairmanship of Mr Ronald Li designed to improve the exchanoe's, image and \"levels of professionalism.",

   "text_content" : "By Katiharine Campbell in Frankfurt HAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, one of the two big Bavarian banks, is raising DM522.6m in its second rights issue this year. In the spring of this year it sought DM445.5m in new equity from shareholders. The latest issue is being made on a one-for-10 basis, at DM330 each. A total of 73.83m ardinary shares, together with 5.35m non-voting preferred shares, will be created. While other finandcial insti- titions have opted to issue various forms of Genus- scheine, or participating certif- icates, which are cheaper if the share price is underper- forming, the Bavarians are apparently happy with the market's valuation of their hares. The bank said that the rapid expansion in overall business experienced in the first six months of the year had contin- ued over the summer. In the east of Germany, Vereinsbank expects to make a profit this year, sooner than expected, as has been the case with other banks. It now has a network of over 44 branches -Mss the Elbe, looking after 110,000 customers and 164,000 accounts. It has taken in deposits in excess of DMS.lbn; credits amounting to DM5.Sbn have been approved, of which D l.Tbm has been paid out.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London NEW issue activity was subdued yesterday with few borrowers prepared to launch new issues after the recent run of large deals in the Ecu and Canadian dollar sectors. Expec- tations of supply in dollars before the end ps the week also held the primary market in check. INTERNATIONAL BONDS The World Bank is expected to launch its $1.5bn global bond issue soon, possibly today, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston and Gold- man Sachs. Syndicate manag- ers are expecting a five-year issue, probably priced just inside the European Invest- ment Bank's recent $300ft five- year Eurobond issue. The EIB deal was trading yesterday at a yield spread of 21 basis points over US Treasury bonds. Demand from dollar-based investors is expected to be trong. However, many Euro- pean and Far Eastern accounts regard the US currency as due or a period of downward cor- rection and are not strong buy- ers of dollar bonds. Yesterday, AB Electrolux, the Swedish consumer elec- tronics group, launched a $100m five-year issue, lead- managed by Merrill LyncL nternational. The bonds carry a coupon of 8% per cent and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.75, where the yield spread over US govern- mient bonds is 110 basis points. Participants in the deal reported strong retail-led demand for the paper, with buvers attracted by the gener ous yield and the familiar name of the borrower. The Australian dollar sector if the market saw its fourth ssue inside a week, following a fun month without new sup- ply. Yesterday, South Austra Ua came with a A$100m 10-year ssue, lead-managed by Hambros. The bonds pay a coupon of 11% per cent and were priced at 11 , where the yield is 11.60. This offers a pilk-up of 20 basis points over the Com- monwealth bank of Australia's 10-year deal launched through Deutsche Bank on Monday. The deal traded at less 1.95 bid, inside full fees of 2.125 per cent. In the secondary market, Finland's EcuS5Om 10-year issue, launched on Tuesday via J.P. Morgan Securities, contin- ued to suffer and traded down to 99.88 bid from a fixed reoffer price of 99.25, outside of full fees 32.5 basis points. Seasoned benchmarks such as the UK government's 10-year Ecu bond issue also lost around 10 basis points during the day. Hydro Quebec's C$1.lbn global bond issue was priced with a 10% per cent coupon and was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.485. The bonds traded at around this level throughout the day.",

   "text_content" : "SPAIN'S financial futures market will introduce its first currency contracts tomorrow, based on peseta-dollar and peseta-D-Mark trading, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. Contracts will be settled on a cash basis with the value of transfers determined on the second business day prior to the third Wednesday of the month in which the contract expires. Delivery will occur four times over the year, in Dece*n ber, March, June and Septem- ber. \"There's no tradition in Spain for sophisticated cur- rency speculation, so it's diffi- cult to predict the volume of contracts we'll move,\" said one trader. \"But we're optimistic we'll trade a minimum of 1,000 contracts a day.\" The Madrid futures market was founded last year with a capital of Ptal.5bn. It has 45 members, primarily from Spain's largest commercial and savings oanxs. Currently, the market trades 90-day contracts for three- and five-year Treasury bonds with daily trading volume stands at around 3,500 contracts. * The Amsterdam Financial Futures Market (FTA) is to launch a dollar futures con- tract on September 27, Renter reports from Amsterdam. The contracts will have an underlying value of $25,000, but prices will be quoted in guil- ders.",

   "article_dc_title" : "The Heat is on for Italian Bond Futures",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "I TER T in Italan bond futures is surpassing all expectations as the Italian government bond market roars ahead. The first Italian bond futures contract, launched two weeks ago by the Matif, the Paris- based exchange, has already attracted a large portion of business. Average daily vol- ume so far exceeds 8,000 con- tracts, and open interest stood at 7,600 contracts (as at Sep- tember 17). So the London International Financial Futures Exchange, which launches its own Italian bond futures contract today, has some ground to make up. Dealers say the Matif con- tract has spurred trading activ- ity in Italian bonds. The exist- ing cash market in Italian bonds is liquid. But it is expen- sive to take short positions. The advent of a futures mar- ket resolves these problems. So far, much of the heavy volume of futures business on the Matif has been attributed to inter-dealer activity (rather than buying by institutional investors). The launch of the two futures contracts has proved timely. Changes to the system for obtaining withholding tax refunds on Italian bonds, announced in late April, have taken three months to bear riiuit. But investors' once-shaky faith in the new system has grown. Many analysts believe that at some stage Italy will have to fall in line with other European markets by paying interest gross to non-resident investors. Further, the issue of Euro- psan economic convergence, which faded during the sum- mer, has reappeared, and investors in high-yielding Ital- ian bonds stand to be among the greatest beneficiaries, as Italian interest rates fall towards the European mean.. Many analysts say that, con- sidering the market's pros- Uects, Italian bonds still look remarkably cheap. Long-term bond yields are around 13 per cent gross - the highest yields available in any large, actively traded market. Nomura Research expects net yields to fall from 11.3 per cent to 9 per cent by the end of 1992. The inflation level of 6 per cent is projected to fall to around 5% per cent this year. For the time being, the bulk of interest in the market has been from European investors. Since the lira entered the nar- row band of the Exchange Rate riechanism early in 1990, cur- rency risk for European inves tors is low. However, there has PIlrc also been some interest from US investors seeking high yielding bond investments, now that the US junk bond market is defunct. Japanese investors appear to be lagging. A s the Matif and Liffe contracts get under way, the Italian author- ities are planning their own contract, although this is likely to be so far behind the other two, that, even if Italian banks are persuaded to use it, it will be hard to compete with two proven exchanges. In any case, three contracts for one government bond mar- ket is impractical. Even given the strong level of demand for the product, most analysts agree that two contracts are unlikely to survive. \"There is not really room for two con- tracts, and if one starts to become illiquid, it will be fin- ished,\" said one futu-es trader. However, at the outset, the differences in contract specifi- cations, particularly the under-. lying bonds, are likely to cre- ate arbitrage opportunities between the two contracts. \"It's hard to choose between them. Liffe and the Matif are both very efficient, and their fees are very similar,\" one trader said. However, some traders say the longer maturity of deliverable bonds in the Liffe contract (8-10'/s years, compared with 6-10 years) will favour speculative trading. In addition, a large propor- tion of trading is conducted in London. Total turnover in BTPs (Buoni del Tesoro Polien- nali) - the long-term fixed-rate bonds which are the underly- ing instruments for both con- tracts - is more than L6,000bn daily, around 40 per cent through London. * The Matif said yesterday that the 12 per cent BTP, due September 1998, will be in the long term bond pool for the March and June 1992 delivery month. The Italian Treasury launched the L2,500bn issue on September 16. The Matif is also to extend open outcry hours for its long-term interest rate con- tracts. From today, closing will be 4.30pm local time instead of 4pm.",

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb KUWAIT is understood to be discussing a $500m short-term credit facility with Citibank to help cover the cost of recon- struction in the wake of the Gulf war. It is estimated that the cost of rebuilding Kuwait could run to between $20bn and $30bn. As a result, Kuwait is expected to borrow heavily in the international capital mar kets. Hanking sources said the Kuwaiti authorities have been in negotiations with Citibank; but Citibank refused to com- ment. The sources said that Kuwait has raised some short-term fin ancing since the end of the Gulf war. It is understood to have sold about $lbn of its assets, including bonds, shares and commercial paper held in the main financial centres, and has also arranged short-term funding in the form of repur- chase agreements. However, many bankers expect Kuwait to borrow between $Ibn and $2bn in the syndicated loan market soon. Several leading banks have held discussions with the Kuwaiti authorities about the possibility of arranging a large syndicated credit. Kuwait is keen to borrow in the international capital mar- kets as cheaply as possible without having to use any of its assets as collateral. J. P. Morgan recently arranged a three-year $4.5bn syndicated loan for Saudi Arabia at a margin of % point over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). However, bankers argue that Kuwait is unlikely to be able to borrow as cheaply as Saudi Arabia. Under the Basle inter- national capital adequacy rules - which stipulate that banks set aside varying amounts of capital when they make loans according to the status of the borrower - Kuwait has a full risk weighting whereas Saudi Arabia is zero-rated. * Standard Chartered, the UK bank, is launching a new division to unify its approach to financial services world- wide, Renter reports. The division, Standard Char- tered Equitor Group, formerly known as Chartered Financial Holdings, would bring together custody, private banking, asset management and trustee ser- vices, it said in a statement. Mr Michael Brogan, new Equitor managing director, said he expected it to provide \"real revenue growth\" for Standard Chartered. Equitor would be based in Hong Kong with operations in 16 countries.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London NATIONAL Westminster Bank has increased the size of its US preference shares issue from $200m to $250m, a move which will encourage other European banks hoping to raise capital in the US market. The issue was also priced yesterday to pay an annual dividend rate of 10.64 per cent, a lower cost of capital than achieved by other UK banks in the US market. The issue was launched last week through a syndicate of banks led by Merrill Lynch, and has been placed with both retail and institutional inves- tors. The non-cumulative, perpet- ual preference shares count as core or Tier I capital for the bank under the Basle guide- lines on international bank capital adequacy, increasing the bank's capacity to lend. The issue is National West- minster's first issue of US pref- erence shares although other UK banks have been active in the market this year. In March, Barclays made a $200m issue, which currently yields just under 11 per cent, bringing its total outstanding dollar preference capital to nearly $lbn. Last month, Royal Bank of Scotland made a $200m issue. Banco Santander recently became the first continental European bank to tap this important valuable source of core capital. * Banco Bilbao Vizcaya has introduced four peseta-denomi- nated investment funds offer- ing fiscal incentives for inves- tors under the new Spanish income tax law.",

   "text_content" : "By Enrique Tessler in Helsinki OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish state-owned base metals group, and Western Mining of Austra- lia, the western world's third largest nickel producer, have agreed to develop the Mt Keith nickel project in Western Australia as a 50:50 joint venture. The announcement follows weeks of battle between the two for control of Mt Keith. Last Monday, Western Min- ing and Normandy Poseidon said that its A$l.11 a share bid was unconditional and would expire on October 23. On the same day ASP, a Monaco-based group which owns 37 per cent of Australian Consolidated Metals, the original partner in the Mt Keith project with Outokumpu, had accepted the offer. Mr Risto Virrankoski, presi- dat of Outokumpu Metals & Resources International, said he was \"satisfied with the eal\" and expected that the ther institutional investors of ACM would most likely end up ccepting Western Mining's bid. Nickel production from Mt Keith should have started last pring but new ore tests revealed a higher level of mag- esia than showed up previ- usly. Last July, and after new :sts, Outokumpu announced that the magnesia problem was \"manageable\". Production at Mt Keith was also stalled by Western Mining and Normandy Poseidon's attempt to gain control over the mine. Mr Virrankoski said that all these events have put production at Mt Keith \"a half a year behind schedule\" for Outokumpu. Outokumpu had planned originally to purchase 18,000 tonnes of nickel concentrate annually to feed its Hairjavalta plant in western Finland but this will now drop to 14,000 tonnes, or half of the concen- trate the mine will produce each year.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By a Special Correspondent OMAN, one of the smallest oil producers in the Middle East, is to increase its natural gas exploitation substantially fol- lowing the signing this week of a seven-year exploration agree- ment with Bermuda-based Transworld Oil. Under the deal announced in Salalah by Mr Said bin Ahmed al-Shanfari, the Omani Minis- ter of Petroleum and Minerals, the company will be allowed to test drill and survey the Haffar concession area in the southern desert region of Dho- far. The concession once belonged to Amoco. The Omani government regards gas as an important diversification away from oil which currently accounts for 80 per cent of state revenue. The country's crude reserves are estimated at only 4.3bn proven barrels. At the present production rate of 70,000 barrels a day it is forecast that output will one to a halt in 15-25 years. Explora- tion and extraction is also expensive in Oman's desert and mountainous environment on the southern edge of the Arabian peninsula. Present gas reserves are esti- mated at 9.8 trillion (million million) cubic feet, of which,7.1 trillion cf are not associated with oil deposits. The largest reserves are located at Yibal, 300 km (185 miles) south of Muscat, the capital, where shallow gas fields are estimated to have a potential yield of between 4-5 trillion cf. This year there have been significant discoveries near Ghaba in central Oman, at depths between 4,500 and 5,000 feet, and in Sih Raul in the Wusta region, 320 km south of Muscat. The latter was much deeper than normal - between 14,625 and 16,250 ft - indicating \"clear and highly encouraging implications for the future\". said Mr Shanfari. Oman is committed to repla- cing valuable fuel oil with nat- ural gas as a principle energy source. Present reserves are capable of meeting projected demand to the year 2015, says the ministry. Desalination plants supply- ing Muscat with drinking water are powered by gas and so is the power for the light industrial area near the capi- tal. There are also plans to expand the national power grid with a widening network of rural gas power stations to replace the small diesel gener- ating systems now serving iso- lated communities in the des- ert.",

But traders said gold was meeting resistance as it approached to $350 level, the breach of which early last week appeared to be the signal for a fresh wave of Middle East selling. At the London Metal Exchange the copper market bounced following the falls on Monday and Tuesday to close Â£17 up at Â£1,326.50 a tonne. Traders said an early decline was reversed after the appearance of Japanese buying interest together with trade and speculative demand. But they expected resistance to be revealed by any further advance.

   "text_content" : "ly Violora Grltlh in Suo Paulo TEHE GOVERNMENT of the -Amalzaln state of. Pmi-Al has. decided to re-open Bo Fptauro one of the largest ti minas in the wrld, after 5000 unemployed miners marched in protest n front of the gov naor's palace. Mr Oswaldo Plans Filho, governor of Rdondoia, ordered the closure of the mine in August, because of the miners' aged disregard for the envi- onment and susected links with drag traricking. The miners were forcibly evicted from the site by the federal Ponce. Re-opening of Bom Future to the self-employed tin miners carries some conditions, how- ever. According to Mr Benaldo Soaeiro, director of the Rondon- Ian secretariat for ecological development, the mine will now be kept under constant vigilance by the state's envi- ronmental agencies, the fed- eral police, and the state reve- nue service. The decision to let the min- ers return was based on the economic hardship caused in \"he state by Bom Futuro's clo- sure. Although the mine only employs about 5,000 miners, it ndirectly sustains many local ndustries. \"The state has suffered a subDstantial drop in tax receipts due to the mine's do- sure,\" said Mr Soeiro, adding 'hat in the towns' nearest the mine tax collections had fallen by up to 70 per cent. The small-time miners' work n Bom Futuro still depends, however, on the outcome of their legal battle with the Nbesa mining company over rights to the area. For almost our years, the Rondonian miners' union has been fight- ng in court with this concern, which is owned by the mineral giant Paranapanema. A fed- eral judge in Brasilia is expec- ted to make a ruling on the ituation later this month. \"The opening of the mine is ai rovisional measure to ease some of the economic troubles n the area,\" said Mr Soeiro \"If the miners continue to iestroy the environment, or if :::e suspect that miners are laundering drug money the government will close down Bom Futuro again immedi- ately,\" he explained. 0 News that the Brazilian authorities expected tir exports this year to fall to 25000 tonnes from the 1990 evel of 30,500 tonnes had lit- te market impact yesterday. Nor did the Bom Futuro deci- sion appear to have influenced raders. The London Metal Exehange price for cash deliv- ry closed unchanged at $5,56e a tonne, having recovered from an early fall.",

   "text_content" : "By Kemel QGooding, Mining Correspondent IRON ORB contract negotiations will be particu- laiiy touh this .year and the 'Japanese consmners might presis price cut from their tralian upi anoalyssw steel are already unter pres- sue and likely to be 1a9geed. at least until the -atd'o this year. In s contrast, iron ore prices are among the very few which have remained high despite the recesion in most of the industrialised world. Aus- tralian producers won increases of 7 per cent last year and 17 per cent in 1969. u\"ie risk is high that the extraordinarily good conditions for Australian iron ore produc- ers are about to fade,\" says the resources research team at Burdett, Buckeridge & Young, the Australian stockbroker. MrAndrew Cooke, analyst at James Capel Australia, says: \"Signs are emerging that sug- gest Australian iron ore pro- ducen will enter rice nesotia tlons at a time when stae pro- ducers are onganxouly the bottom lines of theirb ance sheets. Steel prices are not likely to rebound in the second and it therefore seems unlikely that producers, both in Jspan and elsewhere, will be willing to sacrifice already low or negative mar- gins by paying more for iron ore.\" Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist for the RTZ Corpo- ration, the world's largest min- ing company which accounts for about 8 per cent of world iron ore output, says he expects Japanese and German steel producers to press for a reduction in iron ore prices as an opening ploy in negotia- tions. However, it is more likely that the iron ore producers will win a small price rise, one below the rate of inflation, he suggests. The Burdett Buckeridge te-a says a small reduction in steel output in Japan in 1992 seems on the cards. \"It would be ironic, and typi- cal of the mining industry, that this occurs as some expansion in iron ore output is evident. Additional incremental capac- ity is planned and proposed in Australia, with a significant proportion emerging in 1992. \"The lifting of sanctions against South Africa will give that country's mines scope to expand both production and exports. The benefits of the lower currency make South African exports competitive in the Asian region. While the volume of exports is relatively small, the important point is that it is another source of sup- ply for the Asians.\" Mr Cooke at Capels points out that, although iron ore prices in nominal terms have risen by about 5 per cent a year compound for 20 years, this has not been enough to keep pace with inflation in the OECD countries. There has been a 36 per cent fall in the price in US dollar terms since 1970 while in Yen terms the present iron ore price is only 10 per cent above the one nego- tiated in 1970 because of the consistent appreciation of the Yen during that time. He says that the Japanese might want to give Brazilian iron ore producers special treatment in order to guaran- tee a long-term diversity of supply. Profits of the Brazilian producers are depressed and their future capital require- ments are high. However, says Mr Cooke, the Japanese steel companies might narrow the price differ- ential between lump and fines iron ore, given that Australia is the predominant lump pro- ducer and Brazil is the impor- tant fines producer. This would give bigger price increases to the Brazilians while not overtly discriminating on price between Australia and Brazil.",

   "text_content" : "SHE WORD filower busi ness is booming and Colombia has both the quality and the quantity of car- nations, roses and chrysanthe mums to stay ahead of its com- petitors. That was the message that came across strongly from international flower experts gathered in Bogota for last week's Carnation Symposium. An associated flower fair, with displays ranging from bronze r-ompoms to the locally-devel- oped black anthurium, from Wellington boots to refriger- ated trucks, re-affirmed the industry's vitality. Colombia is second only to The Netherlands as a flower exporter, with some 8 per cent of the world market. In 20 years, earnings have risen from $lm to $229m and the huge plastic tents of producers have stretched over the high green plain, known as the Sabana de Bogota. The flower farms, varying from about four to 22 hectares (54 acres), are large compared with those of most other countries: growing for export is a company, rather than a family, business. Climatic conditions on the Sabana de Bogota are ideal. It has plenty of light, few frosts and barely any seasonal change in temperature. Flow- ers can be produced all year round without any heating or cooling costs. However, Colombia is not the only country with these advantages, according to Mr leg Cox, of Shalimar Flowers, Kenya. He says: \"Kenya has even better conditons, with clear skies and well-drained soils. The airport is good and it's only eight hours to Europe.\" About 15 per cert of Color- bia's flower exports go to Europe - primarily to the UK, Sweden and Germany. \"Because there are no extremes of climate, Colombia can programme its crop and plant specifically for European holiday dates,\" says Mr Ruund Baarse, export manager of a Dutch carnation breeding com- pany. He explains: \"Carnation prices have been good ir Europe for the past year and Colombia has benefited from the cut in import tariffs. The limitation is freight capacity.\" A new development in trans port - the Freshtainer, with total atmospheric control of temperature, humidity and gases - may provide the answer to the freight problem. Freshtainers can be packed with eight tonnes of carnations and the Bogota-Hamburg jour ney by truck and sea takes 24-26 days. Several shipments have already been sent to Germany and the UK. The flowers arrive in good condition because they are effectively put into hiber ination. This system is a little cheaper than the cost of air freight to Europe. However, the US is Colom- bia's most important market and air cargo services to Miami - the main flower dis- tribution centre - has become much more reliable. Because flowers have been used to camouflage cocaine in the past, boxes are searched on eaving Bogota and on arrival in Miami but handling proce- dures are speeding-up. For fowers, a delay at the airport or rough treatment can be fatal. Colombia's competitive prices have brought a spate of legal actions in the US against alleged dumping and for other reasons despite the fact that exporters forego local tax incentives. Recent rulings reduced anti-dumping taxes on carnations and chrysanthe- mums. Now growers on the West Coast of the US arecom- plaining that lax environmen- tal controls give their Colom- bian competitors an unfair advantage. The bigger Colombian com- panies have taken measures to prevent health hazards and to improve conditions for the largely female workforce. But one foreign flower breeder says: \"I've seen some very careless spraying with danger- ous chemicals, then the chemi- cals being dumped straight into water.\" S ome 95 per cent of US car- nation imports are sup- plied by Colombia, as well as three-quarters of the chrysanthemums and 70 per cent of the roses supplied from abroad. This traditional mar- ket, which has been built-up around key dates, such as Christmas and Valentine's Day, is changing. The new emphasis is on supplying a small but growing year-round consumer who buys in the supermarket \"The mixed bouquet is the future,\" says Mr Rodrigo de Narvaez of Imperial Flowers. \"People don't want to go to the florist and have the trouble of choosing, they want to pick-up a pretty mix at the supermar- ket. Our other new product is the bunchkin, with very small flowers. It sits in a box and is easy to take on a bus.\" ironically, growers have not caught up with the change and so the green ferns used in bou- quets have to be brought to Bogota from the US, then re-ex- ported. It can take years to develop new varieties and colours. The main variables for a top-class carnation are the strength of the stem, the size of the flower, colour, growing speed and, above all, resistance to dis- eases. like fulsarium. Different countries have different prefer- ences - the UK is very strong on soft pink colours. Scent, curiously ,s far down the list of priorities. \"Colour and size matter most but if a flower has scent that's an advantage,\" comments Mr Luis Acevedo of Yoder Brothers, an international breeding com- pany, which has developed six new varieties of disease-resis- tant carnation in Colombia. Local growers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and more interested in breeding and diversifying. Charging roy- alties is a complicated business and there is a lot of plant- pirating but the Colombian government is planning to put through legislation to protect domestic and foreign breeders. Spurred by their success and expertise, Colombian investors are looking elsewhere. Japan is a promising new market and Colombians are behind some new flower-growing ventures in Mexico, Central America and Ecuador. \"Colombia has the infra- structure, the climate and the technology, in fact they should be exporting agronomists,\" observes Mr Paul Damn, a US consultant. \"Now they've got the perish- able marketing mentality, too, and they're applying it to fruit exports.\"",

   "text_content" : "POIJTICS replaced economics as the dominant actor on the foreign exchanges yesterday. This led to covering-o\" shof t dollar positions after the cur- rency had held above the DM1.6700 level. , A report that US warplanes have been put on alert for pos- sible action against Iraq helped reverse the dollar's recent downward trend. It was said in Washington that forces from the US and its allies could be involved if Iraq falls to comply with United Nations resolu- tions to destroy nuclear, chem- ical and biological weapons. A little later news that Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, was suffering from a \"minor heart problem\" added to the demand for the dollar as trading became increasingly nervous. Economic news had little impact, with US housing starts in August in line with expecta- tions. Action by the Federal Reserve, adding liquidity to the New York banking system, came 30 minutes ahead of the usual time, but was said to be purely technical. Federal funds were trading at 5% per cent, compared with an assumed tar- get level of 5% per cent, when the Fed added money through overnight system repurchase agreements. At the London close the dol- lar had climbed to DM1.6815 from DM1.6705; to Y13420 from Y133.80; to SFrl4685 from SFrl.4585; and to FFr5.7275 from FFr5.6875. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index rose to 65.0 from 64.7. Sterling was helped against the D-Mark by the dollar's rally and also gained support fm a UK opinion poll putting the ruling Conservatives level with the opposition Labour Party. Recent polls giving the Conservative Party a lead have increased speculation about an early general election, but this was dampened yesterday removing some of the immedi- ate political risk in holding the pound. Dealers pointed out however that this may only last until the next opinion poll and that the currency remains vulnerable to changing politi- cal sentiment. The remark in a speech by Mr Robin Leigh-Pembetton, governor of the Bank of England, that he is confident \"we are now coming out of recession\" had no immediate hipact. mterling fell 1.10 cents to $1.7815 against the firmer dol- lar, but rose to DM2.9125 froit DM2.9100 and to FFr9.9175 hiro F'r9.9100. The pound was steady at SFr2.5425 but fell to Y232.25 from Y233.25. Its index lost 0.1 to 90.9. Sterling moved up from sec- ond to third weakest member of the European exchange rate mechanism, while the D-Mark fell from third to fourth stron gest and was replaced in thir position by the Italian lira. There was no reaction to the comment by Mr Hans Tiet meyer, Bundesbank deputy president, that price rises in Germany are unacceptably nigh. The French franc remained the weakest ERM currency, but at the Paris fixing the D-Mark fell to FFr3.4053 from MrU3.4075 C I1I NEW YO K Sep.18 Close 1 Â£Spot......... 1.7285-1.7295 1.7420-1.743 month.... 0.73-072pm1 0.76-0.74p 3mo ...... 1.97-1.9pm 1.99-1.96pm 12 months.... 6.60-65pm 6.57-650p For ardpremimns and discounts apply to the US dolar STMRUNG INDEX Sep.18 Previous 8.30 am ........... 91.1 91.1 9.00 arm ........... 91.1 911 10.00 am ........... 91.0 91.1 11.00 am .......... 91.0 91.0 N m .............. 91.1 91.0 1.00 pm ........... 91.0 91.0 2.00 pm ........... 90.9 91.1 300 p ........... 90.9 91.0 4.00 pm . 90.9 91.0 CURRENCY MOVRMENTS Bank of Morgan* Sep 18 Egand Guaraty 90.9 -20.6 S............ 65.0 -14.4 Canadlian Dollar 106.0 +3.4 austrlanSchilling 109.1 +11.7 an Franc.......... 110.8 -2.3 D*Isn ..n........ 106.4 +3.2 -Mark.................. 117.5 +24.2 SsFranc............. 1095 +18.5 AtclhGilder........... 113.6 +15.7 French Franc............ 102.3 -13.4 ULra .............. 98.6 -19.8 Yen .......... .. 138.4 +71.1 ..Morgan Guaranty changes: average 1980-1982-100.

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES ended a four- day rising sequence yesterday on arbitrage-related selling and profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 125.83 at 23,317.78 after a day's high of 23,499.06 and a low of 23,258.57. Volume increased to 600m shares from 550m, boosted by active cross- trading by financial institu- tions ahead of the interim clos- ing of books. Foreign investors were still active buyers, but some domestic institutions were taking profits. Losses outnumbered gains by 560 to 453, with 153 issues unchanged. The Topix Index of all first section stocks shed 7.56 to 1,800.15, but in London trad- ing the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.38 to 1,366.60. Arbitrageurs unwound their cash positions against futures as the September futures expired yesterday. Heavy index-related selling pushed the Nikkei index to the day's low during the afternoon. Large-capital issues lost ground on profit-taking. The sector had been popular recently on expectations of a cut in the official discount rate. Mitsubishi Heavy Indus- tries eased Y3 to Y746, while Nippon Steel fell Y9 to Y427 on reports that leading steel com- panies had decided to reduce steel output by 4 to 5 per cent for the current year. Foreign investors continued to buy electricals, following their recent sell-off on projec- tions of lower earnings. TDK gained Y160 to Y5,670 and Toshiba added Y19 at Y714. Speculative issues rose in active trading. Clarion moved ahead Y100 to Yl,550, Honshu Paper added Y100 at Y901 and Nippon Carbon set an all-time high of Y2,230, up Y280. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, con- cerned over the speculative activity, announced that the minimum margin requirement for Nippon Carbon would be raised to 60 per cent of trad- ing value from 50 per cent. Shionogi, the drug company, closed Y30 ahead at Y1,320 after attaining a record high of Y1,370 in the morning on reports that it had developed a drug to prevent the spread of cancer tissue. Meiji Seika, another cancer drug-related stock, jumped Y110 to Y1,300 in heavy trading. In Osaka, the OSE average rose for the fourth consecutive day, advancing 83.37 to 25,929.55. Volume more than doubled from 62m to 138m shares on cross-trading, as individual investors bought electric machinery shares and retailers. Daishinpan, the consumer loan company, dropped Y21 to Y680. Investors were discour-' aged by reports that the com- pany was expecting losses for the current year, owing to its involvement in the recent stock scandal centring on an Osaka-based restaurateur. Roundup THERE WERE pockets of opti mism in the region yesterday, but senior markets were wor- ried and weakening. TAIWAN liked a news report that the Ministry of Finance has decided not to force trust companies to reduce their stock holdings before they are allowed to become commercial banks. The existing eight trust companies hold listed stocks worth an estimated T$27bn. The weighted index advanced 107.10 or 2.4 per cent to 4,639.35 as turnover climbed from T$10bn to T$19bn. BANGKOK saw rises in finance issues and small com- panies. After absorbing some profit-taking, the SET index gained ground to close 7.28 higher at 718.48 in turnover of Bt2.6bn. SEOUL's hopes for improved inter-Korean rela- tions, given the admission of both South and North Korea to the United Nations on Tues- day, were muted by news that police had shot and killed a student during an anti-govern- -nent demonstration. The comn- posite index ended just 2.54 up at 685.49. HONG KONG continued to worry that Jardine Matheson might delist, yesterday's rumour being that it could sell Hongkong Land, the colony's biggest and most prestigious commercial landlord. The Hang Seng index fell 38.23 to 3,900.48 as turnover expanded from HK$888m to HK$927m. Hongkong Land gained 5 cents to HK$8.75 and Jardine Matheson put on 75 cents to HK$33 on a rise in profits and interim dividend. SINGAPORE tired of waiting for inspiration and the Straits Times Industrial index declined 9.54 points to 1,385.34 as turnover rose from S$55m to S$69m; KUALA LUMPUR lost 1.3 per cent as the composite index closed 7.02 lower at 529.30 on index-linked selling. AUSTRALIA drifted easier amid continuing concern about the strong Australian dollar. The All Ordinaries index shed 2.8 to 1,553.1 as turnover grew from A$171m to A$253m. Australian Consolidated Minerals rose 8 cents to A$1.14 after the UK-based ASP Group accepted an offer for its 35 per cent stake in ACM, for which Normandy Poseidon and West- ern Mining have been bidding A$1.11 a share. The terms were improved yesterday to incorpo- rate a 5-cent final dividend. NEW ZEALAND was hit by a 9-cent fall to NZ$3.31 in Fletcher Challenge, which has lost 39 cents since September 9 on its exposure to the world newsprint market. Fletcher has a 20 per cent weighting in the NZSE 40-share index, which supped 3.84 to 1,409.84. MANILA closed mixed, with the composite index off 0.74 to 906.95. There were reports that the state-controlled Philippine National Bank wants to defer its planned stock offering because of perceived political and economic uncertainties. JAKARTA weakened in active trading as foreign inter- est continued to wane. The index fell 9.72 or 3.5 per cent to 271.57 in 5.5m share volume.",

   "text_content" : "IT WVM a s mall revoution. last Moilday the Lisbon Stock Exchange adopted for the first time a systenm ci continuous trading. Three stocks were selected to test the system, which will be extende to all shares, iad in spite OF two unscheduled power cut and confusion generated by the coexistence of the old and new systems, the experiment was deemed a success. The change did nothing, however, to raise spirits on the market, which has been in the doldrums for most of the year, with the exception of a brief rally after the Gulf war. Ana- lysts continue to look anx- iously for sins of a recovery. The year be badly, with the Gulf crisis helping to drive down the Banco Totta &Acores index to 1,966.6 on January 16 - its lowest point this year and way below its January 1990 peak of 3,281. In the war's aftermath the index picked up temporarily to reach 2,515.2 in March 18, but it has fallen gradually ever since, closing at 2,192.9 on Tuesday. Analysts nevertheless say they d ct ;a slight resurgeneh of inteeset o6mM foreign inves- tore, and they hope that a com- binaton of domestic and inter- national factors will breathe new life into the market and restore confidence. On the domestic front, they say a victory for the ruling social democrats (PSD) in the general election next month should help to pave the way for a recovery in the last quar- ter. \"A PSD victory wll be seen as heralding another four years of stability, and we could see a rally in October,\" says a leading fund manager in Lisbon. \"Foreign investors will look at a positive result for the PSD very favourably,\" agrees an analyst with a London based international broker. Analysts say that foreign investors, who account for a major proportion of turnover in shares on the Lisbon and Oporto exchanges, recently began to show renewed inter- est in Portuguese equities, especially in construction sec- tor companies. But future developments are likely to depend on the election results. The socialist party, which poses the biggest challenge to the government, hopes to deny the ruling party another abso- lute majority. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minis- ter, has threatened to take his party into opposition if that happens. Such an outcome would open up a period of 5 I peiIuca. uncetainIty, ainoujn most observers believe that ts PSD will win. Analysts also believe that a Portuguese market recovery could be helped by ongoing reforms and international developments. \"Europe has been seen in a more favourable ight recently. Investors have made capital gains in other markets and they are looking to markets which have not recovered yet, so the timing is right,\" an analyst says. The reform of the securities market embodied in new legis lation, known as the Lei Sapa teiro, wis adopted last May and became effective in July, although its implementation Is taking place step by step. Ahead of the new law, an official daily index was launched earlier this year, and a new independent securities exchange commission, the Comissao do Mercado dos Val ores Mobiliarios, has been set UP to regulate and supervise the market, taking ove responsibilities previously held by the Finance Ministry. The Lisbon and Oporto exchanges are being linked by computer to form a single mar- ket with unified prices. The exchanges will be privatised, and new products such as options and futures will be introduced to broaden the market These and other opera- tional reforms aim to liberalise and modernise the market, bringing it closer to European Community stan- dards. Transaction procedures and the flow of information are set to improve, while rules on the provision of company infor- maion have been tightened sharply, and companies must now provide independently audited accounts. All these changes will not have an immediate effect, but analysts hope that by making the market more efficient and transparent they will raise con- fidence in the Portuguese bourse and provide a psycho- logical stimulus. \"Investors like to see reforms, and this will help,\" says one analyst.",

   "text_content" : "MADRID WAS virtually a one-stock market yesterday as Trelef6nica accounted for about half of total market turnover. On other bourses, the after noon news of US military movements in the Persian Gulf and a Soviet news report, sub sequently denied, that Russian President Boris Yeltsin was ir hospital brought an attack of nerves to some bourses, writes our Markets Staff. MADRID was dominated by Telef6nica, which leapt PtaUS or 6.2 per cent to Ptal,115 on huge volume of 5.88m shares. The gain followed news from an analysts' meeting in Madrid that the telecommunications group is changing its dividend policy, raising hopes of higher dividends. The company also said profits this year would be better than forecast, and pre dicted a profits rise of an aver- age 15 per cent a year to 1994. The group meets analysts in London today at the start of an international tour. Telef6nica shares have been strong in the US and Spain, rising 13.5 per cent in Madrid so far this month. Qne.analy* warned, however, that they looked overpriced, and said a capital increase in the medium term was inevitable. She added that talk of a rerating of the stock was misleading, because this had already been achieved. The shares used to trade at a discount to the market of 20-3C per cent, but they were now trading in line. The general index edged up 0.78 to 272.61 in turnover of Ptal3bn, up from PtalObn. FRANKFURT extended its day to include active trading in the pre and post-bourse. It had a good beginning, with shares up by 0.3 per cent in the first 20 minutes of trade, but then sentiment deteriorated. After a 1.44 fall to 675.144 in the FAZ at midsession, the DAX closed 6.48 or 0.4 per cent lower at 1,628.07, volume rising from DM4.1bn to DM4.5bn. But the big international blue chips lost another 0.5 to 1 per cent in the London post-bourse. Mr Matthias Welticke, an",

BMW fell DM7.50 to DM502.50 in the official Frankfurt session, and another DM3 after hours. The fact that Volkswagen, a recent favourite, lost DM9.10 to DM363.10 during the session, and just DM2.60 more later, iended to put the scare argu- ments into perspective. According to Mr Welticke, Frankfurt was disturbed late in the day by reports that IG Met- all, the metalworkers' union, wants a 10%/ per cent wage rise. This would affect mostly carmakers and steels, he said. Miannesmann more than dou- bled its losses in the aftermar- ket to end at an indicated DM268, down from DM273.80. PARIS succumbed to profit- taking, bringing the series of 1991 highs to an end. The CAC 40 index closed 9.01 down at 1,869.41. Turnover was moder- ate at FFr2bn after Tuesday's FFr2.7bn, as the 1992 budget failed to stir the market. CSEE, the electronics com- pany suspended since Septem- ber 2, jumped FFr10.90 or 6.5 per cent to FFr179.10 on specu- lation that the takeover offer from Quadral could face com- petition. Hutchison, the chemi- cals company, was suspended amid rumours that Total could buy out minority shareholders. Casino added another FFr4.80 to FFrl57.90 on the pre- vious day's news of an asset sale, and on a suggestion by one broker that Casino could lease out its hypermarkets. AMSTERDAM lost its earlier gains to close mostly lower on fears of instability in the Gulf. The CBS tendency index fin- ished 0.4 down at 91.8 after peaking at 92.5. Higher oil prices lifted Royal Dutch by F 1.20 to Fl 154.30. ZURICH closed at its day's lows on the Gulf news, the Crdit Suisse index falling 3.9 to 520.6. Nestld topped the actives list as its bearers fell SFrl20 to SFr8,200. MILAN was lifted by a strong showing from Generali as its L1.7 trillion capital increase proceeded. The Comit index added 6.91 to 552.30 in turnover estimated at near Tuesday's L77bn. Generali shares rose L800 or 3.1 per cent to L26,670 while the rights rose L300 or 8.6 per ent to Lj,801. Among industrials, Fiat dded L63 or 1.2 per cent to .5,535. Bassetti, the textiles producer, rose L270 or 2.1 per cent to L13,370 after surprising the market with a 20 per cent rise in first half profits. STOCKHOLM closed little changed as investors waited for the new government to be formed. The Affarsvirlden 3eneral index eased 1.0 to 1,081.2, and turnover to SKr282m from SKr359m. Astra continued to dominate, as the free Bs fell SKr4 to SKr556. Stena Line, the shipping and ferry operator, saw its free Bs sink SKr9 to SKr48 after saying that it expected to make a pre- tax loss of SKr300Om. BRUSSELS was dragged lower again by Delhaize, the retailer, which accounted for about a third of the day's turn- over. The Bel20 index fell 5.50 to 1,105.99, as Delhaize lost BFr7 to BFr7,500 on worries about potential claims from a union for damages at its US subsidiary, :Food Lion."

After climbing 10 points to regain the 2,600 mark, the FT-8E Index fell away steadily in the afternoon to close 10.8 down on balance at 2,583.6. Trading strategists pointed nervously to Footsie 2,575 as the nearest support level Once again, the market was described as stock specific. Seaq volume reached 678.2m shares, against the 699.1m reg- istered on Tuesday, with yes- terday's figure including trad- ing of 55m shares in Asda, 36m in Hanson, 24m in Racal Elec- tronics and rlm in Vodafone. Since last Thursday, UK equitles'have fallen by around 2.2 per cent as the glow of cr- porate results has brought unsettling developments in a stock market pinning its faith on economic recovery. The Governor of the Bank of England said yesterday that wile confiden that the UK was coning out of recession, he \"would be cautious on inter- est rate cuts\". The decline in share prices has taken place in spite of a background of more than Â£lbn in takeover bids, launched by Hanson for Beazer and by Wil- liams Holdings for Racal Elec- tronics. Takeover activity is conventionally seen as a sign of investor confidence and strategists had hoped that, with bid activity less promi- nent yesterday, share prices might have staged a recovery. The stock market faces sev- eral more hurdles in the shape of corporate trading reports over the next week. In particu- lar, there is some nervousness ahead of trading news from the building and construction sec- tor, which will be eagerly scanned for the latest evidence on the strength, or otherwise, of the economic recovery. There were also hints yester- day that another sizeable rights issue was in the offing, perhaps as funding for the next bid among Footsie-listed stocks. * The FT-SE 100 Steering Committee yesterday held its quarterly review of the index components and decided to include Northern Foods in the FT-SE list and to remove mUtramar."

   "text_content" : "ASDA shares slumped by almost 29 per cent in the heavi- est day's trading for more than our years after the company warned that profits and divi- dends would fall. At the annual meeting, Sir Godfrey Messervy, the chair man, said: \"We foresee a very significant deterioration in our results for 1991/92.\" The interim dividend could be as ow as 1.25p, compared with ast year's interim of 1.85p, he added. Analysts dropped their prof ts forecasts for the whole year from around Â£170m-plus to less han Â£100m in many cases. They and traders agreed that he shares would have fallen 'urther yesterday if there had not been a bout of bid specula- ion. The consensus was that a iK predator was less likely han one from elsewhere in Surope. Asda fell 27 to 67p on turn- over of 55m, representing almost 5 per cent of the num- er of shares in issue. It also opped the list of actives in the traded options market, where the equivalent of more than 3m shares changed hands. Jitters over how other food etailers might be faring sent Argyll 6 lower to 289p and Tesco down 7 to 259p, while Marks and Spencer, whose ood retailing business is ncreasingly important, weak- ened 9 to 269p. Demand for Hanson UK institutions piled into Hanson, pushing turnover to 36m, the highest for more than hree years. It was the third session in a row with more han 26m shares changing hands; nearly 2 per cent of lanson shares have been raded this week. The dominance of buyers in he wake of Hanson's agreed akeover bid on Monday for Beazer was reflected in an advance of 6 for Hanson shares yesterday to 224p. Traders pointed out that even at this lvel, the shares are only just above a three-year relative low against the market. BICC uncertainty BICC, the cables and con- truction group, came under ustained pressure, retreating to 404p as dealers marked the hares lower on stories that a lare placirng was Immin'et. It was felt that one of Lon- don's leading agency brokers was trying to place 10.25m shares at around 400p each. The Seaq delayed ticker showed no evidence of any trades at that price, however, and it was thought that the placing had been aborted. Turnover was shown as 471,000 shares. Dealers said the 10.25m shares, equivalent to a 3.7 per cent stake in BICC, could have come from Fornara, the Italian group, which acquired the stock from BICC at the turn of the year. BICC stock has come under pressure over the past two weeks, with several broking houses, notably UBS Phillips & Drew, taking a bearish stance. UBS told its clients to sell the shares at 456p. National Power and Poweri- Gen were in good form, responding to their under performance against the wider market since mid-July, and to recent strong buy recommen dations from two broking houses, Kleinwort Benson and Salomon Brothers. There was also talk of a series of US pro motional roadshows. PowerGen gained 4 to 171p on 2.3m shares traded and National Power added 3% at 156'/%p on 5.2m. More1 intense activity devel oped in Racal Electronics, where traders continued to search for evidence of yet more stakebuilding and the identity of possible counter-bidders. Turnover in Racal came out at 24m shares and included sub stantial bouts of profit-taking interspersed with talk of stake building and keen speculative support. The shares closed a penny easier at 56%p. Vodafone ran up 8 to 358p in spite of hints that one of the big US invest- ment banks, a strong supporter of Vodafone since its flotation three years ago, had placed a line of 4m shares at 356p. A block of 4.4m changed hands at 353p minutes later. Midland Bank outpaced the rest of the sector, with dealers mentioning a substantial switch operation out of Nat- West and into Midland and plenty of straight buying inter- est in the latter. Midland was up 8 at 246p, having touched 248p, with turnover a higher than usual 9.1m. The switch consisted of 2.4m Midland bought at 249p and 1.7m Nat. West sold at 346p. NatWest closed 4 lower at 344p on turn- over of 3.6m. Oils were in better shape after recent weakness. BP shrugged off rights issue sto- ries and firmed 2 to 330p. Lasmo was strong on highly encouraging drilling news from Italy, where its Tempo Rosso 2 well, drilled off the coast of southern Italy, tested over 3,000 barrels of oil a day. Lasmo, badly hit by a big sell- ing order recently, picked up 2 to 298p, reflecting its 40 per cent stake in the discovery. Enterprise, with a 33 per cent interest in the licence area, rose 6 to 513p. Reuters advanced at the expense of Unilever as County NatWest replaced the latter with the former in its list of 30 favoured shares. The price moves were additionally encouraged by more bullish noises on Reuters from US securities houses and a recom- mendation from S.G. Warburg that investors should switch out of the Unilever pic shares into the NV. The plc slipped 9 to 745p while the NV, quoted in Lon- don, rose A to Â£48ft. Reuters FTA A114Share Index 1300 1250 1200 1150 Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Excluding: Intra-market busine & Overeas tumovr 600 400 200 0 firmed 12 to 936p, its highest level for a year. Hawker Siddeley rose 9 to 602p on turnover of im ahead of today's interim results Rolls-Royce gained 3'/% to 142Ysp on volume of 6.8m after Lehman Brothers put the stock on its list of recommended buys for US investors. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, at the secu- rities house, said: \"The com- pany is through the worst. We can look to more positive sac- tors such as progressive recov- ery in civil aerospace spares, a gradual reduction in R & D costs and favourable currency movements.\" British Aerospace closed 3 up at 404p on good turnover of 5.7m as the company held a meeting for investors in Scot- land. Buying was noted around the 400p level. British Steel edged forward 1% to 126p on turnover of 8.9m. UBS Phillips&Drew, the com- pany's broker, favours the stock and published a note on British Steel, due to land on investors' desks today. Kwik-Fit forged ahead 14 to 169p after reporting a 67 per cent expansion in half-time profits to Â£16.7m, well ahead of market forecasts. Aberfoyle Holdings tumbled following news that the com- pany could be put into admin- istration should it fail to raise additional funds. At one stage the shares were down 5% at 4'/%p but later steadied to close a net 4 off at 6p. Nervousness ahead of today's results affected Laporte, which relinquished 4 to 558p. BET saw another heavy turnover as the company held presentations for large share- holders and institutions yester- day. Buyers were encouraged after meeting Mr John Clark, the new chief executive, while sellers decided that the shares had risen to the point where it was time to take profits. The stock gained 4 to 227p on 9.4m shares traded, following Tues- day's volume of 11m. Brewery products maker Alumasc rose 16 to 304p on annual results and a confident statement from the chairman. USM-quoted Jeyes Group, maker of household cleaning products, improved 12 to 380p following a 19 per cent boost in half-year profits reported on Tuesday. MB-Caradon declined 5 to 245p as investors reconsidered Tuesday's interim results. Institutions continued to buy blue chip stocks selectively. Traders reported steady client business in Reed International, 8 higher at 491p, and Tate SLyle, 6 better at 403p. The pick of the property issues advanced similarly, with MEPC adding 8 at 500p and British Land 7 at 330p. Among smaller property shares, Merivale Moore gained 10 to 148p, while further con- sideration of results this week from Brixton Estates left the stock 6 lower at 206p.
