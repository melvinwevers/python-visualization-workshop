   "text_content" : "By Our Commercial Editor There is growing pressure within the building society movement, especially from the smaller societies, to go ahead with the agreed rise in lending rates to 7J per cent. in spite of the Government request for further delay. A number of large and influential societies still favour some compliance with the Government request, especially since the movement's financial position remains consider- ably easier than was expected in face of the general rise in interest rates. But it now appears doubtful if these advocates of a \"political\" decision will be able to muster the necessary two-thirds majority required to alter the decision to raise rates when the Council of the Association meets to-day week. The extent of any concession will depend on the view, which may only emerge after a bitter debate, which the Council takes of the outlook for the move- ment. At present, funds are coming in at a somewhat reduced rate, but unexpectedly well against the general rise in interest rates. Money is still being lent at about three-quarters of the record rate set at the beginning of the year, and, while some in- dividual societies and branches are acutely embarrassed, there is not yet anything like a general famine. Funds may Include \"Hot\" Money However, there is a fairly wide- spread fear that a good deal of the money now coming in may be hot money, which could readily disappear as soon as there is any real stock market recovery. More immediately, competition from the local authorities might well become still sharper within quite a short time. It is generally feared that the situation may be very much less easy by the end of the year, and some societies expect to draw in the reins still further within a matter of weeks. Many managers, in fact, want to preserve their freedom to raise the rate offered to investors at the shortest possible notice, and this cannot be done if the rate to borrowers is pegged at 6% per cent. Indeed, some societies are already offering 4% per cent. for two-year term deposits in order to give a second line of protection to their liquid funds-deposits which can at the moment only be carred to the level of the new loans which have been made at 7% per cent. The general feeling is, therefore, that if the Council can be per. suaded to change its policy at all it is unlikely to go beyond a delay in the rise for existing borrowers until January 1. This would not. of course, apply to those who took out new mort. gages at 7% per cent. after the general rise for new borrowers in May.

This is administratively simpler than with- drawing the existing notices and issuing new ones. Two Important Advantages This limited concession to the Government would have two im- portant advantages apart from the obvious one of easing the financial position on January 1, First, it would be a decision taken in advance of the report of the Prices and Incomes Board re- port on building society reserves. The Government request to delay a decision until that report is not only technically impossible (unless some decision is taken next week. the rise in rates is more or less automatic) but is seen as a trap, If the Council agreed to wait for the Board before deciding when rates should rise and by how much, it is felt, it would be com- mitted to accepting a report it has not seen. Secondly, it would apply across the Board. The Treasury has in effect asked the movement to comply with the freeze by putting off all future rises, but would have allowed rises which came into force before the freeze to stand. * Voluntary Act of Self-Denial This is seen as invidious between one society and one borrower and another and quite unacceptable. It also implies an admission that building society rates are subrnct to the incomes freeze, a principle which the movement is not pre, pared to concede. Those in favour of helping the Government on the rates, front (at the expense, as they point out, of the Government'l housing target) want at any rate to he thanked for a voluntary act of self-denial. iment Page 10",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. The U.S. Government is now caught up in a difficult dilemma over the maintenance of forces in West Germany. The Administration has to decide whether or not to forgo some of its own offset costs from Germany, or to acquiesce to the withdrawal of some troops I by Britain. The Americans hope to escape this predicament by tripartite talks on support costs with the U.K. and Germany. But there is no great optimism here that they will be successful, even if they can be set up-Presi- dent Johnson's proposal for a tri- angular discussion of the subject has been accepted in principle by the U.K.. but not yet by Germany Various Schemes Various ingenious schemes, such as a military payments union, are still being mooted here, but no- one has yet found an answer to the basic intractable difficulty- that as a result of the American sales drive in Germany in the past, German forces have become almost entirely dependent on American equipment, and it follows that any requirement for British equipment has to be cre. ated artificially. The American Government Is faced, on the one hand, by the in. creasingly bitter criticism in Con. gress of the contributions of the other Allies, particularly Germany, to the NATO effort. These feelings resulted yesterday in the embarrass. ing resolution tabled in the Senate by the Democratic Policy Group which calls for \"substantial reduc. tions\" in U.S. force levels in Europe. On the other hand, there Is the British Government's determina- tion announced on August 19 and reaffirmed to-day, to reach a quick decision on its own offset problem. This problem, many American officials fear, can be solved satis- factorily only if the U.S. is pre- pared to sacrifice some of its own claims on the German Govern- ment. The British request for the filling of' its support costs \"gap\" of Â£40m. poses the following ques- tions for Washington. The U.S. could:- 1-Accept the British proposal to modify the U.K.'s logistic requirements, now calculated on the basis of a 30-day war in Western Europe, to a 10-day war. thus saving Â£13m. to Â£15m. 2-Accept the reductions of British combat forces neces- sary to close the rest of the gap in costs. 3-Try to steamroller the Erhard Government into meeting the British request. 4-Release the German Govern- ment from its present obliga- tion to buy $1,071m. of American arms and equipment in the next 12 months.

The further rally in equity leaders yesterday was much less vigorous than on Wednesday, but it was important that the market stood up well to being tested. Stock which came out on the initial rise was well absorbed, and after being only 0.1 up at noon, the share index was finally 1.7 higher at 304.5. There was a larger turnover, certainly in the leaders, and the closing tone was firm. Rank Rank's results show that where- as Rank-Xerox continues to live up to the best expectations, the rest of the group has failed to meet its forecast of unchanged profits. Overall sales are Â£152.2m., against Â£127.1m. and profits before tax Â£18.87m., against Â£11.385m. How- ever. Rank-Xerox contributed Â£14.786m. of this total so the balance fell from Â£4.42m. to Â£4.08m. The cause for a further modest decline in the second half remains to be revealed but reports that the hotel division lost Â£400,000 more than in 1964-65 neatly account for the shortfall. Cer- tainly the rise in Gaumont British's trading profits from Â£2.07m. to Â£2.73m. suggests the film side is doing all right. Although the group total is satis- factory enough and the rise in the datum line to Â£5.266m. allows Rank to maintain a reasonable slice of the R-X cake. earnings are only 29.1 against 23.8 per cent. The villain is a jump in the tax charge, excluding investment allowances, between the two halves from 40.6 to 50.8 per cent., perhaps because of non-offsettable losses or the fact that more of Rank-Xerox's profits are being made overseas. Since the dividend stays at 21 per cent. in deference to the Freeze, the \"A\" at 24s 7%d yield 4.3 per cent. and are selling at 16.7 times earnings. The shares are still discounting more growth, but nothing spectacular and there is clearly more growth to come. Prospects for the rest of the group must await the chairman's state. ment, though both hotels and TV manufacture seem in for a tough year. Installations by Rank. Xerox, on the other hand, are fore- cast at 32,000 this year against 27.207 in 1965-66 with no real help from the highly profitable 2400. If margins stay constant and the tax charge at 40 per cent. this alone could boost earnings by 8.6 points even allowing for the maximum addition to the equity through con. version. In which case Rank's prospective P/E ratio comes down to 1:.9 times and since the shares have fallen a third from their 1966 \"high \" they must be attractive. The trouble is that Xerox has fallen almost as far on Wall Street and has none of Rank's bits and pieces keeping the brake on over. all growth. See also Page 12 Klinger The Klinger chairman was hoping the second half of 1965, when profits were only Â£21.000, would prove the nadir and so far 1966 seems to be bearing him out. Profits before tax are up from Â£210.000 to Â£247,000 and, more to the point, the 20 per cent dividend which was well short-earned last year will be held provided nothing disastrous happens. Presumably Klinger reckons it can cover this rate which on a full tax charge im- plies pre-tax profits in the last six months of not less than Â£365,000. Given ICI's gloom about the tex- tile industry Klinger may sound unduly optimistic. But, first, it is selling a third of its yarn overseas and has a Â£1.3m. Russian contract to work off. Secondly, in contrast Sto 1965 any further yarn price cuts Sare likely to benefit rather than harm processing margins. Whether I U.K. yarn processing really can hold up at its current level, how- I ever, seems to depend on the acceptance of new usages which is sometimes very slow. IOn the other hand machinery Ssales are also picking up, thanks to orders from Europe and the r U.S., and deliveries in 1967 may well reach a record level. Klinger's Â£313,000 of development expendi- ture last year, therefore, looks to have paid dividends especially since the group is now going into the Sheavy denier end of the market. such as tufted carpets where there Sis still plenty of growth. A 7Y per cent. yield at 14s is nothing to write home about these days but if Klinger's profits really are on the s up and up again the share price a could well have bottomed as well See also Page 12 S J. & F. Stone 5 The hurdle that J. and F. Stone e has got to get over is to provide Scomfortable cover for the dividend s rate.

   "article_dc_title" : "Rally on Wool Market Fades",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-02",
   "text_content" : "By Our ComoIdbl Staf The rally in wool prices on the London Terminal market earlier this week of up to 1%d a pound appeared to have petered out yesterday - values eased margin- ally by O.ld to 0.5d, with the December futures price closing at 110.15d a pound. Market opinion is that the fall of over 3d a pound in London after the start of the Australian sales on August 22 was overdone, and this was followed by a sharp recovery to bring values more into line with predictions of higher world wool prices in the months ahead. Although this may still be the feeling elsewhere, a major cause of the present uncertainty in Bradford is the two-fold effect of the latest economic squeeze: a tightness of funds for holding big stocks, and doubts about the future level of domestic demand. The market now expects resis- tance to further price rises around the H10d a pound level as demon- strated yesterday. This is in marked contrast to the forecasts of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics which predicted higher prices in the coming months on August levels. They pointed out that the current year will show little or no increased output from the main producing countries, but demand from Japan, the EEC countries and the U.S.. following the demands for military supplies from the war in Vietnam, would continue to increase. The U.S. Department of Agricul- ture estimates that overall world consumption should rise in 1966-67 by just over 100m. lbs to 3.350m. lbs, while production should show a very slight increase of 5m. Ibs to 3,250m. Ibs, leaving a world wool deficit of 100m. Ibs. It was predicted earlier this year that the Australian drought would cut back the available supplies of top quality wool. Although it is diffi- cult to analyse the quality of all this year's clip before it appears on the market, the market price has not yet reacted to this possibility of shortage in the higher grades. Another source of uncertainty on the consumption side is to be found in last week's dismissal by ICI of labour from its man-made fibres plants. The belief in Bradford is that this follows over-generous estimates of demand trends, and that the cut- backs indicate a re-adjustment to the reality of the demands situation. A remaining question is whether the reduced production of man-made fibres will delay the price reductions which were to accompany steadily growing output, and the effect of this continuation of the old price on the wool market. Among other factors working against higher prices has been a slackening of demand from Russia, which is stepping up home production after severay years' active buying in world markets. There has also been a tendency for North American and European users to hold smaller stocks because of high interest rates.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent BELFAST, Sept. 1. THERE IS growing concern in Northern Ireland at the effects which the recent trade pact between the U.K. and the Irish Republic are having on Northern Ireland's meat producers. The Mid Ulster Meat Packing Company in Omagh, Co. Tyrone, is the latest plant in the industry to reduce output because of the competition they are facing in the British market from Southern Irish producers. Its 50 workers are being put on a three-day week, and the company is stopping exports of meat to Britain. The Northern Bacon and Can- ning Company of White Abbey. near Belfast, has also cut down exports to England, and a spokes man for the company said yester- day that the agreement had had a \" disastrous \" effect on their English trade. Earlier this week an official of the Emdal meat packing plant in Newry, Co. Down. said that the company, which opened last year, may not reach its employment tar- get of 350. Efforts were to be made to offset the effects of the Anglo-Irish agreement by internal economies, but redundancies among the present labour force of 200 could not be ruled out. Talks in London Talks took place in London yester- day between officials of the Irish Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agriculture on matters of mutual interest. A spokesman at the Irish Embassy in London said: \"It was a routine meeting similar to those held from time to time between the two depart- ments. Matters under discussion in- clude trade between the two countries.\" Farm and food products are among the chief exports from the Republic of Ireland to Britain. Dur- ing the first six months of this year these exports totalled more than Â£84m. Irish imports from Britain were more than Â£86m. for the same period.",

   "text_content" : "by JOHN CHERRINGTON, Our Agricultural Correspondent A DIRECT consequence of the credit squeeze is that at markets and sales where farmers meet all ; the talk is of depression. of a re- turn to the '30s-times that are still evergreen in the memories of many of the older men. In fact, so con- vinced are many that the war and post-war prosperity is a temporary thing, that they are almost happy at the thought that they are at last going to be proved right before they die. I remember a bank chairman say- ing three' or four years ago that the money lent to farmers was ex- ceeded in his own and other banks' cases by the money that farmers lent them. The position may have shifted somewhat since those days as the older farmers die, and their successors struggle to survive the inflated costs of getting into present- day farming, but I believe it may still be generally true. This peasant attitude to money, as a precious thing to be hoarded is. generally speaking, common to smaller farms and livestock areas. But even the more sophisticated larger brethren have in many cases the same attitudes and large re- serves. Frozen Prices On the face of it. though, there is nothing very much for farmers to fear. Prices are guaranteed for some time ahead, and if the freeze is really applied, it should mean costs will not be raised against them. Farming prices, on the other hand, have been effectively frozen for the last ten years or so. There is no concerted move among banks. so far as I have heard, to reduce farmers' actual overdrafts, although there has been refusal to provide finance for new developments, whether in increased livestock or machinery or the purchase of land. The National Farmers' Union has received reports of farmers being refused finance for store he cattle or being forced to sell grain. 1ts But these cases are few in number, ill and without the individual facts it e- is impossible to determine whether ill these are the result of head office my policy or the personal judgment of in- individual bank managers. There ad was a feeling abroad that Mr. ry Callaghan's statement as to the im- py portance of farming in the national tst economy amounted to a directive ire to the banks to give special treat- ment to farmers. The NFU has y- now discovered that there is no he such directive from the Bank of :x- England, and this has come as a Ls' bitter blow to those farmers who :rs think of their industry as a ve number one import saver and iys above the common herd in eir national importance. he nt. Storage Costs ay There is some evidence, or at ey, least gossip in the trade, that the ed arable farmers' big customers, to millers and compounders, are as. restricting buying, or at least not ed taking delivery of grain, and so tes making the farmer bear the re. physical and financial costs of storage. Merchant firms report no increase in debtors, but all speak as if they are going to be really tough with those who rely on this sort of credit to an undue extent. are There is no real indication that ars machinery sales are falling, but 'or some are convinced that when the :ze autumn selling season begins they an will run into real difficulties when ist trying to sell such items as com- ier bines with out-of-season discounts. en They may indeed be right; tractors are being in constant use wear out and ks, need replacement, but the purchase ice of seasonal machinery, combines, gh etc., could well be put off for ide several years if necessary. its, There has been a significant fall or in the prices paid for breeding ad. ewes at the sales in Wales and on other districts. Many are blaming ers this on the squeeze, and this drop >re of between 20 to 30 per cent. on 1. last year's prices has been reflected r, back to the values of the ewe it lambs sold by hill farmers, so hill :r farming may well become even a more uneconomic than it is if already. But the squeeze is only a partly to blame for this; sheep are r. by all the books the least profit- i- able of enterprises on high-cost il land. Besides, something like re 250,000 acres of pasture becomes t- arable every year, and the pressure is on sheep is due as much to short. t0 age of pasture as to financial )f stringency. The same applies to a beef cattle to some degree. 10 a Alien Philosophy in There is a section of farmers, young and often comparative new- comers to the industry, who be- cause of capital shortage are dan- gerously overborrowed from banks at and merchants. To most other 1o farmers, their's is the alien philo- s, sophy that money should be used re to the fullest advantage whether ot owned or borrowed, and as much o1 borrowed as possible to increase te turnover. These men, often among p As the most progressive there are, 10 technically speaking, could already tk be suffering from high interest ly rates on their big proportion of tis borrowed money. Any effort by it. banks to reduce overdrafts would at fall particularly hard on them. In ut farming technical excellence does Be not necessarily equate with sinan- ey cial stability. Dn So with the above-mentioned 1\" exceptions it doesn't look as ts. though the freeze in its present rs form will do much harm to the id main run of farmers or farming so for a while. If. however, it bites 's, the general public hard enough to or cause a real deflation in food prices and in demand for food ill the repercussions could eventually \"g affect the guarantees and so the ad whole basis of farming itself. The ng pessimists, or realists, among far- ap mers have been preparing for such an an eventuality for years.",

The six-day-old strike of miners intensified along Zambia's Copper. belt, with company spokesmen reporting over 33,000 men now idle and production losses of more than 5,000 tons. The strike began last Friday afternoon at the Mufulira mine, owned by Roan Selection Trust, over the question of payments to a mine pension fund. It has since spread to other mines owned by the Trust and Anglo American Corporation, the Ndola copper refinery, and to workers at the Copperbelt Power Corporation."

   "text_content" : "From Our Wall Street Correspondent FURTHER RECOVERIES to S1, or so, were recorded on Wall Street to-day, following short- covering and bargain hunting on the improved yields obtainable along with moves reportedly taking form in Washington to cope with the effects of tight money and inflationary pressures. After a day's high and low of 798.94-782.12, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up another 3.68 to 792.09, making a recovery of 25.06 since last Monday. The Utilities Index moved up 2.12 on the day to 123.45 but the Railroad Index eased 0.03 to 195.73. All United States and Cana. dian Markets will be closed on Monday (Labour Day). Volume, however, showed a further marked contraction, falling another 2.44m. shares to 6.25m.- the lowest total in more than a fortnight-reflecting the approach- ing extended holiday week-end which acted as a brake on buying enthusiasm. Quality Industrials again led the market, with Utilities also in the limelight. Du Pont rose another S3% to $174%, American Telephone put on S1% to $53% and General Motors improved $1' to $74%. Eastman Kodak, however, reacted $1 to $117% under profit-taking. Chrysler lost Sl% to $37-the other motor car com- panies are now offering the same extended new car warranties as Chrysler, thus reducing the latter's competitive advantage. In Utilities, American Electric Power gained $1 to $34%-Michi- gan Gas and Electric has discon- tinued opposition to a take-over offer by A.E.P. NEW YORK, Sept. 1. Most Airlines were lower although Wall Street was expecting good Labour Day week-end traffic. Braniff fell $4% to $61% and Eastern dropped $4% to $69. So-called \" glamour\" shares were still impeded by profit taking and tendencies were erratic. Corning Glass advanced $4% to $297, but Texas Instruments were down $2% to $114%. Gains of over $1 developed in Foremost Dairies at $18% and McKesson and Robbins at $46%. Foremost has invited tenders on up to 550,000 McKesson shares at $53 per share. Good dividend action propped Merritt-Chapman and Scott by $1% to $23%. On the American S.E., Solitron Devices lost another S33 to $95%', but Old Town advanced 52% to $22% on its entry into the photocopy equipment field. Higher in Canada Canadian Stock Markets closed slightly higher in light trading, in sympathy with the New York Market and accompanied by further progress towards settlement of the Canadian rail strike. C.P.R., up Sl% to $56%, were the most active issue. Inter-Pro- vincial Pipeline moved up $% to $76 bid, and gains to nearly $1 were shown by Alcan Aluminium, Shell of Canada and Canadian Steamship Lines. International Nickel lost SY to $84% after its workers approved a strike authorisation.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent OT1AWA, Sept. 1. CANADA'S railwaymen now on strike for the seventh day have been assured by Prime Minister Mr. Lester Pearson, that they can be certain of a wage increase settle- ment of \"at least\" 18 per cent. spread over 1966 and 1967. Any doubts that the increase would, be much higher when the interim raise of 8 per cent. was written into the original end-the strike Bill introduced last Monday have now been removed by Mr. Pearson's statement. . Mr. Poarson entered the debate a few minutes before the Commons approved the Second Reading of the controversial Bill by a vote of 138 to 103. The Commons later gave a final Third Reading to the Bill, which now goes to the Senate for final passage and proclamation this week-end. The hope in Government circles here is that Canadian trains will be running again by next Tuesday or Wednesday. Canada marks Labour Day next Monday which is a holiday. With the Government's firm assurance of at least 18 per cent. increase it is believed here a great majority of 118,000 strikers will go back on jobs next week.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correpondent NEW YORK. Sept 1. A MAJOR sales reshuffle among U.S. car imports could be in the offing following announcements last night by General Motors and Ford Motor, the two leading American manufacturers, that they will extend warranties on their vehicles for the 1967 model year. The two companies, which have previously provided a 24-month, or 24,000 miles, warranty on all parts of their cars, except tyres, will now extend it to five years, or 50,000 miles, for power-train components, comprising engines and transmis- sion. American Motors is expected to follow the lead from its larger com- petitors, while Chrysler has been offering a 5-year/50.000-mile warranty on power-trains for its cars since the 1963 model year. Chrysler, however, has allowed only a 12 months, or 12,000-mile, warranty on other parts of its cars and has indicated that it does not plan to change this arrange- ment following moves by GM and Ford. Aid to Sales Chrysler officials attribute 10 per cent. of company sales to its favour- able warranty arrangements and many industry observers agree- that' these have been a key factor in Chrysler's recovery from its severe sales slump of a few years ago. A Chrysler spokesman said the rate of sales in the U.S. by its French Simca affiliate had risen seven times since 1963 when Simca first offered the special Chrysler warranty. American sales of Rootes cars, which have carried an extended warranty since Chrysler took over their distribution last February, were higher in July than in any month since 1959. A British Ford spokesman said to- day that cars it sells in the U.S. will carry extended warranties, while GM, though stating officially that it has not yet decided, is expected to follow suit with 1967 model cars from its German Opel subsidiary.",

   "text_content" : "By Our New York Correpode By Our New York Conrepondent \"MULTINATIONALISM\" Is fast becoming one of the most fashion- able words in American business, and nowhere more than among chemical companies. Sheltered by a high tariff wall, these companies have often been chided in the past for protectionism and insularity: and even the gaint Du Pont has bucked a U.S. business trend by failing so far to open a flashy \"front office\" in New York. But chemical manufacturers had dis- covered before the Second World War that they could make profits from exporting and more recently they have been busily building or acquiring production plants abroad* Almost embarrassed by success, some are now trying to cover their blushes with cosmopolitan paint. Direct investments abroad by U.S. manufacturers rose four and a-balf times in the 14 years after 1950 to reach a 1964 total of S16,861m. In this period, the chemical companies ran far above average, expanding their foreign in- vestment sixfold to more than S3,000m. Among major manufac- turing groups, these companies, in both the rate of growth and total value of their capital outlays abroad, were outstripped only by the transportation industry. And whereas their investments were concentrated initially in the Western Hemisphere, they have looked in- creasingly over recent years to the growing European market and to matching there the sophistication of such worldly wise competitors as Royal Dutch/Shell and Imperial Chemical Industries. The rush to foreign markets has already brought radical changes in company sales patterns. Ten years ago, for instance, Union Carbide, the largest chemical manufacturer after Du Pont, made only batteries and related products in overseas plants with sales of a little over S100m. annually; it now has 60 foreign affiliates with sales last year nd wr ur- ny Mse r's np Ste ch i'es :he an VCe Ice on ily to- rill M, lot uit an le- An impression of the Du Pont Lycra elastomeric fibre plant to be built-at Maydown, Northern Ireland. of S5SOm., or around a quarter of Carbide's total revenues; their pro- 4 ducts included chemicals, plastics and foodstuffs as well as batteries. Du Pont, meanwhile, has raised sales of products made abroad more than four times inside 10 years and it now expects its total foreign business to reach S1,000m. annually, or a third of its total current revenues, by the end of the decade. Similar trends have been apparent among such other com- panies as Celanese (seeking a more international image, it dropped \"of America\" from its title last April), Monsanto, American Cyanamid and W. R. Grace, though perhaps the most aggressive of all in pushing worldwide busi- ness in the 1960s has been Dow Chemical. Born in isolationist country at Midland, Michigan, Dow clung for years to a small town image and it was not until 1955, when it started making poly styrene in Britain, that it opened its first manufacturing unit outside North America. Banking Ventures Since then, Dow has raised foreign sales from $50m. to S300m. annually, or from 10 to 25 per cent. of its total revenues, and it hopes to lift the share to 50 per cent. within the next 10 to 15 years. Dow, moreover, has dared to ven- ture outside pure manufacturing abroad in its determination to establish itself, in the words of its president, Herbert Doan, as \"a truly global company.\" Three years ago, Dow bought a 40 per cent. stake in a small Amsterdam bank, Bankierskantoor Mendes Gans, and last year it opened a bank of its own, Dow Banking, in Zurich. \"We are chemists,\" Doan insists, \"not bankers,\" but through these banks Dow seeks to reduce the complexities of handling money in several different countries and more generally to become a stream lined and globally oriented comr pany in all aspects of its operations; financial as well as manufacturing. There is nothing revolutionary; of course, merely in investing over- seas and, from the late 1950s, I chemicals producers had every in- * centive to do so as excess capacity I and falling prices squeezed profit margins at home. What is more I striking is a stark change of atti- I tude among these companies, many )of which a couple of decades ago I would have regarded exports as Sworth bothering about only if they I fell into their laps. Now, and with San earlier lead from the large American oil companies, many of l them look to becoming worldwide - enterprises \"whose headquarters.\" e as Dow's Doan puts it, \"happen I to be in the United States.\" t The change has been a radical a one. \"For many years,\" recalls . Carbide vice-president George a Wells, \"there was reluctance by - the industry to see any of its tech- v nology exported.\" In fact, chemi- t cal firms still worry their hearts out I, about secret processes, but Wells II points out that their technologies il can also hold promise of raising r living standards in countries less d wealthy than the U.S. The infer- e ence is that some companies, while still primarily profits conscious, are beginning to see themselves as key contributors to a worldwide social revolution and, if their vision has d overtones of \"economic imperial- '* ism,\" transition to the \"multi- Snational\" enterprise could go far it to soothe them. S Requirements g The multinational concept first o attracted notice in the U.S. follow- ts ing publication in the Harvard a Business Review in 1959 of an e article on \"Creating a World r Enterprise\" by Gilbert Clee and n Alfred di Scipio, two senior officials : of the management consulting firm a McKinsey and Co. Refining earlier n ideas, Clee now suggests that to be n truly multinational a company ;h must: market its products wherever e in the world it can do so, to take sy fullest advantage of profit oppor- d tunities; produce them wherever a- necessary to be competitive in all n- major markets; carry out research s, and engineering wherever the best g. technical capabilities are available; y, operate in such a way as to con- r- tribute to the social.and economic s, growth of all countries in which i- it operates: and become, in the final y stages, both internationally man- taged and internationally owned. e When citing examples of the i- companies most geared to multi- y national operations, Clee and other o students of U.S. business still refer is to such European concerns as y Royal Dutch, Philips and Unilever. hEven in the U.S., chemi.il pro- ;e ducers would not be placed at the ,f top of the list and one Harvard le business professor, when asked \" recently if he would consider any n one of them a global entity, re- plied: \"No, but in your country al ICI might.\" Most authorities Is agree, on the other hand, that te the chemical industry is moving y rapidly and some consider that it i. may soon catch up with the li. Europeans. At is Recent Revamp ig International business, for in- ss stance, has traditionally been r- treated at U.S. company head- le quarters as a relatively minor re adjunct to domestic; its effective :y management has been left in an al unco-ordinated fashion to the as foreign subsidiaries. Such com- il. panics as Dow, Carbide and ti- Celanese, however, recently re- ar vamped their parent company organisations in the hope of ensuring that overseas facilities will receive as much attention as those at home. Similarly, a grow- st ing number of companies are w- obtainina European stock exchange rd listings n a bid for wider foreign in ownership, while American Cyana- Id mid boasts that all but six of its id 35 operating subsidiaries abroad ls are now managed by foreign m nationals. er There is little inclination as yet be to appoint foreigners as parent ay company directors and Americans, er who take so much pride in their ke business inventiveness, can be )r- intolerant of foreigners who have 'er different ideas. But, as Clee notes, ill Americans are less hidebound by ch tradition than are Europeans-and. :st of course, with their advanced le; technologies and long experience in- with large-scale operations at home, lic U.S. chemical companies have a ch lot to offer."

U THANT announced to-day that he would not seek re-appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations when his present term of office expires on November 3. He did not close the door entirely, and diplomatic sources here called attention to a key sentence in his statement: \"I have decided not to offer myself for a second term.\" This wording, they suggested, still left open the possibility that U Thant, who has already been urged to continue as UN Secretary- General by most member-Govern- ments, including the U.S., the Soviet Union and Britain, could still be drafted for a second term I From Our Own when the Security Council meets. On the other hand, he also referred to his \"unwillingness\" to stay for a second term and, amid speculation over the past few weeks that U Thant had made up his mind to go, more than a score of names have been mentioned as possible successors. They include Mr. Raul Prebisch. of Argentina, who has been one of the most passionate promoters in the UN of increased economic assistance for developing countries and who is currently Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Among others, meanwhileU who have been mentioned frequently'in Sinformed circles here are three IMexicans: Dr. Luis Padella Nervo, a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and former Mexican Ambassador to the UN: Mr. Alfonso Garcia Robles. deputy Mexican Foreign Minister and at one time a director in the Political and Security Affairs Department at the UN; and Mr. r Francesco Cuevas Cancino, who is the present Mexican Ambassador at the World Organisation.

   "text_content" : "PROGRESS AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS The 2nd Annual General Meeting of Nonwest Costruction Holdings Limited was held on September 1 In Liverpool, Ms. N. H. LaMARs (the Chairman) preiding. The following is an extract from his circulated statement: The year has been one of the most difficult I can recall Costs, many of them directly attributable to Government action. increased at an unprecedented rate, competition intensified and the weather, particularly over the winter period, was the wettest for many years. That the Group achieved a satisfactory result is mainly attributable to the success of our pipeline and housing divisions and to the loyalty and hard work of employees at all levels. Trading Profit before taxation amounts to Â£412,534 and compares closely with the profits of 1964165. including Roberts & Slots Limited. In the opinion of the Directors, the trading results for the year would have justified a small increase in dividend but in order to conform to the Government's request the Board propose a final dividend of 9%, making a total of 15% for the year same). To meet the general rise in overheads being experienced by the Industry many companies are striving to increase turnover and are accepting contracts at uneconomic margins. I have no doubt that this \"buying\" of work by unrealistic pricing is a mistake. Profit is essential if the Industry is to provide itself with modem plant and equipment on which increasing efficiency depends. I had hoped to forecast that the profits for 1966/67 would be maintained at a level not less than achieved in 1965/66, but the Government has just announced a new \" package \" of deflationary measures which are bound to have adverse effects on the contracting industry. Your Board will do its best. The report and accounts were adopted. II r NORWEST CONSTRUCTION HOLDINGS BAMBERGERS The 18th annual general meeting of Bambergers Limited was held on September 1 in London, MR. C. D. WOODBUIRN-BAMBERGER (Chairman and Managing Director) presiding. The following is an extract from his circulated statement: The consolidated profit for the year ended 31st March, 1966 amounts to Â£447,209 (Â£557,932). The ordinary dividend during the year amounted to 10d. (10d.). The gross dividend is covered 1.4 times and retentions amounted to Â£135,923 (Â£138,514). Cash Flow is Â£214,721. The year under review was our third best and this in spite of the difficulties in trying to interpret various differing Government poli- cies with particular reference to the building industry. There has been a build-up of stocks of Softwood as I forecast last year. Although we ourselves were not heavily committed, when stocks generally in the country are overdone conditions become com- petitive and margins suffer. The Hardwood market proceeded cautiously and trading generally was reasonably rewarding. The distribution of panel pro- ducts has been buoyant-despite the Temporary Charge on Imports. This would seem to bear out my contention that it was a foolish miistake on the part of Government to make these raw materials subject to the Charge. Our Builders' Merchant com- panies made good progress and still continue fairly active trading and our manufacturing division is fully employed in making Pallets and Cases.

Ltd.. the chairman, referring to current prospects, said: New and costly taxes and levies have to be borne and it still remains to be seen whether confidence has been so bruised as to cause a major reces- sion. Whereas sales up to now have been a little ahead of the same period a year ago margins are suffering and profits are less easy to earn. The report was adopted.

   "text_content" : "Powell Duffryn Main subsidiaries again do well despite unfavourable economic climate The Amnnal General Meeting was held on Thursday September lit. Following are extracts from the Statement of the Chairman, Sir Henry Wilson Smith, K.C.B., K.B.E. For the Powell Duffryn Group, 1965/66 marked the first interruption since 1959/60 in the upward trend in the total of Group profits before tax, though a substantial proportion of the fall was due to a not unexpected reduction in trade investment income. When we prepared our detailed trading forecasts for the year under review, there were all the signs that the going would be more rugged and the earnings of higher total profits more difficult. Nevertheless, the over. all picture revealed by these forecasts indicated that the upward trend would continue. This was borne out by our actual figures for the first six months. However, the second half year and, most of all the final three months, revealed the adverse swing which pulled the profits for the full twelve months below those of the previous year. It is of course true that the general economic climate was far from favourable, not only to us but to many other sec- tions of British industry. The various restrictive measures promulgated by the Government had a generally dampening effect as well as applying a specific brake to certain of our activities, for example those connected with the building and construction industries, The only noticeable growth factor in 1965 was in wages and other costs. Within the Group, the three main subsidiary companies- Stephenson Clarke, Corralls, and Cory Brothers-wore again responsible for the bulk (in fact just over 70%) of our trad- ing income-i.e. trading profits plus trade investment income, Taken together, they showed a decrease of about Â£120,000 but as half of this was accounted for by a fall in trade in- vestment income, trading profits were only marginally down on 1964/65. This meant not only that the Group's major activities in the spheres of shipping, coal, and oil, fortified wa they wore by the fructification of recent capital investment, held up well, but that various of the newer activities on which eaiich of these companies has increasingly embarked pulled their wught. In tie Individual companies, Stephenson Clarke increased its trading profits; those of Corralls were slightly below 1964/65, mainly because of adverno trading conditions in the last three months of the year; Cory Brothers too had a small fall in trading profits which was more than accounted for by the sale in March 1965 of our Canadian businesses, The major fnll In trading profits when compared with the previous year, occurred in the engineering manufacturing companies, While turnover was maintained, and In some products increased. profit margins were heavily aqueezed as the result of rising costs, Working capital requirements, and the consequent financial charges, tend all the time to increase, and special efforts are being made to remedy this situation and to hold it under control. These direct trading problems colnclded with the initial implementation of major policy decisions involving the selection of those engineering products to substitute cash grants on a discriminatory basis for the most likely to be profitable to the Group, the planned re- previous scheme of investment allowances. More recently organisation of production facilities, and the strengthening of we have had the 1966 Budget and, in particular, the Selective management. Even in the early stages, such changes involved Employment Tax which again is based on arbitrary dis- some disruption and additional cost. The engineering group crimination. also had to meet the pioneering expenses arising from the I find this philosophy of discrimination not only unjusti.

A manufactured companies in future, article Is useless until it is distributed to a customer; various The timber companies also showed a decline in trading profits, forms of manufacture are a mockery of national interest This was hardly surprising. The previous year had produced while many forms of distribution are vital to the national record profits which, with the cyclical nature of the timber economy. trade, would not have been easily repeated in even favour- able conditions. Conditions were in fact distinctly unfavour- able. Government restrictions bit heavily in this sphere (particularly in the latter part of the year), prices weakened, and stock problems arose. Results of other timber companies reveal broadly the same picture and, although there is no virtue in equality of misery, its very existence does at least provide an explanation. We look forward to the reverse, and upward swing. The quarry companies did better than expected and better than in the previous year. In the light of surrounding con. ditions, and especially in view of the deferment of road im- provements, this was gratifying and reflects great credit on the management.

Now they have been replaced by cash grants which will apply to certain activi- ties of this Group but not to others. As distributors of such basic commodities as coal, fuel oil, and timber we are in. volved in heavy capital investment, the expansion and modern- isation of which in all recent years has been encouraged by investment allowances. Now, with the exception of ships, this ceases, I am afraid it is beyond me to explain why. My views on the Selective Employment Tax are, if anything, even stronger. The adopted jargon about a tax on \"services\" (suggesting luxurious frivolities) ought not to be allowed to disguise the fact that this is amongst other things a tax on distribution. In a mixed manufacturing and distributive Group like ours we are particularly able to assess the question. able nature of the arguments about manpower, I am unaware of any evidence which shows that there is less waste of man. power in manufacturing industry than in other spheres of commercial or industrial activity. Anybody involved in large-scale distribution knows how parsimonious one must be In the usa of manpower, if only because of he small margins and because of the constant corrective o' tlhe forces of competition at the point ol' sale. Although we still await full details, we estimate that the net annual cost of this tax to the Powell Duffryn Group will be at least Â£300,000. Group profits after tax were once more higher than over before, The tax charge is substantially reduced, reflecting as it does Corporation Tax at 40% and tax relief from invest. mont allowances of more than Â£250,000. Moreover, we were able to take advantage of the transitional provisions of the 1965 Finance Act and to pay before the end of the tax year an interim dividend of 11% in place of the previously existing pattern of an interim of 3% followed by a final of 8%. This resulted in a non-recurring tax saving of about Â£400,000. As was forecast in their announcement ol the roeults for the first six months and of the special Interim dividend, the directors are nut recommending any increased distri- bution by way of a final dividend. It must be remembered tluht, at present levels of taxation, a total dividend of 11 %, when paid gross with the tax accounted for to the Inland Revenue, will now cost Â£1,320,000-an increase of Â£550,000 over the cost of the same dividend if paid net under the previously existing system. We are fortunate in that even at the, as I hope temporarily, reduced level of 1965/66 profits and ignoring any benefits from investment allowances (or cash grants) a gross dividend of 11% would still be covered about Sj times by profits after tax. The net cash position of the Group was in overdraft to the extent of just under Â£1 million at the date of the balance sheet. This, while somewhat tighter than it was twelve months earlier, remains tolerable. Cash flow, made up of depreciation and retained profits, was rather more than Â£3,300,000. Capital expenditure, cash >)sts of acquisitions, and in. creased needs for working capital required in the year approximately Â£4,000,000. Your board is keeping a close watch on the relationship between these two figures and is being increasingly selective in its capital investment decisions, without in any sense running away from proposals for sound investment. With the varied and widespread activities of the Powell Duffryn Group it is virtually impossible to be specific about short term prospects, and with the general uncertainties now afllicting the United Kingdom economy and wlih the drastic deflationary measures recently announced by the Government, the background is far too obscure for a venture into prophecy. It is too early to say what the final impact of the prolonged seamen's strike will be on the results of the current financial year, not least because we shall strain every effort to catch up on business lost during the strike.

The following is his circulated statement: The Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 2nd April 1966, now pre- sented to you show that the surplus on trading is Â£403,400, as com- pared with Â£590,593 for the 53 weeks ended 3rd April 1965. It has been a very difficult year and I would like to thank my col- leagues and all our staff and employees, both at home and over- seas, for their valued and intensi- fied efforts on the Company's behalf. The half yearly Interim State- ment issued by the Board in Janu- ary 1966 informed you that the turnover of the SERVIS WASH- ING MACHINE DIVISION for the first half year showed a reduc- tion of 25% over that of the same period of the preceding year. I am pleased to report that the second half year brought a slight improve- ment and the sales for the year now show a reduction of only 19%. This reflects a better performance than the national average of the Washing Machine Industry. As regards the future, your Company is making every effort to improve its share of the market.

WRIatoro (chairman and manag- ing director) presiding. The following, is an extract from his circulated statement: As I stated in my interim an- nouncement in March, the profits are less than those for the previous year when record figures were re- ported but, nevertheless, although Sdisappointing, they may be con- sidered reasonably satisfactory Swhen related to those of the year before and earlier years. The sales of the Kitchen Division now wholly centred at the Wal- thamstow Factory were maintained and the automatic finishing process which was installed for the DECPOL Polyester finish is now s realising benefits but manufactur- i. ng costs and overheads continue to rise steeply and, by the nature of our business in a very competitive market, most of these have had Sto be absorbed. The total sales of the Group for Sthe year were slightly less than Sthose for the previous year e although the Kitchen Division showed an increase even when re- r strictions imposed on the building industry had begun to take effect. In the first three months of the cur- rent financial year the total sales were practically the same as for the Scorresponding three months last . year. It is difficult to predict the future trend as costs continue to rise and c profit margins remain under con- siderable pressure. In the Kitchen SDivision, depending as we do on the building industry, the con- tinuing lack of confidence in the Government's intentions exhibited by the builders and the difficulty b of prospective house purchasers in obtaining mortgages, suggest that Sbusiness is not going to be easy. The year's trading resulted in a group profit of Â£185.904 which ' after making provision for Depre- Sciation, Directors' and Auditors' Sremuneration, totalled Â£110,403 \" against Â£191,019 last year. After y making provision for Corporation n Tax at the rate of 40% and adjust- ment for previous taxation provi- sions no longer required the final result is a net profit for the group C of Â£86,426 against Â£107,458 last Syear. In order to take advantage of r the taxation provisions of the C Finance Act 1965 an interim divi- it dend of 22%% subject to Income STax, and which was the same as t the total for last year, was paid n on the 4th April, 1966.

   "text_content" : "The Seventy-seventh Annual General Meeting of John Sadd & Sons Limited was held on Septem- ber 1, at Maldon. Ma. JoHN G. SADD (Chairman and Joint Manag- ing Director) presiding. The following are extracts from his circulated Statement for the year ended March 31, 1966:- A year ago I was able to report that the Company had achieved record sales, the highest ever profit and a peak of efficiency. This year I can claim that the Company has maintained its high degree of efficiency and record sales, but it has not been possible to maintain the same level of profit. PROFITS AND DIVIDENDS: Group Sales were marginally greater than for 1964/65. Wages, Salaries and other costs rose, in some cases, sharply. Competition was keen throughout the whole of the year and part of the increase in costs had to be borne by the Group. The resulting profit of Â£261,697 before charging taxation is, in my opinion, a very satisfac- tory result in view of the adverse trading conditions operating for the whole of the period. The contribu- tions to Group Profits made by the various activities were: 1965/66 1964/65 Manufactured Woodwork 49% 46% Timber Merchants 33o% 34% Builders' Merchants 18% 20% The Board is recommending a final dividend of 7% making a total distribution of 27% to com- pare with the dividend of 27% and bonus of 5% made from the excep- tional profits of 1964/65. WOODWORKING DIVIS. IONS: The Joinery Factories at Maldon and Southend stepped up their output during the year, par- ticularly in Kitchen Units which are used in all types of housing, including the High Rise blocks of flats. Our Norwegian type 'Grorud' windows and our Con- tinental type 'Velmik' windows are going out in increasing quanti- ties and the sales prospects for these three items are good. MALDON WOODWORK LIMITED: The manufacture of television and radio cabinets has contributed a record profit for the Sund review and we have a order book and ood preppect for the roaninder o this year. FLUSH DOOR DIVISIONs The profitability of this Division has still to be improved. The addi- ' tional factory areas which have been provided are now resulting in higher sales, and increased profit. ability should follow. Here. again, the order book is satisfactory. DISTRIBUTION: With the fall. ing off in the activity of the build- ing trade particularly by the builders of houses as a speculation, sales on the distribution side have been harder to come by despite the strenuous efforts of our sales staff to obtain a 'larger slice of a smaller cake'. SOFTWOOD DIVISION: The Division is working well and its facilities would enable it to take more business in sawn softwood; the Sawmill however, has been running to capacity on a weekly 40 hours basis with some overtime working in addition. BUILDERS MERCHANTS DIVISIONS: Sales remain at a high level despite the shortage and high price of copper. The Direc- tors have in mind the urgent need to rehouse our Hardware and Wholesale Ironmongery side and Splans are being made with this in mind as soon as the time is appro- , t priate. k FUTURE PROSPECTS: The writing of this Statement follows Simmediately on the Government's Sadditional restrictions announced on the night of Wednesday, 20th SJuly, and there is no means of knowing to what extent the Com- pany is going to be adversely affected. Throughout 1965 and up to the time of writing, there has been an acute shortage of labour, particularly skilled labour, in Maldon and district, and it has only been possible to maintain the Srecord level of activity by dilution Swith unskilled labour and the provi- * sion of mechanical aids of great variety. Higher interest rates will cut into the Company's profit- ability, as will the increased cost of petrol, derv. telephones and, indeed, the rise on all expenses. The opportunity to obtain in- creased prices seems remote, quite apart from the legislation now / a proposed. g By reason of its extensive manu- i- facturing operations, the Group d expects a refund under the Selective ,. Employment Tax proposals; the procedure for collecting the Tax will result in a loss of Working SCapital. As no additional credit is to be permitted there will be some r restriction of business by the Com- r pany and its customers, many of h whom are victims of this ill-con- ' ceived tax. This means our valued builder customers will urgently oe need more credit for longer periods n in the future. At the same time, Sour resources will have been :- reduced by the funding of our tax ' )r payments under Selective Employ- ment Tax as well as the accelerated K payment of income tax deducted As from dividends. is The report was adopted.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE HAGUE, Sept. 1. The bilateral negotiations on outstanding claims and future aid between Indonesia and Holland are now approaching what is hoped to be their final phase. On Saturday a high-level Indonesian delegation will arrive here, led by Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX, a member of Indo- nesia's new triumvirate of effective rulers under the figurehead of President Sukarno. rreslieno auKarno. The mission will also include Finance Minister Seda, Trade Minister Ashari, and Industry Minister Yussuf, as well as senior economic affairs official Umardjadi, whose visits to the Hague in June and July this year laid the founda- tion for the agreements it is hoped to conclude next week. London Visit The Dutch negotiators will be led by the Foreign Minister, Dr. Josef Luns. They include Finance Minister Vondeling. Economics Minister D. E. N. Uyl, Develop- ment Aid Minister Bot, and Foreign Vice-Minister Van der Stoel. The Indonesians will leave again on September 8 on their way to London. The two countries' positions on Holland's outstanding claims have been narrowed down very consider- ably since the beginning of Mr. Umardjadi's June visit. These claims come under four main headings:- 1-Compensation for the takeover of Dutch companies by the Indo- nesians, mainly in the late 1950s; 2-Losses suffered by private Dutchmen who were forced to leave the country-the smallest item, esti- mated at some Â£9m., for which com- pensation may ultimately be paid in full; 3-Dutch State loans granted to Indonesia since the latter achieved in- dependence in 1949; 4-Financial arrangements which formed part of the transfer of sovereignty in 1949. Together these four categories amounted to something approaching Â£500m. In view of Indonesia's com. plete incapacity to pay anything at all for years to come, coupled with the Dutch Government's desire to give the Indonesians under their new regime some urgently needed help and, in doing so, to start with a clean slate, the Dutch this summer decided to reduce their total claim under all headings to Â£125m. Further bargaining has brought this demand down to about Â£90m., while Indonesia's original counter-proposal of Â£25m. has since been raised un- officially to about Â£60m. It is a reasonable guess that the two delega- tions will strike a bargain at around Â£75m. next week. 20-Year Term? Indonesia will probably not be required to start repayment for five to ten years, after which she will have at least another 10 years in which to pay off her debt. Provided agreement is reached, the Dutch Government is likely to announce short-term aid measures immediately. Later this month all Indonesia's main creditor nations are planning to meet in Tokyo to discuss \"a general rescheduling\" of their respective claims on Indonesia, which total just over $4.000m. This meeting, which is being arranged on the initiative of the Japanese. will probably be attended by British. American. Austra- lian. French and Dutch officials, and possibly others. Russia is being invited but may refuse to take part.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent PARIS, Sept. 1. LA COMPAGNIE Fermibre de Vichy, France's oldest and most celebrated natural mineral water producer, is to pass under the con- . troL-of its biggestcompetitor, the Perrier-Contrexeville group. At present Vichy is controlled by Brasseries et Glacieries d'lndochine in which Perrier has a minority interest. The Perrier group is to surrender its share in BGI to the other main shareholders, Financibre de Suez and Banque de L'lndochine, and will in return receive BGI's majority holding in the Vichy company. With an output of some 500m. bottles of mineral water a year between them Perrier and Contrexc- ville are neck and neck with the other large producer, Evian. The addition of Vichy's annual produc. tion of 250m. bottles will put the enlarged group well into the lead. PARIS, Sept. 1. The Perrier group has considerable outside interests in the manufacture of chocolate and sweets. But the main interest of its new acquisition is the fact that Vichy's distribution subsidiary has an effective monopoly of French exports of mineral water. Milch Cow The Vichy estate is still Govern. ment property on which the Vichy company is only a leaseholder, and its exploitation has proved a verit. able milch cow for the French State. Last year the company paid over Frs.2.8m. (Â£200.000) either to the State or to the town of Vichy, in the form of royalties, property tax, turn. over tax, salary tax, and tax on hetting at the casino. When the present lease expires in 1970. it is expected that the new convention will impose a slightly lighter tax burden on the Vichy company.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent BONN. Sent 1. A SPECIAL meeting of the Defence Committee of the West German Parliament was being held to-day to consider the crisis in the leadership of the armed forces, and the possibility of reforming the organisation of the Federal Defence Ministry. Herr von Hassel, the Minister, and two of the three generals who resigned last week, General Heinz Trettner. formerly Military chief of the Bundeswehr and Lieutenant- General Werner Panitzki. who was head of the Luftwaffe, were giving their versions of the affair to the Committee. The Social Democratic members of the Committee were demanding nothing less than the resignation of the Minister, and even Herr von Hassel's own party, the Christian Democratic Union, has not given him a clean bill. Although the CDU has supported the Minister's decision to accept the resignation of the Generals, it has not denied the fact that the Ministry has been found wanting. It seems possible that Herr von Hassel's State Secretary, Herr Gumbel, will be sacrificed in the impending shake-up. One of the proposals, made by a CDU member of the Defence Com- mittee is that the Defence Ministry should be demoted to the role of a purely service ministry, while the Defence Council which is a Commit- tee of the Cabinet, under the super- vision of a Minister, Dr. Heinrich Krone, should take over defence planning, NATO affairs, and military and civil defence. Herr von Hassel has consistently refused to accept any blame for the crisis, and to-day repeated his criti- cism of the Generals, particularly of General Panitzki, whom he accused of failing to get to grips with the Starfighter problem. The only mistake the Minister has admitted is that he did not pension off General Panitski earlier. After hearing the reports of the Minister and the Generals, the De- fence Committee was investigating the crash of a Starfighter into the North Sea in July, an incident which is believed to illustrate particularly vividly the inadequacies in West Germany's sea-rescue organisation.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Madrid Correspondent HOW TO KEEP aloft in a com- petitive market is being demon- strated by Construcciones Aero- nauticas SA (CASA), one of the very few Spanish companies in the aircraft manufacturing business. The CASA story is also a lesson to other Spanish enterprises on the importance of having a wideawake management and an open door policy when crossing the Pyrenees for business. Despite the fact that one-third of CASA's equity is held by the State-controlled INI indus- trial holding organisation, the com- pany's open door policy last year mduced the American Northrop to acquire a 24 per cent. participation in CASA. The deal has already borne fruit. Backed by its American partner, CASA has clinched a Ptas.3,682m. (about Â£24.1m.) contract with the Spanish Air Ministry for the pro- duction of 70 Northrop F-5 one- and two-seater fighters. The Span- ish-built aircraft are 18 per cent. cheaper than the similar American product. Northrop, for its part, gets licensing fees and, in addition to CASA dividends, a profit on parts and pieces-about 50 per cent. of the value of the finished aircraft. More and more of the pieces and parts will, of * course, be built locally in the future, but mean- while the Americans are showing healthy profits. Civil War The story of CASA is basically that of keeping up with its rivals across the border by hard work and constant shopping around for manufacturing licences. Established in 1922 with a capital of only Ptas.l.5m., production was started on 20 Breguet XIX planes sold to the Spanish Air Force at a price of Ptas.36,000 each (about Â£215 at to-day's rate of exchange), not in- cluding the engine. With the first job satisfactorily completed, a total of 450 aircraft were eventually produced in additioj to several commercial Breguet 26 and Grand Raids built under French licence. Meanwhile, an agreement was signed with the German Dornier which led to the building of 31 Air Force and commercial aircraft and one Super Wal for trans- Northrop F.5 a\"\" w~ w yU ma .- a- u.-.- aggu~elv juutm rr o w atlantic flights. This was followed in 1931 by a licensing agreement with the British Vickers for the production of 27 torpedo planes for the Spanish Navy, followed later by Avro and Hawker licences. The outbreak of the Civil War sent CASA on another shopping tour to Germany, where, at the end of 1937, licence agreements were signed with Heinkel, Bucker and Gotha. With the company's main plant at Getafe (Madrid) controlled by the Republican Government, production had to start from scratch in a new plant at Seville. Additional difficulties were encountered in 1939 when CASA was practically cut off from German supplies. However, dark as the situation seemed at first sight for CASA, it had the advantage that the com- pany was now forced to stand on its own feet and manufacture all the parts and pieces needed for the over 1,400 aircraft which were built under German licence in the following years. The operation was so successful that some of the old three-engined Junkers are still buzzing around in the blue skies of Castile. This apparently im- pressed the Germans because new co-operation agreements were ruarop r- i- Id signed later for the building of the s it Dornier-27 and development of the le HBF-320 Hansa. !9 To keep wheels spinning during e d the doldrums, CASA also i sr embarked on the manufacture of Ir light alloy structures for railway , i8 carriages and buildings with such t ,e success that gross income from this ti ts sector increased from 25 per cent. .r in 1955 to 40 per cent. six years 's later. The blockade during the ( j) Civil and the World War also led r L\" CASA to create its own design / i office and, on request by the Air r s Ministry, the company produced c n three transport prototypes, the a n C201 Alcotan, the C202 Halcon S and the C207 Azor for 10, 14, 30- r ,n 40 passengers, respectively. t it Meanwhile, CASA had expanded ( n- its plants at Madrid, Getafe, Seville r on and Cadiz to cover a total of 4 LI about 130,000 square metres and t employ over 4,500 workers. It was at this stage that American interest was first aroused. Under \"inspect and repair as necessary\" contracts signed with the USAF be- tween 1954 and 1957. CASA over the years has handled a steady stream of C-47s, over 500 Sabre- jets and some 1,400 Supersabres. In 1960 the Seville plant began the same work with T-33 training air- craft, while the Cadiz plant started repairing H-19 helicopters for the Spanish Navy and the USAF. The Getafe plant, in 1961, started work on the USAF T-28 Trojan trainer and the C-130 Hercules be- sides doing overhaul and major repair work on the F-102 Delta Dagger and the F-104 Starfighter. Space Research A technical assistance agreement was signed with North American Aviation and \"as we do a good job and cheaper than anybody else in the business.\" a CASA official says, \" we can beat our competitors whenever the Americans invite tenders for new contracts.\" But CASA is not putting all its eggs into one basket, and despite its good relations with the Americans, the company has again sent its scouts across the Pyrences to look at other projects. This time France attracted the com- pany's attention, and after a pro- longed study of the situation. CASA engineers have now returned with a French Sud Aviation contract for missile and rocket heads and pieces and parts of satellites. They also secured an agreement to co-operate with Sud Aviation in European space research programmes. This con- tract opens a new future for CASA, or, as one of the engineers, put it: \" If Charles the Great decides to go to the moon, he will be riding on one of our rockets.\"",

NEGOTIATIONS for a possible technical co-operation are being car- ried out by Blohm and Voss, the Hamburg shipyard, and Siemens, the West German electrical concern. In a statement published by Blohm and Voss it was emphasised that the shipbuilding and engineering interests of the yard and the interests of the electro-technical concern are comple- mentary to one another in many fields. It may, however, be sometime before the results of the negotiations are known. No comment was given on reports that the negotiations may eventually lead to capital links as well.

   "text_content" : "The Annual General Meeting of MANNESMANN AG was held in DUsseldorf on July 14, 1966. The following are extracts from the address by DR. EOON OVERBECK, Chairman of the Board of Direc- tors, and details of the report presented by the Board: DR. OVERBECK Commenting first on certain salient points of the past business year, DR. OVERBaCK referred to the recession in coal and steel, two main sectors of the company's activities. Coal was Germany's only secure major source of energy requiring no foreign currency expenditure. The German steel in- dustry was a large consumer of domestic coal, but compared with Its foreign competitors using U.S. coal, It had to bear a cost penalty of some DM 12 to DM 15 per ton. It was in the common interest that the steel Industry should be pre- served as the coal industry's cus- tomer: therefore aid should be provided, allowing the German steel Industry to buy domestic cok- ing coal at the same prices is Imported U.S. coal. The situation for steel. DR. OVeBRICK said was quite different; while demand for coal would eventually settle down at a constant level, world steel consumption would continue to rise. In the face of the rapid advance In stool making techniques, steel producers had to make large investments to remain cometitive, MANNES. MANN would complete most of its DM S00m. steel works invest- ment plan this year, leaving only the commissioning of the larne continuous casting plant for 19W6. Prom then on, the company would concentrate production of pig Iron and crude steel practically in a single locality. It would have an integrated processing line extending from pig iron to finished products based on 3m, tons of crude steel annually, Incronilna emphnsis would be glien to the manufac- ture of quality stools. The share of tuhes and tubular products in the consolidated MANNESMANN companies' turn- over rose further during 1965. with high quality tubes selling particu- larly well. Other processing sectors also developed favourably. In fact in the past year, which saw a simultaneous recession in coal and rolled steel, the company really felt the benefits of its broadly based activities. Turning to exports, DR, Oven- BECK said the overall 1965 figure of DM 955m. could have been exceeded if contracts offered at unsatisfactory prices had been accepted. Deliveries to the Eastern bloL declined slightly and ac- counted for 8.R per cent of lotil MANNESMANN exports. Busi- ness with North America was almost doubled and exports to the EFTA countries rose much more sharply than those to the EEC. Dealing with the current business year, DR, OVERRRCK reported a 2.6 per cent increase for the first six months in the consolidated com- panies' domestic customer sales, but a decline In exports. Sales of coal, rolled steel and tuhe rounds and inunts were lower, but those of tubes and tubular nrodricts and products of other processing showed Increases ns 4,7 per cent and 6,3 per cent respectively. The following are details from the report: TURNOVER The 1965 business year saw an expansion In the MANNES. MANN group's turnover for rolled steel, tubes and products of other processing, but a decline in coal sales. External group turn- over for the first time exceeded DM 4,000m. The financial results deteriorated compared with the previous year, mainly as a result of rises In wages and salaries, material prices and other costs, accompanied from the middle of the year onwards by a price recession for rolled steel and iuhes reflecting stiffer domestic ..A F-1.en nmme ln - nl92-1 .. rationalisation measures only partly offset these adverse factors. External turnover of MANNES- MANN AG and all domestic and foreign companies, in which it has a holding of 50 per cent or more, totalled DM 4,160m.. a 5.7 per cent increase over 1964. The consolidated German MANNESMANN companies re- corded an overall turnover of DM 4.321m., of which external sales accounted for DM 3.363m.. or 5.4 per cent more than in 1964. The external turnover expansion of the German group companies was larmely due to higher exports. Domestic deliveries increased by only 2.8 per cent to DM 2,455m. hut exports went up by 13.1 per cent to DM 908m, The export share of external sales therefore improved to 27 per cent from 25.1 per cent In 1964. Rolled steel exports showed a rise of app, 54 per cent par. tlcularly reflectlng higher deliveries of hot rolled strip, plate and sheet, while tube exports advanced by about 14 per cent. When export sales are broken clown into main product groups, rolled steel and tuhe roundt and ingots show a sharp rise to 32.6 per cent from 24.3 per cent previously, with tubhe and tuhular products also hiuhcr at 30,5 per cent Total turnover of the foreign MANNESMANN companies rose In 1965 to DM 616m. from DM 554m. In the previous year. External sales advanced by 8.4 per cent to DM 450m, PERSONNEL The labour force of MANNPF.S MANN AG and Its German sub. sidiaries deolined in 1965 by 1,530 to 69,915. mainly heciuse of the reduction in the number of coal miners. The foreign subsidiarles showed a decline in manpower hv 686 to 7,51H Expendlture on wages and salaries by the consolidatod MANNESMANN group rose In 1965 to DM 682.8m. from DM 636.4m. in the previous year. PROFIT AND DIVIDEND After an appropriation of DM 10m, to the Free Reserve and including the balance brought for. ward from the previous year, net profit for 1965 amounted to M 59.089.822.86. The Annual General Meeting resolved to dis- tribute a dividend of 10 per cent, equivalent to DM 58,123,030,75, and to carry forward the resulting balance of DM 966,792.11.

RECENT confiscations and deci- sions by the Congo Government have cost the Belgian Government over Â£4m., according to a statement made to-day by the Foreign Minis- ter, M. Pierre Harmel. He added that Belgium cannot agree to meeting from its national Budget charges imposed upon it by the unilateral acts of a foreign Government. Though an inter- Government conference is being pre- pared. the Congo President. General Mobutu, has refused to allow his Government's actions to be discussed. One of the acts complained of was the seizure of the assets and blocking of the accounts of the Bel- gian Social Security Institute in the Congo. This left it to be the Belgian Government to meet the Institute's pension and other liabilities from other funds. The other was the re. pudiation of the World Bank loan to OTRACO, the Government trans- port organisation which had been contracted since the Congo's indepen- dence but under Belgian guarantee. The Minister said he still hoped for a well prepared inter-Governmental discussion but he did not forecast the date. He said however that he pro- posed treating Belgium's technical aid to the Congo as outside politics. The aid appropriation, of which 60 per cent. goes to the Congo, will be the same in 1967 as this year-Â£13m. from the budget and Â£2.9m. from the national' lottery. The Minister added that Belgium has no wish for political ascendancy or finance monopoly in the Congo. He hinted that relations might be easier if Belgium's aid provisions were channelled through international organisations and if other countries and organisations took part",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent ZURICH, Sept. 1. ACCORDING to a report issued by the Federal Customs Directorate in Berne. Switzerland's trade deficit was only Sw.Frs. 214.3m. (Â£18m.) in July, or 18.3 per cent. down on the figure of Sw.Frs. 262.4m. recorded for the same month last year. Despite this improvement, the increase rate for Swiss exports-7.3 per cent. above the value for the corresponding 1965 month-was the lowest yet this year, and also lower than .the increases recorded for the month of July over the past three years. At the same time the expansion rate for imports accelerated, values for July of this year being, up by 2.5 per cent. on those for July, 1965. Absolute values were of Sw.Frs. 1,206.1m. for exports and Sw.Frs. 1.420.4m. for imports. Exports to the U.K. were consider. ably below the level for July, 1965, at Sw.Frs. 80.2m. (Sw.Frs. 89.9m.), while imports from the U.K. rose to Sw.Frs. 118m. (Sw.Frs. 99.2m.).",

O.B.E., J.P. (the Chairman), presi- dinhe following is an extract from his circulated statement: The profits have increased from Â£308.253 to Â£329.355 which Is an increase of Â£21,102 The net profit, after deducting Â£135,000 Corpora- tion Tax levied at 40% and Â£12,344 Income Tax and Profits Tax is Â£182,011 compared with Â£122,192 for the previous year. It must be pointed out that a profit of Â£64,000 was made on stocks held at April 1965 following the Duty increase. This compares with a stock profit of Â£34,800 in April 1964. The percentage profits earned by Wholesale and Retail trading on Tobacco and Cigarettes have been appreciably reduced as a result of the new prices introduced in April 1965. Your directors recommend a Final Dividend of 8% making a total of 16% (same). The Group increased its Retail interests by purchasing a further four Retail shops, three of these selling Newspapers. In the interests of administration, the Parent Com- pany purchased from its Subsidiary Peter B. Harris Limited five Retail shops in Huddersfield and one in Manchester. In the Wholesale trade, the Group has made steady progress and the modernisation of Whole- sale Warehouses is showing good results. The swing from Non-Filter Tipped cigarettes to Filter Tipped cigarettes will obviously limit the increase in Turnover. The Pay Roll Tax will mitigate against the profits of the Group, as it is essentially involved in a service industry. The full effects of this. however, are not yet clear. Your Company will continue with its policy of re-building and re-organising its freehold properties so that the best use can be made of them. The report and accounts were adopted.",

   "text_content" : "The Reed Paper Group is now half-way to achieving full production with its trailing blade paper coating plant (shown here) installed at Imperial Paper Mills at Gravesend last October at a cost of Â£2m. Some 25,000 tons of Trueblade coated paper is being produced annually and next year it is expected that the full 50,000 tons will be achieved. The coater, which itself cost nearly Â£280,000, has a speed of 2,500 feet a minute. From last October to December the plant was occupied on trial runs for various grades, substances and web sizes, and these culminated in the first commercial order which was for the Woman's Realm pattern book. \" Trueblade needs a large market to justify the expenditure and to absorb the paper at the frightening speed at which it is produced.\" Mr. W. F. Amies. a director of Reed Paper Group, said yesterday. He was confident that the \"economic prices\" of Trueblade would enable it to compete favourably with foreign papers despite the imminent removal of both the import surcharge and EFTA tariffs. There is a labour force of about 1.200 at Imperial Mills and it is gradually turning over from three-shift to four-shift working in line with other mills in the country. This allows continuous working and a man's week is reduced from 46 hours to 44 with no overtime. It is estimated that with the reduced week and compensating payments for the change, earn- ings rise by about 41 per cent. The changeover is being controlled by customer demand and availability of labour to recruit for the new shift. So far 400 employees are on the new system and 100 more will go over in September. The company says this is not \"breaking the pay freeze\" because the agreement covering the change was drawn up last year. Mr. Amies stated that this had been confirmed by the Ministry of Labour.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspondent The Prime Minister yesterday called the first Cabinet meeting since Parliament rose for the summer recess to discuss the problems facing the Government next week at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference and the Trades Union Congress. It was learned afterwards that the agenda for the Common wealth Prime Ministers' conference occupied the bulk of the three-hour discussion. The broad lines of Government policy at the conference have now been settled and no further Cabinet meet- ing is expected before next Tuesday. There are signs that. the disclosure by the Conservative Leader, Mr. Heath. earlier this week of assurances given to him by the Prime Minister has embar- rassed the Government in the critical period before the Com- monwealth Prime Ministers meet. \" Adjourned \" Mr. Heath announced that accord- ing to the Prime Minister the talks between otticials in Salisbury had been adjourned rather than broken off and could therefore be resumed at any time. This has given the more militant African leaders a further excuse for mistrusting British motives over Rho- desia and those Ministers concerned with Commonwealth allairs expect to face a series of hitter denunciations of U.K. policy next week. Bit despite tlie expected pressure for much tougher action aapinst the illetgl regime in Salisbury it is emphasised in Whitehall that the Government hias no intention of changing its policy. Any call for force will be firmly resisted and Ministers will insist that the Rhodsioa problem must remain the responsibility of Britain rather than either the Commonwealth or the United Nations. Also high on the Cabinet's agenda was the attitude to he taken by the Prime Minister 'at the TUC confer. ence itt Blackpool on Monday, when Mr. Wilson will attempt to persuiade the unions to accept the Govern- ment's voluntary wages freeze. There is little doubt that the Prime Minister plans to make an excep tionally tough speech and he will warn the delegates that refusal to accept the Government's policy will inevitably bring nearer the day when the compulsory powers in Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act may have to be used. Eight Ministers still on holiday were absent from the Cabinet. Among non-Cahinet Ministers called in was Mr. Kenneth Robinson. Minister of Health. who reported on his efforts to meet the grievances of doctors over the pay freeze. After the Cabinet Mr. Wilson went to Transport House for a meeting of olficers of the Labour Party National Executive called to discuss the organ- isation of this year's party conference, which takes place at Brighton from October 3 to 7.

   "text_content" : "4 L ,,WbyL J L ELSBETH GANGUIN by ELSBETH GANGUIN \" suppose our prime func- tion is to be available,\" the personnel officer replied, having mulled over my question for a minute or two. He was one of half a dozen people whose full-time concern is the 2,200 men and women employed at the Distillers Company's sac- tory site at Barry in South Wales, where I had gone to see what personnel work entails in practical terms. The factory, close to the Bris- tol Channel, is part of the Dis- #:it ikm , l n, I l A t;,.s s. a Cr8c cs an. p5 as. c5 enterprise. It houses British Geon (in which Goodrich of U.S. owns a 45 per cent. share) making about 90.000 tons a year of PVC and some 10,000 tons of nitrile rubbers. Then there is British Resin Products, pro- ducing synthetic resins and other plastics materials, and. finally, Distrine (with a balf- share held by Dow Chemicals). manufacturing about 26.000 annual tons of polystyrene. The fourth concern of the site is Distillers Plastics Services. which, as its name implies, pro- vides a common service for the three operating companies, in- cluding personnel administra- tion. Few \"professionals\" As is still customary in much of British industry, one section of this personnel department deals with the affairs of \" staff.\" and another with the affairs of \" labour,\" the 1.400 hourly paid workers manning the factory floor. Few of the personnel men are \" professionals\" in the sense of having entered the field right from the outset of their working lives. Among them are ex-chemists, gin salesmen, public relations experts, and technical service engineers. One staff officer came up from the shop floor, another is a bacterio- logist by origin. The controller of the depart- ment, operating like the rest from a small, bleak, glass- fronted office, concerns himself with high-level questions of staff changes, job evaluations or staff conditions. But it is salary administration which figures very prominently in his day's work. \"There are always a terrific number of queries.\" In fact, \"pre-occupation with salaries fits into everything else you are doing: it always comes down in the end to what you pay a man,\" I was told. I sat down with a staff officer as he went through his morning mail. There were several appli- cations: a very senior chemist, currently working for a com- petitor, was seeking a still more lucrative job: a plastics tech- nologist. a salesman, a female graduate, all wanted to join Distillers. The bundle of letters also included applications turned down by other sections of the group-there is consider- able interchange - and this meant having to write \"letters of regret.\" The Ministry of Labour's Professional and Executive Register was advertising a 62 vear-old translator claiming to know all the languages of the globe. A memorandum asked tor nominations for a training course. Another inquired whether a job could be found for a man who, having failed his degree in mathematics and chemistry, now wanted to try again externally. And while we were looking through the mail, the technical service manager came on the telephone. He wanted the staff officer to help him fill in the forms for a training costing exercise. Throughout the personnel man next door received a suc- cession of callers. \"You have to keep open house.\" he explained, and it's no use trying to introduce an appoint ments system.\" A trainee inquired whether a permanent position had been found for him. A laboratory assistant was worried about his examination results. A third man's problem was the change from shift to day working. \"What does this involve?\", he asked. The draw- ing office manager came to dis- cuss vacancies; the accounts manager queried promotional changes. And 25 minutes were spent appraising a film on critical path analysis, followed by the discussion of a man's \" ambigious\" medical report. and arraneements for a visit to the factory by the Women's Engineering Society. The request for mannina the com- pany stand at a forthcoming technical exhibition demanded an answer. too. Satisfying work All this, I was assured, is thoroughly satisfying work. But it does have its disadvantages as well. \"You rarely manage to tie the parcel up, many times it is a bit of this and a bit of that.\" was one grouse. \"You can become too involved in other people and their pro- blems.\" was another. Throueh his constant availa- bility the effective personnel officer turns into something of a \"catalyst.\" He knows the site. he has access to every section. He knows the com- pany's policy, he knows \"what sort of people our managers are. and what types they want to have working for them.\" It means, in short, that. where line management is confined to its own \"line.\" the personnel officer can inter-act. If anything, \" the hourly paid person gets even more atten- tion than the staff,\" claimed a labour officer at Barry. \"It must be so, because we are operating in accordance with negotiated conditions. For in- stance, we argued for a full 12 months over holidays, whereas the staff would simply be told.\" Getting the workmen, having them medically examined, arranging for their job rating, is one thing-helping them out of personal trouble is another. Just then a man whose wife had run up a debt had to be got out of jail-\" they whipped him in ever so quickly\"-and the company laid out the money. \"They come to us with everything \": rows with super- visors. or with shop stewards- \"here we tell them don't bring management into your com- plaints about a union.\" The men come to discuss abnormal working conditions, shift sys- tems, or holidays. While I was there a process worker was being put right about his \" days off.\" And the labour officers also administer the site's \" process and general workers productivity award scheme.\" with the criterion being stan- dard of work: application to work: co-operation; attention to safety and care of plant and materials, and the rewards ranging from 3d to 8d to be added to the base and job rate. There has not been a strike at Barry yet. Working conditions Throughout the day one job led to another, although for once no job-seekers were scheduled for interview. The staff officer saw 106 candidates during the past 30 weeks, and 55 new graduates during three weeks around Easter. Nor does the personnel work stop at the Barry site. It is, for instance, in London at the group's central personnel department, where personnel policy is formed. (Distillers' chemicals and plastics group employs a total of 7.000 people dispersed over various sites.) In London. too. personnel \"techniques \" are initiated, and from here training courses are administered-the company has a residential training centre at Epsom. Also. the 100 to 130 technical staff who join every year are centrally recruited. Staff development-\" we are trying to look five years ahead for all senior members of the staff\"-and staff records are similarly the domain of the London office, as is keeping tabs on company sponsored university students.",

Roberts, which has been circulated with the Report and Accounts and from his subsequent remarks at the Annual General Meeting held yesterday. INTERIM STATEMENT ACCOUNTS AND TAXATION FUTURE The interim report, issued in accordance with the request of The Stock Exchange, for the first six months of the financial your 1965-66 showed an Increase over the corresponding period of the previous year, but in my review last year I said that It is not easy to make such a report ua informative as it should he because of the seasonal nature of our husinehs. As it turned out there were factors outside our control which adversely affected the second six months, normally by far the busiest time of year. For instance the North East India Tea cropping season came to an early close owing to an unprecedentedly cold autumn; a quantity of tea destined for our warehouses was seized In East Pakistan while in transit from Assam to Calcutta during the hostilities with India; and on 3lit January 1966 there was a wage award which affected the last two months' trading profits of our financlal year. The Accounts for the year are the first to be dealt with under the new form of taxation introduced by the Finance Act 1965, and although Corporation Tax nmounting to Â£186.000 has been provided, the full impact of accounting to the Inland Revenue for income tax on dividends has not been felt ow nL to the transitional reliefs afforded by the above mentioned Act. Some of those reliefs have been withdrawn by this year's Finance Bill and, as a result, the Company will have to account to the Inland Revenue for income tax at Is. 3d, In the Â£ on the final dividend now proposed, 'his amounts to Â£106000 making the total lax liability Â£292,000, while, but for the transiltonal reliefs of which the Company took advantage by paying the Interim dividend, the total tax would have amounted to Â£34.,000 Had the profits borne income tax and profits tax on the old basis the comparable liability would have been Â£244,000.

General de Gaulle to-day lined with Hanoi and called for the withdrawal of all American trooos from South Vietnam within an appropriate and fixed period. Speaking early to-day at Phnom-Penh in neighbouring Cam- bodia, de Gaulle denounced the American presence in South Vietnam as a menace to world peace, and maintained that the only solution to the conflict would be a negotiation leading to the guaranteed neutralisation of South-east Asia. guaranreea ncutransanon or bou Such a vast and difficult negotia- tion, he said, would only be pos- sible after the U.S. had agreed to withdraw from the peninsula. But he did not believe that this was likely to occur soon, if ever. General de Gaulle put forward no other proposals for the end of the Vietnam War, and disclaimed any intention that France should play the part of mediator. But he argued that the participants in a new negotiation should include China, France, Britain, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as the South-east Asian countries themselves. General de Gaulle offset his con- demnation of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam with a number of refer- ences to France's friendship for the U.S. and to the American ideal of self-determination. But he also made it clear that he wished to be taken as the champion of the non- aligned world, claiming that the American presence in South-east Asia was not merely provocative to the Soviet Union, but also disap- proved of by many people in Europe, Africa and Latin America. He cited France's withdrawal from Algeria as an example for virtuous conduct, but he passed over entirely in silence the war waged by France in IndoChina in the 1950's. General de Gaulle's speech was evidently extremely well received by the Cambodians. Prince Sihanouk also violently attacked the U.S. in- volvement in Vietnam. and described General de Gaulle as a modern-Saint George who defends justice, right and peace by courageous political speeches.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correipondent LUSAKA, Sept 1. THE ZAMBIAN Government has been presented with a report on how Zambia can become indepen- dent of power supplies from Rhodesia by construction of a Â£25m. dam and extensive projects on the Zambezi River which separates Zambia from Rhodesia The report is understood to recommend the building of a 13,000 ft. long barrage on the Zamhezi on the Zambian side. It is suggested the barrage should be above the Victoria Falls. and the object is to regulate the flow of water for a new power station which is being hewn out of solid rock on the edge of the river. Livingstone electricity improve- ments, including the construction of a power line from there nearly 300 miles to Lusaka, would involve the expenditure of more than Â£6m. Zambia has decided to abandon the plans contained originally in the Kariba hydro- electric scheme for construction, at a cost of Â£19m.. of a power station on the Zambian bank of the dam. The consultants who produced the report are believed to have stressed the necessity of pushing ahead with the Kafue River and Livingstone projects to avoid the possibility of power supplies becoming inadequate through the abandonment of further Kariba expansion. It is intended that con- tracts will be placed by the middle of this month for preliminary work on the Kafue dam. This project, which includes the transmission line from the dam to Lusaka, will be about 30 miles south of Lusaka, on the Kafue River.",

VERWOERD'S talks in Pretoria to-morrow with Basuto- land's Premier, Chief Leabua Jonathan, is expected here to pro- duce little more than reassurances of South Africa's goodwill. The meeting, which flows from an approach by Chief Jonathan. is expected to be fairly short and completely private, with no British Government representative present. Dr. Verwoerd. who leaves Cape Town to-morrow, is expected to do most of the talking from an ex- tremely broad standpoint Concrete discussions arising from Basutoland's independence on such topics as customs and labour as well as diplomatic representation-are not likely to take place until the tiny British territory gains independence as Lesotho. The tenor of to-morrow's talks will certainly be strongly echoed in Par- liament next week when the Prime Minister's budget vote is debated and observers believe that Dr. Verwoerd will show some gesture of help to fit his expounded policy of being pre. pared to help emergent African states -and, particularly, the territories-if they call on South Africa for assist- ance Some suggestion of help could touch on the Oxbow scheme which, as a possible source of millions of gallons of cheap water for a parched South Africa. is Chief Jonathan's only real bargaining counter. Yet, it is still in the distant future as such factor. It is only a month ago that Chief Jonathan appointed a team of experts to draw up detailed plans which will be ready in March next year. More. over. Dr. Verwoerd has still to hear from his own commission, appointed earlier in the year, to investigate all aspects of South Africa's water resources. So far South Africa has been ex- tremely cautious towards the Oxbow scheme on the grounds that a vital source of water would be under the control of a black state. But it is now being suggested that this fear could be overcome by an Inter- national Commission of Control. with major shareholdinas to Basutoland and South Africa. It seems clear. however, that while Dr. Verwoerd cannot completely commit himself at this stage on the project he would like to give some further indication of his good intentions towards his ideal of a common market of Southern Africa. which would mean a closer link with the three Protecto. rates, once that they are independent, without geographical incorporation as Bantustans."

   "text_content" : "By Our Rio de Janeiro Correspondent NEARLY A year ago Brazilians. for the first time since the tivolu- tionary rdgime of President Cas- tello Branco took power in April. 1964, went to the polls to elect governors in eleven states of the federation. The outcome of these elections abruptly ended a period in which the rdgime, after an initial punitive phase, had attempted to pursue a course in reasonable har- mony with the 1946 constitution; but all this was changed when the electorate in the key states voted against the candidates associated with the revolution, expressing a long-felt dissatisfaction with living conditions that had further de- teriorated under the impact of necessary but unpleasant disinfla- tionary policies. The regime, under attack from its own supporters and particularly from the \"hard-line\" military, tightened the screws and issued a second Institutional Act that gave the President virtually absolute powers to maintain the authority of the revolution and to safeguard the economic reform programme. The policy of the rapid \"redemo- cratisation\" of Brazil was aban- doned, and the popular vote fell into disfavour. No candidates For the elections for governor to take place in the remaining states to-morrow, the revolutionary gov- ernment has decreed very different conditions. This time the elections will be decided by vote of the legis- lative assemblies of 12 individual states, where the regime. through the members of the Government- sponsored party, the National Re- novation Alliance (ARENA). can better determine the course of play, putting its weight behind the can- didates nominated by the ARENA regional conventions. It is not surprising that in these circumstances the opposition in Brazil's two-party system, repre- sented by the so far ineffective Brazilian Democratic Movement, has had a thin time, finally decid- ing not to enter candidates for the gubernatorial elections. Moreover. if President Castello Branco has certainly not used to the full the absolute powers available to him. their impact has nevertheless been sharply felt in recent months.

The federal go ..ime.t's atten- tion was further directed to the North-east when fifteen bishops. led by Dom Helder Camara, Arch- bishop of Recife and a prominent spokesman for liberal Catholicism. issued a manifesto calling for better living conditions for the North- eastern workers and chiding the Government on the grounds of lack of interest in the region.

   "text_content" : "By Our Scientific Correspondent THE MARCONI COMPANY has won a Â£1.lm. order to equip the Swedish Air Force with what is expected to be the most advanced automated weather service so far designed. To be based on two major weather centres, it will be equipped with an undisclosed number of Marconi Myriad high-speed com- puters and supporting equipment to take reports directly from weather ships, ground stations and weather satellites. Some 3m. teleprinter symbols, representing 24 hours of weather reporting, will be handled by the machines without human interven- tion. Teleprinters will be elimi- nated and even the weather maps will be fed directly to the com- puters. Automatic Updated maps will be drawn automatically by digital plotters and this will be the only paper product of the whole operation since forecast will be carried in o-ear characters on tabular dis- plays. If a garbled message is received. or one which for some reason can be dealt with fully by the com- puter, the attention of a duty meteorologist will be drawn to the fact by a display and he will be able to key his interpretation into the computers. The complex programming of the system will be carried out by Marconi in conjunction with Svenska-Radio and the Swedish Air Force Board. This is the fourth major con- tract Marconi has received from the Air Force Board, previous ones having been for radar equip- ment and associated computers. The company has thus raised its sales figure to this one customer to Â£7m. August record for Stone-Platt company Stone Manganese Marine of Greenwich and Birkenhead, a member of the Stone-Platt group, achieved a record of Â£750,000 in export orders, for marine propel. lers during August.

   "text_content" : "By Our Correspondent in The Hague \"THE DUTCH always say they wish more British businessmen would take the time to come over more often.\" That is how a British diplomat sums up local response to British export efforts on the eve of the autumn Utrecht Trade Fair (September 5-13). Only a handful of British firms are exhibiting under their own names here this year. Others are represented by their agents. British partcipation at the two annual Utrecht Trade Fairs \"has never been sufficient,\" according to representatives of the Anglo-Dutch Trade Council in The Hague. The council considers the spring ones the more important because they cover both capital goods and con- sumer goods. Buying fair \"Some British businessmen fail to realise it is not merely an ex- hibition. It is an actual fair where wholesalers buy their stock. The Dutch cannot be blamed for order- ing German or Swedish machinery if there is not any British on dis- play,\" they point out. Ideally, the British Embassy in The Hague would like to have busi- nessmen planning to take part in next spring's fair here contact them now so it can help find suit- able agents who will be able to prepare sales campaigns and exhibit for them. For newcomers the joint ven- ture exhibitions, partially financed by the Board of Trade, are believed to be a good idea by com- mercial specialists. Do they pay? Do fairs and special British Weeks such as the one in Amster- dam in May 1965 pay off in terms of higher sales? British trade specialists are cautiously optimistic about them. \"Our problem is we don't know what would have happened if there hadn't been a ' British Week.' ex- plains tone. \" But we do know that while total British exports to Holland dropped about 4 per cent. in 1965, sales of the consumers goods featured in Amsterdam during the Week shot up by 23 per cent. In some cases such as textiles and jewellery they were nearly 50 per cent. or more.\" (In 1965 total British sales to Holland amounted to Â£176m. corn- pared with Â£183m. the year before; Â£140m. in 1962 and Â£156m. in 1963. Britain's share of the Dutch market has been steadily dropping from a high of 8 per cent. in 1958 to 6.5 per cent. in 1965. The major reason for this decrease is the influence of tariff cutting in the Common Market.) \" What businessmen must realise about these export promotions is that all the Government can do is set the scene. It's up to them to actually sell their goods and follow up the opportunities they encounter,\" a diplomat commented. \"One firm which participated in the British Week went about with a sour face and didn't accom plish anything. Another gave a special 5 per cent. reduction to stores stocking up for it, and in- creased its turnover by 50 per cent.,\" he says. Follow-up But the real test, as far as both the Embassy and the Anglo-Dutch tramu: Council are concerned, is the follow-up. Does the businessman come back nafuue ; to promote his product two months a later? h Our Embassy in The Hague does B everything to keep the British image before the Dutch public. r Every small town receives all the e promotional material it can use if e it plans its own British Week. Albert Hein, a major retail food e chain here, begins a special British s promotional campaign on Sep- 0 tember 12, for which it has received n thousands of flags and pictures of d the royal family. The Embassy has also provided some 25,000 cut-outs Sos London buses to be given to d Dutch children. it But it is the personal visits which \"' are crucial in the opinion of trade a specialists here. 0 Last March the Birmingham -' Chamber of Commerce sent a :r 14-man delegation and the London Chamber will send a group of 25 under the chairmanship of Lord Macpherson of Train and Co. :h British trade officials are pleased. :h with exports during the first half >e of this year, being 3 per cent. higher than those for the same :k period in 1965.",

   "text_content" : "Israel patent rights have been taken out for a seawater desa- lination process claimed to cut production costs to about half those of any known method. According to the inventor, Mr. Moshe Goldberg, 9, Akiva Eiger Street, Tel Aviv, the patent, which uses the vacuum freezing method, covers a new technique. Instead of drawing off the vapour from the vacuum chamber in which freezing takes place, the vapour is condensed in the same chamber by a special method. The resulting ice crystals and water are then extracted from the chamber by a \"counter vacuum.\" The crystals are cleared with an aerated water jet and the residue of sea water is used in a heat exchanger to cool inflowing sea water before being ejected. A spray injects the sea water into the vacuum chamber ex- posing as large and as shallow an area of water as possible to the freezing influence of the vacuum. An agitator then en- sures maximum exposure of the mass to the freezing process. The reduction in production costs stems from a lower initial investment, the installa- tion required being considerably smaller than usual, and from lower electricity consumption. A unit capable of producing 2,000 cubic metres of desalted water a day would cost Â£60,000 to construct. Swarf Handling by Hydraulics Swarf and chips from metal machining are handled by a stream of water in an under- floor sluice at the new Norwood factory of Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company. 1.126 S. 70th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At Norwood. near Cincinnati, the swarf falls from the machine through a hole in the floor into the sluice. Velocity of the water is high enough to carry the debris to a central col- lection station where the water is spun off and the steel shav- ings dried. Makes Leather Resist Water Boehme Fettchemie GmbH, 67, Henkelstr., Dusseldorf, Ger- many, claims that leather treated by one of its latest pro- cesses is made highly resistant to water. Leathers can be effectively treated both in coloured or natural conditions. In the pro- cess, Icathers are dipped in a complex solution and allowed to dry slowly in air.

Manufactured in Auburn, N.Y. by Alco Products, Inc., these assemblies are designed -to operate at speeds up to 26,000 revolutions per minute. ticularly suitable for leathers that are to undergo considerable mechanical stress, as when used in footwear or for industrial applications. Cleans Objects Under Water A mechanical brush for clean- ing and rubbing down ships' bottoms, submerged parts of piers, water intakes and other immersed objects has been patented by Joseph Charles Sierra, of 24. Place Belsuncc, Bouches du Rh6ne. Marseilles. It is circular. 16 inches in dia- meter, and driven by an air compressor. It will rotate in both directions. It is claimed that over 5,000 square feet an hour can be cleaned of dirt, slime, and marine growth by a diver using the device. Optical Control for Machine Tools To be shown at the Stock- holm Technical Trade Fair from September 28 to October 4 is optical equipment which extends the working range of standard toolroom surface and cylindrical grinding machines. Manufactured by Precision Grinding, of Mill Green Road, Mitcham, Surrey, the equipment is stated' to enable grinding wheels to be formed accurately and quickly without the use of templates or crushers. The operator can fully optically control the machining. An en- larged form of the grinding wheel and its position in rela tion to the workpiece is shown on the Projectorscope screen and separate inspection is elimi- nated. Also to be shown is the 4HB Alexander hydraulic diesinker, a fully automatic machine de- signed to reproduce high quality moulds and dies from one master. It has a capacity to produce tools 18 inches long, 15 inches high and 10 inches wide, weighing up to 1,500 Ibs. Spindle speeds are infinitely variable in the range of 75- 10.000 rpm and cutting speeds are up to 25 inches per minute. Controlling the Effluent At the International Exhibi- tion of Effluent Technology to be held in Munich from Sep- tember 3 to 9 Siemens and Halske will show equipment designed to measure the oxidis- ing or reducing effect of a solution. Its special applications lie in the control of industrial effluents, particularly those resulting from galvanising pro- cesses. A signal from the equipment can be used to con- trol a complete effluent system. Measurement of the potential takes place between an outer noble metal electrode and an inner electrode completely separated from the corrosive medium. If oxidants are present in the solution, the potential at the outer electrode will increase by a given amount. If the medium is a reducing one, there will be a decrease. The corresponding signal is of the order of several millivolts and is fed to an indi- cator. Gives a Good View of the Image Introduced this week at the 6th International Congress for Electron Microscopy at Kyoto, Japan, is what is claimed to be the first solid state electron microscope. A Philips instru- ment, it will be marketed in the U.K. by the M.E.L. Company, Manor Royal, Crawley, Sussex. It is stated that use of transistors, diodes and printed circuit boards instead of thermionic valve circuitry has resulted in a reliable and ex- tremely stable instrument with all components housed in a single console. Another point made is that operation has been kept as simple as possible so that the microscopist can concentrate on the examination of the speci- g men Vacuum control is fully automatic, a push button reliev- n ing the operator of the responsi- 1 bility of supervising all aspects of vacuum control, including start-up and shut-down pro- 3 cedures. The complete range of magnification. 2,800 to 500,000 Sis covered by a single 25-posi- Stion control. Photographic 3 facilities comprise three Scameras and a semi-auto- s matically operated exposure meter. All three cameras can / be mounted on the microscope at the same time and a total Sos 105 exposures can be accommodated in one loading. A television attachment can be fitted in place of one of the cameras and used to feed up to 30 monitors. Three large view- ing ports at the base of the microscopes column enable six or more observers to view the image. Heated Metal Coats Itself with Resin Metal can be protected with Sa self-curing epoxy powder 1 available from the Three M. Company. Box 3M, St. Paul, Minnesota. The powder is sprayed on hot metal in a -stream of compressed air. The heat of the metal is sufficient I to melt the epoxy so it flows r over the entire surface and 1 cures in a minute. The coated / metal is protected from rust. Scorrosion and the effects of many chemicals.",

The association says that clearly the pitch fibre industry cannot hope to escape entirely the effects of a general setback in building. But it points out that any temporary falling-off in demand should be seen in perspective. Total U.K. production of pitch fibre pipes expanded very rapidly in the decade to the end of 1964. In 1964 itself, there was a bigger increase than in any previous year. In 1965. output was sustained at this high level in spite of the beginning of a decline in building. In the first six months of 1966, sales were in fact slightly better than in the correspond- ing period last year. Savings in manpower and laid costs were among the reasons for the earlier rapid growth in the use of pitch fibre for drainage and other purposes, the association adds.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Scientific Editor NOTTINGHAM. Sept. 1. The Board of directors of a company should receive a proper up-to-date plan of the com. pany organisation at regular intervals, clearly showing the responsibility in the upper ranks, Mr. W. F. Cartwright, managing director of the Steel Company of Wales, said here Sto-day. wu-uay. He told the British Association, Economic Section, that a Board should be positive in its attitude towards training, and should press for the organisation of specialised, general and refresher courses. ----- ucurses. It should ceaselessly inquire into the potential of youth recruitment to the company, and ensure that those having the spark of genius were not lost. Success in Business In an outspoken paper detailing the theme of success in business. already introduced by Professor G. L. S. Shackle in his presiden- tial address. Mr. Cartwright referred to quality control. The establishment of very high quality standards started from the very beginning of a manufacturing pro- cess, he said. Since the war the Japanese had established extremely high stan- dards of quality control through- out their industry. This, coupled with the attitude of a Japanese worker, the attitude of loyalty to- wards his company, contributed. according to Mr. Cartwright, to their undoubted success. On the relationship with labour. he made a strong case ntat ine benaviour of human beings in an affluent society was more difficlt to control than in the semi-feudal society of the early industrial revolution. Mr. Cartwright therefore believed that all Boards should have personnel directors as important as those responsible for finance, marketing and research. \" At the moment. Great Britain's record in the development of good industrial relations is poor,\" he de- clared. The future success of Great Britain and its industry must depend on an understanding of the proper u!- of capital. raw materials and man. power, not only by management and the Board. \"but also by every em- plovee.\" The claims from unions, he main. tained, had been dealt with by em- ployers' associations for far too long. \" It is now the unions who must expect the claims from the manage- ment.\" Research Needs He was sceptical but open-minded about the need for research. \"One of Britain's most successful steel com. panies, from the point of view of return on capital, carries out little research.\" he added. \"Another, not so successful in terms of return on capital, has a long history of success. ful and effective research.\" How much research effort there should be, and on what. remained a problem, he said, facing most Boards. Mr. G. H. Peters, lecturer in Agri. cultural Economics at Oxford, con- tinued the success theme in connection with farming, which he said, appeared to be enjoying a period of newly. found success and prosperity. He examined this apparent success, and found that though returns earned ^_Â·Â·____ by commercial and large businesses remained high, there were real proh. lems among the smaller-scale pro. ducers, making up the less-favoured half of the agricultural community. In 1964, of the 76,000 farms of less than 100 acres, some 31,000 failed to reach the level of an agricultural worker's wage. There was a need for improved training in technological and manage. ment skills because these variables were enormously important as con- tributory causes of income differences. Brain v. Computer Professor J. S. Griffith, of the University of London. made a remarkable quantitative comparison between the human brain and digital conputers in his paper to the Mathematics Section. An important point he made was that though it was usually said that a computei was much faster than the human brain, this was based on ele- mentary arithmetic. He argued that as the human brain can handle much more information a second than a computer, its information handling ability, in terms of bits of informa. tion. might actually be faster than that of a computer. Professor Griffith's paper followed an abstruse account of how the brain might work. This was by Professor E. C. Zeeman, of the University of Warwick. He used the little-known branch of mathematics called topo- logy, which deals with the relation- ships of points in space, to build a possible model of the brain and its action. He used it because with it he could build a qualitative picture of the brain as a whole without the need for measurement. Tin, coner and silver were at times semi-precious metals because of the prices quoted for them in world mar- kets. Professor R. S. Nyholm, Pro- fessor of Chemistry. University College, London. said in his presi- dential address to the Chemistry Section. The interest being shown in the old tin mines of Cornwall showed how prices were rising, be said. Man ought to be thinking now how to use sub. stitutes, not only for economic reasons but to conserve precious elements for the future. Aid Finances Call Alarm at the financial situation of the British Association was expressed in a resolution from its general com- mittee which called upon its officers to renew requests for help to the Government. Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, the eminent British crystalographer who works at University College. London, where she is Professor of Chemistry. has been elected president-elect of the British Association for the year 1967-68. She will be the first woman ever elected president, and will .pre- side over the 1968 meeting at Dundee."

   "text_content" : "After years of steady growth, the Swedish economy has run into balance of payments difficulties and industry is already wondering how it is going to absorb the latest pay award. The wage agreement at least promises industrial peace for the next three years, but it also promises to add around 30 per cent. to wage costs. On the other side of the coin, the Swedish Government positively pampers industrial companies, at east in comparison with British firms. This week's Investors Chronicle points out that depreciation allow- ances are such that machinery can be written down by 50 per cent. in two years, or completely written off in five; indeed, machinery and equipment with a life of three years or less can be written off immedi- ately. Another unique concession allows stocks to be written down to the lowest of cost or replacement value and Sweden is alone in world economies in trying to iron out business cycles by allowing com- panies to transfer up to 40 per cent. of pie-tax profits to an investment fund such funds being used, with the permission of the authorities. during periods of recession for the purchase of fixed assets and stocks. The system has had a great deal to do with the success of the Swedish economy in post-war years but will it continue to work now that the economy has become overheated? In a rapid look at industry, the Investors Chronicle believes that it will, provided the present restric. tions are not lifted too soon.",

   "text_content" : "ONE OF the problems which has been preoccupying the Government since it came into office is how to get up-to-date information about price move- ments in industry. This is a subject which certainly merits close investigation. Very. little is known about the price- making process in industry. Some firms are eager to publicise price reductions when they occur, but they are naturally less frank about increases. Prices of most con- sumer products can be watched without much difficulty; semi- manufactures and industrial products present more serious problems. Code numbers The best-informed people in this field are usually the purchasing officers of big com- panies and nationalised corpora- tions. It is not unreasonable that the Government should look to this body of men, and their professional association, the Purchasing Officers Associa- tion, as a potential source of information about price changes. But how far should the Purchasing Officers Association go in meeting the Government's requests? It has now been disclosed that the Association has been assist- ing the Department of Economic Affairs with a system of confi- dential reporting about prices. Some 400 company buyers send information to the POA's economic committee about re- cent increases in the price of goods and services which they purchase. The system involves the use of code numbers to ensure that the names of the co-operatng companies remain secret. Similarly, when the in- formation is passed on to the Government, the names of the companies which have raised prices are not revealed. Only the products are given, and it is up to the Government to find out, if it wishes, which company is responsible. Ih There is nothing unethical ie about this, but it does seem o slightly odd for a professional te association to be used as \"the e- eyes and ears of a Government a department,\" as the director of ts the POA expressed it yesterday. le No doubt it can be claimed that -the POA is merely helping to y. improve the Government's re- o porting services, and this is in n the interests of industry as a e whole. It is not the POA's con- it cern, after all, what happens to i- the information after it has been d supplied. If the DEA chooses i- to do some informal arm- Il twisting, in the style of President is Johnson, to keep prices down, that is the Government's busi- ness. Nevertheless, one is left with the uneasy feeling that the POA n is using its position in a way e which goes beyond the normal Sfunctions of a professional asso- \" ciation. Its main function is to e improve the efficiency of pur- d chasing in industrial and public d undertakings, and this is a very 1, important role to perform. A -secondary function is to \"collect :f and circulate information regard- 9. ing commodities, markets and ie general economic conditions.\" n But this is not the same as pass- 's ing on information about specific price increases, on a confidential it basis, to a Government depart- t- ment. ic i- Clause four s. All this is particularly delicate d at the present time, in view of s the element of compulsion in- . volved in Clause Four of the f Prices and Incomes Act-if it is 'y activated. It is one thing for :s companies to notify the Govern- 0 ment, whether voluntarily or ue under compulsion, of their own n price changes. It is quite I- another thing for a professional ie association to be used as a con- ie fidential informant, not for the d general public or for industry as y a whole, but for a Government is which may soon have the power d to impose penalties on firms that ly put up prices without adequate justification.",

   "text_content" : "ONE SECTOR of the American economy that is definitely not booming is the housebuilding industry. The number of new houses started has fallen preci- pitously in the past few months and in July was the lowest for more than five years; by the end of 1966, the number of new starts may well be running at a level fully a third below the actual level of 1965. This fall is entirely due to the tightness of credit and the consequent rise in interest rates. The savings and loans associau lions (the U.S. equivalent of our own building societies, which provide about half the total of mortgage linance for house pur- chase) have been unable to keep up with the competition for deposits, particularly in areas where their maximum lending rate is traditionally regulated by law, and mortgages are becom- ing Increasingly dilllcult to obtain. Congress Is understand. ably agitated about the situatlon, but the only remedy so far pro- posed is to extend the power of the authorities to regulate in. terest rates in general-a pro. posal that is not popular with any of the Intnitutions that stand to be affected by it. Government pressure Mr. Callaghan and the now Housing Minister, Mr. Green- wood, might well learn from American experience, There is no legal limit In this country on the rate that building socleties nmay charge for mortgage advances, but the Building Societles Assoclation has heen under constant pressure from the (iovernment for months paist to keep its recommended rntieo fronm following other interest rates upwards When the Council of the Association meolt next week, It will have to decide whether or not to comply with the Government's request that the Increase in mortgage rates to existing borrowers already notified but not yet effective should be held bauk until the Prices and Incomes Hoard reports in the middle of October. The odds are, since decisions requiro a two-thirds majority, that the Council will deoode either to let things stand sn they are or to postpono the Increase until January. The Government and the general public should, In any csise. be left in no doubt about what a decision to co-operate may imply, There are two issues involved in the controversy about building society rates. The first and more technical, which the Prices and Incomes Board is considering, is the desirable level of reserves. The need to maintain a certain level of reserves to assets-either for reasons of commercial pru- dence or to qualify for trustee status or membership of the Association-requires the societies to maintain a minimum differential between the rate at which they borrow and that at which they lend, If this need were to be removed or reduced, as some people advocate, it would be possible to lend rather more cheapl than otherwise, But it could he removed or reduced only with the help of some substitute for reserves, like a (iovernment guarantee, and after changing present trustee legislation, Whether or not such steps are desirable-the societies disagree among themselves on the point-they go far beyond the immediate attempt to impose a rough-and-ready froeeo on prices, Incompatible aims Nor are they relevant to the second and more important issue at stake, the freedom of huilding societies to oifer the market rate for deposits and adjust their lending rate accordingly. At present, money is still coming in fairly well, hut there is a general feeling that compeoltion from local authorities may become fiercer later In the year, If the inflow of funds then falls off, the societie face a israightforward choice; they either raise their borrowing and lending rates or they run out of money to lend, This, however, is the choice which the (iovernment refuses to understand, 'The Treasury wants the price of mortgage flnance to existing owner. occupiers (most of whom, In any case, take the option to go on paying the same for longer when rates go up) to remain un. chaned.

   "text_content" : "BY JOE ROGALY reHmERE is no escape. Every employer-Oxfam, a man with a butler, or ICI-must pay Selective Employment Tax from Monday. The table shows how much. Some employers will get their money back. Some will get a bonus. The question is, who ? The Selective Employment Payments Act gives some idea. It is a rigid law, with built-in anomalies and some room for evasion. But it does give Ministers discretion in some cases; it does leave some matters open to appeal, and-as with all taxation-it relies on civil ser- vants to interpret it when they make the detailed rules for carrying it out. Extra Civil Servants Three major Ministries are involved; between them they are taking on an extra thousand civil servants to cope with the task. The new Ministry of Social Security (which, to out- siders, is still in a state of in- fantile chaos) collects the tax and will refund it to the elderly. the sick, and single parents if they need domestic help. It may be difficult to qualify; those who think they might should obtain leaflet TR18 from the Post Office or the local Ministry of Social Security Office. It will be out on Monday. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will pay refunds to farmers, forestry employers and horticulturists. The' department's explanatory form and questionnaire has already gone out to its subjects; anyone who feels missed out can still apply for one. But em- ployers in the fishing industry should not make the mistake of applying to the Ministry of Agri- culture. Fisheries and Food; fishing refunds come under the Ministry of Labour. It is this Ministry that will do the bulk of the work. It will Employers' Contributions Premiums* Weekly Old Tax New s. d. s. d. s. d. s. d. Men .............. 13 4 25 0 38 4 32 6 Women .......... 11 4 12 6 23 10 16 3 Boys ............ 9 0 12 6 21 6 16 3 Girls ............ 7 6 8 0 15 6 2 6 *Including tax refund; those entitled to refunds only get the tax back, but no extra. pay the premiums to manufac- turers and the refunds to employers in fishing. mining, quarrying and transport and communications. Here is what the future holds for such employers: The first step is to acquire the 1963 consolidated edition of the Standard Industrial Classifica- tion (HMSO, 3s 6d). plus its accompanying alphabetical list of industries (9s). The next step is to send round to the local Ministry of Labour s. office for the official explanatory y guide for employers. This will s set out the rules as the Ministry i; sees them. It is being distributed n to branches now for general i- publication on Monday. Some y branches might have it to-day; f others not until Tuesday. i- With the guide employers I; should obtain one copy of the e form SEP 1 for each \" establish- ment \" in the company. \" Estab. o lishment\" needs careful defini- II tion. but if one form per set of premises is taken-plus, in the case of large companies, an extra few for luck-that should be enough. This four-page form contains 21 questions. Nearly all can be an wered with one or two figures or a simple yes or no. Companies will be asked to say how many men, women, boys and girls are working at or from Hie establishment, includ- ing those on holiday, sick, or temporarily abroad but exclud- ing anyone who works less than eight hours a week. They will be asked their place in the Standard Industrial Classi. fication; what they do (a short answer like \"produce ball-bear- ings \" will suffice), and how their staff is -divided according to whether they are production, office, transport, or sales staff. Other questions relate to seasonal employment, separate research or training establish- ments, and requests to the Minister. Employers will be asked not to send in these forms until October 1, 1966. They can delay until December 31 without for- feiting the right to collect re- funds or premiums back-dated to September 5. These forms will be used by the Ministry to draw up regis- ters of those entitled to refunds or premiums. Every registered firm will, in time, then be notified and sent a claim form, SEP 4 (for premiums) or SEP 5 (for refunds). The first claim will cover the period from September 5 to January 1, 1967, and payments will come during the first quarter of 1967. After that they will be quarterly and, later still, bi-monthly. Claims, which should be sent to the local office of the Ministry, will be paid by credit transfer to the firm's bank. In making out claims, firms em- ploying fewer than 200 people will have to state the number of men, women, boys and girls em- ployed during each week of the claims period, work out the amount due, and have the form signed by a senior member of the firm. Companies with more than 200 workers can opt for a second, faster, method. They can list the number of employees for the first and last weeks only and then give a global figure for SET paid during the whole claim period. They then add 30 per cent. and the result is the refund due. Registration This method could mean a slight loss, since the premium under SET is 30 per cent. for men, women and boys-but 311 per cent. for girls. Firms that do employ young girls might decide that the quicker method saves enough in accounting costs to make up for the slight (ld a week) loss of premium. None of this applies, how- ever, if the employer has not registered his establishments, and it is worth looking more closely, therefore, at the condi- tions for registration. Establish- ments are to be placed on the premium register if the work done in them is classified within Orders III to XVI of the Standard Industrial Classifica- tion (this includes most manu- facturers), or if they print films for cinemas or print or publish newspapers. Book publishers who do not also print have, protesting, been excluded. Related scientific research or training establishments can also qualify; those most distantly related (because they are in separate companies but still relevant to manufacturing) need a certificate from the Ministry of Technology in the case of research, and the Ministry of Labour in the case of appren- tices or trainees. In each establishment more than half the employees must be working mainly \"in connection with\" the defined activities. No more than half can be working \"for office purposes,\" as sales- men, or in transport of the goods of the company or an associated company. Establishments thus registered will be paid the premium for newspapers. HooK publishers who do not also print hate, protesting, been excluded. Related scientific research or training establishments can also qualify; those most distantly related (because they are in separate companies but still relevant to manufacturing) need a certificate from the Ministry of Technology in the case of research, and the Ministry of Labour in'the case of appren- tices or trainees. In each establishment moro than half the employees must be working mainly \"in connection with\" the defined activities. No more than half can be working \"for office purposes,\" as salcsÂ· men, or in transport of the goods of the company or an associated company. Establishments thus registered will be~paid the premium for every employee, including the minority not engaged in manu- facturing. The definitions of the terms used are important. They are: Establishment-Strictly, this means the business of a single employer occupying a single set of premises or part of premises -the rule is that access to all parts of the premises must be possible without leaving them. But, if the employer applies, he might persuade the Minister to treat a single set of premises as two or more establishments (\"dividing.\" the officials will call it); or he might obtain a ruling that two or more different sets of premises consti- tute a single establishment. This will be called \" aggregating.\" In either case it is up to the employer to apply (the Minister cannot unilaterally decide) and there is no appeal. Different in Kind Dividing-The Minister will usually agree to division if the activities concerned are different in kind, carried out in different parts of the premises, and separately identifiable in the company's records. \"Different in kind\" will usually be tested P' by working out whether the different activities could be classified under different \"mini- mum list\" headings in the Standard Industrial Classifica- tion. Thus a factory and a shop, or a joinery (attracting premium) and a builders' yard (oaying tax) could be separated. But the office part of a factory could not: both fall under the same SIC head. Aggregating-Two buildings separated by a public road could be aggregated (in the original draft of the Act this was one of the most glaring anomalies), but buildings separated by several miles would not get the Minister's approval. Buildings can only be aggregated if the work in both of them con- tributes to the same SIC heading-thus the office part of a factory can be aggregated to it (a useful point where the factory workers across the road are in the majority) but a factory and shop would probably not be. Room for Flexibility Once establishments have been divided or aggregated, according to which suits the employer best, the employees in each one must be classified. The important point is that not more than half must be in \"non-qualifying activities \"-which means activi- ties \" for office purposes\"; sell- ing; or (in the case of premium establishments) transport. There is room for some flexibility here. Working \"for office purposes\" means administration, handling money, telephone and telegraph operators, writing, book-keeping, sorting papers, filing, typing, machine calculating. It does not include works managers, fore. men, planning engineers or Continued on Page 15"

   "text_content" : "Sir,-Much will be said in the next weeks regarding the need for greater productivity and much needs to be clearly explained as to how this can be achieved to the satisfaction of all. A case in point concerns the generation of that vital commodity, electric power, the number of kilowat hour units per man generated in the modern coal- fired stations being ten times that of 30 .ears ago. This, however, is no indication of what will be achieved within the next five years. The largest coal- fired station being constructed in the U.K. at present will generate at just over Yd per unit, with a station staff of about 400 and con- suming 6m. tons of coal a year- the output of some 10.000 miners. On the other hand, a hydro-electric station under construction in British Columbia will generate the same number of electrical units at rather less than one-third of the cost and require a staff of only 40. no manpower being required to supply the \" fuel.\" No wonder industry is being attracted to areas of cheap power. At this stage it is usually said that such advantages do not apply in this country as we are not blessed with almost unlimited water power. The U.K., however is rich in technological ability and, in consequence, the latest develop- ment in nuclear power stations. using the fast-breeder type of reactor, will generate at about half the cost of the best coal-fired stations. Furthermore, in terms of manpower, the ability to \"breed\" its own fuel after the initial supply, puts the third generation of nuclear stations into the hydro-electric category that requires no man. power to supply the \" fuel,\" Confidence will only he given at the forthcoming productivity con. ferences if it is shown how \"savings\" in manpower can be translated into increased produc. tion of goods and services in an- other section of the economy. To do this it should be realised that I per cent. loss of potential output due to unemployment, restrictive practices or rejection of higher pro- ductivity equipment, means that the nation is poorer by Â£30m. a year- the equivalent output of 250,000 people. The monetary requirement for Â£30m. of goods and services to be produced and purchased requires some Â£11m. of money in circulation. To redeploy man- power may require not only re- training but the necessary credits flowing through the new channels. This is a very different matter from increasing the money supply by 7,1 per cent. for a 2 per cent. increase in GNP, as in 1965, some channels overflowing and others needing stimulation.

The writer of the article did not mention the possibility of financ. ing future construction by charg* ing tolls, either on existing motor- ways or on future motorways, when built. Admittedly this would raise the cost of transport for the users of such roads but on the other hand if it comes to a choice between \"no motorway\" or \" toll motorway\" then I believe most users, both private and industrial, would choose the latter. It should be possible to set a toll rate at which the economics of using a toll motorway rather than the existing \" A\" roads would still he favourable to most 'users, while the tolls would provide a source of revenue either for financing future construction or for servicing the cost of existing motorways or a combination of the two.

   "text_content" : "Sir,--While in no way wanting to dirarage the efforts of the Government to prevent devaluna tion, might I plead for an attempt to be made to recover for sterling its ability to earn a profit for us as a reserve currency? Those who want to take sterling out of this market forget that 18 months ago a profit was being made, a very satisfactory one to England, out of this property of sterling. Idle working capital was left in the City of London, earning a relatively low rate of interest. Countries all over the world were using London for this purpose. Indeed, a distinguished Frenchman was quite jealous not so long ago that sterling had this privileged position. This money lying in London was then' re-lent, both inside and out- side Great Britain, for either, astonishingly enough, a short or a long period of time. Yes. it was being lent to local authorities to help them to finance their housing programmes. But it might be said that this is a thing of the past. It is a position for sterling that cannot be recovered, but it is the purpose of this letter to argue that this recovery is not only essential but inevitable, inevitable because London, if she is trusted, and certain alterations in our tax laws are made, will soon return to a routine she so understood how to practise. Essential because our debt of over Â£1,00km. to the International Monetary Fund can be paid off in no other way. This cannot be done in one giant operation. There is nothing to do it with. Not unless our balance of trade takes a somersault and begins to show us a Â£500m. surplus a year, an unlikely event. No. Only as idle working capital returns to London-that is international working capital-and is left here night after night because London has recovered her reputation for honesty and fair dealing will we have the where- withal to begin redeeming this debt to the IMP. CGRALD R. GUINNrss. Chandos House, Chester Street, S.W.I.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staff The Ministry of Labour has delayed giving inal rullngs on whether two key agreements violate the wage freeze. A decision was expected this week on whether a 2s-a-week cost of living bonus for 25,000 newspaper workers-due to have come into force yesterday-could be replaced by payments into a special fund. Mr. Ray Gunter, Minister of S Labour, was also expected to give guidance about a productivity deal covering 10.000 Clyde shipyard boilermakers. However, it now seems unlikely that the two sets of parties will re- ceive letters from the Minister for several days. In the case of the printers the delay appears to be deliberate. Print union anger about the freeze is decreasing with time and the fact that the Newspaper Proprietors' Association has sus- pended the bonus pending Mr. Gunter's letter, was received calmly yesterday. Similar Tactics Similar tactics are being used over the two separate productivity deals on London evening papers being considered by the Minister. He has not yet asked to see leaders of the paperworkers section of the Society of Graphical' and Allied S Trades despite the fact that a Â£1- a-week productivity bonus is still being paid to its members at the Evening News. The deal came into force on August 1. Neither has Mr. Gunter replied to last week's joint approach by SOGAT and the NPA in which they asked whether a proposed pro- ductivity deal on the Evening Stan- dard could go ahead. Earlier the union had withdrawn threats ot strike action if the deal was frozen. .... Â· The Clyde boilermakers' pact is causing the Government a great deal of heart searching. This-and not tactical considerations- accounts for the delay. It is the most important flexibility deal negotiated by the traditionally mili- tant Boilermakers' Amalgamation and is regarded by the union as a major demonstration of its willing- ness to take part in attempts to modernise shipbuilding. However. the agreement was in operation only in one yard when the freeze was imposed. When Mr. Gunter saw Boiler- makers' leaders and representatives of the Clyde Shipbuilders Associa- tion last week he is understood to have told them that he regarded their agreement as one of the best that had been brought to his notice. He would not take the responsi- bility for vetoing it alone. Possible Way Out There is a way out if the Govern- ment wishes to take it. The agree- ment could be completely excluded from the freeze because some of the men involved were already being paid when the Prime Minister made his statement. How- ever, such a decision-which might be read as a weakening of the Government's determination to im- pose an absolute standstill-could not be taken by Mr. Gunter and consultations with the Board of Trade and the Department of Economic Affairs are taking place.",

   "text_content" : "A DISPUTE at the Abbey Works of the Steel Company of Wales, Port Talbot, as to whether brick- layers or steelworkers should be responsible for a new method of relining converters with dolomite blocks was described yesterday as \" explosive\" by Mr. John Leonard, president of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers. The company proposed that the work should be done by steel workers but the bricklayers claim that they should do it. After a deputation of the Brick- layers Union had represented their case to Mr. D. W. Jones, Concilia tion Officer of the Ministry of Labour at Cardiff, Mr. Jack Thomas, secretary of the central works committee of the 278 brick- layers at the Abbey Works, said: \" If the management continue their present attitude, strike action is inevitable. We are defending an agreement and our men are determined.\" Mr. Leonard said after the meet- ing: \"The management say that the laying of dolomite blocks i% unskilled work but we do not accept that. That is why they say that steelworkers should do it.\" The failure of yesterday's con- sultations leaves the next step up to the company. It is understood that there is no pressing technical reason for switching to the new method of lining the ovens immediately. The company may well decide that further consulta- tions with the unions are in order. However, most major British steel companies have already made the change.",

TUC leaders are trying to. prevent the Trades Union Congress from debating the pay freeze next Monday on the afternoon when the Prime Minister is due to address Congress. Congress. The plan is for Congress to debate all economic subjects next Wednesday, two days after Mr. Wilson makes his speech. But when the TUC General Council went through the agenda tor Congress here to-day, it found that a motion, due to be discussed on Monday, could well provoke delegates to attack the pay treeze. It is a composite motion from the Civil Service Clerical Associa- tion and the National Union of Vehicle Builders, calling on Con- gress to accept that \" t is abso- lutely necessary that arbitration tribunals should be independent of direct Government influence, and should be seen to be independent.\" As it happens this proposal would probably meet with the approval of Sir Roy Wilson, Presi- dent of the Industrial Court. who said in July that it was wrong and undesirable to make arbitrators apply Government incomes policy. Embarrassment But Sir Harry Douglass. the steel workers' leader, said to-day that a debate on this subject next Monday could gravely embarrass the General Council. Other members of the General Council pointed out that it would be absurd if Congress called for arbitration tribunals to be free of Government influence, and then on Wednesday decided to acquiesce in the pay freeze. Mr. Les Cannon. president of the Electrical Trades Union, was the first to make this point. But he was opposed by left-wing members of the General Council. led by Mr. Harry Nicholas, assistant general secretary or the Transport and General Workers' Union, and Mr. John Newton, general secretary of the National Union of Tailors and Gar. ment Workers, who thought that the motion on arbitration tribunals was a good one, and ought to be supported. The discussion ended when Mr. George Smith, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Wood. workers, said that the General Council was wasting time over a play on words. If Congress decided next week as a matter of general policy to support the Government's present economic measures this would be the overriding decision so far as arbi. tration tribunals were concerned. Voting Advice When each motion is discussed at Congress. a spokesman for the General Council gives advice to the delegates on how they should vote. But Mr Smith suggested to-day that the best thing for the General Coun- cil to do with the motion on arbitra- tion tribunals was to say nothing to the delegates. In this way, he said. a big debate might be avoided. The chairman, Mr. Joe O'Hagan. seized on Mr. Smith's proposal as offering the best way out of the General Council's dilemma, and the other members accepted it without voting.",

   "article_dc_title" : "What It Would Mean If They Did Leave",
   "text_content" : "By J. D. F. JONES, Our Diplomatic Correspondent Although most people are awaretthat the Commonwealth is something more than a \"talking shop,\" they have only the vaguest idea of what Commonwealth membership actually means. This impreci- sion, this impossibility of definition-which the cynics will say is the Commonwealth's salvation-make it particularly difficult to assess the gravity of any resignation by a member or a group of members. President Kaunda has now given a clear warning that Zambia will have to leave the Commonwealth if British policy over Rhodesia does not change. Zambia's example would prob- ably be followed by Tanzania, and possibly by Sierra Leone and even Uganda. Obviously the withdrawal of any of these African member states over a matter of principle would be a blow to the Commonwealth as a multi-racial organisation. But what would it actually mean- for Zambia, and for Britain- beyond a psychological blow and an empty chair at future conferences? Four Different Concepts A great deal of the vagueness about the Commonwealth arises from the widespread habit of confusing at least four different concepts-the Commonwealth proper. the Ottawa Preference area. the sterling area. and the British aid programme to developing countries. The significance of withdrawal of any one country from the Commonwealth can be assessed under any of these heads-with the proviso that the real signiti- cance of withdrawal, both to the member and to the organisa- tion. will be something over and above any statistical calculation. Aid is the most important example. All the African coun- tries receive assistance of different sorts from Britain, and this aid is usually associated with Commonwealth status so that the effect of withdrawal would almost certainly be to affect the future aid flow. Zambia. for instance, received Â£4.5m. in 1965 in grants, loans and technical assistance, and Â£7.4m in 1964. Nearly 2.000 \" publicly financed persons\" from Britain were working in Zambia last year most of whom were paid for under the im- portant Overseas Service Aid Scheme; 29 Zambian students were in the U.K. financed by the British Government. Zambia is rather a special case because of her considerable copper wealth, which makes technical assistance far more important than straight sinan- cial aid. Tanzania was allocated bilateral aid of Â£5.1m. in 1965. and 774 British-financed people were working there (the diplomatic rupture between Britain and Tanzania has introduced some uncertainty here). Sierra Leone received Â£l.lm. in 1965, Â£2m. the previous year, and had 38 teachers, administrators and technical assistants. This sort of British official aid would certainly not be cut off overnight if the recipient decided to leave the Common- wealth. But because over 80 per cent. of the British aid pro- gramme happens to be funnelled through the Commonwealth for traditional and understandable reasons. because there would be administrative problems in- volved in switching aid pro- grammes from the \"Common- wealth\" to the \"Foreien\" head, and because the British public would probably be less well-disposed to continue or increase aid to a non-Common- wealth country than to a steady member, the country which left the Commonwealth after a dis- agreement would probably find itself sinking in the table of aid recipients. Another impor- tant point is that British per- sonnel who have staved on under the OSAS scheme would be more likely to give up and return home if the Common- wealth tie had been severed. No Preferential Tariff Link Another area where Common- wealth membership is widely-- and erroneously-believed to carry great tangible advantages is trade, where there is a popu- lar belief that the Common wealth is linked by a system of preferential tariffs. This is not true of the African Common- wealth-indeed. it is one of the ironies of Britain's trade policy that the African country which benefits most from Common- wealth preference is South Africa. Zambia. Tanzania and Sierra Leone do not give pre- ference to British goods, and they do not benefit particularly from the preferences that Britain offers to Commonwealth im- ports: the great bulk ol Zambia's exports, for example. are made up of copper, and copper comes into the U.K. at a nil tariff The strength of trading links, however, does not depend only on tariff preferences. The trade pattern of all three of these countries is dominated by Britain: three-quarters of Sierra Leone's exports come to Britain, one-third of Tanzania's, and one-third of Zambia's.. Britain sold Â£15m. worth of exports to Zambia in 1965 and took Â£76m. Mr. Arnold Cantwell Smith imports, and as a result of UDI Anglo - Zambian trade links are strengthening dramatically. Britain's 1965 trade total with Tanzania totalled Â£30m.: the Sierra Leone figure was Â£37m. It is clearly ridiculous to expect a rapid shift in this pattern, whatever happens at next week's Prime Ministers' Conference and whatever happens between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith. On the other hand. Britain's trade with the Commonwealth. seen as a proportion of the total, has been declining rapidly. The economic changes inside the developing countries have already gone far to jeopardise Britain's traditional position. So from Britain's point of view, any event which suggests a further moving apart -any factor which might en- courage other businessmen to move in-would be dangerous. Nor will another aspect of Commonwealth relations - the special commodity agreements, principally the sugar quotas- affect the situation of the three countries mentioned. But this brings the argument back to the basic question- would a resignation from the :lub have any actual effect? The Commonwealth, as poll- ticians and officials all over the world will insist, carries enor- mous advantages for most of its members, but they are so often intangible. Few people v.ould deny the value of the consultation which is always going on and which acts as a bridge between the developing world and the West This con- sultation extends across an enormous and little-known range of subjects, from inter- national power politics to the Commonwealth Bureau of Helminthology at St. Albans, to choose an extreme example. South Africa's Example But, as with all the best institutions, formal membership does not seem to matter very much, and the African leaders who are now getting so upset with Mr. Wilson may yet find that their resignation makes very little difference to their Commonwealth relationship. The size of the British aid offer might. after a long interval, be cut back for ex-members; diplo- matic and defence advice would probably be harder to come by. and eventually visitors to Britain would be aliens. But would the tradine pattern channe appreciably? Would the local population suddenly find them- selves cut off from the \"Commonwealth way of life?\" Would London become an alien capital? Probably not. Presi- dent Kaunda might do well to take a look at South Africa's example In 1961 Dr. Voerwerd was driven from the Common- wealth. Yet ever since. South African trade with Britain has climbed rapidly. British invest- ment has continued unchecked, and South Africa continues to eniov the benefits of Common- wealth preference and the Commonwealth commodity agreements. The Common- wealth may have been the better for the withdrawal of the Republic. but the Republic has hardly suffered.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF Thanks to the rapid growth of Rank Xerox, profits of the Ra& Oigatr1sto have shot ahead but the dividend is re- stticted to conform with the standstill (see Lex, Page 1). tgady Mized Coacrete results are dead in line with the forecast and the J. and F. Stone figures when adjusted to a full year indicate little change. But Klinger's half-year statement shows it is making a recovery (see Lex) and Ashe Chemical is going ahead well, while Arthur Wardle also looks for higher profits. Ashe Chemical In the past few weeks the Asbe Chemical price has come back with the rest of the market and the yield has gone up to 5.2 per cent.-a return not seen for some time. Even so. it could be too generous. In the first place the interim results show another advance, this time 18 per cent., to Â£111.000 pre-tax. The second half. however, is much the more profitable. Apart from seas- onal variations, advertising expen- diture in the first six months is heavier and the second half takes the benefit. And there are' still con- tributions to come from recent acquisitions. On this basis the full year could produce pre-tax profits of around the Â£300,000 compared with Â£232,000 a year ago, showing earnings of 45 per cent., and cover of nearly 1.6 times for a main- tained 28.6 per cent. total dividend. The interim is now increased from the equivalent of 9.6 per cent. to 12 per cent., but with qualifica- tions about the final in relation to the squeeze. If the group in fact sticks to a 21 per cent. final the total would be 33 per cent. against 28.6 per cent., lifting the prospec- tive yield at Ss 7%d to nearly 6 per cent. Certainly there is scope for a higher payment, particularly in view of prospects. Exports are going ahead strongly and account for over a fifth of sales, while at home the diversion of consumer spending power away from the more expensive items could have a beheficial effect. Arthur Wardle Few companies are forecasting higher profits for the current year and it is all the more surprising that a building contractor and estate developer should do so. But half-time pre-tax profits of Arthur Wardle Group are 7 per cent. up at Â£92.000 and a minimum Â£210.000 is expected for the full year, mak- ing 4 rise of over 9 per cent. Some two-thirds of profits come from house building, largely in the lower price range, with the rest from contracting activities taking in office blocks, churches and shop- fitting. etc. Wardle's strong point is that it concentrates on forward sales and thus current purchasers made their mortgage arrangements months before the building society squeeze on loans. This suggests that the gioup could feel the brunt next year. but there is little evidence of a downturn so far. Another major sales programme is under way for houses due for completion at the end of this year and the middle of next, and there is a waiting list. SAssuming profits as intimated- Swhich excludes some Â£16.00 Anticipated from the J;. T Lawlor acquisitloi-a maintained 25 per cett. dividend would be .cverad atblost twice At 4s.9d theb'sroes yield 10.7 per cot.. ad sell O. a ptospecuive P/E trtlo. of. ny, Leyland Rubber SThe hope that the South African end of Leylaud ,l B anlghtm Rubblr--ow accouitinp for pro- bably 854 per cent of ..group profits-would keep. growing sugfi- ciently to offset a downturn at home is dimmed at least for ,the time being. S.A.'s contribution to the 1965-66 results looks to have stayed, roughly the same, although the. 10 per cent. drop in minorities suggests that South African Rubber Manufacturing had a less- successful year. It is the U.K. end that has really been the trouble. and grQup rofits before tax are down from Â£1.56m. to Â£1.23m. But this is still better than the 1963-64 level and: given the progress of SLeyland in recent years cannot.be viewed as too disappointing In spite of its overseas earnings Leyland is not worried by corpora- tion tax, Even after the recent S.A. budget and tax increases the over- all rate is not likely to rise above 37% per cent. Thus, edrnings emerge at 25.2 per cent. for the maintained 22% per cent. dividend. But what these and other further disinflationary moves will do to profits is another matter. The com- pany. however, seems reasonably optimistic -about prospects, but until the U.K. shows signs of picking up profits are not likely to move far. This-would leave the Sdividend looking a bit thin on the ground if it were not for one im- portant point-namely the strong liquid resources. At end-June. 1965. these amounted to Â£1.71m.. or 3s 7d a share. Accepting that a Spolitical discount on Leyland has to be made, the shares at 12s yield- t in 9.7 per cent, still, look fair value. L Steinberg and Sons During the Ii months' period to end-March last, Stelsberg and Sons (London and South Wales) earned pre-tax profits of Â£240,000 com- I pared with Â£246.000 in the year 1964-65. Adjusting this to, a full Syear suggests an Improvement- of SÂ£15.000 to Â£261,000 which would In- t dicate earnings of 29.2 per cent. after a subnormal tax charge. The dividend total is marginally lower at 18:3 per cent. against an. effec- Stive 18% per cent., but of coqrse Sthis is for the shorter 11. months' I period. * This group of fashion wear t manufactoren 't pears ftobe keep I ing ahead; reorganisation, in itt Horrockses Fashion subsidiary should have resulted in a profit Sfrom that direction last year.

   "text_content" : "Results of Olympla for the current year are not expected to fall short of those for 1965-66, when group pre-tax profits reached Â£439.348. Zxj.7,.Po. In present day conditions it is unwise to make an accurate fore- cast, says Mr. H. Oliver-King, chairman. He also expects there will be less disparity between in- terim and final dividends-the year's total was held at 20 per cent. One reason for last year's profit diop of Â£19,263 was.the high interest on bank indebtedness, which at March 31 was Â£379,815 (Â£136,730). This increase says e chairman, is the \"inevitable result of expansion and modernisation\" at Olympia, and the provision of additional permanent finance is being carefully studied. Poor Section Another factor afecting the result was in exhibition contracting, where the figure was not up to expectation and. the contribution to profit fell from 10 per cent to 2 per cent. This was mainly due to a sharp contraction in the volume of business available to the industry, although the group's interests \"appear to have maintained their normal share of the available trade.\" It is a \"difficult business\" with fine margins and is eaging the close attention of the Board. the 'chairman states. 'Other sections contributed to the pr6fit as follows: exhibition ball proprietors 63 per cent. (same), in- dustrial caterers and hoteliers 25 per cent. (23 per cent.), timber importers and builders' merchants S per cent. (4 per cent.) and garages 5 per cent. (nil). In connection with the possibility of more finance, a revaluation has been obtained \"which adds sub- stantially\" to the book value of the aroup's freehold interest in the lympia site-the parent's land. buildings and fixed plant were shown at Â£3m. in the year-end balance sheet.

   "text_content" : "The long term prospects of Marshalls (Halifax) are \"very bright and I look forward with every con- fidence to the future when the present financial difficulties of the country are overcome,\" says the chairman, Mr. H. G. Marshall But in the immediate future the company could be affected by the recent credit squeeze and restrictions. In the concrete and quarrying divi. sion, sales for the first four months of this year show a substantial in- crease, but in engineering they show a reduction. The chairman warns members that Government measures may prevent the concrete and quarrying division reaching its sales target. Profit before tax from engineering fell from Â£157.042 to Â£123.774 in the year ended March 31. 1966. Sales were maintained, but exports were not up to the level expected and there were the restrictions at home. The concrete and quarrying divi. sion's profit rose from Â£164,045 to Â£182,549 due. to higher turnover. Dividend for 1965.66 was held at 17O per cent. Meeting. Halifax. September 26 at 2.30 p.m.",

A Major Complexity One major complexity, on which most employers should seek extra guidance. is the case or transport. Road hauliers will usually qualify for refund, while most ervice establishments will not (there might be a way out in setting up a separate corn. pany), But some premium establishments will get nothing, some will get refunds, and some will got premiums, depending on the mix of transport workers In the whole. A rough guide follows: Manufacturing establishments will be paid premiums for their transport workers if there is a minority of all non.qualifying workers In the establishment- since In such a case every worker will attract a premium, Equally if the establishment does not qualify for premiums none of the workers will attract one. But a factory that does not qualify for a premium might qualify for a refund If Itl factory workers plus its driven outnumber the rest. Separate but associated oetablish. ments with a majority of trans- port workers will also qualify for refund, Ministry Examples All this in theory, and the Ministry will supply paper iipleO In Its explan*tory leaIlt next week, i (t ve uilred the Information for th rtoile rom the Act and by ask.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN LESTER PIGGOTT, with the 1966 Jockey's Championship almost under his belt, is likely to go further ahead of his nearest pur- suers at Sandown this afternoon. In fact, I expect him to ride three winners: Crocus, Georginka and Speed of Sound. Speed of Sound, an attractive colt by Buisson Ardent, out of a mare by Chanteur II, who goes for the Solario Stakes (4.0), was impressive when winnin his only race to date, over 7 furongs at Newbury on July 23, and since he was backward in condition, he is certain to have improved since then. He faces tough opposition here, notably from Ulplon, a colt by Petition, trained by H. Leader. However, I shall be surprised if Speed of Sound does not win- Seasily. Crocus, Pilgott's mount in the Hook Hanldcapl (3.1), is a useful stayer, who won dver corsee and distance here at the end of May when the ground resembled con- crete. Later, he failed in the Ascot Gold Vase, where the ditence of 2 miles was palpably too far for him. But he ran a qod rce when finishingthrd to W Rumour and Roman Moss in a sponsored race at Newbury in July; and then, after getting bogged down in the mud In the Ripon St. Leger Trial Stakes on August 1, easily won a 1% miles handicap at Haydock ten days later. Like most of Psidium's stock he would no doubt prefer firmer conditions underfoot than will prevail this afternoon, but even so I take him to win. Sagely is the danger. Georginka, a lightly-raced geld- ing by Crepello who won a maiden event at Newmarket on July 30, is no world-beater. But he. ought to be home first in the September Handicap (3.30). It is possile that Piggott will bring his score to four by winning the Orleans Nursery Handicap (4.30) on Midsummer Dream. However, he collected a 10 lbs penalty as a result of his success in a valuable race at Ripon the other day, and I doubt his conceding 6 Ibs to Lacquer, a Shantung filly whom H. Wrags trains for Mr. R. B. Moller. Some moderate three-year-olds contest the Autumn Maiden Plate (2.30) and there is little doubt that Joybells has the ability to win it. However, she has let her stable down several times when strongly fancied, and does not appear to have much stomach for a fight. This being the case, it may be better to take a chance with Chigwell Chtrm0r, a gelding by Oallvanter who, at least, is consistent.",

The ton was finally F.T. At the close, THa FitNCA TisES Industrial Ordinary share index was 1.7 higher at 304.5, after having been 0.9 up at 10.30 a.m., only 0.1 up at noon, and 1.3 up at 2.45 pm. Ganins in all F.T.- quoted stocks still came to as much as 30 per cent., against falls of only 7 per cent; on Wednesday, there were 29 per cent rises against 8 per cent. falls. Dealers quoted higher prices at the opening in sympathy with Wall Street and in expectation that Wednesday's closing strength in London would persist, but quickly ran into stock. Some of this was genuine selling to take advantage of the higher prices-the Stock Exchange Account ends to-day- and some clearly bear sales. This brought a setback, but as the stock was well absorbed, prices, picked ui and were moving ahead again in the afternoon. The tworway nature of the business in the leaden limited the rise nl them, and the running appeared to be taken up mote by the second-line stocks. It was noticeable that rather more buyers were willing to take a \"new. time\" position, although volume for \"new\" was small. The decline in machine tool orders made little impact on prices. The better jobbing markets in some equities became reflected In an increase in the total of bargains marked by 583 to 8.519; a week ago, the total was 8,681. Funds Steady Dealers in British Funds had an- other very quiet day but the general tone remained steady with small buy- mg of short.dated and medium.dated tocka producg further scattered ins of or in prices.

   "text_content" : "By Our Minlag Editor my mUr n The chairman's romised follow- up statement viewing Venulrpm' prospects after the unexpectedly sharp cut in the June dividend is of a rather more reassuring nature and holds out hopes of a gradual recovery in the distribution rate for this Gold Fields group Far Western Rand gold mine. In looking ahead, particularly in the present state of old-mining eco nomics, Mr. R. A. Hope naturally has to surround his predictions with a number of ifs and buts. But broadly speaking the picture is as follows. For the current year to next June a slightly higher working profit is hoped for. So, with capital expendi- ture requirements remain static, a small recovery from the 1965 di- dend total of Is 8.4d is anticipated. In the following year a 30 per cent cut in capital outlays could lead to a \"somewhat further\" increase, while in 1968-69, with expenditure on shaft. sinking almost complete the dividend recovery may be extended afresh. Remaining Life By that time there will be a newly unpredictable factor in the mne itself because operations will have become increasingly dependent on ore, still to be developed in a virtu- ally untouched area at depth in the southern corner of the mme. Also creating uncertainty in the chairmn's theme is the difficulty of assessing liability to claims arising from physical damage caused by the move- ment of surface strata. Venterspost 10s shares were over 30s at one time last year. They are now 15s having dropped from 18s 4td since the June dividend announce- ment The yield on the past year's reduced payment is 11.3 per cent. So there could now be recovery possi- bilities although it should be borne in mind, when viewing the potential yield, that the mine has been going for 27 years and is thus now probably in the final third of its ultimate total life. FALCONBRIDGE'S EARNINGS UP Earnings of the Canadian nickel producer and mining investment house, Falcombridge, have continued to expand in the first half of 1966. The net surplus of $13.8m. (Â£4.6m.) compares with S11.9m. in the same period of 1965 when a record S526.77m. was achieved for the full Syear close on 22 per cent more than the Agure for 1964. Per share the past half-yesrs Cam Ings work out at $2.82 against 42.. for the first half of 1965 and $5.47 fr Sthe whole of that year. The 75 cent rdividend rate has been maintained for Seach of the first three quarters of the current year. Last year the 53 total Swas added to by an end-year extra of 50 cents making 53.50 in all. For 1964 $2.0 was paid. The important part being played in the company's prosperityby i a investment icome indicated by the fact that some two-thirds of earnin\" stemmed from this source in tme half year with Lake Daalt, the playing an important partherein along with dividends from La L-s, the Ncaraguan copper and sold pro ducer, Kilabe (see this column last L Wednesday) and QpIuska which Sproduces copper in ouebe. Operating profit rom nickel at $11.8m. improved only slightly in the half-year although deliveriesa. inclu in a considerable quantity of pur- chased metal sold at approximate cost, were running at a ecord rate. Falconbridge's president, Mr. H. J. e Fraser, says that demand for the company's products has remained Svery strong but costs continue a sharply upward trend and as yet a show no siROs of faieag out.

   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Reporter SALES by area electricity Boards of many domestic appliances-such as cookers, washing machines, and refrigerators-fell in the quarter ended June 30. Compared with the correspond- Ing period of last year. some 3.2 per cent fewer cooker were pur* chased, 12.1 per cent. fewer im- mersion heaters, and 5.3 per cent. fewer refrigerators. Reflecting the depressed state of the washing machine market, show- rooms experienced an 18.2 per cent. drop in washing machine sales. In the case of refrigerators and cookers, the quarter's decline was les sharp than in the first quarter. Brightest feature of the latest sales returns is a 78.4 per cent, rise in purchases of electric storage radiators. May and June sales were extremely good, up more than 100 per cent., and nearly 65 per cent. respectively, and this boosted the quarterly returns to a remarkably high level compared with the average 16.6 per cent. rise recorded in the 12 months ending June 30. Commented the Electricity Council yesterday: \"These con. siderable percentage increases in- dicate the continuing growth in popularity of off-peak electric cen- tra heat ng. The Council is con- centrating its 1966-67 promotion on off-peak heating. \"The general economic climate, with greater restriction on credit and tighter ire-purchae facilities is relectd in the lower sales o other appliances.\""

   "text_content" : "With Wall Stuaet in an unsettled condition, the recent circular from Cazenove and Co. provides some useful reassurance.. Al- though the recent setback was sharper than expected, they \"do not yet believe that the technical position of the market is par- ticularly unsound\" and continue to advocate a more aggressive investment policy. This is based on the fact that economic indicators \"for the most part\" remain favourable and that the supposedly defen- sive sectors of the market \"have in fact provided no protection whatsoever in the recent slide.\" Incidentally, General Motors is cited as an outstandingly cheap blue chip. Ending their circular on the strongest possible note, Cazenove say that \"Whatever the immediate uncertainties may be, our willingness to go on in- vesting money in the United States is based on an unshake- able belief that it still retains a growth economy.\" To take account of recent changes in interest rates, Hoare and Co. have prepared on their computer a revised series of bond value tables covering higher coupon stocks. These tables extend from 6 per cent. to 9 per cent. coupons at per cent. intervals, giving yields from 6% per cent. to 91 per cent. and maturities of 10o years to 40 years at six-monthly intervals. Steel nationalisation is the topic of Myers and Co.'s offering, and despite the many uncertainties, certain conclusions are drawn. Generally, it is thought that dis- counts on compensation \"have now reached a level where, even excluding dividend payments, we would advise retention of hold. ings in this section, while as a speculation a purchase could possibly prove rewarding.\""

   "text_content" : "by B. A. YOUNG In John Bowen's interesting and unusual play nine people are marooned on a raft for the entire period of the action, which covers several years. They are survivors of the great rains of 1967 that covered the earth at least as com- pletely as the Biblical flood. Seven of them are a company carefully selected by one Arthur Henderson, one of nature's Scout- masters, for the contribution they can make to a future civilisation. Arthur's choice was necessarily circumscribed, and he has come up with a pretty dud bunch. They in- clude Captain Hunter, a retired Army officer who, having failed to find other employment, has volun- teered to sail this raft round the world on an exclusive diet of Glub, a patent breakfast food; Harold Banner, a C. of E. parson so \" broad\" as to be uncertain of his belief in God; Gertrude Forbes- Cooper, a failed actress; Tony Batch, a nice mindless muscle-boy; and a boring married couple named Otterdale. They are augmented by Alan Armitage and Sonya Banks, a young couple forced by the weather into an unpremeditated aquatic honeymoon on a dinghy. To cut a long, but fascinating, story short, Arthur's leadership is so effective that he turns first into a fascist dictator and then into a god. The transitions, and the reactions of the ship's company that permit them to take place, are charted with considerable subtlety and a great deal more humour than one expects in this kind of play. It is a light, ironic brand of humour that happens to be parti- cularly to my taste; and beneath its pretty coruscation there is a generous measure of intelligent thought and compassion for the human condition. As might be expected with such a situation on his hands, Mr. Bowep seems to have had some trouble in finishing his play. He relieves Arthur of his immortality by a characteristic move-Arthur finds the physical discomfort of being a god too much for himself and reverts to high priest-but just as he has worked up a nice climax in which Arthur has demanded a human sacrifice and is being brought down by the muscle-boy, he flies off intdowhat, in this semi- science-fiction context. I might describe as a new dimension. But first I must explain how Mr. Bowen contrives to present this world predicament on the stage. The events of the book from which the play is adapted are recounted by a lecturer at a university 200 years after they happened, and con- victs, under hypnosis, are employed to act the parts of the real partici- pants. Well, just as Arthur and Tony are about to engage in their lethal struggle Arthur, or rather the convict playing Arthur, trans- cends his hypnosis and refuses to go on, on the ground that he knows what the consequences of his action will be. Mr. Bowen uses this to make a point about free-will, but my feel- ing is that he only confuses an already complex situation without much advantage. In any case he has to go back to the former posi- tion at once to show what does happen when Arthur and Tony get to grips; and as the last act (there are three) is already too long this short vagary strikes me as, say, not vital; though Mr. Bowen's thought is habitually so lucid and econo- mical that he must have imagined it was. The play is done on a horrid 23rd-e1ntury lecture stage, designed by Brian Currah, we, the audience, being the students at the lecture. The lecturer, who stands at a leotern at one side of the stage, is admirably played by Robert James' he is exactly the kind of lecturer f sores for the 23rd century, in this terrible college where every activity is compulsorily voluntary, Alec McCowen adds an extra layer of ghastliness to Arthur by giving him the hard-weak face of a disappointed schoolmaster and an accent full of impure vowels and hard \"I's\" (\"I wiwwwd It I\" he cries in nasty triumph). Of the other men, Anthony Oliver makes a nice job of the Captain, who subsides Into a thumb-sucking second childhood; Douglas Sheldon Is pleasantly dumb as Tony; Alan McNaughtan Is a fine example of those near-agnotic parsons that are beginning to proliferate in the established Church: and William Marlowe gives a full round picture of Alan, the rebel whose courage tends to desert him In moments of crisis. ThBe Idles have less limelight, but Valere White Maureen Pryor and Barbara Young display adequately the lngle chaagoterlitlc personallties of the aotriss. thi But first I must explain how Mr. Bowen contrives to present this world predicament on the stage.

S I- V :1 V I, S I a c V C V I- ii a C C e V r. f a It h d 0 I- B' 0l Thirty yea rssince Sooj thirty years since Guernt aicand the Alcazar and. the. Inter bational Brigade. And thirty years of living with the myths of a war which is-or is not quite-over. That, in a most inadequate nutshell, is the back. ground to the new film by Alain Resnais, La Guerre est Finie, at the Cameo Poly. It is a theme whose tentacles reach out in all directions, not least towards a raging romantic nostalgia. But Resnais lets these ghosts rest. With characteristic unpre- dictability-he is a director who hates his new film to' look too much like his last one-he releases his characters from the clouds of memory which hung about them in Muriel. For the first time, one can say that a film by Resnais is not about the haunting pressumes of the past: except in so far as the Spanish war is part of' the memory of this century. His leading character, Diego (or Domingo, or Carlos, depending on whom he is with and what part he is playin), is a courier between the Spanish exiles in Prance and the men who run the illegal print- ing presses and face the arrests and prison sentences in Madrid. On the French side of the border, the exiles' campaign looks like a tired fantasy: an endless planning of general strikes which are never going to happen. On the courier% part, it means facing -an interroga- tion at a Spanish frontier post, with a borrowed passport and a moment's blank forgetfulness of the telephone number you are claiming as your own. Diego (Yves Montand) is a man living precariously on this frontier; living by evasion, but still closer to his own kind of truth than the exiles who hate reality because it shows so little evidence of con- forming to thejr dreams. And to get to this point, Resnais and the writer Jorge Semprun encourage in Diego a degree of sheer introspec- tion calculated to irritate people whose first demand of fiction is respect for naturalistic fact. There are few secret agents, one supposes, who would say that they would rather have been writers-and then add, ruefully, \"like everybody else.\" But Diego's sensibility is of the kind Henry James gave to his arlarchists in The Princess Casa- massima. He knows more than perhaps he should about his situa- tion, caught between the cause only half believed in and the escape into normal life. And it is the something more he knows that makes his drama La Guerre est Finie is altogether a film which keeps providing some- thing more. On one level, it's a quite workable and plausible thriller: an affair of clandestine encounters, plainclothes policemen hanging about street corners, a motorist, stopped for driving with- out lights when he happens to be carrying a suitcase full of ex- plosives. At another level, it's about the relationship between Diego and two women: the mistress (Ingrid Thulin) who wants him to give it all up; and the girl La Guerre est Pinie is altogether s h d 0 J. d i- d ir ir 3. La Guerre est Pinie is altogether a film which keeps providing some- thingmore. On onelevelit'sa quite workable and plausible thriller: an atrair of clandestine encounters, plainclothes policemen hanging about street corners, a motoriststopped for driving withÂ· out lights when he happens to be carrying a suitcase full of ex- plosives. At another level, it's about the relationship between Diego and two women: the mistress (Ingrid ~hulin) who wants him to give it all up; and the girl Yvette Etevant and Yves Montand he happens to meet because he is travelling on her father's passport and for whom he is a real, live romantic spy. (She calls him Domingo-Sunday. \"It's Sunday,\" he says to her on the telephone with heavy middle-aged playful- ness. \"No, it's not,\" she says irritably, \" it's Monday.\") And on another level again, the film is about political action, and the stratagems by which exiles per- suade themselves they hold the keys to power. The way these levels interlock owes a good deal to Yves Mon- tand's air of knowing everything about how it feels to be Diego. Montand looks inescapably like a Frenchman: leathery, philosophi- cal, more detective than revolu- tionary. But there is in the performance something left out of most of the spies in most of the spy movies: a professional blend of fatalistic acceptance (there is no real coming in from this cold) with an alertness to whatever may be going to happen in the next second. The secret agent neatly separating his Spanish from his French money -preparing, as it were, the expense account for the spy trip-looks the complete master of his trade. But his trade is to live on his nerves. It is in showing what Diego is thinking, and why, that Resnais adds the fourth strand to this elu- sively beautiful film. Early on, Diego is travelling to meet a girt he has never seen, hurrying to catch a train he may miss. Resnais flashes on to the screen the briefest shots of half a dozen girls walking down the same street; three or four versions of just catching or just missing a tram. There's apprehen- sion and professional weariness but also exhilaration: an adven- ture is on. And although the mech anics are necessarily elliptical, there's nothing about them to con- fuse. One knows where one is in Diego's mind, and that it is Diego's mind and not conceivably (as in Marienbad) some speculation snatched out of the air. * Such fugitive flashes work almost subliminally. Harassing, beautiful, urgent, occasionally funny (as when Diego preposter- ously envisages the maid rummag- ing in a cupboard to unearth his explosive suitcase), they hook them- selves on to the mind, like the face or incident seen for a second from a moving train, unfinished instants out of other people's lives. Subliminal, for want of a better word; and dramatically authorised by the fact that Diego is a man trying to come to terms with illusion. The conspiratorial meet- ings of tough young activists who would like to plant bombs in the Spanish tourist buses, and who tell Diego that objectivement he's an old-fashioned romantic, nourish illusions of another kind. For Diego there are. the dead myths of revo- lutionary action; and what he gradually realises is his inescapable commitment to the twentieth- century profession of secret agent. Resnais makes this commitment stick. At the end, a man about to leave for Spain dies suddenly, and Diego's vision of his funeral shifts from flat, grey Paris to a dream of a bleached-white graveyard by the sea in Spain. He takes on the man's errand, knowing that his own cover has probably been broken He is, in the end, what he is. The last shots are of an unfinished journey, with all those inescapable intimations of speed and anxiety-cars on blank roads, a walk down an endless airport cor- ridor. Objectivement, old-fashioned and romantic. But not the way Resnais superbly times it, with each shot lingering in the air like a question mark even after the film has answered the questions.

   "text_content" : "by BEN WRIGHT ,, ..., ';,' .:' *, - ' * ' ' . In weathwr aCt pluctuated as rpidly ua the fortunes of the paz. tldcpant, Ke NagI. (68, 74-142) of Australia lost his lead at the half.way uageYin the Carling World Golf Championship at Royal irkdale, Southport, as the shadows engthend last evening-but only by the narrowest of margins. Bet Yancey,a fresh faced young man from Florida, brought in a reord- :qualling 68 for a total of 141. Grouped behind Nagle are four men on 143 two of whom Peter Butler (70, 7) and Nell Coles (71, 72) are British. Completing the threatening quartet are another Australian, Bruce Devlin (73, 70) and Mike Fetchick, a New Yorker who retired from tourna- ments ten years ago, but who turned in an impressive 69 yesterday. Yancey joined the American cir- cuit only three years ago after suffering a nervous breakdown at West Point Military Academy, where he confessed with alarming frankness to have been found call- ing a baton a golf club. After nine months of medical treatment, he was discharged and turned back to golf-his first love. For 3% years he had been' un- beaten on the Academy golf team. He enjoyed immediate success as a professional and this year has already won two tournaments, the second-the Memphis Open-with a record score of 265. Last evening his golf was impec- cable. He hit the first green, 493 yards away, with a drive and 8 iron for a birdie. Three putts on the second cost him a five, but with putts of six feet, 15 feet and 25 feet he added three more birdies at the third, fifth and seventh holes to be out in 33. His homeward half of 35 was made possible only by a run of four birdies over the last four holes. At the 15th he holed from 15 feet. And then he enjoyed the kind of luck that potential cham- pions must have. He pushed his r r I id il U 1' y t a Is le 3, S s I, i) le 0 Ã½h lo. p9 Ir- :r It i. il Id 3- is ie :h' c- >3 ,n ie ;h et ie 1C is Js ir ie ii- is Â·: Kel Nagle t a id drive far into the bushes, but the h Sball clattered about and dropped : against the fence, which allowed I him a free drop in the well-trodden 7 a sand. u is Billy Casper (147), the American a ie Open Champion, progressed as h neatly as ever until the final two I holes, which he uncharacteristically c- three-putted for sixes and a 74 1.

On the same total is the South African Harold Hen- ning, who limited his score to 74, although afflicted by a bout of hooking. He hit a fairway for the first time at the 13th hole and after that only two more. Now eights and nines were be- oiing commonplace on the giant scoreboard. Bruce Crampton. of Australia, suffered one of the latter : at the short 12th. where he cut a forlorn figure as he aimed six violent blows at his ball, lodged high in the jungle before eventually moving it. Dan Keefe, of the U.S., brought in a splendid 72 to join the group on 145. This would have been better had not the rain suddenly obscured his glasses at the last hole, where he suffered the fearful shank, Devlin played the most extra- ordinary round, which included nine 3s, a 6 and a 7. He holed putts of 12 feet for birdies at the second and third hole. but missed from only a foot at the fifth. A% the sixth he missed from 6 feel after being bunkered and attempted to tap in the ball backhanded- he missed. Along came Bernard Hunt with his second immaculate round of 72. which he described, as he usually does describe his rounds, as \"just steady.\" He was joined on the total of 144 by Terry Dill, of Texas, whM might have been sharing the lesai last night. He hits the ball almost too far for his own good. He did so at the 17th. In attempting to avoid the monstrous hill on the left he pushed his ball far into the jungle where he found it unplay- able. The hole cost him seven; and a total of 73. Coles and Butler, with their two vastly different styles, played similarly steady rounds, as one expects of them and one can but hope that they will stay in a challenging position to-day, whe: there are 82 qualifiers at 151 afi better for the final two rounds.",

As I put my cards down I smiled at her and said: \"A slight d overbid, but I am sure you will p play it well.\" 1I West led the eight of hearts, tc which went to the ten and Ace. 1 South laid down the Ace of Spades. 1 which is reasonable, but when she played a second spade to the King 1 I stopped smiling. East, who is actually squeezed at trick 3, chose to discard the four of clubs. South played a small club from the table, and East won with the Queen, returning the Queen of diamonds. South took her Ace, and played another dia- mond to the King, West letting go a club. The ten of diamonds lost to East's Knave, and South dis- carded a heart. Now East led the King of hearts, which was ruffed on the table, the ten of clubs covered by East's Ace was ruffed by my partner, and I smiled once more. Not the way that I would have played it. but setting up the club King was ex- cellent-I must give her a good write-up. Another heart was ruffed in i dummy and, smiling happily, I picked up my pencil, ready to score 120 below and '700 above. Then to my horror my partner's hand i touched not the King of clubs, but the eight of diamonds, and I knew how Henry the First had felt. My partner had failed to notice the Ace of clubs come down! Let us go back to trick 2. TI'e best play is to lead the five of clubs and cover any card that West plays. This early play of the club avoids putting all the eggs in one basket and leaves the way open for either the long-suit plan or the cross-ruff. East's best return is the Knave of trumps, which runs to the King-the reason for not play- ing the Ace will appear. Now comes the Ace of diamonds and a diamond to the King. It does not help West to ruff and play a trump. With the 5-1 diamond break South must abandon the long-suit plan and embark on the cross-ruff' A club is ruffed in hand and a heart in dummy, the last club is ruffed. and a second heart ruffed on the table. Now a diamond is led and ruffed with the Ace of trumps, and another heart is led. West is unable to prevent dummy's ten of trumps from making by an en passant coup.",
