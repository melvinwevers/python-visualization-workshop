   "text_content" : "]By Our Poitlcal Correspondent After more than three hours of confusion during which the light to Rhodesia was postponed, the Primb Minister last night fisally authorised the departure for Rhodesia of Mr. Bowden, the Commonwealth Secretary, and Sir Elwyn Jones, the Attorney General, and they took off at 11.36 p.m. They are due to arrive in Salisbury to-night to explain the Government's proposals for a settlement to \" all sec- tions of Rhodesian opinion \" including Mr. Smith. The decision to allow the RAF Comet to take off from London Airport was reached by Mr. Wilson after he had asked for clarification from Salisbury of an unexpected statement made by Mr. Smith earlier in the evening which seemed to indicate that Mr. Smith might be demanding recognition of his illegal regime as the condition for allow- ing the two Ministers to land in Salisbury. Mr. Smith in his statement said: \"1 wish to emphasise that I've agreed to this visit on the under- standing that it is a continuation of talks at Government level, i.e. the British Government to the Rhodesian Government. In the present circumstances there can be no deviation from this principle.\" Statement from No. 10 A statement from 10 Downing Street just before 11 p.m. said that Mr. Bowden and Sir Elwyn Jones would be leaving for Rhodesia as soon as possible. It said: \" Her Majesty's Govern- ment have seen the statement made this afternoon in Salisbury by Mr. Ian Smith. \"The purpose of the visit to Rhodesia by the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney General remains as indicated in the state- ment issued yesterday, \"As has been mde clear throughout, all discussloni which the.Commonwealthb4eortfay havein Rhodesia will be conducted under the aegis of the Governor, and the visit in no way constitutes any change in the attitude of Her Majesty's Government towards the regime in Rhodesia. \"The Commonwealth Secretasry and the Attorney General will leave London to-night.\" The Government's first reaction to Mr. Smith's speech was that he was insistinp on recognition of his illegal resgime-as he did last January when Mr. Bottomley's visit to Salisbury had to be can- celled because of Mr. Smith's last- minute insistence on this point, Late last night it was still by no means clear whether Mr. Smith had \"clarlfied\" his earlier statement bqfore the two Ministers left for Salisbury. It Is understood that Mr. Wilson gave Mr. Bowden clear- ance for his visit after a \" reassur- ing \" message from the Governor, but it is still possible that the Min- sisters will fitnd the controversy over recoinnltion of the Smith regime revived when they are in Salisbury. \"Not Negotiation\" says Bowden At London airport just before the take.off Mr. Bowden told reporters: \"While we are In Rho- desia we hope to see a arest many peop, leaders of opinion and, f r. Smith, who Is a leader of opnion wishes to opne along and talk about the piosltn, we shall discuss It with him. But this must not in any way be thought to be negotiation;\" Questioned about Mr. Smith's statement, Mr. Bowden said: \"You will appreciate that the whole thing is rather delicate.\" Asked if there had been clarifica- tion he said: \"We had some messages from Salisbury and our people in other parts who are closer to Rhodesia than we are. On the basis of these messages we are going out.\" It is understood that Sir Morrice James, -the Commonwealth Office official who was sent out to the Governor last week was asked to obtain immediate clarification of the implications of the statement from Mr. Smith's offitials. Talks shrouded in secrecy The 'pecise intentions of Mr. Bowden an Sir Ejn have all the time been arefully shiouded by thu 0kve00s eat. tiinits l aid wsd ft consult their host, Sir Hum hreyo Oibb, before finally formulating thefjtplans. At their meetiing with Mri Wilson at 10f Downing Street on Saturday, they were strongly advised to ' play t by ear.\" It was clearly their hope to have talks with Mr. Smith, anid with Mr. Josiah Gondo, Leader of the Parliamentary Opposition, and other leading fiures in Salisbury- and also If possible with the AfrI can Nationalist leaders in deten tion, Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Sithole. Meeting with Smith not essential How precisely this might be done by Mr. Bowden and Sir Elwyn was a subject which officials were refusing to discusu. In Whitehall it was not even granted that a meeting with Mr. Smith would have to take place before any progress could be made towards settlement; It was argued, for example, that all con. tacts with Mr. Smith could con- civably be limited to meetings be- tween him and the Governor- with Mr. Bowden and Sir Elwyn remalning In the background.

Two key meetings next week will inluence, possibly decisively, the attitude of tens of thousands of car and component workers over the redundancy or work-sharing issue.

But, since BMC manage- ment has not yet told union officials of the impact of short-time on a -plant-by-plant *basis, policy may have to be developed from Sppositwion, rather than. fct the originally as ted by BMC there are fears that the number will grow beyond the estimated 50.000 maximum in the next- two or three weeks. A further so far undisclosed number is bound to be affected at the bhif-dozeb Pressed Steel Fisher bodymaking plants employing 21,000. Officially only the Swindon plant, employing 6,000 has been mentioned as likely to be involved in short-time working immediately, but there are uncon- firmed reports that plants in Birmingham are also affected,",

   "text_content" : "by LEX Not all the blue chips have fallen into quite the same hole as the ICI price has this year, one exception being British Insulated Calleiden Cables which has come out rather better than average with a 141 per cent drop from the peak. But then if you want defensive qualities BICC is better endowed than most. Overseas Profits For one thing it has managed to buck the trend towards declinin, profit margins in recent years. gnoring 1939 when the cable price war had a nasty effect on profits the group turned in a steady, if un impressive, 10-11 per cent on net capital employed until three years ago when ie rate took off rising to 15.7 per cent. in 1965. Closely tied up with this improvement are the overseas companies accounting for some 30 per cent. of sales, 30 per cent. of capital employed and 32 per cent. of net profits. It is easy enough to see problems in the U.K. to set the return on capital employed going in the re- verse direction. Railway electrifil cation is petering out and the CEGB's high voltage transmission programme will presumably be drawing to an end in the next year or two. Neither will cheer up the group. Although 40 per cent. ol the U.K. sales are non-cable, the construction side is closely tied to the cable business and in any case it is in cable that the real profits lie. Moreover the higher the volt. age the better the profit, for the r. and d. required thins the com- petition and improves the anargins, Of equal significance to the UC.K side is that it is in cables where BICC dominates the scene and therefore even if business does slow down to some extent the group can dictate the pace.- Moreover It can bump up exports asi it has already shown.

Cash Problem The importance of Metal Manu- factures and its largely uncharged assets is all the greater for the way that group capital expenditure, though toned down, is still running at Â£17m. or more, against the Â£10m. cash flow. The cash in the last balance sheet was not sufflicient to cover the gap so it looks as though the group will be in the market for capital this year. How. ever at least It has three choice- the U.K. Australia or Canada. Very little will have to be pro duced to justify the 12.8 times PB ratio and the 5,6 per cent. yield, Certainly the U.K. side will tend to slow the group down.

Since the chairman hias not bothered to say whether the' rate will be more normal this year,.\" there remains an alternative. m- the 11.3 per cent. tax rate earming are 27.8, but after a normal 40 per. cent charge they are only 16.7- per cent Thus at 13s 10%d the Ordi- nary are either selling at ten times j* earnings, and are relatively chieip, or 16.7 times and relatively dear. The problem is compounded by various others that also depend on the tax charge. Lister's sptread through woollens and worsteds. hand knitting wools, crimplene, and so on, should promote stability. However, the share price is looking for more than that:. which raises the problem of when the group will use the Â£3m. facillty with ICI to prove the point.' This cash can only be raised by the issue of equity to ICL Plainly there is something to be-said for having a tied customer for rights and if Lister's tax charge stays wher6 it is, raising cash by such issue would be less expensive than loan stock. On the other hand if ICI belives.in ave aging t is gin to be particular about the subsc tion price it pays for a seconI dollop of equity having paid 22s a share for the first dose. More. over, if the tax ratio goes up Lister, with plenty of room for a or - charge, will presumably mink twice about letting ICI have mot. equity. Rights Issues The confusion that has been aroused by the change ia the Con* 'trol oforrowing Order, 1958 and the Treasury's indication that \" consent is likely to be refused for most rights Issues by overseas resident companies\" has been maximum. Yet the actual position is simple. The Control of Borrow- ing Order naturally applies only to the borrower, that is the com* pany making the rights issue. It does not restrict the action of the shareholder. Thus if a shareholder wants to take up his rights there is nothing to stop him paying the price and using investment dollars to do so. Investment trusts have never been stopped from switching and as long as they continue to wnrk wKithin th. u .1\" l# - I restraint, they presumably are un- affected. What machinery, other than the Capital Issues Committee, there exists to enforce the order on borrowers is not clear ut th check at the other end tof :l equation ift necessary s plainly the regular list of dealings in invest. ment dollars prepared by the authorised depositaries.",

Fourthly, an economy campaipn which is producing substantial savings duria the current yr and flf the Maet on dividends of the, ficAct I965. I fl thait I mast. however, repeat what I wrote on modrnisa- tion. If I may, I will quote, sub- t to the endment I have Meetly ese~tk vdipo for * of con- mnea8y to py for it. When one tea and modern factoriek and new maLhto rIt sonms extraordinarily 4h6 itWd for the Indian r\" to put the Tea itry n such a position; that rpid, and I repeat rapid, moderni- stlon is not possible. .Lord Bridgeman and Mr. Magor in New allil and I in Shillong tried our hardest to convince those concerned that all was not well with many estates in Assam, and we were most courteously received, but I fear that the truth has not really sunk in, for devaluation of the Rupee, whatever its other effects may be, might have given us the extra rupees we,. require for modernisation, had they not to a large extent been siphoned off by te withdrawal of the Export Credit sdipie, and the imposition of an Export Duty of no less tfan RL. 2.1- per kilo.\" To sound a slightly more cheer- fdl note, the latet position is that crops in August again show in- creases compared with 1965 and thi figures to the end of that month Tbee figures have beew achieved -ithout in a .y way lowering our standards of placking and manu- facture.

   "text_content" : "GoverwnmOnt Should \"-r4eM- says Mr. Dog *The Thirty-ninth Annual General Meeting of Vaux and Associated.wesies- Liai-d was wheldo . Friday 16th September 1966 at the Seaburn Hotel. Sunderland. The Chairman said;- The year under review ril, I was lot AnA one for o rm .th . more moiny from our b\" sttm amount of our products while some of our local employment, particularly in Coal Mines, has been running down beforealtlftve Ã½'ork has been tbedlÂ»dW;in. te I M - we spro b#t0t awlas.n o09F.; itrnove Ã½ sflicient to taour profits or to produce the annual increase -to which we have become accustomed. Almost all our expenses rose during the year and it has become an unfortgnate.trend in mosr UsPl- nesses to expect and to accept that everything wl' cost more whether it is from one's own increased costs or from increased charges made by outside% supplieris, .- '' DUring the year we experienced a partial but serious strike in our Sunderland Transport Depart- ment which should never have happened and is a typical instance of the harmi which a few irrespon- sible employees can do to the Company who provides their bread and butter. In this instance there was no dispute with the Company 'but the Company was. used,to try and force a very small number of drivers. to join the Transport and General Workers' Union. On the brighter side\" 4e have completed the building or modernisationiof 28 licensed premises, all of which are to serve the needs of new housing areas and the movements of the population. We have under construction 6 others including a 50 bedroom hotel in the suburbs of Glasgow which is scheduled to be completed in the late Autumn of 1967. Owing to the favourable siting of this hotel it should have a very bright future particularly in catering for local functions. It is essential to the prosperity of the Company to follow movements of the population to new areas and we have a number of projects going through the rather tedious chain of permits from the planning authorities, the building authorities and the Licensing Magistrates but the question of completing these projects at prices at which they can be profitable is becoming increasingly difficult owing to the rising costs of building. One simple instance of this is the Selective Employment Tax of 25/- per week on a building labourer working 40 hours which represents an additional 7%d. per hour and adds 10% to the labour charge of any new building. The additional capital expenditure which you will see in the Balance Sheet as being Â£1,585,000 'divides into Â£1,060,000 for new and additions to licensed premises which we expect to earn more money and Â£525,000 for alterations and improve- ments to our breweries and plant, some of which will produce savings in expenses but'much of it is spent to keep up with the changing methods of our trade, such as the containers now used for the supply and distribution of draught beer. It is only a very few years since coopers who repair wooden beer barrels were at such a premium that special inducements had to be offered to retain them. Now in Scotland we have ceased to use any wooden casks at all and the highly skilled craftsmen who were employed in their repair must change to other occupations. Our draught beer in Scotland is now. solely distributed in metal casks and the next step in the proress of distribution is to carry the beer in large bulk containers and then pump it into fixed tanks Whici is being done in licensed premises where the turnover is large enough. The demand in England for beer brewed in Scotland continued unabated and we now transport the major part of this from Edinburgh to Sunder- land in bulk containers similar to the one in the picture which accompanied this year's report and .accounts; this has enabled a considerable-uduo- tion to be 'made in the number of people who handled ther wooden cvsks;' Of our profit for the year, Â£1.546,919, we are recommending the payment of 8% final dividend to make the same total payment of 14% for the year and owing to the temporary tax position we are able to carry forward in the Company Â£355,692 but this retention would be less by Â£134,000 in a full year of the present tax basis. As you know, on *the advice of our Accountants, we did increase the interim payment of dividend from 4 to 6 percent, in order to tale advantage of thb prevailing tax situas iho and qobtain for the Company some tax saviog. The picture let CO d:u' C others like it is Sa e7sy a of company tax which was introduced St of 1965 ia much more revolutlonryv m t , than many eple have realised because the full efect will not be apparent until 1967 Under the new system, income whicih is earned by the money which shareholders, invest in the Company wll pay-tax twice over. First, Corporation Tax adI~dtm, the portion which they choose-to pay as disiden to mse as a irsult of their investment will ter toaed all over again at the full rate of Income Tax so that for each 20/- of income before tax which a shareholder takes out he will pay &/- (Cor- poration Tax of 40%) and also 5/- (Income Tax at 8/3d. on 12/-) before he receives any cash at all. The position for the Company is equally diff- cult because the date of accounting for tax deducted from dividends and interest has been substantially advanced and the Company must find this addi- tional capital which in our case amounts to nearly LÂ£% miillion. Turning to the Selective Employment Tax it may well be that the Company will recover most of the tax on the production side but this only happens at a much later date and as we must pay the tax weekly we again have to lend money to the Government interest free. On the retail side where we have many more employees the tax has to be paid out of our revenue and therefore will impose an additional. cost to us and consequently an additional charge to the con- sumer and a rise in his cost of living. The Government's behaviour in recent tmnes-to the Brewing industry under the Prices and Incomes control does seem quite incongruous particularly when they 'mphasise the importance of kdeping down the price of beer in Public Bars which they class along with bread as one of the most important items in making up the cost of living index. In the 1966 Budget they introduced the Selective Employment Tax which came into effect on the 5th of September and will impose a heavy burden on the retail side of the industry but as the date for the introduction of this additional tax drew near the Minister of Agriculture made the strongest pleas to the industry not to pass on the tax because it would increase the cost of living; this plea would have been more reasonable if the Government had not itself increased the price of. beer and thereby the cost of living by its deliberate imposition of the 10% additional tax on 20th July. While I have every sympathy with the Government's campaign to keep down and reduce costs I think that It would be more .acceptable- if they showed signs. of co-operating with industry Instead of alway9 asking industry to co-operate with them and If they showed signs of reducing their enormous number ofof-cals at the same time as they are asking industry to reduce the number of their employees. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL You will see from the summary of consolidated figures in the Accounts the additional capital which has been needed year by year to finance the Com- pany's progress and the amount required has grown rather than lessened because of the increased costs of building'and the higher prices demanded for new purchases of. property and equipment. Until now this capital has all been found by profits put back into the Company and from money obtained on fixed income security but now because the relation of equities to priority borrowing has become out of proportion we have offered to our ordinary share- holders the right to take up additional ordinary shares at par and I hope that in the long run this will prove beneficial to them all. These additional shaftrs will bring Â£970,000 to the Company. Looking to the future my letter to Shareholders of 23rd August, 1966 which accompanied the offer of additional shares said that subject' to the absence of unfqreseen circumstapces we hoped to..be able to pay the same dividend next year as we recom- Smenifr the past year. Despite a great deal of intrfrnce with the spending power of our customers and the changing face of industry in our trading area the recent optimistic report' of the North East Development Council would appear to indicate that there is reasonable hope of better times ahead for the north. Finally . would like to thank all members of the staff and licensees for their work on behalf of the Company during the year. The Report and Accounts were adopted.

'Mr. R, L. Og, a director of Olyn, Mills and Co., has carried out A valuable servey of the posi* 4too of banks against the back* ond of the container-hip revo- tion. Glyn Mills recognises that the through-travel concept of container ships, with goods carried in con- tainers by a number of carriers-- road, ral and sea-produces a number of problems for banks, who do a huge amount of financ- ing of goods in transit . Banks are anxious to extend the scope of the service they provide for their customers but at the same time must protect their own posi- tion. Bills of Lading The traditional situation is that banks will only accept Bills of Lading issued by, or on behalf of, a shipping company. Banks, says Mr. Og in his survey, cannot reasonably be expected to accept any document pur- YÂ·. 'Â· '~~ porting to be a Bill of Lading unls fact a document which imposes a contractual liability upon the carrier of the goods and whic represents the goods so that possession tof the docu- ment is equivalent to pouemlon of the goods \"It seems clear from our itvesti- gatlons that a fundamental problem on each side of the Atlantic is to devise suitable documentary arrange. monts to enable the full benefits of containerisation to be enjoyed \" In particular, the development of a Through Bill of Lading in a form acceptable as security for bank advances is of paramount Importance. It may be easier to find a solution in Europe than in the U.S., where the existence of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Marl time Commission, with their sharp demarcation, creates a fundamental legal difficulty not present in Europe.\" On this question of bank financing of containerised goods in transitMr. Ogg says that, in spite of all the dis. cussions that are taking place both in the U.S. and in Britain, \"only limited progress has so War been achieved.",

For 1970 output is put at a total value of Â£395m., of which l100m. will go for export, compared with Â£265m. and Â£63m. res- pectively in 1965. Over the five years imports are expected to grow from Â£39m. to Â£71m. The main problems the industry Mill have to face during the next four years are to maintain its ability to compete against U.S. in- dustriae, to weather the flattening- out of military buying, and accelerate the switch-over to the use of micro-electronic circuits. To achieve this there will have to be closer working between in- dustry and the Government in the selection of the right products for development and manufacture. At the same time, while the Ministry of Technology's lead in this area is important, it is equally vital that industry should come forward with ideas and practical co-operation.

It recom- mends the introduction of an added value tax. Explaining that this tax derives its name from the fact that it I levied on the value which a com- pany adds to its products, th pamphlet says it should replace corporation tax and selective em- ployment tax. It would be much more effective in securing rapidly increasing pro- ductivity and exports, and just as effective as a revenue raiser, states the pamphlet-\" A tax for our time.\" \" Added value tax is a tax on costs and will therefore encourage reduc- tion of unit costs. This wil lead to increased productivity both directly and through the release of resources. Added value tax is also rebated on exports and levied on imports.\" A Hindrance it concludes that to tax profit hinders it from performing its econo- mic function as, a measurement of and reward for efficiency. \" By contrast, to tax costs and by rebates to increase the relative profit- ability of exports will ensure that the profit motive serves the precise national purpose. Deflation would be unnecessary because growth would follow a pattern which would ameli- orate our structural balance of pay- ments problem.\" The author, Mr. Anthony Mitton. rejects the conclusion of the Richard. son Report on types of turnover tax that an added value tax should not be introduced. He says it mistaken- ly regarded added value as a tax on consumption and not on business costs. \"This initial wrong analysis makes much of the Richardson Re- port irrelevant to the case between profits and costs taxes,\" he asserts.",

One of the biggest problen n improving the public image of the building industry is it agmentedon inate difrent profession :ad kDlifh These are rarely encootered or understood by the pubic who uos1ly mly eestoe of the thousands ofuall cocmeras . canryim out onl flebfi. a nd ueiwpairw work,: These probemns were outlined -at a meeting &o the junior liaison organisation of builders, 'surveyors and architects at the week-end by Mr. L. J.LHolloway, past president of the National Federation of Building,Trades Employpra. He claimed that there was a \"national built-in reluctance to give building contractors and their men the credit which is often patently due to them.\" Inefficient Concerns \"Official circles\" recognised the improved productivity and efficiency which hag developed in the last few years among most building companies but the general image suffered from the many thousands of small concerns \"ill equipped, ill managed, and in- efficient\" which worked where \" the public can see for themselves their sins and omissions.\" \"The hindrance to improved building efficiency and consequently to the development of an improved public image resulting from the activi- ties of these enterprises, which cannot be said to have any real roots in our industry, is a chronic problem,\" declared Mr. Holloway. He suggested that the activities of the industry's 25,000 one-man con- cerns should not be included as build- ing companies in statistics published by the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Their rightful place was Mr. L. J Holloway among figures relating to operatives. Between 1960 and 1964 productivity was better in building than in any other major industry, Mr. Holloway contended. \"It was better,\" he declared, \"than mechanical and electrical engineering, metal manu- facture, including iron and steel, ship. building, vehicles, textiles, coal min- ing and transport.\"",

Modern Offices, a user survey by the Building Re- search Station, contains the results of a comprehensive survey of standards of office space and acconimmodation in post-war build ings in the business heart of Lon- don. Field work for the study was carried out in 1961 with the aid of the Government Social Survey. The survey shows that the typical modern office in 1%t9 was already a generally satisfactory place in which to work. The problems that remained include the effects of overheating in summer, poor ventilation and noise, from oad traffic particularly. All these effects \"are interrelated and are frequently the-outcome of the design and construction of the building,\" it is stated. The survey was essentially con- cerned with working areas, and did not cover restaurants and other amenities. \" Modern Offices,\" National Building Studies Research Paper 41, S.O.; 5I net.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Scientific Editor Considerable advances in prefabrication for large buildings are described in Building Research, 1965, the report of the Building Research Station (Ministry of Technology) Steering Committee, published to-day. A 17-storey block of flats in Edmonton was completed in 1965 and during the construction 800 visitors inspected the work. What the station describes as \"battery casting,\" the making of panels in large numbers on a site adjacent to the building instead of in a factory, will be used for some 4,000 dwellings this year. 2-storey Structures A Midlands concern is the largest single developer of the technique, in its case for two-storey buildings. It evolved a design and achieved a rate of output of six dwellings a day within a year of visiting the Edmonton develop ment, which' was built by the Edmonton Direct Labour Organisa- tion under the control of the Borough Architect. The technique is being used on many projects for students' hostels and other university buildings. The National Building Agency proposes to promote adoption of the methods. The station also designed a ventila- tion system, using pvc ducts for the Edmonton building. At the same time, a 200-channel data logger was installed, with the necessary trans- ducers to monitor the use of water as part of a programme of research. A further development during the year was the application of mathe- matics to the forecasting of conditions in the building industry and evaluat- ing the demand for resources. All this involves statistical analysis. Input-output analysis has been under- taken by the station to evaluate the relationship of the building industry to other sectors of the national economy. A detailed physical analysis has been undertaken to study the facts of solar radiation on new curtain-wall buildings. This follows a survey of five years ago when 2,000 occupants of 200 post-war office buildings in London were questioned. Desipn methods of computing maximum in- ternal temperatures have as a result now been devised for office blocks. Other continuing research covers helicopter terminals (heliports), acoustics, windowless buildings and design and planning. In fact, hardly any aspect of modern building is missed inm the wide programme of re- search, both in relation to the U.K. and overseas and other Government organisations.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter The Chartered Land Societies' Committee \" has serious 'reserva. tions\" about some of the proposals of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government's Planning Advisory Group, whose report, The Future of Development Plans, was published last year. The committee is particularly concerned about the group's pro- posal that there should be two levels of responsibility in plan making: the Minister retaining responsibility for policy and general standards (urban and country plans), and local authorities being responsible for detailed land use allocation and environmental planning (local plans). Ground for Conflict It considers such a proposal is neither suitable nor practicable at the present time. \"The present constitution of local planning authorities would make such a scheme a fertile ground for con* fdiet between thj Minister and planning authpri s on the one hand and between planning authorities and the public on the other bseause local planning authorities might well be thought to be judge and jury in their own cause. The committee proposes that local plans should either be sub- mitted to the Minister for approval or to an independent body. On compulsory purchase revision. of powers available to local authori. ties \"may be required to meet modern conditions but any revision should take account of the fact that the compulsory acquisition of pro. pcrty can and does create great nardship upon the individual.\" Memberii'of the Committee are the Royal lastitution of Chartered Sur. veyors.

The report looks' forward to the day when the designers will be able to sit at consoles like large TV sets and draw what they think a new building ought to look like by means of a small light pen. At the receiving end, a computer would balance this design with data about the site, materials to be used And many other details. At present, the report says, there s growing interest in the potentiali. ties of computers in design work and it lists a number of architects who have used this new tool. Apart from this side of the busi- ness, at least 150 consulting engineers and other companies use computers for tasks which range from structural analysis to the design of complicated heating system networks.

   "text_content" : "By OBr Foreiin Staff The value of world exports Increased by more than 8 per cent. in 1965, according to a report on world trade by the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, published last night. This represented a fairly high growth rate for the third year in succession, the report s.ays. In volume terms, the increase was about 7 per cent., against \\ growth of very approximately 6 per cent. in world commodity .output. In other terms, the report continues, the rapid intensifica- tion of world trade noted in 1964, when the volume of exports 'increased by some 10 per cent. and output by only about 6 per cent., did not continue in 1965. This change appears to be the outcome of two contrasting ten- d encies, the report states. On one hand, agricultural production, and more particularly food production, -advanced very little in 1965. while trade in foodstuffs, partly thanks to substantial destocking and to the good 1964 crops in a number of exporting countries, continued to expand fairly rapidly in volume terms. On the other hand. world manu- facturing production increased at about the same rapid rate in 1965 Ã½as in 1964. but there was a marked slowdown in the growth in the volume of world exports of raw .materials and manufactures. in 1965. the deceleration in the rate of growth of exports of manu- factures (including base metals) Ã½was concealed by a significant increase in their unit value while the unit value of world exports of primary products (excluding base metals) declined somewhat. following the significant increase registered in 1964. Nevertheless. the past three years have seen a clear upward trend in the overall price level of world trade, largely under the impact of the re sumption of the increase in prices for manufactures. This stands in contrast with the overall stability pre- vailing between 1953 and 1962. and indicates that domestic inflationary tendencies have started to affect the stability of prices in international trade. The reduction in the rate of growth of trade in 1965 affected both exports and imports of all main trading regions regions in not very different nroportions, according to the report. But only in the case of the exports of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the East bloc was the rate registered well below the longer term average of 196065. EFTA and EEC Since 1959, internal trade of both the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Area has consistently grown at higher rates than world trade, and the same has applied, since 1961. to the Latin American Free Trade Area and the Central American Common Market. The growing regionalisation of world trade was an important feature of the 1%5 developments. but contrary to what happened in the two previous years, it occurred in the context of a general slowdown of world trade ex- pansion, and in particular of slower economic growth in the EEC and EFTA.",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN Typical Monday fare is served up to racegoers to-day at three meetings, and adds fuel to the argu- ment of those who maintain that ithe fixture list is in urgent need of revision. However, though the programme at Windsor is not cal- *culated to set the River Thames on fire, it would appear to provide 'three reasonable bets in the shape of Steeple Aston, Caronbrook and Day Tripper. . Of these, Steeple Aston has yet jto reproduce the form shown when runner-up to Continuation in the Royal Hunt Cup at Ascot. But even so. his most recent perform- ance, when finishing second to Midnight Marauder at Bath last month, suggests that he should be .capable of winning the Reading Handicap (3.0). Caronbrook, a bay filly by ,Gilles de Retz, has run twice this year: first at Newmarket on August 20 when she finished third to Last Case and Pally in the War- ren Place Stakes run over one mile, and second five days later when she was runner-up to Ghyll Manor over 1 4 miles at Yar- mouth. Her trainer is of. the opinion that \\1 miles is her best distance, and assuming that he is correct in this assessment, she ought to win the Royal Borough Handicap (4.0). Day Tripper, a stocky colt by ,Pll;za, out of a Vilmorin mare, Is obviously a tough customer, for he 'has run 12 times already this sea- ,on, What is more, he has been remarkably consistent, having won 'three races, been placed second twice and third three times. Evidently he thrives on racing, and his most recent effort, last Wednesday, when he spreadeagled his opponents in a nursery at Chester suggests that, even with a 7 lb penalty, he is capable of taking the Eton Nursery Handicap Plate (4.30). At Leicester, L. Piggott is likely to put cash in the pockets of his innumerable . supporters by win- ning the Kirby Fillies Plate (2.0) on Field Mouse: and the probability is that he will also score on Old Bailey in the Apollo Handicap (4.30). It is possible, too, that he will be in the winner's enclosure following the Nanpantan Nursery Handicap (4.0) in which he rides Bates, a colt by the sprinter, Kelly, whose ability to stay a mile was demonstrated by a comfortable victory over this distance in a similar type of event at Goodwood last week. However, two that might upset the Piggott applecart here are Wet Leger and Ruddy Duck, either of which might turn up at a good price. Up at Edinburgh, J. Jarvis, who in spite of saddling two winners at last week's Ayr meeting, was no doubt disappointed with the overall results of his annual raid on the West coast of Scotland, may notch a double with Endorsement, who, judged on his running in the valuable Billy Butlin Selling Plate at the Sandown Variety Club meeting on September 3, has an outstanding chance in the Prestonpans Nursery Handicap (30) and with Runnlng Words in th Edinburgl Gold Cup (4.0),",

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter A plea for the exemption of local authorities from capital duty is made by Mr. H. R. Page, City Treasurer of Manchester in an article in the September issue of the Thre6 Banks Review. With the Government making grants to local authorities of we5 over Â£1,200m. a year, and with estimates of local authority stamp duties being in the region of Â£2m. a year, there is \"no real reason.\" Mr. Page claims, why local authorities should not be exempt from capital duty and allowed to make a further streamlining in their borrowing procedure-,-a development that would also bring some telief to the Stamp OfBce. Writing on \"Local Authorities in the Capital Market,\" he points out that between 1959 and 1964 local authdrity debt in the U.K. Increased from Â£6,100m. to Â£8,800m., or by 44 per cent. Nevertheless, only a complete breakdown in the economy is likely to lead to a slowing down in the rate of growth. Despite a good deal of talk about restraint in the public investment sector, he suggests that there has been no attempt yet to cut back effectively in the major spending services- housing, roads, schools, water supply and the major health services. Tracing the steps that have been taken by local authorities to finance their debt in recent years, Mr. Page states that the productivity aspect of debt t0anagement must not be oveWN looked. Local authorities have gone a \" very considerable\" way in streamlIning their borrowing pro. cedures and many of the larger ones already have their loan records and interest payments system computer- ised. But there is still scope for simplifli- cation in the regulations and In the duty ovisions, and to doubt \"other ingenious mids\" will find ways of carrying more work with fewer stafL High interest rates . Local authorities are faced with a series of dilemmas. Government policy and their own inclination urge them to expand, while the Treasury grows incressinly alarmed at local authort int on of the capital market. At the same time, increases in capital development are taking place in a period of high interest rates. In an attempt to meet this critical situatlon, the local suthortlies have von1tt& 2 setde 6( -devicdes al dto which have come up against Treasury and Bank of England restrictions. On top of this, Government depart- ments are increasingly interfering In the detail of local authority capital schemes and restricting the exerci of local discretion.",

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORDON TETHER EVERY EFFORT is now being made to make out that the official decision to push the brakes down on economic growth even harder than ever has been motivated as much by domestic considerations ft.. A. a as by external ones. But the fact that tohe supersut thecial measures programme came only a few weeks after to push Chancellor of the Exchequer had epresslyowth stated that he was still satisfin motivated the diina- tionary actiontakien oi the Budget was adequate leaves no serious room for doubt that the Govern- prognt was stampeded into taking the action ter did by fears for the L And it is a prest pity, there- fore, that the authorities have not been more forthcoming in describ- what was happening on the balance f payments front in those crucial weeks in July. For the impression created by what has been since revealed is that it is questionable whether the situation did really warrant a Force 10 stampede of the kind that developed in Whitehall and Threadneedle Street at this time. The Bank of England in its latest quarterly bulletin agrees that the Government launched a re- trenachment programme far-reachb- ing enough to produce a substantial improvement in the balance of payments. But it is quick to point out that no-ond is to suppose that this means that the I has been defended at the expense of the domestic enconomy. All it shows, we are assured, is that, \" given the extent of the nation's present. ability and willingness to save, we could not afford all we were doing.\" Though it cannot bring itself to deny that \"in the longer run the country's problems will be solved only by an Increase in production,\" we are told that we shall have to understand that the external pay- ments basis needed to allow this process to begin can be provided only by taking action to produce less, not more. Denying itself The theory that the only way in which a country can stop spending too much abroad is by denyin1 itself for a substantial period of time the economic growth which can alone furnish a- real answer to the problem has a nice Alice in Wonderland ring about it. But the point 'that interests me most about this exposition is Why the Bank' shows' itself so very aqxious to make sure that the blame for-the latest policy upheaval is; laid squarely at the door of alleged over-expansion at home. One reason, of course, is that it is well aware that the impending prolonga- tion of the economic standstill, not to speak of the growth of what Mr. Cousins calls' waisteful 'un- employment. is going to lead to the charge being made that the home economy has again been sacrificed for the sake of safe- guarding the City's international banker interests. But I would guess u~uruÂ· rÂ·Â·Â·rÂ·rluÂ· uu~ nuuÂ·uÂ·urJo that there is rather more to it than that-the \" rather more \" consisting in the Bank's suspicion that it might not be all that easy to demonstrate that the deterioration in the sterling markets in July created a situation wherein the Government had to choose between a vast elaboration of the \"stop programme\" and devaluing the Â£. Having regard to the far-reach- ing consequences of the latest policy upheaval, one might have thought that it would have been considered imperative to give a full account of the behaviour of the reserves during the crucial period In. July. But Ministers have one no further than to give broad hints that the growth of selling pressure on the Â£ had assumed devastating proportions. And the Bank of England finds it convenient to be correspondingly vague in deal- ing with the matter in its latest quarterly bulletin. We are told that the selling was heavy in the early weeks of July, while later it is asserted that, by the middle of that month, \"the crisis of confi- dence in sterling had made the need to correct the balance of pay ments unmistakably urgent.\" Un- fortunately, while no-one is going to say that such statements are wild exaggerations it is impossible to be. sure whether they are not merely opinions presented as mat- ters of fact in the absence of full supporting evidence. Not so near The very fact that it has been decided not to provide this could itself be regarded as being signifi- cant-though I imagine that this would be explained away on the grounds that, to have revealed how bad the situation had become even long after the event, would be to impede the L's subsequent recovery. But this apart, the Bank's own account of the build-up of the crisis and the light that has been thrown on the impact it made on the U.K.'s reserves by last week's statement on Central Bankers' credits does contain a strong sug- gestion that the situation had not really moved so near disaster point as we have been led to suppose. Thus, according to the Bank's own story, though sterling was under pressure in June. this was primarily on account of hot money movements provoked by changes in interest rate patterns abroad. And this was still the situation at the beginning of July. Sterling was \" heavily offered after the first week-end in that month and the pressure is renewed at the begin- nins of he -following week, though at thi^time mainly in the forward market, , But it would seem thai the selling only assumed reall; alarming proportions in the inter val of a few days between the ,announcement that' the Govern ment was taking new measures and the unfolding of those measures- implying that the build-up ol anxiety was caused more by th- mounting evidence of insipieni panic in the defence HQ than by 'a sudden unprovoked waning ol confidence In the durability ot 's parity abroad, Well it can, or course, e V that if the Â£ really was attack6 , on a massive scale, the U.I â authorities could not be blamed l for falling over themselves to | capitulate even at such an early , stage in the battle. But was the onslaught of such an order that it threatened -to overwhelm the elaborate defences that were sup. *t posed to have been created to del.;i with a situation of precisely this kind? In the course of demonstrat' ing last week the strong position Britain's reserves had been left q by the new swap credit arrange* meats, the authorities revealed that, apart from the Â£44m. taken from the reserves during July and August to cover the basic deficit in the U.K.'s payments, the total cost dt financing withdrawals of funds&: from London since the end of June has been represented by net draw* ings on the special credit extended. 1 by the U.S. last September and on. the package provided by the Central \" Banks of other countries in June.., Since we don't know what these credit lines total, where they stand now or how far the drawings since the end of June are attributable to movements of funds that have taken place since the Government announced its new programme, itW is impossible to say just how fat: they were running out during the crucial phase. But what is clear is that at the end of this period they. had certainly not been exhausted and that there was still S450m. at least available under the reciprocal U.S. swap credit line. Remember ing that all these drawing rights had been created to enable the U.K. to cope without undue trouble with short-term capital movements, and that the U.K.'s own reserves were still 'comfortably in excess of Â£l.000m., it is hard to see why jt was expected that the Â£ was on th* brink of a disaster from which it could be rescued only by bending over backwards to appease foreign banking opinion. Speedier attack This is not. of course, to say that there was no call for the Government to carry out some re organisation of its economic poli- cies. It had long been evident thit the attack on the core of the pay- ments problem-theinisatisfactory exports'qimports ' relationship - needed to be speeded up, prefer- ably by direct action aimed at bringing imports quickly down to a level the country could afford. And it had also been apparent for a long time that there was going to be little hope of reviving cons? dence in the Â£ so long as the incomes policy had the appearance of being a bad economic oke. But what it does suggest is that, given a' calm and ouragepus approach to the problem presented by the new sterling upheaval, the situation could have been contained without resorting- to measures that are destined to Inhibit the economic growth without which there can be no lasting solution for any of our difficulties.",

   "text_content" : "LAST NIGHTS postponement -and subsequent reinstatement -of the visit of two Ministers to Salisbury is evidence that the first and most minor hurdle in the race against time over Rhodesia has yet to be cleared- let alone the 'major ones beyond. The first hurdle is finding a means by which the British and Rhodesian Governments can talk to one another without the one side being accused of deal- ing with rebels or the other being taunted for giving up its unilaterally-declared independ- ence. Mr. Smith's statement yesterday-that Mr. Bowden and Sir Elwyn Jones were wel- come in Salisbury only as emissaries of one Government to another-can clearly not be accepted by Britain, as the state- ment from No. 10 last night underlined. A question of pace But when this hurdle is finally cleared (as, in all common sense, it should be), there remain the more major ones, including the steepest of all-the question of the pace of advance to majority rule in Rhodesia. It is because so many African Governments suspect that Britain will baulk at this one that the Commonwealth talks were bedevilled last week; President Kaunda's statement yesterday at least confirms that the communique on Rhodesia has succeeded in its immediate aim of warding off African resig- nations from the Common- wealth. Meanwhile the Zambian offensive at the United Nations will go on; the Christmas time- limit for a Wilson-Smith agree- ment stands; and on the other side, the Rhodesian Front is be- ing urged by some of its rank and file to forget Britain and declare a Republic. It is a vicious trap. If Mr. Smith is appeased, the Africans will not be; if the Africans are appeased Mr. Smith might stand, by the side of South Africa's Mr. Vorster, and dare Britain to carry out its pro- gramme of calling on the Security Council to impose selective mandatory economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Thus, as always in this Rhodesian problem, the crux of the matter is South Africa's policy. The newness of his job has so far prevented Mr. Vorster from declaring himself on Rhodesia, but such a declaration might well be forthcoming when he addresses Parliament in Cape Town today. It is a hard decision for Mr. Vorster to have to make. On the one hand it has long been South African policy (in the Verwoerd tradi- tion) to sidestep international quarrels where it is possible to do so. Thus the Republic will be sending a strong team to the United Nations to defend itself against attacks over South West Africa. And a confrontation with Britain is surely something the South African Government must want to avoid as much as does the British Government. But, on the other hand, white public opinion in the Republic is strongly, emotionally, in favour of giving all possible assistance to Mr. Smith's regime. Some newspapers and politicians have counselled caution but there can be no doubt that Mr. Vorster would be going against the general desire of his own party and the people who vote for it if he were to co-operate with Britain in securing the downfall of the Salisbury Gov- ernment. Yet, without the removal of the South African. prop Rhodesia's present Govern- ment will not fall. The dilemma It was just this situation that led Dr. Verwoerd to his policy of giving, discreetly, every needed help to Salisbury while maintaining a public stance of neutrality. At the same time he put a good deal of pressure on Mr. Smith in the hope of bring- ing about talks and a settlement with Britai*. The same situa- tion now prevails, with the exception that Mr. Wilson has said that if there is no settlement by the end of the year British policy will change into one of all-out attack on the Smith regime. There is, as a result, a good deal of momentum towards a settlement. If there is a settle- ment, it might mean that the Commonwealth (or at least its African parts) will, after all, be lost. If there is not one (and this seems the most likely outcome), then Britain will have gone one more step towards a confronta- tioin with South Africa."

   "text_content" : "IT IS SO RARE nowadays to find an academic economist with a good word to say for Mr. Wilson that when someone as distinguished as Sir John Hicks comes out in favour of the Prime Minister's stand on devaluation it is time to sit up and take notice. In a.paper published to. day by the Inastitute of Economic Affairs, Sir John refers to the widespread sentiment that the only reason we do not devalue is the obstinacy of Mr. Wilson, and then goes on to add, \"economists maybe grtefui for the obItinacy of r. 4Uo,.\" Sir Job nakic own main objection to delua* tion is that although Inter, national agreement o a. new parity might be attractive, this is far away, and a unilateral move would be dangerous. Internal revaluetdon Mr. Wilson will, however, be less comforted to fnd that Sir John believes that the alternative -which may have at least tobe considered-is a \"uniform act in all money, wages and prices- an internal revaluation Instead of an external devaluation.\" It is easy to see that such a out which could not be successfully introduced even In the 1920i, si not a workable proposition to. day.

Another possibility might be to out private Investment to the extent required; and with the selective employment tax, and credit restriction this seems to be the way that polloy is working. But Sir John regards this, rightly, as a \"horribly short. term solution.\" In 196243 In. vestreadt fell below what was re- quired to support even a modest expansion of the economy. Yet any attempt this time to push up Investment again, after a fall, would lead to renewed balance of payments orisis, \"a game wich cannot be played again\" after all that has happened, There Is, therefore, nothing for it but to out public expendi* ture programmes, a point which THs FINANCIAL TIMes has already stressed.

This is a concept which looks simple and attractive, but the history of industrial selations over the past twenty years shows how difficult it is to put into practice. There has been a steady de- cline in the number and in- fluence of joint consultative cormmittees. All the effort of workers' representatives, espeo- ially the shop stewards, has gone into the normal process of noeso tiation; the incentive either for them or for management to make proper use of consultation has evidently been inadequate. Change Wanted Yet this discouraging experi ence does not mean the oee- tive is not worth pursuing. What everyone wants is a change in attitudes whereby the coopera- tion of the work force within the factory is enlisted, on a permanent basis, in the search for higher productivity. The great surge of interest in produc- tivity bargaining following the Fawley experiment, is very much to be welcomed, because it repre- sents an attempt by management to take the initiative in eliminat- ing inefficient work practices. But many of these bargains have been \"one-shot\" deals, which have an imnmediate and substantial impact on effciency, but have no permanent effect on attitudes. They are imple- mented, as an American observer, Robert McKersie, has said, \"in a compliance fashion. The changes are not made because the rank and file have Sinternalised' the need for these changes; rather they are made because an effective management organisation and a responsible union leadership ensure that the agreement is honoured. In effect, behaviour changes, but attitudes remain the same.\" Productivity bargaining is a kind of surgery which puts a firm or a plant on a sound footing. It does not provide a continuing programme .for im- proving etliciency over the longer term. Yet the'factors which are crucial to the supcess of a pro- ductivity deal-consultation and participation at every stage and at all evels-sre equally essen- tial in any long-term productivity programme. Recognising Snags At Mobil, one of the few cases where a successful productivity deal seems to be having long- term effects, management \"con- stantly had to remind ourselves of the need to get everyone involved to recognise obstacles which stood in the way of reach- ing the overall objectives, and then to participate in the search for a way round the obstacle.\" Great emphasis is placed on identifying the employee with the objective of the company. \"We do not tell him how it should or must be achieved. We ask him whether hbe accepts the objective for himself If so, we then invite him to work with us freely and equally to find the ways and means by which the objective can be achieved. We call this participative manage. ment, because the employee is part of the whole concept and effort, and likely to be proud of his achievement and participa. tion, which will continue.\" Traditionally firms have en- couraged employees to work harder through individual incen- tive schemes, such as piece-work. The piece-work system can still be effective in certain conditions, but it has a number of disad- vantages. It tends to make the introduction of new methods and new machinery more difficult, because new rates have to be negotiated. The rates themselves are often complicated and lead to unfair disparities in earnings between one group of wotkers and another. The system does not in any sense encourage workers to pull together towards a common goal; it asks merely for more physical effort, not for a collective \" mental\" effort to improve efficiency in the plant. In any case, individual incentives are often irrelevant in highly mechanised plants where a man's output is determined by the pace of the machine. Fixing Standards Some of these disadvantages are eliminated when, a firm switches to measured day work, whereby the employer lays down precise standards to determine how much work the employee must perform; his earnings de- pend on meeting those standards. This has the important effect of forcing the employer to put a great deal of effort into methods analysis and work measurement, and this in itself generally leads to big gains in productivity. Many firms, partly because of piece-work, have lost control over their wage systems; they neither elicit the right kind of effort from the workers nor reward them equitably. A full- scale job evaluation programme ,of the. sort which is pow going 'on in Ford'is an esseitial pre- condition for a sound wages structure. But measured day work still leaves a \"motivational gap.\" The employer can maintain the predetermined pace of work by discipline and coercion; this is acceptable if management uses its authority fairly, but it does not encourage employees to par- ticipate in making the plant more efficient. The employer can re- ward an outstanding worker by promoting him to a better job, but the use of promotion as a motivational tool Is limited by seniority -rules and other union conditions. Neither piece-work nor measured day work can con- tribute to the change in attitudes which might lead to a joint effort to raise productivity. Hence there are obvious ittractions in group incentive chemes, whereby an individual's arnings depend on his contribu- ions to the achievements of a lrger group, or even the plant is a whole. There has been some interest in two American ichemes, the Scanlon Plan and the Rucker Plan. The workers and the company share the gains arising from reduced costs and greater efficiency, on the basis of a formula which relates the firm's labour costs (in the Scan- Ion plan) to its sales value of < prdduction, or (in the Rucker Plan) to the value added by manufacture, allowing for the cost of materials, supplies and services; Rucker is more precisely engineered than Scan- lon, which relies heavily on the effect of the scheme on employee attitudes and on their willingness to participate. Big Influence Both schemes have been applied in a number of plants and some of them have been successful. The use of the Scanlon Plan in Pressed Steel's Linwood plant, though in some senses a failure, was successful enough to have a big influence on the thinking of the rest of the motor industry. This was a e courageous attempt to get away from piece-work and, with the help of a group incentive scheme, to develop a new labour-manage. ment atmosphere in a plant (\"the Paisley slave camp\") where industrial relations had been notoriously bad. The Scan- lon Plan involves the creation of an elaborate network of pro- ductivity committees designed to ensure the participation of every. one concerned. Although the Linwood Plan had an immediate effect of rais- ing productivity and reducing labour turnover, it was probably a mistake to make it a plant- wide incentive. Therp is always a danger in schemes of this sort that the connection between an individual's effort and the award of the bonus will be too remote to have much motivating effect. The same applies even more obviously to profit - sharing, which in general has little in- fluence on attitudes to efficiency. A profit-sharing scheme like that used by Kalamazoo, the Birming- ham office-equipment firm, pro- vides a very real personal incen- tive for the senior executives. But, apart from creatinra vague sense of loyalty and encouraging workers to stay with the firm,'ts effect on the shop floor is iar- ginal. It certainly does not take the place, in this company, of individual incentive schemes. Severe Strains Group incentives can be sue. cessful in creating a better labour - management relation- ship. In the U.S., Kaiser Steel's Long-Range Sharing Plan, in- stalled in 1963, seems to be working well. But plant-wide schemes of this kind need very careful preparation, especially in large companies, and they impose severe strains on manage. ment.

Great effort is needed to keep it working, and it will almost certainly have to be re-ngineered after a few years. Similarly the mere creation of joint production committees with shop stewards as members-or even the admission of union representatives to compan boards-will do nothing by itself to produce a change in attitudes. Some union leaders criticise the separation which has grown up between consultation and nego. tiation (\"a false and harmful distinction,\" according to Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers Unlon) and argue for greater union partiio pation in decision * making.

   "text_content" : "Sir,-The Ministry of Labour has now issued forms SEP I for completion by employers seeking to have their establishments regis- tered as qualifying for premiums or refunds under the Selective Employment Payments Act. On the basis of the registration granted will depend whether the employ- ing company eventually bears a charge of 25s per week for each man employed, pays nothing, or receives a premium of 7s 6d per week. The deciding factor as to whether or not an establishment qualifies for a premium or refund is the percentage of its employees engaged in \"nonqualifying\" acti- vities As so much hangs on the exact interpretation of these acti vities it was to be expected that the Ministry of Labour would de- fine these with some precision. However, neither the form con- cerned (SEP 1) nor the accompany- ing \"Guide for Employers\" goes very far In this direction. The three \"non qualifying\" activities for premium purposes are office work, sales, and tran rt the last of these being excludedl for refund purposes. Office work is defined in some detail in the terms contained in the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 with slight modifications. Sales are defned as \" Activities by way of the galo of goods\" and transport as \"Activities by way of the carriage of goods by road in connection with a business.\" These so called definitions are so va as uto be almost valueless. Whe does the \"activity by way of the sale of goods\" begin-does it Include storemen and packers? Similarly ar vehicle maintenance staff and loaders included under transport? On a more cheerful note It is encouraging to learn that, once ren gistered as a premium or reftund q loifying establishment, the tal Wprocedure for claiming money back from the Ministry where more than 200 employees are concerned could hardly be more straightforward (Method 2 page 26 of \" Guide to Employers \") even if this procedure does result in a loss of about Id.per week for each girl under 18 employed.

To suggest that these two regions are complementary to one another and thus should be deig- nated as one is, I beliew, a mistake. Now that the Severn bridge has been opened, the Bristol-Oloucester industrial district will have even less contact with the western section since It will naturally move much closer to the South Wales industrial region. a fact it Is probable that within the next 20 years Bristol the lower Severn Basin and South Wales wil together forii a very formidable industrial complex whose economic hinterland will cross and completely ignore the regional boundaries as toey are at present designated.

Inflation occurs when the supply of money exceeds the needs of trade at the existing level of prices; but I would not agree that refer- ences to cost inflation merely make confusion worse confounded. Sir Roy EHarrod has, pointed .out that demand pull inflation is a lift of prices over costs while cost. push inflation is a rise of prices and costs. Moreover cost inflation is the more insidious in that it becomes built-in and may indeed linger on when the forces of demand inflation may be weaken- ings. What is more, cost inflation is not amenable to the same weapons of control as demand inflation. Mr. Blundell's assertion that wage increases merely amount to transfers of purchasing power with no net inflationary effect would appear to assume a static situation as the old wages fund theory did. The true position was graphically portrayed by the late Professso. Robertson who said: \"If mone tary authorities are always pre pared to create without question whatever flow of money Is needed to discharge whatever wage bill I needed to reconcile full employ ment with whatever wage rate ! demanded by the trade unions, they have in effect abdicated from exerising that sovereignty ovei the standard of value which we thought we had 'oommitted to theli charge,\" .

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staff OFFICIALS of the Transport and General Workers' Union last night hotly denied reports that the union was dragging its feet on plans to modernise Britain's ports because of the wage freeze. Mr. Tim O'Leary, senior docks officer of the TOWU, said: \"There has been no breakdown in nego- tiations. We are merely waiting for the -next report from Lord Devlin, which is expected by the end of the month.'' Lord Devlin, who chaired the committee which produced list year's major report on the future of the docks, has completed a further report on wage rates to be paid when dock labour is \" de casualised.\" The report is now with the printers. Although the substantial wage sincreases recommended in the report would in any event, be delayed by the freeze, there is little fear that this will produce a violent reaction from the TOWU. Union officials are well aware that thiavlatest D ievulrrpo ' it imrtely the prelude to detailed discus- sions on attaching dockers to individual employers. It will be some months before the first dockers are due to receive the increased rates and by that time the period of absolute freeze will be over. Union officials and employers made a joint approach to Lord Brown, chairman of the National Modernisation Committee for the docks, earlier this month asking when the Devlin report would be available. This was a routine request and not a hint that the Government was itself using delay- ing tactics to avoid. a clash 'with the TOWU. Strike threat A further comiplication has arisen in Liverpool, wherf there have been suggestions of -spon- taneous\" strike' action - against non-unionist dockers on October 1 In addition there have been hints that local decasualisation talks might be held up it the pgob. lem of .non-usionists was nopt 'J\"oWevcr, a rnational offiial of; the TGOW said last night no official decision had been taken about strike action.",

Dr. Erhard wobld like the job to go to a civil servant of his own choosing, and without Minis- teriail rank. The Party: feels differently.

A SURPRISE for critics 'and rundits alike came at the Seventh nterational Industrial Film Festval to-day when Britain won the Grand Prix-awarded to the country with the most placings within the various categories. For some, Including mysolf, it was a surprise because the British entry was not considered a par ticularly good one. True to expectations, however, the Pirelli (Great Britain) flm, The Toriolse and ihe Hare, came first in Its class-and when shown to delegates last Friday, brought the most enthusiastic response wit. nessed at the Festival. Likewise, asiructional Techniques (Part D Visual Aids) by the Ministry of Defence, Navy, also came flrst In its category as expected. One other British film won a first prize In Its category-The Stabl Door (British Insurance Association). Second awards went o Pfhy'sc sand Chemistry of Water (Unilever) and The Nature of Firm (Fire Protection Assoclation), But no British Afim won any of the rate awrds presented by nalipn telsev ion, Industry, Preu and film producers,. ureatest disappointment must go to the French and the Belgiaus, who each had one outstandin flm in this Festival but which a led to win awards. In Au Large du Desert (Ste. Francalse dqs Pdtroles BP), the French have produced a enstratin study of a dying InL dustry-lobster flihing. In LoI Voyageurs (another BP film, but from 'Belgium), a sensitive slim portrait is given of pigeon racing -the pastime of many workers in the region depicted, Many doe- gates are indeed disappointed that these outstanding films were un. recognised by the judges.

   "text_content" : "By JUSTINIAN GAMBLING and gunnery are the latest bedfellowS singled out for parliamentary action in the Oovernment's concerted efforts to cope with crime. The Home Secretary last week confessed to the country's gift to the criminal world by ill-drafted liws' in 1960 which freed the gambler from, former restric- tions. And. at lona last, the authorities have woken up to the excessive laxity towards the control of the sale of firearms. The framers. of the 1960 legislation can hardly have taken note of the American literature which demonstrated the inevitable outlet that gambl- ing gives to organised crime. The Kefauver report of 1951 (The ThirdlInterim Report of the Special Committee to In- vestigate organised crime in Interstate Commerce, named -after its -chairman, Senator Kefauver) pointed an unerring finger to gambling as the prin- cipal support for current big- time rackets and gangsterism. Predatory But the' conclusion of the Kefauver Committee provides little comfort to the legislator. It concluded: - \"The legislation of gambling would not termi- nate the widespread predatory activities of criminal gangs and .syndicates. The history of legalised gambling in Nevada and in other parts of the country gives no assurance that racketeers can be converted into 'responsible businessmen through the simple process of obtaining State and local licences for their gambling en- terprises . . . The Committee has not seen any workable pro- posal for controlled gambling which would eliminate the gany sters or the corruption.\" As long as there are big monetary returns in a particular activity with the minimum of effort crime will penetrate the activity. This fact has dawned on the Home Office, which is seeking ways of reducing the profit accruing to the gaming establishment. Control by licensing is insufficient; a method by which the govern- ment can enforce laws that limit the profit to the organisers will alone be likely to succeed to reduce the criminal element that thrive on the periphery of law ful gaming. If the American experience on gambling is a useful guide to future legislative action in Britain, the control of freams in America has nothing to offer by way of guidance. Laxity there undoubtedly is in England; in America there is positive licence to possess fireams in a constitu- tional guarantee that American citizens shall have the right to arm themselves. The Firearms Act 1965 in England, following a second post-war amnesty for those un- lawfully possessing gun.s, stepped up the penalties. It did nothing to alter the controls that existed. Rifled weapons can be bought only under licence, but smooth-bore guns can be bought as readily as a bar of soap. Victor Terry, who was exe- cuted in 1961 for the murder by shooting of a bank guard at a bank in Worthing. within hours of the incident purchased from a shop in Portsmouth yet an- other shotgun. Although not lethal in themselves, shot-gun when the barrel is sawn off be come as deadly as automatic pistols. And the growing number of cases where young delinquents have employed shot- guns in this way has led to the present mood to clamp down on the facility with which these guns can be obtained. The other outlet of firearms to the criminal underworld are the ones lying harmlessly enough around the homes of law-abiding citizens but are readily accessible to the burglar who has a ready market for the stolen firearm. No Reason There is in fact no reason why a person living in a modern urbanised community should be allowed any firearm. The farmer or the grouse shooter should be allowed under licence to possess a gun in the country. And if the townsman wishes to go shooting in the country for sport there is no reason why his gun should not be drawn out of an armoury provided at the spot where the shoot is to take place. And not only will the unlawful use of guns by our growing criminal population be stemmed. Guns are dangerous toys; and annually accidents of a more or less serious nature occur in urban areas by the unskilled or uncontrolled use of guns. Few therefore will cavil at the Home Secretary's drive to prevent deaths and accidents from the use of guns. Even if we fail to make any significant mark on the evil aspects of gaming, gunnery may soon in Britain be a pastime wholly unknown to the towns. folk."

Finance Minister, will visit the EEC headquarters in Brussels to- morrow. It will be the first visit by Irish Ministers to the Com- munity's capital for stveral years.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF A numbdr of industrial giants are due to make announcements during this week, many of them concentrated on Thursday. Bunched together on that day are the results from \" Emmles,\" Dalgety and N.Z. Loan and London Merchant Securitles. with half-year statements from Dunlop, Vickers, British Roll* makers and Associated Fisheles. and the interim dividends from the Royal Dutch/Shel group. Other well-known names include Rowntree (interim due to- morrow), Calico Printers (results Wednesday) and Cammell Laird (interim Wednesday). Geo. W. King After the severe loss incurred in 1965 and omission of the Ordinary dividend, shareholders of Gen. W. King, makers of mechanical hand- ling equipment, still lack firm guid- ance in the 1966 interim statement True, the improvement in the order position indicated in the report last July is now quantified-orders booked in the six months to June 30 were Â£2.96m. against Â£2.38m.. and orders outstanding were Â£2.67m. against Â£2.03m.-but the implication for profits is by no means clear. Deliveries, it seems, are being delayed into 1967, the factory is not working to full capa- city and tonnage output in the first half-year is \" somewhat down \": the impact of the credit squeeze on the second half has yet to be seen. In this situation, although the Board reiterates hope of a \"signi- ficant improvement\" in the -1966 trading result, it is a moot question whether this can be interpreted as a return to profits or a much smaller loss. Certainly the deci- sion to defer the half-year's Prefer- ence dividend, requiring Â£6,200, is not encouragine and underlines the company's illiquid position: the end-December balance-sheet showed bank overdraft of Â£l1.24m., and some form of funding opera- tion may ultimately be needed. Last Friday the 5s Ordinary lost 3d to 5s. H.P. Sauce Last April the chairman of H.P. Sauce was not hopeful about mar- in the current vear after the isappointing showing in 1965. And the half-time figures give no cause for optimism with pre-tax profits slipping from Â£1.055m. to Â£1.027m. Even assuming the percentage fall Jn profits goes no further in the second half, a figure of around Â£2.008m. for 1966 against Â£2.08IO previously would leave the main tained 17% per cent. dividend covered only 1.3 times by carnins of 22.3 per cent. The company is currently instal- ling a computer in order to autl- mate more of the administrative functions and improve overall efficiency. Ultimately this must benfit the costs structure although it could temporarily have an adverse effect until new systems are running. smoothly. Meantime. severe competition in the retail grocery trade keeps manufacturer.' prices under pressure and it would seem that so far H.P. Sauce has not been able to raise turnover sufficiently to offset this narrowing of margins. But at 14s 6d the yield of 6.1 per cent. on the 5s Ordinary is looking for some improvement. George H. Scholes After pushing pre-tax profits up from Â£449,000 to Â£688.000 in the four years to June, 1964, George H. Scholes saw a rise of only 2%' per cent, in 1964-651 and the 1965-66 results show a continuation of this slower growth rate with a 4 per cent. advance to Â£736.000. But at least the group is keeping ahead despite the squeeze - no mean achievement since Scholei operates as manufacturers of electrical products (fuse gear, switches. etc.) with the house build- ing industry as its main customer. The slowdown reflects rising costs. including non-ferrous metals, and a period of consolidation. In tddition Scholes has been fully occupied with the development of a new miniature circuit breaker which should be on the market shortly. The maintained 27V per cent. dividend- is reasonably covered by earnings of 41.3 per cent. But the 4.4 per cent. yield at 31s 6d-up Is on the day-is looking for stronger growth; the P/E ratio is 15.3:1",

The directors point out that tax changes raise the cost of the interim to almost twice that of last year's, at a time when the company needs to conserve resources to meet the peak period of trading. Accordingly, they have decided to limit the gross amount to approximately the same as last year's net payment. Sales for the first six months of the year dropped slightly, but the directors emphasise that the trade is seasonal and that profit is largely made in the second half. Deliveries and orders booked for the second six months are about level with last year's figures, but with increased competition and higher costs, margins continue to narrow. At this stage it is not possible to forecast the year's results, but, so long as measures taken by the Government do not seriously affect consumer spending on clothing between now and Christmas, the year should be a \"reasonably satisfactory one.\"",

The chairman adds that the com- - pany is \"fortunate\" in that it has no major sites awaiting develop- hment which will have to be delayed by virtue of the new legislation. Consolidation Policy The directors have however, de- cided that the declared policy of con- solidation should be continued, whIle \"taking the opportnlity .of acquiar Ing particularly suitile projects' us The accounts are the first of the reconstructed group following the scheme whereby the company cqired the capitals of Allied Land and Investment and Lambton Close oldings. They show a profit for the period ended March 31. 1966, of Â£436,230 before tax as reported on August 26. In the explanatory state- ment sent to shareholders of both Allied and Lambton in January, it was forecast that balances available to the reconstructed company would total Â£140.11--the figure s in fact Â£149,609, the net result being that the recommended dividend of 20 per cent (costing Â£91,646) is \"amply covered.\" It would have Wien possible, says Mr. Leaver, to recommend a higher dividend, but in view of current economic conditions and the Govern- ment's appeal tof restraint, the directors I ouaht it prudent to carry the surplus forward. New acaulsitions durin theyear totalled Â£517.000, of which 09.000 related to shops and offllices. Â£96,000 to industrial and Â£25,000 to residential properties (mainl rpresenting con. versloa of a leaPWnlv to a freehold) Expenditure on developments totalled over Â£200 000. the main sites being the shopping parades at Didcot and Oxford, which have become income producing this year. Sales realised Â£346,000 before costs and tax against a 1965 valuation of Â£328,000. Of the sales only Â£27.400 related to shops, plus another Â£38.000 in respect of a mixed shop/residential building. The builders' merchants business was closed, which resulted in a small loss after deducting a pro vision -previously made.

On August 1, 1966, sales in terms of value were 14 per cent. above the corresponding date of 1965. but the increase, he said, should only partially be attributed to larger actual volume as it was also influenced by copper price fluctuations., Production was maintilned at a satisfactory rate with a good trend in tyres and undry Items, and with cables stationary, The chairman confirmed a foreast that the 9om.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "History certainly has a habit of repeating itself. Just over a year ago, when Imperial Chemi- cal Industries announced its issue of Â£50m. 7% per cent issue of 150m. 74 per cent Unsecured Loan stock, 1986-91 the fixed interest market looked tolbe suffering from indigestion following the appearance of a considerable number of new debentures. But instead of put- ting the market into disorder the loan had the effect of acting as a catalyst; and the same situa- tion looks like developing this time with the new Â£60mn. ICI issue. Poedble Premium The success of this current loan seems assured, although perhaps not to the same degree as its predecessor - applications for a total of some Â£l,052m. poured in for the Â£50tn. then on offer. The point to be debated is what sort of premium the newcomer-a Â£60m. 8 per cent. Unsecured Loan stock 1988-93-is likely to com* meand when dealings start to-day week. The issue price of Â£98 per cent. gives flat and final redemp- tion yields of Â£8 3s 3d per cent. and Â£8 3s 8d per cent. respectively. When dealings started on Septem- b er 14, 1965, in the Â£50m. loan the yield differential with the 5% per cent. Funding 1987-91 was about 14s per cent. and it is interesting to note that in less than a month the ICI loan stock put oa a further 3 points to 17% for the Â£10 paid stock. Thus it would seem that the new stock could open at least 2 premium if th . same diffrential is observed; and if the BMC 8 per ceht. Unsecured Loan stock 198691, currently standing at Â£102 is considered, then up to 3 points or so premiuin may well be seen. Interest dates on the new stook, are January 10 and July 10 with' a first payment of Â£4 Os 4d per cent. due next July. Final redemp- tion is at par on July 10, 19934 As known. preferential considera- tion is being given to Ordinary, Preference and loan stockholders in ICI; and small investors, if the last allotment basis is anlthing to go by are likely to receive favour. able reatment. All applications for the Â£50m. Issue received an allotment of some sort. List open and close to-day week i and applications must be for a minimum Â£50 stock or for multiples thereof up to Â£500. Applications for more than Â£500 stock up to Â£5,000 must be in I< multiples of Â£100 and for amounts of mord than Â£5,000 in multiples of Â£500. All applications must be accompanied by a deposit of Â£10 per cent; the balance is due as to Â£40 per cent. on November 30 and Â£48 per cent. on February 28 next. The issue has been underwritten by J. Henry Schroder Wagg; brokers are Hoare and Co., Pan- mure Gordon and Co., Rowe and Pitman and J. and A. Scrlmgeour. Prospectus Page 7",

In a paper delivered at the 1960 American Mining Congress at Sall Lake City. Mr. Jeanty said the U.S Treasury held the key to the timing of such an increase. Two important factors, he said, might determine the Treasury's policy in the next two or three years-the rate of recovery of existing coinage, and the build-up of speculative pressures. Historically, he pointed out, Gaernments had not been too sue â¢saful in recovering coinage. At the same time, present estimates of specu- lative silver positions and inventory accumulations, at some 50m. ozs, were \"nothing,\" he claimed, to the amount they might reach. Such a rcseculative build-up would not nece*s sarly be in anticipation of a silver rise, but rather, in many countries, as a currency hedge. Positions, he aug aested, could easily reach several hundred million ounces, absorbing much of the present U.S. Treasury stocks. Total free world consumption Mi. leanty argued, would probably be of the order of 400m. to 450m. ozs in the next few years, and when and if the U.S. Treasury withdrew from the market he foresaw an immediate in. crease in price to $1.50 an ounce.",

He warned that aid from the industrialised nations to the under- developed world was in jeopardy of being reduced. Compared with a slight increase between 1960 and 1964, aid to the poorer nations had levelled off and delegates to the London conference had discussed means to have it increased. One very serious problem was that loans made 10 to 15 years back were now due for 1epayment, added Mr. Kibaki. \"The very sad fact is that most of the under- developed countries are now paying back to the developed countries amounts equal to half of the total aid they receive.\"",

There is no South Sea Bubble about the drilling going on in the North Sea. There is a large quantity of natural gas beneath it. Next winter, near this beach, a pipeline carrying some of this natural gas will come out of these waters. This could become the most important event in British economic history since the Industrial Revolution. It is already clear that there is more than enough natural gas under the North Sea to supply the nation*s entire gas demands at there present level. In the North Sea, Britain might have a new source of indigenous energy cheap and abundant enough to bring about a great improvement in the Balance of Payments, increase the competitiveness of our industry and revolutionize the comfort of ourdomestic life. The North Sea will also complete the gas industry's own revolution. Invaluable experience in natural gas transmission has already been gained from the successful importation of Saharan methane. And the planning of a national distribution system for the new North Sea gas age is now well under way. In appliance research and development, too, the gas industry has been busily anticipating the changes that will be required. When the natural gas beneath the North Sea starts to flow into Britain next winter, the gas industry will be ready to make the most of it and thus open a new chapter in the story of High Speed Gas. 4 ,.I * * r<., * i THE i., :: Â· In today high speed wod.. .the gas industry thinks oftomorrow 'r '' a, arl ~ Â·"

   "text_content" : "By SHEILA BLACK, Our Woman's Editor, The National Federation of Builders and Plumbers Mer- chants believes, perhaps a trifle optimistically, that, among exist- ing houses, there is a probable central heating potential for around Im. -detached homes, 31m. semi-detached and 2m. ter- raced homes, plus a possible 4m. flats and bungalows. Which pre- sumably means that about 10m. people will sooner or later have to face the perplexities of decid- ing which fuel, which system and how much. Unlike so many of their already-warmed predecessors at the onset, they are hardly short of information on the subject. In fact, there is now so much of it that a zealous inquirer after knowledge will probably find himself unable to wade through it all and will go out and buy, just as his uninformed predeces- a sors did so often, a medley, of various appliances which may well do the job inefficiently and expensively. The Heating Centre in Mor- timer Street, London, is now firmly established as the best place to get impartial advice. They will advise by post but, since it is often better to look at some of the equipment and to discuss pros and cons at length, a personal visit is undoubtedly more satisfactory. Charges for suggested schemes are low and well worth the time, trouble and money. they are likely. to save. Jn Ithe, end, however, and regard- less of what method one chooses, one is mainly in the hands of the installation engineers. Varying Estimates A lot has been said about the wide variations in cbst estimates sot the same property given by any. three or four installation experts. Much of the reasan for such variation is the fact that personal opinions vary so much on what exactly constitutes 4entral heating, and the experts differ ap much. as the amateurs. TUba, t*ebouasholduesbould do his, own homework far more thoroughly than he normally does before buying anything so as to be able to give his con- tractor a specific brief. Then he should certainly collect estimates from three or four concerns. If he is still bewildered, he can got his estimates vetted by the Heat- ing Centre for I per cent. of the value. It is often baid that the first thing to decide is what fuel one wants. In fact, this is one of the last. With competition so in- tense in recent years, there is sometimes little to choose be- tween the fuels, since higher installation costs tend to be offset by ,lower running costs and so forth. The choice of fuel is important, but only after many Courpsy: Power DuFryA BUangs A fan.idsted radiator suitable for small-bore central heating systems using heat provided by any type of modem boiler. other factors have been con- sidered. The first thing to decide is obviously what one expects of central heating, which is all too frequently a misnomer for a collection of apparatus that takes the chill off the home atmosphere. It is interesting that, about 10 years ago, manufac- turers, installers and advisers tended to think in terms of a general air temperature of around 55 degrees F. By five years ago, this was up to 60 degrees. Now we find 70 degrees the popular level. So our stan- dards ate rising, and the hardy, but often shivering. Briton .seems to be admitting a. liking for warmth and comfort What is surprising is tewide- spread theory that halls and bed- rooms should be so compara- tively unwarmed. Over and over again, leaflets gear costs and systems to a living-room tem- perature of 70 degrees and a pde Pa Ott f4,55de- grees. Surely one is normally fully dressed in the former and might want more heat in the latter? The 55-degree theory is possibly based on the benefits of fresh air and low tempera- tures for sleeping in. So what one needs for bedroom comfort is a high temperature rapidly gained and equally rapidly lost. Other Factors Other factors to consider at this stage are the family re- quirements-heat all day or for certain periods only, for ex- ample; one's own psychology about heating such as whether one actively prefers to cluster round a radiant focal point like a fireplace or whether one wants no visible source of heat and likes a room's inhabitants distri- buted more or less anywhere over its floor area; whether one might be sensitive to even the quietest hiss of air or whirr of fan; and even whether one hates the sight of radiators or grilles or anything else that transmits heat. After all one is going to have to live with one s choice. Cost Assessment Having blueprinted one's ideal system, the next thing is to de- cide how much one can afford to pay for both installation and running - not forgetting that there must also be annual main- tenance although this will prob- able average Â£5 to Â£6 at most and be. nil on some electrical methods. It should also be re- membered that permanent systems may add to the rateable value/and i( is worth finding out how much this would entail. .nUast&'Vbooe on Ta tf the running cost. \" Portable \" systems, including a lot of equipment such as heaters of all fuels not connected by pipes to boilers or built-in units, obviously do not involve re- assessment for rates. Having got thus far, it is time to think about the suitable fuel and the summoning of contrac- tors for estimates. Obviously, some homes dictate the fuel choice by lacking anywhere to store coal or oil, or having no possible place for a gas boiler. But there are a number of heating units nowadays which can be adapted to any existing hot'water supply system, what- ever its fuel supply-these are convectors which use up spare beat or which can be operated independently and electrically. They heat quickly and ev'ely, and have the advantage of not having to be installed undes windows but can live where the householder wants them placed since they force beat out by fans into all parts of the room. Or there are such methods as the gas Servowarmn in which a large, master radiator is the boiler as well as a heating unit in the room in which it is fixed. It is worth investigating such developments before committing oneself, and remembering, that a number of contractors may not have caught tip with their appearance on the heating scene and may still be thinking some- what rigidly in terms of \" either a boiler or storage heater or portable units.\" Points to Watch Incidentally while briefing the contractor, it it important to ask for. a- ougb bketch of how the system circulates and to make sure that the inside temperature will not fall unduly when the out- side temperature is below zero- although this is the time one most needs warmth, some sys- tems do not combat freezing conditions adequately. It is also worth seeing that the estimate includes any making good of damage to walls, floors and decorations, etc., after installa- tion and coming to some agree- ment on how long the system is guaranteed. Many contractors right faults free during the first six months of operation but some do not and their contracts ,ould prove expensive. It is not possible to say how much the job will cost. The majority of systems in that non- ixistent dwelling, the \" average \" house, are between Â£300 and Â£500, according to the degree of sophistication of programming, time-clocks, thermostats, and some advisable insulation to keep all that expensive warmth inside the house. Clearly one can do it at a third of the price or double the price, but one is unlikely to get continuous warmth at low cost in the majority of. homes. Heating is one thing for which credit is still generally available. Building societies with \" home improvement \" schemes are still able to extend mortgages in some cases and are, in fact, glad to do so since their funds no longer run to loans for new customers. Loan Schemes Most gas and electricity Boards operate loan schemes at nominal interest rates of 6* to 7 per cent. or so over five years., Oil company schemes vary from around 71 to 7*, although this can be lowered if one pays a third of the cost at time of installation. Shell-Mex and BP encourage summer installation by not collecting the first pay- ment until October as long as I one's equipment is put in after i April 1, which is tantamount to six months free borrowing. Most schemes carry life assur- ance, and some unemployment i assurance, although these are dependent on keeping up the payments. With solid fuel, loans can be granted for more than the usual five years at 61 per cent Until about a year ago, cen- tral heating added more to the value of a house than its basic cost. Nowadays, that iq not the case but agents do report that it is becoming ihncreasingly hard to sell an unheated home. And, as more modern shops and offices inure their inhabitants to winter warmth, it will become an essential rather than a luxury at bhoe.n"

   "text_content" : "By J. S. McGREGOR DIRECTOR, HONEYWELL U.K. TEMPERATURE CONTROLS DIVISION A charge sometimes levelled against home-heating controls is that their design is over-sophisti- cated. The answer to this is that 'sophistication is always justified if it results in the close control necessary to achieve operational economy. But the criterion for house- holder use must be simplicity- that is the means of exercising control must be uncomplicated -and this implies a completely automatic system which requires only one original decision by the home owner. Outward \"sophistication\" in the shape of a proliferation of panel switches only confuses. Time switches have been used for some years in heating systems to cut heating off during the night, in order to save fuel. In more recent times the \" pro- grammer \" has been introduced, which is really no more than a sophisticated time switch, and moreover, an unnecessarily over- complicated one. Cutting Costs Consisting of a clock and one or more manual selector switches, it enables the home owner to switch the heating system off at different times of the day, too, in an effort to save even more fuel. Unfortunately, this simple logic does not always work out in practice, and at best such fuel saving'is made at the expense of convenience and comfort. Though time regulation is very important, temperature control is even more vital in an economic heating system, since it is only through continuous HOT WATER CYLINDER nnMEOT[P! UVnDAMIPR UIC&TIMPR IU _ __ ~___ __ and close temperature control, according to varying weather conditions, that a system operates efficiently to provide ideal comfort conditions at minimum possible cost. Such a system could be termed sophisticated in design yet be simplicity itself to operate. Cer- tainly complete automation is essential for an effective control system. One small-bore control system currently on the market demonstrates the value of several component parts all working together to provide optimum control of an installa- tion. Three Controllers The system consists of three temperature controllers: a boiler controller which varies the tem- perature of the water in the boiler and system according to outside weather conditions, that is water temperature high when the outside temperature is low, and reducing gradually as the weather becomes milder, a \" cylinder thermostat\" looks after the domestic hot water re- quirements and, most important, a low-voltage room thermostat. Once set, the first two com- ponents need never again be touched. The home owner has only to select the room tempera- ture desired to obtain the close control needed to ensure maxi- mum fuel saving at minimum running cost. Economy is achieved because the burner is only switched on when there is a need for heat, either for the room or for the domestic hot water. In mild weather . when the water temperature selected by the room thermostat-is too low to keep domestic hot water hot enough, the strap-on thermostat takes over until demand is satisfied.- Once the variable flow temperature has been achieved the low-voltage room thermostat maintains room temperature to within extremely fine limits-a further economy since over- swings and under-swings or space temperature are thereby eliminated. Domestic hot water is auto- matically assured at all times, and further, because 'the boiler is only fired when there is a call for central heating or hot water, there is no need to use another more expensive fuel to obtain hot water during the summer. The room thermostats in this system also provide for \"night set-back.\" This allows for a lower temperature to be main- tained at night, or when the householder is out. It has been found to be more economic to operate the heating system for short periods during the night rather than shut down altogether and allow the house to grow cold. At the end of the period the thermostat automatically raises temperature again to the required level. Fuel Economies Fuel economies deriving from automatic controls can cover the costs of the controls themselves within one to three winter :esons. Some critics are suspicious of the true efficiency of control systems in achieving these. But the .facts controvert this. All central heating systems are designed to maintain a required temperature at a projected out- side temperature (usually the lowest contemplated). If out- side temperature rises the full output of the boiler is not really required, overheating ensues and fuel is wasted. The house- holder's comfort is then im- paired as well as his pocket raided. \"Comfort Band\" Further, every individual has a \" comfort band\" of about six degrees, which means that so long as the room temperature remains within this band he feels neither hot nor cold. A central heating system could be running towards the top of this band, wasting the fuel provid- ing the extra six degrees in heat, while adding nothing to the householder's comfort. An efficient control system both keeps temperature swing to a minimum and keeps this swing right down to the lowest level of the comfort band. The significance of this can be seen from the fact. that one degree Fahrenheit of overheating can lead to. up to an extra 5 per cent. cost on the fuel bill. Maximum Comfort Any further \"economies\" resulting from switching the system off regularly at the expense of the consumer's com- fort are obviously false ones. Not only does such action destroy the very comfort condi- tions which the installation was designed to provide, it also results in the, system working that much harder (using more fuel) to re-establish required temperature levels. The formula must always be maximum com- fort at minimum cost and a control system stands or falls by its ability to achieve this formula. Despite the public attention focused on central heating over the last two years, it remains a fact that only 7 per cent. of Britain's population currently enjoy its luxury. Greater public ppreciation of the value of automation controls could trans- form this dismal figure and give the central heating industry a valuable boost by attracting in many more of the vast untapped market of \" ultra-cost-con- scious \" medium-income groups.",

Packaged Systems Solid fuel is progressing even further into the field of heating by warm air, not only with boilers and the traditional heat exchangers, but alio with pao. kaged systems which sensibly reduce the colt of installation. One of the first in this field was the Stokermatio warm-air fur' nace, but there are now several from which to choose. The Biddle Colomair is making a mark with local authoritles and estate developers; this uses a well-known Torglow room heater, the hot water from which serves a builtin heat exchanger, twin fani blowing warm air to other rooms, The unit also houses the domestio hot water cylinder and the first part of the Insulated chimney.

The free ddsign service which the Coal Utilisatiop Council has established for estate developers, including local authorities, is being utilled enthusiastically by them.

But of course by far the greater number are for room heaters or open fires heating several radia- tors to Parker Morris standard or better, and drawings showing pipe runs and sizes, radiator positions and sizes, pump specilft cation, etc are accompanied by a full speoflcation enabling the Installer to go ahead, This ser- vice is obtainable throuih the regional ofosfce of the CUC.

An interesting indication of the success of gas central heating appears in the voluminous report published this tnonth by the Consumers' Association. To help in preparing the report, the consumers Association obtained views and comments from 1,820 of its members. Of these, 914 or more than half had installed gas systems (the runner-up was solid fuel which had been chosen by 523 households, while electricity was in 46). The gas industry believes that the gas central heating boom is still in its infancy, not just because it is in fact only a few years old, but because the bene- fits of natural gas from the North Sea have yet to be realised. In its bid to quintuple total sales of gas over the next ten years, the industry is look- ing to the domestic central heat- ing load to provide a very large part . of the expansion. The industry is encouraged by what is already happening in the Lon- don area, where as many as half of all the new houses and flats due to be built over the next couple of years are scheduled to have gas central heating. Nationwide Habit? There is no reason why the central heating \"habit,\" which is much more firmly rooted in the South than the North, despite climate. considerations, should not become nationwide. The rate at which the market develops will depend very much on reducing- munng costs and, when in a fe, years' time North Sea gas is well and truly in business, the industry is confident of achieving substan- tial cuts in gas prices. Considering the great potential of the central heating market, the gas industry, uneasy for some time that the term \" central heat- ing\" cannot be defined, is anxious that it should mean what most people meant by it, in the past, that is, whole-house warm- ing-and that consumers should set their sights high enough to put in installations which provide more than background or partial warmth. It is indeed in the provision of full or \"genuine\" (as the industry likes to think of it) central heating that gas has established its ascendancy in recent years. The independent large-scale home audit carried out by AGB Research Limited showed that during the last quarter of 1965 (the busiest quarter of the year) gas obtained 43 per cent. of all central heat- ing sales in small-to-medium size installations and 61 per cent. in* the medium-to-large range above 38,000 Btu. It was only in small installations up to 28,000 Btu. giving mainly partial or back- ground systems, that gas was surpassed by its competitors. New Development But the gas industry is not leaving its rivals unchallenged in the market for partial systems. The most important gas appli- ance development during the past year has been the appear- ance of gas-fired back boiler units. These work in conjunc- tion with a gas fire to provide radiant andilor convected heat to the room which houses the fire, plus a constant supply of domestic hot water. This deve- lopment is particularly impor- tant in both the \" home improve- ment \" and \" clean air \" markets, because it can replace an exist- ing but outdated back boiler installation or be built nto the cnhmney' breast, providigt the amenities of a central heating and hot water system economic- ally and conveniently. Sophistication of controls for gas hot-water and warm-air central heating systems has con- tinued and reinforces one of the first principal advantages of gas as a central heating medium -its immediate responsiveness to changes due to weather con- ditions and in family routine, \"Automation\" is a term per- haps too widely used nowaday but the modem gas central heat- ing boiler or warm-air unit almost does think for itself; it can certainly be adjusted to observe a most elaborate per- mutation of operational require. mnents. Commercial Field One of the commercial de- velopments which has . un- doubtedly helped to increase the market for gas central heating from an annual level of about 13,000 units to 200,000 in some- thing like five years has been \"package deals.\" These are complete central heating instal- lations offered at all-inclusive prices. One manufacturer offers a whole range of \"packaged deals \" of this kind to suit any size of house from two bed- 1~ The Crane Cavendish sold fuel central boiler. Three models are available and they born a wlde variety of nmokele fluela. rooms upwards, while another, .. selling \"direct\" to the public, concentrates on smaller houses and flats, and has built up a very thriving turnover in a short time. It remains to be seen what effect recent economic restric- tions will have on the market for central heating. With an in- creasing proportion of gas systems going into new housingli. the gas industry stands to lose more than its competitors from cuts in the building programme. More generally, the course of central heating sales over the next 12 months of \"freeze\" and deflation will demonstrate to what extent central heating has succeeded in establishing itself less as a luxury and more as a way of life.",

   "article_dc_title" : "The Lessons Learned in Oil",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By DAVID E. PITHER DIRECTOR, THE HEATING CENTRE Two, example of oflfrde udai. Left, the Portway VWkmr and, right, the Wileo. ML. IV Wllame boller. It is fair to say that the major oil companies really originated the big surge forward in domestic heating. Although their endeavours were prompted by an urgent need to find a large outlet for the inevitable consequences of the rapidly in- creasing demand for motor fuel, everyone in the industry should give credit where it is due. Any product or service can be sold if sufficient money is spent on promoting it, but whether or not it continues to sell depends on other factors. Undoubtedly mistakes were made in the early days of pro- moting oil-fired central heating for the domestic market. Much of the equipment used was untried, and many so-called approved installers had only a very sketchy knowledge of basic principles, and virtually no experience of oil firing. Many people are interested in the possibilities of installing oil- fired central heating in their homes, and now the hard lessons have been learned. The shoddy and inefficient appliances have disappeared, the untrained and ignorant installers have been sifted out, and the scene is set for the re-entry of oil as a serious contender for a fair share of this huge market. Biggest Factor Probably the Wallflame boiler was the biggest single factor in establishing the fuel for domestic heating. These boilers are com- pletely automatic, reliable, reasonably quiet, easily main- tained and suitable for instal- lation in the kitchen, and at the same time the pressure jet burners have been steadily im- proved to achieve a lower noise level and greater reliability. From the beginning the pot burner has maintained a reputa- tion for straightforward, reliable performance, although lacking the sophistication of the auto- matic \" on-off \" appliances. Since many people are more concerned with running costs than capital outlay, and there is a general trend away from any operation which is even vaguely reminiscent of manual labour, there has been a growing interest in all heating systems fired by oil. Two Queries It has been most interesting to watch this growth over the past three or four years. Most members of the public have an idea that oil is generally cheaper to run than gas, which is the most popular choice of fuel for automatic domestic central heat- ing systems to-day. However, people are often surprised to find that there is quite an appreciable difference in many cases, even where gas is available on the two-part tariff at Is 4d per therm, plus standing charge. In any discussion regarding oil-fired heating, somebody is bound to raise the two queries- \" smell\" and \" noise.\" No doubt oil companies, service engineers and installers must accept some responsibility for the smell complaint. How often are feed lines and joints to burners, fire stem valves, filters, etc., completely oil tight? Fitters seem to forget that a water-tight joint is not neces sarily oil-tight. Of course, oil boilers with inadequate flues will smell just as unpleasantly as a boiler operating with any other fuel in the same unfavourable conditions. Training Fitters Insufficient attention is paid to the training of fitters in the basic principles of making an oil-tight joint in an oil line. All joints and connections must be tightened up, undone and remade with one of the proprietary pastes for making 100 per cent. oil-tight joints. Installers seem to think that all is well providing there is not a pool of oil below a joint. They forget that slight seepage covered with dust and fluff provides a type of \"Air-wick\" in reverse. The other main complaint is ndise. This is really not necessary nowadays. Although some of the earlier pressure jets were slightly reminiscent of their aeronautical 'namesakes, many pot burners and Wallfames are really quiet. Apart from these types, there have been great improvements with pressure jet burners, and the majority of these are certainly not unduly noisy. Once the suspicions have been allayed about smell and noise, the inquirer will often raise the question of maintenance costs. Admittedly an oil-fired boiler probably requires more routine maintenance than a comparable appliance using another fuel, but people do not seem to appreciate that several of the major oil companies and sup- pliers offer very comprehensive schemes at fixed prices. In some cases insurance against the cost of new parts can 'be included. Storage Tanks However, the public should be aware of the fact that the annual costs of maintaining an oil-fired boiler are unlikely to exceed the quarterly standing charges for gas. Another popular misconcep- tion in the public's mind is the size of an oil storage tank. Generally it is advisable to instal a 600-gallon tank, since this enables the user to purchase fuel at the 500-gallon price, apart from providing a really adequate reserve. But very few people realise that a 600-gallon tank measures 6 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet-probably not larger than a coal bunker. The final theory put forward against oil is the danger of sup- plies being restricted by an inter- national situation. In 1966, with trips to the moon just round the corner, presumably anything is possible, but'the whole economy of this country is dependent on oil in various forms, and supplies are no longer only obtained from one source. There are probably very few homes in Britain that have not employed portable oil heaters for domestic heating at one time or another. Certain of these appliances attracted unfavour- able publicity a few years ago, ana me manuXacIurrcrs 1 iUna type of beater have to contend with this position. Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to know exactly how many small oil heaters are still a standby for cold weather. New Convectors The new oil-flued convectors, which are now appearing on tha ,s home market, may well achieve \\ very large sales, once they have overcome the natural prejudice against the unknown. The fact that these appliances sell in hun. dreds of thousands per annum on the Continent would augur well for their future in this country. For the bigger and more sophisticated household installa- tion, there is no doubt that the new Gyro Pak Burner will be successfully employed for the smaller installations up to 60,000- 70,000 Btu/hr, with Wallflames, extending this range up over the H 100,000 Btu mark, and with pressure jets taking over for the- really large installations.",

   "text_content" : "By R. H. PHILLIPS DIRECTOR, EDA DIVISION, THE ELECTRICITY COUNCIL Electric central heating is now clearly establishing itself as the cleanest, most convenient and economical system of domestic heating available. This applies whether the home exists or is yet to be built, is a bungalow, flat, terraced, semi-detached or fully detached house.' Different advantages appeal particularly to the local authority, the private developer, the architect, the builder or to the tenant. In 1965, according to independent statistics, one in three of all automatic central heating systems put into existing houses was elec- tric, a considerably larger pro. portion than any of the three fuel systems. Since the Electricity Council, for the first time, was able to mount a really concentrated campaign In April this year, sales throughout the country have nearly doubled. Storage radiator sales, for instance, are running at over 350,000 a year, floor warming installations have doubled in the last four years and nearly 30 local authorities have recently blaced substantial orders for Blectricaire units. The public and the building trade have become aware of the manifold advantages of these methods of heating. Cost Breakdown The Eleotricalre system uses ducted warm air from a central heat storage unit providing con- tinuous comfort warmth to keep the' chill off and reduce con. densation. A few minutes after the operation of a thermostat, time switch or hand switch the house is heated up to full tem. perature which can be preset on the thermostat to 70 F. or more. An Installation costs about Â£125 and In an average house will cost about 14s a week to run all the year round. Storage fan heaters also per. form In the same way as Elec- tricaire but are usually Indivi. dual units for one room, or, with stub ducts, can also pro. vide heat for one or two adjoin. ing rooms. They cost from Â£40 each, plus Â£7-410 for Installa. tion and can be used when pro. else control of temperature is required. Used selectively, they can have very low running costs. Ploorwarming built into the floor during construction must comply with a few simple de. sign standards such as adeq ute depth of screed, sucent thermal insulation and the heat. Ing elements correctly embedded, Once Installed the heating system is invisible and offers complete freedom for the layout of furni. ture. The Installation cost is about 3s Od a square foot and will cost to run about Is a year Ior ach square foot of floor heated. A i (w Two Kenton \"Lowrtor\" 2 kW water-flled storage hoaters. They are safe to sit on and may be used as window mnats. Storage radlators provide the xistina home with all the beno- fits o electrie central heating without any damage to fabric or decorations during Inatalla- tion, just a simple wiring Job. Bven two haters, which can be Installed for 55 gns. to start a system, make a tremendovs dif- ference to the comfort of the average home. Each radiator costs between Â£6 and Â£16 a year to run depending on use and size, For a three-bodroomed hous Ir system of four radiators oosting about 105.110 gns. would give overall warmth and running costs would be between Â£40 and Â£50 a year, Whatever type or size of home is under consideration, one of these systems will pro- vlde a satisfactory, economical solution. Blectrio central heat' Ing has so many Inherent advan. tarsr. It is flmeless, clean, roe- qridng no chimneys, flue aNh liposl or full storage and It IN worth seting out the particular pointn wloh munt appeal to thos mostly concerned with the provislon.po housing. The Attractions The *ttractlons for the local authort are low capital and run0 srei the prolonging of IhW iTOi d1oratilonsn prserv. ng the f a by reduction of ondeniuCAonI reducing cost of construetto because chimneys and flues are not required and the system requires little main. tennpr developer loo The private developer looks for low capital cost and lower cont of construction plus cornm plete freedom to design houxes in a more attractive way with- out extra coat and from only one nervice connection. The architect has freedom to desiun hiN building exactly as he wants it to look and an he wants to offer It for the convenience of the inhabitant without having to allow spaco for boilers, flues, chimneyn, pipes, fuel storage or access for fuel delivery, Builder's Job The builder's Job is more straightforward - no chimneys or flues to construct. The owner will have a clean, flameless, un- obtrumlve heating Installation giving complete comfort and, moreover, running on half-price electricity. Not only will capital and running costs be low but the fabric of the property will be preserved and the life of decorations prolonged. Electric central heating sets a new standard In convenient, automatic low cost living, It has become a status symbol In the U.S. Britain usually follows a similar pattern. The tenant has many of the owner's advantages, particularly In the preservatlon of decora. tions and low running cost. In addition If he wishes on leavipng he could take his storage radia. tors with himi thus a tenant need have no fear that he lI haarding his expenditure to the benefit of his landlord. The nation has a massive 4 capital investment in the else. tricity supply system which has a large unused capacity during the night and at some time dur- ing the day. This capacity can be used for electric centrRl heat4i1 Ing and this accounts for t being offered at half price, just as public transport ofers cheap fares between rush hours. Electricity to the consumer is 100 per cent. officient, all the dirt, fumes, small and smoke having been removed at the power station, In the home, therefore, a large amount of heat ia not wasted up the flue or chimney. It is very important, therefore, that proper attention is given to thermal Insulation which, In terms of existing houses, means Insulation between the ceiling and the rooft' and draught exclusion. This is quite Inexpensive. Incorporated during the doelgn stage, thermal insulation can be provided at little or no extra cost, When provided to a U value of .13 overall, unrestricted electrio central heating, using colling heating, convector or radiant heaters can be just as low in cost and offers a good diversity to the supply system, It is necessary to match theA4 wide diversity of building systems and methods with I heating service of equal flexi. bility and reliability, Electricity not only provides these but also offers a choice of heating systems which can be used aseparately or In combination to meet the requirements of all types of hullding develop mnt.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Economlcs Editor A waring that the public sector will not be able to exp-nd at the rate t bas been doing is given by the leading Oxford econoamst Profemsor Sir John Hicks, In a stdy publish-d to-day by the Institute of Economic Alabi. Sir Johnt is severely critical of Odvernment o6licy for \" throw- ing the weight of the required coitraction upon investment in pri vate industry.\" He maintains that \" there can be no recovwry from a recession engineered in this manner, except by a renewal of the balance of pay- ments crisis. This is a game which cannot be played again, and played in public, after all that has happened.\" The study suggests that' local government is the main culprit in the rapid rise in public expenditure. The nationalisition of local govern- ment might be ecdhomically tempt- ing, but would nevertheless be a disaster. \" Our constitution-less democracy is evolving with alarming speed towards a presidential system in which a party leader, controlling his party by patronage, renews his power by periodic plebiscites on Issues chosen by himself,\" he declares. \"There is not much which stands between us and that denouement, apart from the trade unions and the local authorities. With the local authorities gone, the way would be clear, for a despotism tempered by strikes.\" Devaluation Sir John would prefer instead to transfer secondary education to the Exchequer and. more immediately, to work out ways by which \"varia- tions, in total government expenditure can ac. more effectively as a regulator of the economy.\" The author' is against a unilateral devaluation, because it could have grave and \"even sinister\" repercus- sions without international support. An internationally agreed and sup- ported devaluation would be \" attrac- tve \" but \" tihat support has nt been forthicotl.in\" Neverteess h is hir fipm certin that the temporaty freeis will be sufifcient to restore the country's complete position, and believes that the possibility of a cut in all money waes and prices should be con- sidered.

   "text_content" : "By Our Scientific Correspondent For the first time since Britain started to develop nuclear power commercially 12 years ago, a British company is to market a really small and compact nuclear plant able to supply process steam for a manufactring plant or power for a remote area. Fairey Engineering is understood to have developed a range of. designs with power outputs between 20,000 kilowatts and 80,000 This corresponds to a yield of process steam between 100 and 300 tons an hour. The new concept differs con- siderably from the design of com- parable US. units. Like them, it is based on pdre ordinary water under very high pressure to remove the beat from the nuclear fuel and take it to a boiler. But in the U.K. design, all major components are inside a thick concrete pressure vessel. In U.S. pressurised water reactors, the heat exchangers are outside the pressure vessel which is made of very thick steel. While no prices have been indi- cated so far, it is understdood that the designs will be competithre and they' are so ' flexible that there should be a big tange of applica- tions open to t1 m, frm supply- ing electricity i remote areas to running water desaltinglat. Part of the work doie by the Atomic Energy Authority on the very compact reactors needed in huclear propulsion has borne fruit in the new design. . It achieves a compact form by us- ing powerful fuel containing a large amount of the nuclear explosive uranium-235. This would be capable of full power operation for up to three years without replacement.",

Two persl experiences may seem to emphasise the value of appealing to potential customers in their own languages. A year or so ago, a Scandi- navian producer of films for industry lunched with me and we talked shop. I asked him what kind of competition his European sponsors experienced from British films on similar subjects. \"Very little,\" was the surprising reply, \"You see you English still think that everyone should understand your difficult language, so your commentaries are always in English. Our clients would never dream of showing a customer a sales film in any language but his own I\" Some time ago, one of my clients, expecting a delegation of half a dozen men from South America (all known to understand English well), asked me urgently to add a South American Spanish commentary to a film he wished to show the delegation. He also invited me to be present at the screening as he thought I should be in- terested. I was. Arriving at his office, I was introduced to the delegation, who did indeed speak excellent English, and in his little theatre, the flm began.

So unless we flood this country with more and more cars-say four or five per household?-(with incident- ally the old ones which are fit for scrapping left to rot on our sidewalks) overseas earnings of the motor industry will dwindle.

If the overseas buyer will only pay a certain price then British manufacturers without a large home market but wishing to continue sales abroad will have to cut costs and union and non- union employeesm through all levels, will have to co-operate or face large scale unemployment It is nonsensical to throw away an export market, because home demand falls.

Some months ago I put for- ward a scheme, to British Rail, suggesting, the. development of a mobilei exhibition servide for the benfit of British exporters. This was intended to cover Europe, rather than just one or two countries and in essence, simply meant a way ps transt porting small exhibits to areas where absiness coudid. ,Io eX ouAt a centrail exhibitiost centre is a very desirable feature, but ,n the main it would seem to be of more use to the larger companies, than to the small ones, where the encouragement is so vital. My view is, that if exporters had the facility of being able to take their products right to the customer on the spot, carry out a series of local demonstra- tions and move on \"whistle stop \" fashion, then a great deal of otherwise unlikely business could be scooped up. I do not pretend that this is entirely novel, but anykpnewedge, little ; aba b at,4 Stint6te OR these fines except by somre f the larger companies and usually by road.

The Sykes international poultry breeding organisation was one of 31 British com- panies which took stand space m Kiev. In fact, the co-opera- tion between all these com- panies and the Botrd of Trade resulted in numerically the largest single national exhibit other than that in the Russian pavilion. Quite apart from the benefit to British exhibitors of the BoT assistance in staging the event, an outstanding achievement was the uniformity of design of the stands, the variation being within the confines of each ex- hibitor's display space. Add to this a team of resident carpen- ters and electricians, plus BoT export advisory staff and the assistance of British Embassy officials and it is apparent that here was an export operation with a difference. Exactly how much business will follow the Kiev operation will depend to a great degree on the efficiency of the participat- ine U.K. companies in their \"follow-up\" operations.

One of the most moving moments in recorded opera is Hilde Konetzni's spoken \" Florestan,\" just I before the Act 2 duet of Fidelio: the single word is charged with love I and tenderness; the anxiety and t terrors borne are resolved at last 1 in -the radiant pronunciation of 4 her husband's name. This occurred 1 on a Vox recording of the opera, I made from a Vienna State Opera 4 broadcast of 1945, and never very 4 decisively available in this country. It is missing on the disc of \" high- lights\" from that set now issued i on Vox SOPL 5370/OPL 370. The disc is badly presented. Seefried, Schiffler and Bbhm are \"featured\" with photographs on the sleeve, and there is no word about Konetzni and Torsten Ralf, who are the main interest of the set now. Nor is the chance taken to point out that this is a perform- ance of Fidelio in the theatre for which Beethoven wrote it. Nor, until we pull the disc from its sleeve, can we discover what it contains. The items are the overture, Marzelline's aria, the quartet, Rocco's, Pizzaro's and Leonore's arias, the prisoners' chorus, and Florestan's aria. As a one-disc representation of Fidello it hardly compares-even at its bargain price (25s 2d)-with those drawn from the DGG or Columbia sets. The recording, which has been \" electronically remastered for stereo,\" is poor, and distorts badly in Florestan's aria. It is best con- sidered as a souvenir issue, a re- minder of those post-war Theater an der Wien performances before the State Opera was rebuilt. New listeners to Konetzni will discover that she had a beautiful tone, and big legato phrasing; that her style was broad, and her inter- pretation warm and human. Also, that some of the notes are pain- fully out of tune I SchOffsr lacks the weight for Pizarro's aria, and substitutes vehemence for power. The finest thing is Ralf's strong, noble projection of Florestan's monologue. For some 20' years, 1778*97, William Shield was house-composer to Covent Garden, and then associated with them for another ten. To-day he is remembered, if at all, as the composer of The Ploughboy, which Benjamin Britten has arranged, and of \"Light as thistledown moving\" from Rosina, which Joan Satebr. land has recorded. Now: on record the whole of the Garden ballad-opera Rosina(v17i2 and a pretty piece it is (Dceca SXL/LXT 6254). The tale, in so far as there is one, bv Mrs. Frances Brooke is that of Ruth. reset in English 18th-century fields, with a rustic couple, Phoebe and William, to quarrel and make it up and provide light contrast to the more delicate courtship of Rosina, a gleaner, by the wealthy Mr. Belville. The score is \"com- posed and selected\" by Shield. Hogarth in his Memoirs of the Opera described it well: \"Shield's music is not marked by force or energy, but it is per- fectly suited to the subjects of his pieces, which are sweet and simple pictures of rural life. His melodies, in style, character, and adaptation to the accents of our native speech, are perfectly English; though, in their smoothness, grace and refine. ment, they bear marks of the com- poser's intimate acquaintance with the Italian school. The air in Rosina.' Whilst with village maids I stray', is a brilliant and difficult bravura: . . . and yet these airs are so natural and expressive, that they ' do not appear out of place even in the mouths of the village girls who sing them.\" The performance is directed by Richard Bonynge-without Suther- land. Margreta Elkins is the heroine: a little too buxom in tone, I should have thought, for the artless heroine, though no doubt a contrast was intended with the still more artless Phoebe of Elizabeth Harwood. Monica Sin- clair dons William's breeches and enjoys lunging, not always tidily, into her stentorian chestnotes. Kenneth MacDonald doubles as a debonair captain and a * Rustic whose accents range from Ooirish to cockney. Robert Tear is a gentle Mr. Belville, but his words are not clear. Nor are Miss Elkin's. In fact, despite what Hogarth wrote. I find the contrast between the simple melodies and the singers' artful approach somewhat dis- concerting. Some of the innocent freshness of the work is lost. Presumably Bonynge has composed the adornments and cadenzas. When Haydn visited Covent Garden to see Shield's The Wood- man, in 1791, he complained that the theatre was dark and dirty.' and the gallery vociferous and \" impertinent,\" and added (his own capitals): \"THE ORCHESTRA IS SLEEPY.\" Under Bonynge the LSO is as lively as can be; the charming overture (with Valda Aveling's merry continuo too prominent for purists, but delightful) goes parti- r cularly well. The engineering of y the disc is not always too careful: dialogues ping-pong between the speakers, and there is a drop in :r volume between MacDonald's e hunting-song and the duet which follows. But on the whole this is 1 a successful and attractive excur- il sion down one of opera's by-ways: it captivating to start with, a little r- too bland to sustain interest all D, the time, but constantly agreeable. a- A libretto is provided.

[The new production Ope Strauss's Die Frau o lne Schatten, also origi- nally scheduled for the first week, had already been moved back to October 2 due to mechanical diffi- culties.] world premiere The new Metropolitan and its opening night audience remind one of a suddenly moneyed technocrat whose many abilities and accom-designed plishrents, unexpectedly in de- mand, lack much in the way of true grace and dignity, and whose andreside ntacks a bit of despera- tion and over exertion. Mrs. John- son observed that the chandeliers \"just looked like stars\" and that about sums up the prevailing level of perception and articulation. As a working plant for the pro- duction of opera, the place holds every promise of success. Though hinges were still rusty on oneral Maning night, the mechanical capabilities of the stage and lighting system are sobviously formidable. drom the two locations I have occupied, in different areas of the orchestra sthils, the acoustics are better than from closing, parable points ew the old Met and reporti'ss from other areas of the house indicate that this is consistently the case. Seating Is comfortable, sightlines thexcellent, circulation and audience accommodation apparently good, I though this night was no fair test Sos that. Decoratively, the house Is - objectionable in certain details, but [not I fnewl, n overall design and t appDiearance. One only wishes that a the faint tone of Hotel Aowderne hacould be beeliminated. The new onera itself is lust not The new aoara itself Il iust not The new Metropolitan Opera a House at. Lincoln Center was a christened on Friday evening with r the world premiere of Samuel r Barber's Antony and Cleopatra, in a an elaborate production designed t and directed by Franco Zeffrelli, s who also constructed the libretto t from Shakespeare's play. s The capacity audience, which in- c cluded Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson a and President Markos of the' Philippines, and his wife, Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller of New York, and many others of political, social and even artistic significance (that is, Mme. Lotte Lehmann) also heard Rudolf Bing, the Metropolitan's General Mana- ger, announce that the orchestral musicians' strike - which had threatened the continuance of the season-had been settled during the course of the evening. We are thus spared a simultaneous opening and closing, and the new produc- tions of Ponchielli's La Gioconda and Verdi's La Traviata will have their premieres on Thursday and could be eliminated. Itonet~ol -ii~~cl Yoderne The new awrÂ· Itrelf Ir iurt not a success. Zeffirelli's libretto is nowhere near bold enough; it preserves all sorts of useless ex- position and irrelevant characters, and thus fails to concentrate on the essential matter of the relation- ships among the characters. Regret- tably, this production makes the same mistake. Costume and set effects are there for their own sakes, rather than to express a meaning, except in the most crudely symbolic way. A last- minute seizure of good taste and sense led Zeffirelli to do away with the garish turquoise asps that festooned poor Leontyne Price in the last scene of the dress rehearsal. [Is it Cleopatra or the Medusa ?1 But there was plenty left to contribute to the ponderous cinemascope fashion parade he has made out of Antony. Shades of Meyerbeer, but shades only. If Meyerbeer had only written the scorel There at least was a man with a secure knowledge of theatri- cal effect, an admirable command of vocal writing, a frequent bold- ness of colour and thrust, a not infrequent melodic and com- positional originality. The best that can be said of Mr. Barber's Antony is that it is not the worst opera to come down the pike in recent years, and that it contains moments of genteel elo- quence, notably in the two death scenes. But the bulk of it is impersonal, pale, and the incidental music for the leading figures is as passionless as one can imagine, particularly when one considers the subject. A more detailed analysis will follow in a few days' time, when there will also be occasion to specify with respect to the work of the singers, headed by Miss Price, Rosalind Elias, Justino Diaz, Jess Thomas, and Ezio Flagello, whose work in general added up to a quantity of good sound, but only the dimmest glimmer of who's who and what's what.",

   "text_content" : "By B. A. YOUNG Only the other day I was saying how youth had a special quality that excused its faults; but there is one fault to which current youth isn't excessively given that can't be excused, and that is its howling self-pity. Three out of the four characters in Stuart Gilman's play, which the Mermaid gave a one- night stand last night, are hopeless neurotics and failed suicides; and all they do is to tell one another about their miseries and the unfair- ness of the world. Chief neurotic is Steve, who is 24 but claims not to be an adult, and who likes to be addressed as God, and to behave rather as he imagines God might if he lived In a bedsitter. Steve shares his bed- sitter with Louise, who has had a troublesome abortion, married the child's father and then left him for Steve. Their constant visitors are Brahm who one would say was normal if he were not totally under the thumb of an obvious nut like Steve; and Steve's 19-year-old brother Mike who appears to be normal, though dull, until he has a nervous breakdown in the second act and turns into a zombie. Their relationships never develop, and their problems are not resolved; the play ends, that is to say the author stops work on it, with Louise sitting on a chair down centre and telling the audience how miserable they all are. Mr. Gilman is 25, and therefore too old to be excused for this kind of dramatic self-abuse. What does he think he has told us when his piece is done? Does he believe that this is a valid commentary on 20th- century civilisation? If so, I'm totally unable to go along with him. These selfish and boring young people appear . to have nothing serious to complain about; they don't even possess the magic touch of Jimmy Porter, who could trans- mute his aggressions into lambent flames of poetry; when they sound off, as they tend to do from time to time, it is only into rbodomontade. Mr. Gilman should be warned that too often the 20th-century addiction to realism is the delight of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. As Steve, Clive Francis gives a thoroughly well-observed and well. controlled performance, and Coral Atkins was sometimes able to sound the one note the author has given her with genuine pathos. Edward Langdop, as Brahm, and Stephen von Schreibr, as Mike, never had much of a chance. The director is Joseph Israeli.",

Last g Friday was not the best of times I to -run into him and the inivitable v discussion of the recent behaviour r of the South African Gold share i market seemed, if anything, to add a touch of sourness to his glass of bitter which already had a sus- picion of cloudiness. \" Look at what's happened to i them during this Account, he con- I inuqd.

Well, there Ices no behaviour that our Gold Mines oldx share new low for the year on Thursday, but it was followed by a rally when oow-time buyers moved in. Fallen Too Far? Warming to my theme, I sug- gested that it was often right to buy Kaffirs when the market was look. ing in a despairing mood. After all, the industry itself was not in bad shape even if hedge-buying against U.K. economic problems had eased for the time being. And yields were looking attractive again; over 9 per cent. wha before DTR on Doon- fontein and St. Helena, for ex- ample,red wit a good 8 per cent. on Westiotern Holdings. In the more speculative class, shares of newer M ines such as Kloof and Zandpan were not so far below the year's best levels and it seemed that Western Areas at lews 72d against a 1966 high of nearly 24s might be worth looking at again. Especially as the shares are now traded in New York and the Cape is already talking of a rise of 1 dwt in grade being disclosed in the up and cobeing yoAng gold producer'nt September quarterl report. Taking a view over the next six months or so, I suggested, would he buy or sell Gospeculas nowtive Just a little grudgingly he admitted that there was a case for buying at there was a case for buying at these levels, although he would be happier if the political outlook were clearer. But then it is never plain sailing when prices are rela- tively low and, at least, he was wearing a thoughtful and less morose look when I left him with a fresh clear glass of bitter. Western Mining The broker may have been fur- ther cheered if, at the time, I had with me a copy of the review of Western Mining just prepared by Melbourne brokers, A. C. Goode. There is a great deal of U.K. interest in this company which, safely away from political and home economic worries, has intrigu- ing prospects in Australia's excit- ing mineral expansion. At present, Western Mining is largely dependent on its gold interests which account for some 30 per cent of Australian output and which, of course, would gait 'substantially from any rise in the metal price. Future growth liec in, the young aluminium, iron on and nickel developments, to whict may be added copper if the pro posed prospecting in the Warburtor Range is successful. The review makes a bravy attempt to forecast likely earning; of these new ventures. It reckon! that the Ka'mbalda nickel find wil prove a money-spinner with j likely net profit of about $A2.mn a year. Iron ore, it is thought could bring in a net SA430,000 so the current year to March 31 rising to SA689,000 in 1970-71. The 20 per cent.-owned Alco aluminium venture has a smelte capacity of 40,000 tons a yea compared with 54,000 tons a present at the Rio Tinto-Zinc an Kaiser Aluminium partnership Comalco operation which, hom ever, is being increased by further 17,500 tons. Alcoa is n( expected to pay a dividend befoi 1968, but when it does a paymne of, say. 2% per cent. would mea I SA250.000 for Western Mining. Summing up these views. tt Australian brokers come to tt optimistic conclusion that Westes Mining's profit could show a six. fold increase by 1969. Theer will of course, be a larger capital0A, service: 6.3m. shares rank at present for dividends while a further 2m. will come into the list next July and the current rights issue will bring in 2.5m. more shares for dividend qualification in January, 1969. Undoubtedly a long-term growth proposition. Western Mining are currently 44s in London to yield a modest 1.8 per cent. Uranium Dilemma Still looking ahead, we copne to uranium. Slowly and cautiously a free market is emerging for this material. Reserves are more thanv v abundant for the world's needs at present, but in the early 1970's demand is expected to be riding high and there could well be a shortage of uranium in 10 years' time. But in the present cagey market a good deal of thought has been stimulated by the Canadian Government-owned Ontario Hydro's request for tenders by October 11 to supply 5,500 tons, of uranium for its nuclear powerT stations. And what makes this so interesting is that only 1,100 tons is wanted for delivery by 1973, the I rest being called for over the years 1 to 1980. Present uranium prices are in the region of only $5-56 a lb and cur- r rent \" guesstimates \" in this venture into the future range up to $20 a lb ! The outcome of the tenders is clearly going to be an interest 5 r guide to the future price pattetCy of Canadian uranium. d While the Canadian uranium- s only miners burn the midnight oil f. tryng to reach the correct price to a ask, South Africa's gold-uranium )t men can rest easily. Already sell- *e ing on the open market, they know it that with their low costs they can n undercut most other producers. And the higher the Canadian price ie levels, the better it will be for ie South African mines in this reviv- n ing market.",

Most family men, embarking on a 10, 15 or 20 year unit linked assurance plan, discount the pos- sibility of death before they collect. They should look at mortality statistics. No one-except the suicide-chooses the time of his i death: no one can be sure that he will not die at a time when equities are once again depressed, and his units are worth less than he has paid for them. With the majority of unit linked assurance schemes, ob the death of the contributor before completion of his saving plan, his dependants receive the units already credited to him or their cash value, together with a cash payment equal to the amount of the remaining cotribu. lions necessary to complete the plan. Thus at a time when they may well need as much hard cash as they can get, his dependants, aithough they get some cash in respect of unpaid future contribu- tions, may be obliged to accept less cash than has been contributed for the units allocated to date, or hold those units in the hope of early market recovery. In recent years, viewed as speculative Investments, with-profit endowments have generally come second to unit trusts or the newer unit linked assurances. But this is the wrong viewpoint. There is the minimum of speculation in a with- profit endowment, where the. profits depend on the whole avai able range of investments: some will come from equities and others from gilts, local authority loans and mortgages. Thus, virtually whatever the state of the economy some profits will accrue; and policyholders will enjoy some in- crease in their ultimate payments. Certainty and security go hand in hand, Security for loan Moreover these profits onc&*' declared and allocated are the policyholder's for all time: market fluctuations cannot take them away again as they can the growth of almost all unit linked assurances. The policyholder and his family need not wait for maturity if extra cash be needed, for endowment profits can be used -as can the basic policy-as security for a loan: or they can be cashed-though their Immediate cash value may be low compared with their maturity value if the maturity date remains some years away,",
