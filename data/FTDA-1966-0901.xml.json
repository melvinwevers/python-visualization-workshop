I understand that special returns prepared by the buyers-listing higher charges for materials, services, goods, and equipment of all kinds-are being supplied to the prices intelligence service operated by the DEA for other Government departments. The scheme has the official backing of the Purchasing Officers Association, though the work is regarded as highly confidential since it involves company buyers sometimes reporting increases ordered by their colleagues' employers.

   "text_content" : "By LEX The technical position must have been important in yester- day's sharp rise in the share index of 5.8 to 302.8--ts best single day's rise for nearly twelve months. Presumably the bear position is predominantly in the leaders, and bear covering may well explain why they ap- peared to be doing so much better yesterday than equities generally. However, the advance was wide* spread enough for 29 per cent, of all FT-quoted stocks to show ries. The public were bargainuntin in a small but persistent way and there were a few institutional buyers. Wall Street's buoyant per- formance yesterday could encour- age more of the same to-day. Sempah The new. chairman of Sempah (Holdings) naturally devoted much of his speech at the annual general meeting to the problem of how to prevent a repetition of the events that gutted Sempah and associated companies of some Â£2.8m. This is a problem well worth solving. but it is hard to agree with the bulk of Mr. Rice's suggestions. He proposes to supplement the 'exist- ng channels for the investigations of companies under a cloud in two principal ways. First the Stock Exchange should be able to nominate an executive director in 'cases where all it can do at present is to withdraw a quotation. Second, in order to prevent fraud as opposed to losses caused by mere mismanagement, \"a panel of City men\" should also be empowered to force the acceptance of a nomi. nated director, where it smells trouble. The reasoning behind these pro. posals seems to be that by the time most shareholders find out some- thing has gone wrong and are pre- pared to make a fuss, it is almost certainly too late. One only has to reflect on how long it took the true position, of Associated Fire Alarms to come to liht. to see this. However just because the present method for shareholders to seek -redress is hopelssly inade- ate It does not follow that it * be scrapped. Even $hskins was able to advance several Ideas that'Woltld both speed up investi. gations by the Board of Trade ga make an Inspector's efforts mo effective. The real answer is to reinforce the powers of the Board of Trade and the seriously under- manned raud Squad, rather than invent now agencies to deal with these cases. But while it is pos. sible and desirable to make fraud more difficult, there is no way of eliminating this risk In public companies where ownership and control are so far apart. Amal. Roadstone Amalgamated Roadstones trad- ing profts in the first half of this year are not badly down at Â£808.000 against Â£948.000, but pre- tax rofits have fallen from Â£540.000 to Â£290.000. To round it off the interim is out from 8 to 6 per cent: The first half, however. is a bad guide to the more lm. portant second six months, and trading conditions have now im prved with local authority work ba tnormal. But the seamen's strike means that the Coastal hipping division will let the side down and group pre-tax profits should run out at Lm. against Â£1.25m. After a full tax charge this last year's i15 per cent. divdend so the final may\" not necessarily follow the interim down. But n a totalof pr cent would leave Amalgamated at 28 6d yielding only 46 pe SuE'nt. with a WE ratio of around 20times. It is true the group should be quick off the mark when demand picks up but in the eantime the share price looks to be a step ahead of events. Sew also Page 12 \"Suits\" The crucial point with Scottish and Universal Investment s the proportion of franked investment income-tax charge the frarnked : ing of 6.246m. shares in the Hoe of Fraser. for this is bound to drop in the current year as a result of Fraser's dividend cut. Prom the income tax charge the franked investment income looks to be Â£810.000 gross of which some Â£505.000 was contributed by Fraser. But the reduced dividend means a drop to Â£430,000 or so in the current year which must place a big strain on the rest of the investment portfolio and on the 49 per cent. holding in Scottish Border Cashmere' to make good the gap. Neither looks capable of doing so if only because the divi- dend freeze will stop it. This means therefore that the Invest- ment income will drop back from providing 16.4 points of earnings to 15 per cent.

This was decided t yeserday's meeting of the Intpr national Coffee Council. The Council adopted an estimat of total world imports for 19666 of 50.6m. bags of which the prob able exports from non-member countries are unlikely to exceed 5 per cent. The figure of 46,5m. bags excludes hipments to the countries curretly included in annex B the socal- \"new\" markets, and certain ship. ments such as into Portugal from it provinces and territories It was also unanimously decided to appoint immediately a represntative working roup to examine the re. quests of various countries for the revision of their baic export qua. The group is to \"make concrete r- commendations to enable the Council to resolve t problem before the nd of the current period of the seventh session.\" Unconfrmed reports indicate that the group will probably recommend selective system for coffee exports ill be introduced with seprate ex- port quotas for the different types of coffee. There is now thought to be every .hance that instead of having the overall export quota for coffee, with ,ut-backs in exports if the averap narket price falls below the \"trt- er\" price of 38 cents a pound, the ifferent types of coffee will be treated separately and have their own \" trier prices. The market will probably be divided among the four basic types- Brazilian (mild arabicas or santos) Central American and Mexican. f Colombian (Menis and African (Robustas). The Central American producers are still thought to have resrvations because they fear that they may fal between two stool Sos demand for the cheaper Robust Son the oe hand, and te higher priced but better quality Brazia and Colombian coffee on the other.

   "text_content" : "By a Comrpondeut LANOLIN, along with chlorophyll, was the product advertisers' dream chemical in the 1950s. This cos- metics crae was really only the top of a wide ran of industrial uses which inclu ati-corrosion compounds so. wings, polishes :nd additives for the eather industry, lubricants for British Railway. fine chemicals and drugs. Lanolin s attradte4 ftrm wool grease, whict ltu Is i -relatively simple by-produc of wool scour- ing. The iteraction of this easily altered supply of the raw material and an oscillating demand pattern for lanolin-shortages of which have followed the Korean, Viet- nam and Second World Wars-has brought about violent ups and downs in the price pattern. At present the price of raw wool grease is averaging about Â£85 a ton. A year ago it reached a peak of Â£250-and just over two years ago it was back in the Â£80 range. As a result the long-term British pro- ducers have resigned themselves to making little or no profit from wool grease for the next two or three years-until speculative grease extractors are forced out of the market once again. Doubled Output The present glut is the direct result of the tripled price of a year ago. This was caused in turn by a temporary boom in the world demand for lanolin of perhaps no more than two or three per cent., attributed in part to the Vietnam war. Swedish and German manu- facturers of the equipment which extracts raw wool grease from wool scouring effluent-previously poured down the drain-were able to point to the inflated world price for grease and sell their equipment (at about Â£30.000 a set) round Europe and in Australia and South America too. Their success is measured by the estimated rise in Sworld wool grease production-a 1 100 per cent increase to around - 20.000 tons a year within two I years. I .Some of this doubled output i came from the long-term extractors - there are about 20 in Britain D associated with wool scouring and r combing plants. The rest came s from new producers, estimated to number 20 to 30. Now with a I world glut and the price at least as o low asthat of a few years ago, it is thought that at least ten of the Snewcomers will have to leave the I business once again. It has all happened before. After the Korean War the stockpilin boom died out Italian wool grease Sproducers had to close down about 60 per cent. of the capacity in their dozen or so plant-prices had Ssnk so low that large quantities were being used as a cheap substi- State for fuel oil. f Costly Process n One mitigating factor in the cur. r rent glut has been a reduced out. e put of wool grease from Bradford. e a traditional source. A change in the city Public Health Act Regula- tions permitted wool soourers to dispose of their effluents without the expensive acid-cracking treat- A ment which had formerly been r equired as a sequel to the centri- y fuging of wastes. 2 When raw wool grease has been a extracted it must undergo a very \" much more complex and costly n process in order to produce sale- i- able lanolin. This has been the b preserve of the U.K. and the U.S., n and the Continent is a large im- y porter. West Germany is one of a the major export markets for the e British-Westbrook Lanolin Com- it pay, which claims the title of the d world's largest lanolin refiner, and h is a subsidiary of Woolcombers of is Bradford. n The current price range for refined lanolinrun from Â£160 pe ton for the crudest grades suited or anti-corrosive compounds to as high as 750 a tof top pharmaceutical and cosmeticano- lin. On the face of it, the collap of the wool grease price might be sen as an opportunity for these large established refiners to buy up cheap stocks of their raw material, but the reserves of capital required and the overall desire for long term stability in the market over- rul the temporary advantage that might thus be gained. Disturbing Move They must now face additional competition from the newer en- trants into the grease extraction market. Faced with the world glut, and the cost of their recently- installed grease extraction plants, some are now resorting to vertical integration as a possible way out of their troubles by venturing into lanolin refining. Some are attempt- ing to do it without chemists on their staffs, and produce only the crudest form of lanolin from doubt. ful raw material, which is suited, nevertheless, to a variety of simple uses where price is more important than quality. This move is disturb. ing to British and American re- finers who had absorbed the peak in the raw material price. It is an added problem to established refiners whose plant is designed for the output of higher grade lanolins only. Old hands in the trade believe that many of their new competitors may eventually suffer where grease extraction plant is using scouring effitent from wool low in grease content as a feedstock. It is a generally-agreed rule that over the years the only extraction plants which can make persistent profits are those using the effluent from at least 70 per cent. Australian Merino wool.",

   "text_content" : "THE STRIKE of Zambian Copper- belt mineworkers has spread to Rbokana's Nkana mine as well as to Nchanga's Bancroft property, which means that all mines except Chibuluma are affected and that the number of men idle is about 18.000. Indications are that the situation has worsened at Nchang and at the Luanshya division of Roan Selection Trust. At Chambishi, there was a walk out of about 50 men employed by a contractor, but this was sai to be unrelated to the main Copperbelt strike. The Minister of Labour, Mr. M.

Most ssues closed below the best, however, on late profit- taking. After touching 796.49, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered a further 12.69 to 788.41-the largest rise since last July 6- against a day's low of 777.44. For August the Average, however, has declined a net 58.97, bringing the net loss for the first eight months of 1966 to 180.85. The Railroad Index rallied 2.72 on the day to 195.76 and the Utilities Index rose 1.76 to 121.33. Volume decreased 2.54m. shares to 8.69m., while of the 1,431 issues traded 988 advanced. Helping to create hesitation at times wereports of increasing pressure in Congress for tax law revisions and other steps that might arrest the interest rate rise and ease inflationary pressures. At the same time, chances for enactment of pro- posals in the current session of Congress were considered slim without Administration support. While volume was well below yesterday, leadership was good and featured quality Industrials. Numerous so-called \"glamour\" shares were bogged down by profit- taking after sharp recoveries yes- terday. Airlines tended to fade after earlier further firmness. Most Steels were higher, with gains of $1 shown by U.S. Steel at S39Y and Jones and Laughlin at $48.

Airline ended irregular. North- West advanced 53% to $92. but KLM sagged $3 to $125. Among so-called \"glamour\" shares, Fairchild Camera lost $5% to $178% after yesterday's market- leading $19 spurt. Motorola de- clined S76 to $156, Corning Glass fell S8 to $292% and Xerox dipped $5 to $177%. Montgomery Ward gave way $3 to S28 xd on lower earnings. Leading Motors were higher, led by Ford with a St % advance to $42%. Helping to attract buy- ing was Chrysler's forecast that 1967 car sales would be at about the same pace as the 9.lt. units (including imports) in 1966. Canada Moves Up All major sections also rallied in light trading on Canadian Stock Markets. Traders attributed the rise largely to a technical recovery. Meanwhile, the lay-off of workers has started in a small way in many Canadian industries but is expected to accelerate as effects of the rail strike become more pronounced. Banks paced the advance with Bank of Nova Scotia advancing more than 52. Bank of Montreal rising over $1 and Royal Bank gaining nearly $1.",

Chrysler is the first of the\" Big Three\" to prepare Press previews of its 1967 models, which will start to reach the market in October, Mr. Townsend was confident that the new models would have a fine send-off as sales prospects appeared particularly favourable for the fourth quarter of this year. Though he added \"thatindustry sales for the full year would be down from 1965, he pointed out that the setbacks appeared less dis- couraging when allowance was made for the fact that 1965 sales were artificially boosted by about 300,000 units from the hangover demand following strikes against car makers late in the previous year.",

The 14 extinguishers represent the larget gl order received by Cardox for this equipment. From Our Own Correspondent ^I`'\"\" ' \"' THE LIBERAL minority Govern- ment made a new bid to-night to bring about a settlement of the national rail strike. Meetings with representatives of the strikers were held by the Labour Minister, Mr. J. R. Nicholson, following a Government assurance voiced in the Commons last night that rail- way men on strike would receive a final wage increase of not less than 18 per cent. Replying to bitter attacks from the Opposition in the Commons, the Health Minister, Mr. A. J. MacEachen, said the Government had been criticised for its end-the- strike Bill only providing an interim wage increase of 8 per cent, but he insisted the 8 per cent increase was being misrepresented as a final settlement. Mr. MacEachen pointed out that further negotiations would un- doubtedly result in a settlement as high as 18 per cent. at least, which was the. recommendation of the Conciliation Board. Mr. MacEachen accused the Opposition Sleader, Mr. John Diefenbaker, and the New Democratic Party of dis- torting the Government's back-to- work measure. Mr. Diefenbaker demanded to \"kiow if the Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson, was offering a secret new wage deal. Mr. Pearson interjected to say there were no secret deals. The House of Commons to-night defeated an Opposition Conservative r amendment aimed at scrapping the * Government Bill to end the nation's Sfiveday-old railway strike. The vote Swas 138 to 110. OTTAWA, August 31. The Government is concerned with reports from across the country that even if the Bill passes Parliament, many railwaymen will refuse to return to work because they are dis- satisfied with the Government interim wage increase of 8 per cent. They want the 18 per cent. spelled out in the Bill. The debate continued to-day. Meanwhile, Reuter reports from Toronto that General Motors Cot- poration is closing two plants of its subsidiary, McKinnon Industries, be. cause of the nation-wide rail strike in Canada. The plant at St. Catherine's, employing 4,700 workers, will be shut down to-night and the unit at Windsor, with 600 employees, will close to-morrow morning. The main plant of General Motors, at Oshawa, will continue normally at least until the end of next week. The first 1967 models are due to come off the assembly line there to-day.",

This morning Senator Russell Long, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who is never slow to Jtmp on a band wagon. tabled a Bill to suspend the 7 per cent. tax subsidy on business am- vestment instituted by the Ken- nedy Administration. This expedient, which was sug- gested by the Joint Economic Com- mittee of Congress only this spring during the last serious public dis- cussion of a tax increase, would reduce funds available for invest- ment by business by about $2,000m. in a full year. Whether the Administration finally takes the plunge or not- and if so how--depends on a complex series,.of political and economic calculations. Last week President Johnson was stating both publicly and privately that be could not mak up is mind until he knew how much mmore ew would vote on the Great Society. programmes, or how much the supplementary defence estimates arising from the Vietnam wa would be. Mood of urgency However, events of the past few days appear to have caused a mood of greater urgency. There have been, notably, the sharp fall in the Stock Market, the extrely uncertain (and from tbe Govern ment's point of view even more alarming) state of the bond market, the icrease in farm prices last month, and the increa ngly bitter complaints about high interest rates from Congressmen who fear that they are now being hurt politically. If these factors do tip the balance in favour of an early tax increase, prudence would seem to dictate action on the following lines. 1-Since the budgetary considera- tions mentioned by teL Preent still apply, a vast anti4infatonary pro rmirme takint, ay, SS,0Osm. to 10 m. from the economy seems --What makes more sense Is a pinpoint attack on interest rate by some action designed to ease the scramble or investment funds. 3-A rise in income-tax would prob- blyhave to be accompan for eqties' sake, by a corporation tax increase-and vice versa. But since an income-tax increase is virtually ruled out by the approach of the autumn electons, some other expedient needs to be found. Ihese points make the repeal of the Investment Tax credit e most attractive option oen to the Presi- dent In political term it mibt cause the nal collapse of Mr. Johnson's precarious consensus with the business community, but in the 9t rather desperate mood of it would be likely to get ja a lesser evi than an un. lncrease in personal income tax. ~-Â·r ---",

   "text_content" : "BY THE TIME the U.S. super- sonic airliner goes into passenger service in 1974 the programme will have cost the U.S. Government, aircraft companies and private in- vestors about $4,500m. This and other details of the Government's plans for financing the project have been given here by Senator Warren Magnuson, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. These plans follow closely the recommendations made three years ago by Mr. Eugene Black, former president of the World Bank, and Mr. Stanley Osborne, a New York investment banker, who made a study of the subject for President Kennedy. The $4,500m. overall figure breaks down as follows: $l,300m. for the development cost throug construction and 100 hours' flight test of two aircraft of a single design; 800m. to support certifica- tion of the aircraft and to develop the production base;and S2,000m.- $2,500m. for the actual production of the SSTs (supersonic transports). Work done so far on the pro- ject has been financed 75 per cent by the Government and 25 per cent. by the competing companies (Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Company for the air- frames, General Electric and Pratt and Whitney-a division of United Aircraft-for the engines). The companies have continually argued that they could not maintain this share of the whole programme. For the coming prototype phase of the programme, the Government plans to pay 90 per cent. of the cost -although it hopes to recover all its money if the aircraft is a success. The source of the 800m. is still uncertain, but financing of the $2,000m.plus pro. duction stage is expected to come from private sources. Senator Magnuson said here that, although \"neitiations have not been concluded wd ill not be until a firm contract has been signed.\" the WASHINGTON, August 31. companies involved \"have expressed agreement with these terms.\" This scheme will apply to work beginning early next year, after President Johnson has revealed which com- panies are to continue with their efforts: all competing companies must submit their plans to the Federal Aviation Agency next week for examination by over 200 Government experts. The manufacturers chosen will pay 20 per cent. of allowable costs, but this share includes a credit for a 10 per cent. fee. The fee will not be paid, but will be credited towards the manu- facturers' contribution-so in effect the Government will carry 90 per cent. ot the costs. When the prototype construction phase is finished-late in 1969, accord- mag to present calculations-those companies still in the reckoning will have invested about 90m. each, Senator Magnuson revealed. \"In addition. each must outlay amounts estimated to be $20m. to S30m. for interest, customer relations, and other costs not allowable under the terms of the contrast.\" I . ed _dr rutrw",

Extracts froim the Satem by tle Chairman, Lord Renwick, K.BE., appear on this page. 11 El I Â· I .Â· ~;I~*, says \"Results no less than excellent\" EXPANSION The Chairman of a Company which, is expanding so rapidly as Associated Television naturally finds himself at a disadvantage in preparing a Report which must suffer some delay before it can reach the hands of the share- holders. Accordingly, even though these developments have occurred after the end of the financial year under review, I feel that I should report several new acquisitions to your Group's interests. First, there is our joint undertaking with Chappell's in music publish- ing through our acquisition of a 50% interest in two companies New World Music Limited and Jubilee Music Inc. Secondly, there is the 50% in- terest in a new publishing com- pany to be formed Jointly with the International Publishing Cor- poration to operate in the general field of educational and industrial training publications and in connection with television pro- grammes. Thirdly, we have now acquired the remaining 50% of Pye Records making the company a 100% subsidiary of ours. In addition we have acquired the remaining 49% minority In- terest In J. Rosenthal (Toys) and are arranging for the acquisition of a 70% interest in an insurance company already established by IPC, Reeds Paper Group and Eagle Star, THEATRES In my last Report, I referred to your Company's \"largest and most important single invest- ment\" in the shape of the acqui- sitlon of the whole of the share capital of the Stoll Theatres Cor- poration and of Moss Emplres. I am now happy to be able to speak of the eminently satisfac- tory- indeed substantially Im. proved -reults of the Theatre Group, under the Chairmlnship of Mr. Prince Littler, A new record was established for the London Palladium; end, throughout the Wet End, our theatres played to well-filled houses, Conspiouous amon other successes has been NoIl Coward's reportoire of three plays at th Queen's Thetre wh PROFITS, TAX AND LEVY The consolidated Profit and Loss Account shows a profit for the Group, before Levy and taxation of Â£11,059,311. This represents an increase of Â£1,699,370 over the results of the previous year (Â£9,359,941). Moreover, this year's trading has had to bear the full brunt of 12 months' Levy on Television Advertising Revenue. Thus, the sum of Â£5,432,366 had to be set aside for this purpose, as against the sum of Â£3,837,593 for the 8 months of the year to the 4th April, 1965-the year in which the Levy was introduced. Taxation for the year amounts to Â£2,780,325 as against last year's figure of Â£2,752,639. In total, therefore, Levy and taxation have consumed no less than Â£8,212,691 (74%) of the Group profit. It should furthermore be noted that this figure of Levy and taxation pay- able to the Exchequer is in addition to the sum of Â£985,253 payable to the Independent Television Authority for the rental of the London and Midlands transmitters. Nevertheless, the Group profit after Levy and taxation amounts to the final. figure of Â£2,846,620 as compared with Â£2,769,709 for the previous year. ATV NETWORK In my last year's Statement I re- ferred to your Company's policy of \"planned xpansion\". As this expansion of activities extended into fields other than television, it became' increasingly apparent to your Board that a completely' new Company framework was required. Accordingly, steps were taken to reconstruct the Group in such a way that the parent Company would become purely the holding Company of its various trading subsidiaries- including a new TV WORLD The Midlands programme journal for Independent Television is published by Odhams Press Limited on behalf of ATV Network and ABC Television Limited. The MERCHANDISING In none of your Company's sub- sidiaries has expansion been more rapid or more satisfactory. The publishing venture, in assocl- ation with the News of the World Organisation of the two mag-. zines \"TV Century 21\" and \"Lady Penelope\", has proved eminently successful, and their combined COLOUR Colour on the 408-llne stndard could be made Immediately avail- able to the entire British receiving public in the existing VHP ser- vices Those viewers content to, subsidiary company to be en- trusted with the Television Service operated under licence from the Independent Television Authority.

BOWLING EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY In June your Directors announced the intention of recommending a final dividend of 10%, making a total of 26% for the year. The year's accounts were accordingly drawn up on this basis. In view, however, of the Government White Paper, \"Prices and Incomes Standstill\", I have to tell you that your Directors now feel bound to recommend that the final dividend should be 6/% and not 10%, thus leaving the total dividend at 22i%, as for the previous year. EXPORTS For the first time in television history, British. series have been purchased simultaneously by all three American TV Networks. Columbia Broadcasting System purchased 45 episodes of \"Secret Agent\" (known to British viewers as \"Danger Man\"), the National Broadcasting Company pur- chased \"The Saint\", and \"The London Palladium Show\", andthe American Broadcasting Company purchased \"The Baron\", \"Court Martial\" (jointly produced with MCA), and \"McGill\", a new FILM- MAKING Another intensive programme of film production is currently in hand, Including \"The Saint' and \"McGill\" together with a new Patrick McGoohan series \"The Prisoner\". ates in Birmingham, and has proved to be nationally popular.

Sseries for next season. The triple jackpot of selling to all three networks has at last fallen into British hands. I am glad, moreover, to be able to say that, for the Eastern Hemis- phere, the sales curve of ITC continues to point sharply up- wards. Indeed, for the first six months of the current calendar year total sales approximate to the whole of the previous 12 months' turnover. These sales have been made in more than 50 different countries. PYE RECORDS This is the first Annual Report In which I am able to refer to Pye Records as a wholly-owned sub- sidiary, even though the results contained within the Consoli- dated Profit and Loss Account reflect only the dividends received under the 50% ownership which then existed. During the pastyear, Pye Records has maintained a leading position within the industry. Although in the United States the sudden vogue for British Pop records has somewhat deollned, sales have remained good and the overseas sales of Pye Records in other markets have shown a steady Improvement.

Compensation The Greek ministers were prepared to listen sympathetically to Rumania's views, though Greece is so firmly i committed to the North Atlantic alliance that it would rule out at the outset any radical reorientation of its Balkan policy. The Greek side quite frankly expects that if any substantial result is to come out of the Rumanian leader's visit, the Rumanians must show more understanding in the ques- tion of paying adequate compensation to Greek citizens for their property nationalised in Rumania. Lengthy and i difficult negotiations to that effect l which have been held in Bucharest recentlX between Greek and Rumanian delgations broke down on the eve of teAthens visit. It is understood that the dispute concerns the prpperty of 1,250 Greeks whose value has been esti- mated by the Greek side at between $7m. and $8m., but for which the Rumanians are willing to pay only $2m. to $3m. It is not excluded that Mr. Maurer. while at Athens, will announce a new formula contributing to bridging the gap between the two sides. Otherwise the Greeks do not appear very enthusiastic about going ahead with the conclusion of a series of seven agreements which the Rumanians are proposing, covering such diverse topics as commercial exchanges payment for goods exchanged, air communications, tele- communications, tourist traffic, cul- tural relations and shipping. Out of all these agreements proposed by the Rumanians, the Greeks are primarily interested in the last one, covering shipping transportation be- tween the two countries. .",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent AMERICAN influence has success- fully prevented the sale to South Africa of three twin jet Mystbre 20 aircraft by France's Marcel Das- sault company, informed sources revealed here to-day. The Mystere 20 incorporates turbo- jet engines made in America by General Electric, and the US. observes a complete embargo on sales of military equipment to South Africa. But aviation industry circles here expressed surprise at the decision as the Mystbre 20-unlike its earlier fighter-plane namesake-is a civilian aircraft of the \" executive jet\" sort. The means and channels by which ,the pressure was exerted remain some- what mysterious. The Qual d'Orsay says it had no information on the PARIS, August 31. matter, and an official spokesman for the Dassault company declined all comment. The U.S. Embassy in Paris also refused to comment. Although it is possible that the Dassault decision was the result of an official U.S. threat to ban further sales to Dassault of the General Electric engines, it is likely that reproe sentations were made to Dassault not by American Government officials but by a commercial company-either General Electric or Pan American Airlines, which is a major' Dassault customer.

It is claimed that the cost of the project would be considerably less than' building a stationary mill on the spot and that the floating mill could be moved from area to area as raw materials within easy reach are exhausted. Home production of pulp in a developing country could result in a powerful stimulus to its economy, according to Eriksbergs. The plan envisages a modern pulp mill built into a specially constructed shallow draft ship which could be towed up rivers to suitable sites where there are insufficient roads or other com- munications. The mill would work according to the bisulphate process with magnesium as a basis. This would enable a wide range of raw materials to be used such as bamboo, bagasse and straw. Eriksbergs states that over an initial production period of eight years investments would be expected to be repaid with reasonable interest. The mill would then become the property of the country in question and would have a useful life of another 15 years. An annual output of 40,000 tons would require an investment of Â£3.4m. and would return a gross annual profit of Â£800,000. The price of the pulp ex-factory is provisionally assumed at Â£40 per ton, against production costs of Â£10 per ton. Overheads are estimated at about Â£350,000 and a capital repayment, at 8 per cent. over eight years would involve Â£600,000 per annum, leaving an annual net profit of Â£280,000. It is believed that some paper makers in Sweden are not over-enthusiastic about the project, how- ever. They are putting into operation mills with an annual capacity of getting on for 3000,000 tons and appear to thin hat even with cheap local labour and an abundant supply of inexpensive raw materials the production rate will be too low for an economic return.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent AN EXCESSIVELY high trade deficit and a downward trend in industrial output, coupled with a stagnation in investments, have been the major features of the economic situation during the sum- mer season in Austria. The monthly report just pub- lished by the Austrian Institute for Economic Research comes to the gloomy conclusion that hopes of a vigorous upswing, voiced at the beginning of the spring, have not been borne out by subsequent developments. Overall industrial output (ex- cluding power) in June showed a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, the lowest this year with the exception of January. While some of the consumer goods sectors (textiles, leather, food, etc.) managed to raise their output, production of finished capital goods in June was actually one per cent below the levels i the same month last year. The rising pressure of imports and the stagnation in investments are mentioned as the main factor be- hind the disappointing performance of this sector. VIENNA. August 31. The influx of imported products has badly hit the producers of con. sumer durables. res published to-day by the Central Office for Statistics show that the accumulated trade deficit during the first half of 1966 reached an all-time high of Sch.8Â±950rm (124m.).",

   "text_content" : "$s Oliuhm Convpoudat, NEW CAR registrations on the Swedish market for the first seven months ns this year were approxi- mately 28 per cent. down compared with the same period last year. The reduction has not only applied to imported cars but also to both home manufactured makes. Saab has shown i decline of nearly 7,000 units or about 40 per cent., while Volvo sales have dropped to a com-. paratively lesser extent from 35,455 ast year to27,126 n 1966. The decline is genrally accounted for by three main reasons: a particularly severe winter lasting until well into May, a tight credit policy and uncer- tainty over the wage negotiations, which came nearer to strike action than at any time since the last war. Saab in an effort to underpin its flaging home sales has introduced a four-stroke, four cylinder engine of 1.7 litres capacity into its tradi- tional two-stroke range, which has gven the car better performance. Volvo announced this month a completely new model which ex- tends its range into the middle- sized family car market and will compete- with-among others-the Ford Taunus and the BMW 1800. Lost Ground The reduction in home sales is certainly a setback, and Volvo now feels that total new registra- tions on the Swedish market will not reach last year's peak of 250,000. Although the company is optimistic that the second half of the year will see some pick-up, as their managing director, Mr. Gunnar Engellau, has stated, it will be impossible to make up for lost ground. \"Sales,\" he says, \"have probably been rising a little too fast over the last five years and there may be a tendency now for the curve to flatten out a little.\" Although Volvo's image is mainly focused on car production, last year this sector of its busi- ness accounted for only about one- third of its total sales of Kr. 2,800m. The company is diversi- fied into aircraft jet engines, marine and industrial engines, trucks, agricultural tractors, machine tools and printing presses. The company is exportoriented, and group exports last year amounted to Kr. ,026m., a rise of 14 per cent. Of total vehicle out- put of 145.136 units in 1965, some M8.000 were sold overseas. The new factory at Torslanda-outside othenburg-which was opened in 964 has an annual capacity of 200,000 units and current produc tion is running at about 75 per cent The new model will prob- ably only reach around 3.000 units this year, but as it is phased in, production is expected to grow to pro The Volvo 144 procucuon is expec to ow to o Uno r[out ana rear enos or me car cnZ 1 i a :r 50,000 units during 1967. By 1969-1970 car production should have reached capacity at the Tors- landa works, and at this point the company will have to make a major decision whether to increase facilities at Torslanda or go over- seas, or a combination of.both. Already the company has manu- facturing facilities in Belgium and Canada. Current investment in the group ran at about Kr.170m. during 1965 and the company spent Kr.150m. on the new model for technical development, dies, tools and re- search. Overall production of auto- mobiles now includes the new 144 model, the Amazon range and the sports P 1800 model. The latter has now been in production for about five years and has met with considerable success as a status symbol sports car. But the com- pany is looking ahead and may well introduce another sports model with a new design in the not too distant future. In the post-war years the com- pan built its automobile future on the PV 544 model. It won a high reputation in rallies all over the world and for its safety-it was claimed that the car could be rolled at 50 mph and the driver walk out unharmed. As in the 544. so in the new 144 model safety is one of the main selling points and includes a dual braking system, an anti-lock compensator preventing the rear wheels locking before the front in emergency braking, and the front and rear ends of the car act as impetus absorbing units in the event of a head-on or rear-end collision. Last year the company intro* duced a completely new range of commercial vehicles without any loss of production, which totalled 13,000 units. Concentration on the export market is more towards the heavy end of the range, and Volvo says that it will be increasing pro- duction to 18,000 units by 1970. At the same time the company is expected to announce its entry into the British truck market some time next year. For a number of years there have been continual rumours in the motor trade that Volvo and Saab would join forces, but this development seems unlikely as the two companies have very little in common and there are few compo- nents which could be interchange- able. Economies could be made in the selling and distribution side, but at this stage it does not seem suffi- cient grounds for a merger.",

The following is his circulated statement. It is a very great pleasure for me to present the second Chairman's Statement to the shareholders since the company was granted a Stock Exchange quotation in 1964. Our profits have increased from Â£526 336 to Â£573564 and we have exceeded the forecast of Â£560,00 SI made in the interim statement issued to shareholders in February 1966. The Directors declared an interim dividend of 15% less Income Tax in February, and now recommend a final dividend of 2j% making a total of 17%% for the year. The Directors wer proposing to recommend a final dividend of 3Y%, making a total distribution for the year of 18%%, but they have maintained the divi- dend at last year's level in view of the Prime Minister's directive. E Fletcher Bulders (Midlands) Lhalted and E Fletcher (Stoke) ULnited These two major subsidiaries have again increased their profit- ability in spite of extremely difficult trading conditions. The turnover of the two companies has achieved a record level in spite of the severe mortgage restriction introduced in June 1965. As I reported in my interim statement, we have set up a regional headquarters in Bristol, and development is proceeding satisfactorily in this area. In June, 1966, the Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent opened our new offices and regional headquarters in Stoke to control the Group's in- creasing activities in the potteries and North West. We are undertaking a number of is substantial contracts with variou is local authorities for package 3, deal\" housing of a traditional r, pattern which have been well re- ceived by authorities having a d modest annual housing require. mont.

   "text_content" : "By Our Medical Corrpot The current outbreak o foot- and-mouth disease: wilh the much publicised report of the farer who was thought (mis- takenly) to have caugh it, has focused attention on a problem that has aroused increasng interest in recent years: the relationship between man and animals so far as disease is con- cerned. It is a subject that has been given its own name - zoonoses, which has been defined by the World Health Organisation as \" those diseases and infections which are natu- rally transmitted between ver- tebrate animals and man.\" WHO lists 86 diseases in this category, 40 of which involve cats and dogs. This is a for- midable list when one bears in mind the national passion for these pets, but there are one or two other sides to the subject that deserve consideration. The first of these is well illus- trated by foot - and mouth disease-namely the rarity with which it is transmitted to man. When one considers the rela- tively close contact there must be between farm hands and in- fected cattle, it is indeed sur- prising that this virus disease does not occur more commonly in man. Laboratory Risk Many an experienced veteri- narian in this field has never encountered a case in man, and even though the textbooks reli- giously refer to its occurrence the experts are chary of accept- ing the diagnosis. Indeed, they rightly refuse to do so, unless the causative virus can be isolated from the ill individual. It is of interest that, of the few proven cases, quite a number, have occurred through labo- ratory workers handling the viruses. This relative immunity of man to infection from animals is well illustrated by three other diseases. One is swine erysipelas, which can kill four out of every five pigs affected but in human beings merely manifests itself as a relatively benign lesion of the skin. Another is leptospe- rosis, a disease transmitted to man from dogs. Since the end of the last war the number of dog licences taken out annually in England and Wales has re- mained around 2% to 2% million. On the available statis- tical evidence this means that at least 500.000 dogs in England and Wales are infected with leptosperosis and in an infec- tious state. Yet the number of notifications of leptosperosis in man has never exceeded SO in any of the last few years. Even more mystifying is the position with regard to anthrax; the causative organism of which is known as Bacillus anthracis. Its occurrence has officially been described as \"infrequent and sporadic in the U.S.. and most industrial countries ... primarily an occupational hazard of industrial workers processing hides, hair and wool and of veterinarians and agri- cultural workers handling in- fected animals.\" Another source of infection is desert-dried animal bones. According to a report in the Scottish Medical Journal. \"these bones are crushed into grist for the manufacture of animal charcoal (used in sugar- refining and other industries) about which there need be no anxiety because, during the process of manufacture, it is heated to around 1,000 degrees Centigrade.\" So far so good. \"But.\" the report continues. -\" while the raw bones are being crushed and the grist is con- veyed to the carbonising plant a great deal of bone-dust passes down through the mill-screens. This, a most valuable by- product, is gathered and sold, untreated, for incorporation in artificial fertilisers. In the laboratory we regularly isolate B. anthracis from about 60 per cent. of all samples of this material brought to us for testing. There is, as yet, no known means of sterilising the bone dust, without destroying its efficacy as a fertiliser, and. incidentally, damaging the cost- competitiveness in both home and export markets of the main product, charcoal, so it is sold in its highly contaminated state and freely handled, in blissful ignorance of its potential infec- tivity, by hundreds of thousands of farmers and gardeners up and down the country.\" Yet, in the four-year period, 1961- 1964, in England and Wales only 42 cases of anthrax were notified, of which only six were attributable to bone-meal. Bang's Disease To a much lesser extent the same thing applies to brucel- losis. This is a widespread disease in cows, which in the past has been known under a variety of names: abortus fever, contagious abortion, and Bang's disease when it occurs in cattle, and undulant fever and Malta fever when it occurs in man. It is estimated that at least 30,000 cows in Britain are secreting the causative organism In their milk, that 22 per cent. of herds are infected, and that 4 to 5 per cent. of churn samples of milk are infected. Yet in the period, 1945-62, the largest number of cases reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service has never exceeded 133 in any pon year and has fallen as low as 56 The experts, however, have a strong opinion that many cases are missed, the illness being given some other name-mainly occause the doctor has not thought of the possibility of brucellosis and therefore has not had the requisite laboratory tests carried out. Indeed, one authority has gone so far as to claim that the annual incidence is around a thousand or more. Serious Problem Be that as it may, it is quite a serious enough problem as it is. It may not be a killing disease, but it can drag on for an almost interminable time and thereby produce an undue amount of invalidism. What is equally worrying is that it is a disease that is largely prevent- able in that in about 75 per cent. of cases in Britain it is milk-borne. What people do not yet realise is that only pasteurised milk is safe in thts respect, and that 6 per cent. of the milk in England and Wales is still unpasteurised. In Scot- land the figure is much higher- 22 per cent., and it has been estimated that in Glasgow alone more than 1.500 gallons are supplied to householders daily in the raw state. As 100 per cent pasteurised milk is probably an unpractical target, the only solution to the problem is to eradicate the disease in cattle. That this can be achieved is evident from the fact that in other countries, such as Scandinavia, it has been eradicated from cattle-and therefore from man. What the human disease costs this coun- try is uncertain, but it has been estimated that the resultant re- duced value of stock costs Â£16m. per annum. What is required, according to one expert, is \"clearing up the inadequate legisation, stan- dardising criteria of infection and freedom from infection, and making arrangements to com- pensate farmers for loss of an animal.\" At present, he con- tends, farmers are \"economic- ally better off if they sell an infected animal in the open market. This.\" he states. \"is a common method of disposal and, of course, it intrdduces the infection elsewhere.\"",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent NEW DELHI, August 31. India's fourth fie-year plaa bha run aIto trable even before Parliament can acept it and the Government can begin to implement it. All Opposition parties have refused to discuss it. They have also rejected the Prime Minister's invitation to participate in the all-party Planning Committee on the ground that the plan was finalised without its consultation. CnÂ«Â« /~Â»mm lt<~- Â«**... -~-Â»L Â«iÂ». l_____ The Committee was formed by the late Mr. Shastri to Involve leading public men in the formula- tion of the plan. The basic objectives of the fourth plan are laudable--a 5.5 per cent. compound growth rate, 18-19m. new jobs, food self. sufficiency and accelerated import substitution. The objectives involve a total outlay of Rs.237,500m. (about Â£11,500m.), a huge sum, but re- presenting only about RsAS per head of population. The hoped-for increase of the national income to Rs.295,000m. by 1971 means a proposed rise of only Rs.69 per head, to Rs.417 in another five years, and in real terms, three more ounces of food- grains a day and two more metres of cloth per year. Errors in calcu. lations, and a couple of bad mon- soons, could upset even these hopes. The proposed public sector expen. diture of Rs.160,000m is almost twice the actal third plan achievement of RA.86,3lOin, entailin a heavy dose of defcit S ann which together with the sharp ri n defence and civil spenditg, has almost crippled the economy. This year it has been pos. sible to provide only Rs.20,820m. The third plan failed despite a mas- sive tax effort, or perhaps because of it. The fourth plan relies on addi. tional taxation of Rs.27,300m.. of which Rs.9,300m. is expected this year. The estimates can have validity only it agricultural incomes are roped in, or else the private sector will be starved of resources. Additional taxation imposed in the name of the plan can also get diverted to defence and other non- plan purposes, adding to inflationary pressures. Large budgetary savings are expected, but similar third plan hopes ended with actual heavy def. cits. Returns of 11 and 12 per cent. are expected of State enterprises, without cost reduction plans. The export target is set at Rs.80,300m.",

   "text_content" : "After all this, the plan as a whole relies on the hope of massive external aid (Rs.63.000m.. including private in. vestment and maintenance imports). an expectation which many think is unrealistic in the context of the changing world climate and the size of India's current external debt-one- fifth of the national income. The proposed private sector invest. ment of Rs.77,500m. is expected to come out of savings, in spite of the deep draft by the State. Since per capita incomes have been almost stationary in the last five years. savings increased only slightly, from 9 to 101 per cent.. according to the Planning Commission, and actually fell, according to unofficial estimates. The priorities this time are, how. ever, right, with agriculture and power allocated one.fifth of the resources, industry about 30 per cent., and the balance going to crucial transport, welfare and family planning programmes. But the plan has harked back to ideology with increased State tradin, antt. monopoly measures, pysical con- trols, etc., all evidently designed to provide an election platform for the Congress, This also explains why defence, now 5 per cent. of the national income, has not been analysed in the context of develop- meat objectives,",

The aim is s uta bmted to use the difference in altitude be- tween the three lakes to pump (or syphon?) watemroni Lake Victoria (3,700 feet above sea level), into. Lake Aert (2a00 feet) and start new irrigation schemes in the areas between the takes. Japane) trate mission was in Dar- eSWell aware of touro Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda potential At its nearest point, Lake Albert is about 120 miles from the shore of Lake Victoria-but the two lakes are connected already by the Nile and Lake rKyoga. There is no water cneconi etween be n Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, which are about 180 miles apart at their nearest points. With their tremendous water resources the three East African countries are well aware of the potential for irrigation. Uganda is particularly well suited, because the river and lake system runs right through the country from south to north, whereas in Kenya and Tanzania the lakes could serve onlbylimited areas. The countries are. however, bound by the Nile Waters Agree- ment, and Egypt and the Sudan would be greatly concerned if it were proposed to take out such large quantities of water for irriga- tion that the normal flow down the Nile was affected. This aspect of the question has become more academic, however, since the r1961 1962 rains which sent the lake 1962 rains which sent the lake levels soaring to unheard-of heights, from which thry have no. where aar recvered Lake Victoria reached its peak in 1964 when the surface was 7 feet higher than the pre-1961 record level. The lake's surface covers nearly 27000 square miles -and the extra water piled up there at that time amounted to Sfet. The lake has in b rly3 feet from the 1964 levels, but no one is pre- pa to suggest when if ever, it wil sin back to the level Which was co ered normal before the 1961 rain ut everyone's calcula- tionJ out of gear: Madhvani Sugar Estate The bigest user of irrigation in East Africa at present is the Madhvani sugar estate at Kakira. Snear Jinja. The first phase of a Slarge-scale scheme was brought I into use on an experimental basis Sin 1959, irrigating 1.500 acres of sugar cane with the aim of increas- ring sugar yields by 30 per cent. I Because of the success achieved i with this scheme, it has since been I expanded, and there are now 6,750 acres under sprinkler irriga- Stion-the biggest scheme of its kind in the world. The capital cost of the installation is high, at over Â£10,000 per acre, but this and the subsequent operating cost is considered to be fully justified by the increase in sugar yields. The estate company say that the crop ideally requires 70 to 75 inches of rain, evenly spread over the year, but natural rainfall averages about 45 inches, and much of this is con- Scentrated in March-May and August-September. By sprinkler Sirrigation it is possible to achieve the ideal. Plans are in hand to extend the Sirriaation over another 6.200 acres, r and when these are complete more than two-thirds of the estate will be under irrigation. There is no land available for the expansion of the estate and the company takes the view that it can operate more efficiently on the basis of the increased production of sugar Sachieved with irrigation. Water is pumped from -a pumping station I on the lake shore, and then cir- Sculated through pipes, with booster I pumps where necessary. , The Ssprinklers are placed in position. Sleft to operate for a set number of hours, and then moved to the next Ssection of the estate where the same process is repeated in a con- Stinuous cycle. While there is nothing else in East Africa using irrigation on such a big scale, a new venture has recently started to produce tea under irrigation at Kerita. 25 miles east of Kampala. This estate, now part of Agricultural Enterprises, a subsidiary of the State-owned Uganda Development Corporation, began in 1920 as a rubber plantation, changed to coffee in 1928, and to tea in 1932. There are now 332 acres of tea there. In 1961, 83 inches of rain fell on the estate. but since then there has \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t been a reduction in rainfall and last year it was only 47 inches. This affected tea production, which fell from 2,030 lbs of made tea per acre in 1961. to 1,132 Ibs in 1965. (Tea requires a minimum of 55 inches of rain a year to produce satisfactory growth.) Spray irrigation is now being used to supplement the natural rainfall, and by this means it is hoped to build up production to 2.200 lbs per acre. Here the water is pumped from a river which is 750 feet below the highest point on the estate. Surveys of the irrigation potential have been carried out in all three East African countries, and these have shown that agricultural pro- duction in many areas could be sharply increased. A former mem- ber of Kenya Legislative Council, Air Commodore A. L. Howard- Williams, fought hard to secure support for an ambitious scheme -_ -- n to pump water from Lake Victoria over an 8,000-foot range of moun- tains (4.000 feet above the lake level) to irrigate dry areas in central Kenya. but with no success. In Uganda, a survey was made in 1964 with help from the British Government, and this suggested that many thousands of acres of undeveloped land could be used for agricultural production by means of irrigation, mainly from Lake Kyoga and the adjoining complex of lakes which covers a wide area in the middle of Uganda. Specific proposals for trial schemes of 1,000 acres each were made, and while these have not yet been im- plemented, they are listed in the new five-year development plan which was adopted by Uganda this year. The idea is that these schemes shall be used to provide experience for possible further development on a much larger scale. With these schemes in mind, the Uganda Government is unlikely to be attracted by the Japanese sugges- tion for linking Lakes Victoria and Albert in a scheme that would certainly be more costly to imple- ment. A controlled market The big question in any con- sideration of irrigation is whether the crop to be grown will bring in a return high enot gh to meet both the capital and operating costs. Ex- perience in Uganda shows that sugar justifies irrigation-but only because the sugar is sold on a con- trolled market inside East Africa. since the production cost is higher than the low levels that have ruled on the free world market. Tea also appears to justify irri- gation under certain conditions, but it is unlikely to suit the hot. parched areas that are most likely to be tested for irrigation schemes. Cotton is an obvious possibility, since the Egyptian and Sudan crops are produced by irrigation. But it would have to be shown that the return from irrigated cul- tivation would justify the extra cost by comparison with the pre- sent rain-grown crops. On a smaller scale, the produc- tion of vegetables could be con- sidered. but East Africa generally produces plenty of these under natural conditions. There is scope for increased exports by air of specialised varieties, such as green peppers and courgettes, .as well as for strawberries, but even here the total area involved would be com- paratively small.",

The second loan will be used in paying off some of Ghana's external debt, which stands at more than Â£250m. Ptogress so far by the new regime in rebuilding Ghanaian society was very satisfactory, said Colonel Afrifa, a member of the Ruling Council responsible for inance, trade and economic affairs.

TIMES was re- assuring. Just as the \"cultural revolu- tion\" and \"socialist reeducation \" drives have interfered with the planned flow of tourists into China this summer so they could prevent the personnel conceried from completing the necessary arrangements for the trade fair. Important Normally several dozen British businessmen attend the Fair, either to buy or sell or to gain information about the year's trading potential. Many important contracts are usually signed at the Canton Fair. and the money China has to spend on Western capital equipment and industrial goods depends directly on her income from the sale of her own export lines, which are also negotiated at Canton. Western traders are also begin- ning to be worried about the posi- tion of the more liberal and prag- matic Chinese trading officials who have been building up Peking's western trade since 1958. from Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade, Lu Hsu-chang down to the skilled negotiators (many of them former capitalist businessmen) who run the various import export corpora- tions. These people, with whom some British traders have formed excel- lent working relations, are vulner- able to the present purge and to the puritanism of the Red Guards. Most of them are from middle class backgrounds, and their work involves a good deal of entertain- ing of foreign guests in the tradi- tionally generous Chinese style. It is hard for them to display the austerity which is currently being demanded. Exempted Until now, like the nuclear scientists, these men have been exempted from some of the more time-wasting aspects of life under Communism, and there have so far been no announced replacements. But some of the trade officials have disappeared from view in recent weeks, and in one or two cases their work is being done by sub- stitutes. Mr. Li Meng-hou, Chingse commercial counsellor in London, has utexipectedly been re- called to Peking for three months. , f the Canton Fair is postponed or cancelled, and if there is a big shuffle in state tradino norsonnn' ... ... .. . .. ... .. 411 J l then the boom In Sino-British trade could subside. British exports would be hit in two Ways. Current negotiations could be- come protracted by the need to discuss the details with a new set of authorities. IC, for instance, is said to be still bargaining with the Chinese over the siting and raw materials supply of a Â£4.5m. high- pressure polyethylene plant. The contract for this was signed some time ago, however, and it is unlikely the Chinese will renege on it. Similarly, the Rio Tinto- Zinc Corporaton contract to deliver an Imperial Smelting Fur nace is thought safe. Interruption But in the longer run, any inter- ruption in the normal flow of China's exports would cause her to reduce her import plans corres- pondingly. The Spring Fair at Canton this year had in any case caused widespread disappointment among Western traders. The pros- pects then did not seem too bright, and the Chinese were apparently inhibited from committing them- selves to delivery of large amounts of traditional export lines. No doubt this reflected the har- vests, which have been less bounti- ful this year thin had been hoped, but the need for stockpiling in case of escalation of the Vietnamese war. and the Chinese undertaking to supply North Vietnam with foodstuffs, consumer goods and light arms, was also a factor. If this trend of reduced exports by China is -now accelerated, then the foreign exchange will not be- come available for some -of the machinery and materials for which the Chinese have made tentative enquiries. Doubts are therefore being expressed about the pro- jected Â£60m. Demag Steel com- plex, and the conventional power station for which English Electric and AEI are understood to have submitted separate bids. As far as anyone knows at this moment, the Scientific Instrument Manufacturers' Association will hold its exhibition in Tientsin from September 12, as planned. Things have proceeded too far for any postponement except at a cost which would frighten away small Western firms from the Chinese market for some time. About ,150 Britons will be assembling in this northern Chinese city. and this will afford the first chance to see what damage has been done to the Chinese trading machine and to this team of men whom Westerners havw always re- garded as able, tough, shrewd and Impeccably patriotic. Another indicator will be the Shanghai Garments Fair. now in progress. Few Westerners go to this, the articles being of more interest to Asian and African buyers. Reports should soon he trickling back to Hong Kong, how- ever. which would shed light on the extent to which the political upheaval is affecting routine trade relations. China herself would be the prin- cipal victim of any turnabout in trade. But British exporters may also find their expectations disap- pointed over the next year or two as a result.",

While theeerewe a few, usually large, industrial organisations whose labour relations and general efficiency were as good as or bettcr than anything in the world, the pamphlet argues that there was mass of companies who had made little or no effort to pro. oi|e gtood indusutial relatinsa. i trote $dod industrial Ylations.

To combat this, the employers' organisations are urged to support training schemes in the art of management and communications. New Attitudes In the last analysis it was only by a change in the will and ati- tudes of management that better industrial relations would be fostered. The pamphlet advocates that the trade unions for their part; should be strongU eltclest, and properly re. fleet the views of their members. Membership of trade unions should be epeouraged, but the idea of the closed shop is ejected. LOMBARD is on holiday Legislation to outlaw unofficial strikes would be impossible to operate and would bring the law into contempt, but the group believes that the unions and the TUC should be encouraged to adopt wider powers of control over unofficial strikes.

   "text_content" : "IT IS NOW clear that, as seemed probable at the time, the sharp rise in profits reported by com- panies which published their accounts during uly * was a statistical freak. The August figures restore the previous trend-5.4 per cent up on the year in the first quarter of 1966, 4.1 per cent. in the second quarter, and now, in August, only 3.7 per cent. Dividend pay- ments, which also rose sharply during July, have followed the pattern set by profits: in August, as in the first quarter, they were up on the year by only 1.7 per cent. There is plainly no need at present to take special measures to freeze this particular sort of income. Steeper decline There is no reason, moreover, to suppose that the pressure on company profits has yet begun to ease. The Board of Trade's analysis of quoted companies with a financial year ending in December, 1965, showed a 3 per cent. rise in profits- a figure that squares well enough both with the August figure Smentioned above and with the results of the sample inquiry made every quarter by the Central Statistical Office into Sprofits generally. But the inquiry into first-quarter profits showed that there had been no rise at all over the past 12 months, and this state of affairs will prob- ably soon be reflected in published company accounts. Profits appear to have reached their peak, in fact. at the beginning of 1965: since then they have been very gradually declining. The likelihood is that the decline will now become steeper. A drop in profits-and even published profits are already lower in one-third of the indus- tries distinguished in our regular analysis-affects plans for new capital investment in two ways: it makes the investment seem less attractive and the cash needed to finance the investment more difficult to come by. Even in May. before the latest restric- tions, companies had revised downwards their investment plans for 1966 and there is little doubt that spending will fall during 1967. It may be that more firms are now conscious of the dliadvantages of being short of capacity when demand turns up, that more than in the past will continue to invest throughout the downswing of the busines cycle, and that the level of investment wil -drop less this time-a the National Institute suggests--than it did last. But money is a good deal dearer and tighter now than it has been in other periods of ,r- striction. Bank credit is already hard to come by. Fixed-interest capital is expensive and the queue for debentures is long; equity capital is even more ex- pensive, thanks to the corpora- tion tax, and the outlook for profits makes this a bad time for many firms to come to the market. Company liquidity is already low and will be further reduced by the handing over to the Revenue of tax deducted from dividends and by the com- mencement of the selective em- ployment tax. With profits falling, even those firms that are anxious to maintain a high level of investment may find it difficult to raise the finance. Cash grants In this situation, the change from investment allowances to cash grants could serve a useful purpose. The main object of the change was to provide busiiess- men with an investment incen- tive too obvious to overlook or misunderstood. But cash grants are likely to be more than usually attractive at a time hen cah is difficult to come by in other ways, If the Government wishes to encourage the investment on which faster growth in the future depends, it should forget about the cost to the Exchequer and begin paying out its grants as soon as. is administratively prac- ticable. rr r. .Â· r",

   "text_content" : "THE U.S. GOLD drain conti. nues. The fact that there was an outflow from the U.S. reserves for the fifth consecutive month during July was not unexpected. Despite President Johnson's words at the beginning of the year in his State of the Union Message about the need to \"wipe out the balance of pay- monts deficit altogether.\" there is still some way to go, as the figures for the second quarter showed.

   "text_content" : "ANTONY HARRIS, Our Comercial Editor A T the beginning of this year we suggested, in a survey of the investmtent programme of the Central Elec- tricity Generating Board, that it was not likely that the very high rate of expansion now in hand could be maintained. Since that time no new orders for generat- ing plant have been placed. Economic expansion has ground to a virtual halt; discoveries of natural gas have started a new debate on national energy policy, and there have been a number of suggestions that the current investment programme in elec- tricity is overblown, especially at a ime of economic stringency. .-Sharp Correction There is no longer any ques tion that theprogrammewi dip sharply after 1969-the declared rogramme, for 1970 cals for 2,500 MWof new capacity, com- pared with over 6,00 MW in the peak year, 1968. The ques- tion now is whether the plant manufacturers are facing a short, harp correction- while reality catches up with the late lamented National Plan, or a prolonged setback which might stretch as farforward as 1980. The question has been given an adde urgency in the City by the issue of a closely-argued analysis by a major stockbroker which casts doubts upon the assumptions behind the present programme, quite apart from the economic disappointments which are setting back expan- sion. This argues basically that SOne of the 500MW st for Klugnorth mnder4 coutructio at Plarone Eith works. household use of electricity has been subsidised ever since the war at the expense of industry: low charges have fostered an unnatural and uneconomic rate of growth, especially in electric heating. It concludes that the national- ised industry will have to put this right by charging more to s householders just as gas Is e becoming cheaper and more : plentiful, so that growth in a electricity sales will fall off e whatever happens in the c economy at large. The effect on investment would be even I- sharper, because ideally the it growth of the peak demand o (made on very cold winter days) 1 should be slowed down more i than demand in general: and it i is the size of this peak demand t rather than the level of sales s which determines the amount i of generating plant needed. I Against this background, the i present programme indeed looks I dangerously exposed. The basis )is a forecast peak demand of is ly cy m id it is ie Id Id 4f is id to 1t id it is 1Ps es Id Id >n kd at at Ce n to te 34,000 MW in 1970 (this after a a downward revision in the last p year). Adding the target of 17 al per cent. spare capacity, one gets p a required plant capacity of 63,200 MW. The actual total of t plant in use and under construc- p tion would give a capacity just above this fairly generous target, a if it was all commissioned on ti time. Above all, the target o capacity of 54,000 MW implies - a faster rate of growth in the f second half of the 1960s than in 3 the first half (roughly 7.7 per tl cent. annually instead of 6.7 it per cent. annually) when the tl economic outlook would suggest f a slowing down. Delivery Dates d Electricity plant takes a long C time to build, so there is no scope a for cuts in the present pro. t gramme. The stations ordered are already under construction, d e Sand the Generating Board has at i present some Â£800m. tied up in s partly-built plant. It is costing some Â£60m. annually to service i this capital-getting on for a d tenth of total revenue. The Ca Board is therefore pressing tl manufacturers to meet their de. y livery dates, though the plant h manufacturers might welcome b e some stretching out: the delays a it due to the inevitable teething a d troubles of the very large effi- t< %s cient generating sets now being s; it built are already proving expen- vr sive enough.

For this reasonthe tl requirement by the mild-70s would only have recovered to Sperhaps 3,600 MW annually- around three-fifths of the rate at â¢ present. It would require quite improbable export achievements to keep manufacturing capacity profitably occupied. SAt first sight, the arguments are impressive. It is certainly true that part of the peak sales Sos electricity are made at a loss I -the oldest stations in the system generate at a cost of over S3d units which are sold for less Sthan 2d. Since domestic heating 'is the \"peakiest\" of all loads, Sthere would seem to be a case Sfor charging householders more. SThe Electricity Council, which is responsible for sales strategy, does not see it like that. SCertainly, great efforts are being Smade to improve load factor- the continuing campaign for I off-peak storage heaters is one Sexample. There are also some t interesting experiments being I made in differential charging to I encourage consumers to avoid Simposing severe peaks of t demand, or to pay for the high- cost electricity they use. But g these will take some years to Syield results. Meanwhile, house- t hold sales as a whole show a P handsome profit. As long ts I most supplies are sold through g a single meter, what matters is to encourage the growth of Ssales: the few hours or days when vower is sold at a loss can, I in effect, be counted as a I THE AGE OF PLANT IN USE S (Figures for 1965) Age Capacity (000 MW) S Under 5 years 9.3 5.9 8.9 10-14 6.6 r 15-19 2.2 20-24 2.5 r Over 25 6.6 I promotional expense-especially since the really heavy capital ' cost, peak or no peak, is 1 connecting a new consumer in Sthe first place.

It is already reduced ;o a very low frequency during the day and at this level the service stands to lose custom rathei than to gain any. London Transport have said that they want more lines and it seems to be a \"natural\" for this Ealing-Greenford line to be in- corporated into the Central Line system. Ealing Broadway would cease to be a terminal point and instead trains to that destination would proceed either to GOrocford or rond a loop to Perivale and an back into London. For this to happen in both directions, the track will need doubling and, of course, electrification, but the basic route is already in existence. There seems to me to be great merit in trying to sew the ends of our Underground system into loops in the manner adopted in some of Southern Region suburban services and in creating more interchange points. The transfer of the Ealing- Greenford line to London Trans- port would facilitate more con- tinuous working of rolling stock and a much better service in the locality. Even in this same western area of .London there are possibilities for new interchange points between the Central, Piccadilly and Western Region lines which could promote more traffi for the railways (and therefore less for our urban roads) by virtue of the greater convenience to the public.

   "text_content" : "By Oar Labour Reporter . : i The EnghAserg Emupyer' Federation yesterday offered a national agreement on hours and conditions-it could ultimately affect over . whitecollar workers-at talks with engineering uWnion leaders in London. Mr. Gordon Baker, president of the EEF, said it \"could be the most important industrial relations development in recent years.\" At present there is no national procedure on overtime, holidays, shift work, redundancy payments, sickness and termination of emn ployment for white-collar engineer- ng workers, and this has resulted in an administrative bottleneck in dealing with disputed cases Lo'nger Holidays The EEF hopes to agree with the whitecollar unions on a specified procedure offering longer holidays for a slightly longer working week. An EEF statement after the meet in said:.\" One of the most origi- nal proposals allows staff more days >of annual holidays without reducing the number of hours worked per year below a fixed number. Other provisions for over- time premiums will benefit practi- cally all staff.\" The EEP recognises that pro- posals which mean more money will be held up until at least the second phase of the Government's w.ages freeze in 1967. The Federa- I tion said: \"We are negotiating for the future, long-term as. well as Simmediate. It may be that some provisions will have to be held up until the prices and wages freee I comes to an end.\" The unions are basically inter- ested in the proposals since they mean full recognition of white- collar trade unonism in the engi- neering industry. The six white-collar unions con- cerned are to consider the EEF proposals, and the two sides will meet again early in November. They described the proposed charter yesterday as \"far-reaching and , unprecedented.\" Union Frustration The backlog caused by the present unco-ordinated system- with many local variations-has caused frustration on the union side, too.

He will probably stay to advise Mr. Wilson daring the Commonwealth Conference which starts next week. Mr. MacDonald, who has been commuting between Nairobi and Lusaka, will be able to explain the reasons for President Kaunda's eleventh hour decision not to attend the Conference. At the Commonwealth Confer- once in Lagos last January. Mr. MacDonald played a major diplo- matic role byvirtue of the trust he enioys among the African leaders. Meanwhile. Mr. Wilson has been preparing the position he will de- fend-against heavy pressure-at the conference. Yesterday he called a meeting of eight Ministers which is understood to have discussed the Rhodesian crisis. The Ministers were Mr. Michael Stewart, Mr. James Callaghan, Mr. Richard Crossman, Mr. Bowden. Mr. George Thomson, Mr. Roy Mason, Lord Shackleton and Sir Elwyn Jones. he presence of two junior Ministers, Mr. Mason and Lord Shackleton, is probably explained by the absence from London of their seniors at the Board of Trade and the Defence Ministry. The leader of the Zambian delk- ation to the conference. Foreign inister Mr. Simon Kapwepwe, flew into London yesterday from copenhagen. Sir Albert Margal, Prime Minister of Sierra Leone. left no doubt at a London Press con- ference yesterday about the See Men and pressures facing Mr. Wilson at the conference. While making it clear that in his opinion the use of force to unseat the Smith regime was the only \"correct\" solution. he said mandatory sanctions would not merely be a \"good alternative\" solution but the \"only\" one. He himself would be prepared to take the initiative in proposing them. He also joined with President Kaunda in threatening to leave the Commonwealth \"if there are no satisfactory promises of action.\" The implication was that his conditions would be nothing lss than the adoption of mandatory sanctions-which would, of course, have to be extended to South Africa. if the Republic continued to help Rhodesia with oil and other supplies.

   "text_content" : "S. ,By GEOFFREY OWEN Union Carbide, one of the world's largest chemical com* panies, is trying to break into the British atlifreeze market with its Pre \"rand. This is a venture briolin with the sort of marktting problems of 0t*siness school professors. To stalrt thie obvtous, the usiie\"ss eonud -hardly be more sson. Piate mottorits will spend about Â£%m. on anti- free this winter, but it will all be spent within space of about eight weeks. - te dnewcomer to ketep hi salas poree em- ployed ri the rest of the year. Moreover the - 'exaiting, suppliers ar weU optreached and have peculiart marketing advantages which- the newcomer capnot match. The t leading brand, ltsecol. is mlade by Smoiths Industries, which as an important producer of motor components aid accessories has a special elationship with ca aniufacturers and dealrs. The big oil companies have their own birands which they are very happy to sell to motorists who do not ask for Bslecol (or some other brand) by .ame. Some 60 per cent. of sales are made through service stations, and a good deal of the \"do-it-your self\" market is in the hands of retailers like Boots, Wolworth and Timothy Whites, who sell their own private brands in their own stores. It is not easy for the newcomer to get adequate distribution for his product. Depressed Margins Why be in the business at all? Why isn't Union Carbide content to sell the raw material, ethylene glycol (which it makes at Fawley), for others to con- vert into a branded antifreeze? After all ICI, the largest ethylene glycol producer, has not yet tried to establish its own brand. (It is believed to be Bluecol's main supplier.) Carbide's thinking was that over-capacity had depressed margins on glycol and on bulk antifreeze to vry low levels, and that the only way to safe- guard its position as a supplier (and to extract the maximum amount of profit from each ton of glycso sold) was to move forward to the consumer and establish a branded line of its own., In the U.S. Prestone happens to be the best-selling brand of antifreeze, but, as many Ameri- can firms have discovered, products which sell well in the U.S are not always easy to market in Britain. Carbide has gone to great lengths to find out what the local motorist wants, and has adapted its marketing and advertising strategy accord- I ingly. I Naturally it wanted to offer Somefthing unique, and the Sopportunity was uncovered by a market research study which Sshowed\" that many motorists Sthought antifeeze was harmful Sto their car engines. Following I an approa ich hih is long accepted in the U.S. but new to I Britain, Carbide decided to mar- t ket Prestone on the basis of performance. Strobg emphasis Shas been put on the \" magnetic film \" contained in the product, which settles over all surfaces in the cooling system and is said Ito prevent existihn rust from cir. culating. A special point too. is that Prestone is suitable for use on modern engines with a high aluminium content. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t whereas other producers have a special grade for these engines; Rolls-Royce and Citroen have officially approved Prestone for use in their cars. With its test marketing last winter. Carbide succeeded in attracting the motorist's atten- tiao, but the distribution prob- lem was hard to crack. Carbide can get to the motor trade through wholesalers, and there is an important outlet in the motor accessory shops (often located in the main shopping street.which are not tied to any one producer. \"In America, where -70 per cent. of the motor- -'sts buy packaged antifreeze and put it in themselves icom- pared with around 50 per cent. in Britain). the supermarkets and discount stores handle a large bart of the business. A similar trend away from the ser- vice stations towards the High Street shops could develop here; this is how Boots has been able to capture about a quarter of the do-it-yourself market. But it will need vigorous and sustaied efforts by Carbide's salesmen to develop these new gutlet. Plans have now been made for a big attack this winter, and the aim is to secure what Mike Skelsey, assistant general manager of Carbide's Con- sumer Products Division, cautiously describes ai a \"significant share \" of the busi- ness. Skelsey himself, a 36-year-old Englishman, joined the company nine years ago as a chemist. After some years' experience in selling chemical products, he instigated a project to test the feasibility of a con- sumer marketing operation in Britain, and this ultimately led to the Prestone launch. But there was another pro- blem that had to be tackled at the start-what to do with the Prestone salesmen during the nonp-reezing months of the year. The answer was to market a range of car care products-- polishes, chrome cleaners and the like-which fitted naturally with the antifreeze operation. Here again Carbide had an existing range of products which it was marketing under the Prestone label in the U.S., and they could be adapted for use in Britain. These products, inci- dentally, incorporate chemicals made by Union Carbide (silicones in particular), but the primary reason for getting into the business is not to sell more chemicals, as it is in the anti- freeze case. The car care busaiess is another market with well- established suppliers, but the selling problems here are not quite so daunting. For one thinas the market is at an earlier stage of development: whereas 96 per cent. of motorists use antifreeze, a much smaller pro- ,ortion uses car care products. Thus the immediate opportunity for growth is more promising. Distribution, too, is easier. The oil companies have made' little effort to develop their own brands (in contrast to the situa. tion in the U.S.). and it is s- sible to secure distribution through service stations, acces- sory shops and other retail outlets. Carbide has devoted the same amount of attention, in product research and marketing effort, to its car care products as to antifreeze. It has pitched its marketing skills against an* other American product, Turtle Wax (marketed by Lloyd's Packing Warehouses). which in the space of four years has established a leading position in the liquid polish and the car wash markets. This was the first liquid polish and it has been very skilfully sold; there has somehow been a connection in the consumer's mind between the product and extract of turtle, though this is not specifically claimed. Striking Design Carbide's range was launched in the spring of 1965, and several modifications were made for the 1966 season. For the new Prestone Jet Wax liquid polish Carbide altered the for- mulation of the product (so that it could be applied more easily and quickly), changed the pric- ing structure (it is offered in a 7s 6d can instead of the larger 12s 6d can which had been introduced in the previous year) and improved the appearance. An industrial designer was brought in and he produced a striking design with a shiny red Ferrari giving lustre to the pro- duct, It is too early to say whether the Prestone operation has been successful. There is no question of a walk-over for arbide in either the antifreeze or the car care markets, since the existing suppliers are strong and there is always a chance of new entries. ICI, for instance, though it is not in the branded antifreeze market, does market a line of car care products through the Paints Division. It is always difficult for an industrial company to graft consumer marketing skills on to its traditional business. This is why many of the attempts by chemical companies to integrate forwards to the consumer have failed. In the U.S., in these two fields, Union Carbide has made the transition successfully. Its attempt to repeat the success in the European market has been backed by very thorough research and very careful analy- sis of local attitudes and local marketing conditions.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMANY STAFF The half-year statement trom Amalgamated Roadstone under- lines the effect of the seamen's strike and the interim dividend is lowered (see Lex page 1). But Alexander Duckbam strikes a bright note with a sharp spurt in profits and, also at the half- way level, Denco is doing well. Revenue reported by Scottish and Univeral is higher (see iex) but, as foreshadowed. Falks turns in lower profits. Edwards High Vacuum is hav- ing take-over talks (see Lex). Alex. Duckham Companies maintaining a vigorous growth image are becom- ing few and far between, but Alexander Duckbam is bne of the lucky few. At the half-year. pre- tax profits have more than doubled to Â£201,000 and the minimum esti- mate for the full year is Â£350,000 against Â£235,000-an increase of 49 per cent. The company's penetration of the motor oil market is the main reason for this perform- ance; sales of the major brand have more than doubled. Turn- over is now split evenly between motor and industrial oils, but the motor side is more profitable and is rapidly overtaking the other. Although the squeeze might affect industrial sales, motor oil should go on booming. In fact, the lower profit expected in the second half is due to the cost of stepping-up the marketing pro- gramme during the winter. Much attention has been paid to market- ing and its importance is bound to increase now that the Monopolies Commission has ended the tied garage system for oils. So far, the company has had no benefit from this change and the advantage of more outlets has let to be reflected in profits. Although the interim dividend is only maintained, there would be room for more and esti- mated cover is around 2.6 times for the same 13W' per cent. total. With the shares at 15s 9d, yield is only 4.3 per cent., but the prospective P/E ratio is very favourable at around 9 times. Falks A warning of lower profits was given by Falks with the interim dividend last February, so the de cline of some 9 per cent. to Â£687.000 in pre-tax, profits is no surprise. The group is closely aligned to the building industry-- it manufactures and distributes lighting and heating equipment for electricity, gas and kerosene. The setback, the first since 1959.60. arises not from a reduction in de- mand but from increased pressure on margins due to rising costs. The total dividend is maintained at 14Y per cent., covered Ifi times. The group will do well in the current.year if it can hold its sales and stop margins being eroded further. .Efforts are being kept up in .overseas markets, which pro- bably accounted for around one* sixth of total sales last year, and the fall in copper prices should help the cables side where new plant has been installed during the past year. Unchanged yesterday at 48s, the shares yield 6,2 per cent, and are selling 9.8 times earnings. Powty Group The Dowly Group report adds further substance to the statement made at the time of the preliminary figurqs (which showed pre-tax profits down 17% per cent.) regard. ing improved rospects for the current year. Ordes on hand are at record levels and a sustained attack on costs should restore profitability. which for share- holders in a company wit 60 per cent. of o business in aircraft com- ponent as comforting indeed. Dowty is, in fact. quite confident. A continung increase in sales is looked for, particuarly in fuel systems, whe there still seems Sexcellent \" scope for group equip- ment incorporated in the Rolls- Royce \" Dart \"engines. On the mining machinery side. representing about IS per ceht. of the business, progress is being made, and the industrial hydraulics division with a wider range of pro- ducts is looking for a better show- ing. In Canada the years of un- profitable trading are coming to an end and further good progress with oil seals has led to an increase of a third in factory space at the Ash- church works. What all this means for profits is reasonably clear; what it means for dividends is not. But on the whole Dowty still has room for manocuvre. and at 14s 6d yielding 6.2 per cent. the shares look reasonably valued. A.S. Stoddard Over the past two years A. F. Stoddard has experienced a sharp fall in profits. and the report does not suggest tht immediate recovery is in the offing. The brightest feature is that Glenvae-the tufted carpet subsidiary-has probably got over its teething troubles and should make a profit this year against a loss of Â£123.000. On a break-even basis, pre-tax profits might then' amount to around Â£3500000, compared with Â£225,000 last year, but the traditional side is rather doubtful. By far the largest part of the group's activi- ties. Axminster manufacture, regis- tered a 6 per cent. drop in turnover and narrower margins brought profits down by a quarter. Some price increases have been made, and the position should not deterio- rate if turnover can be maintained. With any luck the dividend is probably safe, although last year's earnings only narrowly cover the 121 per cent, rate-with help from capital allowances. Net indebted- ness is up from Â£118.000 to Â£394.000. but at least capital com- mitments are only Â£73.000. against Â£166.000. A nominal market, the \"A\" units yield 9,6 per cent. at 6s. Denco In his statement last April the chairman of Denco Holdings fore- cast improved profits; and certainly the interim report is cheerful enough with a pre-tax figure of Â£101.000 against Â£150.00 for the previous 12 months. Margins are currently running at 10.6 per cent. compared with 8.9 per cent. for the whole of 1965, while orders in hand are. up from Â£736,000 on January 1 last to Â£1.028m. The interim is.. per sent, as before. Depco's improved showing is largely the result of dive snficetion from its activities as .lubrication Sand hydraulic engineers. The aroup is no longer so reliant on the steel induistry and has spread its opera- tions into specialised industrial air conditioning, gas dr)ing and humidity control systems. Exports are growing steadily. On present form a pre-tax igure' of around' Â£225,000 could be forthcomini for 1966. which after a furi tax charge would give earnings of 32.2 per cent,, providing 2.1 times cover for, a maintained 15 per cent. dividend; Meanwhile. the St Ordinary-up 6d to 9s I .d on the day-yield 8 per cent. with a prospective P/E ratio S6s 5.8: 1",

Stoker. World trade is expanding year by year and the company is in good heart and equipped to meet the challenge of ever-increasing .- i L. ,-i... * -*-' competition,\" he declares. He points out, however, that as a direct result of the strike it has not been possible to reserve any amount for fleet replacement which is necessary each year. Despite increased cargo carryings. the trading surplus decreased from Â£356,386 to 26.304. Net profits were down from Â£457,729 to Â£337,830 and the dividend, as known, is effec- tively maintained at 10 per cent. Higher Expenses The fall in profit stemmed from a number of reasons-mainly increased operating expenses which were accen- tuated by the seamen's wage award in April. 16. the high initial cost of new ships, and the slow turn-around in UK. ports. Circumstances did not permit an equivalent increase in freight rates and furthermore when ships were held up additional tonnage had to be chartered in a market where charter 'rates were abnormally high.. Mr. Stoker reports that the Port of Man- chester rebate system on cargo pre- sented on pallets or in unitised form has had encouraging results. The losses incurred in the seamen's and also the longshoremen's strike in Canada are not reflected in the trading surplus but a provision of Â£210.000 has been credited to next year's account. Regarding the container service to Chicago venture, the chairman says that from the company's limited ex- perience in, that field the directors realise that much more careful study, research and experiment will be needed before a full appreciation can be gained of how to achieve the best results.

A number of subsidiaries continue to obtain a satisfactory volume of Sprofitable business but there has been little improvement\" in demand for steelworks plant and equipment and competition for major overseas orders remains intense. The' longer term outlook, however, includes a number of large steelwork developments which could \"materi- ally improve \" the prospects. And the group has taken every opportunity to diversify outside the steel industry special , attention being directed towards the utilisatibn of natural gas. The value of contracts completed during 1965-66 showed a slight in- crease and. although at the end of the year the volume of orders in hand bad dropped, it has currently im- proved again to reach the level of a year ago. Sir Peter states. Consolidated profit, before tax, in the year ended March 31, 1966. were Â£538.374 (Â£620.452) and the payment is held at 15 per cent, as stated July 30.

He went on to raise the question as to who should be responsible for the protection of the investing public, and declared: \"As few will welcome more Government con- trol, the City hould give'the sater swift consideration.\". Among difIculties in bringing cases of fraud to a successful conclusion were weaknesses of the Companies Act, 1948, penalties. under which should be much stiffer. To expedite matters in an emergency, the Board of Trade should haYv pre-inspector powers of inquiry-. Penalties for withholding informa- tion from SOT inspectors or destroy ing it must be \"realistic.\" a liason with foreg countries must be established 'without delay. Referring to the complexities of fraud cases Mr. Rice declared: \"The enormity of the crime is in. variably lost n the cobweb of un- inteluiglility.\" For fraud crime pre, vention, he urged that a panel be formed of City men who could, or the first indication of trouble, force the acceptance of a nominated execu- tive director who would have a good chance of- preventina further loss. For post-crime jurisdiction there should be a specialised financial crime judiciary sitting without a jury. SDuring discusion. which touched on various transactions, Mr. Rice made clear to shareholders that Svery goid reasona were put for- ward t the time to justify many of ; tho.tedi.t The neeting passed a resolution sking that \"the directors urge the authorities\" to take necessary action against those responsible for the com- any's l \"and take requisitesteps to etadite all those outside te Mr. Aice told members that had it not been fr the possibilities of Semph's comierclil trading there wouild fhar been itlet pointIn con- tinuh .

The few members present were greatly outnumbered by Press representatives. The meeting approved the accounts and confirmed compensation payments to former directors. At the meeting of Third Mile, of which Mr. J. D. Naylor is chairman, members adopted the report and accounts and re-elected the retiring directors. Bat they voted, aginst confirmation of payments made early in 1965 to retirin directors. Mr. Naylor earlier explained that if shareholders did not. approve the motion they would not become valid payments and presumably the cor. p.any would take steps to recoup them if they had been made.

Total orders for the month were.nerly Â£13.2m., some 2.8 per cent. above June, 1965. Within that total, home orders at nearly Â£10.8m. represented a 15 per cent. rise, but export orders fell almost 50 per cent. to nearly Â£2.4m The Ministry of Technology, m an official comment, declares that new home orders in June I showed signs of a halt in the downward trend.\" However, the Machine Tool Trades Association stressed that home orders in the second quarter were some 7 per cent, down on the first quarter and virtually the same as the corresponding three months of last year. Downward Trend \"It is hoped that the trend downward in ordering from the home market, revealed by these figures, and experienced by the industry in July and August, will not go unnoticed by the Govern- ment,\" states the association, \" and that steps will be taken, before depression develops out of the deflationary measures currently existing, to provide the climate which will encourage industry to invest in those items of high pro- duction which alone will allow it to compete effectively in the world's markets and restore the country's trade balances to a favourable level.\" Total home and overseas orders for the three months April to June stood at Â£36.9m., over 6 per cent. below the same three months a year ago and 4 per cent, lower than the preceding three months. This indicates that total orders con. tinue to move on an \"uneven plateau,\" as they have done since the fourth quarter of 1964- a 'I C C ,L apparently rising towards the end of eachquarter. rdrs outstanding at the end of June were worth just over Â£107m, which was 11 per cent. above the figue at the same time a year ago and representing a little undqr nine months' deliveries on hand. But this improvement from the ointof view of work on hand re- flets in part the fact that total de- liveries although increased, have not maintained their excess over orders coming in. The total orders received in the first six months of 1966 were 6 per cent. below those for the same period a year ago. Home orders comprised about Â£gSm. of the Â£75.5m. worth of business received and they were I per cent. higher. Export orders, on the other hand, dropped 22 per cent. to just over Â£17.4m. Total deliveries in the same January to June period were Â£72.6m,, an improvement of only 2 per cent. Export orders on hand at the end of June, at Â£29.5m, represent nearly 11 months' deliveries.",

   "text_content" : "Flnancial Times Reporter Local authorities have now been given details of how Government Departments are to revise contracts prices to meet contractors' increased costs arising from the selective employment tax. A Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular issued yesterday enlarges on earlier statements of principle and recom- mends authorities to deal with applications for price revisions in the same way as the Government Departments. The circular covers contracts signed on or before May 3 when the tax was announced and which continue after September 5 when it comes into force. No revision is being allowed where the tax is refunded or a premium is paid. On contracts for specific projects which cannot be terminated before completion without damages (mainly construction contracts), an extra payment will be made amounting to 90 per cent. of the contractors tax payments for directly employed and sub-con- tracted industrial workers on site. No reimbursements will be made for site agents, non-working fore- men, office staff, etc. In addition, any delays in com- pletion of the contract for which contractors are responsible will be excluded from the period qualify- ing for reimbursement. Extra payments on term contracts or contracts for services which can be terminated at relatively short notice will be allowed up to 100 per cent. of the tax. \"Every attempt will. however, be made to settle for less than 100 per cent. where this is possible, and De- partments will not hesitate to termi- nate an existing contract and to go out to tender again if it seems likely that by doing so they could secure a lower price tha the original contract price plus 100 per cent. of the corres ponding selective employment tax costs\" states the circular.

   "text_content" : "The 41st annual meeting will be held in Johannesburg on 26th Sep- tember, 1966. The following is the review by the chairman, MR. B. E. HERSOV, which has been circulated with the report and accountt for te yearended 30th June. 1966:- The overall surplus of R291.000 earned during the year under review reflet.s a dereas of R69,000 compared wfth the previous year. This was due to a reduced surplus from mining operations of R271.000 (1965-R339,000) caused by a decline of 0.172 dwt to 4.857 dwt per ton in recovery grade. With net capital expenditure amounting to R 75.000 it was necessary to reduce the dividend from 3c to 2%c per share, absorb- ing R 18.000. For the current year expenditure on capital account is estimated at R200,000 to be spent mainly on shaft sinking, pumping equipment prospecting and plant improvements. Facilitie for the hoisting of men and material have been provided at Fortuna, which has become a section of the Agnes mine and supplied 7.453 tons of ore to the reduction plant during the year. A power line to provide Escom power at Fortuna is being con- structed. Following the results of pros- pecting, Mount Morgan has be- come a section of the Agnes mine and it is anticipated that this se- tion will supply about 500 tons of ore per month to the Agnes plant. Ore Reserves The total ore reserves at the operating mines at the end of the year under review were 437,400 (1965-414,000) tons. There were small decreases in tonnage at Sheba a~d \"Agnes, but at New Consort tonnage increased by 32,600 tons to 182,200. The value of the ore reserve at Agnes was virtually un- changed; at New Consort the value Mining Operatio New Comort Sheba 1966 1965 1966 1965 Tons milled ... 76.200 76.500 65.100 62.700 Aecumulatcd slinme retreated-ton, .... 100.400 89.900 - Yield--dwt per ton treated ....... . 4.016 4.227 7.581 g8078 Working comt nor ton treated .. ....

The Prince Con- sort shaft was sunk 137 feet to a position corresponding to 47 level. Installation of reef and waste bins. required for hoisting of rock from 45 level, is almost complete and a reef pass system from 42 to 45 level is being excavated. Capital expenditure included extensions to the reduction plant and equipment to regrind and retreat calcined con- centrates and as from August 1966 an additional 3,000 tons of accu- mulated slime will be treated per month. Development values on the lower levels of the Prince Consort shaft continue to be encouraging. Of 2.560 feet sampled in this area, 39.8 per cent was payable at 4,047 inch-dwt and the ore reserves on these levels increased by approxi- mately 54,000 tons. At the adjoin. ing Clutha mine, from which 9.557 tons of ore were transported to the New Consort reduction plant for treatment, development results were disappointing, only 2.9 per cent. of the footage sampled being payable. Sheba Mine In the Zwartkopje section en- couraging values have been encountered below 24 level and the overall development payability, excluding Royal Sheba section, was 14,7 per cent at an average value of 2.186 inch-dwt. Reclamation from old areas was continued and over 19 per cent of the tonn te milled was obtained from this source., Exploratory development at Royal Sheba totalled 710 feet dur ing the year but none of the 50S feet sampled could be claified as payable. Ore drawn for milling from the Royal Sheba section totalled 2,.56 tons, mainly from development. Agns Mine Sinking of the Cesoa sub-vertical shaft continued and the shaft has reached a poiltion 53 feet below 25 level. Development accom. plished, excluding that advanced in the Golden Hill and Mount Morgan areas, totalled 9.229 feet. Of 7,810 feet sampled. 189 per cent, was payable at 822 Inch-dwt. decreased by 0.22 dwt per ton while at Sheba there was an increase of 0.56 dwt per ton. The overall effect was to increase the average value of the reserve by 0.23 dwt to 9.99 dwt per ton. Prospectgs Prospecting of dormant mines continued at a reduced rate during the year under review and R45,000 was spent on these operations. The Great Scott prospect was de- watered but the values obtained do not warrant further exploratory work at prerent and operations have been suspended. At the Golden Hill, a further 194 feet of exploratory development was ac- complished during the early part of the year but, as only 3.6 per cent of the development sampled was payable, it was decided to suspend operations. Detailed sur- face mapping of your company's mineral-rights was continued during the year. It is estimated that ap- proximately R18.000 will be spent on prospecting during the current year. Noanmining The entire yield from your com- pany's plantations at Mamre con- tinues to be sold to a sawmilling company under a long term con- tract. Profit from forestry opera- tions during the year amounted to R6,000. Farming operations at Moodies Bstates reflect an improved posi- tion with profits of Rll.000 (1965 -R1,000). Although tobacco and maize are being grown and cattle ranched, citrus remains our prin- cipal crop and the future prospects of the farm will depend to a large extent on the citrus export market. Net capital expenditure at the forestry and farming sections totalled R2,000. General In the face of generally rising costs the increaed tonnage treatcd enabled the mines' average work- ing cost per ton to be maintained at slightly below the 1965 level. However, Improved benefits granted to both Buropean and Bantu employees during the year under review will reflect more fully durina the current inancial year. The Mogamblque authorities have introduced a contract levy on Portuguese nationals, which will also have an adverse effect on working costs I should like to ~ cord your board's apprelaton of the services rendered by the general manager, Mr, Oeni the managers of our various branche and their staffs as well as by the staffs at both the head and London ofles of the company.",

Costing 1m., they will be operated on British Rail's new container service between Pareston Qay (Jarwich) and Zeebrugge. Each ship will carry 148 30-sect long high-capacity con- taners, with the internationally-agreed cross section of eight feet by eight feet Of the total, 110 will be stacked, mostly three.high, in the cellular holds and the remaining 38 will be carried on the hatch covers. Alternatively, containers 20feet or 40-feet long, can be stowed on the batch covers. The container ship differs in design from the normal freight vessel in that the whole of the cargo space is taken up by sec tionalised holds containing cellular compartments. . Instead of a cargo of assorted shapes, weights and sizes, the payload consists of con- tainers of standard dimensions which \"slot\" into their individual cells. Quick Turn-round By bulking the cargo into unit loads in this way, the loading and discharging operations can be fully mechanised. The British Rail ships, for example, will turn round in port in five hours and will be able to make one round trip between Harwich and Zebrugge each day. Although a direct comparison is diflicult. British Rail estimates that the turn.round time in port of a con- ventional cargo ship of about the same size, would be \"several times as long.\" The ship-to be powered by Mirrees National diesel engines giving a sed of 131 knots and equipped with a bow thrust unit and bow rudder-will be 3881-feet long. They are expected to be delivered fn time for theZecbrue service to start operating early in 1968. The aim of the container service is to give the customer a complete door-to-door freight system at one \"through\" price, with a built-in uarantee so reliability and regu. ry, says Britsh Rail. \"The lower unit costs inherent in the system will enable cheap rates to be offered. 75 mph Rail Service When the service is introduced it will be fully integrated with rail and road transport in the U.K. and in Europe. in Britain the rail service will be operated by Freightliner-type bogie flat wagons, each capable of crrying two 30.set containers at speeds of up to 75 mph. These will maintain a shuttle service between Parkeston Quay and an inland rail terminal to be built at Stratford, London, It is expected that large companies, container leasing companies and for- warding agents will provide their own containers, built to international standards. But British Rail, as a start, will build 750 30-feet containers as a nucleus. Discussions have already begun with forwarding agents about the development of the new service. A I _ series of conferences is being arranged to which the various trading interests will be invited: one with the road transport undertakings has already been held. Â£8m. Scheme The container-ship service is part of an Â£8m. scheme, announced in May, to redevelop Parkeston Quay to meet Britain's expanding freight and tourist trade with Europe. The port is to be modernised with up-to-date passenger and freight handling facilities. The Harwich- Hook of Holland passenger service will be operated by two roll-on, roll- off passenger and vehicle ferries, aug- mented by passenger ships in peak seasons. The existing freight and pas- senger links by other shping ines from Parkeston Quay to sbjerg and Bremerhaven will be maintained and another roll-on, roll-off service is due to begin next year.",

   "text_content" : "THERE IS NOT much doubt that the hottest maiden race for two- yearolds that has taken place so far this season was the Convivial Stakes run over six furlongs on the last day of the York Ebor meet- ing. The winner was Prince Piper. trained by P. Prendergast in Ireland, who got home a head from Montesano, with Bosw4rth Field 1 % lengths away third, just in front of Rougeway and St. Pauli Girl, who, in her previous race, had run Pia to half a length in the Chery Hinton Stakes at Newmarket. St. Paull Girl runs at York again this afternoon in the Tadcaster Maiden Stakes (2.30), and unless there is an exceptionally smart newcomer in the field she ought to win this time. Another two-year-old who showed promise at the York Ebor meeting is Palladio, a bay colt by the French Derby winner, Phillus f out of a mare by Precipitation. Although apparently unfancied, he showed up well behind Royal Palace in the Acomb Stakes and, judged on breeding, he will be well suited by the mile of the Sanctum Maiden Stakes (5.0). In the Bishopsthorpe Nursery Handicap (3.30) I like the plok of Panama, who has run well in each of his last two races and who, though he is by the sprinter, Set Fair, is likely to have derived sufficient stamina from his dam, Chanfrin, a daughter of the 1945 St. Leger winner, Chamossaire, to ensure his staying seven furlongs. Mahbub Aly, a useful per- former when there is some give in the ground, is likely to concede 7 lbs syuessfully to Vaux-Le- Vicomte in the Heslington Stakes (3.0); and Herbaceous, an imposing colt by Crepello, out of the Persian Gulf mare, Perian Lilac, may be too ood for Promonsory in the Crathorne Stakes (4.0). The best bet on the card at Lingield this afternoon may be Fontex in the Purley Stakes (4.30). This Italian-bred colt was attempt- ing to give Camus and Zaraway 19 lbs and 13 Ibs respectively when finishing third to them in a handi- cap at Yarmouth on August 20, and, not surprisingly, the task was beyond him. He. is favoured by the conditions of this race.

The previous biggest single day's rise was 5.9 on September 13, 1965. While it is true that the largest gains occurred in the leaders, because of the bear posi- tion in them, the rally became much more general and as many as 29 per vent of all F.T.-quoted stocks rose while only 8 per cent. fell; on Tuesday, only 6 per cent. rose while 34 per cent. fell. The maet .was encouraged to a firm openin by the overnight resistance of Wall Street and at 10.30 a.m. the index was 2.5 up. Owing to a period of hesitancy, this was ex- tended only to 2.8 at noon. In the afternoon, the upward trend became much more marked and at 2.45 p.m.. the index was 4.1 up. Closing prices were almost at the best of the day, with the early rise in Wall Street contributing to the firmness in the late dealings. Professional bear closing was an important factor in the strength of the leaders. Over equities as a whole, the buying appeared to be small but persistent and mainly on public account, with a leavening of small institutional orders and inquiries. Many jobbers described the advances as quite out of pro- portion to the amount of stock changing hands. They also spoke of the day's business as quiet, and this tended to be confirmed by the markings of 7,936 as against Tuesday's 9180; on Wednesday of last week, the total was 7,891. Funds Improve Quiet coditons persisted in the rFuis n:maket but. after displaying renewed uncertainty at the opening, prices improved fractionally in places on the absence of further selling and the appearance of small buyers. -Help. ing sentiment was the firmer trend in sterling ahead of tomorrow's ex- pected announcement of the August gold reserve figures. SThere was a fair twway business in Corporation loans, although prices generally showed little alteration.

   "text_content" : "Il ur Main Editor The full details of the Consoli- dated Gold Fields rights offer to sharebeolders, first detailed in THe FINANCIAL TIEs on August 16, outlines the various purposes for hich the Â£5.5m. of new money is needed and also confirms the news in our mining column of August 22 that the group intends to \"go public\" in Australia throuh an issue of shares for cash in its principal wholly-owned subsidiary there, Consolidated Gold Fields (Australia) Pty. As regards the funds from the London issue, Â£ m. is needed to make the first repayment early in 1967 of the Â£5m, orrowed for the Mount Goldsworthy iron ore project which has alredy started shipments under its Â£57m apanese contract. Another loan of Â£1.Um. due for repayment shortly, was for the purpose of build- ing up the group's interest in M nt LyUl to 60 per cent. Another Â£0.m. has been needed to follow up the group's stake in its principal Canadian- offshoot New. cose Holdings. A further S2.2m. (Â£0.73m.) will also be required for this purpose. It will be found from a 5-year Canadian bank loan. The cost to Gold Fields of talkii u rights in the recent issue by Kloof o was around Â£1.75m. Finally, it is expected that some Â£.7Sm. of the new Gold Fields money will arise in South Africa. This will be used to reduce loans ncurred for the financing of industrial interests there. All these requirements total Â£5.m. and the proceeds of the rights offer (one for 12 at 100s) together with bank facilities should, it is considered, make suffcient working capital avail- able.' As previously stated, dividends for the year to last June are expected to total Ss 6& which is Is less than for 1964-65 although, thanks to corpora- tion tax, the cost will be Â£3.7m. against Â£2.58m. It is also hoped to maintain the 196667 payment at this level on the highe capital. Gold Fields are 0lts IOd ex rights. The new shares are 3s 14d premium. TRONOH IN THE CHARTER CAMP From an earnings viewpoint the 1965 annual report of Tronoh Mins, the Far Eastern tin complex, has already been superseded by the current year's half-time statement which was detailed and commented on here on July 28. But the annual, the first issued since the Anglo American CorpTrtion group came into the Tronoh picture, offers an opportunity to have another look at prospects. . In the first place the issued capital is now Â£2,578,946 in 10.1,7S shares as the result of the Anglo American company concerned Lon- don's Charter Consolldated, having Output Up Tro Sune idor section Troo' 1 production has been going strongly with a seven-month total of 884* tons of concentrates against 579 on in the sme peod of1963. T lower pric will however, have been taking some of the gilt off the gigerbread. And, so far a reholders are concerned, so will the impact of corporation tax. Even so, Tronoh has officially ex. pressed the hope that it may be able to sustain last year's Is 6d distribu. lion on the hi capital The latest pgidance on this point will come with Mr. 0. W. Simms' annual statement to be ssued in advance of the meetng which is on September 23. It s notable in the annual report that the expansion of Tronoh's ture tin resources oes on apace with the potential addition of a least another 69m. cbic yr of lo* ade round. And prospecting is still proceeding. The ba n Charter should be a su nt guantee of all the finance that may be needed. On August 22 Tronoh's investments had a market value of just over Â£5m., equal to 9s 9d per share. ETC'S COSTS MAY INCREASE In the year to June 30 E n5am Tr aal Consodated of the Amlgo. Vail group made less money from its gold mines in the Barberton district of the Transvaal, mainly owing to lower grade the chairman Mr. B. B. Hersov says in his annual statement. Despite South Africas dose of in- flation, costs were contained thanks to increased tona treated. But in the current year Improved benes granted to employees will reflected more. fully and the introduction by the Mocambiue authorities of a con tract levy on Portuguese nationals will also tend to push up working costs. Expenditure on capital account for 1966.67 is estimated at around Â£19000. In the past year the net profit was Â£I1,i000; the 5 per cent. dividend on the 5s shares absorbed Â£54,000 and Â£87,500 was allocated for capital expenditure. The shares are 2a 71d to yield 9.5 per cent. MINING BRIEFS WEsTEN MINING-Four weeks to Ausust 23: Central .Noriman treated 14.215 tons for 7.734 oa gold.

   "text_content" : "by B. A. YOUNG I won't pretend that I was able to follow every detail of the com- plicated plot of the play which Terence Kelly and Campbell Singer have made of Mr. Kelly's novel The Carib Sands. It concerns an elaborate swindle in which a cunning American financial shark, most excellently played by Ron Randell. moves in on what was to be a modest hotel project in Jamaica and. cleans up a fortune for himself and his absentee part- nor at the expense of the other shareholders. the builder, the architect and indeed everyone else involved. The details of the transaction are in fact lucidly presented at all times, and anyone who was not quite so stupid about \"business\" as I am will probably have no difficulty in taking it all in. There is a sudden last-minute reversal of fortune at the end, the nature of which I must not reveal, and I suspect that this should have been rather more carefully prepared. Not that it is anything but con- sistent; it just seems to me a little inartistic. I shall be mocked in some circles, no doubt, for suggesting that art has anything to do with a play like this, which is pure straightforward entertainment with- out a hint of a message. But entertainment is like mathematics; it comes either pure or applied, and both branches have their func- tions. No one is going to come out of the Cambridge feeling, as Judith Malina put it, that they must go and break a window. For all the unpleasantness of the business- men who make up most of its cast. the play is not an attack on capi- talism, or indeed on anything else It is designed to provide the kind of breath-holdg excitment the ordinary man or woman ts on a rolleroaster. or at a football match, or listening to Beethoven's 7 Symhony. And it prvides it generously and intelligently. Harold French has had to cope with stage that generally has hal a-dozen or so characters yellingat one another on it, and his drec tion keeps the tension fully exerted the whole eveting. He is helped by an able cast that includes Michael Culver as a loyal young architect, Alan Gifford as a decent American businessman, Larry Cross as rough but honest American businessman and Jessie Matthews as the rich Englishwoman whose caprice to have a small Colonial- style hotel built for sentimental reasons started the whole thing. Miss Matthews, I am sorry to say, is not well cast and sometimes gives her lines an artificial sound not discernible in the other parts. When she said \" Kindly desist! \" I thought nostalgically of George Robey. She is the only lady in the play, apart from a beautiful secretary, played by Margaret Roberston, who gets one of the hardest slaps I ever saw in the theatre when she nearly torpedoes the whole crooked undertaking. She is clearly intended to bring a tiny whiff of romance into the piece, but there isn't-unfortunately- enough of her to do so. Never mind; the play is quite compelling enough without that.",

   "text_content" : "The management of the Criterion was adamant about not letting the Press in until their third perform- ance, on Tuesday, when it hap- pened that thrde other manage- ments in London were opening, and one in Edinburgh. So I must beg their forgiveness for having bought a ticket for the opening night of Ben Bagley's The Decline and Fall of the Entire World as Seen through the Eyes of Cole Porter: it was that or nothing. The show consists of 29 of Cole Porter's less-known, or even unknown, songs, strung together with a minimum of presentation- just enough in the way of choreo- graphy and continuity, plus some pretty slides by Shirley Kaplan rather noisily projected on the backcloth, to see the songs through. Russell Brockbank, the Punch a:tist, once remarked to me that the only result of collecting one's drawings in a book was to show how few ideas one had. Too much of Cole Porter's vaunted sophistica- tion consisted of assembling Roget- like lists of OK names or objects; and performing so many of his songs one after another like this emphasises their weaknesses rather than their strengths. Only those with an enthusiasm for the master's work equal to Mr. Bagley's will find the evening free of longueurs. But at least they can enjoy the sight, and sound, of above-average musical numbers being put across with point (even if occasionally a blunt point) and audibility by five artists without a microphone among them. Appro- priate cheers for Joan Heal, Rod McLennan, Barbara Evans, Travis Hudson and Bill Oddie, in that order. B. A. Young.",

   "text_content" : "Wieland Wagner has long been associated with the Stuttgart com- pany, and it was they who intro- duced his work to London in 1955 (Fidello) and to Edinburgh three years later (Tristan). His new pro- duction of Lulu next week, with Anja Silja, promises to be the moste interesting operatic event of the festival. Lohengrin, which opened on Tuesday, was not well enough sung to be very welcome. In essentials this is a simpler version of the famous Bayreuth staging. There, the chorus stands six deep on the tiered ramps which semi-circle the stage; here, four deep-a device which geti a chorus of 80 on to the small stage without strain. We have already seen this simpler form of the pro- duction at Sadler's Wells, during the. Hamburg visit (and for that matter Covent Garden's Lohengrin is a blunt copy after Bayreuth), An unhappy feature particular to the Stuttgart version is that Lohenbrin first appears Jacked up through a manhole; at the end Gottfried pops up the same way, and Lohengrin (after handing him the sword, horn and ring-for \" Kommt er dann helm\" l1 cut) takes the lift down again. Wieland sacrifices the detail and historical picturcsquenesa on which his grandfather set such store. No distinction is made between Braban. tines and Saxons, between court and commoners. The chorus, identically dressed in costumes which the King's Theatre close-up does not flatter, move symmetri- cally; nun-like, the women hold crosses, while Ortrud clutches some kind of pagan totem. The Meyer- beer elements disappear in a ritual presentation of an archetypal drama about faith, and the conflict of light and darkness. The bold outlines of the performance are clearly Wieland Wagner's, but an \"acting producer\" was listed on the programme, presumably equiva. lent to Covent Garden's \" rehearsed by ., \"; and the details bore little evidence of Wieland's personal stamp, The individual performances lacked strength and cogency, Pour of the same Wagnerian principals were those Stuttgart brought to London in 1955, and to Edinburgh in 1958: Grace Hoff. man, Wlndgasaen, Neldlinger. Otto von Rohr. Time has dealt most lightly with Neldlinger; his tone has always been rather coarse; his phrasing has always been power. ful strnnaly charategrised, and he was an impressive enough Telra- mund. Miss Hoffman is reliable, less than electric; it was disappoint, ing not to hear Astrid Varnay's thrilling Ortrud, as originally promised us: alone, she might have made this Lohengrin worth while. Windgassen seemed tired and old, hardly able to get through the title. role, though he rallied for some passages of the third act. Von Rohr, as Heinrich, thinned out on high notes and wobbled on low ones. The soprano was Hildegard Hillebrecht, curious choice for a heroine who needs above all clear, full, pure tone and true intonation. She had contrived a vaguely poached appearance to suggest Elsa's dreamy rapture (can Mr. Solti really think this the voice and personality for the Empress in Die Frau?), and her singing had a similar vagueness. The general mischording in ensembles was often intolerable. The chorus were less than precise. Ferdinand Leitner did some nice things (for instance, a broad, warm string line As the women leave after the Act 2 duet). but as Stuttgart's Generalmusik. direktor he must take the blame for what was, musically, a down. at-heel. shabby performance.",

   "text_content" : "(Anthony Crickmay There is a world of difference between taking up an old scenario to create a new ballet with a theme, a heart and a soul, and merely using an old score and story for an extended exercise in pastiche; between, in effect, La fille mal gardde or The Two Pigeons, masterpieces both And, ... . ack Carter's Beatrix, Festival Ballet's new creation, which had its premitre last night. La olie fille de Gand was a Grisi ballet of 1842, a year after Giselle, with choreography by Albert and music by Adam. It contained, by all accounts, many atractive dances and some heavy dramatic stuff. Carter has stripped and simplified the scenario, and scrapped all the intricacies of character-development. To take one example: for the big dramatic climax of Act 2 we no longer have the scene where Beatrix's old father, sister, and faithful lover reveal themselves, at the ball where our heroine is now a glittering courtesan; nor, on the other hand. does Carter make anything signi- cant of his alternative, the entrance of the lover alone. Compare this with Fritz's thrilling arrival at the Venetian party of Der ferne Klang: ScnreKers opera has many John Glpin and Dianne Richar parallels with Beatrix (perhaps he also knew Victorine, its source). Characterisation, dramatic or choreographic, is nonixistent. There are no deeper levels, such as underpin even the slightest enter- tainments which are also works of art. Potentially interesting situa- tions are not explored. It is all rather odd from a company which boasts Norman McDowell as Artistic Adviser, and from the creator of Agrionia. For choreo- graphically Beatrix is the merest pastiche, and quite insignificant. It flows. The invention, though shal- low, keeps moving, and has its pleasant moments. The divertisse- ments would serve if there were stronger main action to set them off. But, one feels, why bother (Anthony Cricknay with it at all-unless to perpetuate Festival Ballet's image as a pur- veyor of ballets for people who cannot take real ballet. Joseph Horovitz has scored Adam's tinkling music in thicker colours than suits it. The Bardon- Walker decor is in their familiar chocolate-box style, pantomime stock in conception but far more beautifully proportioned and painted. (One understands well the complaint that the current vogue for this team has set British theatre- design back by fifty years.) Within their abilities the large company set to work with a will. Dianne Richards is the heroine, and John Gilpin gives his familiar perform- ance, in the role of the noble seducer.",

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON The Albert Hall was full last night for the second of the three concerts Pierre Boulez is giving with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. No doubt Beethoven and Barenboim had something to do with that. Nevertheless the crowds came and were rewarded not only with an admirably played and highly interesting interpretation of the G major Piano Concerto but with Debussy's Nocturnes, Webern's Six Pieces and Stravin- sky's Rite of Spring. To these per- formances the\" same words of praise apply, though they were less interestng (but no less intensely enjoyable) to the degree that their excellence was more easy to fore- see. What was so remarkable about Barenboim's playing and Boulez's accompanying of the Beethoven was that the gentleness and lyrical radiance were stripped of the blan- ket of routine respect that clings to all but the very finest Beethoven performances. The music was seen freshly and seen whole; behind the unusual delicacy and softness of touch (in orchestra as well as piano) there was blood and bone. In a sense it was Mozartian, but again it looked forward to Men- delssohn, Schumann and Chopin. All this, paradoxically, because the essence of Beethoven was so clearly perceived. One of the pleasures of hearing Boulez conduct this orchestra is the blend he draws from them of ex. treme alertness and happy relaxa. lion, The whole spectrum of the tone seems to alter. To put it crudely, one realises how unmusical merely average performances are. The Debussy Nocturnes were ravishing not only as pure sound but as sense. Because (the paradox again) the essence of each piece was so subtly and yet precisely captured there appeared to be much more relationship than usual between the three. And nobody who heard Sirenes done with such tenderness and flow of changing timbres (the voice parts beautifully sung by the BBC Women's Chorus) could ever consider it unworthy of the other two. The Six Pieces of Webern were given in the original version of 1910, which uses a huge orchestra to make some tiny, mysterious but uncannily rare and momentous sounds, and some loud and terrify. ing ones as well. It was extraordi. nary to hear the eleven whispered bars of the third piece compelling the rapt attention of the great audience. The hall was In one of its benign moods; hardly a murmur was lost and the shattering climax of the funeral march developed a splendid resonance. After this. the Stravinsky might conceivably have sounded tired, but it was as musical, as vivid and as coherent as everything else.

Southport. The Australian Kel Nagle took 68 strokes and at present leads the 164-strong field by two shots. His compatriot Peter Thomson, who has won two of his live British Open Championships here, finished in five hours, with 70, to share second place with Bob Charles. the New Zealand left-hander, Peter Butler, from Birmingham and Hedley Muscroft. the Moor Aller- ton Leeds assistant. A veritable gaggle assembled behind them on both 71 and 72, and Billy Casper, the American Open champion, was one of a large group with 73. But yesterday's round, played in the dreaded threesomes that were largely abandoned in Britain as un- workable some time ago. but still find favour in America, quickly became a test of mental and physi- cal stamina. The last trio to play yesterday took over 5% hours to complete 18 holes, and Commander Richard Fell, tournament secretary of the British P.G.A., will to-day order all players to speed things up. Several British competitors, not- ably Neil Coles (71) and Christy O'Connor (73), threw away chances in their last fateful hour by allowing their concentration to slip away. Both were out In 34 and I started back well but both a* l opped two shot& oI the last Such a situation was ideal fort Nagle's equable te ramen and he was not disturbed by the slow play. s Out in par 35, e earned his first birdie at the 10th hole with a 10-foot putt. but a immedi- ately lost that advantage by miss- ins the green at the short 12th, t and taking four from a horrible .

He wedged to 15 feet at the immensely long 15th. and holed the putt for another birdie I four, At the 510 yards 17th he was short again, but chipped into the hole from 45 feet for an eagle ' three, and made another birdie at the last with a drive and superb ] two iron to the green 513 yards away. SButler, playing immediately in front of Nagle, was also out in 35, and also ran into trouble at the devilishly difficult short 12th where the tiny green presents an almost imposble target in a cross wind. Butler intended to send his four iron shot into the right-to-left Sbreeze, but hit it too low and was Splugged in the face of a bunker. He could only hack the ball down into it, but saved himself from disaster by holing out bravely from Sfour yards for a four. Another serene and self-confident golfer, Butler promptly produced four successive birdies from the I; I . r., I: IÂ·Â· L: I . 5 I a a . t a D t b a a i, a e it i, r 5 s r. a a a It d e SBob Charles was out in 3f, too, Sbut then took seven at the 10th, Swhere he hooked a driv into bushes. Forgetting the British rule to play a provisional ball, he took a thrash at it, moved it but six Sinches and was then forced to deem it unplayable. Eventually he holed. Sout from five yards for his seven a -a noble face-saving effort. t In 1963, when he won the British Sopen at Royal Lytham, Charles Sputted like a demon. Now he did a so again, holing from 25 feet for San eagle three at the 13th, from S40 feet for a two at the next, and t from 12 feet at the 16th to redeem b himself. s Thomson made birdies at the fourth and fifth holes with putts Sos 30 feet and five to be out in 33. i, But as he grew tired of waiting- e he has always been a golfer who, e likes to get on with it-he hit ~ it bad drive at the 16th. and dropped I. a shot, and another at the nex r which gave him no chance of a Sbirdie. A 12-foot putt earned him s one at the last, but by then he had r. let slip his chance. a Casper played with the simple a grace we expect of such a great n golfer, but found judgment of second shots difficult, because the it wind had changed since his lone d practice round.

   "text_content" : "Everything suggests that the all- Midland final at Lord's on Satur. day will be a very close affair. In a normal county match Worcester are clearly the better side because they have balance, but in a single innings, limited overs contest there is very little to choose, and I would certainly not like to have a bet on the outcome, which could very well hinge on the toss. Out of curiosity I asked the members of the Essex side which they fancied, and they were almost equally divided. Personally, I lean a little towards Worcester, because of Tom Graveney and Basil D'Oliveira, and because Jack Flavell is potentially the most dangerous bowler on either side, should there be anything in the wicket Warwickshire, under the expert guidance of Mike Smith, have achieved their success in this com- petition by what has come to be regarded as standard tactics, and which certainly won the title on two occasions for Sussex. They rely on five accurate seam bowlers, supported by lively and usually defensively positioned fieldsmen, to dismiss their opponents, or, alterna- tively, to restrict them to a reason- able total within the allotted span of overs. Their own batting is strong, and contains an unusually high percentage of stroke players who can score quickly. In par- ticular Bob Barber. Mike Smith. Dennis Amiss, and John Jameson are all capable of playing the type of innings which if they bat first, could result in them reaching a total of 220 or over. The chances of a team making more than that batting second against the Warwick attack and field placements are not very good. On the other hand, I am decidedly suspicious of the Warwick batting if they had to chase a formidable score, as, apart from Mike Smith, they are somewhat lacking in ex- perience. Worcester, like Yorkshire, who won the Cup last year, have not allowed themselves to become as earn-minded as many sides. They will include two spinners, Norman Gifford and Martin Horton, in their line-up so that if the pitch should take turn, their chances of success are greatly increased. Their only concession to the demands of this particular competition will, I expect, be the inclusion of pace bowler Brian Brain, for either Richardson or Hedley. This move will weaken the batting, and pos- sibly even more important, the close-to-the-wicket catching. Other- wise Don Kenyon will rely on the side that is giving Yorkshire such a close run in the County cham- pionship, and which I feel they would certainly have won, but for Test match commitments. The Worcester batting is formidable even if they omit one of their batsmen. In Tom Graveney and Basil D'Oliveira, they possess two players of true international class, as was made abundantly clear to me during a magnificent partnership of over 200 against an admittedly weakened Essex side. Tom's inn- ings was a masterful exposition of the art of batsmanship on a good wicket, and I think that he is prob- ably a better player now, and cer- tainly safer than he was in his later 20s and early 30s. His bat is nearly always perfectly straight and throughout his lengthy stay at the crease we seldom managed to get the ball past him. Like so many great players, he scores a majority of his runs in an are be- tween cover and mid-wicket, and employs straight ltat, as distinct from cross-bat strokes unless the delivery is very bad. If Warwick- shire take first strike and reach a good total Tom is such a crafts- man that despite the pressure of the occasion he could bat them home. Basil D'Oliveira is a rather more spectacular player who also has a sound defence. Consequently he is the ideal person to retrieve an indifferent start or hammer a wilting attack. Alan Ormrod is unques- tionably one of the most promising of the younger brigade with a pleasing style which clearly shows the influence of Graveney, while Martin Horton has a most impres- sive record in Cup matches and has frequently demonstrated that an opening batsman in this compe- tition is at his most valuable if he is able to build an innings at a reasonable, rather than at a break- neck, pace. The team which has a good start can, with wickets in hand. plunder the best bowling to a quite astonishing degree in the last 15 to 20 overs,",
