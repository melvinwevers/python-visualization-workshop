THURSDAY Evening. Few developments of outstanding interest were reported in Money market circles to-day, where condi- tions were described as quiet. Al- though the matter had been regarded with an open mind, Lombard Street was disappointed at the absence of change in the Bank Rate. In the foreign exchanges official rates were unaltered except that for the Ar- gentine peso. A fair amount of business was reported, as well as in gold. The weekly return of the Bank of England revealed a decrease of Â£6,976,744 in the active note circulation to Â£546,498,187, while bankers' balances figured at the respectable total of Â£107,898,931. Despite the absence of a reduction in the Bank Rate, discounts continued on the easy side but without any material altera- tion in rates. The clearing banks, for instance, adhered to their buying rates of October, November and December maturi- ties, these being 3 per cent., 3% per cent. and 3% per cent. respectively. The \"hot\" Treasury bill was said to have changed hands down to 3% per cent. Leading houses held to 3% per cent. as their buying rate for three months' bank drafts except for the finest quality paper. Credit was again in plentiful supply, borrowers still being able to satisfy their needs at down to 2Y per cent. in outside quarters. Applications for the Â£600,000 Northern Ireland three months' bills amounted to Â£5,025,000. All the available bills were allotted at an average rate of discount of about 3'/; per cent. ___ LoAYO DioSuor t.I uT. PER CET..

Peso Firmer As indicated above, very few changes were made in the foreign exchange market. Of the official rates only that for the Argentine peso was moved, the quotation again being adverse to sterling at 17.00. The U.S. dollar was still quoted at $4.03 and the Canadian dollar at $4.45. In the \"free\" market, Italian lira closed at 76% after touching extremes of 75% and 77, while Norwegian kroner eased to 21%.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 21st Sept. European news had little effect on Stock Market sentiment, but there was a certain amount of buying coincidently with reports in Wall Street that, while recurrent waves of uncertainty must be expected, repeal by Congress of the arms export embargo is assured. The final list was mostly fractions to $1 higher, with a few stocks $2 to $4 up. Turnover totalled 1,730,000 shares-410,000 fewer than yesterday. Business was only moderately active at the beginning, as many operators held off pending developments. The market, in consequence, was dull during the morn- ing, with price movements narrow and irregularly lower. At midday a rather easy trend was shown by Steels, Rails and Minings, but Utilities and Rail Equip- ments kept firm. In the early afternoon the whole market rose on short covering and new buying, but trading subsequently turned listless and prices went slightly below their best. At this juncture a long list of stocks was fractions to a point higher, with gains in Farm Implements extending to 2 points. Steels were aided by further increases in the activity of steel mills. Support was also given to Aircrafts, Motors and Oils. Rails were firm following the mid-October week's estimate of freight loadings indicating a new high for two years, reflecting the increased industrial activity. Quotations fluctuated in restricted limits in late trading, when bullish enthusiasm cooled off pending President Roosevelt's Message to Congress. The closing tone was firm. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing aver- age rose 1.23 to 153.48, Rails 0.38 to 32.83 and Utilities 0.23 to 24.65. Of 865 stocks dealt in, 489 improved, 191 declined and 185 were unchanged. The majority of operators look for a period of consolidation and after that a broad upturn based on the bright domestic business prospects. Further, it is believed that the Roosevelt amendment to the Neutrality Act will receive enough votes to repeal the arms export ban. In the Bond market, losses in U.S. Gov- ernments reached a point. More Federal Reserve banks withdrew their support, thus allowing Federal issues to find their own level and facilitating Treasury and corporate financing. Railroad bonds were irregular. Turnover in bonds totalled $15,470,000, against $13,420,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931 = 100) was 171.3, against 171.1 yesterday.

   "text_content" : "As was anticipated the postponed 7th September Account went through yes- terday quite smoothly, although not without a lot of hard labour for depleted staffs. Early dealings were cheered by the news of the rising in what was Czecho- Slovakia. Leading Industrials and Oils were in quite good demand at improv- ing prices. However, the tone became dampened when just before noon it became known that the faint hope of a reduction in Bank Rate had again been disappointed. Monetary Policy It is increasingly felt that no prac- tical investment programme can be formulated until Sir John Simon has opened his War Budget next Wednes- day. If, as many people believe, he will then reaffirm the Government's long-standing \"cheap mo.-ey\" policy, it is suggested that a cut in Bank Rate might well come just after the Budget. Such a change at a well-chosen moment would doubtless prove very helpful to the Government's war borrowing plans. Meantime a good deal of money is going temporarily into Treasury bills. In the gilt-edged market there was again hardly anything doing yesterday outside of small swaps. Conversion Four and a-Halfs It was alleged that the past two days' special markings in Conversion Four and a-Halfs at as high as 102 were contra-purchases to jobbers' acceptance of small lots of War Loan at the mini- mum of 881. The buyer was assumed to be willing to pay 1- over the minimum for Conversion Four and a-Halfs, be- cause he thus obtained a more readily negotiable security. The stock is at the latest redeemable at par on 1st July, 1944, and at present carries four months' interest. Sovereigns For Sale As was emphasised here on Wednes- day it is an order, and not merely a request, that \"all private holdings of gold coin or bullion .... must be offered to the Government through your bank.\" It was added when the Treasury notice was issued, on 4th September: \"The Government will pay for them in ster- ling at the prevailing rate.\" Several City people have since told .me that they have had sovereigns for sale, but have experienced great diffi- culty in finding a buyer at the right price. The average branch bank seems as yet blissfully ignorant of the Treasury order. FromnJalarJop 9t A member of the R.A.. writes me that even the Bank of England has apparently not made any provision to encourage dishoarding of gold so much needed by the Exchange Fund. After being sent from one official to another some half-a-dozen times this correspondent was finally told by the Clerk-in-Charge of the Bullion Depart- ment that the latter \" could not do any- thing.\" Instead he was advised to go to a bullion broker. Rather indignantly my correspondent concludes: \"As I had already wasted a lot of time, I did nothing further. Is that the way to arrange for the public to surrender its gold ? \" In point of fact any bullion broker whose name you can find in the Post Office Directory will give you 39s 3d per full-weight sovereign, less A per Â£100 commission, with a minimum charge of Is per parcel. May I again suggest that arrangements should be made for any post 'office to accept odd lots of sovereigns at, say, 38s 9d each. g ht Otarisl",

   "text_content" : "The Board of Trade has now advised the insurance companies and Lloyd's under- writers that in administering the Govern- ment's Commodity War Risk Insurance Scheme they may give the assured an \"adjustable \" policy based on the weekly average maximum amount of stock at risk over a period of three months, or, alter- natively, may issue policies for periods of one month instead of insisting upon the full three months cover. Both these new arrangements are con- cessions devised to meet the criticisms levelled at the scheme, but while they are palliatives they are not remedies for the fundamental disability of the scheme, which is that the initial premium of 10s per cent. per month for a period of three months is an overwhelming burden on commerce. The weekly average system ensures that the assured does not pay more than the proper premium for the amount at risk, but the market practice where adjustable policies are concerned is to take a monthly average of the maximum amount at risk. The Government's plan involves a good deal more clerical work and, possibly, a higher premium than would be payable if the monthly average system were adopted.",

   "text_content" : "THURSDAY Evening. Despite some disappointment at the absence of a reduction in Bank Rate, Stock Markets made further progress to-day towards consolidating the im- provement previously established. Business failed to expand, but many quotations were harder. Completion of the Settlement with- out any appreciable hitch was a favourable factor. Mr. Chamber- lain's war review on the previous day was considered encouraging, and some dealers drew comfort from the reports of the rising in Czecho-Slovakia. The number of bargains recorded in all markets was 2,233, compared with 2,176 yesterday. Dealers in gilt-edged stocks were not greatly disappointed at the maintenance of Bank Rate at 4 per cent. The present deadlock, due to the lack of buyers at fixed minimum prices, is accepted pending steps to clear up the position. Meanwhile, changes from one stock to another, consisting mostly of transfers from War Loan and Conversion 3% per cents, to Conversion 4% per cents., con- tinued. Concessions by buyers of the latter were suggested by special mark- ings up to 102, or 1% above the minimum. Among Dominion issues, Canadian 4 per cent. 1940-60 were most active, with trans- actions recorded from the minimum of 98 up to 98%. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 BELGIAN BONDS WEAK The Foreign Bond market continued to be one of the most neglected sections of the Stock Exchange. With buying interest almost non-existent the few movements of the day were produced by scattered selling in which deals were only possible below previous levels. Belgian 4 per cent. 1936 suffered the heaviest fall of the day and closed 3 points down at 62. Elsewhere, Brazilian issues met with some forced offering. The 5 per cent. Funding issue lost 2 points to 12 and the 5 per cent. Funding 1914 bond also dropped 1 point to 11%. The 4 per cent. Rescission and the 4 per cent. 1910 descriptions were each quoted % lower at 5. Austrian bonds were also marked down, but few bargains were reported. Far Eastern issues passed a quiet day. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 HOME RAILS SUPPORTED The Home Railway market again showed a somewhat brighter appearance and the small balance of buying orders which made its appearance yesterday con- tinued. The pressure on the minimum prices for prior charges thus declined and liquidation became less difficult. Ordinary stocks showed some further small re- coveries and several quotations were fractionally higher at the close. Thus Great Western added % a point and closed at 23% buyers, paying around 24% for delivery- Southe1r6. per cent. Preferred Ordinary gained a full point to 50 and the Deferred Ordinary put on % to 9%. On the other hand, interest in the Foreign Rail market abated. The Argen- tine rail traffics affected sentiment favour- ably, but few buying orders for the stock were forthcoming. Central Argentine were the only Ordinary stock to move and made a small improvement of % to 7%. Cordoba Central 3% per cent. met with slight support and were finally quoted 1 point higher at 56. In the American section business was hampered by presence of a large volume of stock awaiting delivery and the number of bargains was small. Nevertheless, a number of prices were adjusted upwards. Chesapeake and Ohio closed at 49%, $2% higher than previously, and Baltimore and Ohio were quoted at 9 as compared with 8 previously. New York Central, in which dealings continued to be reasonably free, were sold on balance and eased % to 23%. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS IMPROVE Less Selling and Inquiry for Leading Shares As regards Industrials, the leading shares displayed a firmer trend, partly due to the Czech news and to the main- tenance of dividends by several important companies. The absence of forced selling also proved a favourable factor. More inquiry was reported for the popular shares, and although the business passing was light, some sharp improvements took place among Brewery and Tobacco shares. The upward movement halted as an expression of disappointment at the absence of change in the Bank Rate and a few shares tailed off from top. Declines as a rule were not serious and were the result of small sales on an unwilling market. Changes on balance were irregular, but a number of further minor improvements were shown. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 84.8, compared with 83.8. BANKING shares had a steady appear- ance and a few Home issues fimshed firmer, with Barclays \" B\" at 54s and Barclays (D.C. and O.) Preference at 31s 6d each Is 6d higher. Barclays (D.C. and 0.) Ordinary were Is lower at 35s 6d. Bank of Scotland shares were still nominally 50s on the dividend cut. Standard of South Africa were % easier at 9%. INSURANCE shares were firmer in places. Rallies of % each occurred in Commercial Unions and Royals. Sun Life were better. On the other hand, -Pru- dential \"A\" were easier at 20% and the \" B \" 2s 6d down at 50s. Business was extremely quiet in ELECTRIC POWER issues. Beyond a rise of 9d to 17s 3d in Perak River Powers, quotations were unaltered. Bargains were done in County of London Electrics from 27s 6d to 29s 3d. The turnover in ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT issues was small and few changes were shown. Crompton Parkinsons rallied Is 6d to 13s 6d and G.E.C. were favoured up to 60s 6d. Scattered small sales weakened the undertone of the MOToR group. Morris continued on offer and were 9d lower at 22s 6d. Tillings were 9d down at 31s 9d to deter further sales. Rolls-Royce, Leylands and Standards eased. On top of yesterday's rally, Hawker Siddeley Aircrafts were in request and left off 9d higher at 11s 3d. Faireys hardened anew to 15s 3d, but Bristols yielded 6d to 14s 6d and the Preference Is 3d to 17s 6d. Among COMrPONETs, Dunlops improved to 24s 6d and Triplex Glass were dealt in from 28s 9d to 246 10%d. SHIPPIG descriptions were uncertain. After their reaction, P. and 0. Deferred and Fumes Withy were a few pence better. Calsn dropped Is to 5s and Cunards were sellers at4s. COMMUNICA- TIONS were dull with Cable and Wireless Funding stock 2 points lower. Gains and falls were pretty evenly divided in the STEEL section. Outstanding movements were a rise of Is 3d in Wear- dale Steel Deferred and a fall of Is 3d in Swan Hunters. Firmness was shown by United Steels, Cammell Lairds and Consetts. B.S.A. changed at 23s 6d. John Browns and Vickers were realised and a few small sales of Stantons and Stewarts and Lloyds took place. Buyers came for Imperial Chemicals, and after 27s 3d the shares were 27s, against 26s 9d. Limited inquiry caused Murex to firm up %' to 3%. Turner and Newalls again were offered and changed down to 68s ld, but finished at 70s. Electric and Musical rallied to 7s 6d. TEXTILES remained dull, with J. and P. Coats no better than 23s 9d. In contrast, RAYONS presented a few bright spots, the overnight news of an increase in viscose prices in America favourably affecting the popular shares. British Celanese Ordinary and Second Preference were each 3d firmer, while American Celanese hardened % to 6%. Courtaulds went ahead to 26s 9d and finished at 26s 6d with a gain of 9d. In STORES, Marks and Spencer \"A\" strengthened I to 2%, while Woolworths attracted up to 53s 1id, but finished around 51s 6d again. Great Universals and John Barkers were Y easier. William Whiteleys realised 7s 6d only. Further recovery occurred in the BREWERY group. Guinness gained 3s 9d to 78s 9d and Bass 2s 6d to 95s. Taylor Walkers gained 2s to 22s. Ansells, Watney Deferred and Courages were about Is higher. Distillers were in demand and changed at 85s, closing at 84s 6d with a net gain of 3s. Leading TOBACcOS were inquired for. Carreras \" A \" advanced Y' to 5% and the \"B\" 9d to 13s. Imperials gained Ys to 5% and British-American Va to 4Y. A small business was done in American Industrials and Bethlehems were 111 (after 112), U.S. Steels 92%, Nickels 53, General Motors 65 and Chryslers 105. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS DULL Little interest was taken in Rubber shares. The commodity promised nothing in the nature of a lead, the price remaiing at 9%d during Stock Exchange hours. In- quiries for the shares were few, and seldom led to business, with the result that quotations shaded off. Among the leading descriptions Allied Sumatra were purchased in a small way and hardened from 15s 10%d to 16s. Elsewhere Emerald were offered and lost Is 3d, closing at 16s 3d, and Gula Kalum- pong were sold and also shed Is 3d to the same figure. F.M.S. Planters left off sl down at 15s, while Batu Caves fell from 15s to 13s 9d. Among the lower-priced shares, Layang announced a dividend of 3 against 4 per cent, but the quotation held its ground at 10%id. Rubber shares in Mincing Lane con- tinued dull, with business very slack. Anglo-Dutch finished at 25s 6d, Allied Sumatra 15s 9d and London Asiatic 3s 3d. Quotations in the Tea share market on the Stock Exchange were steady despite lack of business. Nuwara Eliya further improved from 32s 6d to 33s. O-ering of Ceylon and Indian Planters caused a drop in the price of Is 3d to 18s 9d. Rubber and Tea Prices Page 4 GOOD OIL FEATURES Buying of Oil shares gathered strength to-day and, with a relatively good turn- over, the market presented a number of firm features. Trinidad and South American issues were particularly favoured, buyers appar ently showing preference for shares in companies considered to be well removed from any scene of hostilities. Lobitos were supported, the company's fields being in Peru, and the shares moved up %, to 1\"!',. Trinidad Leaseholds put on %s to 4',2 and Trinidad Petroleum Developments Is 3d to 52s. Shells finished Y, to the good at 4%, after having been bid at that price for most of the day, and Royal Dutch were % higher at 40%. Mexican Eagles hardened a few pence to 5s 3d, while Canadians remained at 8s 9d. Kerns followed yesterday's im provement with a further rise of 12d to 4s 6d. Anglo-Ecuadorians were 6d better at 19s 6d. Oil Share Prices Page 4 RISES IN KAFFIRS West Wits. and Western Reefs Up-Other Mines Steady Small buyers of Kaffirs came into the ascendant to-day. The volume of selling showed further contraction. In addition, the demand found little cheap stock avail able on jobbers' books. The improved tone seemingly made holders of shares bought higher up not anxious to sell, and prices consequently responded. Gains on the day largely predominated. The non-producers in particular were helped by a private cable received from Johannesburg. This offered the possibility that the Union Government may give some assistance, financial and otherwise, to enable developing mines to reach the pro- duction stage. The cable also expressed a hope of existing producers adopting a grade-raising policy. West Wits. gained % to 2%, rather buyers, Venterspost %' to 1%, Libanon 9d to 7s 3d and Western Reefs %s to A. Western Holdings advanced Is to 8s 9d, as did Palms. to 4s 6d and Marievale to 14s 6d. West Rand Trust rose 9d to 4s 6d. Of the producers, West Springs at i'%. and West Rand Cons. at 1% each improved '. Numerous other rises of %V to %V were scored. In the Finance group, Anglo American rallied %, further to 1%. West Africans were quiet, but harder here and there chiefly in sympathy with Kaffirs. Ashanti rallied % to 3%. on the food reef value in the lowest level detailed Fere this morning. Amalgamated Banket hardened 3d to 6s. West Australians, with Lake View and star au lower at i/s va, were oareiy sceaay despite the fact that higher equivalent prices ruled for these issues in the Com- monwealth. Technical difficulties stood in the way of evening up quotations by arbi- trage transactions. Rhodesian Coppers were neglected. The only quotable alteration was a gain of 3d to 16s 3d in Rhodesian Selection. Char- tered advanced similarly to 19s 3d. Of other Coppers, Rio Tinto rose Y to 11%. Tin shares kept steady, the few changes being of a mixed character. Tronoh dropped %1 to 1, Pahang 3d to 16s 3d and Petaling 3d to 18s 9d, but Siamese added %6 to 1/. Among Lead-Zincs the Barriers were cabled as firm from Australia, but were a quiet market in London. The only change in the Diamond group was a rise of dd In Cons. of S.W. Africa Preference to 5s 6d.

   "text_content" : "TRINIDAD OILS The Stock Exchange end-September Settlement passed off as it was expected to do; that is to say, without the dis- closure of any difficulties. As we were mentioning a fortnight ago, the pessimists then pointed to the possibilities that open in connection with the next Settlement Day, 12th October. But, as every Stock Exchange man knows, the more talk there is of possible trouble, the less likely is any trouble to materialise. The Rising in Czecho Developments in Czecho are having a heartening influence upon Stock Ex- change markets. They led to a better tendency which became reflected in such shares, for instance, as Guinness and Distillers; in a few Aircraft descrip- tions; in two or three insurance com- panies' shares; and in the South African Mining market. The fact of Bank Rate being left at 4 per cent. aroused little comment. Gilt-edged stocks remain difficult to realise. The Imperial Chemical interim dividend gave cause for satisfaction to those who thought that possibly the company might consider it prudent to postpone payment of a dividend at the moment. Industrials were inclined to be a little better. The week winds up on a more cheer- ful note than that which prevailed at the opening, when news of the Russian invasion of Poland and the sinking of the Courageous combined to cause de- pression. Good Oil Shares \"What to buy in the Oil market?\" we asked a week ago, answering the question with Trinidad Leaseholds, 88s 6d, Trinidad Petroleum, 50s, Shells, 91s 3d. Leaseholds are now 92s 6d, Trinidad Petroleum 52s 6d, Shells 90s 72d. In sympathy with the Trinidad rises, the shares in Lobitos, whose property is situated in Peru, have also improved. On the rise in Trinidad Petroleums, British Controlled Prefer- ence deserve to stand higher than their present price of 4s 9d, because British Controlled holds a large line of T.P.D. Brewery Debentures Examples were given here yesterday of debenture stocks in electricity supply companies which, by reason of their being in short supply at the moment, should be worth selling while the going is good, the prices now offered being relatively high. In certain other markets, similar conditions apply. For example, Ansell Brewery Four and a-Half per Cent. Irredeemable debenture can be sold at 99; while, on the other hand, Hiram Walker Four and a-Half per Cent. Re- deemable debenture can be bought at 88. At the same price, Cornbrook Four and a-Half per Cent. Redeemable de- benture is available. Both the stocks on offer are well protected as to interest and capital. Were it not that Ansell debenture, ex- ceptionally, happens to be in demand, the price, it is pretty safe to conclude, would not stand as high as it does. Another Anomaly Distillers Six per Cent. Preference can be sold at 23s 6d, at which the yield is Â£5 2s 2d per cent. Booth's Dis- tilleries (controlled by Distillers) Five per Cent. Preference are on offer at 17s 6d, yielding Â£5 14s 3d per cent. Divi- dend dates are about the same. The anomaly and its inference are alike obvious. AutolgrU",

   "text_content" : "There is always an ominous ring about a second Budget in a given financial year, and the nation knows that the one to be introduced next Wednesday will add to the already heavy tax burdens. The question of financing the war resolves itself -in the main into a division between taxa- tion and borrowing, but before con- sidering the place to be given to taxation, one fundamental principle must be laid down. That is the need for economy. The urgency of helping on the war, and of maintaining an efficient defence in this country, must not be made the excuse for profligate expenditure. The aim must be to obtain value for money, and the Gov- ernment, as shown by the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer yes- terday, is beginning to devote more attention to the extravagances which have called forth complaint. Given the assurance that the spending of the money will be carefully controlled, the British taxpayer will face the prospect of higher levies the more willingly. Revenue certainly must be the first line of defence in the financial side of the war, if only to avoid piling up a larger mountain of debt than is essen- tial. The tax weapon, however, is not one to be used indiscriminately, and its application is complicated at the present time by the unprecedented up- heaval which the war has wrought in the national life. The evacuation of certain areas has caused a big dis- turbance to business and in many directions there has been a substantial loss of income. The present is a tran- sition stage, between the ebb of peace-time pursuits and the full tide of war activities. The Chancellor's new tax proposals should be so framed as to interfere as little as may be with the speeding-up of business under the new conditions while securing a maxi- mum return for the Exchequer. Obvi- ously luxuries must expect to be first brought into the net, with a view to directing private spending into the most appropriate channels as well as to obtaining revenue. It will be desirable to avoid action likely to bring into play the law of diminishing returns, but the emerg- ency expenditure of the Government will be expected to do more than counteract the effect of diminished civilian spending in advancing the country toward a state of full employ- ment and overcoming the retarding effect of disturbance. With a general tariff already in existence, there is less scope for adventure in the taxa- tion of imports. Some may have to bear additional duties, but one thing the Chancellor assuredly will keep in mind will be the need to do nothing which will hamper our export indus- tries. The larger the amount of that trade, the greater will be our ability to pay for essential supplies. There is an obvious temptation to experiment with forms of taxation new to this country-capital levies and the like are already being advocated in some quarters. Any innovation will need to be approached most carefully. Sir John Simon will need no reminder that budgetary proposals could have a most adverse effect upon the credit of the country. That credit must be kept high. Upon its maintenance will de- pend the prospects of the Government as a borrower and the level of prices, minimum or otherwise, at which gilt- edged securities can be dealt in freely. The country looks with every confi- dence to the Chancellor to keep these considerations to the fore.",

This famous iron and steel business was made public at the beginning of 1938, and although in that year 8.9 per cent. was earned on the then Ordi- nary capital no dividend was paid. The object was to conserve resources at a time when the company was involved in the ambitious and progressive pro- ject of installing the latest type of hot and cold mills. Finally, early this year the capital was reconstructed and hearly trebled, a Â£2,000,000 First Mortgage debenture was created, and the company went into alliance with the United Steel and Bankers Indus- trial Development companies. At the last meeting Mr. R. F. Summers expressed confidence that the new \"A\" shares would be as attrac- tive an investment as the old Seven and a-Half per Cent. Cumulative Pre- ference from which they had been converted. The present distribution supports that optimism. The \"B\" shares are entitled to one-third of the \"A\" dividend until the latter have re- ceived 7& per cent. Thereafter both participate equally in the available profits. The \"A\" shares, upon which it seems likely that the full 74 per cent. will be paid, stand around 16s 6d, and the dividends thereon will repre- sent an important source of income to United Steel Companies.",

   "text_content" : "A sharp downturn in the profits of J. Hepworth and Son, the big whole- sale and retail manufacturing clothiers of Leeds, points to the contraction of trade which was already foreshadowed at the close of the previous financial year. The drop of Â£20,100 to Â£66,100 in net profit represents a fall of 28 per cent., and takes the total to the lowest figure since 1932. The dividend of 5 per cent., which is paid for the fifth suc- cessive year, is covered with a small margin. The balance forward is reduced by Â£1,500 to Â£32,200, after transferring the usual Â£3,000 to employees' benevo- lent fund. Nothing is carried to reserve this time, against Â£15,000, and this fund remains at Â£200,000. A reduction of Â£59,500 to Â£393,900 iin stocks illustrates the smaller trade movement, but book debts and loans have risen by just under Â£10,000 tc Â£80,300. On the other hand, creditors are nearly Â£10,000 more at Â£169,200",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Advices from New York to London yesterday indicated that the recent spasm of weakness of sterling in that centre had ended. Expectation grows that, once the panicky holders of ster- ling balances have scuttled out, \" black \" market rates will approach nearer to the official rate here. No official request has been made that British importers and exporters should invoice in foreign currencies. However, financing of international trade in currencies other than sterling may increase. Obvious but- ! Invoicing in foreign currencies is an obvious step to prevent \"free\" ster- ling being offered abroad. Such a departure from normal prac- tice would have far-reaching results and many financial and business in- terests are opposed to it. To help the authorities, it was suggested in the foreign exchange market on the first day the new regulations came into force. If, eventually, an official ruling in favour of such invoicing is given it will be necessary for some guarantee of forward exchange rates to be forth- coming. Notes Returning An encouraging feature of yester- day's Bank Return was the reflux of almost Â£7,000,000 of notes from active circulation. This, while only about 15 per cent. of the previous outflow, indi- cates that demands for currency were based upon actual needs created by the emergency and not for hoarding. A larger permanent total of notes must continue in circulation, but it is generally expected that the existing Â£546,000,000 will be further reduced in coming weeks. The credit base is more than maintained. Inquiries among leading banks yielded not the slightest confirmation of reports that banks are deliberately restricting advances or calling in loans. Care is certainly taken in granting new advances because the business involved might contravene regulations.

In re- affirming his belief that the fusion will prove of great benefit to Stewarts and Lloyds, the Chairman, Mr. A. C. Macdiarmid, observed that his view had not been affected by the war. The present state of emergency, however, does preclude any forecast of results. The first eight months of this year had produced considerably better figures than for the corresponding period of last year. The policy of the company has a twofold object. While all resources, potentialities and skill will be held at the disposal of the Government for the successful prosecution of the war, the Board will do its utmost to preserve the fabric of the company so that when peace comes the undertaking may emerge strong in resources and ready and able to deal with the c6ndi- tions which will then arise. The Chairman added that the combination with Stanton will place the company in a stronger position to carry out that policy.",

The company was incorporated in 1936, and a substantial increase in capital was made early in 1938 in connection with the acquisition of new businesses. Good progress has been made in the short period since formation, and con- solidated net earnings of the group were Â£48,900 for the past financial year to May, against Â£46,600 for the preced- ing period. Owing to the different dates of acquisitions certain profits have been retained by subsidiaries in each year, but net profits come out at Â£31,400, against Â£17,100, which was struck after allowing Â£6,600 written off investments as the proportion of divi- dends received prior to completion of purchase. Reduction of the Ordinary dividend to 5 per cent., against 10 per cent. in each of the two previous years, is ex- plained by war. In normal times the repetition of previous payments would have been justified. The sum distri- buted bears a larger proportion to earn- ings, as the increased capital now ranks for dividend, which requires, less tax, Â£10,900, against Â£13,200.",

As the report showed, the fall in profits was largely due to the reduced receipts from the coking subsidiary, whose earnings were affected by the slump in the price of and demand for coke. Production was consequently reduced, and, as the Hon. Robert James mentioned at yes- terday's meeting, the manufacturing cost ratio rose. Further, the company was deprived of revenue which would have been earned from gas and other by-products had the ovens been run to capacity. Another adverse factor was the series of mining difficulties at the Barrow colliery, but these are being overcome. Production is improving and before long it should reach and pass previous figures. Operations at the Barnsley Main colliery were by contrast very satisfactory. The recent purchase of the adjoining Monk Bretton colliery will prove a valuable addition.",

Correspondents kindly note that this oiler does not apsily to our contributor \"Aitolycus \" or \" The Diarist. Postal address : 72, Coleman-street, R.C.2. Teleurams : \" Pinntinlo, Ave., London.\" A. H.-\" The Diarist \" writes: The head office of your own bank ought to be prepared to sell the gold coins for you at the current sterling value, less A per cent. commission (minimum Is). Dealers in gold include Messrs. F. Caludet, 23, Gloucester-way, E.C.1, and Messrs. Samuel Montagu and Co., bullion brokers, 114, Old Broad-street, E.C.2. Anxious, Tetbury-1. No. 2. We see no reason to advise you to sell securities of the kind. 3. These are quoted 9d-ls 3d. We should say that they are unsaleable. Blackamoor-Both are purely sterling issues and registration is not necessary. B. W. G.-For the time being we would leave the money where it is. Both the securities named have minimum prices which are given daily in our list of closing quotations. Day-We think all the securities named are likely to be realisable to better advantage later on and would not sell any of them at the present time. G. J.-If you are holding dollar securities they must be registered. The terms on which such stocks will be acquired have not yet been disclosed. H. A. S.-It is still intended to publish the list, but this is, of course, subject to the prices coming to hand and to the avail- ability of space. The last prices received were as follows: Mentakab .44, Jelobu .75 and Hong Fatt .80. R. H.-Both are excellent. On the whole, we should be inclined to select the Bank shares. Tweedside-Your holdings are in sound con- cerns and although the market in several of them has become very nominal we con- sider that they should be held. In time better prices should be obtainable. We should advise you to exercise patience and hold on. Twyford---It is a sound concern and we see no reason to doubt that it will be able to fulfil its obligations. We should say that your best course is to take no action until nearer the time when the money is likely to be required. Ubique--Nos. 1 and 2 are sound investments and should be retained. The others, al- though more speculative, possess hopeful rospects and we do not think they should e sold at the present time. Wolfram--Dealings suspended pending fixing of maximum prices by Government. Meta used in manufacture of high-speed tool steels. Xozzo-The nominal value of the stock is Â£100.

   "text_content" : "Plans are well advanced for ensuring that Great Britain secures ample supplies of specialised manufactures hitherto im- ported from Germany. These goods comprise chiefly machine tools, chemicals, electrical appliances and scientific instruments. Arrangements may be divided into three categories:- Schemes for manufacturing such products in the United Kingdom. Survey of alternative sources of supply from friendly countries. Proposals for limiting the use of materials for commer- cial purposes or replacing them by British products. Examples of goods replaceable by British manufactures are machine tools and dyestuffs. The efficiency of certain types of German machine tools-lathes, for instance-is admittedly high. But in practically every case a British product can be made to do V.1 ..... i, WL\", W UÂ£iL. Though some commercial dyes may prove irreplaceable this should handi- cap the textile industry only to the extent of limiting the range of colours used. Non-essential industry will have to tighten its belt, just as food con- sumers are to be rationed. Compared with 1914 the present position has been improved by the pro- tectionist tariff policy pursued after 1931. A justification of this policy is that it has encouraged many indus- tries of strategic importance. DEVELOPING INDUSTRY Comparison With 1914 There are now far fewer products that cannot be made in the United Kingdom. A corollary is that there is less opportunity for developing new industries as, for ex- ample, the dyestuffs and zinc smelting trades were developed in the last war. There is no question of replacing all German products by British. Already purchasing commissions are at work in the United States and other countries whence supplies of machinery, photographic and optical instruments are normally drawn, as well as from Germany. A principal pro- blem is to determine what materials are lacking, bearing in mind the shift of de- mand from a peace-time to a war-time basis. Imports from Germany during the first seven months of the year comprised the following (by value):- Photographic plates ... Â£43,800 Optical instruments ... 357,000 Other scientific ......... 314,900 Electrical goods ...... 383,200 Machinery ........... 3,138,800 Chemicals ............. 2,542.300 Only in isolated instances can goods com- prised in these totals not be replaced. Where not replaceable their strategic value is strictly limited. Farsighted planning has seen to this."

   "text_content" : "BUSINESS LEADERS By our POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WESTMINSTER, Thursday. The formation of a Supply Council com- prising leaders of industry and finance was announced by Mr. L. Burgin, Minister of Supply, when he reviewed the work of his Department in the House of Commons to-night in relation to war needs. He dis- closed that since the outbreak of war orders for further supplies had been placed by the Department costing Â£70,000,000. Mr. Burgin said that he would be chairman of the Council and Sir Arthur Brown deputy-chairman. The other members would be:- Director-General of Munitions Produc- tion, Sir Harold Brown; Director-General of Explosives, Lord Weir (chairman, G. and J. Weir); Director-General of Tanks and Trans- port, Mr. Peter Bennett (president, Federation of British Industries). Director-General of Equipment and Stores, LordWoolton (chairman, Lewis's); Chairman of Committee of Control, Sir Andrew Duncan (chairman, British Iron and Steel Federation); Director-General of Finance, Mr. P. Ashley-Cooper (governor of Hudson's Bay Company and a director of the Bank of England). Lord Woolton, Lord Weir, Sir Andrew Duncan, Mr. Peter Bennett and Mr. Ashley-Cooper had asked to serve without remuneration. The effect of the war so far upon in- dustry was disclosed by Mr. Burgin, who said that some 9,000 concerns and 6,500 sub-contractors were already working directly for the Ministry, while so far as shell production went 68 undertakings were engaged over and above those normally making munitions and 700 were producing components as well as shells. BUDGET NEXT WEEK The Prime Minister announced 'n the House to-night that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his War Budget on Wednesday next. The Budget resolutions will be debated on Thursday. Sir John Simon, asked if he would take steps to ascertain the present value of the capital owned by individuals liable to income-tax, said his emergency Budget should be awaited. As to afy assurance that taxation of the growth of capital during the war would receive careful con- sideration, he said the original answer showed the matter was under review. There was a general expectation in the Lobby to-night that the Budget will deal with the country's financial problems in a bold way. An increase in direct taxation is regarded as inevitable. The opinion was held that with income- tax at the rate of 5s 6d in the Â£ at the beginning of the war, any increase may be expected to be moderate in order that the national resources can be conserved for a greater effort later on.

   "text_content" : "CREDIT BASE HIGHER The most interesting feature of the Bank of England return for the week to ast Wednesday, issued yesterday, is the reflux of Â£6,976,744 of notes from active circulation. This is the first contraction n the demand for currency for a month, and it reduces the circulation to Â£546,498,187. As a result of this and a small increase n gold and silver, the Banking Depart- ment reserve is greater by just over Â£7,000,000 at Â£34,227,918. Although total deposit liabilities are Â£6.9 millions more, he ratio is 3.5 per cent. higher at 20.2 per cent. There was virtually no attempt to offset he expansionary effect of the currency eflux, for although Government securities were Â£1,805,000 lower, other securities in- creased by Â£1.6 millions. Hence, the net result of the various changes was an expansion of Â£6.9 millions in the credit base. The whole of this expansion, how ever, was more than absorbed by a jump of Â£9,449,096 in public deposits to Â£21,450,305, so that bankers' deposits de clined by Â£1,709,816 to Â£107,898,931.

   "text_content" : "The first Stock Exchange Settlement of the war was arranged yesterday without any difficulties being dis- closed. This was in striking contrast with the position in 1914 when several firms failed on the eve of hostilities and a great many more 'were saved only by the general moratorium which was proclaimed. This time no moratorium has been necessary and less than three weeks after the outbreak of hostilities it has been possible to hold a satisfactory Settlement. The Settlement involved a good deal of strenuous work for Stock Exchange staffs. It covered the payment of differences on Contango accounts and normal stock de- liveries, as well as the settlement of differ- ences on cash bargains done up to 15th September, inclusive. STRAIN ON STAFFS The resulting work imposed some strain on staffs depleted by the war. Some offices reported that in a physical sense yesterday had been the most difficult Account Day for a long time. The smooth settlement was a contribu- tive factor in a better tone to markets generally yesterday. On the other hand, maintenance of Bank Rate at 4 per cent. disappointed some quarters in the City. The Stock Exchange had been hoping that the deadlock in the gilt-edged market, caused by the absence of buyers at fixed minimum prices, would have been eased by a cut in Bank Rate. Although minimum prices for British Government and kindred stocks when first fixed on 24th August provided a reasonable basis for dealing, they have proved too high to furnish such a basis since the outbreak of war. As a result there has been an absence of buyers and a continued stream of selling has caused the market to dry up altogether. EFFECT SPREADS The effect of this position has spread to other markets, investors in need of funds having been forced by the lack of a market in gilt-edged to realise leading Industrials and other popular securities. The absence yesterday of a reduction of Bank Rate mainly affected sections of the Stock Exchange outside the gilt-edged market. After a firm opening leading In- dustrial shares became easier, mainly because dealers were apprehensive that a continuance of the unsatisfactory position in gilt-edged might be reflected in further selling of Industrials. Although the discount market generally had kept an open mind on the subject of Bank Rate, there were expressions of disappointment when the official minimum was left unchanged at 4 per cent. yesterday. The big banks are complaining at their inability to satisfy their bill requirements. This is due to the understandable reluc- tance of the market to sell bills as long as the belief prevails that, sooner or later, Bank Rate must come down.",

   "text_content" : "The annual general meeting of the Barrow Barnsley Main Collieries, Ltd., was held yesterday at Queen's Hotel, Leeds, THE HON. ROBERT JAMES (chairman of the company) presiding. The Secretary (Mr. J. Richards) read the notice convening the meeting and Mr. Rodnell read the report of the auditors. The Chairman, after referring to the accounts and making comparisons with those of the previous year, said: The re- suits of the year under review have been very disappointing. The reasons are set out in the directors' report. Although the coking company, in which you have a two- thirds interest, made profits, they were in no way comparable with those of the pre- vious year. Not only was there a big fall in the price of coke for furnaces as well as for domestic purposes, but also there was a serious shrinkage in the amount supplied. Thus we were forced to reduce substan- tially the production of coke, thereby in- creasing the cost of manufacture as well as depriving us of revenue which we should have earned from gas and other by-products had we been able to run the ovens to full capacity. In this respect there are few companies owning coke plants that did not suffer severely during this period. In fact, it was only due to the energy and foresight of our sales organisation that we were able to maintain as big a standard of production as we did. THE COLLIERIES As regards the collieries, there has been a series of mining difficulties at the Barrow colliery, which have involved the closing of certain districts and a reduced produc- tion. I hope and believe, however, that this is a thing of the past. New districts are being opened up and new haulages laid out; production is again on the'up-grade, and before long we should not only reach but be able to improve upon our previous outputs. Further price lists, which have long been the subject of negotiation, have at last been concluded, and I trust that they will result in better earnings for the men and an increased profit for the company because no bargain is a good one or lkely to be lasting if it does not benefit both parties. The bright feature of the year has been the Barnsley Main Colliery, where the results have shown a definite improvement. Your company has recently purchased the Monk Bretton Colliery, which is adjacent to our pits, and will enable us to work the seams above the Barnsley bed, which we already have on lease, without having to go to the expense of having to sink addi- tional shafts. We have already started work here in some pillars still remaining in the Barnsley seam, and have com- menced to develop the famous Beamshaw seam, well known for its house qualities. Before long we hope to reach a production of 500 tons per day. Your directors believe that this will prove a very valuable addi- tion to your company. It is with great regret that I have to report the retirement of Mr. William Hay as managing director. We have been par- ticularly fortunate in getting his son, Professor Douglas Hay, to take his place as managing director. A forecast of the future is rendered very difficult by the war. Still, I think we can look forward to a higher production at the collieries, particularly at the Barrow pits, and also a full production from the coke ovens. What the prices will be I cannot say because these are under Government control, but I assume that if, as we hope, we work economically we shall be allowed to retain a reasonable profit. The report and accounts were adopted.",

MR. A. C. MACDIARMID (the chairman) presided. The Chairman said: I do not think it is necessary for me to add much to what is stated in the explanatory circular issuer with the notice calling this meeting. Youi directors firmly believe that the mergei will prove of great benefit to your com- pany, and the incidence of war in no way affects this belief. FAIR BASIS OF FUSION The merger takes the form of an out- right purchase by your company of the capital of the Stanton Company, and youz directors are satisfied that the price is a fair and reasonable one. They strongly recommend the shareholders to approve of the transaction and to pass the neces- sary resolutions to increase the capital. We now know the results-of our com- pany's operations during the first eight months of the year, and I am glad to be able to inform you that they are consider- ably better than those of the corresponding period of 1938. I am sure, however, that at this stage in our national affairs you will not expect me to make any attempt at forecasting future results, and now that our country is involved in war a righteous war for the defence of civilisation and general decency among the nations of the world, I should like to feel that your direc- tors have the approval and support of the shareholders in carrying out the policy which they have laid down. BOARD'S POLICY IN WAR-TIME I can put that policy before you in a few words, starting from the assumption that we must prepare for a war that may endure for a period of three years. Our policy is, on the one hand, to hold our whole resources, potentialities and skill at the disposal of the Government for the successful prosecution of the war, and on the other hand to do our utmost to preserve throughout the difficult times ahead of us the fabric of our company, so that when peace comes we may emerge strong in re- sources and ready and able to deal with the conditions which will then arise. That is our policy. I trust it has the full sup- port of the shareholders, and I may add that we firmly believe that, combined with Stanton, we shall be in a stronger position to carry it out. You will be interested to learn that holders of over 90 per cent. of the Ordinary stock and of over 90 per cent. of the Pre- ference stock of the Stanton Company have ratified the agreement and accepted our offer. The resolutions were -dopted at all the meetings.",
