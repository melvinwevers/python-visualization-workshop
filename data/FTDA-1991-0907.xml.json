   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor AN UPBEAT prediction by Mr John Major that the UK econ- omy is about to enter a virtu- ous circle of steady growth and low inflation added fuel yester- day to general election specula- tion. The prime minister's signal that he is convinced the reces- sion is over and inflation will fal- to 4 per cent or less by the end of the year overshadowed his own efforts to play down the significance of the latest opinion polls. In comments on his return from a six-day visit to Moscow, Beijing and Hong Kong, Mr Major said that the \"snap- shots\" of popular opinion pro- vided by the polls would not greatly influence the timing of the election. The two latest polls have given the Conserva- tives leads of 2 and 4.5 percent- age points respectively after four months when Labour had been consistently ahead. Senior aides told journalists travelling with the prime min- ister that he was determined not to take \"risks\" by calling an early election. That reinforced the view of most cabinet ministers that he will wait until next spring. \"I rate the chances of a November election as 1 in a MIe 's tyl....................Page 4 dftorMl Comment........Page 6 Oplmem n fahon .....Page 6 Leax ............................ Page 22 Power breakftef.....Weekend I 100,\" one senior minister said. The strength of Mr Major's confidence on the economy appeared to surprise even the Treasury, which still remains uncertain about the precise timing and strength of an end to the recession. Most senior Whitehall econo- mists believe that the recovery will be slower and weaker than after previous recessions, with further sharp rises in unem- ployment and another wave of bankruptcies in prospect in the next few months. Mr Major, however, chose to stress rising consumer confi- dence after the cuts in interest rates. \"The point is we are begin- ning to see the economy turn- ing round,\" he said. \"I think that has a very natural effect on people's expectations and their behaviour and it begins to affect the economy itself. People begin to spend again which means the economy begins to grow and there is a general virtuous circle.\" The message, echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign sec retary, fuelled speculation among opposition parties that although Mr Major is still looking to 1992, he is preparing a \"dry run\" against the possi- bility that Labour support could weaken decisively over the next few weeks. That view was reinforced by an announcement that 10 days of globetrotting will be fol- lowed by another appearance for Mr Major on the interna- tional stage when he meets President Francois Mitterrand in Paris next Wednesday.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Smith, Labour Correspondent THE Trades Union Congress yesterday condemned the \"alien approach\" of some Japa- nese investors into the UK amid accusations by a senior union leader that the move was racist. The row, on the last day of the TUC's annual congress in Glasgow, marred attempts by union leaders to portray an image of unity and moderation in the run-up to the next elec- tion. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU engineer- ing union, said the resolution was racist and would send a negative message to potential inward investors. His warning comes when five unions, including his own, are competing to represent workers at the Derbyshire plant being set up by Toyota, the Japanese car maker. Toyota has drafted an agree- ment which includes a contro- versial \"no disruption\" clause, Negative message: the AEUPs Gavin Laird labelled as hypocrites delegates who condemned Japanese investor styles seen by some union leaders as tantamount to a no-strike requirement. The company wants to delay pay talks until at least 1994. It also wants a standard 39-hour five-day week, with the flexibility to roster workers for up to an extra two hours a day and on alternate Saturday mornings. Some unions fear that the TrC's approval of the \"alien approach\" resolution will jeop- ardise the chances of any union winning a deal to repre- sent Toyota workers. Proposed by the MSS, the left-led general technical union, the resolution drew attention to several recent Jap anese projects which had \"brought an alien approach to trade union organisation\". It criticised no-strike and compulsory arbitration clauses and said the TUC should pur- sue more actively a joint union approach to inward investors. Mr Ken Gill, MSS general secretary, said he strongly resented the allegations of rac- ism. Japanese-style beauty con- tests in which unions compete for a deal were \"feudal anda- lien\" to British traditions. Continued on Page 22 Japanese confidence, Page 2 Congress reports, Page 4 Shift In power, Page 6 Unions CotinUaed from Page 1 Congress backed the motion overwhelmingly, with only the AEU and GMB unlons voting against, after the TUC general council msaid it supported the motion with reservations.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourly ROLLS-ROYCE won a first crucial order yesterday for a new engine to power the Boe- ing 777, the only large commer- cial aircraft likely to be launched this decade. The Â£250m order for Thai Airways International regains some of the ground lost last month when British Airways gave a Â£400m contract to one of Rolls-Royce's main competi- tors, General Electric of the US, to supply engines for Boe- ing 777s. Rolls-Royce offered a more attractive financial package to Thai Airways than GE and Pratt & Whitney, the Thai chairman said. Rolls-Royce would not release details of the deal Although two other Pacific Rim airlines - Cathay and Geruda of Indonesia - have ordered similar Trent engines for their Airbus fleets, Thai becomes the all-important launch customer for Rolls-Royce's engine sales for the Doig 777. Sir Ralph Robins, the I ag gi M 1 * I Rolls-Royce chief executive, said Thai was a prestige car- rier operating in an area of sig- nificant growth in air trans- port. The order for six aircraft, with an option for six more, will be a relief to Rolls-Royce at a tough time for aeroengine manufacturers. But a number of analysts believed that Rolls-Royce would have had to make sub- stantial financial concessions to secure the contract. Financial concessions are a normal part of negotiations to secure aeroengine orders, par- ticularly during the intense competition surrounding model launches. Manufacturers hope to make profits from supplying parts and through after service. Analysts also warned that the contract still had to be approved by the Thai cabetL Irrespective of the financial arrangements, the sale will help establish the Trent m00 engine for the Boeing 777 series. Rolls-Royce said the Thai contract was the fifth order for the Treat \"family\" of engines. There were now orders and options for 180 aircraft worth Â£lbn. The company's shares rose 5p to 148p on the news. Air Nippon and Cathay Pacific are to decide shortly on whether to buy the Boeing 777 and if so, whether to power it with Rolls-Royce Trent The order was a rapid riposte to GE, fresh from its success in securing the BA contract for 15 aircraft with 15 options. Thai Airways has been a large GE customer. However, the contract does not solve one of Rolls-Royce's biggest problems, which is its lack of a customer base. Thai Airways will become Rousaoyoe's nth customer for bifan enines, while Pratt & Whtney has 43 and GE has 6 according to one Industry ana- Airh imes a reI Pae IamaSS 9601 s U"

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels and Laura Silber in Belgrade EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers last night agreed to proceed with today's Yugoslav peace conference in The Hague, without having secured the ceasefire which was to have been a condition for the negotiations. In spite of attacks by the Yugoslav federal army on Croat forces holding the town of Okucani, 80 miles south-east of Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister and president of the EC Council of Ministers, said in Brussels that \"relative peace and quiet has set in\" in Croatia. All six Yugoslav republics and the federal president and prime minister have accepted the EC's invitation to the con- ference, which is to be chaired by Lord Carrington, the former UK foreign secretary. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president who caved in to EC threats to isolate his republic unless he accepted mediation, telephoned The Hague to say he would be attending, Dutch officials said. Mr van den Broek made it clear that any group which failed to show up in The Hague risked being isolated by the Community. Senior EC diplo- mats said it would be spelt out to the conference participants that this was the last real chance for a mediated solution to the conflict. \"There has been and is an attempt to make the confer- ence fail, and we cannot accept that provocation,\" said Mr Gianni de Michells, the Italian foreign minister. The ministers concluded that the logic which persuaded them to go for an early conference - to keep up the momentum provided by Monday's political break- through on the ceasefire accords - had not changed.

The issue that most immedi- ately concerns Lithuanians, though, is the withdrawal of the estimated 90,000 Soviet troops stationed in Lithuania. But although they have been keeping a fragile line of com- munication open with the Soviet Baltic military com- mand there are fears that the army withdrawal will not be carried out rapidly - not least because troops and their fami- lies may be reluctant to leave the Baltics, where food sup- plies and living conditions are generally better than the other Soviet republics. In another reminder of the eq;Mqppbljems that may undermine Lithuania's attempts to build political sta- bility, leaders of the Lithua- nian Polish community - about 7 per cent of the popula- tion - yesterday threatened in a Polish newspaper to appeal to international human rights organisations about alleged political discrimination. After an emergency session, the Lithuanian parliament announced on Thursday that local councils in some Polish- dominated regions would be dissolved and direct rule imposed from Vilnius. Some leaders of these councils have been charged with collaborat- ing in or supporting the failed Soviet coup three weeks ago. It is expected that they will raise the issue at a Helsinki human rights convention in Vilnius this week. In another step forward in the international community, the first American diplomatic representative to arrive in the Baltic, Mr Curtis Kamman, announced in Vilnius that the US would be opening an embassy in all three Baltic states \"within a matter of weeks\". In the parliament building, some Lithuanian officials made the point, however, that it was United Nations recognition that was crucial.",

   "text_content" : "By Chrystia Freeland in Simferopol, Crimea THE deeply-tanned, well-fed citizens of Simferopol responded with equanimity to the Crimean parliament's half- hearted declaration of sover- eignty on Thursday. The law shifts more power and property to the Crimean government but emphasises that Crimea remains part of the Ukraine. Though Moscow news media played up the importance of the legislation, it is viewed locally as a political manoeu- vre designed to deflect atten- tion from the ruling commu- nists' involvement in the botched coup. In the declaration, the Cri- mean government claims exclusive ownership of its land, natural resources and coastal waters, asserts its right to close environmentally harm- ful industries and says the thousands of luxury dachas on the Crimean seaside now come under the autonomous repub- lic's jurisdiction. Last month, President Boris Yeltsin's office suggested that if the Ukraine left the Soviet Union it should surrender some of its territory to Russia. Crimea - which was trans- ferred to the Ukraine from Rus- sia in 1954 - was at the top of Mr Yeltsin's wish-list. Most Simferopol shoppers were unenthusiastic about Mr Yeltsin's claim, a surprising response given that more than half of Crimea's 2.5m inhabit- ants are Russian. \"I am for the Ukraine,\" declared 46-year-old welder Nina Petrovna. Hefting a bag overflowing with plums and peppers, she explained: \"The Ukraine is so rich, we feed all of Russia.\" By contrast, Mr Yuri Komov, head of Democratic Crimea, the small but feisty parliamen- tary opposition, is \"personally for Russia. While the Ukraine is taking the path of national development, Russia is moving towards democracy.\" But even Mr Komov thinks Crimea should remain with the Ukraine for the next decade. He worries that altering the borders sooner would embroil Crimea in a bloody dispute between the Ukraine and Rus- sia.",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow SENIOR Soviet financial managers yesterday learned that a new era had dawned in the Soviet Union. They were verbally assaulted by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the enfant ifrrpressible of post- communist economies. The setting was a plenary session of the World Economic Forum in Moscow's Metropole HoteL Prof Sachs was billed to \"moderate\" a session on finance and investment, but he severely aggravated it instead . Senior bankers and company execu- tives, grey in the service of seeking profitable investments, who had heard of the professor only as the saviour of Poland, were treated to the closest thing international economics has to a prima donna. Prof Sachs had challenged a panel of prominent specialists and executives to say when the rouble should be con- verted. Mr Valerian Kulikov, deputy chairman of the state bank Gosbank, said that rapid convertibility was \"an adventurist measure\". The Poles, who had done it quickly, had an export-ori- ented economy and a $4bn (Â£2.3bn) cushion of personal savings and were not repaying their foreign debt. None of this was true of the USSR. Mr Ivan Ivanov, former deputy chair- man of the Foreign Economic Relations Committee, said that convertibility would need at least $20bn a year for three years to support the rouble, and no one in the west was going to provide that. Mr Thomas Alibyegov, deputy chair- man of Vneshekonombank, the bank of foreign economic relations, said that convertibility was not a magic wand. The boyish professor had fidgeted furiously through all of this: given a microphone again, he became passion- ate. \"Listening to these experts, it's no surprise that this country has almost ceased to export. \"These arguments were widely believed in Latin America and were dis- credited. They were believed in eastern Europe in the 1980s and nobody believes them now. I am distressed and saddened to see them believed here. \"I learned something new here,\" said Prof Sachs with a sarcastic bark of laughter. \"I learned the Poles had an export-oriented economy. They didn't think so. \"Frankly, gentlemen, if you believe all that, you will never do anything because everything is always impossi- ble. I must say, your arguments are just plain silly.\"",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Lausanne MR Gueorgi Matjukhin, chairman of the Russian central bank, proposed yes- terday that part of the Soviet Union's foreign debt, rapidly approaching $70bn (Â£41.4bn), be converted into long-term dual currency bonds.. Other possibilities were to convert debt into equity or into new credits secured against gold, 'diamonds or oil rights, Mr Matjukhin told western financial executives attending a course at the International Institute for Man- agement Development in Lausanne. Noting that nearly half the debt was short-term, Mr Matjukhin said conver- sion into longer-term obligations would be one way in which western banks could help the Russian and other for- mer Soviet republics in their efforts to develop market-based economies. The idea of issuing bonds payable in either roubles or a western currency had been broached by Salomon Brothers before the New York bond- trading house ran into trouble over breaking US Treasury auction rules but, Mr Matjukhin said, other western banks had since voiced interest. Debt-into-equity swaps would enable foreign companies to buy into Russian and other republics' enterprises as their economies were privatised. Such solutions would also help to resolve differences among the republics over how to divide responsibility for the dissolved Soviet Union's debt. The Soviet state bank, responsible for the debt, would be transformed into an institution with the republics as share- holders.",

   "text_content" : "R Ronald Freeman has jumped from one hot seat to another. He has swapped a top job at Salomon Brothers the'embat- tied Wall Striet securities house, for another in charge of. aiding the reconstruction of ttlihvSoviet Uni&t-%nd\"4didtrt Europe. Mr Freeman took over in July as deputy head at the pub- licly-owned European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop- ment, where he spearheads operations to revive the econo- mies of the former communist bloc through privatisation and infrastructure projects. By chance, Mr Freeman nar- rowly missed the wave of unfa- vourable publicity that in the past month has swept over Salomon, which is accused of rigging Treasury bond auc- tions. Playing down the impact of the scandals, Mr Freeman said yesterday in his London office that he intends to keep his \"spiritual and emotional\" ties to his former employer. More pertinent to his current job will be the contacts he made in his 18 years at Salo- mon, where he specialised in mergers and acquisitions. Most recently, he headed the bank's investment banking activities in Europe and was involved in several trading deals involving Salomon in the USSR. Since moving to the EBRD, Mr Freeman has examined about 170 proposals for privati- sation schemes in the former communist bloc, 43 of them in the Soviet Union. Most of the projects involve participation by blue-chip companies of the sort that he encountered on Wall Street. \"I'm speaking to a lot of old friends,\" he says. The-heory Is that EBRD wfill advise on the skills needed\" take these projects -' whel Include ventures in energy; Adid1&iakilgMid environmSee tal schemes such as water puri- fication - from the ideas stage to a successful business, in many cases putting up loans or equity, possibly in partnership- with private finance houses. Even though only relatively few of the schemes are likely to go ahead, Mr Freeman believes the interest of such a \"I'm speaking to a lot of old friends,\" he says. large number of western com- panies is proof of the opportu- nities. He says that business interest in the Soviet Union - which he has visited four times since taking over at the EBRN - has been \"galvanised\" by the failure of the attempted coup. In the past week, Mr Free man has talked to about 12 big oil and gas companies which have demonstrated new inter- est in energy ventures. \"A lot of people are exhilarated that Gorbachev isn't on his own any more [in introducing democracy],\" he says. In Leningrad and Moscow, Mr Freeman and his 33-strong merchant banking team are examining the commercial prospects for several thousand state-owned industrial operations, from retailing to rocket facpri Apart .fim aali shops and cafes, which d *ie privatised relatively -eaily _by selling thmttW eaimisim. many of these enterprises appear unlikely to be able to survive without western help - in the form of loans or equity capital, or aid in areas such as setting up sales teams. But Mr Freeman insists that even simple ideas from the west can do a lot to put Soviet businesses on a better footing. One area is incentive schemes. \"Why not reward employees who work hard with western consumer goods, or even new apartments?\" he says. He is also talking to several Euro- pean retail banks about a scheme to set up a nationwide network of high-street lending agencies, which would channel loans to new businesses and people keen to take over state- owned factories. Mr Freeman says a key to the next few years for the Soviet Union is whether it can survive the winter without massive food shortages. Assuming this problem can be tackled, he is reasonably hope- ful that the industrial struc- ture of the Soviet Union can be transformed over the next few years. \"It may be painful but there is a good chance it will be peaceful,\" he says.

Mr Valentin Stepankov, the Russian prosecutor, said yes- terday Mr Lukyanov had been- charged on Thursday, a day after he was formally fired by the Congress of People's Depu- ties. Mr Lukyanov has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement in the August 18-21 coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev, his friend since law school. However, Mr Lukyanov made no effort to call the legislature into ses- sion to overturn the coup. Mr Stepankov, whose office is leading the investigation into the coup, gave no details of the case against Mr Luky- anov, the 14th person charged with treason, which carries a possible death sentence. Also charged are the seven surviving members of the eight-man emergency commit- tee which seized power, the three other KGB generals, Mr Gorbachev's chief of staff, a Politburo member and a dep- uty defence minister. Mr Stepankov denied reports in the Soviet press that a witch hunt was under way that could eventually rival the purges of Stalin in the late 1930s, in which three-man tri- bunals sentenced people with- out evidence,',!4, a4 igiq! died. \"There is no organised ter- ror or massive investigation,\" Mr Stepankov insisted.

   "text_content" : "By David Budchnin Brussels , FRANCE was last night bitterly criticised by most of its EC partners for blocking the import of more meat from cen- tral Europe and thereby failing to fulfil repeated promises of help for the region. The European Commission had proposed to increase by 50 per cent over five years the volume of food imports from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary bearing a preferential tariff. In the case of beef, this would have only amounted to an extra 550 tonnes in the first year of an association accord with these countries, compared to the EC's total annual con- sumption of 7m tonnes. The Dutch presidency of the EC, the Commission, and sev- eral ministers were furious after France refused to accept any alternative except EC credit to the Soviet Union to buy the extra food. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said Prance's behaviour was \"a disgrace\". The Commission has been striving to persuade EC gov- ernments to make trade con- cessions to bring to a speedy conclusion long-drawn-out negotiation on EC association accords for each of the three central European states. The issue Will now be put off until the end of the month. Ironically, just as the EC was locked in an old-fashioned bat- tie over farm protectionism, Baltic foreign ministers arrived to tell their EC counterparts that their states would like trade pacts and associate sta- tus with the Community. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said his country was not alone in wanting central Europe to sell its food mountain in the east rather than the west. Belgium and Ireland indeed sided with France, but without Paris' stance, they- would probably have accepted the Dutch presi- dency's compromise. This would involve the EC funding the offloading of half the extra central European food on Soviet or third country markets. East Europe's tradi- tional food sales to the Soviet Union have plummeted, because of the latter's shortage of hard currency.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington THE US employment rate was unchanged at 6.8 per cent last month, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The flat conditions boosted hopes that a weak US economic recovery is under way. Non-farm payrolls, the key employment barometer, were largely unchanged in August, but there were modest gains in manufacturing jobs and a con- tinuing increase in the factory work week. It is now at the same level as July 1990, when the recession began. Mr Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President George Bush, said the August figures confirmed earlier administration forecasts that the'economy would improve in the second half of 1991. \"We haven't said it's healthy, we've said it is improving,\" he said. Mr Boskin predicted growth in the second half of this year of 2.5-3 per cent. This is less than half the rate of expansion in typical postwar recoveries, and congressional Democrats seized on the employment data to press their case for extend ing benefits to jobless workers. The unemployment rate has hovered around 6.8 per cent since last March, and yester- day's figures were eagerly awaited by the financial mar- kets, which have been watch- ing for signs that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates further to stimulate the recovery. Although the pressure may have eased slightly yesterday, Mr Boskin suggested that the Fed could do more to foster a recovery by increasing the nation's money supply \"well up into its target ranges.\" Jobs data are often volatile in the early stages of a recov- ery. Yesterday, Dr Janet Nor- wood, the head of the Bureau of Labour statistics, cautioned in testimony to the Senate that the labour market last month \"continued to lack clear direc- tion.\" Total employment lell by about 300,000 to 116.4m last month, some 1.5m lower than in July 1990. The number of unemployed Americans remains at 8.5m, about 1.7m higher than in July 1990. Manufacturing jobs rose by 42,000, consolidating July's modest gains in car-related industries; but these increases were offset by equally modest job losses in construction, the wholesale trade, and mining, which continued a six-month string of losses.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor AT 72, Lord Carrngton, who has been appointed as chair- man, or \"co-ordinator\", of the Yugoslav peace conference, is facing one of the most delicate tasks of his long and distin- guished career. As the former British For- eign Secretary admits, his greatest previous achievement - the 1979 Lancaster House agreement which ended white rule in Rhodesia and led to the creation of an independent Zimbabwe - cannot be com- ared with the Yugoslav prob \"The Lancaster House con- ference was essentially a domestic matter. We, the Brit ish, were responsible for Rho desia We held a few cards In -ur own hands.\" A requisite for solving a -roblem of this kind is that al the participants want a settle- ment to be reached. That was certainly true of the Lancaster House confer- ence. \"I am not sure that this is the case in Yugoslavia, for the moment.\" He sees his role in brokering a peace agreement in Yugo- slavia as much more like medl ating in a dispute between two Nato countries, a process he was frequently involved in du- ing his term as Nato sec- retary-general from 1984 to 1988. One of the preconditions for a successful outcome to such efforts, he stresses, is that the parties involved should not be fighting each other while nego- tiations on a political solution of their dispute are going on. Lord Carrington has no doubts that the EC is right to intervene. \"If the Community is to have a political reality when something like this ha- pens on its borders, which his- torically affects its members, it is right that it should seek solutions.\" Though not pretending to have any special expertise on Yugoslavia, Lord Carrington has had some first-hand experi- ence of its problems. He was a member of the first British par- liamentary delegation to visit Yugoslavia in 1949, after Bel- grade's break with Moscow. \"I knew Tito [Marshal Tito, the late Yugoslav leader] very well and once spent a whole day with him in Bosnia. One therefore has an idea of what their problems are,\" Lord Car- rington says in a typical under- statement. Lord Carrington hotly denies that he has been getting itchy feet at Christie's, the art auc- tion house of which he has been chairman since 1988. \"I am very happy at Chris- tie's and hope to continue as chairman if they still want me,\" he insists. But if you dre asked to do a job like chairing the Irish political talks, for which he was vetoed earlier this year by the Ulster Union- ists, or to preside over the Yugoslav peace conference, \"you can't refuge, can you?\" Carrington: broker's role",

   "text_content" : "By Alleon Smith SENIOR MINISTERS launched a concerted offensive yesterday, based on growing conidence among the Conservatves that the economic rec will happen in time to help them Ã½nan o Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign sec- retary, said the government's funda- mental strategy of \"freemarkets and sound finance has stood the test of *t won't be lost on the elector- ate.

   "text_content" : "T IS not enough to win a general election. But as Mr John Major returns this weekend to the mundane reali- ties of domestic politics he can draw much satisfaction from his recent spell on the interna- tional stage. After an unsure start to his premiership, he no longer. looks an interloper in the coun- sels of Mr George Bush or Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. The Con- servatives have snatched an edge in the opinion polls. His own standing with the elector- ate - as well as his lead over Mr Neil Kinnock - has been reinforced by 10 days of flatter- ing photo-opportunities. During a hectic trip which, with only a brief interval, took in Kennebunkport, Moscow, Beijing and Hong Kong, Mr Major showed the confidence that comes with familiarity. There was little of the fiery unpredictability of Mrs Mar- garet Thatcher but neither was there any longer the awkward reticence of the new boy at school. Most important, he provided frequent glimpses of the formi- dable political skills that took him from backbench MP to prime minister in little more than a decade. Party politics and government policies are beginning to coincide with ever-greater precision. There was much in the trip that was style rather than sub- stance. The well-publicised Soviet aid plan agreed with President Bush, in between photograph sessions at his Maine retreat, turned out in essence to be a reshaping of existing policies. In Moscow for just nine libui, Mr Major had to listen rather than lecture. His role as chairman of the G7 group of nations was not enough to make him more than an inter- ested bystander in the power striggles of Mr Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin. A public condemnation in Beijing of the Chinese leaders who crushed democracy in Tiananmen Square two years ago was dismissed even by some in his own entourage as \"political froth\". Regardless of whether Premier Li Peng responded to such strictures on human rights, a shared respon- sibility for Hong Kong meant Mr Major could claim jusitly that his travels had done more than simply bolster his reputation that Mr Major would continue to do business with him. In Hong Kong he showed flashes of tetchiness in response to charges that stri- king a deal with Beijing over a new airport or a court of appeal was not enough. Local political leaders argued ford- bly that deference towards China before the colony's transfer in 1997 was denying Hong Kong the democracy sweeping the rest of the world. At least once, Mr Major showed himself too easily wounded by criticism. Yet in international diplo- macy, style more often than not merges with substance; and in a world too complicated for neat solutions, Mr Major could claim justly that his travels had done more than simply bolster his reputation with the British electorate. The US had been nudged fur- ther in the direction of accep- tance, that the Soviet Union's full membership of the Interna- tional Monetary Fund would provide the only credible back- drop for a comprehensive pro- gramme of economic reform. The leaders he met in Moscow had seemed impressed by the argument that the sooner they began negotiations with the IMF the better the chance of averting complete economic collapse. In spite of the unease among local political leaders, Mr Major's case that a restoration of normal relations with China offered the best opportunity of maintaining confidence during the approach to 1997 was not lost on Hong Kong's business community. But it was in his handling of the human-rights question in Beijing that Mr Major demon- strated his political acumen. When he left London at the weekend, the consensus was that the mere fact of his talks with such a regime would lose the government political points. Yet the Foreign Office was advising that, whatever he might say in private, Mr Major should not jeopardise negotia- tions over Hong Kong with too public a condemnation of disre- gard for human rights. By the time he had arrived in China, Mr Major was receiv- ing reports from London that some of his critics - notably Amnesty International - were moderating their stance. If Mr Major condemned the political detentions and religious perse- cution in Tibet, then the visit might be judged worthwhile. It did not take him long to decide he would seize the opportunity to turn a poltical negative Into a plus. The of dci advice was disregarded. A soon as the deal on Hong Kong had been sealed, Mr Major roundly condemned his hosts. The images transmitted back to London by the reporters in his entourage were those not of an embarrassed supplicant but of a brave leader sticking to The globe-trottitg is sched- uled to continue over coming weeks. Mr Major flies to Paris for talks on Wednesday with President Frangois Mitterrand. Next month it will be the Com- monwealth summit in Harare. Then there is the prospect of two, if not three, European Community summits. His role as G7 chairman may take him back to Moscow. Mr Major can be relied on to extract the best from every photocall. If he now looks like a prime minister enjoying rather than enduring his work, Mr Major has not been swept up by his own public relations. There is considerable satis- faction with the polls - above all with the indicators showing a revival in economic opti- mism. Still, Mr Major spent too long in the Treasury to be impressed by a single months statistics. He is aware that the promise of economic revival may not be enough when the party conference turns the spotlight to domestic issues over the next few weeks. He will not rule out Novem- ber for the election. But the betting of those closest to him remains firmly on the spring.",

   "text_content" : "By Lis Wood, Labour Staff IT WAS on the principle of Buggins's turn that Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, gen- eral-secretary of Nupe, the public-ser- vices union, yesterday became presi- dent of the Trades Union Congress. If the position had been decided by elec- tion, he might have won anyway. A poll published last week in the New Statesman, in which 100 trade union leaders rated the TUC general council, put 46:year-old, Yorkshire-born Mr Bickerstaffe in first place. Left of centre in the labour move- ment, he is described by his peers as combining a passion about the interests of his members with a commitment to the unity of the trade union movement. His external critics, notably govern- ment ministers, point to Nupe's advo- cacy of controversial issues, such as a national minimum wage, and its close involvement with the Winter of Discon- tent in 1978-79. Both those considerations might be important for the TUC in the approach to a general election. The president of the TUC, who serves a one-year term, has little constitutional power - he or she chairs the general council's monthly meeting and its finance and general purposes committee. But the incumbent can be a figurehead for the TUC, particularly when Mr Norman Willis, its general-secretary, is strug- gling to articulate the TUC's policies. Nupe is media-conscious. Sober- suited Mr Bickerstaffe can be an astute performer, not getting involved in left- right union debates but more than will- ing to get up early for breakfast TV to argue with a minister over the impact of a national minimum wage on employment - he believes it would cre- ate jobs because productivity would increase and the spending power of the low-paid would grow. Mr Bickerstaffe describes himself as conservative with a small c. \"I change, but I am not the first person to do so,\" he says. Elected three months ago to the presi- dency of an.EC trade-union committee, he says: \"I was always opposed to Europe but now that important direc- * tives are coming out of Brussels it is clear that we have to be involved.\" Alongside such hard-headed analysis of where a modem trade union should be, Mr Bickerstaffe displays the strong emotion of the trade-union fundamen- talist. He is proud that he was pictured under a Nupe banner at the age of nine and that his mother was a Nupe activ- ist. He points out that his great-grand- mother died in the workhouse. With those credentials to draw on, his style of oration this week was as usual in the best \"gutsy\" traditions of old-fashioned trade union ranters like his friends Mr Ron Todd, general secre- tary of the TGWU general union, and Mr Ken Gill, general secretary of MSS.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivor Owen THE Labour party was accued by Mr Tom King, defence sec- retary, yesterday of trying to hide its continuing commit- ment to unilateral nuclear dis- armament. He said the Labour party was prepared to \"gamble away\" the entire British deter- rent in return for a fraction of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Mr King said the outcome would be the \"classic unilater- alimt position\" with a host of nuclear weapon targeted on Britain, which would be shorn of its own nuclear armoury. In a Jibe at Mr Nel Kinnock, the Labour leader, he said \"no amount of lapsed CND mem- bership fees\" could conceal the \"real\" position. Mr King reafrmed the need to ensure that the reductions in Britain's forces were phased carefully over a period of years and warnedof \"potential new dangers\" emerging from the fraile condition of much of eastern Europe and beyond. The government did not make the mistake - \"as oth- ers persistently do\" - of assuming that the apparent disappearance of one threat meant the disappearance of all. Mr King said both Labour and the Liberal Democrats were clamouring for massive reductions in defence expendi- ture \"far beyond what is sensi- ble at this time\". Without the firm and decisive leadership given by Britain since the Con- servatives returned to power in 1979, he said, the shape of Europe might have been very different.",

   "text_content" : "MINERS yesterday attacked a decision by British Coal to dock the pay of 66 men involved in an underground accident. The workers were left shocked and shaken after a conveyor belt taking them to the face went out of control at Thurcroft Colliery, near Roth- erham, South Yorkshire, on Tuesday. British Coal says 42 men who were taken to hospital as a result of the incident will be paid as normal. The 66 others not taken to hospital stand to lose up to Â£45 each because they did not return to work. The men were given check- ups at the colliery medical cen- tre, then went home, shaken and suffering from minor cuts and bruises. They will be paid only for the two hours they spent underground waiting to be rescued. Because production at the pit was halted, a total of 500 men will lose between Â£10 and Â£15 in bonuses. Mr Paul Roddis, NUM branch secretary, said the 66 men affected would' lose between Â£25 and Â£30 in wages plus up to Â£15 in lost bonuses. He said: \"The British Coal decision is absolutely disgust- ing. These men are being pen- alised for something that was not their fault. It is true that taking the letter of our agree- ment British Coal are within their rights, but this is a harsh interpretation.\" British Coal said: \"All the men will be paid in accordance with standard procedure agreed between British Coal and the unions.\" Didcot inquiry THE Department of Energy is to hold a public inquiry into National Power's plans for a second power station at Didcot, Oxfordshire, after local people raised objections to the pro- posed gas-fired station.

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen, Investments Correspondent ROYAL Insurance Group said yesterday it planned to elimi- nateo 60jobs in its Royal Life subsidiary,about 15 per cent of the orkforce, as part of a restructuring intended to *reduce costs. The main changes involve merging the administrative operations and streamlining the organisation. Royal said the changes were part of a review that included the restructuring of US operations and revision of UK pricing and underwriting practices. The company said the num- ber of involuntary redundan- cies was still not clear. It would first eliminate jobs through natural wastage and by offering early retirement and voluntary redundancies. MSS, the financial services union which represents 75 per cent of workers at Royal Life and which has sole bargaining rights, 'said it was seeking to prevent involuntary redun- dancy. the company said the restructuring reflected its rapid expansion in the 19s, when its workforce grew five- fold. As a result, the company found t had duplicated aditn istrative services, marketing and other unictions. The life assurance unit, a significant writer of' endow- ment policies and mortgage insurance, has been affected by the fall in house prices and the rise in mortgage repossessions. Royal had also seen a.declne in its personal pensions busi- ness as executive redundancies increased. Royal's move to shed jobs Is the largest among the UK life groups, which have all been affected by rising claims and falling new business. Others, such as Sun Life, have announced more modest staff cuts. Royal had reported first- half losses of Â£97m and announced mortgage indem- nity insurance losses of W45m."

   "text_content" : "By John Authors THE Co-operative Bank, a child of the trade union move- ment, is introducing a credit card that will be free for life for what it calls wealthy \"high rollers\". The move has been timed to cash in on the deluge of criti- cism of the Big Four clearing banks - Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and Lloyds - that have levied annual charges on their credit cards. All claim to have made heavy losses on their credit card operations over the past three years, blaming the increasing proportion of cardholders who \"freeload\" by repaying their bills in full each month. The Co-op's new Visa Gold card guarantees never to levy a fee during the life of, the holder. There is one catch - the longest possible period for free credit has been reduced. The card is not aimed at the Co-op's traditional constitu- ency. Holders must earn at least Â£20,000 a year and be home owners, and the bank admits that it expects to reject most applicants. The offer closes at the end of this year. The bank wants to attract people who pay in full each month. It hopes these wealthy customers will be encouraged to bring more of their lucrative business to the bank. Mr Terry Thomas, the mar- keting manager behind the new launch, parried criticism that this was a betrayal of the Co-op's principles, saying: \"We're supposed to be a class- less society.\" Details, Weekend U"

   "text_content" : "By Charle Ba~mh.or mad David Earchard THE LATEST half-percent- age-point cut in interest rates is unlikely to have a signifi- cant impact on the finances of Britain's small companies. If the full value of the cut is passed on by the banks, it will mean that small businesses should save a total of about Â£150m. Lending to them by the UK banks stands at about Â£45bn, of which Â£30bn is at variable rates. Many businesses will not feel the benefits of the latest cut - the first since Mr Nor- man Lamont, the chancellor of the Exchequer, issued his report on the way banks treat their small-business customers - until the banks deduct inter- est charges at the end of December. Some may see the reduction neutralised by a bank manager's decision to raise interest charges on the ground that the business has become a riskier ptoposition. Small-business lobby groups such as the National Federa- tion of Self Employed and Small Businesses and the Asso- ciation of Independent Busi- nesses are pinning their hopes Delays in store: businesses inch as corner shops may have to waRt ror cnaiper loUns on a further half-point cut about the time of the Tory party conference in October. The association believes it will be spring or summer next year before the recent series of interest-rate cuts has an appre- ciable effect on the cash flow of small companies - and even then, much will depend on the strength of any recovery in demand. The banks insist that the overwhelming majority of their small-business customers will benefit from the cut. The effect of movements irn interest rates - both up and down - is delayed by the way in which the banks implement changes. Most change te daily calculation of interest charges as soon as a change in rates is announced, but they do not bill customers until the end of the quarter. That means interest charges deducted at the end of Septem- ber will include only a few days at the lower rate. Custom- ers will not benefit from a Aull quarter at the lower level until the end of December. The latest cut in interest rates may also be overtaken by a bank manager's review of a customer's borrowing arrange- ments. Mr Jim Watson. owner of a pub and restaurant in Mar- gate, and Kent regional trea- surer for the National Federa- tion, said \"The banks have recently gone from annual to six-monthly and in some cases four-monthly reviews. And of course they charge you for the review.\" * According to the Big Four clearing banks, recession rather than high interest rates is now the main headache for small businesses. Mr Andrew Hunter, small- business manager at National Westminster, said: \"The princi- pal problem facing the market is obviously recession. Sales and employment are at their lowest level since 1984.\" Barclays said late payment by suppliers, the uniform busi- ness rate, and the recession are what now caused businesses most grief. Interest rates are blamed by 15 per cent, against 29 per cent a year ago, while late payment is quoted by 12 per cent. The banks believe last sum- mer's controversy about bank charges to small- companies has produced changes in the relationship between banks and their customers. Both the National Federation and the Forum of Private Bust- ness reported that members continued to have difficulties in dealing with their banks, with managers raising charges or reducing loan facilities in spite of the chancellor's call for bank codes of conduct. Lloyds said since the furore over charges to small busi- nesses last summer, more busi- nesses were in regular commu- nication with their banks over their difficulties, and managers were spending more time talking to them. Lloyds and the other banks are trying to produce the cus- tomers' charter for small busi- nesses, which the chancellor asked them to produce. Lloyds believes it will have its small business charter in operation by November. Yet all the banks admit that real changes in the plight of many small businesses are some way off and cannot be expected until the economy - and domestic demand - revive strongly. That looks unlikely to happen; they say, until the spring at the earliest. Bank managers suffer too, Weekend VI",

At the end of last year Hali- fax hadto put aside 54.am in provisions on residential mort- gage lending that was In trou- ble. This yews fgure i cer- tain to be higher - the half-year figure may well be near the total for the whole of 190. Higher bad-loan provisions repesent a double tnhi r tsig- nal for -the market.

This week Halifax admitted that although it had foreseen the likely number of homes that would have to be repo- sessed, it had not realised how far the housing market would fal and that it, would not be able to recover as much of its money as it expected from forced property sale: hence the higher-tamez pp mi- sins.

   "text_content" : "MR PHIL REDMOND'S North West Television lau*ched a ferocious attack yesterday -on rival Granada as the fraichise battle intensified. North West, which has out- bid Granada inthe competltivP: tenders for a new i10year com- mercial broadcasting licene for north4-eat England, said Granada did not deserve to be saved by the Indepndnt Tele- vision Commission. The ITC has the discretion to award the franchise to a lower bidder in \"exceptional circumstances\". Mr Allan Hardy, commercial director of Yorkshire Televi- sion, which has a minority stake in the North West con- sortium, said that if Granada lost \"no one would notice it if it left\". Mr Hardy said that last year Granada produced 190 pro- grammes which had audiences of more than 9.5m for the ITV network. But, Mr' Hardy said, 155 of those were the soap opera Coronation Street, leav- ing only 35 programmes attracting that number of view- ers. Thames Television (which has also been outbid) had a much stronger case for \"excep- tional circumstances\" because of its economic importance to the network. In the same year, Thames had produced 203 pro- grammes with audiences of more than 9.5m - 90 of them accounted for by the police series The Bill. Mr Hardy said until this March, Granada had regularly been beaten by the BBC in local news. He also argued that it was a myth to say that if one or two of the big network production companies were to lose their franchises there would be a \"black hole\" in the network. The new central scheduler for the network would be \"embarrassed by choice\". In addition to the proposals of the new players the central sched- uler would be able to call on programmes made by ITV com- panies that have lost fran- chises and become independent producers. North West has bid about Â£35m for the ftanchise and Granada has bid less than Â£20m."

   "text_content" : "_ _ _ _ __ By Richard Evans NICHOLAS GRIMSHAW & Partners, the British firm of architects, has won an interna- tional competition to design a new stock exchange and cornm munications complex in Ber- lin, the proposed capital of Germany. The project, which is expec- ted to be started next year, is complicated by the need to keep the existing stock exchange going while the new one, which is three times the size, is built on the site. As well as the new exchange with a traditional trading floor, the complex will contain offices, restaurants, exhibition space and conference and other facilities for chambers of commerce and industrial organisations. Offices will be suspended above the trading floor. The new exchange is part of the trend to make Berlin a much more significant financial centre now that Ger- many has been reunited. The .contract was won against competition from nine German architects, including six from Berlin, plus one from France and one from Austria. The schemes will be dis- played at an exhibition in Ber- Iln on September 18, when the contract will be signed. The overall cost has not been dis- closed. Award-winning schemes designed by Nicholas Grim- shaw & Partners in the UK include the high-tech Sains- bury supermarket in Camden Town, north London, the inter- national Channel tunnel termi- nal under construction at Waterloo, London, and the Financial Times printing works in east London.

   "text_content" : "SIR RAYMOND BROWN, who died on Thursday aged 71, was an energetic industrialist equally skilled in engineering and marketing, who jointly founded Racal, the electronics company, and worked in the public and the private sectors. Born in July 1920, he left school at 14 to join Redifon as an engineering apprentice and studied by night at the South East London Technical College and at Morley College. During the Second World War he was seconded to the government to help install radio navigation beacons for the RAF and decoys for enemy aircraft. In 1949 he moved to Plessey as sales manager of the communications division. He left in 1950 and with Â£100 set up his own company to manufacture high-frequency radios, in conjunction with Wing Commander Calder Cun- ningham. The two men called it Racal, a combination of the first few letters of each of their first names. The company was floated in 1961, and Sir Raymond remained chairman and man- aging director until 1966. At his departure dinner he dropped a bunch of keys into the hand of his successor, Sir Ernest Har- rison, and said: \"It's all yours.\" The Labour government per- suaded him to leave Racal and help the Ministry of Defence establish a defence sales unit. He worked there for three years and was rewarded with a knighthood in 1969. He advised the Department of Health and Social Security on commercial policy and exports until 1972. He maintained his business interests, becoming in 1970 chief executive and managing director of Muirhead, an elec- tronics company which was one of the pioneer manufactur- ers of fax machines. He served as chairman from 1972 to 1985 and then spent five years as executive director of STC until 1990. He was a director of the National Westminster Bank outer London region from 1978 to 1964.

   "text_content" : "THE UK stock matket's response to this week's cut in base rates looked a little grudg- ing after the buoyant perfor- mance of equities in the holi- day season. But that is unlikely to have caused much loss of sleep to the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. For him the more telling reaction will have been in the foreign exchange markets, where sterling remained close to the centre of its fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The pound scarcely twitched in response to the cut, even though the margin between comparable UK and German short-term interest rates has now shrunk to less than 1% percentage points from a spread of 7 per- centage points last October. That leaves open the possibil- ity of further cuts before the general election, whose timing is now the subject of increas- ingly feverish speculation. But it also raises the question of how far increased convergence between sterling and D-Mark interest rates reflects the enhanced credibility of British monetary policy within the ERM and how far it simply results from the quite extraor- dinary circumstances sur- rounding German unification. The good news, from Mr Lamont's point of view, is. that the UK headline rate of infla- tion looks set to fall below 4 per cent in October, from 11 per cent at the peak last year. That will almost certainly be below the comparable German rate. Yet the retail prices index in Britain exaggerates the rate at which inflation is falling, most notably because it includes mortgage interest. A low rate of increase in retail prices is not synonymous with an internationally competitive level of inflation, which is what Britain needs to achieve before it can fulfil its growth potential with the ERM. The more pressing questions con- cern the rate of increase in UK earnings and unit labour costs. Earnings growth So far the slowdown in aver- age earnings growth has been unhurried, to put it kindly. From a peak of over 10 per cent last year the figure has fallen to 8% per cent - marginally above the comparable figure in Italy and around double the rate in France. But there are signs that the level of settle- ments in manufacturing is finally beginning to reflect the impact of recession and rising unemployment figures. The Confederation of British Indus- try reports that settlements in the second quarter of this year had fallen to about 6.5 per cent, compared with 9 per cent at the end of 1990. Some economists argue that uneinployment is now exerting a more powerful restraining influence on earnings because of the lower proportion of long-term jobless in the total. The long-term unemployed'are less attractive to employers and less active job seekers, thereby applying less down- ward pressure on wages than the more recently unemployed. Structural changes At the same time changes in the structure of the labour market after the Thatcher decade, including the decline in union power and the decen- tralisation of pay bargaining, must also have had some effect. A further factor is the different regional distribution of unemployment compared with the recession of the early 1980s, when an overvalued exchange rate penalised exporters north of Watford. The present recession has been driven primarily by a squeeze on heavily indebted borrowers in the corporate and personal sectors, who face real rates of interest higher than at any time since the Depression. Many of those borrowers are workers in service industries in the south-east. For them, higher pay may suddenly seem less attractive than job secu- rity; many are more mobile than their counterparts in tra- ditional manufacturing indus- tries in the north. Time will tell; but there is little doubt that unit labour costs are due to fall sharply in manufacturing on the basis of increased productivity follow- ing the labour shake-out that is already well under way. Even at unchanged levels of activity this will ensure increased out- put per head and higher profits for industry next year. It also provides a measure of support for an equity market that has risen about 30 per cent since the start of the year on the basis of little tangible good news. Yet a sustained recovery cannot be built on labour-shedding. The personal sector will have to regain its confidence and lift consump- tion before the wheels of the economy turn freely again. This will no doubt happen in a modest way before the year is out. But the old questions remain. Will very modest recovery and declining mort- gage rates be enough to per- suade the electorate to put Mr John Major, who is suddenly riding high, back into Downing Street? And will the Germans put a spoke in his wheel by raising their interest rates at a sensitive political moment for the Tories? The capacity of the ERM to spring a nasty pre-elec- toral surprise should not be underestimated.",

   "text_content" : "By Charles Leadbeater t will be the managerial equivalent of closing a blast furnace when Sir Robert Scholey, retires as Brit- ish Steel chairman next July. Like a blast furnace - huge in stature, weather-beaten, black- ened by constant use - Sir Robert has pumped away at the heart of the British steel industry helping to make the former bloated British Steel Corporation into one of the most efficient steel producers in the western world. His successor, Sir Alistair Frame, though renowned in the mining industry as chair- man of RTZ is largely unknown in the close-knit world of the European steel industry. However competitors and suppliers would be mistaken in thinking Sir Robert's departure will deprive British Steel of its harder edge. Over the next year, Sir Robert, 70, will take considerable relish in tutoring his 62-year-old successor in the ways of an industry which at times seems like a secret soci- ety. Sir Alistair has already proved himself an able pupil.

   "text_content" : "Peter Norman asks if he urrent upbeat ecdnomic -mood is justified hat a difference a A pail of gloom has lifted from the British economy since the beginning of August At that time bleak surveys of busines. o i n from theeConfederation .British Industry and the Association of British Cham- bers of Commerce had eclipsed a modest surge of optimism in Jow the pendulum has swung the other way. Opti- mism is back in fashion, reinforced by Wednesday's sur- prise half percentage point cut in hank base rates to 10.5 ar. cent. Consumers have returned from their holidays more confl- dent and there is a growing perception among businessmen that conditions are certainly getting no worse. Yesterday, as speculation of an early November general election received further impe- tus from the latest Gallup poll giving the Conservatives a 4.5 percentage point lead over Labour, the prime minister added his own upbeat assess- ment of the economy. Mr Major suggested that the economy couldbe entering a \"virtuous circle\" as it comes out of the recession. \"We are beginning to see the economy turning round,\" he said in an interview with BSkyB televi- sion. \"People begin to spend again which means the econ- omy begins to grow.\" But what has really changed over the past few weeks? True, there have been some encour- aging statistics which suggest that earlier hopes of a recovery may at last be becoming real- ity. The provisional retail sales figures for July showed a small increase instead of a widely anticipated drop. Housing starts in the three months to July were up on both the previ- ous three months and the same period last year. August car registrations fell less sharply than feared. But other official figures - notably the money supply and credit statistics from the Bank of England - remain subdued and so far offer little hope for sustained recovery. Although individuals have gone a long way towards cutting their per- sonal debt burdens, the UK corporate sector remains heavily indebted. The main change over the past month has been in atti- tudes. One important clue was a sharp move in the economic optimism indicator published by MORI from minus seven in July to plus seven at the end of Auguist. This indicator gives the balance of voters' answers on whether they think that the general economic condition of the country will improve, stay the same or get worse over the next 12 months. This indicator leads eco- nomic activity, according to Mr Robert Worcester, MQri's chair- man. He says it also has been an accurate guide to voting intentions, notably in 1987 when it moved from negative to positive in the months before Mrs Thatcher's third election victory. But if there has been a change of mood - and the accompanying chart contains a cautionary tale by showing how a surge in economic opti- mism in April this year was not sustained - it has yet to be reflected in the way fore- casters view the economy until the end of 1992. The latest monthly survey of 32 forecasters. nublished ves- _ _ Â· Â· 0 \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t terday by Consensus Econom- ics, showed that their-average expectation was for a 2 per cent drop in UK gross domestic product this year and below- trend growth of 1.8 per cent in 1992. These findings, based on replies gathered on September 2, were unchanged from those in the previous survey of August 5. Yesterday, BZW, the City securities house, stuck its neck out and forecast 3 per cent growth in the UK economy next year. But offsetting such optimism, there are several forecasters who argue that next year's growth will be either below or only slightly higher than 1 per cent. Such divergences are com- monplace among economists. But they also highlight the problems of judging Britain's economic future in the still rel- atively novel environment of membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Only a month remains before the first anniversary of sterling joining the ERM, but it is still unclear how far Britain's econ- omy has adjusted to full EMS membership. There are some encouraging signs such, as the steady monthly drop of 0.25 percent- age points in average earnings growth since December. The City expects next Thursday's labour market figures will con- firm this trend, with underly- ing earnings growth slowing to 8 per cent in July from 8.25 per cent in June. On the other hand, the 736,000 jump in unemployment over the past 12 months shows how the ERM imposes a tough disciplinary framework on a weakening economy. It is also unclear how far the relative buoyancy of retail sales and exports reflects \"real\" economic strength in the UK. Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist of Shear- son Lehman Brothers in Lon- don, suspects that growth in these areas could be supply driven rather than demand led, with large scale discounting supporting sales. There is a good chance, how- ever, that the recession will formally end in the current quarter, if only because increased oil output will boost the industrial production fig- ures. Moreover, the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chan- cellor, to cut interest rates on Wednesday and the calm response that his action met on financial markets has increased the possibility of one further cut in base rates in the weeks ahed as nflation virtuous isimilar to that esred by Mr Usjor, that wtoiueus the l growund for a sibe Noveber election. ether they could repaire the way for a more sustained boost in economic activity Is open to quetion. Britain's ERM membershi means that the traditional UK escape from recession through monetary exipaiion and cur- rancy depreciation is no longer an option. Seen in this light, Mr Lam- ont's decision to cut rates this w.eek simply brought forward by a felr eeks, a move that ad beenwidely bilt into eco- nbmic expcts. Base rates have come down by 4.5 percentage points from 15 per cent'since Britain entered the ERM while the key German Lombard rate has risen by 1.25 points to 9.25 per cent. Taking three months money market rates as a guide, the differential between UK and German rates yesterday morning had shrunk to just over 1 percentage point from around 7 per cent. The narrowing of the differ- ential limits the scope for fur- ther rate cuts in Britain. The Bank of England does not believe UK interest rates can fall below German levels in the foreseeable future. Although the UK's headline inflation rate may drop below the German level this month and is almost certain to do so in October, when the annual rate of UK retail price inflation is expected to be well below 4 per cent, the UK's counter-in- flationary credentials are not yet sufficiently well estab- lished to allow a crossover ir rates. Moreover as the chart shows, economists generally expect inflation to creep up again after hitting a low point in October. Another half percentage point cut in UK base rates is possible. But further reduc- tions to below 10 per cent would probably have to wait for a decline in German rates. This in turn would depend on Germany's achieving clear con- trol over the inflationary pres- sures unleashed by unification, which is far from certain at present. Britain, like other ERM countries, therefore seems set to experience a regime of high real interest rates for some time to come that will restrain economic growth. he incipient euphoria about the economy will probably turn out to be as misplaced as the deep gloom of a month ago. With the UK firmly established as an ERM member, its economic perfor- mance is likely to look more akin to that of its EC partners. The example of France in recent years suggests steady, unspectacular growth rather than a bounce back from reces- sion. Such a development would lay the foundations for recovery without inflation, which Mr Major has said he wants. The cost - if the experience of France or the Netherlands is any guide - is a continuing high level of unemployment. A November election could there- fore be an increasingly attrac- tive option for the government if signs of economic recovery in the short term are supported by a strong showing in the opinion polls.",

   "text_content" : "The Labour party leadership and the unions are testing a new. modus .yivendi. John Wilmnan and Michael Smith report Does what goes on at the Trades Union Congress tmatter to the Labour party? Delegates to this week's annual congress in Glasgow certainly thought so. \"If it goes well, we might do the Labour party a bit of good,\" said one at the start of the week. \"If it goes badly, we could do it a lot of harm.\" The employment secretary, Mr Michael Howard, seemed to agree. He used the first day of congress to launch a campaign with the slogan \"The unions used to run the country: now they just run Labour\". Journalists were bombarded with press releases proclaim- ing fresh outrages - at least one on each day of the con- gress. His message was that the unions were not the pussy- cats they portrayed themselves to be. They would revive the old agenda of collectivism and state interference after the election, imposing it on a Labour government. Union delegates headed home yesterday satisfied that the week's proceedings had left the Labour party rela- tively unscathed. Mr Howard could be expected to plug away at the continuing exclu- sion of the electricians' union EETPU from the TUC and the snub delivered to Japanese inward investors whose approach to industrial rela- tions was described as \"alien\". But criticism of the mini- mum wage policy advocated by the unions and now adopted by Labour appears to have made little Impact on public opinion. Whatever the merits of the policy, it seems to be popular: in a MORI opin- ion poll released by the GMB general union at Glasgow, mentioning the minimum wage converted a majority for the Conservatives into a Labour victory. Nonetheless, it is clear that the links between the unions pand Labour are not popular with voters, even though pub- lic approval for unions is now higher than at any time since 1979. But there was some evi- dence this week that it is now Labour which calls the shots, rather than union paymasters. One sign came in the address on the opening day of Congress from this year's chairman of the Labour party, Mr Tom Sawyer. He warned delegates of the need to win public support in campaigns to extend workers' rights and improve pay and conditions: \"You want rights for a movement that doesn't say: 'We closed your hospital because we wanted to improve patient care...we closed your school to improve your chil- dren's education'.\" The need to consider the consumers of public services is now a strong theme in Labour's policy-making, and Ana which ha nt alwa sc hald I. Tom Sawyer: warning a clear ride from unions affill- ated to the party. For the con- gress to be lectured on it by Mr Sawyer was ironic: he is also deputy general secretary of NUPE, the public employ- ees' union which played a big role in the strikes of the \"win- ter of discontent\" that toppled the last Labour government. Labour leaders sought to influence the this week's TUC debates more directly. One of the few seriously embarrass- ing motions was that on Employment Action, a scheme to provide the unemployed with work experience which unions criticise for the low pay and low training content. Recognising that the deci- sion was likely to be in favour of a boycott, Mr Kinnock's office contacted the leaders of the major unions to ask them to be sure to moderate their language. The request was heeded, and few hostages were given in what might have been an acrimonious debate. As for the debate on trade union law, the unions now accept what Labour leaders have been telling them for some time: the clock cannot be wound back to 1979. The Con- servatives were denied a pro- paganda coup when the TGWU delegation was persuaded not to vote for Mr Arthur Scar- gill's motion which called for the Labour party to repeal all anti-union legislation. Mr Kinnock, a member of the TGWU who has not enjoyed the easiest of relation- ships with his union in the past, expressed himself well- pleased with the three-to-one defeat of his old adversary. For much of the 1980s, Labour party leaders relied on the unions to hold the party on an even keel. Union leaders set the agenda, and fended off the hard left activists. Now the balance of power is becoming less one-sided. Whether the change would last beyond the arrival of a Labour government cannot, of course, be known. Certainly for now there is remarkable unanimity on both sides that the new arms-length relation- ship is an improvement.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr JS Watson. Sir, Your \"Diary of a Private Investor\" article on the new Taurus settlement system (\"The hidden costs of Taurus\", August 31) was interesting because it illustrated the natu- ral, if unfounded, anxieties about change. There are, how- ever, a number of points which should be made to reassure your readers. The \"beggars of the stock exchange\" are investing sub- stantial sums of money in the future of the UK equity mar- ket. That money is directed towards the elimination of paper processes which have in the past caused backlogs, delays and errors to the incon- venience of the private inves- tor. London is one of the few equity markets where such paper processes still exist, and the Taurus system will bring the market into line with inter- national standards to the bene- fit of all investors. When Taurus is introduced, shareholders' statements from companies or brokers will show the aggregate total of shares in each company. That contrasts with the current situ- ation where a shareholder fre- quently has several certificates in an individual company, par- ticularly when the company offers scrip dividends. Some brokers are offering a nominee service ahead of the change to Taurus because their statements will show an inves- tor's holdings in all companies and because they believe they will be better able to help their clients during the two years it will take for all companies to transfer to Taurus. However, the choice is the investor's, and competition between bro- kers will ensure that those who choose to retain the record of their holdings directly with each company are unlikely to be disadvan- taged on price. The exchange has consis- tently said that the central costs to brokers will be less under Taurus, but it is the bro- kers who set their charges for services to clients. Settlement is a small part of a broker's overall costs, and naturally the implementation of the new sys- tem requires a capital invest- ment which must be recovered before the benefits can be passed on to clients. Much of the cost of Taurus arises from the determination of the exchange, its members and the government to incorpc rate the highest standards of investor protection. Regretta- bly this does not come free. Stock exchange members are ahead of Mr Goldstein-Jackson. They are already paying to pre vent error and fraud and to safegard their clients if these should occur. J S Watson, Taurus prqfect director, London Stock Ercharge, Lond.on EW IHP",

Just outside the temple gates, berond the dark suits and bouquets of white chrysanthemums, 500 riot police bore witness to the fact that Mr Ishii, a 67-year-old property dealer and stock market investor who died this week, was also the retired chief of Tokyo's largest gangster group. Officers in shields and helmets kept watch as the mourners came and went in luxury Mercedes limousines. Of all the secrets which have been exposed in Japan's financial scandals, none is more damaging to the country's international reputa- tion than evidence of dealings between big business and big crime. And few people made use of these links better than Mr Ishfi, whose contacts reached as high as the head office of Nomura Securities, the world's largest securities com- pany. Police said yesterday Mr Ishii's death would not affect their investi- gation of his links with financial companies. But they acknowledged there were questions which will never be answered following Mr Ishii's demise. Mr Ishii was known as an \"intel- lectual godfather\" among Japanese gangsters, or yakuza. He first caught the eye of his bosses by run- ning gambling dens and rose through the ranks of Inagawakai, the largest yakuza gang in Tokyo and the second biggest in Japan after the Osaka-based Yamaguchi- gumi. In 1986, he took control of the group, succeeding Mr Kakuji Ina- gawa, the founder. According to Japanese newspa- pas, Mr'Mil directed Inagawakai's resources away from the Iaksa's traditional operations in gambling, prostitution, extortiqn and drugs into leitimatebusinesses, includ- ing.prop ty, golf courses and stocksTPe boom in Japan's sinan- cial .narkets proved him right. 1fr Ishli's stdck market trading goeptbak to the mid-19e0s when he opened accounts at Nomura and Nikko. But he came to the notice of the brokers' head offices only in 1989 when he hatched a plan to corner- stock In Tokyu Cor- poration, a railway and property company. The brokers have admitted that through affiliates they lent Mr Ishil a total of Y36.2b4 (E158.07m) to buy the stock. They have also confirmed they were also among a dozen com- panies which together spent Y38bn on memberships in Iwama Country Club, a golf course Mr Ishii planned to build. As reported in parliamentary hearings, police suspect that after Mr Ishii bought 29m Tokyu shares, Nomura recommended the stock to other investors and sent the price soaring. Brokers believe Mr Ishii subsequently intended to try to \"greenmail\" Tokyu - to force it to buy his stock back. But last year's collapse in Japanese share prices put paid to the plan. Instead, Mr Ishli turned his atten- tion to Honshu Paper, a leading paper maker, buying shares in large amounts and dealing this time through Nikko, as a former Nikko executive told a parliamentary com- Lais wmaers for tbh boss meibers of lhe InMMwal gn ftlank the her carrying Mr sMils' body mittee this week. That was before severe illness forced Mr Ishii to retire. Police, who had been shadowing Mr Ishii for years, finally managed to penetrate his operations earlier this year when he is alleged to have failed to account correctly for a for- eign exchange deal West Tsucho, a company Mr Ishii controlled, bought Asset Management, Financ- ing and Settlement, an American financial services business, for Y720m. Unfortunately for Mr Ishii, the police probe into West Tsucho dis- covered links with Iwama Country Club. From there the trail led to Nomura and Nikko and to a host of dealings in finance and real estate. Among other things, the police found a copy of Mr Ishli's stock portfollo, headed by 1.85m shares in Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steel- maker. Mr Ishli was so successful that other gangsters began to copy him. Last year a company connected to Yamaguchi-gumi cornered stock in Kurabo, a large textiles company, and successfully greenmailed the company. Kurabo confirmed that its affiliates had bought back the stock. Last year's stock market plunge, the collapse of the land boom and tough responses to the scandals by the authorities have forced the yaku= to back off a little from the financial markets. But tough times create their own opportunities. With credit tight, some investment syndicates are being forced to turn for loans to yakuza-related finance companies. Yakuma companies have also been sniffin around the assets of bank- rupt businesses. The penetration of Mr Ishii and other yakuto into the heart of the financial economy begs the ques- tion of why legitimate companies allowed it to happen. After all, yakaza remain criminals, with some 80 per cent of their earnings coming from illegal businesses, much of it from drugs, according to police figures. One reason is fear: gangsters are adept at harassing customers and clients alike. Companies avoid com- plaining to the police because intim- idation is hard to prove under Japa- nese law. Moreover, even though Japanese murder rates are very low in comparison with the US and Europe, the yakuza do not baulk at exacting the maximum penalty even from finance company execu- tives - in 1968 a fund manager who dealt with Yamaguchi-gumi disap- peared and was later found buried in concrete. Also, companies often get drawn into initial contacts with yakuza unwittingly. False names and paper companies are widely used in Japan: it is difficult to identify the real villains among legions of tax, dodgers. Finally, there is a more general question about toleration of gang- sters in Japanese society. Gangster groups have traditionally employed many people whom mainstream businesses turned away, including members of the Korean minority and the burakumin (a caste tradi- tionally associated with dirty jobs). Gambling and prostitution do not tend to be regarded as the worst of crimes. Mr Hiroshi Ishizuki, a police chief superintendent dealing with organ- ised crime, denies that Japanese are tolerant of gangsters, saying 3,000 anti-yakuza campaign groups exist. The cabinet this year approved Japan's first laws specifically ban- ning certain 'gangster activities, including extortion. But the law falls short of what was originally proposed by the police. Crucially, the police will not have the right to confiscate the pro- ceeds of crime, with the exception of drug-related profits - owing to opposition from lawyers concerned about the possible infringement of human rights as guaranteed by the constitution. So yakuza will continue to enjoy the right to make money and flaunt it at events like Mr Ishii's funeral.",

   "text_content" : "Haig Simonian on Benetton's controversial advertising campaigns s it art? A woolly political statement? Shock tactics? Or is the advertising cam- paign by Italy's Benetton clothing group that is causing a stir in Britain and elsewhere a strictly commercially-driven amalgam of all these things? Benetton's poster campaigns - some expressing the joys of human brotherhood, others centred on quirkily arresting images, but none talking about. clothes - have been attracting bemused comment for some time in a number of the 50 or so countries where it adver- tises. This week in Britain puzzle- ment turned into controversy over the company's latest image - a blood-smeared new- born baby, umbilical cord still attached, displayed across the country on full-size roadside posters. The Advertising Stan- dards Authority criticised Benetton on Tuesday for the \"offensive\" poster; Benetton duly obliged by withdrawing the campaign, but promptly said it would go ahead with a series of magazine ads that may prove as contentious - portraying a white child as an angel and a black child with hair combed into horns. What is Benetton ap to? In Treviso, the company's northern hillside home, they do not understand the fuss. The bloody baby has caused little trouble in any of the 50 other countries where it is due to run, says Mr Luciano Benet- ton, its maverick managing director. Mr Benetton has been the brains behind the company's marketing since its birth in the 1960s; with his brothers Gilberto and Carlo and sister Giullana, he has presided over Benetton's rise to become one of Europe's biggest clothing concerns, with sales of L2,060bn (Â£938m) last year and ambitions to double them by the middle of the decade. And in a sense, the uncon- ventional ad campaigns - the pictures conjuring up racial, or multiracial, themes, the nuns kissing priests, the United Colours of Benetton trademark - express Mr Benetton's personality. His shoulder-length hair may be greying now, but the oval glasses and casual clothes still send the message that he is an \"alternative\" tycoon. If he sets the broad philoso- phy behind Benetton's adver- Uting, it is an outsider who has been increasingly respon- sible for delivering the images over the last nine years: a freelance photographer named Oliviero Toscani, who works for the company as a consul- tant and who - thanks to his Benetton ads - has become something of an Italian celeb- rity. As Mr Toscani tells it, Benetton wants to do far more than shift more garments through its international store network. It wants, he says, to make people think. \"We don't have the arrogance to say our products are the best or the cheapest. The idea is to create discussion.\" On the new-born baby pic- ture, Mr Toscani waxes lyrical. Amid so much that is banal, it is pure \"generosity\" of Benet- ton to show \"real\" Images luke a baby's birth, he declares. The umbilical caord reinforces Benetton's \"united\" message. 1 1 I1 I Perhaps so, but images that can shock do have an undenia- ble side-effect that cannot be without commercial interest to the company: they get it talked about. The baby, the nan and priest and the angel and devil children - just three of this season's six images - have already earned Benetton more publicity than a year's paid advertising put together. Such is the mixture that has distinguished Benetton from the start, a combination of innovative thinking and steely business sense. There are, in fact, sound commercial rea- sons for the company to want to depart from the traditional approach of advertising spe- cifie products - the main one being its sheer international scope. To stick to the old ways, the company says, would mean using dozens of models in dif- ferent countries showing just tiny fractions of its interna- tional range, and that would be both boring and Ineffective. Using children of varying eth- nic backgrounds not only fits the message of equality, but also means the same ads can be used worldwide. And keep- ing clothes out of the picture avoids the problem of running a global campaign for what are seasonal products. Thus the current campaign works Just as well in Sidcup gearing up for winter as in Sydney pre- paring for spring. But conveying general \"feel- good\" messages is one thing; producing shock, deliberately or not, quite another. Both Mr Benetton and Mr Toscani deny the latest series of ads deliberately sets out to offend. An advert which causes offence in one market can turn out to be a prize-win- naer in another, they say. They are just as adamant in reject- ing accusations of racism, which have come up following publication of the \"angel and devil\" picture. The UK's Com- mission for Racial Equality and the Advertising Standards Authority have voiced misgiv- ings about the ad, which has also aroused opposition among some black groups in the US. Mr Benetton, Just back from Tokyo, claims he takes sound- ings about national reactions before going ahead with a campaign. But as the ASA pointedly remarked on Tues- day, it had advised Benetton's advertising agency in advance not to proceed with the cam- paign, advice that appears to have gone unheeded. \"I'm sad the trouble arose in the UK, which is notable for its tolerance\", says Mr Tos- cani. Combining the languor of the offended artist with a swipe at Britain's animal-lov- ing reputation, he adds, \"maybe its we'd used a cat or a dog, they wouldn't have minded so much\". Selling clothes or just shocking? A Benetton advertlsenelt ... .. .... . ... ....._ _ But do the ads actually help to sell sweaters? The answer is nobody knows; even Mr Benet- ton cannot say whether the ads are effective In this sense. Mr Toscani denies that has anything to do with the cam- pal in the first place. Two things are certain: the ads provoke comment, and they do not hurt Benetton's bottom line. The moment Mr Benetton finds his company's publicity causing sufficient offence to damage sales it will be changed for good.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board yesterday criticised the approach taken by BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, in picking and choosing from its new accounting standards. It said its proposals should be taken as a whole and not piece- meal. BTR raised its taxable profits in the six months to June by including the Â£90m gain from the recent disposal of its Pretty Polly hosiery business. By taking the profit above the line, BTR showed a 1.2 per cent increase on last year's interim profits, adjusted for currency movements, to Â£512m. If the impact of the disposal were taken out, the pre-tax fig- ure was down 11.2 per cent. Miss Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said: \"Taking disposals above the line is within the new accounting cli- mate. Companies are now going in that direction.\" Under the ASB's proposals the distinction between extraordinary or exceptional would in effect be removed, and almost all unusual costs or revenues would have to be taken above the line, affecting earnings per share. Professor David Tweedie, ASB chairman, yesterday told the Financial Times that the whole point behind his propos- als was that there should be no item above the line that could artificially inflate the profits from one year to another. He explained that his propos- als taken as a whole were designed to ensure that there rroiessor IRweeuie a case ui cnerry pLmaUIS I would be nothing above the line which had to be scrutin- ised. He said: \"The problem at the moment is that companies take the good things, like dis- posals above the line, and the bad (like restructuring costs) below the line. \"It sounds to me as if BTR are taking the best from the proposals, and leaving out the bits they don't like. A case of cherry picking.\" BTR was criticised by ana- lysts for acquiring Polly Peck's hosiery business under one set of accounting practices and then disposing of it under another. However, Miss O'Don- ovan stressed that taking the gain from the disposal above the line was within accepted accounting practices. Professor Tweedie made it clear that while he had not seen BTR's accounts, the new accounting standards. were designed to prevent, not allow, a company to increase profits from a one-off item. Apart from taking all trans- actions above the line, compa- nies would also be expected to give much more detail about the nature of its profits. Professor Tweedie said: \"Under our proposals compa- nies would also have to show if the profit and loss account was affected by any unusual items associated with the business. \"They would also be expec- ted to give shareholders all the information needed for them to be able to know what the busi- ness should be making the fol- lowing year if nothing out of the ordinary happens.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay LAIRD, the car parts, plastics and building products group, yesterday reported a 33 per cent fall in profits as the reces- sion hit auto sales. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June fell from Â£21.58m to Â£14.36m on sales marginally higher at Â£255.7m. The costs of simultaneously opening two new auto sealing system plants in Germany and Spain and redundancies took 52.5m off profits already hit by lower car'-sales in France, the UK and the US. Earnings per share fell from 13p to 8.6p, but the interim div- idend is maintained at 4p. Mr John Gardiner, the chair- man, Isaid model launches for the new Golf Volkswagen and Opel Kadett, which will both have been launched by Noven- ber, will boost profits from rub- ber door seals in the German market, where Laird is the largest supplier. Trading profits in sealing systems fell from Â£10.2m to Â£6.7m, while in industrial prod- ucts which are also mainly auto-related, they fell from Â£8m to Â£6.3m. Profits were unchanged at Â£5.3m in the non-auto part of the group, which accounts for 45 per cent of sales. The group still faces a high 42 per cent tax charge as profit- ability in the UK, which accounts for 20 per cent of group sales, has been hit by the recession. * COMMENT After a sometimes unhappy journey through a string of old-fashioned engineering industries, Laird is on an alto- gether rosier track. The auto industry may cause shivers in the UK, but Laird's experience elsewhere in Europe has been enviable. With the two big Ger- man car launches, which will increase volume and eventu- ally margins, the group has at least two excellent years growth ahead of it. The only question is whether the market may have already over-egged the share price. A full-year profits forecast of Â£28.5m, giv- ing earnings of 17p, leads to a prospective multiple of 16 times. Even with little eco- nomic recovery the introduc- tion of the new Kadett and Golf models should lead to profits of at least Â£36m, giving earnings of 22p.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger A SHARP downturn in the new car market cut interim pre-tax profits at Perry Group, the leading UK motor vehicle retailer, by 50 per cent to Â£l.lm. Turnover fell just 11 per cent to Â£154.1m in the six months to June 30. New car sales, which accounted for 50 per cent of turnover, came to 7,642. How- ever, Mr Richard Allan, chair- man, said no operating profit was made in this area. \"Ihere were too many cars chasing too few customers,\" he said. Mr Allan said that, in future, Perry intended to reduce its dependence on Ford dealer- ships. Ford has suffered a steadily declining share of the UK new car market which is forecast to fall from 2m in 1990 to about 1.5m in 1991. Mr Allan said that all parts of the business, with the excep- tion of new cars, had per- formed satisfactorily. Used car sales rose by 15 per cent, while the repairs and parts busi- nesses were strong. Earnings per share dropped to 4p (7.9p), but the interim dividend was held at 2.75p.",

   "text_content" : "Raymond Snoddy talks to James Gatward and hears his version of the storm in TVS' cup R JAMES Gatward, founder and former chief executive of TVS Entertainment, yesterday accused the television com- pany of over-paying in an attempt to retain its franchise. TVS, which holds the ITV franchise for the south and south-east of ,England, announced last month that it had bid Â£54.1m in current prices - nearly Â£60m in the 1993 prices required for the competitive tenders for new 10- year franchises. \"I find the level of the bid totally incomprehensible,\" said Mr Gatward, who was cen- trally involved in the prepara- tions for the franchise bid before he was dismissed in February by Mr Rudolph Agnew, the new TVS chair- man. To. be apparently prepared to over-pay for the licence by some Â£200m of shareholders' money [over 10. years), an action not pressured by the recession in any way, shows a lack of judgment which should at the very least have been thrown out by shareholders,\" said Mr Gatward. He was speaking for the first time since his abrupt dismiseal by Mr Agnew, the former chairman of Colidated Gold- fields. Mr Gatward, who rose through the ranks of the televi- sian Industry from being a stage-hand at the BBC to a diator ofUM bit series such mUm ?he Trb's I mnI thnks that hay dthimH at TS ani now bein traken by peple wib hUue mpdtine atwvl Ham-m TSMi d3w '-- >.^S-'t :Â£Â«)----' plan (a confidential and sepa- rate part of the application for the licence) that it will have real annual advertising growth of 5.7 per cent between 1993 and 1997, is too optimistic. The former chief executive says that the Independent Tele vision Commission, the indus- try regulatory body, now faces a difficult decision: how to judge what he believes could be \"a marginal business plan\" put forward by TVS to justify its high bid. The troubles of Mr Gatward and TVS date from the $320m acquisition in July 1988 of :.TM, the US independent pro- duction company responsible for programmes such as Lou Grant, Hill Street Blues and, more recently, the award-win- ning Evening Shade which stars Burt Reynolds. Soon after the acquisition the US syndication market went into decline and at the same time buyers started to prefer half-hour shows rathi than TM's stock in trade - n hour programmes. MTM's resulting finandal problems led to TVS' anmoumnement in May of pre tax losses of Sn3m, a suspe- iam of rthei dvidend par t and the writingoff of the US vestment.

Mr Gatward says that on Monday he was told by Mr Agnew: \"The whole board is behind me. We are summarily dismissing you.\" When asked why, Mr Gat- ward says Mr Agnew replied: \"Because you are greedy and you like living high on the hog.\" Mr Agnew also said that Mr Gatward was not a team player. It was a jolt. I had taken the smack on the face - the demo- tion - but I was not prepared for dismissal,\" says Mr Gat- ward. However he did accept a 5100,000 pay-of. Mr Agnew has since pri- vately said that one reason for Mr Gatward's dismissal was the suggestion in the strategy review that other senior execu- tives should eventually be replaced. Laut week at an etraordi- nary general meeting to auprove a capital restructuring o TVS, Mr Agnew attacked what he described as i-in- formed criticism of the TVS advertising assumptions.

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox SALOMON BROTHERS, the US investment bank which was the global co-ordinator for the May flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers, acknowledged yesterday that it lost up to Â£Sm through trading MGN shares. MGN, Mr Robert Maxwell's UK newspaper group, was floated at 125p a share but the price has slipped steadily to its present 102p. Salomon, which is reeling from recent disclosures that it rigged US Treasury auctions, said that the firm's market makers had bought shares soon after the float as part of its obligation to provide liquidity in the shares. The Mirror share price came under heavy selling pressure at the flotation. Some UK institutions were worried by the warning given a month earlier from Maxwell Communications Corp, another public company in Mr Maxwel's media empire, that its pre-tax profits for the year to March 1991 would be lower than the previous year's Â£172m. Salomon officials said, how- ever, that subsequent trading had recouped part of their losses. Salomon's advisory fee for the flotation is also believed to be between Elm and Â£2m."

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen, investment correspondent Shares in CLF Yeoman were suspended yesterday and the company said it had been unable to reach agreement with its banks to restructure Â£39m in loans. It is in talks with its advisers over its posi- tion. The Irish leasing company said it has been unable to sell its CLF Holdings subsidiary, which it bought in December 1988 for Â£88.1m, and had decided the holding now had no value. The company has been attempting to sell its CLF sub- sidiary since December last year. The loans were part of the Â£93m in debt incurred when Yeoman, a leasing group based in Dublin, bought CLF, a small ticket leasing company with operations in the UK and France. At the suspension price of 30p the company is capitalised at Â£16.3m. In August 1990, CLF Yeo- man brought legal proceedings against SG Warburg and the law firm Linklaters and Payne, which advised it on the purchase of CLF. The company sought to recover Â£60m. Yeoman refused to pay Link- later's fees and asked for a return of fees paid to War- burg. It said its advisers should have alerted it to potential problems in one of CLF's subsidiaries, Technology for Business, which incurred a Â£12m loss soon after the acqui- sition.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Boardroom Upheaval Continues at Greencore over Disclosure",
   "text_content" : "THE Greencore shareholding scandal claimed another casu- alty last night following the resignation of Mr Michael 1ully as company secretary and general manager of finance, writes Peggy Hollin- ger. Mr Tully is the second senior executive to quit Greencore, one of Ireland's leading agri- businesses, in under a week. His replacement is Mr Ralph MacDarby, managing director of the Secretarial Trust Com- pany, as company secretary. Mr Michael McGrail, a partner in Coopers & Lybrand had been seconded to Greencore as financial controller. The board is believed to be reviewing the position of at least one more senior execu- tive. Mr Christopher Comerford, chief executive and 28-year vet- eran of the company, quit on Wednesday following allega- tions in the Irish press of his undisclosed interest in a com- pany acquired when Greencore was fully under state control. Greencore - now 45 per cent owned by the state - was floated on the Irish stock mar- ket in April this year, the first big sell-off in the government's informal privatisation pro- gramme. The affair has cast a cloud over those plans how- ever, and a review of disclo- sure rules is almost certain to be carried out before further sell-offs. In Greencore's flotation pro- spectus, there was no mention of Mr Comerford's alleged indi- rect beneficial interest in Sugar Distributors (Holdings), the sugar distribution group. SDH was bought outright by Irish Sugar, as Greencore was known before flotation, in Feb- ruary 1990. It has now been alleged that the beneficial interest was not held by Mr Comerford - who has in court stated that he was the beneficial owner through a holding company called Tal- mino - but by his adult chil- dren. Official sources said yes- terday that although technically this would clear Mr Comerford of commiting. any regulatory breach, there were still questions to be answered. The affair has kept Ireland's financial and political commu- nities in a state of turmoil for the last week as the intricacies of share dealings in SDH have come to light. In 1975 Irish Sugar bought a 51 per cent stake in SDH. The remaining 49 per cent was held by two food distribution com- panies and two SDH executives - Mr Charles Garavan and Mr Thomas Keleghan. SDH was Irish Sugar's sole marketing arm, and, in the words of one Dublin analyst, became the powerhouse of its growth during the 1980s. In the year to September 1989, SDH had turnover of about IE100m compared to Irish Sugar's IE216m. SDH was responsible for all of Irish Sugar's sugar sales in the Republic and a\"nNorthern Ireland. By 1990, sugar accounted for twb-thirds of Irish Sugar's total group prof- its of IE21m. In March 1989, a holding company called Gladebrook bought the 49 per cent of SDH for IÂ£1.6m cash and I1.6m in dividend payments, Glade- brook was partly owned by four SDH executives - Mr Gar- avan, Mr Keleghan and Mr Charles Lyons - each with 21.51 per cent - and Mr Tully with 11.22 per cent. Jersey- based Talmino held the bal- ance. Mr Comerford is cur- rently disputing the ownership of Talmino. Eleven months later, that same 49 per cent was sold to Irish Sugar for IÂ£8.6m in loan notes payable to Mr Tully, Mr Keleghan, Mr Lyons, Mr Gara- van, and Talmino. The four executives disclosed their interests to Irish Sugar at the time. Mr Richard Hooper, of Investment Bank of Ireland and adviser to Irish Sugar's purchase, maintained yester- day that Irish Sugar had paid a fair amount. \"The company's profits during those 11 months increased by 2.5 times,\" he said. However, official sources have suggested that such a large return on the executives' original investment should raise questions regarding the contractual relationship between SDH and Irish Sugar.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller THE SHARE price of Alexandra Workwear, a maker and distributor of work clothes, fell more than 10 per cent yesterday after the com- pany warned that it had only broken even in the first half of the year. The slump in performance compares with Â£4.lm pre-tax in the 28 weeks to August 18 last year, although the deteriora- tion was already clear in the second half when only Â£2.5m was added. Alexandra said summer trad- ing had been lower than expec- ted in the UK and France. Pre- tax profit would also be hit by a Â£1.5m exceptional charge for closing a Scottish factory, including provision for more than 300 redundancies. For the year as a whole, ana- lysts' forecasts had already been cut from more than Â£6m and the latest downgradings are to roughly Elm. Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said that apart from the exceptional costs, the profit drop was related to a cut in volume. He admitted the group might have been unduly opti- mistic in believing it was reces- sion-resistant. SThe difficult trading meant that the reduction of Â£16m year-end debt had been slowed down. Gearing was likely to fall to 60 (69) per cent by next February, whereas 50 per cent had been hoped for. Consider- able progress had been made on cutting stock by Â£6m and capital spending would only amount to Â£500,000 (Â£6.5m). The share price closed down 16p at 137p, close to this rear's low of 128p. Two directors, John and Mary Prior, sold shares at 175p last October.",

Suggestions that Lord Weinstock, 67, might retire had helped boost GEC's share price from its opening level of 194p last Monday to 201p by the close on Thursday. Lord Prior, chairman, told GEC's annual gen- eral meeting: \"The directors are unanimous in their support for Lord Weinstock and his team.\" GEC's shares closed at 199p yesterday, down 2p. Mr Simon Weinstock, Lord Weinstock's son, was re-elected a director with only one dissent- ing vote. Lord Weinstock has said he would like his son to succeed him. There was no direct criticism of Lord Wein- stock from the meeting, although several share- holders complained about the performance of GEC's shares. One asked why the share price only rose when it was rumoured that senior figures might step down. Lord Prior said that during the first four months of the current year, profits were margin- ally higher than the same period last year on a similar level of sales. He said the group was disappointed that its joint bid with British Aerospace to manage pro- duction of new helicopters for the Royal Navy had been rejected in favour of one from IBM of the US and Westland, the UK-based helicopter manufacturer.

   "article_dc_title" : "Yuen Resigns as Head of Hong Kong Exchange",
   "text_content" : "By Angus Souter in Hong Kong MR FRANCIS Yuen, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will step down next month to become chief executive of Hang Chong Investment, the trading and agency group which is being taken over by a consortium led by Citic Pacific. His resignation will add to the uncertainty surrounding the exchange, which is in dis- pute with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) over an enforced reform pack- age designed to bring it in line with international standards. Sir QW Lee, chairman of the exchange, is expected to retire at the end of the year while Mr Philip Wong, the former first vice chairman, was forced to step down earlier this year fol- lowing a controversy over spe- cial share allocations. Mr Yuen said he felt it was time for him to do something different. \"My background is in merchant banking and stock broking. Hang Chong is per- haps the biggest private trad- ing company in Hong Kong and, together with Citic, I think there is tremendous potential for growth,\" he said. The appointment is another sign that Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Bei- jing's main overseas invest- ment vehicle, China Interna- tional Trust and Investment, is Yuen: will join Hang Chong Investment emerging as China's first \"hong\" or trading conglomer- ate. Although only 39, Mr Yuen has had a high profile career and is widely regarded as able. Indirectly, he will be rejoin- ing two former colleagues, Mr Philip Tose and Mr Francis Lueng. All three left Citicorp three years ago. Mr Yuen went to the stock exchange while the others set up Peregrine, a fast-growing merchant bank which,holds an 8 per cent stake in the Citic Pacific-led consortium. Mr Yuen's record at the stock exchange s mixed 'and he was rumoured to have been looking for another job for some time. He had said he intended to work for the exchange for \"three to five years\". Earlier this. year he agreed to stay on at the exchange upon the expiry of a three-year contract next month but that has now changed. Mr Yuen was the exchange's first independent chief execu- tive. He was brought-in to sep- arate the exchange's manage- inent from its ruling council. This was in the wake of the chairmanship of Mr Ronald Li, now in jail for corruption, who closed the exchange for four days during the 1987 global crash. Although the exchange's rep- utation has improved under Mr Yuen, he failed to push through a voluntary reform package last month. This was designed to remove the last remaining practices - such as voting by prpxy - that were seen as open to abuse follow- ing the 1987 closure. Failure to implement the vol- untary package led the SFC to impose harder-hitting mea- sures which are due to come into force next year.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew HIII in Brussels BELGIUM'S largest independent airline was yester- day forced to seek court protec- tion from its creditors, some of which have threatened to go directly to the airline's clients for repayment of their debts. Trans European Airways (TEA) said that one creditor, Eurocontrol - the pan-Euro- pean air traffic control body - had impounded a TEA aircraft at London's Gatwick airport. TEA, which only won the right to operate scheduled flights between Brussels and Gatwick in June, was last night seeking a legal injunc- tion against Eurocontrol's action. TEA, owned by the family o its founder and president Mr Georges Gutelman, is also negotiating with other air- lines and potential investors. Mr Alain Zenner, the group's lawyer, said yesterday: \"We are now bound to consider a takeover or at least investment by another airline.\" The company said its operations would contihue as usual, but it has asked the Liege commercial court for a \"composition procedure\" - the Belgian equivalent of Chapter 11 protection in the US - to cover four group companies, including the holding company and the airline subsidiary. The court meets on Monday to consider the case. TEA has an annual turnover of about BFrl5bn ($419m), but has been trading at a loss for the last two years.. The four companies covered by the creditor protection scheme have liabilities of BFr2.94bn, excluding intra- roup loans. Of this total, BFr975 is owed to suppliers and BFrl.84bn to banks. The airline refused to say which creditors had threat- ened to recover their debts. The group was already con- sidering a restructuring plan which could involve alterna- tive financing for its fleet, refo. cusing on its core aviation business with the help of a partner, and the sale of its maintenance and tourism activities. Mr Marc Uilenbroeck, TEA's finance director, said last night that the creditor protection scheme was bound to cause some uncertainty in the mar- ket. But he added: \"Our hope is that once we get this restructuring plan in place we can convince the travel community that things are secure.\" The group had also appealed to the regional Flemish author- ities in Belgium for a BFr3.6bn injection of cash. However, the regional investment authority said yes- terday. following an emergency meeting, that it was not the Flemish government's policy to grant straight subsi- dies. TEA had hoped to emulate its principal rival, Sabena, the state-controlled airline which has received a BFrS5bn pack- age of aid from the Belgian government. TEA was founded 20 years ago by Mr Gutelman as a pure charter operation, and is likely to be one of the main beneficia- ries of the EC's aviation liber- alisation package.",

   "text_content" : "By Halg SImnla n in Milan MR GIORGIO Armani, the Italian designer best known for his stylish high.fashlon cloth- ing lines, expects sales this year to fall by around 5 .per cent to L7Sobn,($Ws.7m'). Mr Armin., who is launch- ing a new retailing initiative in the US, said net profits for his privately-owned group looked set to decline by a similar per- centage. Net earnings last year had been $54.2m, he revealed. Mr Armani denied that the neir chain, called Armani Exchange (A/X), represented a reaction to the more difficult US trading climate for luxury goods producers. However, he attributed the expected fall in group sales this year princi- pally to the tougher economic conditions in a number of key markets. \"We have been thinking about this for two years,\" said Mr Armani who claimed that new line was not so much a move downmarket as a desire to make Armani wear available to a new range of customers. \"We want to construct a cli- entele which lasts for the. flitre,\" he said. Much of the new range, com- priping mainly jeans and casal wear, will sell for under $100. That is appreciably below the prices in the existing Armani high-fashion boutiques and even the slightly cheaper Emporio Armani stores. The new chain will be owned and operated by Simint, the quoted Italian clothing manu- facturer in which Mr Armani owns a 20 per cent stake. Sim- int's controlling shareholder is Mr Francesco Micheli, the Milan financider. Simint, which already pro- duces much Armani label apparel, is expected later this month to report net profits of over L17bn for its 199091 sinan- cial year. Setting up the new chain is expected to involve an investment of around $30m over the next two to three years, according to Mr Armani. The group expects first year retail sales of $60m. Armani: the designer plan to open a new retamnnag canm U The first A/A store is due to open in New York before the end of this year, with further outlets in another five US cities by the end of 1992. Addi- tional sales points will be developed in conjunction with existing department stores. Mr Armani said the new chain would relieve space in the existing Emporio Annani outlets in the US, which would then bq able to concentrate on more seasonal and fashion-con- scious designs. By contrast, items in the new range will have much lon- ger production runs, and are more likely to be manufactured in low-cost centres such as south-east Asia.",

   "text_content" : "By Steven Butlter in Tokyo NIPPON Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, yesterday issued a warning that its pre-tax prof- its would fall by 80 per cent to Y55bn ($406m) in the six months to end-September. The company blamed the steep fall in earnings on the rising costs of iron ore, labour and distribution. Nippon, whose profits fell by 20.5 per cent last year, had warned in May that it expec- ted to see a decline in pre-tax profits of 25 per cent for the entire year. The company said that in the face of the deceleration of the Japanese economy, demand for steel had remained firm. Its sales in the first half of the fiscal year were expec- ted to show a small decline to Y1,300bn. The company warned that sales were expected to con- tinue declining in the second half of the year and that prof- its were expected to be under severe pressure even though it had negotiated increases in steel prices. A cost-cutting programme was to be implemented in the second half of the year. In spite of the expected decline in profits, Nippon Steel hopes to maintain its interim dividend unchanged at TY a share."

   "text_content" : "By Ronald van de Krol In Amsterdam HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, lifted net profit by less than 1.8 per cent in the first half of 1991, as the Gulf war, poor summer weather and economic recession reduced beer sales. Net profit totalled F1168.38m ($86.3m) in the six months to end-June. Sales, measured in litres of beer sold, fell by an unspecified amount, but group turnover rose by slightly more than 1 per cent to F14.2bn. The company said: \"Not only were the weather conditions in Europe unfavourable, but also the Gulf crisis had a negative influence on sales in many countries, owing to a decline in visits to restaurants and cafes and tourism.\" Heineken, the world's third largest beer group, forecast that net profit would match, or be slightly higher than, its 1990 results, when net earnings climbed by 12.4 per cent to F1365.7m. The 1991 forecast does not include an estimated Fi60m in after-tax extraordinary income which is expected to be real- ised in the second half through the sale of land in Singapore by Asia Pacific Breweries, which is 42.5 per cent-owned by the Dutch group. Heineken's interim dividend for 1991 was left unchanged at F11.50. Although beer sales were down, Heineken's mar- gins rose because of higher sales prices and lower person- nel costs achieved through reorganisations at several of its subsidiaries. The 2 per cent increase in operating profit to F1296m was due in part to the first-time consolidation of Heineken's long-standing US importer Van Munching & Co, which was aequired in late 1990. Dividends from non-consoli- dated participations showed a sharp increase, to Fl10.2m from E13.6m a year earlier. Heineken said the large rise was due mainly to the fact that several associate companies had transferred their payouts earlier in the year than usual.",

In the last quarter, the com- pany reported a decline in net profit to C$45m (US$39.5m) or 52 cents a share, from C$48m or 55 cents in the correspond- ing period of 1990. Sales were little changed at C$1.3bn. The dividend is being raised from 19.5 cents a share to 20 dents. In the first quarter ended July 31, Labatt increased its domestic beer market share to 42.6 per cent from 41.8 per cent a year earlier. * Laurentian Bank of Can- ada, part of the Laurentian Financial Services Group, achieved an 8 per cent gain in third-quarter profit with strength in its core retail busi- ness. Profit was C$9.2m or 56 cents a share in the July quar- ter. against 88.6m or 50 cents.",

The final price will depend in part on progress made in PGTs planned US$1.7bn expan- sion of its 050km pipeline. The project, which involves dou- bling the existing pipeline, is due to come on stream in 1993. However, it faces competition from the Altamont consortium, which is proposing a more easterly route. The acquisition, expected to be completed early next year, Includes PGT's 49 per cent stake in Alberta Natural Gas, which has various gas distribu- tion and extraction facilities in western Canada, as well as a specialised chemicals business. TCPL is also discussing with PG&E the purchase of Alberta and Southern Gas, a gas sup- ply broker which has contracts with 190 producers in Alberta. The proposed purchase is another sign of the growing presence of Canadian natural gas in the US. TCPL is already the largest shareholder in the Iroquois Gas Transmission Sys- tem, a consortium which is in the midst of a C$2.4bn project to bring natural gas from Alberta to the north-east US. Canada's share of the US natural gas market is expected to rise to about 10 per cent from 7 per cent currently.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkidn in Paris BSN, the French food group, is to expand its Interests in pre- pared ..leals by buying the Spanish leader in the sector. The group says it will com- plete by the middle of this month the purchase of Pycasa, a subsidiary of the US food giant General Mills. This is the only rozen pre- pared meal business owned in Europe by General Mills, which is refocusing its activi- ties in the region, with the con- struction' of a savoury snacks factory in the Netherlands and its agreement two years ago to produce breakfast cereals with Nestl6, the Swiss food multina- tidial. Pycasa's Cocinera brand has a 22 per cent share of the Span- ish market for frozen prepared meals, which is the fastest growing segment of Spain's food market, said BSN. The purchase price is not being disclosed, though Pycasa last year reported sales of Pta7.0Bbn ($65m) and employs 460 people at its factory in Tor- Mreon, near Madrid."

A low Of DM.1280 as touched on news that August non-arm payrolls rose 34,000, against a revised fall of 73,000 in July, but the currency recovered as dealers decided' that the figures were unlikely to prompt an immediate easing of the Federal Reserve's mone- tary stance. Although forecasts varied quite widely the published data came as little surprise to most analysts. The general view was that the figures are consistent with a sluggish economic recovery.

The Bank of England initially forecast a credit shortage of 2900m on the cash market, but revised this to 1,100m at noon and to 21,200m in the afternoon. Total help of Â£1,068m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought t757 bills outright, by way of 5mi Treasury bills in band 1 at 10% per cent and t7iba bank bills in band I at 10% per cent. In the afternoon another Igm bank bills were purchased outright, in band I at 10% per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of.

   "text_content" : "The latest published opinion poll, tiving the Conservative Party a 4.5 per cent lead over Labour, provided the impetus for another sustained upward drive by the utilities sectors of the market. Water and electric- ity stocks, among the equity market's best performers this week, were notably strong. Many of the City's big insti- tutions moved heavily into the water stocks this week, antici- pating a general election in November and re-election of the Conservative Party. Demand for the water stocks tended to be 'focused on the Elbn-plus stocks included in the Footsie index. \"They're liq- uid stocks, easily traded and very attractive, with good yields and a consistent earn- ings flow,\" said one specialist. He said at least one big insti- tution had been switching its remaining holdings out of the smaller, less liquid water stocks, and into the Footsie stocks. Anglian rose 4 to 401p, leaving the shares up 29 over the week. Over the week North West were 20 ahead, Severn Trent up 32 and Thames 24 firmer. Regional electricity stocks continued to move ahead, responding to a big buy note from Kleinwort Benson; The broker -recommended the Elec- tricity Package, up 45 to Â£2208, Manweb, 5 stronger at 261p, South Wales, 10 higher at 262p, London, 9 better at 221p and Yorkshire, 3 harder at 244p. Rolls cheer News of an order worth Â£250m cheered Rolls-Royce, the shares adding 5 to 143p. Turn- over rose to ilm shares after Thai Airways said it had cho- sen Rolls' new Trent engine to power six new Boeing 777s it has ordered. The airline has taken options on a further six aircraft. The market was relieved that Rolls had found a launch customer for its Trent engine on the 777 series. There was, however, some speculation that the company may have had to lower its margins to win the order. Market sentiment towards Rolls has been cool since Brit- ish Airways announced more than two weeks ago that it was to buy rival engines made by General Electric, of the US, to power its newly-ordered fleet of Boeing 777s. Mr Peter Deigbthon, at County NatWest said: This is a neat reversal of the stuation of two weeks ago when BA bought GE engines. It i* impor- tant that Rolls launches on Boeing's big plane.\" However, after brisk buying early in the session, US sellers of Rolls-Royce stock were noted in the afternoon. Glaxo active A re-evaluation of jGlaxo's estimated full-year' profits, which are to be annou.ced on Thursday, helped the shares to gain 16 to 1881p. Mr James Culverwell of securities, house Hoare Govett raised his predic- tion for the company by Â£88m to Â£1,250m. Also, the phares continued to benefit from a hefty review by Lehman Brothers of the world plharma- ceutical market. The review, published earlier this 'week, highlights Glaxo as one jos the top global performers Within the next ten years.

Although SmithKline rejected the reports yesterday, buyers backed away in London after at least one large invest- ment fund sold stock in New York. The shares fell 8 to 789p. Observers said the shares may also have been affected by expectations of good results from SmithKline's rival, Glaxo, which are published on Thurs- day. Among brewers, recent talk of a bid for Allied-Lyons faded and the shares gave up 7 to 612p. Profit-taking was encour- aged by advice from UBS Phillips & Drew to switch out of Allied and into Whitbread \"A\", up a penny at 500p. Profit-taking and suggestions that Vaux may buy Brent Walker's brewing interests weakened the shares 6 to 234p. Among engineers, Simon Engi- neering shed 4 to 329p after a Smith New Court profits down- grade. The securities house shaved the current year fore- cast by Â£38.2m to Â£25.8n and the following year's figure was cut by Â£3.5m to Â£31.5m. Smith said the recovery in the company's markets was \"muted\". British Aerospace shrugged off recent talk of a rights issue. The shares added 6 to 555p as turnover rose to 1.8m. Interim figures are due next week. Laird Group added 7 to 279p after reporting half-time fig- ures ahead of market forecasts. Interim profits fell from Â£21.6m to Â£14.3m. Smiths Industries firmed 7 to 294p in sympathy with Rolls-Royce. Renewed speculation that Asda is to announce senior boardroom changes boosted turnover to 12m as the shares added a penny to 98p. The lat- est suggestion was that an executive from Tesco would join Asda as managing direc- tor, although analysts doubted this. Food specialists believed the supermarket group was more likely to announce a new chairman first. Housebuilding stocks, which have long suffered from high interest rates, were among the stock market's best performers yesterday, responding to the latest cut in UK interest rates. Beazer, expected to release details of the flotation of its non-US interests very soon, and in receipt of some strong American buying after the UK interest rate cut was said to have increased its flotation price, jumped 4% to 98%p. Sheltered homes developer McCarthy & Stone jumped 5% to 80%p, while troubled prop- erty group Falrbrlar almost doubled in price, closing a net 3% up at 7'%p. Ratners added 4 to 140p and continued to attract interest before its interim results on September 16 with the sugges- tion that it may have to buy in 17m shares for its employee pension scheme. There have also been suggestions that it will announce a pension holi- day. Reckddtt & Colman continued to be affected by its gloomy post interim results meeting with analysts on Thursday. The shares slid 10 to 711p. BP underperformed the mar- ket to close 2 off at 346p. The stock was again restrained by a note published by the oil team at Strauss Turnbull. Strauss's 77-page document assessed the value of BP's recently announced Cusiana discovery in Colombia as being \"no more than 5.3p a share,\" and the value to BP of its Mars discovery in the Gulf of Mexico as \"no more than 1.5p a share.\" British Land was unchanged at 312p as 3.5m shares were issued to pay for an office building bought by the com- pany in Reading, south FT.A All-Share Index 1I0C 1200C usc Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (milHon) Exckudng: Inra-mnaatbudln-i & Omwr turnmir 600 400 200 0 England.

   "text_content" : "STOCK INDEX futures continued to be influenced by political factors yesterday as traders took their cue from the lastest opinion ppll which put the ruling Conservative party ahead of the opposition Labour party, writes Jim McCallum. Although the poll gave an overall boost to the market, the growing awareness that a general election may be called this year also created unease and this occasionally led to unexpected setbacks. Investors took the opportu- nity caused by this growing uncertainty to begin to unwind large stock trades hedged in the futures market. Whenever the September FT-SE contract approached fair value, there was buying of futures and selling of shares. September FT-SE closed at 2,686, up 4 points on the day, while its premium to the cash index closed unchanged at 19. Traded options had a quieter session. The equity market's rise generated more interest in calls. The strength in Rolls-Royce shares triggered selling of September 140 calls. Sears 80 and 100 calls were also an active market, while in Amstrad there was buying of December 50 calls. Tesco 260 and 280 calls and British Air- ways 180 calls were an options market feature.",

   "text_content" : "Well Street The Federal Reserve kept mon- etary policy steady in the wake of a modest rise in employment totals yesterday, leaving inves- tors disappointed and share prices virtually unchanged, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 2.91 at. 3,011.41. The more broadly based Standard & Poors 500 weakened slightly, BRAZIL rose 5.6 per cent on interest rate hopes yester- day, hitting a record high at the end of floor trading. The Bovespa index in dollar terms gained 0.03 to 0.57. easing 0.04 to 389.10, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter issues edged 0.01 higher to 516.94. NYSE vol- ume was 168m shares. Before the opening, all eyes were on the August employ- ment numbers which, when released, showed a rise in non- farm payrolls of 34,000 and an unchanged unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent. The data were in line with expectations, and failed to spur the Fed into cut- ting the discount rate. Although analysts are not ruling out the possibility of an easing in policy in coming weeks, the lack of a move yes- terday disappointed investors. The bond market, however, took a more positive view of the employment numbers. In late trading the benchmark 30- year Treasury bond was up B at 1016, yielding 8.011 per cent, while the two-year note was up % at 1006, yielding 6.238 per cent. Among individual issues, there was an order imbalance in UAL owing to a queue of sellers. When the shares opened after a brief delay, they fell quickly to end the session down $3% at $127% on volume of 3m shares. The sell-off followed cuts in earnings estimates for the air- line by a group of Wall Street analysts, on the news that the amount of revenue that UAL has been earning on each passenger milp remains weak. Other big airline stocks were troubled by the UAL decline, with AMR, parent of American Airlines, falling $% to $56%, USAir easing % to .$11%, and Delta slipping $% to $64. American Express fell $% to $26% in active trading as investors reacted to news that the groups investment banking subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Brothers, had suspended two senior executives in the equity department as part of an inves- tigation into improper trading of ConAgra shares. ConAgra, which has been paid $550,000 by Shearson because of the affair, fell $% to $46. Pfizer jumped $2% to $68 on 1.3m shares after a spokesman said that the company had received an \"approvable letter\" from the Food and Drug Administration for Zithroma, its antibiotic drug, and that it was now in discussions over labelling. Analysts expect the drug to receive full approval before the epd of this year. Canada TORONTO share prices ended mixed in light trading. The composite index rose 2.81 points to close at 3488.3. Declines led advances by 278 to 252 on volume of 23.8m shares, up from yesterday's 22.2m. TransCanada PipeLines, off C$% to C$16%, said it had signed a letter of intent to acquire Pacific Gas Transmis- sion, a unit of Pacific Gas and Electric, for between C$330m and CS400m. SOUTH AFRICA SPECULATIVE demand for quality shares lifted Johannes- burg yesterday. The continued shortage of scrip also pushed prices higher, although vol- ume was thin. The industrial index rose 46 to a record 4,189, passing the previous peak of August 14, as Sasol jumped another R1.10 or 6.8 per cent to R17.25 on its recent annual results. The all- gold index gained 9 to 1,163 as bullion prices edged higher.",

   "text_content" : "WEAKNESS ON Wall Street wiped out an early French gain yesterday. Most bourses, other than in Scandinavia, finished the week little changed, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS reached a day's high of 1,874.98 on the CAC 40 index, before closing 8.28 lower at 1,860.39. The index rose 0.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate after Thursday's FFr2.7bn. Lafarge Coppde, the cement maker, fell FFrl5 or 4.1 per cent to FFr354.50 in volume of 212,830 shares. A Paris broker issued a sell recommendation on the stock, while Thursday's news of a sharp fall in interim profits at Blue Circle of the UK hurt sentiment in the sector. Among other losers, Peugeot lost FFrl2 to FFr602 on com- ments by the finance director, while Michelin shed FFr4.30 to FFrl20.60 on profit-taking. LVMH fell FFr39 to FFr4,061 in 42,510 shares as the Vuitton family confirmed the sale of 400,000 shares, or 2.4 per cent, of the luxury goods group, to Goldman Sachs. Fives Lille leapt FFr31 to FFr315 in 195,050 shares. The stock has risen 24 per cent in two days, following the holding FT-S MurIotrack 100 - Sep 6 Hourly OchmnSg Open 10 am It am Noon 1pm 2 pm 3 pm Cbkw 1127.46 1127.42 1126.03 1125.32 1125.43 1125.25 1124.22 1124.68 Day's High 1127.80 Day's Low 1122.77 Sep 5 Sep 4 Sep 3 Sep 2 Aug 30 1126.92 1125.48 1128.91 1126.81 1125.84 Bws value 1000 (26/010). company's profits forecast. CSEE, the electronics com- pany, was suspended at Thurs- day's closing FFr168.20, as Quadral bid FFrl50 for the shares it does not own. FRANKFURT, depressed and flat, sought solace in a little more speculation as Hoesch, Klockner-Werke and Thyssen put on DM6.20 to DM306.50, DM1.70 to DM150 and DM2.90 to DM241.20, respectively. Mr Adrian Phillips, head of European research at Klein- wort Benson, said that this suggested a move on cyclical recovery situations by inves- tors frightened of being left behind when the European industrial economy turns. Other stocks to move included Degussa, the chemi- cals and metals group, which rose DM8.10 to DM339.50. The DAX index closed 0.99 lower at 1,646.18 after a 1.43 rise to 683.00 in the FAZ at midsession. Falls on the week were 0.3 and 0.4 per cent respectively. Volume rose from DM2.9bn to DM3bn. AMSTERDAM edged higher, as short-covering and selective buying of international blue chips outweighed a disappoint- ing inflation figure for August. The CBS tendency index rose 0.1 to 92.6, a gain of 1.5 per cent on the week, in low volume. Heineken lost F1 1.70 to F1 149 before announcing its half-year results at the low end of market expectations. One analyst said that the shares did not justify their level of 12 or 13 times earnings. But she added that the price had already fallen Fl14.60 from its year's high and so was unlikely to fall much further. Interim figures on Thursday helped Internationale Neder- landen, the banking and insur- ance group, gain Fl1 to Fl 50.30 and Ahold, the retailer, add 70 cents to Fl 83.20. MILAN's Comit index fell 1.74 to 553.55, 0.3 per cent lower on a week debilitated by the postponement of the August account settlement. Transport had a poor day. Fiat closed another L33 lower at L5,605, following Thuseday's release of statistics, which indi- cated that the company had not benefited from a recovery in Italian car sales. Alitalla, a notoriously volatile airline stock, shed L40 to L750. ZURICH was disappointed that Swiss annual inflation fell to only 6.0 per cent in August from 6.6 per cent in July, and eased ahead of Monday's local holiday. The Credit Suisse index lost 1.7 to 533.2, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. OSLO fell for the sixth day in a row, the all-share index losing 1.00 to 509.87 for a 2.3 per cent decline on the week. Elsewhere in the Nordic region, STOCKHOLM and HEL- SINKI lost 3.2 and 3.5 per cent respectively on the week.",

   "text_content" : "Worries about Jardine Matheson's domicile have replaced a property share boom, writes Angus Foster M R JOHN Major may have impressed the world with his states- manship, but he cut little ice this week with the Hong Kong stock market. The blue-chip Hang Seng index closed down 19.25 at 3,970.91 yesterday, a loss of nearly 30 points on the week. This was in spite of the UK Prime Minister's visit to Bel- jing, where he signed the agreement on the colony's new airport. Although business is happy that the project is going ahead, the news had already been discounted and Hong Kong is mindful of other wor- ries. The market is now con- cerned about a threatened delisting of Jardine Matheson. The controlling Keswick family arrives in Hong Kong this weekend ahead of the group's interim reporting season. There are also fears that China, in defensive mood because of events in the Soviet Union, may speak out against Hong Kong's moves towards democracy. Next week Hong Kong holds its first ever direct elections for some seats on the ruling Council. The index has been consall- dating since mid-August, when it hit an all-time high of 4,079.01. It quickly recovered a sharp loss following the Soviet coup, but has since been lack. lustre. \"It's just drifting off. The market needs new impetus and that is just not there at the moment,\" according to Mr Richard Witts, managing direc- tor of United Mok Ying Kie. Turnover yesterday fell below HK$lbn (USS29m) for the first time in three weeks and amounted to HK$964.8m. Much of the reason for the drifting is that Hong Kong has already gained 31 per cent this year. In the first half of the year property companies, which account for 30 per cent of the-index and usually drive the market, led the gains as residential housing prices increased, sometimes by up to 40 per cent. Homebuyers returned to a market buoyed by effectively negative mortgage rates and renewed economic confidence following the end of the Gulf war. With inflation averaging more than 12 per cent this year, property is also being HMno Kong Innes Indim bredo Apiil2, 1966-100 seen as an investment hedge. Cheung Kong, Mr Li Ka- shing's property development group, has risen by 70 per cent this year. However, property prices are now expected to sta- bilise and there are even some fears of a correction. Hong Kong's affordability ratio, which measures the percentage of household income spent on mortgage repayments, has crept back above 70 per cent. But the figure is still some way off the ratios of more than 100 .per cent witnessed in the early 1980s, before Hong Kong's property crash. Mr Enzio von Pfeil at Smith New Court (Far East) says that the index is also misleading because it understates house- hold incomes. For this and other reasons, he does not expect a property crash. Meanwhile, investors are cautiously looking elsewhere. HSBC, the new London-based holding company for Hong- kong Bank, is undergoing a re- rating following the bank's higher-than-expected interim profits, up 21.6 per cent at HK$1.86bn. Several brokers have published extremely opti- mistic reports on the bank, pre- dicting that problems with its overseas subsidiaries are nearly over. Utilities, which have under- performed so far this year, may also come back into play. \"If we go into a prolonged consoli- dation phase, people will start looking at defensive stocks again,\" says a UK securities house in the colony. Jardine Matheson's plans to move its primary listing to London, and its threat to delist from Hong Kong, knocked its shares down by nearly 9 per cent at the end of August although the stock has now recovered. Jardine says that it is worried about China inter- fering in Hong Kong after 1997; but the company wants its shares to continue to be traded on the Hong Kong exchange, where the group accounts for about 10 per cent of market capitalisation. The Securities and Futures Commission, the overall fmiar- ket watchdog, and the stock exchange are now preparing public consultation documents and all sides hope a compro- mise can be reached. It is not clear what effect Jardine's move to London, or a delisting from Hong Kong, would have. While it may affect Hong Kong's image as a regional financial centre in the short term, it seems unlikely that investors 'in the group would stop buying and selling Hong Kong shares altogether. If the company does delist, say Hong Kong fund man- agers, they would have to reinvest their current exposure to Jardine in other Hong Kong stocks. Hong Kong pension funds would also be sensitive to currency exposure from holding Jardine's sterling denominated shares. With the market searching for direction, analysts are split over the immediate outlook, but most foresee the index end- ing the year at 4,000-4,200. Looking to next year, corporate profits growth - expected to be 13-15 per cent compared with an inflation rate of less than 10 per cent - will be the driving force, as long as politi- cal troubles with China remain in the background."

   "text_content" : "Tokyo A SHARP fall in short-term interest rates encouraged active trading yesterday. Vol- ume swelled to 650m shares on heavy trading in rate-sensitive shares, although prices ended below their highs as sugges- tions that the economy was not as weak as expected dented hopes of a discount rate cut, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose 192.95 to 22,692.60, a gain of 1.6 per cent on the week, after moving between a low of 22,489.47 and a high of 22,998.91 in the afternoon. Gains led losses by 747 by 249, while 138 issues were -unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 13.97 to 1,763.36 and, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.17 to 1,335.63. The injection of additional funds into the money markets by the central bank pushed the overnight unsecured call rate down to 6.9 per cent from 7.25 per cent, its first fall below 7 per cent since June last year. Government bond markets and futures rallied sharply, and share prices followed. Volume, which had reached 450m shares on Thursday, rose above the 600m level for the first time in 10 weeks. Traders said that buying had been led by foreigners and dealers, but there had also been demand from individuals and institu- tional investors, who had been reluctant recently to commit new funds to equities. The release of the Bank of Japan tankan, or quarterly sur- vey of business sentiment, prompted profit-taking in the bond and stock markets, as it revealed that conditions were not as weak as most econo- mists bad expected. The cen- tral bank reported that, although business sentiment was weaker, capital invest- ments had been revised upwards. Comments by the Bank of Japan that the economy was slowing gradually rather than sharply, discouraged market participants, who were expect- ing a cut in the official dis- count rate in the first half of this month. Analysts said that the central bank now intended to implement monetary policy through controlling the over- night call rate. Interest rate-sensitive, large- capital stocks were heavily traded. NKK, the most active issue of the day, rose Y5 to Y405 and Nippon Steel added Y8 to Y436. Ohbayashi Road Construc- tion, the roadbuilder, rose Y40 to Y2,280, hitting its year's high on buying by foreigners. Other issues in the sector were also firm on expectations that they will benefit from the gov- ernment's public works spend- ing plan. Continued interest in the cancer drug theme pushed Asahi Glass up Y20 to Y1,210. Reports that the company had developed a new drug to pre- vent the spread of cancer trig- gered the rally. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 219.72 to 24,865.73 - its seventh consecutive gain - in heavy volume of 88.7m shares, up from 86.8m. Nintendo, the game maker, added Y500 to Y12,800. Investors were encour- aged by the decline of its previ- ously high margin balance. Roundup THE REGION's markets made a muted end to the week, although Australia, like Japan, had plenty of business. AUSTRALIA saw a big lift in turnover, up from A$148m to A$522m, although the All Ordi- naries index put on only 0.3 to 1,572.0, up 2.1 per cent on the week. Large blocks of shares changed hands. Mayne Nick- less sold 58.3m shares, or 11.8 per cent, of Amcor at A$5.25 each. Amcor slipped 2 cents to A$5.44. Lend Lease, the property group, sold around 10 per cent of the supermarket developer and manager, Westfield Hold- ings, to brokers JB Were, which sold it on to a variety of investors at A$3.825. Westfield closed down 40 cents at A$3.95. Around 13m shares in Aus- tralian Consolidated Invest- ments, formerly Bell Resources, passed through the market. ACI closed down 1 cent at 25 cents. TAIWAN ended a mixed week with banks strong and the weighted index up 109.46 at 4,624.83, 2.4 per cent up on one day but only 1.3 per cent higher over five. There were rumours yesterday that the central bank had decided to cut its discount rate. BANG- KOK was lifted by finance shares, as the SET index ended - 5.45 higher at 728.51 on a turn- over of 3.66bn baht. KUALA LUMPUR fell 0.8 per cent on the day on index-linked selling, but rose by the same amount on the week. The com- posite index shed 4.58 to 557.92. SINGAPORE settled into a nar- row range. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 1.07 to 1,420.42, 0.8 per cent lower on a rumour-driven week. MANILA fell in last-minute selling, spurred by fears that the Philippine Senate will reject the controversial treaty that would allow the US mili- tary to continue operating its Philippine bases for 10 more years. The composite index declined 11.22 to 1,003.22, down 1.4 per cent on the week. SEOUL's composite index rose 0.13 to 674.94, down 1.6 per cent on the week. Recent for- eign buying in NEW ZEALAND petered out after a jump in the value of the New Zealand dol- lar. The NZSE-40 index closed 6.92 -lower at 1,425.23, still 0.7 per cent higher on the week.",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd and Mark Nicholon In in Moscow, Gillian T\"a in Vilnius and David Buchan in Brussels MR BORIS PANKIN, the Soviet foreign minister, yesterday heralded the end of more than half a century of annexation for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia with the announce- ment: \"We have recognised their independence. The Baltic republics are now separate from the Soviet Union.\" He was speaking after the independence decision was taken at the first meeting of the newly-formed State Coun- cil, the supreme body of union power. Mr Pankin stressed that prolonged negotiations would ensue between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union - cover- ing citizenship, social and legal rights, economic ties and the future of the estimated 400,000 Soviet military personnel sta- tioned there. Delegations, including on the Soviet side representatives from the contiguous Russian and Belorussian republics, would begin work mmedi- ately, he said. Nonetheless,tle Baltics, last to join the Soviet \"family\" under the coercive terms of the secret protocols of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact in 1940, and the republics withthe longest experience of independent statehood between the wars, now begin their second period as sovereign states. Moscow's long-awaited rec- ognition was welcomed in Vil- nius by Mr Vytautas Lansber- gis, Lithuania's president, as \"a positive and joyful action\" not just for the Baltics but also for the Soviet Union and entire world community. He hoped diplomatic links would be established soon \"once t ' ras clear what the Soviet .nion actually wants\". ccodi gto Mr Pankin, Mr r Sa r, the Estonian prime miniiiter who repre- sented all tlree states at the State Council, had said they were considering joining the proposed economic union of former Soviet republics. Baltic leaders have said that they will not join the Union, but seek bilateral economic treaties between themselves and the remaining Soviet states. Mr Arnold Ruutel, Estonia's president, said at a session of the World Economic Forum, an independent Swiss-based politi- cal and business grouping, in Moscow that an independent currency would not be intro- duced until Estonia had com- plete control of its territory - largely through the establish- ment of border and customs -osts. The'State Council; voted into existence by the extraordi. nary session of the now defunct Congress of Peoples Deputies on Thursday and composed of ir Gorbachev and 10 republican presidents, dis- cussed the outlook for eco- nomic union. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a member of the four-man Com- mittee for the Management of the Economy, which has been carrying out the functions of a Union government, told the Council that it would be con- eluded on the basis of full rec- ognition of the independence of member states. Special envoys will be appointed to finalise the treaty of economic union. Mr Pankin acknowledged that the issue of recompense for Soviet-owned enterprises on Baltic territories would be high on the agenda of negotia- tiong. At the same time, the Baltic states are sre to lodge counter claims for environmen- tal and other damage which they claim has been inflicted on them, as well as reparations for repressions after the war. * In Brussels, Baltic foreign ministers were warmly wel- comed by European Commu- nity foreign ministers and the European Commission. The EC ministers promised them aid and a start to trade talks, but shied away from any commit- ment to eventual full EC mem- bership. Mr Lennart Meri, Estonia's foreign minister, said \"the Second World War is over from this morning\". Ha work fqr Lithuania; other Soviet pews, Page 2",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington IT WAS a surreal experience. In the early hours of yesterday morning, barely a fortnight after the collapse of the coup in Moscow, President Mikhail Gorbachev and President Boris Yelstin sat side by side in the Kremlin fielding questions from American television viewers several thousand miles away. \"Do you believe in God?,\" asked a priest from the Ukrai- nian Church in Philadelphia. Mr Gorbachev, once rumoured by former president Ronald Reagan to be a secret believer, replied: \"I am an atheist\" - but quickly added how he believed, sincerely, in freedom of conscience. It was a virtuoso perfor- mance by Mr Gorbachev, who showed why he remains so popular in the US - and why he agreed to take part in ABC News's post-midnight \"tele- thon\". This feat of modern technology featured select audiences in 10 US cities, including San Francisco, Hous- ton, Atlanta and New York, throwing questions at the two Soviet leaders for more than an hour and was also shown on Soviet television. Not so long ago, Soviet lead- ers used to communicate to American people through \"peacenik\" letters to school- children in the Mid West; tele- vision has brought everyone closer. In the past two weeks, Americans have seen Soviet reformers, reactionaries, reli- gious leaders and all sorts on their screens. The televised news conference with Mr Gor- bachev and Mr Yeltsin was a fitting climax. Mr Gorbachev played to the women's movement, acknowl- edging deep discrimination in the Soviet Union; he admitted unequivocally that the com- munist model had failed in the Soviet Union - though he still talked wistfully about success- ful social democratic move- ments in Europe; he reassured Live wires: Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin taking US viewers' questions yesterday one young lady's concerns about Ralsa; and, in a direct message to President Bush, he pledged to co-operate with Mr Yeltsin to ensure stability in the Soviet Union. If Mr Gorbachev went down as smoothly as caviar, Mr Yelt- sin was more like borsch. OK, he said, women had a hard time in the Soviet Union - but on average they lived five years longer. Mr Yeltsin also told a grain trader in Chicago that if there were food short- ages, Russia would come first: \"You will deal with us.\" Yes, he liked the ritual aspects of church services, but was more \"superstitions\" than religious. The Russian presi- dent only came to life when he denounced communism. Substantively, the two lead- ers skated over most of their differences. Mr Gorbachev seemed less keen to break ties with Cuba, appearing eager to expand trade with the Castro regime. Mr Yeltsin appeared a little more Interested in open- ing up KGB flies. Mr Gorbachev showed that he can handle an American political format, where show business counts for a lot. It may not help him if he decides to run for president in elec- tions in the Soviet Union next year; but if the Democratic party were looking for a candi- date with a deep knowledge of foreign affairs, a statesman to match Mr Bush, then Mr Gorb- achev may well be their man."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-07",
   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuler UNICHEM'S Â£75m takeover bid for Macarthy, which owns 175 UK chemists' shops, was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday because of concerns about competition in the wholesaling of prescription drugs. UniChem, a UK pharmaceu- ticals wholesaler, has nearly 28 per cent of the market in sup plying Britain's 11,800 chem- ists' shops. A similar chunk is served by Vestric, part of the healthcare group AAH. Boots, Britain's largest retail chemist, has its own distribution system for its 1,070 shops. The referral by the Office of Fair Trading is a blow for Uni- Chem, which was fighting for Macarthy against two rivals. Lloyds Chemists is the highest bidder at Â£83m, while Gramp Ian Holdings is the suitor least favoured by Macarthy but the only one which has been cleared so far by the OFT. Macarthy was not pleased by the referral. Just before the OFT announcement, it had said it was continuing to talk to UniChem and Lloyds to see if either would offer terms it could recommend. With Uni- Chem's offer lapsed until after the MMC decision in Decem- ber, the scope for playing one off against the other is greatly reduced. Yesterday's referral was Uni- Chem's second brush with UK competition regulators. In 1989, when UniChem was still a co- operative, the MMC ruled that a share incentive scheme it was offering to its pharmacist customers was anti-competi- tive. UniChem floated on the stock market last year and is about 70 per cent owned by more than 4,000 pharmacists. One of the loudest protesters against UniChem's share scheme was Macarthy, which had previously tried unsuccess- fully to take it over. But now Macarthy is lament- ing the referral, albeit under a different senior management - which has been offered jobs by UniChem but not by Lloyds. Mr Ian Parsons, Macarthy's chief executive, said: \"We fought for an even playing field for our shareholders. We did not want impediments in the way of the best possible offer being put on the table.\" Mr Jeff Harris, UniChem's finance director, echoed the disappointment. \"We are talking about a tiny switch of market share, little more than 1 percentage point,\" assuming that UniChem replaced Medico- pharma, a Dutch company, as wholesaler to Savory & Moore. The OFT seemed uneasy about the development of a duopoly if there were a setback to Medicopharma, which has been number three in the mar- ket since buying Macarthy's wholesaling business. A related concern is that heavy regulation of prescription drug supply may have unwittingly fostered conditions for reduced competition.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston BRITISH AEROSPACE, the UK aerospace and car manufac- turer, is planning to raise up to Â£500m by selling new shares in a rights issue. The share sale is planned for next Wednesday, when BAe announces its first-half results, unless there is a significant change in stock market condi- tions. The amount likely to be raised is substantial compared with its market capitalisation of Â£l.47bn. BAe's need for a rights issue is not immediately apparent from its balance sheet at the end of 1990, which showed that it had net cash of Â£700m. How- ever, all this cash was advance payments from Saudi Arabia on defence orders, according to Mr Chris Avery, an analyst at brokers Smith New Court. He estimates that the com- pany's underlying debt was around Â£800m, excluding these advance payments, and that borrowings have increased sharply this year. But the main reason for the issue is not to reduce the bur- den of interest payments but to increase the company's equity base, which will give it greater security for carrying out hedg- ing transactions in the foreign exchange market. Analysts estimate BAe has forward orders totalling Â£15bn. It will receive payments on most of these in dollars, but as a UK manufacturer its over- heads are denominated in ster- ling. BAe therefore needs to carry out big hedging deals in order to reduce its vulnerabil- ity to currency movements. BAe's interim results will show that it has been badly hit by the recession. The Rover motor vehicle subsidiary has fallen into losses and defence profits are down. The group's interim pre-tax profits are expected to emerge at about Â£85m, at the bottom end of analysts' expectations, compared with Â£146m in the same period last year."

   "text_content" : "THE market- viay, not have seen the mooted flood of rights issues this week, but it had an interest rate cut to feast on as well as speculation on a November election. It would be tempting to assume that this has created fresh upside poten- tial, even from present rarefied levels. But the rights issue threat has not disappeared, and the new politicald uncer- tainty has tually increased he downsid risk for shares. Whether an election is in the offing or not, the market is suddenly more vulnerable to - swings in opinion polls. Prices tend to, overshoot in response to political impulses, ;ks the Soviet coup showed. A *Conservative victory in a TZNovember election would not 'alter the weak recovery pros- pWict which is fully discounted. ,at current prices. Indeed, with inflation set to hit a low in October, a newly-elected gov- .ernment could shrug off pres- sure to boost the recovery by ;eutting interest rates further. It might even be forced to raise them if German policy were tightened ahead of the 1992 wage round. A decision to call a Novem- ber election would probably force the government to post- pone the BT share offer. Assuming a Conservative win, that would provide only tempo- rary relief for institutional liquidity. There would be wor- ries of a different kind if Labour won. Foreign exchange markets would almost cer- tainly insist on quickly testing Mr Kinnock's determination to defend sterling's parity in the exchange rate mechanism. BT sale A feature of UK privatisa- tions has been the way the reg- ulatory goalposts have moved, to an extent not even hinted at in the offer prospectuses. Clearly, regulators such as Ofwat take time to find their feet in a new industry frame- work. By contrast, Oftel has enjoyed a 10 year run up to the forthcoming BT secondary sale. Nevertheless, investors who read the offer document should be aware that the sec- tion on regulation is drafted by the parties selling the shares, rather than by the regulator. Whether Sir Bryan Carsberg will speak clearly about his intentions before the sale gath- ers further momentum is another matter, but arguably he should. The recent duopoly review notwithstanding, it is hard to see how BT can avoid further regulation at next year's price fixing - its cur- rent return on capital of 23 per FT-SE IndiW: 2AMA (+4.1) nvestment trust I discount to asset valu % dicoount -14 -26 iversicaton have scarcely avoidable implications for tele- corns, BT jill generate a huge amount of cash in the next few years, most of the money com- ing from its domestic custom- ers. Politically, it will be unable, to give it o sharehold ers as pgher dividends. Doubt- less it Intends to invest abroad in related telecoms businesses. If its poor overseas record to date is a guide, domestic cus- tomers might find themselves merely subsidising more expensive failures. Oftel will have to examine the possibility of separating the financing of overseas ventures; but that would not solve the problem of surplus cash in the domestic business. It all points to the logic of an eventual break-up. That possibility is unlikely to be mentioned in the offer for sale. Investment trusts The news that M & G and Fidelity are poised to launch investment trusts in the next month removes another of life's little certainties. Both und management groups, after all, are synonymous with the rival unit trust industry: M & G is probably its most con- sistent long term performer, Fidelity perhaps its brashest and most successful upstart. The US-owned giant's entry into the UK retail investment business in the early 1980s could scarcely have been better timed. Whereas unit trusts have struggled to recapture their appeal following the 1987 crash, investment trusts have been enjoying something of a long term come-back. Derided as fuddy-duddy and inefficient just a decade ago, the sector's more enterprising promoters have carved out a niche provid- ing specialist funds for the institutions, as well a high- lighting fiscal changes which have benefited the private investor. The volume of paper has shrunk thanks to Globe and other big takeovers - boosting performance as the discount narrows - yet it is striking that almost 100 new investment trusts have raised Â£2.5bn of new money since 1965. M& G insists that it has not suffered a conversion; its forth- coming fund is only structured as an investment trust to take advantage of the UK's restric- tive personal equity plan (PEP) rules. Fidelity, though, is threatening to launch a batch of investment trusts in the next three years, using innova- tive marketing to support demand. Time will tell whether the move is as inspired as the one a decade ago, or whether it is a sign that Fidelity's unit trust side is running out of steam. Building societies Never mind the banks, look at building societies. This week's 0.45 and 0.4 percentage point cuts in lending rates at Halifax and Abbey National - a response to Wednesday's half point cut in UK base rates - is a reminder that mortgage spe- cialists play the margin widen- ing game as well Interest rate cuts since last October total- ling 3.5 percentage points up to this week, for example, have in particular been cleverly exploited by Abbey (a bank, but only in name). Over the same period the group's mort- gage rate for bigger borrowers fell by 3.1 per points, the rates paid on its Instant Saver and Five Star accounts by 3.8 and 4.25 points respectively. With other devices like the timing of the changes worth millions of pounds in profits, shareholders (though not customers) will be hoping for more this time round. To be fair, margins were badly squeezed last year, bad debts are rising and the societies need wider spreads to compensate for lower returns on their free capital. Macarthy The Macarthy board's advice to do nothing after the rude unseating of UniChem's bid is doubtless unaffected by the fact that a successful Lloyds Chemists is unlikely to require its services. Shareholders who prefer to avoid Lloyds' paper might justifiably sell in the market",

With economic trends, industry developments and currency movements affecting thousands of securities in the world's stockmarkets, the private individual lacks the time and resources to identify the opportunities - and to avoid the pitfalls. Mercury, on the other hand, is well-equipped to do just this. We research individual companies and stockmarkets around the world through our network of international offices. Mercury's 120-strong fund management team interprets this information against an evolving global strategy which takes full account of economic, political and exchange rate factors. This breadth of resource has contributed in large measure to our consistent long-term performance achievement - and to our being chosen to manage investments totalling over Â£35 billion for more than 500 companies, charities and public bodies. It is also available to private individuals.

   "text_content" : "Philip Stephens assesses the prime minister's inner circle, in which sporting chums, would-be rivals and 'classless' advisers decide government policy over breakfast \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t HERE IS no eminence grise l1' the mould of Charles Powell, no brooding presence like Bernard Ingham. Nor is there a kitchen cabinet of the kiud. which sprved Harold Wilson in the days When honours lists could be scrawled on lavender notepaper. Buit after nine months in Downing' Street John Major, the British prime min- ister, has assembled the cast of colleagues and confidantes who will help shape his premiership. If he wins the general elec- tion they will emerge from the shadows as among the most influential figures in Brit- ish politics. It is an odd bunch. Cabinet colleagues mingle with fellow football and cricket fans and with civil servants and advisers befriended in the Treasury, contempo- raries from his time in the government Whips' Office; with neighbours in East Angian politics. Some share his humble background. Others his unease that the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher was too ready to sacrifice the underprivileged on the altar of market economics. Some are erstwhile rivals for the party leadership. Like their boss many are relative inno- cents at this level of politics. After the slick, unremitting professionalism of the Thatcher entourage, there have been occa- sions when Major's men and women have looked like well-intentioned amateurs. They - and the prime minister - learnt the hard way just why Thatcher's speech- writers would spend days, even weeks drafting, redrafting and honing the speeches she delivered to the Tory party faithful. She was never heard in polite silence. As his advisers have gained experience, early pledges to create a \"classless\" soci- ety and to invent a new creed of \"Major- ism\" are looked back on with more than a hint of embarrassment. Most of those in the new team are 10 or 15 years younger than their predecessors. Some confess that they still shake their heads occasionally to remind themselves it is real. There is Gus O'Donnell, another south London grammar-school boy turned Trea- sury economist chosen to fill Ingham's size 10 boots in the Downing Street press office. Sarah Hogg, the erstwhile econom- ics writer who second-guessed (and impressed) Major when he was chancellor, heads the all-important policy unit. Chris Patten, the intellectual beacon of the Tory left, is charged with election strategy as party chairman. Richard Ryder, a slight, boyish figure who entered parliament only in 1983, commands the party at Westmin- ster as chief whip. Then there is David Mellor, a long-time companion of Major at Chelsea football ground, now charged with control of public spending. From the ancien regime comes John Wakeham, the supreme political fixer who may yet emerge as the Willie Whitelaw of Major's government. Douglas Hurd, the Old Etonian gentleman of the cabinet, is not counted a close personal friend. But as foreign secretary he has become the wise uncle, trusted by a prime minister whose own three months in that role left him a relative novice in foreign affairs. There are more than half-a-dozen others, some civil servants, Tory ministers or backbench MPs, some political advisers. All share one thing: influence. They attend the regular No 10 Downing Street breakfasts at which Major floats ideas for a fourth Conservative term over platters of fried eggs, bacon and sausages. They are recipients of the Sunday morning telephone calls which he uses to consult and confide in private. Some are guests at the informal lunches at Chequers which the prime minister builds around his per- sonal heroes from the more innocent world of county cricket. Major has promised a more consensual style of government to match the caring Conservatism he is offering voters. He has, we are told, no time for the cronyism which tarnished the reputations of so many of his predecessors. \"He is a meritocrat. He does not want sycophants,\" comments one in the most charmed inner circle. \"He wants argu- ments not compliments\". Old hands mar- vel at the frankness of Cabinet discus- sions. \"We talk about things, argue\", a senior minister blurts out with the wide-eyed innocence of a schoolboy. The good intentions are genuine, a coin- cidence of Major's personality and astute political instincts. He built his political success - from humble backbench MP to prime minister in a dozen years - on an ability to make friends, scores of them. He is as happy serving as eating the fried bread at those No 10 breakfasts. The breakfasts and the phone calls - informal, chatty friendly - are the tools of a politician who has prospered by drawing the best from his advisers and friends. \"He wants to know what you think, really think. . how you say it when there are no civil servants around\", one recipient of an early morning call comments. He is also a pragmatist, a man who does not believe in Phi- losopher Kings. So, unlike Thatcher there is no ideologi- cal mentor lurking in the shadows. For her the Downing Street pol- icy unit - headed by loyalists such as John Hoskins and Brian Griffiths - was the praetorian guard which battled the forces of conservatism in her own party. Under Major it is concerned with practical policy rather than political ideology. Friends say he is acutely conscious also of the risks of retreating into the splendid isolation of his predecessor. For all the talk of conspiracies, Thatcher ultimately fell because her courtiers were too obse- quious, too blind to her political mortality, to warn her of the gathering storm. But no prime minister can operate effec- tively in the British system of government without a group of trusted fMends who will to do his or her bidding in the jungles of Whitehall and Westminster. The occupant of 10 Downing Street has immense powers of patronage in the min- isterial and civil service machines. Yet he is the only senior minister without his own department. The two dozen or so senior officials in the cabinet office, his private office and the No 10 policy unit compare with hundreds who work directly for the chancellor, the foreign secretary or the health secretary. As Major found to his cost in the uncer- tain early months, the departmental empires are jealous guardians of their ter- ritory, powerful forces for inertia. The prime minister needs personal agents to translate his policies into the day-to-day business of government. Major's men and women occupy a series of circles drawn during 12 years at West- minster. There is the whips' circle, the Treasury circle, the East Anglian circle, the sports circle. The most influential claim membership of more than one. Most, though not all, are in their 40s, children of post rather than pre-war Tory politics. Ryder is the best example. Like Major he served a junior government whip. He worked for him in the Treasury and his constituency, like the prime minister's, is in East Anglia. The 42-year-old son of a Suffolk farmer, Ryder's career in politics began when he became Thatcher's politi- cal secretary in 1975. By last November he was a middle-ranking Treasury minister but it was his role in running the press side of Major's leadership campaign that catapulted him into a job he had coveted. A quiet, outwardly diffident man, Ryder's job is to keep the Tory party at Westminster - still fragile and fractured after the civil war last autumn - solidly behind Major. He meets the prime minis- ter daily, sits in on the important cabinet committees, acts as referee in disputes between senior colleagues, and, crucially, advises on what is politically possible: on the poll tax, Europe, the economy. He made little public impression when he worked for Major in the Treasury but now a colleague describes him as the \"vital pivot between Westminster and Whitehall\". Another wonders how so apparently gentle a man can be so \"utterly ruthless in managing colleagues\". Major trusts him completely. Patten is from a different mould. The anti-Thatcherite who finally made it to her Cabinet, he was once regarded as Major's closest rival for the party leadership. Last autumn he backed Hurd. But in a shrewd move which rewarded his talents and tied Patten's fortunes to his own, Major made him party chairman. In other circumstances they might not be close friends. Their political instincts are similar but forged from different back- grounds. At 47 Patten is a year younger than his boss but he is consciously edu- cated, a philosopher politician who draws his metaphors from the classics. Major prefers to describe his Conservatism as simply a \"common sense view of life from a tolerant perspective\". In the approach to a general election, however, party chairman and prime minis- ter can never be far from each other. And those who watch them working together believe that both have convinced them- selves that the political alliance has devel- oped into personal friendship. The relative youth of Ryder and Patten is supplemented by the battle-hardened guile of Wakeham on the team set up in May to map out the government's commu- nications strategy. At 59 he is stepping down from the Commons at the general election, but his colleagues expect a re- elected Major to give him a prominent role in the House of Lords. John MacGregor, leader of the com- mons, whose fortunes and reputation have revived since Thatcher's departure, is the fourth of these musketeers. Another ex- Treasury minister, MacGregor has played an important role in refereeing disputes about public spending and is tipped as a likely chairman if the Star Chamber is convened to break any deadlock at the end of the spending negotiations. They meet most mornings at 8.30 (three sip orange juice and coffee, Wakeham chain-smokes the cigars so apposite to his image) to ensure that while running the government ministers do not forget about winning the election. Inside Downing Street, Hogg has emerged as the most influential adviser. Early on she cut through the mutual sus- picions which clouded the prime minis- ter's relationship with Michael Heseltine as they mapped out the replacement for the poll tax. More recently she was charged with knocking ministerial heads together to add substance to the promise of the Citizen's Charter. As one cabinet minister puts it: \"She is a superb operator. Three weeks before it was published there was nothing in it. She made it work\". The brisk no-nonsense Hogg, married to Douglas Hogg, the foreign office minister, heads a team of seven in the policy unit. She is dry on economics but is a liberal on social policy. Like the prime minister she prefers pragmatism to philosophy. Major is comfortable working with * Turn to Page XX",

   "text_content" : "INCE THE beginning of 1991 - a period that coincides roughly with the stock market rally - UK short-term interest rates have dropped by 27 per cent and the FT-SE index has risen by 24 per cent. The close corre- lation between the downward shift in interest rates and the upward move in equities is clear from the chart: the two lines are mirror images. Over short periods, the two lines sometimes move differ- ently: in the late spring, for example, interest rates contin- ued to fall, but the equity mar- ket moved sideways. None the less, the divergence over the last week or so has been partic- ularly noticeable. Market interest rates have dropped significantly - a decline reflected in this week's half percentage point base rate cut - but the equity market has made little progress. The mood has been cautious about how far share prices can be expected to advance. The stockbroker's comment that pushed these concerns to their limit this week came from Nicholas Knight, of Nomura Research Institute, who was among the earliest and most enthusiastic propo- nents of a bull market late last year. He announced a melodra- matic reversal of view: Nomura's year-end target for the FT-SE was reduced from 2,600 to 2,400 - implying a 10 per cent decline from current levels. For 1992 the reduction was, if anything, more drastic still: to 2,700 from a previous forecast of 3,200. FT-SE closed on Friday at 2,667.4, a rise of 21.7 on the week. So Knight is expecting a 1.2 per cent rise in the FT-SE over the next 16 months, a drop of over 2 per cent in real terms. If your first aim is pres- ervation of capital, as the sage of stock market analysis Belna- min Graham urges, the mean- ing of such a forecast is clear. stay out of UK equities. Or, as Knight puts it: \"At best cash looks competitive; at worst it looks a godsend\". His argument is simple: that just as the market forgot last year that equities typically start to recover well before the bottom of a recessionary trough, it is in danger of forget- ting this year that the arrival of already-discounted good news is typically marked by sharp sell-offs. Price/earnings ratios start shrinking at an early stage of the economic recovery, partly or wholly off- setting the rising earnings that recovery brings. This year, because the mar- ket has risen so rapidly, that process may take effect much earlier in the economic cycle, before the recovery is fully under way. In short, \"it will not be very long before the story switches from stock prices rising on bad news to falling on good.\" IntIhiank rate PAI 15 10 samo SuoM:mtb brn (Â·- 2,700 2,600 2,500 2.400; 2,300 2,200 2,100 2,000 i_ ~ Â· Index Thus, says Knight, even if all goes well and there are no nasty surprises in the year ahead, you shoul 4expect p/e 'ratios to'drop frboo their cur- renit 14,5 aversae t around 10. If things go wrong the, sur- prises could' ,e vry t.asty indeed - perhpsa1987style crash. Most other comimentators disagree, with varying degrees of vehemence (one called Knight \"a perfect contra-cycli- cal indicator\"). Roger Palmer at Kleinwort Benson this week set a target of 3,000 oni the FT-SE within six months; Andrew Semple at County Nat- West called for 2,700 by the end of the year and 3,100 by the end of 1992, arguing that the shift to sustained lower infla- tion fully justified p/e ratios in the mid-teens. Bill Smith at BZW, expecting 2,950 by the end of next year, also empha- sised his team's expectation of 3 per cent economic growth next year, nearly twice as strong as the consensus. In the short term, though, there seems to be a general expectation that the market is likely to pause, held back by rights issues - a wave of which is still confidently expected despite this week's drought - and by the need to await confirmation of eco- nomic recovery before any fur- ther upwards move. This week at least, that con- firmation was hard to glean in the welter of interim results. Only Cookson's chairman, Rob- ert Malpas, said unambigu- ously that there were \"tenta- tive signs of recovery\". Other chairmen confined themselves to the thought that the econ- omy was now bouncing along the bottom, and was unlikely to fall further. There was little to remark in the results themselves - one analyst, rising to the occasion, said there were \"fewer sur- prises than expected\", a.perfect example of stock market jar- gon. The lack of surprises prob- ably contributed to the unfa- vourable attention given to BTR's results, in which a change of accounting policy turned what would have been an 11 per cent decline in profits into a 1 per cent increase. BTR's share price, which had initially risen 9p on the results, dropped back as the impact of the accounting change sank in. They ended the day of the announcement, Thursday, down 5p on the day at 424p, which turned out to be Fri- day's closing price as well. Though Wednesday's base- rate cut had little direct impact on the financial markets, it caused a great leap in the mar- ket or political excitement. The belief that the Conserva- tite government might be pre- paring the way for an election, and that it would only do so if it was sure of winning, led to a strong performance by water and regional electricity stocks, which stand to gain from any removal of political uncer- tainty. For the market as a whole, the political impact was less easy to judge. Clear signs that the government is really plan. ning a November poll might well - after a brief burst of enthusiasm - leave equities vulnerable to upsets, as foreign investors in particular reacted jumpily to every piece of opin- ion polling. On balance, how- ever, the City probably expects an election in early 1992, rather than in late 1991. For the moment, therefore, the market remains in limbo, waiting for the confirmation of economic recovery that most people expect would lead to a further advance - or for bearish reverses.

One popular measure is the \"misery index\", which simply adds the figure for annual inflation to unemployment (expressed as a percentage of the workforce). Nobody pretends that a measure this crude will predict the exact results of the next election, but the graph does make interesting reading. If the theory is right, people are getting much less miserable, so this is a good time for the government to go to the polls. Times when the misery index were high correspond closely to to high Labour poll ratings. Housing market falls to revive This year's Interest cuts are yet to have much effect on the housing market, according to the Nationwide Building Society's house price index for August The figures show an average one per cent drop in house prices since July. The average UK house costs Â£56,337, down from Â£60.675 in August 1980, according to Nationwide. John Hutchinson. of Nationwide, said: \"While the recession continues and uncertainty over employment prospects deters people from moving house, it appears unlikely that the market will pick up to any significant degree.\" Nationwide's findings were backed up by a separate survey conducted by Infolink, the credit information agency. Mortgage applications for July were 3.9 per cent down on the same month last year leading Infolink to conclude that there is no indication of a recovery in the housing market.

   "text_content" : "ISCO FEVER. That, in the memorable phrase of one Wall Street wit, is what the US markets got a bout of this week. Traders became obsessed with the question of whether the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy yet again, or whether the tentative Ameri- can economic recovery is enough to keep interest rates where they are. The question still hangs unresolved in the air this weekend, after a succession of economic statistics which have underlined that, while some sort of recovery is under way, it remains very modest. Throughout the week the market's attention was firmly focused on statistics for employment during August, due out yesterday morning, in the belief that a poor set of figures would encourage the Fed to drop the discount rate from 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent (hence disco fever), and esMe the important Fed funds rate from 5.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. In the event, however, the figures were an anti-climax: not that poor, but not that good either. They were broadly in line with what the analysts had been expecting, showing a 34,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, compared to a drop of 73,000 in July, and an Increase of 42,000 in manu- facturing jobs. The manufacturing figures, following a strong improve- ment in the monthly index of purchasing managers - an Important guage of sentiment - shows that industrial pro- duction is expanding signifi- cantly. But a substantial proportion of this may be due to a cyclical rebuild of inventory, and it remains far from certain that consumer coanflldence Is recov- ering sucelently to sustain the manufacturinga pturn in the months ahead.

The company announced that it would pay no compen- sation, severance or future legal expenses to the four most senior executives who have resigned. Giving testimony before a Congressional Committee, Bus- sett revealed that Salomon had controlled 94 per cent of a Treasury note auction in May - an extraordinarily high fig- ure. It was, he added, almost like a \"self destruct mecha- nism.\" Congressmen are pressing ahead with legislative propos- als to tighten up regulation of the Government bond market- in spite of pleas for caution from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury.

The company has just begun a road-show to woo US fund managers, who have been expressing concern about the company's future manage- ment, given that Lee lacocca, the chairman, is nearly 67. Perhaps that is why Chrysler chose this week to answer the second most popular uessing game in Detroit: when will lacocca retire?

   "text_content" : "By Scheherazade Daneshkhu T AX BREAKS. Who needs them? The government seems to have forgotten the answer, to this question. During the past 10 years, a series of schemes has been introduced by the govern- ment aimed at broadening the base of public participation into savings Janinvestment. These included, in descend- ing order of ideological popu- lism, Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (Tespas), Personal Equity Plans (Peps) and the Business Expansion Scheme (BES). The first two were for small savers while the last was intended to entice shareholders into riskier investments to prop up manufacturing. All 'made use of generous tax 'breaks as the lure. But the aim of each has been skewered along the way. The original idea of encouraging broader participation and attracting new money has been diverted along a path sign- posted increasingly by sinan- cial institutions rather than government. John Major's 1990 Budget for Savers took its name princi- pally from the introduction of Tessas which were aimed at the \"mass of ordinary taxpay- ing savers\" in the then Chan- cellor's words. Under the scheme individuals may save a total of Â£9,000 over five years earning tax-free interest if the capital is not withdrawn. The concept was easy to understand and the product could be taken out at any building society or bank. The government wanted to improve the savings ratio - personal savings divided by disposable income - which was down at 6.6 per cent in 1989 from 11.4 per cent in 1984. It hoped to do so by encourag- ing the man and woman on the street to put aside a regular amount of savings every month which would encourage a savings mentality leading to riskier investments, in the form of equities later. The new scheme was com- pared favourably to existing Save As You Earn (SAYE) Save AsYou Ear (SAYE National Savings schemes .administered by building soci- eties. SAYE schemes were introduced in 1969, originally allowing savers to put away Â£10 a month. However, Tessas have attracted surprisingly little \"new\" money. In the first six months, 80 per cent of the 370,000 Tessas sold by Halifax Building Society were opened with money which came straight out of other Halifax accounts. At Skipton Building Society, 88 per cent of Tessa money was transferred from other accounts. Moreover, the accounts did not seem to be used for regular saving. Six months after Tes- sas were launched, the average balance in a Halifax Tessa stood at Â£2,700, almost up to the maximum of Â£3,000 for the first year. learly, those who already had savings quickly took out a Tessa to obtain the tax concession. Regular savers were all but ignored by the societies who packaged their Tessas so that the best returns and bonuses would be had by those investing the maximum amounts for each year. The few fixed-rate schemes tended to need large lump sums for those wanting to start. For example, Bristol and West offered a \"guaranteed\" Tessa paying 11.25 per cent over five years but you needed to deposit the maximum Â£3,000 to start and put in money into an annuity to fund further pay- ments into the Tessa. It is a similar story with Peps. These were a Nigel Law- son inspiration and their exemption from income tax and capital gains tax was again to encourage as many people as possible to become share- holders, in order to create \"popular capitalism\". When they were launched in 1987, Peps were aimed at the smaller investor (no more than Â£200 a month), and were designed to ensure that there was a direct link between shareholders and companies. But the companies promo- ting Peps found small accounts too uneconomical to handle and have shown little time for the small investor, pressing instead for more upmarket Peps which have been taken up by the sophisticated inves- tor who already had a portfolio of shares. The government has obliged. Up to Â£6,000 a year can now be invested but the maxi- mum into a unit trust or investment trust is still only Â£3,000. Peps have turned into a tax shelter rather than an encour- agement to new investors while unit trusts and invest- ment trusts have relished the increased business. Much the same has hap- pened with the BES, (see oppo- site) a much older scheme introduced at the beginning of the Thatcher decade. It was different from Tessas and Peps in that it was only likely to appeal to those with money to lose but the aim was still to promote wider share ownership among the public. Most of the total public BES investment in 1983 was into the hands of fund managers who spread the investment across a number of manufac- turing companies as a way of reducing risk for the investor. But promoters and the larger investors were drawn towards asset-backed companies rather than manufacturing. Once again, the government has obliged and BES now provides investment in low-grade rental accommodation, provided by sponsors, rather than manufac- turing. The relative safety of such investment compared to manufacturing can be seen in the drop in BES fund invest- ment from Â£47m in 1983 to less than Elm last year. But if risk has been minimised to such an extent, it is difficult to see why the government should provide tax breaks. It is difficult to resist con- cluding that despite the gov- ernment's original intentions, the ordinary saver has scarcely benefited from tax breaks. Instead, it is the wealthy inves- tor, investment institutions and intermediaries who have prospered for very little effort.",

However, advisers have shown more willingnes&sto con- sider the BES over the last year, thanks to the latest idea by the corporate financiers who sponsor the scheme. This is the \"buy-back\" com- pany. A BES company spends Â£5m on housing, which is then used by another body, such as a university or housing associ- ation. The university cove- nants to buy back the housing stock after five years at a fixed price, typically equivalent to around Â£1.35 for every- l origi- nally spent. This reduces risk, and these schemes dominated the market last year. As a rule, it is only covenanted buy-back schemes which mainstream advisers will touch. The notional interest rates on offer are very impressive - once 40 per cent tax relief has been taken into account, the typical annual return is around 17 per cent, although you should remember that you can- not get any income out within five years, unless you buy another product such as a tem- porary annuity. However, the early failures of the BES are proving hard to live down, which explains attempts to popularise new names for the schemes - for example, Johnson Fry tries to call them FIGS (Fixed Interest Growth Shares), while Close Brothers now offers a BESSA (Business Expansion Secure Share Account). Are these schemes all that they seem? There are certainly more snags than the brochures and marketing tactics, which the bogus randeur to ma blackm, would let you belive. One -roblem is that the schemes are only as strong a their guaantor. Universities and houslig associations are not prfit-makng bodies, and are not mmune to failure. However, an innovation of the current BES season is to arrange third-party underwrit- ing with a bank. IMAGE, which invests in property in the south west, has its buy- back underwritten by the Bank of America, a double A credit- rated institution. Other schemes are planning to follow this lead. They may also fail to deliver by simply not doing the deals they say they will If a scheme does not have covenants in place when it launches, it could be a long time before your money is invested. That also harms the tax relief you eventually receive. Again, sponsors are trying to improve this for the current season. Sun Life has made a point of starting its company's activi- ties early, so tax relief should come through sooner. Given the BES's past record, it seems unwise to invest in schemes which do not have a formal buy-back covenant unless you are very rich, a born gambler and deeply averse to paying tax. If so there are a number of \"preda- tor\"-type BES companies. They raise money in the usual way and then go looking for bar- gains, of which there are plenty in the recession. They buy property cheap, let it for five years, and then sell it, hoping to catch a recovery in the housing market. The lack of an assured exit route, along with no definite deals already in place at the outset, make these schemes inherently much more risky. However, the kind of bargains which the various operators have been picking up suggest that you could be on to a win- ner with your risk money. The BES has managed to synthesise a number of differ- ent products with different lev- els of risk. There are some opportunities, but investors still need to be very wary of the misleading claims which Utter the industry. John Authers li^i fft ; YOU BUY newly-issued shares in the BES company and obtain tax relief on what you invest at your top rate of tax. The maximum amount on which relief can be claimed is Â£40,000 in any tax year. How- ever, you can carry forward relief if you invest before Octo- ber 5 - hence the rash of schemes write John Authers and Scheherazade Daneshkhu. To qualify for relief, the shares must be held for five years. There is no capital gains tax when shares are realised. The full sum of the investment must be .initially paid to the scheme, who will then send a BES 3 form. The company can- not issue these until at least four months after it has started trading. It also needs to satisfy tax inspectors that it trades fully in accordance with BES rules. Once you have the form THE BASICS you can claim your relief. * Choosing a Scheme: The new schemes make assessment difficult. BESt Investment magazine (TeL 071 936 2037) warns inves- tors that the assumptions used by different promoters quoting returns vary. Some are struc- tured in a way that exposes investors to risk from high repair costs, low rental demand and tax liabilities on the sale of the properties. BESt has calculated adjusted returns (below) based on a six month delay for tax relief and realisation after five years. Allenbridge, which publishes Best BES Advice magazine (071-409-1111), also includes in its calculations: * How strong is the guaran- teeing covenant? This deter- mines the ability of the institu- tion offering the buyback option to meet its obligation. * An assessment of the secu- rity provided by the property assets the company will be purchasing. This helps guard against any political risk. * Current Issues. Investors are spoilt for choice. \"Buy-back\" schemes launched in the last week include: Great Western Assured Growth, sponsored by Darting- ton & Co, will buy housing for Knightstone housing associa- tion, based in the south west. Adjusted return: 162 per cent. Johnson Fry Super Growth has covenants from Bedfordshire Pilgrim Housing Association and Swansea university . Adjusted return: 15.7 per cent. San Life BesRes VII Campus will also invest in university and housing association accommodation. Adjusted return: 15.9 per cent. BESSA UKC, sponsored by Close Brothers, will buy stu- dent accommodation for the University of Kent. Adjusted return: 15.7 per cent. Hungrier schemes include: Johnson Fry Predator will hunt for bargains mainly in the south of England. Kerrington Developments m, also under the Johnson Fry wing, will chase bargains in north west London. Oxford Academic Housing, from the same sponsor, will buy properties in Oxford and let it out for student digs. South East Recovery U, spon- sored by solicitor Neill Clerk will scavenge in the south east. SunLife BesRes VII Phoenix buys from troubled developers.",

   "text_content" : "WlAL ad erw s Fproably a polit way to dearib the .of the govormunt's imrdiln olfh Duuinsim m hion I uSch ie A S today is very dissent its pdecessor, the Businessm StartUp Scheme, introduced in 191. During the last recession, the govrnment tried to emeurage people to move their money from deposit accounts to new companIes to encourage manufacturing. -GeoryH Bowe, then Chancellor, described the Business Start-Up scheme In his 1981 Budgt as a way of \"ovreomin the difficulties oxperinced by people starting their own business In attracting risk capitaL\" The incentive for private investors was generous tax relief avallable at the Investor's highest rate of tax - then 75 per cent - on the money Invested. The disadvantage was risk. uat the public response was disappolnting and BSS raised less than Â£40m in its first two years. This was primarily because of the complexity of the legislation which included much anti-avoidance provisions, according to Mavis Seymour, BES specialist at Stoy Hayward. A more concerted attempt to develop the scheme - which, for the government had the virtue of promoting wider share ownership - was made in 1983. The ceiling on investment qualifying for tax relief was raised from Â£10,000 to Â£40,000, and Investments were allowed in companies wishing to expand, not restricted to investment in new companies as under BSS. Hence the change of name to the Business Expansion scheme. This made it easier for companies to obtain equity. The higher celling meant that a company which needed Â£300,000 In Investment now only had to find eight investors rather than 30. For the investor, the tax relief was greater, making the potential risk more worth taking. BES finally took off - the total funds raised through public offers in its first year (1983/4) was Â£76.4m. People with the nerve to invest during the early BES years seem to have deserved any money they made. The failure rate was high. At least 85 of the 227 companies funded by funds or through public prospectus la the 198/ 84 tax year failed. BES funds raised through public offer totalled Â£123m in 1984/5 and 141m nl 198/ 86. However, manufacturing was not the main bene0ldary of these funds. Investors showed a preference for asset-backed Investments such as farmland, fine wine, hotels, and property development. In an attempt to correct this and direct the money towards British trading companes, the government in 1986 Imposed restrictions on the type ofcompanies quallfying for the BES. These were aot allowed to hold more than 50 per cent of their assets in land nor could they hold collectable goods (such as wines aad antiques) for investment. Bat two years later, the government decided to use BES to get the availability of private rental property. \"It seems almost crazy,\" said one BES expert. \"After all this legislation to stop people investing in bricks and mortar, the government suddenly used the BES to get assured tenancy off the ground.\" While a number of the assured tenancy prects are as \"worthwhile\" as the manufacturing companies which originally inspired the scheme, many regard the BES today as little more than a tax shelter for low-grade property development Instead of an incentive for entrepreneurial businesses. Seymour believes the government itself regrets the way the BBS evolved. \"The tax relief on BSS was generous but the basis for investment was narrow and no one took It up. The government felt foolish so It broadened the scheme. It then regretted not refning the BES. This could have been done by limiting tax relief for companies it did not wish to encourage, such as hotels, and giving the full relief to manufacturing companies.\" Scheherazade Daneshkhu",

   "text_content" : "Home loans have been cut and special offers abound - but watch the small print, warns David Barchard ABBEY NATIONAL took the market by surprise this week when it lowered its mortgage interest rate by 0.4 percentage points to 11.55 per cent within hours of Wednesday's base rate cut. Lenders were probably plan- ning to hold out for another half point cut, but once Abbey National made its move and Halifax followed, other institu- tions had little choice. Midland Bank has undercut most banks by lowering its rate to 11.45 per cent. Lloyds Bank has cut its mortgage rate to 11.55 per cent (APR 12.2 per cent) while Royal Bank of Scotland, Woolwich, UCB, Bradford & Bingley, Nation- wide, Cheltenham & Gloucester and National & Provincial all now offer a basic rate of 11.5 per cent. Other lenders can be expected to fall in line. For most people, another half a percentage point cut is very welcome. First time buy- ers in particular should find conditions very favourable for their needs. If they borrow more than Â£60,000 they ought to be able to combine the dis- count offered to first time buy- ers with that offered by most lenders to larger borrowers. This should push their interest rate below 10 per cent. Ian Darby, marketing man- ager of John Charcol, the Lon- don mortgage brokers, says that borrowers who do this should look carefully at how long the discounts will'last. Most discounts for first time buyers last only a year - when the mortgage reverts to the full variable rate, a bor- rower might suffer a sharp jump in payments. One apparently outstanding mortgage offer to first time buyers this week comes from Yorkshire' Building Society whidh has at rate of 8.55 per cent (APR 11.80 variable) to new entrants to the mqrket, for the first 41i months. But six months is a sort time in the life of a mortgage and anyone taking'up tbise'o r should be clear about what rate they will pay after the 2.55 per cent dis- count period is over. Mortgage rates are now badk to levels last s6een in the autumn of 198. But the real question is whether interest rates are likely to fall further - if not, this is the time to go for a fixed rate, Mandy Witt, a mortgage bro- ker at Greig Middleton, points to the Cheltenham & Gloutester fixed rate mortgage as one of the best available. It offers customers 10.95 per cent (12.0 APR) Wlxed for five years. An alternative is a 9.95 per cent (12.0 APR) rate for one year on loans over Â£100,000. Two questions should be asked when looking at fixed rates. The first is what sort ofi arrangement or remortgae fees there may be. In the c0 of C&G's product Itis Â£250. Then you should; ask ibout early redemption 'enatis. These should be lm a for. ordinary variable rate, mort- gages but fixed rates tap funds purchased in advance by 6ocd- etles. If you reIeem the art age early, they are left wit the funds on their hands. In the case of C&G, there is a stiff penalty of six months' Interest. However, it is a \"portable\" mortgage: you:Qan take it vF*t Sitout penalt i you Mst terldrtgage offers are for muct 'shorter periods. Manytfer cheaper rates only for between 12 and 24 months. They mayaclarug .95 per cent 4tll June next year or 10.7.per cept until the summer of 199. the general election is not Md until next year, and; the epslronH and3 'intermt ratecuts perit well ntd1SL somie of these deals mieght't prove very advantageous:' John Charcol this week offered its customers 9.1)9 per cent (AP 12.4 per cent) fixed until January 194t usinJg fui from a buildiug society. n hLs too is a portable mortgage, with a three months early redemption penalty until 1994.

   "text_content" : "W HAT COMPANY could contemplate raising Â£37m offer- ing nothing but the right to spend a few win- ters' days out in the open fight- ing off cold Scottish winds - and require that you pay extra if you actually wish to exercise that right? That is the proposition being put forward by the deadpan Scots who run Murrayfleld, the stadium in Edinburgh where Scotland plays its international rugby matches. Gordon Masson, president of the Scottish Rugby Union, is confident that it is feasible to finance a Â£37m redevelopment of the stadium by issuing non- interest bearing debentures conferring only the right to purchase tickets for a desig- nated seat. In practice some money should come from other sources but the issue will still dwarf last year's f&5m issue for Glasgow Rangers (85 per cent subscribed so far) and this year's Â£16.5m offer for Arsenal football club (only one-third subscribed). The debenture issue is intended to enable Murrayfield both to create an all-seater sta- dium and increase capacity from 54,000 to 65,000 by the end of 1994. It will capitalise on the fact that getting seats for home internationals is virtually impossible unless you are either a member of a Scottish rugby club (and even then you usually have to take your chance in a ballot) or are one of the 7,000 people who hold either debentures issued in perpetuity in 1925 or the 20- year interest-free loan issued in 1968. How many debentures will be issued, what they will cost and how long they will last will only be decided next month when the SRU and its advisers have gauged interest from pre-registration which began on Wednesday with the opening of a hotline (0345-151515). However, prices, according to the type of seat, will proba- bly go up from about Â£1,000 to Â£3,000. Between 15,000 and 20,000 debentures are likely to be on offer. In addition there will be 1,500 seats with access to new hospitality suites. If you pre-register and buy a debenture before October 25 you will, subject to demand, be guaranteed a ticket for one home international match from next season onwards until your seat is available for occu- pation. From the organisers' point of view the beauty of the offer is that it is not a once and for all affair.The SRU can go on selling debentures until its needs are met. Unless you are interested in rugby this is probably not an investment for you. But it Is worth remembering that the 1925 debentures (issued at Â£100) change hands at about Â£7500 and the loan stock (issued at 400) for Â£2,500. James Buxton"

   "text_content" : "INVESTMENT Trust Savings Schemes seem to be an idea whose time has come. Take-up of the schemes has increased sharply since they were introduced in 1984, and companies are queuing up to offer new savings scheme products. For example, Moorgate, which specialises in smaller companies investment trusts, launches a savings option later this month. Touche Remnant, one of the biggest management groups, has announced a spe- cial offer. The Smaller Compa- nies trust, its largest, will waive its usual 1 per cent transaction charge until the end of October, for saving scheme investment. Fidelity, the fifth biggest unit trust pro- vider, will launch an invest- ment trust next month. It plans a Â£50 per month mini- mum saving scheme with no opening charge. Perhaps most ambitiously, Ivory & Sime, the largest investment trust manager in Scotland, is launching a scheme to invest with no front- end charge in any of its eight investment trusts. The mini- mum investment is Â£25. You can also invest a minimum of Â£100 into an Ivory & Sime investment trust Personal Equity Plan, thus saving tax, without charge. Why have the schemes, which have only been available as a method of buying invest- ment trust shares since 1984, suddenly become so popular? Several trusts have been around since Victoria's reign. The management has not been geared for marketing trusts to private investors, rather than institutions. As far as savers are con- cerned, a scheme is a more use- ful way to invest. Investing a lump sum introduces the prob- lem of timing. For example, if you had put Â£1,000 into a trust hIetammional General ihnetl-mnt Trusts savings shemen Over 5 years Over 10 years 1/9/86 to 1/9/86 to 2/9/91 Rank 2/9/91 Rank Alliance Bankers Second Alliance Personal Assets Foreign & Colonial Edinburgh British Tribune Scottish Mortgage Witan Â£4,752.49 1 Â£16,895.12 4 Â£4,701.49 2 Â£18,724.25 1 Â£4,675.52 3 Â£16,922.71 3 Â£4,585.62 4 - - Â£4,422.06 5 Â£17,581.16 2 Â£4.380.12 6 Â£14,643.19 10 Â£4,318.95. 7 Â£15,497.52 6 Â£4,264.65 8 Â£16,317.80 5 Â£4,196.93 9 Â£15,330.73 7 Â£4,062.02 10 Â£14,988.60 9 Sector Average Â£4,128.78 Â£16,428.73 ON r m t o M Soume: Uoropul in September 1987, just before \"Black Monday\", you would be doing a lot worse than if you invested in November 1987. Under a saving scheme \"pound-cost averaging\" works in your favour. Provided the trend is upwards, a fall in the value of your investment is good news, because you will buy more shares with your monthly amount. Low administration charges are the other big advantage. Several groups offer savings without any charge and all offer a much cheaper service than you would get buying the shares via a broker. All of this helps account for the greater interest in the schemes, although you should note that this popularity has in itself helped performance. Investment trusts are quoted shares so their value is not just determined by the value of their funds. If the shares are popular, their price will rise, even if the investment perfor- mance is not that good. Con- versely, if the market dislikes a trust, it will do badly. Over the last few years, increased buying by small investors has driven up the value of investment trust shares, and reduced the dis- count to the net value of the assets they hold. This cannot continue indefinitely. So how good is the schemes' performance? The following figures, from Micropal, are to an extent hypothetical, as the schemes only started in 1984. They 'show how your invest- ment would have fared if you had invested Â£50 per month each month for the last five, and ten years. The five-year timescale catches the worst of \"Black Monday\". Over five years, total invest- ment of Â£8,000 would on aver- age have turned into Â£3,679M.7 - not perhaps all that impres- sive. But over ten years, a total of Â£6,000 invested would on average be worth Â£13,974.40. Some trusts have done better - takidng trusts currently in the news as examples, over ten years the Moorgate trust would have turned Â£6,000 into Â£17,174.92, TR Smaller Compa- nies, would have produced Â£14.042.08, and Ivory & Sime's Investors Capital Â£15,678.08. Smaller companies trusts over ten years are the weakest sector, averaging Â£109,88, while UK Income Growth is the strongest at Â£17,126.19. Only those trusts whose managers have savings schemes are included in the table. Charges are not included and Micropal's figures are \"offer-to-offer\", so they do not take account of the spread between buying and selling prices. ,Note that under pound-cost averaging, where it is better for a trust to dip before grow- ing than to grow steadily, the precise top performers are dif- ferent. For example, on lump sum investment, Bankers comes out ahead of Alliance over ten years, according to Micropal. John Authers",

   "text_content" : "BRITISH stockbrokers this week launched a glossy pro- motional video in an effort to demystify their elitist image and woo potential clients. How- ever, on first viewing it only seems to pay lip service to the idea of serving small investors. Andrew Hugh-Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said that a quarter of the population owned shares but three-quar- ters of these held only one or two companies, mostly acquired by clipping coupons for privatisations. \"They have been at a loss in knowing how to add to those portfolios and how to look after them,\" said Hugh-Smith. \"The video will show that brokers' offices are full of approachable individuals who can handle the enquiries of ordinary individu- als, not just formidable people like Aunt Agatha.\" \"We rejected the factual route,\" said John Cobb, chair- man of the Association of Pri- vate Client Investment Manag- ers and Stockbrokers, which co-produced the video with the Stock Exchange. The 12 minute video, made by Chevron Communications, is a series of rather patronising scenes in which assorted ste- reotypes - man in pub, fruit and veg retailer, E-type Jaguar owner - discover shares and stockbroking. \"That should go down well in Scunthorpe,\" said market- maker Brian Winterflood of Winterflood Securities. \"It didn't strike one as well informed enough. Stocks and shares are for buying and sell- ing, not keeping. They are gambling counters really.\" A number of the brokers seemed to show little interest in advising truly \"mall\" cli- ents. Michael Read of Greig Midlenm sadd people shold not even look at stocks and shares unles they already ad HlOmO to IUOw i Natmnal Savi-g and bhfldig -ahoieti . Asked about the nla small privatisation sharehbMers, he said \"There are dealingnly services available for those peoiLe.

   "text_content" : "THE Teporting season continues apace next week with a crowd of big'industrial groups ranging fronlqQuxo to ols-Royce revwho*w well they have - or hae not - coped with the recession. Glaxo on Thursday is expec- ted to turn in pre-tax profits for the year ended June of around Â£1.24bn against Â£1.16bn a year earlier and an increased dividend. Margins are likely to have held up well despite heavy sales and R&D costs. Analysts will be scrutinising sales of various drug lines. Zantac, the ulcer treatment, is expected to maintain double digit volume growth. The per- formance of two new drugs, Zofran for nausea and Serevent for asthma, is of interest. Rolls-Royce's interim pre-tax profits on Thursday are expec- ted to be almost wiped out compared to last year's Â£115m. Even optimists expect only Â£25m pre-tax. The plunge is caused mainly by a slowdown in civil aerospace following a fall in demand for spare parts. The company is expected to be confident enough to maintain the dividend at 2.55p. Will British , Aerospace spring a rights issue on Wednesday? Speculation of one has caused recent weakness in the share price.'Interim pre-tax profits are expected to slump to about Â£110m (Â£146m). There is a chance of a dividend rise, however, to 9.8p (8.9p). Cadbury Schweppes is likely to report on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits ahead slightly to about Â£112m (Â£104.7m). Confectionery has fared well in the UK but less well in places like Australia. Beverages, hit by poor weather and the recession, will look weak in comparison with last year's very strong first half. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining com- pany, is expected to report on Thursday interim pre-tax prof- its down as much as 40 per cent to Â£164m. RTZ draws more than one- third of its profit from copper, which has fallen in price from a 1990 average of $1.21 a lb to about $1.06 so far this year.",

   "text_content" : "Before you ask how well an investment will perform, you need to decide what'yon want it to achieve. There is no point* 1 Investing a sum which will grow immensely after 25 years if what you really want Is an income each month. Over the next month, the Weekend FT will examine such choices. This week, we look at investing for income. Future articles will examine investing for growth, security, and saving tax. Each week we'will offer ten suggestions. These lists will not be exhaustive, but they should tell you how to tailor financial products to your own needs, rather than those of the companies which provide them. T HE MOST popular way of investing for income is to sell your labour to somebody else, who pays you a regular salary in return. Few investments will outper- form a salary, although they should require less effort. Investing for income is, classi- cally, done by those who have a large capital sum but little regular income: pensioners. If you are receiving a salary, it might be best to keep your savings long-term and aim for growth. If you do this through a pension you can do so very tax-efficiently, provided that you convert your fund into income when you retire. This method of investing for income is hard to beat if you are pre- pared to wait a while. If you need to turn your money into a reasonably imme- diate income, the following might be of interest: STemporary annuities. Issued by life offices, temporary annu- ities allow you to spread a sum of capital over a fixed period, usually nine years. You pay a lump sum to the life office, which agrees to pay you a fixed sum for each of the nine years. The office keeps the money if you die before the annuity expires. These offer you the highest income in rela- tion to the money you pay in of any product, because unlike most of the other investments covered here, they repay capital. Rates offered vary depending on your chances of surviving the full term of the annuity - the older you are, the more you will be paid. Life offices guar- antee payments, which means that the investment revolves around gilts. If the gilts market is strong at the time you start your investment, you should get better value. The best buy at present, according to Baronworth Investment Services, assuming a down payment of Â£10,000 by a 70-year-old man, is Â£2,096 per year, over nine years, by Sun Alliance. @ Immediate annuities: The other classic income-producing vehicle from life offices. In this case, the office promises to pay you a sum each year until you die. If you die soon after the investment is made, the insur- ers keep the money. Annuities are thus a disqui- eting investment, as you are effectively taking a bet on how long you will live. You get bet- ter value the older you become. At 75, they should be good value, and at 80, they are excellent. Baronworth's best buy, on the same assumptions as for a temporary annuity, is Â£1,570.40, from Co-op Insurance. s Unit trusts: The sector to aim for is UK Income. Fund managers invest in high-yield- ing companies - those which they expect to pay out a high dividend in relation to their share price. If the managers get it right, the trusts will make large income pay-outs each year, while their capital value improves. However, the tax position is not to good, as basic rate tax will be deducted. You can reclaim it if you are a non- taxpayer, but this takes time and effort. A typical net return at present is around 5.5 per cent, according to Julia Whittle of Chase De Vere. Good sinan- cial advisers should be able to \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t set up a unit trust income plan, investing in several trusts, timed so that you would receive a monthly income. Although designed to max- imise income, income trusts regularly come near the top of performance tables for growth, provided you re-invest the income each year. Thus they are a hard investment to fault - if you find you do not need the income, it should be easy to plough it back into the trust and store up extra growth for John Authers introduces a new series on investingfor specific needs the future. Historically good performers in this sector include Capel Income, Key Income and Capability Income. s Investment trusts: The new \"split-capital\" investment trusts cater for investors with specific needs. The mechanics behind them are complex, but the upshot for the investor is that some shares - zeros - pay no dividend at all, while people holding other shares - known as income shares - receive all of the distribution. This makes for a hefty regular income. The capital value of income shares dwindles as trusts move towards their expiry date, but this form of investment has much to recommend it. There is also much interest in these trusts from companies, with offerings coming recently from Gartmore and Kleinwort Benson. * Gilts, or UK government bonds, can make sense for pro- viding an income in certain cir- cumstances. They are tax-effi- cient if you pay capital gains tax and can also be bought very cheaply, via the National Savings Stock Register. You only need to fill in a form from the post office. However, they are not very interesting for taxpayers, as income tax must be paid at your highest marginal rate. If you do not pay tax, however, you might be tempted - little can go wrong with gilts and they do offer the possibility of capital growth. * International bonds. The argument in favour of interna- tional bonds is that most for- eign bonds look slightly better than UK gilts at present. The problem is that buying interna- tional bonds is more expensive, hence you have to pay more charges. International bond unit trusts, of which many have been launched this year, can help, although you may dislike the front end fee, which is sometimes as high as 6 per cent. Real yields (accounting for inflation) should be higher than on UK gilts, if you can handle the administration charges. * Guaranteed income bonds: A form of investment which has come into vogue recently, mainly thanks to falling inter- est rates. GIBs are offered mostly by small life companies, with growth, and income pay- ments, guaranteed from the outset. Terms from one to five years are available. GIBs are not good value for non-taxpayers, as they are paid net of basic rate tax. Also note that in gen- eral, you receive better value the more money you invest at the outset. \"Best buys\" over each term from one to five years are pub- lished each week in the Best Rates for your Money table in the Weekend FT. It is impor- tant to shop around for the best rates, so independent advisers score heavily. The two which are most energetic in selling GIBs are Baronworth, based in Ilford, Essex, and Chase De Vere, based in Lon- don. Both track the rates on offer regularly. The best rate at present is 9.65 per cent over five years from Providence Capitol (if you invest Â£25,000 or more). If you only invest Â£1,000 you can still receive 8.8 per cent over three or four years from Premium Life. * Personal Equity Plms: Not all Peps are ideal for income. For many investors, their greatest attraction is the free- dom they give you to re-invest dividends free of income tax, allowing fast growth. However, some Pes have been specifically designed to provide a high yel by invest- ing in high-yielding blue chip companies and Income shares of investment trusts. Those suggested by Chase De Vere include Fleming High Income and Framllngton High Income. They currently offer a yield of around 7.7 per cent. 1 Single Premium Insurance Bonds: These come in different forms from numerous life offices. They can be used as income-producers, because you can withdraw 5 per cent of the original value of your invest- ment each year, free of tax. However, it is as well to choose an insurance company with a good investment performance. As with all life assurance-de- rived products, charges can be steep. Some are unit-linked, and others \"with-proflts\" - not all offices can offer both. Unit-linked bonds should offer better performance in the long term. Bonds have more flexibility than most insurance products, as they can be encashed in full or in part at any time (although you should watch out for the bid/offer spread). Make sure you get a rebate on commission, as you can from most good advisers. * National Savings Income Bonds: An ultra-cautious -but sensible investment, if you do not pay tax. Income bonds will from next week offer 11 per cent gross,'but only 8.25 per cent net. They are thus quite easily bettered if you pay tax. Minimum investment is Â£2,000, with. a maximum of Â£25,000. Withdrawals of capital, and new investments, must be in multiples of Â£1,000. Monthly interest is paid into your bank account, providing a steady supplement to income. Capital values will stay constant in nominal terms, although they will be eroded by inflation. You must give three months' notice before withdrawing capital, which must also be done in multiples of Â£1,000."

   "text_content" : "Dryden Gilling-Smith looks at alterations to self-administered pension schemes P ROPERTY HAS for many years been a popular investment for the trustees of small self-administered pen- sion schemes. Those directors who are trustees of their own SSASs ( often called director plans) and who plan to buy their own business premises should take note of the Inland Revenue reg- ulations which came into effect on August 5. The new rules govern a scheme's ability to raise mortgage finance and an embargo on transactions with members. A director might, for exam- ple, own business premises, which he currently leases to his company. He could plan to sell these premises to the pen- sion scheme and use the pro- ceeds to increase his compa- ny's share capital. When he retires and takes his tax-free lump sum from the pension scheme, he could buy the prop- erty back. This option is now off the menu. At one stage the Reve- nue draft regulations would have prevented schemes sell- ing existing properties back to director member or their fami- lies. It was pointed out that in some cases it might be extremely diffcult to find buy- ers. The Revenue therefore agreed to keep the rules for investments made before July 15. A scheme can sell its shop, office, warehouse or farmland to an individual directortmem- ber at an arm's length price based on an independent pro- sessional valuation. The Revenue says the rules will be applied rigorously. Any- one who attempts to get \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t around the embargo by finding a third party who would buy from the trustees and sell on to the member, will be caught by the words \"directly or indi- rectly\". In practice, the third party would have to hold the investment for a minimum of three years before selling it. While the regulations may seem strict in some respects, they will not adversely affec the majority of normal prop- erty investments by SSAS director/trustees. It is impor- tant to differentiate the prop- erty investment opprtuniti of large pension schemes and the SSAS. Large schemes, insurance companies, etc, have tended in recent years to pull out of the small rows of sha and office units on the grounds that they are more labour intensive to administer and maintain than large city centre Meks In contrast, the directors of a company which has built up a small local chain of retail shops, will usually have a shrewder judgment of the potential value of each site, than the sort of employee who would handle this level of transaction in a big property The company, as tenants, will have every interest to keep the premises in tiptop condi- tion and to pay proper rent (the Revenue insists on this in any case) because the money is all going into the directors' penion pot Director/trustees planning new property investments must also bear in mind the draft regulations the Deport- meat of Social Security, which are designed for member pro- tection. \"Self-investment\" in property used in the employ- er's business *r require all the members to be trustees and a unanimous resolution signed by all the trustees before al liture purchases of this kind can be made. Director/trustees are not too worried about short-term fluc- thations in property values, but more with their strategic long term objectives. Some companies, particu- larly family companies, have enough young directors in the scheme to ensure that there is always enough liquidity to pay out the benefits of the older directors when they retire, without having to sell the property. In other cases, direc- tors take the view that if their business should go bust, their most valuable asset, their premises, is beyond the ranch of creditors. Other businesses may be being built up with a view to sale when the market is right. If the company buys the prop- erties directly, so that capital gains ae reflected in the share price, the director/owners would pay capital gains tax. However, if on takeover, the SSAS sells the premises to the organisation that buys the company, the directors will enjoy the tax-free gain in the form of better retirement bene- ffts. For these and many other reasons, SSASs have enjoyed much better returns on their property investments than n- sion schemes as a whole. Such \"special situation\" property investments are therefore likely to remain popular with SSA trustees, even though those that are now being forced to sell may wish they had pulled out two or three Another difference from a aM e p -oa hnd is the vir- tl ear that the Revenue has placed for some years on SSASs investing in residential property, regardless of its investment merits. The Reve- nue has taken the view that residential property offers scope for the provision of bene- fits-in-kind to directors. While this might simply be a matter of prohibiting invest- ment in villas in such places as Provence or the Algarve, the Revenue has taken the view that they do not have the resources to police the way in which vast numbers of small rpptie e being occupied. They have therefore tended to take a hard line, but this has caused problems where small flats form put of a block of shops or orfices, and there has been a lot of argument on indi- vidual cases. The new regulations on this point are an improvement. They allow an exception to the embargo on residentila prop- erty where either an uncon- nected employee is required to occupy residential premises as a condition of employment - eg a caretaker - or where someone unrelated to the direc- tor/member, or other \"con- nected persons\", rent the prem- ises as part of a package deal with the business premises. Thus, the trustees can buy a shop with an integral flat and grant the combined tenancy to a shopkeeper, or put in their own manager who can have the flat to go with the job, even though there is no legal requirement that he should occupy ft in the capacity as cuare e mr.

   "text_content" : "I HAVE a portfolio of shares which at 1982 values was worth Â£78000. I want to make. a lifetime gift to my children and hope to survive seven years. Is there CGT liability in makina this gift on the amumption that the portfo has matched the FT Index in performanem over the period? * There will be no tax liability f broadly speaking: (a) the market value of each shareholding on the day of the gift (on the quarter-up basis) does not exceed its March 31 1982 value by more than the rise in the RPI from March 1982. This was 168.0 per cent. (b) Your portfolio does not include: i) shares in companies which have at any time been non-qualifying offshore funds; ii) qualifying corporate bonds received in exchange for shares; ill) deep-gain or deep-discount securities. If some shares have beaten the RPI but others have lagged behind it (something which you will not, of course, know precisely until some weeks after the gift), then the offsetting of allowable losses against chargeable gains will be restricted. Broadly speaking, losses on shares given to one of your children can only be set against gains on shares given to that particular child.

I am leaving instructions that on my death the entire portfolio is to be sold and the proceeds used as soon as possible to buy an annuity. The problem is that this takes time and the Income is essential to make mortgage payments. The executor (a solicitor) should have no problem selling my wife's shares, but: 1) would he need to wait for probate to sell mine? 2) if so (my will simply leaves my estate to my wife) how long should probate take?

' It seems clear from what you say that the whole of the income from the shares in your wife's name is taxable as part of your own income, under section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It seems likely that the capital gains arising on disposals of shares in her name fall to be treated as your own gains (although the CGT legislation is not as clear as section 674A of the Taxes Act). There may therefore be little or no point in continuing to register shares in your wife's name, in the circumstances which you outline. The answers to your questions, brefly. 1) Not necessarily, but he might prefer to do so. 2) Only a few weeks, if everything is straightforward. 3) The interest paid to the executor will be paid over to your wife, as part of the final distribution of your estate. 4) We suggest that you talk things over with the solicitor concerned, including section 674A of the Taxes Act 1988. You may like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlet . IR45 (income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax: what happened when someone dies). Correction The last paragraph in the answer to the question headed 'Transfer of Shares' in Q&A on August 24, should have read, \"If the distribution took place before April 6 1988, your wife is probably entitled to have half the held over gain ignored, by virtue of schedule 9 to the Finance Act 1988.\"",

   "text_content" : "O 150 per cent pay rises for Alan Smith. He draws Â£150 a week from Notting- ham Custom Cycles, the com- pany he started formally with Tiiothy Lee, his partner, in January 1986. They rode off into an uncertain future with a Barclays overdraft of Â£1,000, a welding machine worth roughly the same amount and a government enterprise allow- ance of Â£40 a Week. Custom Cycles is a hobby which went commercial. Smith used to fix up his own motor- cycle and the motorcycles of his friends in a room at the back of a pub. \"We got busier and busier. Why not make a business out of it?\" he said. Now Custom Cycles takes production motor- cycles and rebuilds them to the specifications of the owner; it makes the parts which turn production models into individ- ual machines. In the year to April 1990, Custom Cycles made pretax profits of Â£16,000 on a turnover of Â£63,000. In the last financial year turnover rose to Â£80,000, but profits will turn out lower than 1989-90, despite hefty price rises, because of reinvest- ment in the business. To bring the business up to this level, Smith has had help from three quarters. First, there was Barclays Bank which in earlier, easier credit days was prepared to back him. Second, there was Back Street Heroes magazine which put the company into contact with a wider riding public: an early advertisement produced dramatic results - \"we were shocked by the response, it (the business) took off from there.\" Third, there was the Nottinghamshire County Coun- cil: when Custom Cycles out- grew its first 425 square feet premises the council provided a Â£6,000 loan to help a move to larger premises and a rent grant for the first year. These premises are on two Paul Cheeseright visits a company which customises motorbikes storeys in a back street of north Nottingham and they cost Â£4,500 a year, plus the uni- form business rate of about Â£800. But Custom Cycles - that is Smith, his wife, his brother, two men on employ- ment training and one employee - does most of its work in and around the orderly jumble of bike parts on the ground floor. Lee is seen less these days; he has health prob- lems. But whether Custom Cycles can stay where it is, or can remain in the same line of business, is difficult to predict. In spite of a dire spell of busi- ness before and after last Phristmas, this uncertainty is less to do with recession than the nature of the choices Smith will have to make. The background problem is one that he can do little about directly. The European Com- munity plans new motorcycle regulations which, in their pro- posed form, could make illegal the sort of customised bikes and parts that are Custom Cycles' very reason for its exis- tence. \"Customers are saying 'will I be able to ride this after 1993?'\" Smith said. But there are other immedi- ate questions to be answered if Custom Cycles is to grow. Smith has gone as far as he can with the business in its present form. \"What we could do with is a big cash injection to expand,\" he acknowledged. But that begs the question of the nature of the expansion. There is, for example, oppor- tunity for a shop at the Custom Cycles works - \"we have the space but not the stock\", and no desire to borrow, even if that were possible, to obtain it. Greater benefit, too, could be obtained from manufacturing the special parts. The business now is, as Smith put it, \"one- off stuff\"; it would make sense instead of making one, to make FIghUng the aiiw poposed EC Igition could make the motorblkes Alan mnntproauces uilegal 10, \"but there's never enough time to sort it out.\" Herein lies the further prob- lixi: that Smith, as he admits, is running to stand still. \"It's hard to find time to sit down and plan the business properly. I'm doing it when I'm half- asleep,\" he confessed. The solu- dion is to train people who can do his technical work, leaving him time to develop the busi- ness. But there is no quick fix. \"My brother is almost there now. He's almost taken the place of Timothy Lee. But it will need another two or three years for the ET guys.\" The decisions, though, will not wait. Custom Cycles is in the last year of its 1ease. If it decides to stay it could rent out the upper storey to a com- plementary business to cut overheads. Ideally, it would like to buy the premises.This depends on the bank manager: 18 months ago Barclays said it would back Custom Cycles to buy the premises. Now there is a different manager who Smith does not know. Beyond that the banks are stricter on finance, as Custom Cycles found nine months ago when it stepped across its over- draft limit of Â£4,000. Smith would like a more generous limit but cannot provide the security required by the bank. Not only does he want a capi- tal injection, he would also like more elastic financial limits. It is not surprising then that he cannot yet afford to buy his own home. * Nottingham Custom Cycles, 4A Patterson Rd, Rad- ford, Nottingham NG7 6AS. Tel 0602-782871.",

   "text_content" : "THE relationship between small businesses and their banks can grow strained in a recession. Jane Bradford, head of National Westminster's Small Business Service, puts the bank's point of view. HOW LONG will the bank sup- port me through the recession? This is a question in the minds of many entrepreneurs as the recession bites, with an upturn still some way off. To answer the question there are three main points to consider; first, the impact of the recession on small businesses, sec- ond, the effect on lending risk and yield, and third, the knock-on in terms of the withdrawal of loan facilities. The recession has had a severe effect on small businesses but we have set this in the context of the market place as a whole. The number of businesses has increased from some 2.5m to 3m since 1984 - the year of the last peak of bankruptcies and liquidations. While financial failures (as measured by bankruptcies and liquida- tions) are at record levels they still repre- sent less than 2 per cent of the total busi- ness market. Furthermore, there is a traditionally high birth and death rate. Some 500,000 businesses started and 450,000 businesses left the market in both 1989 and 1990. One in three new businesses will cease trading within three years - the percentage of those withdrawing from business has var- ied little from good years to bad. A recession increases risk for all those in business - banks included. In recent months, banks have taken on an even higher degree of small business risk as the level of bank loans to owners' equity has increased. In many cases the bank has invested in the buliness than the owner, leaving only a small margin for error when problems arise. This has been an important feature in the level of bad debt provision reporteu by banks in recent weeks. The recessioni has not respected age, size or pature of business, although the effects have varied widely between individual businesses; some report trading to be good in the same. sector and even the ',sme locality where others are struggling... Against this .background, banks havi been faced witlithe dilemma of whethertSvt reduce risk by withdrawing support frtoqi more marginal businesses or to compen- sate by seeking ia higher return, NatWest decided to maintain its support for small businesses rather t bawing it, but the bank had to increase its margin on the money leant to reflect the increased risk. However, on average, the margins charged by banks were nowhere near as high as 'hose reported in some press comment. The Chancellor confirmed this in his investigations, revealing that the average interest margin for small businesses over- all is 2.5-3.5 per cent (3.5-4.5 per cent for the smallest, companies) with base rate reductions passed on directly in the major- ity of instances. In the 25 per cent of cases where the bank has increased margins the pical 0.5 nt rise represents a mod- of Â£75 a year on Nat- f-st's ave of Â£15,000This will be more than offset by the 4 per cent fall in base rates which:ias brought a saving of Â£600 a year in strates, -M. - :.- I. :H 'inWi Small businesses are experiencing a sav- age downturn in trading conditions, result- ing in curtailed profit and cash flows. However, the decision to call in overdrafts and loans is never taken lightly particu- larly, as for most small firms, it is family assets which are at risk. NatWest increased its lending to small businesses by Â£1.5bn in the year to March, a 20 per cent rise mainly to provide additional working capital. Inevitably, some loans and overdrafts will be called in. It makes no sense to anyone for support to be .extended beyond the point of no return. But it is tragic if a business fails through lack of communica- tion and it is essential to keep the bank closely advised of trading performance, particularly so that problems can be antic- ipated and corrective action taken. Nevertheless, banks have a strong inter- est in the financial well-being of their small business customers. In providing banking services nationally through a retail network of 2,900 branches, NatWest needs a stock of business customers to run its own business effectively. Therefore, the bank has an interest in its customers' suc- cess, and failure is seen as a very sad waste of resources for all concerned. The recession has been tough going for customer and bank manager alike, but NatWest has supported small businesses wherever possible. It remains firmly com- mitted to the small business sector and continues to look for fresh opportunities. Growth with quality is our objective. In the short term this has meant taking on a greater degree of risk, as evidenced by the bank's high level of bad debt provision for small businesses. That said, the lesson of the recession and the small business debate is a need for greater two-way com- munication between bank and customer.",

   "text_content" : "Edmund Penning-Rowsell asks if Champagne is too pricy UDDENLY, the Champagne region has lost some of its fizz. In the 1980s noth- ing, it seemed, could go wrong. Between 1980 and 19869 sales rose by 43 per cent and exports by 68 per cent. Exports to the UK - its lead. ing market - rose by 170 per cent. But the restricted area in which grapes for Champagne may be grown was almost all planted by 1989. Since supply was limited, prices tended to rise. However, in the last 18 months the climate around the Marne has become unsettled. In March last year the arrange- ment by which growers sell a high proportion of their crop to a syndicate of Champagne makers failed to be agreed. The growers would offer only 42 per cent of the crop to the syndicate, largely because they expected higher prices for the balance. So the syndicate cancelled the agreement altogether. Last year the Champagne makers tried to restrict the rise in grape prices by recommending a price of FFr32 per kilo for the top districts (20 per cent higher than in the previous year) and agreeing that their purchases should not exceed the quantity of grapes used to produce the previous year's sale of the wine. The recommended price was frequently exceeded by bonuses that added another FFr3 or FFr4 a kilo. What had been forecast as a short vintage after frost turned out to be the third biggest in Champagne's history. In spite of the rise in prices all the harvest was sold. Another uncertainty was brought about by the purchase in December of Pommery and Lanson by the LVMH group which already included four champagne houses, headed by Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot - a re-organisation completed in March by the resale of Lanson, less its vineyards, to the big own-label champagne company of Marne et Champagne and Allied-Lyons, long keen to secure at least a foot in the Champagne door. Rival Champagne producers and growers have not been at all happy about a consortium that sold almost one in every four bottles of champagne and whose ultimate financial control was outside the region. Then came the unexpected steep drop in sales in the second half of last year: a fall of 6 per cent, with exports down 10 per cent. But worse was to come this year. For the first three months sales in France were 21 per cent down, and abroad 29 per cent. UK imports were almost halved. This was partly attributed to the Gulf War, but this seemed not all that direct an influence in Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand where similar drops occurred. The figures for the half year to June were not much better: down 18 per cent overall, with domestic sales down 14 per cent and exports 25.5 per cent. The UK drop was 45 per cent although narrowly it still tops the export list, a little ahead of Germany, which has registered the smallest fall - under 4.5 per cent. The reasons for the drop in Britain's extraordinary record of champagne consumption are debatable, but the most popular thesis is that it has become too expensive, reflecting a cumulative rise of almost 50 per cent in grape prices during the last three years. Early this year, and even before, grande marque consumers were alarmed by talk of a Â£20-a-bottle price. This may now apply to champagnes considered exceptional, such as Bollinger and Roederer, but the non-vintage wines of such reliable houses as Deutz, Alfred Gratien, Charles Heidsieck, Lanson, Joseph Perrier and Laurent Perrier, to name a few, can still be found well below Â£20. By far the biggest brand seller in the UK is Moet & Chandon, selling around 20 per cent of the total: 4.3m bottles last year, yet 300,000 fewer than in 1989. Since January 1990 Moet has raised its price by 29 per cent in three stages, although it absorbed the 1990 rise in VAT and Excise duty. After inflation, this represents a real increase of 16 per cent. The shelf price of Moet Brut Imperial N.V. is now reckoned to be between Â£17.79 and Â£17.99. The main reasons why some other supermarket champagnes are much lower in price is that they buy cheaper, less fine grapes and the second pressings, and they market their wines well before three years in bottle: the minimum considered vital to maintain the quality of champagne. The legal minimum is one year. LUJ GLYN GOODWIN With sales so sharply down, might cheaper grapes be expected in the coming vintage? Almost certainly not, although they are highly unlikely to cost more. Merchants are still thirsty for grapes, the big groups are not averse to squeezing the smaller houses, and since the breakdown of the contract system, more intimate relations have been formed between merchants and growers that they would not want to lose too quickly. Further, any cut in prices that might continue or extend over one or two years would lead to stock revaluations, running in many cases to millions of bottles. But a continued sales decline might affect grape prices next year.",

   "text_content" : "CHEZ ONESIME is not a restaurant you will just stum- ble across. It is in the heart of the Pays Basque in the village of Donoztiri - or St Esteben to give its French name - near Hasparren and a fair distance frdm the tourist honeypots. There is not much of note in the village - parish would be a more accurate term since it is so spread out - except the church and the fonton (pelota court). But if you are making the rounds of the Basque vil- lages and hamlets that sur- round Hasparren, and autumn is a beautiful time to be there, the restaurant is worth a detour for its rich and care- fully prepared food and pleas- ant atmosphere. Jacques Salles is the chef and his Basque wife is the mri- assse d' in what was her famn ily home. Entering the cool, timbered dining room on a blisteringly- hot Sunday lunchtime was a delightful experience. A pile of cookbooks dating back to the last century sits on a chest near the door. The walls are hung with china and old fam- ily photographs. Candlesticks and copper pots gleam in a lacy and flowery room which has care and attention written all over. By French standards it is not cheap. Set menus are FFri0S (Â£13) and FFr230 and you could pay considerably more if you order from the coar. The wine list is Bordeaux dominated but local Irouldguy and Madiran are offered along with a ofn de table at FFr50. The food has freshness and quality. The snag is in the limita- tions that the menu imposes. I am not against small menus, but when it is hard to avoid having jbfe gras in one form or another as a starter then that restricts one's other choices - particularly as you will almost certainly want the excellent meat or game as a main course. The lamb, especially - I assume it is local - is top- class. Five fish dishes are offered. again all are quite rich. I would like to return and try the Zar- zuella, a fish stew that is com- mon to the region. Cheese is interesting - small hot goats' cheese with a nut salad and the region's famous ewe's milk cheese, Bre- bis is served with a cherry con- fiture. The five desserts (roubhly FFr4O) manage to avoid gateau Basque. The sor- bet is particularly good.

Scrooge-like amounts are neccessary until You get used to the strange and distinctive, but undeflnable, taste of its vibrant green leaves (a eah aromatic sourness is as close as I can get). Then the appetite for it grows, and you find you cannot do without it. I do not think coriander is truly addictive, in the clinical sense of a drug like nutmeg, and it is not the sort of flavouring ybou would want to add to everything, but it does seem to enhance many foods particularly well. Fish, chicken, eggs and vegetables are notable examples. This list, tying in as it does with today's trend for lmes red meat in the diet, makes coriander a natural favourite for the 1990s. Coriander is crucial to cooking in many parts of the world, as common to other cuisines as parsley is to ours, and it is used in those coun- tries far more frequently and more lavishly than we use parsley. Chinese and south-east Asian cooks, for example, team coriander with ginger and garlic to great effect. In India it is scattered coolly over such things as raita, mangoes and dahl, and it forms the basis of a wonderful fresh green chutney. In Mexico and Latin America coriander is as basic as chilli peppers, beans, avocados and maize. In Europe only the Portuguese have a long tradition of cooking with coriander, a prized ingredient ever since spice traders brought it back from the east in the 15th century. Coriander is important to the character of the recipe which follows, a caldeimada or fish stew. The Portuguese love this sort of dish and make it using whatever they catch, from eels to sardines, and salt cod too. In celebration of the fact that there is an R in the month and wild mussels are back on sale, I suggest using a mixture of molluscs, white fish and squid. Potatoes are often included in caldeirada or the stew is ladled out on to thick slices of toasted or fried bread for serving. Red peppers are another popular ingredient, lending colour as well as flavour to the dish, and they make a particularly good choice at this time of year. The addition of aili, although not authentic, provides a rich finishing touch. A robust and simple fish stew of this sort is high on my list of favourite foods for informal entertaining. It is true that a fair amount of preparatory work is involved but the prepara- tions can be done well ahead. The cooking itself is neither lengthy nor complicated. A first course is unnecessary before such a substantial dish. All that needs to precede it Is some sort of bonne bouche to nibble with pre- dinner drinks - something like bruschetta, pro- sciutto-wrapped grissini dukka, slices of salami and a dish of olives or freshly salted almonds. 'Follow the stew simply with salad and hsse, and something small, fresh, fruity and itght, rather than a rich sweet. A damson ice, figs with raspberry purde, poached pears or a comp6te of mangoes and pomegranates would do very well. PORTUGUESE FISH STEW (serves 6) 3 lb mussels; 2 lb small squid; 2 lb fillet of hake, haddock or cod; 3 red peppers; 2 onions; %pt fish stock; 8 fl oz white wine; a little olive oil; 1 garlic clove; 1 bay leaf; a large bunch of corian- der; '/%pt not too garlicky ai6li (optional); 6 thick slices of stale bread, toasted or fried (optional). The preparations that can be done ahead are as follows. Make the aief and a good fish stock. Scrub the mussels and put them Into a bucket of heavily salted water (adding, maybe, a spoonful of oatmeal or maize meal for the mol- luses to feed on). Clean the squid, slice the body sacs into thin rings and cut the tentacles into short lengths if long. Check the fish for bones then cut the fillets into 2 inch chunks - leave the skin on as it helps to hold the fish together as it cooks, De-seed and chop the peppers. Cut the onions into chunks. Chop the garlic finely Philippa Davenport sings the praises of ever more popular coriander and snip at least 8 tablespoons of coriander leaves. When ready to cook heat 2 or 3 tablespoon of olive oil in a stewpan and fry the peppers and onions for about 4 minutes over fairly high heat. Add the stock, wine, garlic, bay leaf, some salt and pepper and simmer gently without a lid for 10 minutes. While the vegetables are cooking, open the mussels, shaking them over high heat in a separate tightly-lidded pan containing a splash of water. Add the chunks of fish to the stewpan, cover and poach over the lowest possible heat for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile discard any mussels that have not opened and half-shell the rest. Strain the mussel liquor. Add it to the stew- pan together with the squid and coriander leaves. Cook for a minute or so more, taking great care to keep the heat minimal or the squid may turn into albino rubber bands. Away from the heat, stir in 2-3 tablespoons of aidli and check seasoning. Ladle the stew into a hot casserole for bringing to table, adding some of the mussels after each ladleful. Serve in deep soup plates, each one lined with a thick slice of toasted or fried bread, and hand round the remaining aiwli in a small bowl. Leftovers, should there be any, can be thinned down with more stock to make a soup next day.",

   "text_content" : "HE SMALL but unspoilt town of Wer- nigerode lies just over the old border between what used to be West and East Germany. For years its rarity value as one of the DDR's few pretty towns made it a Mecca for East German tourists. With four or five old-fashioned hotels and the usual bars and cafes it could just about manage; almost all of Wernigerode's eating places shut up shop when the tourists lumbered back to their buses and trundled back to Magde- burg, Leipzig or East Berlin. Seven months after unifica- tion only two of Wernigerode's hotels are still open. As in other parts of east Germany, disputes over property owner- ship have led to a decline in tourist facilities at the very moment when they are required to deal with a flood of new visitors from the west. You may be lucky to find a bed at the Hotel zur Fost or the Weisser Hirsch but I cannot promise a bundle of laughs. It was, however, in Wernigerode that I heard a story which could become emblematic of life in what the Germans refer to as the Neue Lnde. Just by the cute, old town hall is the Cafm Wien. It has been a Kanditorvl (cafe) for a century or more. In 1936 it became the property of the Sie- gemunde family who kept it going throughout the war years until it was nationalised in 1951. After unification last year, the Siegemundes got their cafe back. Once again they are making the best cakes in Wernigerode. There may be parallels to the Siegemunde story in other parts of east Germany, but they do not leap at you. As far as hotels and restaurants are concerned, those which used to be run by the state or the trades unions exist in a kind of limbo: some have closed, oth- ers await news of their new ownership. In general the Ostdeutscher's reaction to unification has been small-scale consolidation. The man in the street sees the 41 years of the DDR as a time when he was denied the plea- sures available to his cousins in the west. Now he too can enjoy oranges, just as he can obtain Giles MacDonogh tries the food in east Germany and finds the Italians want a slice of the action cable television, cars and video tapes. Developments in the food business have been small scale: mobile sausage stalls; a microwave or a chipper for the pub; there is not much spirit of adventure. Sadly, most of the entrepreneurial brains left long ago for the west. Where change has occurred it has often been the Italians who have been the quickest to see the potential of this new market. The Italians have been the only outsiders to obtain a site in the centre of Berlin. In Leipzig a mysterious \"Gui- seppe\" is now serving \"real Italian food\" in the Bistro am Br(hl. Even in one of the east's most tragically gloomy cities, Nordhausen, where only one shabby 1960s hotel remains open, a piza-ristorante is open- ing next to the derelict Stadt Terrasse. Tourism was never the DDR's forte; the rare cultural event in an east German town stretched hotels to beyond their capacity. I discovered this myself in Halle when I arrived at the same time as the Handel competition. I was sorry about having to move on as Halle struck me as being one of the few east German cities to pos- sess personality. There were also plenty of small shops cafes and bars. The reverse side of the coin was possibly Magdeburg; a city knocked flat by the RAF on January 16 1945. In Magde- burg's all pervading gloom I found it hard to believe there would be anything to do in the evening; the Stalinist \"Prag\" restaurant had gone out of business at the time of reunifi- cation and I do not imagine that the Moskwa, in the Hotel Stadt Magdeburg, will retain its Russian sheen long after the state Inter Hotels have found a buyer. But even in the wind-swept desolation of modern Magde- burg I was delighted to find a small corner of the old town still standing and there, in Breiter Strasse was a restau- rant called \"Savarin\"; a tribute I imagined to the gastronomic writer Brillat-Savarin. I pushed open the door. There was not a free table to be found, but the fierce propri- etor made a place for me at the bar. I had a modest meal of potato cream soup; a pork Schnitzel with fresh, ivory white asparagus all moistened with good local beer. The \"Savarin\" story had to be simi- lar to that of the Siegemunde. Slowly this slumbe corner of Europe's past must be stag- gering to its feet",

   "text_content" : "Anthony Curtis muses on the Frieda/Lawrence affair s EVERY schoolgirl knows, Lawrence and Frieda (wife of Professor Ernest Weekley of Nottingham) eloped. But did they? This new biography - the first to be written in the light of the com- plete Lawrence Letters also being published by Cambridge - enables us .to reconstruct the precise sequence of events culminating in that famous Anglo-German union. What happened was this. Lawrence met Frieda for the first time in March 1912. Law- rence was 26, Frieda older by six years, and mother of three children. He had recently established a reputation as a writer among the cognoscenti with The White Peacock. Ford Maddox Ford had picked up the manuscript of that novel from a heap of submissions, read it straight through, and, revealing his fine editorial flair, had told the author that, in spite of its many faults, he was a genius. In addition Law- rence had written poems, plays, short stories and was at work on another novel, all of them based on his experience as the breakaway son of a Not- tinghamshire miner. By now he had indeed com- pletely broken away from that background. His mother had died in 1910, just in time, before she went, to be given his first book. Bert - as he was known in the family - had been a pupil teacher after which he had been a student at University College, Notting- ham where Weekley was a pro. fessor. Lawrence then became a schoolmaster at a school in Croydon. While he was in that job he wrote in his spare time, and had a web of complicated relations with various women colleagues and former student friends from Nottingham, to one of whom, Louisa Burrows, he had become engaged. He then had a severe attack of pneumonia from which he nearly died. It was in the period of conva- lescence from this' illness that DHL the writer was formed. He never went back to teaching. He found a firm support forhis career and a confidant in the selfless Edward Garnett. From the perspective of the Garnett's country house, the Cearne in southern England, Lawrence was able to see his life from a fresh angle: he began by break- ing off his engagement to Louisa Burrows. But he 'felt he had to do something while continuing to write his books and his thoughts turned to trying to become a lektor at a German university. Weekley in his youth had held just such a post and Lawrence applied to him D H LAWRENCE: THE EARLY YEARS 1885-1912 by John Worthen Cambridge Â£25, 626 pages for advice. He was invited to Sunday lunch in March 1912, the only time he ever met Weekley, and the first time he met Frieda. Lawrence's former girl- friends, people like Jessie Chambers and Louisa Burrows, were, as John Worthen makes abundantly clear, remarkable young women, a heroic band of precursors of today's vast army of English feminists, but none of them could hold a can- dle, in Lawrence's eyes, to Frieda. This fearless conversa- tionalist, exuberant daughter of a civil engineer in Metz, was something else. She had an air of great openness and personal freedom, an omnivorous appe- tite for literature and for peo- ple, particularly if they hap- pened to be of the opposite gender. To Lawrence, trying to overcome his Midlands sexual hang-ups, she came as a Teu- tonic thunder-clap. Unbeknown to her 47-year-old husband, an expert on etymology, Frieda had already had several lovers while bearing his three children. An affair between Lawrence and Frieda soon' began in the wake of the lunch. Cautiously taking the posthumously published novel Mr Noon as a guide (where Gilbert and Johanna are their fictional counterparts) Worthen thinks it should \"make us reflect on the probability that they did go to bed together very soon indeed\". And, clearly, continued to do so. But they had to be careful - they would pursue their love-making on the maid's day off 'or away from Nottingham altogether. The ever-accommodating Garnetts provided a haven for them at the Cearne on one occasion. When, then, did the great elopement occur? The point is, it never did, According to one of her friends, Frieda told her that she had \"no intention whatsoever of leaving my husband and children and the comfortable and respectable life I knew to go off into certain social exile and most probable poverty.\" However, Frieda had to go to Germany for a family celebration; Lawrence was also going to Germany to see about the lektorship. While they were both there he hoped that \"we could have at least one week together\". In the event that week turned into a lifetime. Lawrence wrote to Weekley confessing that he and Frieda were passionately in love. Weekley replied to the effect that if Frieda stayed with Lawrence she would never see her children again. After that a terrible kind of emotionally-blackmailing postal chess game ensued, with the children as the pawns. Frieda longed and pleaded for a compromise, but Lawrence's will proved, in the bitter end, to be the stronger. As honeymooning fugitives the couple went on a long trek from Germany to Gargano on Lake Garda to begin their exile in Italy. Garnett met them there. He was on a tour with Harold Hobson - not the drama critic, ^ L '' lit~gi~, another one, though the whole thipg would make what the Suday Tmes man used to call \"a brulllyant play\". While Lawrence went bird-watching with Garnett, Frieda made love with Harold.Hobson. ..This is a superb biography. Apart from the compelling narrative there are judicious excursions into the mix of rurality and the mining industry that formed the background to Lawrence's. start in life. There are portraits of the family members and their circle of friends, and insights into Lawrence's admiring bluestockings and into the less well-known early works that led up to Sons and overas with which this book ends. Two more volumes will complete the Life. They are being written by different authors, Mark Kinkead-Weekes and David Ellis, for publication over the next four years. Cambridge have already given us at last a decent edition of Lawrence's fiction; now they are embarked on what should be the definitive life.",

   "text_content" : "T HE STEEL frame of the London Library is among its many won- ders. It is a monu- ment to the spirit of the great Victorians who conceived and built it, a Forth Bridge of the mind, proud, confident, endur- ing and invincible. The most vivid image, for me, in John Wells's light hearted but infor- mative history, Rude Words, is of Rose Macaulay after the air raid of 1944, swinging from the exposed girders like an acro- bat, rescuing books from the twisted wreckage. The engineers designed the gangways as grills so that day- light from the top windows could filter down; when lamps meant naked flames, this was a marvellous safety feature. The arrangement also produced another benefit, unforeseen when the Library was a male preserve - it gives members good opportunities for looking up the skirts of ladies, doing research on the floor above. The sections of the library built more recently have there- fore been fitted with floors of green opaque glass. The air of serene perma- nence which the library usu- ally exudes is an illusion. It has seldom been secure sinan- cially, and there have been innumerable delicious rows. Thomas Carlyle, the founder, had to exploit all his genius for indignation and irascibility to shame his friends into finding the money. He was determined that London, meaning himselt should have a library which would allow books to be taken home. He complained tirelessly at the the habit of writing com- ments in the margins of the books, while insisting on doing so himself. Carlyle's wife Jane shared many of his qualities, roaming round the Library complaining incessantly. It was a mercy, one of their friends remarked, that they had married one another, for that way they had made two people unhappy RUDE WORDS: A DISCURSIVE HISTORY OF THE LONDON LIBRARY by John Wells Macmillan Â£17.50, 240 pages instead of four. Gladstone, renowned for his success in saving candle ends at the Trea- sury, demanded to know the price of shelving. When told tenpence a foot, he asked if that included the top shelf which did not carry any books. In 1929, when a contented member bequeathed a whole country house to the Library for the benefit of the staff, the librarian sold it and swiped the money for general purposes; after the story came out he had to slink into his office each day by his private back door. The nearest the Library came to closure was in 1957 when Westminster City Coun- cil presented a huge bill for rates on the grounds that it provided recreation to its mem- bers as well as pursuing litera- ture. The day was only saved after T.S. Eliot wrote out a full manuscript copy of The Waste Land to be sold at auction. John Wells captures the atmosphere of the place with enthusiasm, erudition, and his own impish humour. One member, he relates, who asked for a book called Pacing eal- iy was told that it dealt with a subject not collected by the Library. But when Arthur Koestler was invited to cover the SpuasskylaFcbher match in Reykiavik and decided to mug up on Iceland and on chess, he found a book in the stacks called Chess in Iceland, pub. lishbed in 1905 by the Florentine Typegraphleal Society. The London Library, all members know really, is not only much loved, it is wonderfully effi- cdent Wfiam StClair",

   "text_content" : "P OSTHUMOUS compi- lations of a major writer's work can often be disappoint- ing, desultory affairs. Not so with this book, which brings together the uncollected non- fiction work of a leading Southern novelist of the post- Faulkner era. It is a testament to the cogency and immediacy of Walker Percy's thought that these essays, ranging over a thirty-year period, read as if composed for a single, sus- tained collection. Percy, who died last year at the age of 73, was a novelist who liked to think on the page. Ever since the publication of his remarkable first novel, The Moviegoer, in 1962, he proved himself to be a writer willing to tackle the big questions. Not that he was ever ponderous - it is hard to think of a writer who took on God, man and his- tory with more cutting irony and playful wit. Signposts in a Strange Land is a fitting coda to this author's work. Like fine Kentucky bourbon, it is smooth going down but power- ful in its effect. Editor Samway has divided the book into three parts, deal- ing with the South, writing and religion. The first of these sections is perhaps the liveli- est. Percy was born into a wealthy Memphis family and, after the tragic early deaths of his parents, was raised by his SIGNPOSTS IN A STRANGE LAND by Walker Percy, edited by Patrick Samway Bellew Â£14.95, 428 pages Uncle Will, a cultivated Missis- sippi gentleman whose home was a hub of artistic and intel- lectual activity. This upbring- ing left Percy with a deep nos- talgia for the manners, customs and spiritual life of the Old South. It is hardly an unblinkered affection, however - Percy repeatedly points out that the problem of slavery was the poi- soned chalice in which the mint juleps were served, keenp- ing it from achieving its poten- tial artistic or spiritual great- ness. Still, Percy loved the South, taking considerable ironic glee in how his region (now called the Sun Belt) came to provide the economic power to prop up the rusting North. And, if the race problem still exists in Mississippi, it is just as bad, if not worse, in New York - \"The South has gotten rich and the North has gotten Negroes, and the Negro is treated badly in both places. The Northerners won and freed the slaves and are now fleeing to the suburbs to get away from them.\". The book's second section provides a comprehensive statement of the aesthetic stance that informed Percy's novels. His books returned again and again to a single theme - that despite this cen- tury's technological advances, modern man is still gripped by a profound malaise, a feeling that for all our creature com- forts and indulgent morality, something is still missing. Modem science can explain everything except one small matter* \"what it means to be a man living in the world who must die.\" Percy saw his role as novelist as being similar to his original profession as a clinical pathologist. His books dissect the peculiar anomie that grips people who should be happy, om the strangely detached movie buff of his first novel to the neurotic, thought- ful heroes of Love in the Ruins and The Second Coming. Percy's answer to this mal- aise is hinted at in the book's third section; it is, unasham- edly, belief in salvation as offered by Jesus Christ and the Roman Catholic Church. What was always so striking about Percy was that, beneath the playful post-Modern veneer of his novels, lurked a Catholic Southern gentleman who had scant regard for the 20th cen- tury, including the Swaggerts and Falwells who sprang from the same \"Jesus haunted\" soil as he did. In an age when reli- gious language tends to be inflated, it is refreshing to read a believer/writer who refused to succumb to the temptations of cheap evangelism. Only in his apparent equation of abor- tion to Nazism does Percy seem to slip off the tightrope he walks between dogma and art. Walker Percy was that most attractive of artists - a Jere- miah who could laugh at both himself and his world, a deep believer who never saddled you with his faith. For readers of Southern literature and independent minded Christians alike, this is a book which should prove the sort of \"cumulative bliss\" Percy prom- ises on page 107 in his favour- ite mint julep recipe.

   "text_content" : "M E. The title cuts through all the nonsense, as Katharine Hep- burn the actress used to do. The braying voice, anvil cheek- bones, binding teeth; the long- skirted swagger. Hepburn was a maelstrom of self-assertion in an industry where actresses, at the start of her screen career in 1932, were supposed to be swooning violets or telegraphic temptresses. Before she arrived, no one could have imagined the cin- ema with her. Today no one could imagine it without her. As with all myths, the incon- ceivable became the indispens- able. Now the Hepburn appear- ance is immortalised on a bookjacket: a tough kookie with a tough smile, hair gilded and akimbo in the sun. And the Hepburn voice - part buzz-saw, part yap - can be heard'by the mind's ear all through Me: 400 pages of ver- bal carrying-on which make the reader conjure up an imagi- nary Spencer tracy, reacting in sweet stupefaction before the goddess of gab as he used to in their comedies together. She writes in the what- damn-thing-next mode and never-mind sentence struc- tures. Oh goodness she has been talent-spotted by So-and-So. Off to Hollywood. Well now. So much money. And acting with Barrymore. Then the box-office poison period. Now for Heaven's sake. Can you understand it? Nor me. Loved L.B. Mayer, though. Had a grand time with Howard Hughes too. Yes, there was gossip. Never bothered me. Then there was that car trip to Italy with Willie Rose the screenwriter to buy his Maser- ati. I think I'll write that as a playlet. Me: Where are we going, Willie? Willie: To Italy. Me: Why? Willie: To buy a Mas- erati. And so on. Oh I almost forgot my par- ents. Here they are. Dad on the left. Mum on the right. Now you want me to tell you about Spencer? Well, you'll have to wait. I did. 33 years. If any other film star had presented this stuff to us, we would have lobbed it into the nearest dumpster. It would have seemed cuteness mas- querading as style. With Hep- burn we know it reflects her rhythms of thinking because it reflects her rhythms of acting. In films like Alice Adams, The Philadelphia Story and Adam's Rib Hepburn howitzered the conventions of female stardom. Dialogue sounded not like demure cooing but like verbal shrapneL In any given scene she was out beyond the front- Katharine Hepburn: writes in the what-damn-thing-next mode *itt ; ME by Katharine Hepburn Viking Â£16.99, 418 paes line, blowing up all challenges, before her co-stars had even peeped above the trenches. Only artful slowness (Spencer Tracy's) or let's-pretend idiocy (Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby) could outwit her frantic, conquering energy. As she aged, Hepburn became a wiser actress and, if possible, a more beautiful one. Years of undimmed, and undammed, vivacity were dis- ciplined into the hydroelectric wattage of Long Day's Journey Into Night or The Lion In Win- ter. And even in nonsense like Rooster Cogburn or On Golden Pond she was less a Hollywood pensioner entering the guest- role phase than a power-station on permanent standby. Hepburn, above all, was a feminist before feminism. She never carried a banner for female emancipation, but she never needed to. She was in command of her life on screen and off, as she heedlessly chronicles here. Hounded from Hollywood in the 1930s by her \"box-ofcep poison\" reputation, she promptly triumphed on Broadway in The Philadelphia Story. She bought the movie rights, dictated the cast and director, made the film, won an Oscar nomination and never looked back. That this Boadi- cea strength could exist within the same actress who played shy spinsters in Summertime and The African Queen is one of the imponderable marvels of life and art. This is no longer a review, of course, but a fan letter. But then Katharine Hepburn is not just Katharine Hepburn. She is a cornerstone of popular cin- ema and a reason people love movies. We forgive her her title's Me because she was never just \"Me\" even to her- self. Egocentricity in the tal- entless is an embarrassment. In the talented it is a pardon- able grace-note in a symphony of achievement. You will just as easily find adagios of wise melancholy or scherzos of win- ning self-mockery. More than anything in this book I loved the story of Hep- burn's eye operation in Scot- land. It is a tale of old age and medical terror. It is told like a farce and ends with the hero- ine weeping blood. But it encompasses, in one seemingly inconsequential yarn, all the frailty of human fame and the human frame. Nigel Andrews",

   "text_content" : "Nigel Andrews takes in the Venice Film Festival A tale of two fellows: Kearn Reeves and River Phoeix in \"My Own Private Idaho\" O UTSIDE THE Palazzo Del Cin- ema a black box with a giant blue eye painted on it stares down from a grey brick pedes- tal. This is the 1991 Venice Film Festi- val logo and it is everywhere. On the poster, on the catalogue jacket, in your dreams. In addition Venice's proud new auditorium the Palagalilel, a roofed- over conversion of the old open-air Arena, is sponsored by an eye-glasses company. Eccolat We get the message. The art of cinema is for those who see, by those who see, about those who see. This should be blindingly obvious, .but 95 years of cinema history have clouded our perception. Most narrative films today are so underwrought visu- ally that you could doze through them with portcullised eyes so long as your ears stayed open for the dialogue. Nine- ty-to-120-minute stories with few imag- istic grace-notes. No wonder Venice '91 comes as a shock. First out of the gate: Anima Mundi, 30 minutes of whiz-bang footage of nature and the elements, mystically montage'd by the firm of Godfrey Reg- gio and Philip Glass (Koyaanisqatsi). Second film: Luc Besson's non-fictional Atlantis, a swirling hymn to the sea depths from the director of The Big Blue. Third and fourth films, at least as scheduled: two 50-minute autobiograph- ical essays from John Boorman and Nagisa Oshima. But Boorman's film failed to arrive, and we were left with the gorgeous images but vapid content of the Japanese film-maker's memories of Mum, Kyoto and all those cherry trees. Still, the thought counted. And the question \"What is cinema?\" promises to resonate. Positing an avant-garde, hi-fi- video future with Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books, one of two upcoming British competition entries, with Jar- Ean's Edward II, Venice balances its philosophical inquiry into Moviedom with a Hollywood retrospective (1929-33) that spotlights what the past used to tell us about filmgoing habits and expectations. This show is devoted to the censor- ship-prone Hays Code era when sex, violence and company had to sneak in under plain, or rather polymorphous, cover. Venice's golden-oldie triple bills - ten minutes each of Hearst Movie- tone News and cartoons, followed by a feature like Mamoulian's Applause or Borzage's Liliom - showcase the vari- ety moviegoers used to experience at the cinema before TV came and all film fare froze into feature format. Hollywood today, though, is showing signs of restless invention. Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, an early tip for the Golden Lion, has a plot so elusive you sometimes give up chasing it to imbibe the capricious visuals. Two young male prostitutes, River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, wrestle with family pasts and troubled presents. Phoenix is a narcoleptic looking for his lost mother. Reeves is a modern-day Prince Hal forced to choose between his surro- gate Dad, a crimeworld Falstaff, and his real one, who is the Mayor of Portland, Oregon. But not since Tuin Peaks has a two- sentence-story summary been so inade- quate. Filmed with wildly bizarre touches - porno-magazine covers that come to life, fish-eye close-ups, dreams that dovetail with the real - the film has an eclectic, free-form complexity worthy of James Joyce. In the Reeves plot the Shakespeare listings are shame- less. In the Phoenix plot the James Dean listings are shameless. But plagia- rism is part of post-modernism. What matters is the creative temperature at which the bric-a-brac is melted and fused together. My Own Private Idaho is sui generis and at heart dazzlingly simple: a tale of two fellows looking for their origins and identity, just like cin- ema itself in the run-up to its cente- nary. Nothing else has touched this film at the Venice festival so far. But one thing has touched.the Venice festival, and that is the death of Frank Capra. Imag- ine 200 Italian journalists responding to the loss of a Hollywood director who was born in, yes, Italy (Bisacquino near Palermo). As a Capra retrospective here some years ago proved, Italians go ber- serk for the blend of homely sentiment and plain-man socialism that marked films like Meet John Doe, Mr Deeds Goes To Town and Mr Smith Goes To Washington. One national newspaper headlined its obituary, with a tasteless. ness transcended by sheer sentimental intensity, \"Mr Capra Va In Paradiso.\" May I, having few things more to say about a yet modest film festival, put in my Frank Capra two-pennyworth? As a child I delighted in his amiable-tosh products: Lost Horizon, It's A Wonderful Lrfe. As a grown-up I loved and still love his wishful fairytales about Ameri- can decency winning out over Ameri- can corruption. Never mind that James Stewart could never get to Washington and overturn 100 years of vested-interest graft and duplicity. (Actually history in a playful moment gave us a Jimmy Stewart look- and-sound-like in Jimmy Carter. But he had no filibustering flair and no Jean Arthur.) And never mind that Gary Cooper could never clean up small-town civic corruption Mr Deeds-style as he later cleaned up small-town frontier thuggery in High Noon. The point is that Capra, from his architect's drawing board in the offices of American Dream Inc, gave Western idealists everything they could muse on and aspire to without the tedium of being practical. As Utopias go, Capra's were both sweet-and-silly and genuinely inspirational. Praise to him and his too seldom applauded screenwriter Robert Riskin. Praise too to the Stewarts, Coo- pers and Jean Arthurs who had the style to make New Deal comedy fizz like Old Deal screwball. Here in Venice we wistfully await a headline epiphany worthy of Capra: \"Mr Genius Comes To The Lido\" or \"It Happened One Night\". It still may hap- pen. Yet to come are new works from Godard, Herzog, Skolimowski, Szabo and Terry Gilliam. Meanwhile the sun shines, the gondolas bob, the wine spar- kles. Under the right conditions it is, as Capra claimed, a wonderful life.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Fairman on the latest Mozart offering HE TITLE of this fes tival tells all. This is very much \"Mozart - Now\", as he is played 'by the innovators in musical thinking in the 1990s, and not at all \"Mozart Then\" according to the performance style that obtained through the best part of the century. All the participants in the South Bank's main offering for the Mozart bicentenary year are period instrument specialists. This is the single feature which they have in common, as otherwise they are as diverse a selection of people and musicians as you are likely to find: Norrington the adventurer, Gardiner the immaculate professional and, in a group of four concerts which conclude tonight and tomorrow, Frans Braggen. He is the romantic of the group. Instead of uprooting the style of performing Mozart in an abrupt and violent break with the past, as some of his colleagues have done, Brulggen is an expressive musician who has absorbed the best of the old style; he continues to draw strength and nourishment from the roots of tradition. On the podium he looks a lanky figure, all arms and legs, and it is the very elbow-room that he brings to the music which makes his performances breathe so naturally. Even in the opening movement of the \"Haffner\" Symphony, No 35, which most \"authentic\" conductors drive along at a relentless rate, Brfiggen found time for the colours and lyrical phrases to flourish. The impression is of music being made spontaneously as it goes along, although that does have its obverse side. In any Bruggen performance there are always one or two features that do not come off: the throwaway ending to the Symphony No 39, for example, really did not work. The programme on Thursday was based on a concert that Mozart gave in Leipzig in 1789. They liked long evenings of music in those days and this one lasted nearly three hours despite omitting at least one concerto. Given the duration, the Orchestra of the 18th Century stayed the course supremely well, with fine solo wind playing both in the two symphonies and in a pair of soprano concert arias, successfully essayed by the mezzo Diana Montague. It was, however, with the Piano Concerto in C, K.508, that Brkggen came up against a collaborator of comparable sympathies in the pianist, Robert Levin. The programme-note promised us the concerto with trumpets and timpani, but in the event we had neither, which would seem to have been a conscious decision. There was little place for pomp in the way that conductor and soloist saw the music and this performance excelled in its feeling of intimacy, of easy give-and-take. There was a problem with audibility, though. The fortepiano is a delicate instrument and it should have been placed right at the front. Which leaves one novelty: in Mozart's day a soloist would often be expected to improvise if he was to prove himself the complete musician and this is what Levin did, composing as he went along a lsly-form ed Fantasia which might have been more impressive if the four ideas picked at random from an audience suggestion box had been less trite. Next time I threaten to submit the theme for a fugal finale.",

   "text_content" : "RITAIN HAS now seen La Gran Scena, the American travesty opera company, several times, as it has the annual farewell redt- als of its prima, Vera Galupe- Borszkh. I have also seen the company in New York. In short, I catch it as often as I can, yet it always surprises me to find that I laugh as much or more each time. It isn't always loud laughter. Sometimes it is a happy purr, and sometimes it is laughter that melts into amazement at the sheer finesse of the onmn. These dames have such rel ish for the sheer absurdity of opera. I love the fact that they're so dumb - except for that canny termagant, the 105- year-old Gabriella Tonnoziti -Casseruola. All the others =re really stoopid divas, hilari- ously unspontaneous in all their stage business; shrewdly scheming in all their transpar- ent, petty rivalries; Joyously devoted to their great calling. Several of the scenes they are showing on their current tour were new to Britain. Oi these, best is the large chunks of Catlleria Rusiaamr. When Santuzza (Vera Galuppe- Dorsakh) removes her cape, the audience guffaws at once to see that she's nine months preg- nant; and then cackles more because her chemise is made of the same material as Mamma Lucia's tablecloth. Funnier yet is when Santuua notices they're made of the samne stuff. Yet you've hardly time to laugh now; she knows her time is near. And, yes, she gets her first contractions during her anguished duet with Turiddu. This kind of sublime absur- dity is why some of us are Gran Scena devotees; and we know it is very near why we are opera devotees too. The company's two oldest divas are always on this level. I was thrilled to see and hear gain the aged Gabriella, per and yet nnoonsense, asbrupt in tak over as if she were Schro -and this her own masterolass. No-one has ever been more Italian than Gabriella; or more old. Above all, there is the even- ing's commire, America's most beloved retired diva, Sylvia Bills. \"I won't sing; don't ask me,\" she says again and again with increasing coyness, \"Not if you should stamp your feet and cry 'Sylvia! Sylvial Syl- via!'\" Whereas Gabriella is very much thr real operatic thing, Sylvia somehow shows you (she doesn't know it her- self) that she was never a great artist; and that is the most touching Gran Scena Joke cf all. But she too wants us to prate opera all we can; so Be translates every word, right down to \"Caro nome\" an. (abriella's surname. Her very earnestness becomes exquisite.

   "text_content" : "B RIAN McMaster is playing himself In qui- etly and dplpmaticallly as the new director of the Edinburgh Festival This is a shrewd move. His predeces- sor Frank Dunlop did not get far by having rows with the local council over its meanness with funding and its reluctance to give the city the opera house that the world's leading festi- val so obviously needs. At this year's festival the rows became an entertainment in their own right, generating better drama than rank was able to attract. His shortage of money meant that Edinburgh seemed to be playing perpetual host to eastern European art- ists just because they come cheap and expect little in the way of bed and board. After the financial success of 1990 this year's festival seems set to register a loss. A soft spot for eastern Euro- pean artists is a characteristic that McMaster shares with Dunlop, and during his time running the Welsh National Opera there was usually a pro- duction in the repertory directed by an East German. This apart, the festival seems set for a profound sea change, shaking off the patchwork image that was obvious in Frank Dunlop's last years. It seems inevitable that the festival will be slimmed, with fewer but grander events. The aim will be to make it a must for the cultural groupie, with opening nights that command international attention. The exorbitant cost of mounting big new opera productions could be shared with Salzburg or even Glyndebourne. Serious thought is being given to switching some of the specialist festivals that congre- gate around the main arts shindig - the book festival, the film festival, the television festival - to other times of the year. There is no attempt made to integrate their activities and sell them as a package, so the over-kill becomes quite count- er-productive. To stifle complaints that the Scottish contribution to the festival gets overlooked McMaster is contemplating an exclusively Scottish festival in Edinburgh, perhaps in the spring, offering a showcase of local artistic talent with the aim of attracting a world audi- ence. Undoubtedly the festival will take on a different feel - not just a switch in the bias from drama and towards music (ironically, for a theatre man, in Dunlop's last festival the music and opera were far bet- ter than the drama or dance), but more attention will be paid to the visual arts which have lost out in recent years. What seems oblivious to change is the Fringe, although the disil- lusion which grips many of the Fringe participants at Edin- burgh - the high cost of being there set against the total dis- regard of the media and the public - should continue the thinning of the Fringe which Is already underway. Mu. Networking is the nub word. When John cannot get through to George because he is taking a call from Mikhail that is net- working. Finance Ministers are in almost perpetual network, enjoying face-to-face sessions in attractive locations. The idea of a network of key figures running the world through personal contact developed out of the annual World Economic Forum at Davos. This is where the cards of the most influential politi- cians, economists and busi- nessmen change hands and the future cosily planned and pre dicted. Now the arts has its own network, built around two hun- dred artists, businessmen, patrons, and cultural gurus pledged to meet annually to ensure that the arts play a Antony Thorncroft on the changes needed in Edinburgh major role In the new world order. Klaus Schwab, who founded the Economic Forum, used his network contacts to call a gathering in Venice last week end. It was an invitation not easy to resist. Of course Dickie (Atten- borough), GiLnter (Grass), David (Hockney), and all, could not make it in the end, but Lorin (Maazel), Quincy (Jones) and Lord (Gowrie) were on hand, with a good gleaning of rich patrons, and a few hard faced men who reckon there is money in the arts. The fact that it was Regatta week end and, for jet setters, a choice of balls, probably encouraged acceptances. The host, Gianni de Michelis, Italian foreign sec- retary, who operates in perpet- ual overdrive, was generous to a fault. And did the Forum usher in a new Golden Age? Of course not. As ever at international conferences designed to break down barriers, national charac- teristics flourished, with the French glorifying the role of the \"artist\" as rebel, the Ger- mans hard-headedly asserting that culture never stopped a war, and the developing world bemoaning cultural exploita- tion. There were a few practical ideas, like a World Arts Vil- lage, to be held every four years, a super festival of Olym- pian proportions; like a cul- tural satellite, which would beam arts programmes to an estimated 500m subscribers; like the selection each year of a major monument for interna- tional salvation. None of these may material- ise, but there are cities pre- pared to play host to the 1992 Arts Forum and there are enough rich, energetic, men and women involved to make some kind of cultural mark. And always at such events one important idea surfaces: for example, that artists are a source of wealth, not a conse- quence of it, and that they are the innocent research and development workers for the $250bn global entertainment industry, which is growing by 15 per cent a year. This should warm the heart of the under- paid toiler in a touring drama group, or the artist patronised by a hard dealer. OEM The fine art salerooms may slumber through a long sum- mer, but that does not stop the rumour-mongers. The peren- nial story has surfaced again that Phillips is preparing a bid for Christie's. It is wonder- ful cheek. There is Christie's, an international company with sales last season of Â£650m, and there is Phillips, which has never made its mark outside the UK, where it operates an extensive chain of provincial auction houses which contrib- ute towards a turnover of Â£88m. But the chairman of Phillips, Christopher Weston, is a clever operator. He has built up small stakes in Christie's in the past and later sold them well. Now that ADT is vigorously trying to dispose of its 24 per cent holding in Christie's it is natu- ral that Weston should put down a marker, especially as Christie's half-year results, out soon, are likely to show a small profit but one not large enough to sustain the high share price. Even so, Weston knows that gathering together merchant banks to back him in a bid for Christie's, which would cost around Â£320m, is not on the cards unless the directors of Christie's agree. The fall out among Christie's specialists from a contested bid would be ruinous. The long running stand off is likely to continue - Weston would love Christie's to seek a merger, incorporating Chris- tie's expertise in big money Impressionists and its interna- tional contacts with Phillips' homely concentration on the medium end of the market, but in the immediate future noth- ing could be further from Christie's intentions. Ideally it hopes that ADT can sell its stake to as many small share- holders as possible; practically it is seeking one large friendly holder of the shares, perhaps a well-respected conglomerate which could buy the whole company and release it from the nagging saga of its owner- ship.",

Conference cen- tres and mental institutions, no doubt, and small liberal-arts colleges: Bard College is one of the latter, with 600 gracious acres reaching to the Hudson. It also has a President, Leon Botstein, who is a distin- guished 19th century musicolo- gist, and the conductor-elect (from next summer) of Sto- kowski's old American Sym- phony Orchestra, and a formi- dable go-getter. Last year he inaugurated an annual Bard Festival, \"Redis- coveries\", with the object of making audiences listen to all- too-familiar composers with fresh ears - last summer Brahms, this year Mendels- sohn. What is there to be learned, you might ask, about Felix Mendelssohn? Nobody denies the genius of his preco- cious Octet for strings and the Midsummer Night's Dream music, nor of the later Violin Concerto and his irresistible \"Italian\" Symphony - and there are some brilliant piano encores too. On the other hand, to most modern ears Elfh and the \"Reformation\" Smp sound like bland to Victorian taste.

The programmes, arranged by Bot- stein and his colleague Sarah Rothenberg, succeeded beyond expectation in doing just that. The \"marginal\" events had an important role, and I will write about them later; but Bot- stein's three orchestral con- certs for the second weekend had to be the proof-of-the-pud- ding, and they made a revela- tory impression. These fist set Mendelssohn in is period-context - the \"Scot- tish\" Symphony (to which I've always been immune) with Niels Gade's op. 1 \"Echoes of Ossian\", William Sterndale Bennett's The Natids, Spohr's Faust Overture and Weber's evergreen Konurtstck. The last was a disappointment: Gil- bert Kalish, an estimable pia- nist, had apparently accepted the engagement but forgotten to learn the piece, which in better hands could have illus- trated a vein that Mendelssohn was too straitlaced to explore. The rest of the also-rans was far better - lucid, period- steady (a Botatein trademark), pristinely charming in naive orchestral colours. Tbose pieces set up wonder- hilly the superior skil of Men delsioh's \"Scottish\". Despite its misleading no. 3\" it was his last symphony, and Bot- stein ezplord it with rare Ba.

It is too gentle to make a self-standing score - it was designed as sober enhance- ment to the spoken drama, which at Bard was compressed into Claire Bloom's rivetting one-woman narration. The last concert packed the most thoughtful punch. A main Botstein theme had been Mendelssohn as Christianised Jew. Felix's grandfather was the revered liberal philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and his prudent, well-assimilated ftther had had him bptised early; yet the composer clove (discreetly) to his Jewish iden- tity. Botatein detected that loy- alty in Mendelssohn's Goethe- cantata Die erste WalpW is- mKht, about pagans and Dru- ids who fend off a bloodthirsty Christian attack by painless cunning, and he placed it before the *Lobgesang\" ym- phony-cantta - Impecably Christian stff, performed at Bard with mpeccable fervour. uly proptd we heard those ~Wu as haunted by unspoken echo, and the music gained imnmesurabl.

   "text_content" : "Antony Thorncroft on how Cotswolds dealers are faring WO OR three years ago it was a popu- lar dream. Sell your London property at a vast profit; or take early retirement from your merchant bank; or dis- pose of your company in the boom; and move to the Cots- wolds and start afresh in the antique business. If you were a London antique dealer, plagued with rising rents and business rates, there was even more incentive to join the 100 and more trad- ers who make the Cotswolds a viable, and much more agree- able, alternative to the capital. The advantages are still there - the beautiful country- side, the relaxed lifestyle, the support of fellow dealers who tend to co-operate as much as they compete. The only disad- vantage is the lack of custom- ers. Stow and Moreton-in- Marsh, Broadway and Burford may look crowded on a warm summer afternoon but few of the holidaymakers are buyers of antiques. The retailers need the Amer- ican dealers and the continen- tal collectors. Above all they need the rich locals who have traditionally furnished their elegant homes from the village antique shops. All are thin on the ground, in particular the British. Trade is definitely sluggish, but so far there have been no big closures. Kenulf, the only Cotswold dealer to cease trading, came unstuck over property rather than paintings. It is really a question of con- fidence. Undoubtedly there has been some impoverishment. Money has been lost at Lloyd's; company profits are down; the sharp decline in house prices has curtailed the pleasures of moving and furnishing a new home. But basically traditional antique collectors have pulled in their horns; they feel guilty about spending money. It is worst perhaps for the picture dealers. The antique furniture boys.have done bet- ter because customers can jus- tify to their conscience buying something as utilitarian as a Georgian table or a set of Vic- torian chairs. A picture is seen as an extravagance in an aus- tere era. But in spite of the gloom there are reasons for the Cotswold dealers to keep up their confidence. They are probably not doing as badly as most of the London. trade. Their overheads can be up to 50 per cent lower and their business is built around regular customers. Although the Cotswolds attracts trippers by the hundred thousand they rarely spend more than Â£100 on a holiday memento. Well-estab- lished dealers have a network of local and foreign buyers - around half are dealers them- selves - who they know will still be interested in a particu- lar picture, or a Chelsea figure, or an oak chest, or a 17th cen- tury long case clock. The ques- tion now is whether they dare buy that treasure. Oddly, the other problem for dealers is a shortage of high- quality antiques. The sale- rooms have become the main source of stock for dealers and the , salerooms are turning away low price, routine mate- rial and asking potential sell- ers to put low reserves on even quality antiques. Unless there This blue-John tea chest has a macassar ebony lid with ormolu decoration. It will be shown by Witney Antiques jlÂ· 1 : :C- is an urgent need to sell most owners are staying aloof from the market and waiting for prices to improve before they dispose of their goods. When a good picture, or a fine piece of furniture, does appear dealers compete quite keenly. So prices have not fallen as much as buyers expect, although dealers will probably be more prepared to accept an offer. Some dealers have found that potential sell- ers, deterred by the cool recep- tion they are receiving in the auction houses, are offering them high-quality goods at attractive prices. Of course there is nothing more tedious than sitting in a shop waiting for custom, so Cotswolds dealers are out and about working harder. For pic- ture dealer John Noott of Broadway this means doing the big fairs, such as the recent gathering at the National Exhi- bition Centre, the largest of its kind in the country. There was no fall in the number of visi- tors and most dealers did enough business to go home reasonably happy. Noott reck- ons this is the worst recession he has known but his 20 years of trading have enabled him to build a regular clientele which tides him over. For Rick James, of the Pri- ory Gallery at Bishops Cleeve, it means yet more trips abroad buying continental pictures by artists such as the late 19th century portraitist of pretty women, Toussaint, which are still in demand by affluent con- tinental dealers and collectors. He has seen an improvement in the past quarter and is now cfi Crca buying again. For Brian MacDonald of the Sanarkland Galleries it means constant travel linked to lec- tures in which he instructs potential clients in the attrac- tions of oriental carpets, in particular nomadic rugs. He is the first dealer in this special- ist sector to set up in the Cots- wolds and is happy with the move. Collectors enjoy a trip into the country and his costs are much lower than in London. Business may not be as brisk as he would have hoped but Persian carpets and rugs will always be a sector in which buyers need advice and he finds he can service his world- wide clients from Stow. Manfred Schotten is another specialist dealer, in his case golf and tennis memorabilia, who finds few disadvantages in being based in Burford. Like other Cotswold dealers he has detected an improvement in demand in the last two months and feels that his small, but keen, network of international collectors will always be in contact to see if he has added to his stock: The Japanese have temporarily deserted this field and prices at the golf memorabilia auctions in the summer were lower than in 1990: so anyone wanting a 19th century golf club or tennis racket can expect a bargain. The Fosse Gallery has also found buyers prepared to buy if the price is right. It recently held a successful exhibition of Scottish art, with an average price of Â£4,000 a painting, and in September is offering 20th century British pictures rang- ing from the Bloomsbury School onwards. Around two thirds of its customers are from London and the Home Counties. Undoubtedly the Cotswold dealers are having to work harder to stay in profit. Unlike their London rivals they tend to run their businesses on a tighter rein and are reluctant to build up excessive bank overdrafts. For many it is an agreeable way of life rather than a way of making a for- tune. But to succeed in 1991 you have to try new initiatives. Witney Antiques, for exam- ple, is putting together in the autumn its best exhibition built around antiques associ- ated with tea drinking - cad- dies, services, pots, etc. Other specialist dealers, such as Brand Inglis, with silver, Jona- thon Home in ceramics, and Ray O'Shay in prints, are co- operating, and there will be a comprehensive catalogue. It is the kind of show usually located in London, and is an indication of Cotswold determi- nation to ignore the recession.",

   "text_content" : "a name which tumbles from the UM when chat turns to art galleries. ay \"Glasgow\" and the reflex response could be Barrel Say \"London\" and it could be Tate, National, Hayward or a number of others. Say Walusall and the response is not likely to be Garman-Ryan. It is more likely to be - where? what? In fact, the Garman-Ryan Collection Is rich, eclectic, personal. Critics admire it, but the public knows little of it. \"Even in the Midlands, a lot of people don't know it is here,\" confesses Peter Jenkinson. director of the museum and art gallery in Walsall. There is a case for arguing that Garman-yan is the most striking and interesting personal collection put together in Britain this century. Nearly 400 works were drawn together between 1959 and 1978 by Kathleen Garman, the late Lady Epstein, and by Sally Ryan, an American sculptress and painter who was a descendant of Thomas Fortune Ryan, an entrepreneur from the robber baron era and one of those against whom US anti-trust legislation was originally directed. Garman was brought up in the Black Country, which is why she bequeathed the collection to the museum and art gallery in Walsall, a west Midlands town to the north of Birmingham. It was a massive addition to the cultural resources of the region in particular and the nation in general. For Walsall, the collection is an embarrassment of riches. \"It was left to us on condition everything is on display at one time,\" notes Jenkinson. That condition has not been met. Upstairs in the present Edwardian gallery, compressed into one high ceilinged, barrel-vaulted room with inadequate lighting and technologically poor ventilation, the intimacy of the works, for the most part small in size, is dissipated by crowding. The collection's centreplece is a series of 43 works by Sir Jacob Epstein, runing from early drawings to the maquettes for his sculpture commissions. But the collection broadens from that into works by Epstein's friends - Modigliani and Augustus John, for example - and into works by those connected with the family, like Lucian Freud. But Garman and Ryan were canny buyers and they extended the collection with the works of French artists such as Cezanne, Degas, Gaugin, Manet, Monet, Matisse and Pissarro. To turn the embarrassment of riches into a celebration, the Walsall borough council would like to builda new museum. It has spent 2S6M000 on preliminary worL Planus have been drawn up by Levitt Bernstein Associates for a callery which would space out Ganma-Ryan through a series of interlocking rooms, permitting the works to be hn In the space they deserve and nthe environmental surroundings they demand, and also ensuring easy access. The dificulty Is that the council has run out of money and cannot find the LÂ£2.Sm to Â£2.7m necessary from its own resources to build the gallery. U it is built, it will be one of the few galleries to be constructed in the UK during the 1990s, but, as Jenkinson sighed, \"everybody is fund-raising at the moment.\" No planning has been involved, but Garnan-Ryan effectively complements other collections In the Birmingham and Black Country conurbation. The biggest Paul Cheeseright on an art collection that deserves better collection is in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where the paintings are displayed according to different schools and different periods with a particularly fine gallery of Pre-Raphaelites and water-colourists. Elsewhere In the conurbation, the Wolverhampton Art Gallery and Museum, with an annual budget of Â£10,000 for acquisitions, concentrates on contemporary art. But, outside the municipal ambit, there is the Barber Institute of Flne Arts at Birmingham University. There, over the last 50 years, a collection of jaintings, running from Bellini to Magritte, to represent rather than cover the major schools of European art, has been cautiously assembled with an emphasis on quality.

   "text_content" : "Susan Moore reports on the verve and vision of the grandest Italian antiques fair HE MASSIVE bulk of the Palazzo Strozzi, the largest of the 15th century Florentine palaces, makes an appropriately impos- ing venue for the oldest and grandest of the Italian antique fairs. Its boldly rusticaled facade towers above the piazza, its pietra forte walls embrace well over an acre. \"Imagine demolishing the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence,\" said Aldous Huxley, \"it would be about as easy to demolish the Matterhorn.\" This month sees the 17th biennial Mostra Mercato Inter- nazionale dell'Antiquariato, from September 21 to October 9. Here the organisers revel in making a virtue out of a neces- sity. The palace, with its rela- tively small, almost cell-like Renaissance rooms, is trans- formed into a sort of Western- style souk of opulent booths. Its metamorphosis is achieved with a verve and visual inven- tion unimaginable north of the Alps. The fair marks the end of the summer break and the launch of the season as Italians return to the cities after the lakes and the coast. Arguably it is the best time to be in Florence. The international community of dealers certainly thinks so. This year's event represents more than 60 Italian exhibitors, Antonacci and Bellini among them, plus a handful of British and German dealers, including Agnew's, Colnaghi, Harari & Johns, and Lingenauber, Neuse and Heide Hfibner. Sculpture dealer Bruno Scardeone comes from Lugano, De Jonkheere from Paris. Kekko brings Old Master drawings from Toronto, Richard Feigen Old Master paintings from New York. A first is the group of 11 top Spanish dealers showing under the auspices of the Asociacion de Profesionales en Arte Antiguo y Moderno. The asso- ciation took a bow earlier this year at the Rome fair in May, and its presence suggests an increasing interest in the two-way traffic of works of art between Spain and Italy. The increased international- ism of the participants reflects the efforts of the organisers to revitalise and modernise the fair after a period of stagna- tion. This year, too, the exhib- Repatriated: Benvenuto dl Glovanna's \"AssumpUon of the Virgin, of 14M0. Ito most Important plut at O fhair its will be vetted by two com- mittees made up of representa- tives of the Soprintendenza ai Beni Artistici e Storici, of museums, and academics. One is to guarantee provenance, the other authenticity. For the Italian trade, the advantage of foteign participa- tion is that the fair will have the attraction of offering some- thing new to the home market, in contrast to the large number of small fairs in Italy which seem simply to demonstrate the movement of goods within the country. For the foreign dealers in Italian works of art, the vast amount of which is bought by Italians, the fair provides an excellent showcase. London dealer Derek Johns, exhibiting for the first time, explains: \"We are going in search of the strong Italian market. In the past four months all I have been selling are Italian pic- tures to Italians.\" And, as Daml seldorf dealer Eckard Lingen- auber put it: \"The fair is the only way to import pictures into Italy without complications.\" London dealers Agnew's and Colnaghi both reported good fairs In 1989, as did Stefan Kekko of the Gallery Kekko, exhibitors of 25 years' stand- ing. According to Herr Lingen- auber, another Palazzo Strozi veteran; however, fair business has changed. \"If a guy goes to a fair these days thinking he is going to do business, he is dreaming.\" His business now depends on \"finding the right thing, researching it thor- ougzy, and then presenting it to old, established clients.\" Why, then, does he participate in the Biennale? \"To show my face, and have fun.\" New exhibitor Richard Sei- gen has adopted a similar atti- tude from the outset. \"We have decided to drop all fairs, except perhaps the Art Show in New York. We don't have things that are decorative, and I don't have the desire to specialise in still lifes and vedute. Perhaps 80 per cent of our business is with museums. I don't have a commercial objective for going to the Palazzo Strozzi fair, I am trying to make a statement rather than sell things. I hope we meet some collectors, but if we don't, well, I love Florence and, as you can imagine, none of my staff mind being there either.\" Over the last few years the quality of the paintings on show at Palazzo Strozzi has increased noticeably. It seems that this year fine art - rather than works of art - may steal the show. Felgen, for instance, is repatriating what he believes will be the most Important picture at the fair, Benvenuto di Giovanni's 9ft high Assumption of the Vyrgk 1498. The US banker J. Pier- pont Morgan had bought it in 1910 and bequeathed it to the Metropolitan Museum, which deaccessioned it in 1978. Impor- tant too is his Orazio Gentiles chi Vision of St Francis, and Ludovico Carracci's Alexander and Thafs. Agnew's is planning to take Tintoretto's Deposition of the late 1550s and, of local interest, three hitherto unrecorded gold ground panels by Marrioto di Nardo illustrating scenes from the Life of St Stephen for the altarpiece of the Florentine church of Santo Stefano irn Pane. Colnaghi is offering works from the 14th to the late i8th century, including part of a predella of Francia's earliest great altarpiece and, for the first time, a group of Italianate rather than Italian vedute. Lin genauber will bring a gold ground triptych by Andrea da Firenza, and a Guiseppe Maria Crespi, plus a handful of Northern pictures. Harari & Johns offer five 15th century gold grounds, including a Bernardo Daddi St Dominic. Its selection repre- sents all the centuries up to the 19th, en route two 18th cen- tury views of the Arno by Thomas Patch and William Marlow. The stand will also have Florentine Old Master drawings from Munich dealer Katrin Bellinger, and Renais- sance bronzes from the Lon- don-based Johannes Auer- sperg. Works of art throughout the fair range from sculpture and furniture to silver, ceram- ics, textiles and carpets, and oriental art - from 14th cen- tury celadon to GOib Ponti. A number of events, exhibi- tions and projects accompany the fair. A lecture programme, for example, ranges from the distinguished Mina Gregori on 18th century Florentine view painting, far less well known than its Venetian cousin, and the Principessa Glogiana Cor- sini on the problems of keeping an important historic collection. In 1989 there were small exhibitions of 15th and 16th century Russian icons from Moscow, and Deuta ceramics from Perugia. This year the USSR thread continues with 19th century watercolours from Leningrad by Russian art- ists working in Italy, and Lon- don-based dealer Trinity Fine Art shows drawings from the recently discovered Valadier archive, which represents the work of three generations of the leading family of 18th cen- tury Roman goldsmiths.

   "text_content" : "AST YEAR English cricket's Test team worked up its confidence with vic- tories over New Zealand .and India. Last winter it suffered crushing defeats on an unhappy tour of Australia. This sum- mer it enjoyed a drawn series against the West Indies, followed by victory over Sri Lanka. It was a good humoured, successful summer. The question now is whether England's confidence will develop and mature or die away under the pres- sures of modem Test cricket, starting with a tough series against Pakistan next summer. This winter's ICC World Cup in New Zealand and Australia exercises a different kind of pressure. It is a one-day substitute for a Test competi- tion to find the 'best team in the world. Test cricket has no such com- petition. It lacks the clear interna- tional aim it had in the days when matches between England and Aus- tralia dominated the world and were, in effect, world championship matches. In 1877 the first Test match in his- tory was played at Melbourne, against a combined Australian XL It is clear from the reports which The Times correspondent sent back to his paper that in the outback of the Empire as much as in its London headquarters, cricket was all that really mattered. \"As may be supposed, the game was watched with intense excitement by enthusiastic crowds, and those who could not get to the ground clustered round the newspaper offices to see the last despatches from the seat of war placarded on the door posts\". Those days are past. Today the great traditional duels, between England and Australia and England and the West Indies, stand out less because they are surrounded by series against other strong teams, such as Pakistan, who can more than hold their own against the heavyweights. This summer brought the old Anglo-Caribbean rivalry back to life, but while England were delighted to pull off a draw, Pakistan have drawn their last three series against the West Indies. They reckon they can make short work of England next summer and England will not start making their battle plans until they return from Australasia in March, with first-hand experience of what they are going to be up against. Most modern Test series are played with a sense of urgency rather than overall strategy, though the West Indies and Australia still do well with their policies of persistence, making as few team changes as possible. The World Cup is simple. It makes short, sharp demands of the teams playing and the teams make short, sharp changes as they play. Games are played in a highly strung atmo- sphere, saturated with publicity and advertising. There is a lot of money at stake. It is a cricket bonanza, good for the winner's morale but not to be taken to heart by the losers. Not only should England take the World Cup lightly; they should take the whole winter lightly, making the most of the fact that this is a period of change for several leading Test teams which are reaching the end of an era, losing their most influential players. New Zealand no longer have the invaluable services of Richard Hadlee. The West Indies bade a spectacular farewell this summer to their idol and inspiration, Viv Richards. Pakistan 'Modern Test series are played with a sense of urgency rather than strategy' need a new leader to succeed Imran Khan, who held the side together for much of the 1980s. Next summer a lot will depend on whether Imran decides to come out of retirement again for one more last stand, as he did last winter to lead Pakistan to safety against the West Indies. With a captain who is no longer young, English cricket qualifies as one of those Test sides \"working out a future direction for everyone involved in it\". (Cricket management's non-lan- guage, second to none). Graham Gooch is 38 and cannot have many more years to go in charge. He would be the last to put himself in the Had- lee, Imran or Richards category. His captaincy is often routine and unadventurous; at worit it is grim, as in his Trent Bridge use of Richard Illingworth to try and suffocate the game with unplayable leg-side bowl- ing. But the fact is that under his captaincy England have drawn a series against the West Indies for the first time since 1973-4, and at the Oval made the West Indies follow on for the first time since 1969. Gooch is a quiet, honest man, respected by his team, and the key to his recent success has been his bat- ting. He captains from the crease. England's victory at Headingley was the perfect tribute to Gooch's match- winning 154 not out in dour condi- tions which no-one else could handle. Gooch and Micky Stewart, the team manager work closely, if not always cleverly, together. With Stewart's term of office soon to come to an end, Keith Fletcher, a shrewd tactician and astute judge of the game, is the obvi- ous choice as his successor. He and Gooch are both Essex men and would work well together, not just in putting more imagination into England's approach, but also in sorting out who should take over when Gooch is no longer captain. It is a heavy problem for which I cannot pretend to have the answer. One of the summer's unhappiest sights was Mike Atherton, prema- turely ear-marked for the captaincy, having a dismal series, unfit and uncomfortable, playing poor, painful cricket. It may be that he will grow. into the job, but what he needs is the winter off. The popular choice as captain has always been Mike Gatting, who has blasted his way back into form late in the season. But he will be 36 when he is free of his South African quaran- tine, which has one more year to go. Kim Barnett, 31, also has one more year of his South African penalty to go. He would be a more enterprising choice. He enjoys plotting and man- oeuvring his way towards victory and is a fiercely attacking batsman and captain whose cricket does not always work, but is never dull. Derek Pringle and Alec Stewart may soon be included among the pos- sibles. The key is confidence. One of the most encouraging sights this sum- mer was the appearance of young players who looked not just capable but confident and determined. At 25, Phil Tufnell is a man matured by his humiliations in Aus- tralia, as he showed with flighty elo- quence in his brilliant spell at the Oval: 14.3 overs, 6 for 25, including a triple wicket maiden. Mark Ramprakash, a mere fledgling at 22, was more cautious than he would have liked to have been. He restrained himself doggedly, to avoid mistakes that would leave England in the batting crises in which he habitu- ally found them. His average for the series was 23, and he is in danger of smothering his talent. Only when England solve their batting problems and build a confi- dent attack around the central strength of Gooch and Robin Smith will young, stylish batsmen such as Ramprakash and, with luck, John Morris, have a chance to bat England to some full-blooded Test victories.

   "text_content" : "[ HE WONDERK of seeing a rugby team from the Soviet Union play in England for K the first time at Twickenham this afternoon is not that they can play rugby, because they play rugby quite well, thank you. On a recent tour of New Zealand, the Soviets won four of their eight matches. No, the wonder is they are here at all. A couple of weeks ago they had no sponsor, no flight and no kit. None of this seemed very impor- tant at a\\time when tanks were sur- rounding the Russian parliament in Moscow. But then the rugby season which gets underway today is far from being ordinary. It is the most momentous in the northern hemisphere since the breakaway that led to the founding of the rugby league. The reason is the frenzied competi- tion for the World Cup, which starts on October 3 when England meet New Zealand, the defending champions, at Twickenham. Sixteen countries will play 31 matches in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France in the fol- lowing 31 days. It is going to be a dizzy time trying to keep track of it all and, as most games will be televised - in the UK on the ITV network - it is advisable to get your aerial checked and your video recorder in working order now. This month, meanwhile, could be compared with the last moments before exams start. Preparations may or may not have gone well but they have at least gone. England's game against the Soviet Union, for example, comes after an eventful tour of Aus- tralia and Fiji. Ireland toured Namibia and Scotland have been to Romania. Australia and New Zealand competed for the Bledisloe cup. Much of the attention is focused on England and not just because the tro. hy is named after William Webb lis and the final will be at Twickenr ham. Only a brave man would predict an England victory with its ageing forwards. No one doubts the strike power of Rory Underwood and Jeremy Guscott or the leadership of Will Carling. Will England's forwards provide them with sufficient ball; indeed, will England's back row be mobile enough to cover the ground? Most of all, haven't too many of England's eight men and true passed their sell-by date? There is a joke circulating in Wales to the effect that when new coach Alan Davies asked the Welsh players to take up their normal positions, they all trotted behind the goal line. They have been having a hard time, with only three wins in their last 21 internationals. They lost again on Wednesday evening, their tenth successive defeat by France, this time by 22-9. Consider- ing that Wales had lost their previous international by a cool 57 points and lost their previous game to France by a mere 33 points, a margin of 13 points represents a substantial improvement. Some of Wales's pride was restored. There was a commit- ment that had been missing in previ- ous internationals, notably in the fan- tastic defeat by Australia in mid-summer. Perhaps the most committed Welsh- man of all is Davies. \"If we were all to die on October 10 and I had two last wishes, they would be that we beat Western Samoa and Argentina,\" he has said. \"Everything the players do from now until then has to be focused on that. Every time we get up in the morning we must ask ourselves: 'What can we do today that will help beat Samoa and Argentina? Life after the World Cup does not, cannot, exist.'\" Ireland toured Namibia and lost both matches. They face a combined club team this afternoon, an attempt, said one one wag, to make sure they win something before the start of the World Cup. Scotland, having lost to Romania in Bucharest a week ago, will play the Barbarians at Murrayfield. Scotland, master-minded by Ian McGeechan, the best rugby coach in Britain, have a real possibility of reaching the final and providing they keep winning their matches they will play at Mur- rayfield until the final. When all is said and done, though, the anticipated Australia and New Zealand semi-final in Ireland on Sun- day, October 27, could be the match that provides the winner. New Zea- land retained the Bledisloe Cup recently with a doughty performance in Auckland. Australia are the narrow favourites. For the moment, nothing else matters in rugby beyond the World Cup - not the divisional championships, the leagues or anything else. If that is a worrying prospect, then just think: there is still the international championship to come after Christmas.",

   "text_content" : "WHEN INTRODUCED eight years ago the Peugeot 205 became an instant success and it is still a best seller. Now comes the 106, which makes its debut at Frankfurt Show next week and promises to do for Peugeot in the 1990s what the 205 did in the 80s. The 106 looks a proper little Peugeot, with styling likely to be as time defying as the 205's has been. It is about 3 in inches (7 cm) shorter than the 205 but so roomy Inside that Peugeot claims it is more spa- cious than many of its class rivals. But which class? The biggest surprise about the 106 is that it is not reck- oned to be the. 205's baby brother, nor a rival to the Citr6en AX from the other branch of the PSA family. Peugeot calls it a Blass car. That makes it a direct competi- tor for the 20, which will stay in production for another year or two, as well as cars such as the Ford Fiesta, Fiat Uno and Renault Clio. The 106 goes on sale in France next week but British buyers will have to wait until later this year. They will, I understand, find t it tle if any cheaper than the 205 though specfications and prices have not been finalised. At its launch there are four 106 models - XN, XR, XT and XSi - with our equipment lev- els. All are doar bhatchbacks. The XN entry model has a 954 cc, 45 borsepower gine and the top performing XS a fal irnected 100 cc unit producing 100 horsepower. In between are 1124 cc (00 hp) and 1=0 cc (75 hp) versions. At present there are no die- sels in the line-up although their Introductio can canly be a mattr of tme. One in our 2s soaid Is a dital and PSA will not let its domiaance of this niche slip away. Fivedoor 10b wil follow quite quickly but there are no plans for either pow=w tido n nor automatic transmission. This will please Renault, whose Co can be had with both, and may disappoint mainly urban motorists for whom a nicely furnished 106 would otherwise be ideal. Peugeot people say the steering is so light that power assistance is unnecea. I will not know if they me ight until I get my first drive in a 106 In a few weeks time. Then I shall find out f Peugeot's other claims stand up. But, having sat in a couple of 106s, I can vouch hr thar remarkably roomy interiors.

   "text_content" : "\"OF COURSE you get worried when they start to change shape and run faster,\" says Frank Dick, the erudite British athletic team coach. \"But you cannot point the finger of sus- picion at every improving ath- lete.\" Drug-taking has produced an era of distrust in international athletics. Drugs which help athletes train longer and harder are acknowledged as widely available on a flourish- ing black market. Using drugs can save on training time and improve performance - irre- spective of the medical, ethical and career risks. Rumours abound, knives are regularly drawn and the whispering has been intense. Yet optimism appears to have broken out among some sports administrators. Sir Arthur Gold, chairman of the British Olympic Association, says: \"I do feel that we have turned the corner on drug abuse. When I first brought the subject of drugs to the Interna- tional Olympic Association's attention in 1968, I was laughed out of the room. They said: 'You'll never be able to stop it.' We have come a long way forward since then.\" For many, the watershed came when the Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson broke the tape and the world record in the 1988 Seoul Olympic 100 metres - and then tested posi- tive for steroids. \"That was the catalyst for governments, sports authori- ties, the media and the public to start taking the problem seriously,\" says professor Peter Radford of the Sports Council's drug abuse advisory group. \"From that moment money was made available and action was taken which has had a sig- nificant impact on drug abuse in Britain and abroad.\" All parties admit that the extent of the drug problem is unknown. The sports authori- ties and coaches usually deny widespread abuse but acknowl- edge individual excess, while the competitors who get caught tend to fling accusa- tions around. Sir Arthur concedes that drug abuse has been wide- spread in some areas of sport, but contends that the \"shame factor\" has risen significantly over the last 10 years, thanks largely to new and stricter test- ing procedures. The modern drug culture among athletes had its roots in the US in the late 1950s. In the 1970s, stimulants -were the drugs giving most cause for concern. Drugs like amphetamines were taken on the day of a competition to boost performance. However, competition testing, which came into widespread use in the late 1970s, sharply reduced their use. Since then steroids have made all the news. They are used. for muscle building and to increase strength and endurance. The rub for the authorities is that if an athlete stops taking steroids about 14 days before testing they are undetectable. \"Only the careless and the ill-advised get caught,\" says Sir Arthur. Charlie Francis, the trainer who fed Ben Johnson and a dozen other athletes steroids iur ~v~ui yn~n urn .m vy r of several yea e knew what was happening in East Germany. Their coaches told us. It was part of the systeinm, so we talked about it and exchanged information.\" Hans-Juergen Noczenski, former chief of the East German Judo Association, was quoted in the west German press as saying: \"Every athlete that competes internationally for East Germany is doped, every one.\" However, Sir Arthur describes the emphasis put on eastern bloc abuse by the US as \"the best PR smokescreen ever. The US is by far the worst offender,\" he says. The advent of out-of- competition testing could herald the end of steroid abuse on both sides of the Atlantic. The effect on British athletics since its introduction two years ago has been considerable. Sports Council officers are regularly testing athletes, and not just on their practice tracks and club grounds. Britain is pressing for similarly stringent measures to be applied in other countries. Agreement for mutual cross-testing has already been reached with Australia. and Canada, and other countries are likely to follow. While the net seems to be tightening on steroids, other products and techniques are challenging the system. For example, erythropoieten (EPO), a natural human hormone used in the treatment of anaemia, which boosts red blood cell production and the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, is easy to administer and is undetectable without a blood test. \"EPO is excessively dangerous and will kill,\" says professor Radford. \"I don't think we will ever make sport completely clean. But it's time we asked ourselves: 'What is sport? What kind of society do we want?\"' Dick agrees. \"The battles are being won but not the war. This will go on for a very long time. While we know what we're up against at the moment, what will they think to take next?\" Christopher Price",

   "text_content" : "Arthur Hellyer hopes to see new demand for an old favourite D URING THE first 50 years of this century, penstemons were among the most pop- ular of summer-flowering plants. They were widely used for summer display and the large-flowered varieties were also popular for exhibition. During August and September, cuttings were taken and rooted in frames and were either over- wintered in them or, when well-rooted, were moved into other frames in which they could be given more room and allowed to grow on slowly until the spring, when it was safe to replant them outdoors. All these penstemons were on the border-line of hardiness, some just hardy, except in exceptionally cold years or dif- ficult places, some sufficently tender not to be trustworthy without protection, except when the weather was mild or the situation favourable. These penstemons covered a considerable range of pinks, reds and purples, many with white throats to their tubular flowers, some with white out- side as well, and just a few that were all white. They varied in flower size but most were 18 to 24 in high, some even more. Most of these varieties, with the exception of a few of the hardiest, such as Evelyn and Garnet, went out of fashion after the Second World War, when some of the companies that had specialised in them went out of business or changed to other specialities. Gradually the seedsmen stepped in, producing seed strains of penstemons, which filled some, but by no means all, the gaps left by the lack of interest in the more expen- sively maintained varieties propagated by cuttings. They still continue to be grown and there have been several trials of these seed- raised pnstemons in the Ryal Hmorticunltural Society's grden at Wisley, Surrey, but nothing on the scale of the trial of old \"named\" varieties grown in the old-fashioned way from cut- tings, which is being held at Wisley this year and will con- tinue through the winter and during next spring and sum- mer to find out Just how hardy (or tender) the plants are. It is an interesting trial for many reasons. For one thing, it reveals how many of the old varieties still exist, and how many of the stocks that are still around have acquired wrong names during the years of neglect. There are many rea- sons why this happens, most of them quite accidental. Name- tallies get lost, are erased or are mixed up. Gardeners sup- ply plants with the most likely names they can remember, which may not be the correct ones, or simply give them names for use in their own gar- dens and then discover that other people have copied them. Whatever the explanation, the Wisley trial is remarkable for two things: one, the num- ber of identical varieties, not always under the same name, that have been sent in from many different sources, and the other, the number of names that have been used for quite dissimilar plants. The judges are having a field-day, sometimes quite literally so, since it can take hours to examine so many plants closely and to attempt to sort out the confusion. The resident botanist at Wis- lay is in sequent demand to give his opinion about varieties bearing dissimilar names, which nevertheless seem to be identical, or, alternatively, have the ame name but seem to be different. Botanists do not usually have special know- ledge of arden variest, but theyar a part in neting w very minute variations whic , if regularly rspuami i mdcate the plants are not identical and may indeed behag to two or more varetls. t may not pthm o iLt to solve a the pblebt t is alrody rt that it wEl st- three rm nt \"ati l Colnsons' o pof smns shold be ableto te ach bette e sorate, IgI- eloered amd l ereliM amo in us Baallynau h, Co Down, North- ern Irland, a National Trot prop to for mlahaowrd ma s ol.

   "text_content" : "IN AUTUMN, thoughtful gardeners regain the ini- tiative. Earlier in the summer, almost anyone can masquerade as an artist. In late June, old-fashioned roses are an open secret; flowers are everywhere and if in doubt, you can always go for a scented philadelphus. In Sep- tember, the gaps begin to show. It takes art and know- ledge to exploit the next six weeks. I am still learning to be artful, but here is a progress report. Artful gardening in autumn should begin with clematis. We all put them where they least like to grow, up walls where the flowerbeds are much too dry. In gardens, as in nature, a clematis is happier growing through a companion or spreading along the ground. I have now learnt to give them their head. I have white clematis on spring-flowering viburnums, reds preparing to climb up lilacs and dark mauves and blues on the leaves of early shrub roses. Both parties are happy with the marriage and my vision of shrubs at this season has changed. Viburnums cease to be green-grey nonentities: they seem to be flowering in white, thanks to the excellent white viticella clematis called alba luxurians. Up a standard lilac, the red Mme Eduard Andre has made a spiral of flower, trained on a circle of wire netting. One of the favourite varieties for scrambling and twining is the deep violet-blue durandit which is creeping happily over a weigela. Every one of these clematis was on sale in the local garden centres among the usual forms with flowers like *cartwheels. More customers ought to think of planting them near their shrubs and pruning them hard in early . They could then look afield for the connoisseurs choice in the family, the bell-shaped flowers on f of the kisE- pink wild clemats from Texas. Etoei Roe is the beat known teeni variety but others are good too, especily Sir Wllam Lawrence. It to quite untrue that these tcanis varieties are dilcult or that they disike direct *mmght. This rt dnri starts by ehaning the arda's hame- work: everything seems to flower again, in a IlfOerwt style and colour. It dependb an two swmI tresR Te e isb shold be planted Abo a yard fromthe bheeofts host r the eason. It shoald also be wathred -O.l-m Was a m than jun lewev to hb asce \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t sary. The ideal total is three gallons of water a week, too much for most of us. I now have a new pattern of present employment, walking from shrub to shrub in the half light, soaking each clematis with a can of water, thinking of nothing of any importance and knowing, for once, that I am doing good. Beyond the clematis, much Robin Lane Fox thinks artful gardening begins with clematis depends on what you choose and whether you have dead- headed earlier in the summer. Diligent deadheaders will be rewarded with a second flower- ing on phloxes and delphini- ums, espelly ifthey have fed them since Auly. A forthe old roses, the same demands apply, but I much prefer the forms which deinitely renat the season. Domens are laid to do so, but few live up to the promise without il. My top three are all pink flowered: cup-shaped Louine Odier, the quilted flowers on Jacques Carter and the lilac- pink Mrs John Laing. By now, black spot has stripped many of their leaves, but these par- ticular roses are flowering again. Why bother with the others as a first choice if they will only flower for a fortnight? Elsewhere, the real excite- ment lies in the expansion of plant-findable shrubs and new- ish half-hardy bedding plants. Unfortunately, they are a tan- gle of complicated names: per- haps they are the reason why other people stick to dahlias. Blue ceratostigma and car- yopteris are enough of a mouthful, but you need to mix them with red and dusky pink phygelius, scarlet zauschneira, purple lespedeza and woolly blue perovbkia. They are enough to sink non-botanists without trace, but they have all changed autumn's hoizons, bringing a depth of red and blue to what risked being an interlude before the stale pink Michaelmas daisies. Above all, art shows in the greater choice of half-hardy plants for bedding. By Septem- ber, traditional anhuals have had their day, unless you are fond of the stronger sorts of petunia. Instead, the half-hardy perennials are going strong, verbenas, penstemons and half-hardy salvias. The hard facts of a British winter usually kills them off, but cuttings are easily taken first and a few stock plants can be potted up and saved indoors. The prizes here are high, along with white and yel- low daisies, silver leaves and late-flowering forms of fuchsia. If I was starting again from scratch, I would weight a bor- der's planting to May and June, rely on shrub roses until mid-July, drape them in late clematis, cut down the early flowers and fill the gaps with these half-hardy bedders. Ten years ago, my ideas of autumn were much more limited, but the usual weather makes it too lovely to be left to chrysanthe- mums. In gardening, too, the art is changing and it is up to us to advance the frontiers.",

   "text_content" : "Wildlife: FT writers report from Botswana and the Galapagos islands, while a third sings the praises of photo-safaris 4am and 5am is when life burns at -its lowest flame and the silence of the bush is total. That was the time I chose to do sentry duty over our party of campers sleeping out in the veld: stoke the fire, watch for eyes that glint in the dark, lis- ten for the sounds of danger. I heard and saw nothing. All I felt was the cold stabbing through multiple layers of clothing. When my watch ended, I crawled back to sleep, savouring my self-image as intrepid adventurer on the trail Altogether, we were eight brave souls on trek in the Mashatu game reserve which borders the bone-dry Limpopo river in Botswana. We were shepherded through the bush on foot by Johannes, an old Tswana tracker who carried a anm - for reasons known to haief, as it would scarcely have daunted Mashatu's large population of elephants. Barry, our 24-year-old South African ranger, provided infor- mation, entertainment, food, sundowners, jokes and the security of a gun. Ranged like sausage rolls Along a ground sheet under the stars, we slept the sleep of the ignorant. At dawn, lone figures trudged off with loo roll and spade, and came back full of the joys of the early morning bush. No-one noticed anything amiss until Johannes, the eyes and ears of the group, came stammering into camp, jumbl- ing English and Afrikaans, to tell us that we had shared our campsite with two lionesses and five cubs. They had passed the night not 150 yards away, and fresh spoor revealed they had come to peer at us while we slept. Johannes had discovered them while on his morning pil- grimage with the spade, his hands at his belt (as he glee- fully told us). He quickly mar- shalled us to track them down. When we found them, they were moving silently through the bush with the nonchalance which only lions can affect. We had not taken the truck because lions (inexplicably) fear man on foot more than vehicles; slowly, the peven stalked past us before settling down for another lazy day in the sun. Luckily, we had few such close encounters. Indeed, as one of the teenagers in our group said, we spent a lot of time looking at trees as a sub- stitute for wildlife. Speaking as someone who runs slowly, and cannot climb trees even when a black rhino is threatening me with extinction, I prefer the illusion of danger to the fact. Patti Waldmeir has some close encounters on the African trail So the five-day Ivory Trail, run by Clive Walker and his Wil- derness Trust in Botswana's arid Tull block, suited me per- fectly. There was ample opportu- nity for titillation: several times we nearly stumbled on elephant cows and calved in thick bush; we passed a deadly black mamba snake, which took one look at us and disap- peared down a hole in the ground; and when one of our party kicked what she thought was a dead puff adder, it moved away, affronted. But most of our time was spent enjoying the pleasant stupor induced by the wild. We rose at 6am - most nights were spent at a base camp with tents and camp beds, a bucket shower, \"long drop\" loo and reftigerator for the alcoholics among us - and set off at 7am. That is not an hour of the day I normally study closely, but the pale tawny colours of the bush at dawn made it worth sacrific- ing sleep. After driving along dirt tracks for an hour or so - wrapped In blankets against th deep chill - we trekked off after Johannes and Barry,. picking burr out of our socks every few yards. We tried to keep quiet, but few animals will wait around to be spotted by 10 humans crashing through the underbrush. Occasionally, we glimpsed wildebeest through trees, the tiny steenbok, always on its own, or a jackal in the dis- tance. Once we watched while hundreds of impala raced and leapt past us, accompanied by a herd of galloping zebra and followed by a lone ostrich run- ning like a cartoon road-run- ner. One day, at dusk, we climbed a kopie to find 200 elephants- browsing on the plain below. Barry said it was a \"clan gath- ering\" of several elephant fami- lies, but the food seemed to be the normal diet of dried grasses and acacia branches studded with 3-inch thorns which unaccountably slip straight through an elephant's digestive tract. The rest of the time we were at leisure to enjoy the sudden scent of wild sage in a dry river bed; the tortured shapes of the bushveld, the chartreuse \"fever\" trees on riverbanks, the stunted water acacia with its vicious white thorns. Every day ended with the sharp chill of evening punctuating the warm dusk, the sound of the jackal's laughing bark - and the baboon's sharp complaint. From our perch on top of a kopje at sunset, large quanti- ties of red wine easily induced contemplation: of the awe, the majesty, the brutality of the bush. For the harassed or the worried, there can be no more total form of relaxation. M Contact: Clive Walker Trails, Johannesburg (011)-453- 7645/6/7; fax: (011)-453-7649.

   "text_content" : "SIX HUNDRED miles off the Pacific coast of Ecuador lie the darkly volcanic islands of the Galapagos. They used to be called the Enchanted Islands, so named by a Bishop of Panama who discovered them accidentally after drifting off course in a storm. In a letter to the King of Spain he described the giant tortoises (galapago in Spanish) he had found there. Just under 300 years later Charles Darwin, the Galapagos' most famous visitor, arrived on the Beagle and stayed five weeks, working on his theory of evolution. Ten thousand people live there today, but the islands - 13 large, six small, and innumerable islets - have retained an innocence which the Ecuadorian government is doing its best to preserve by attempting to control tourism. Visitors are only allowed to go ashore with a qualified guide and have to keep to well-marked paths. But you can swim with the sea lions and the world's second smallest penguin, and bird- watchers are in their element: there are 58 resident species, of which 28 are endemic to the Galapagos. We flew from Quito to the tiny island of Baltra and then transferred to the 1,500-ton, 90-passenger MV Santa COm, our home for the next three days. On board, Fernando, our Ecuadorian guide, handed us the Galapagos National Park's strict conservation rules and a small linen bag to accommodate any rubbish we might spot as we traipsed around. To keep to a maximum of 20 visitors per guide, passengers were divided into groups called albatrosses, boobies, cormorants, dolphins and frig- ate birds. We landed on different islands each day in rubber dinghies called pngas and on North Seymour had our first sight of the barren landscape, giant prickly pear cactus and silvery white bare-branched polo snit trees so typi- cal of the islands. Here, too, was a colony of frigate birds with brilliant red mating poches that they inflate like balloons to woo females cruising overhead.

There are five volcanoes and a cobalt blue salt lake crater named after Dar- win on Isabela, the largest of the islands. A sandy trail through honey- scented yellow-flowered cordia bushes led us to a view of dark craters in lava fields that stretched forever. In Tagus cove early whalers had scratched the still visible names of their ships on the rocks, and it was here that we spotted a Galapagos penguin and an iguana that had lost its tail to a playful seallon but would be able, we were told, to grow two more. These marine iguanas, sometimes 4 ft long and the only sea-going lizard in the world, covered the rocks on Fernan- dina island. They are like tiny dino- saurs with black-and-pink scaly skins, Angela Wigglesworth strolls among the blue-footed boobies on the isles of evolution long tails, spiky manes, strong claws and glittery little eyes. \"Hideous looking creatures,\" Darwin called them. Fernando would permit no straggling. \"This way, cormorants,\" he would call, and we followed him over black lava coiled like frosen rope to see turtles swimming, selions barking and two flightless cormorants - the only place in the world they are found - preening themselves on the rocks. The best place to wthe the giant 0 bs tortoises for which the islands are famous is at the Charles Darwin research station on Santa Cruz.

You dl k tI * to ag lt b t Led ea-ned . le beat way to coupe lh Imeeibl problems and headaches is to take it easy for the first few days (plus a few aspirins), for Quito is a city well worth being well enough to enjoy. It has ornate churches and cobbled streets, palaces, plazas filled with trees and flowers, blue-balconied colonial-style houses and the street music of haunting pipes played in sunny squares. Quito's altitude gives it the climate of a warm spring, despite its closeness to the equator only 15 miles away. At the equatorial monument there you can stand with one foot in each hemisphere. The autoferro is a kind of bus that runs from Quito to Riobamba on a sin- gle-gauge rail track following the ancient route of the Incas. Passengers travel inside and a few, from choice in our case, on the roof. Our driver read his newspaper over the steering wheel and hooted his way through the forests of the Avenue of the Volcanoes, scatter- ing people, cows, donkeys and llamas off the track while dogs raced alongside like greyhounds chasing a hare. We had a couple of unscheduled stops: the driver's mate got off to catch a chicken and we all got off to help shift a truck stuck across the track. We rattled past damp forests, blue- grey eucalyptus and white-trumpeted datura trees, fields of white feathery grass and flashes of scarlet flowers. On our right glittered the cone-shaped, snow-topped Cotapaxi, at 20,000 ft the highest active volcano in the world - on three occasions it has destroyed the town of Latacunga beneath it. At a small Sunday-quiet town we stopped to see a carpet-maker demon- strate his craft and in Latacunga's huge market watched old women in tall hats sitting among melons and pineapples, shelling peas and beans and popping live chicks into paper bags. At Banos, the nearest we got to the jungle, old men took photographs with DICW-DUX cUe[ aw a- u am Cr[uu in wicker baskets covered with newspa- pers.

   "text_content" : "THERE IS a lot to be said for shooting wildlife with a camera. There e n aone of the problems of taking firearms across borders, you leave the animal or bird unharmed for other photographers to capture, and you are not lumbered with tiresome trophies. Moreover, you have the excuse of visiting some spectacular creatures you would not be allowed anywhere near with a gun. For my first quarry I would choose the largest and one of the most dramatic land mammals, the African elephant, and would travel to the national parks of Chobe (Botswana), Hwange (Zimbabwe) or the Luangwa Valley (Zambia) where elephants can still be seen and photographed in sizeable herds. These destinations also offer the possibility of going on foot to visit the giants, without doubt the best way of experiencing the African bush and one which adds excitement to the encounter. Ten days will generally cost from Â£1,730. Among numerous operators, you could start by trying Abercrombie and Kent, Art of Travel, Swan Hellenic or Twickers World. Walking is the only way to reach the next animals on my list, the gorillas in Rwanda and Zaire. Although romping with them, Attenborough-fashion, is not allowed, just being close to them is a moving experience. From Â£1,475 for 24 days (with up to four days with the gorillas) or from Â£850 for four days as a safari extension, try A&K, Twickers World or Wildlife Safari. The orang utan, found in the primary forests of Sabah (Borneo), is another of the great apes to see. A good place to photograph them is the Sepilok sanctuary near Sandakan. From Â£1,400 for 14 days. While in the east it would be worth looking for the largest of the cats, the tiger. In Corbett and Ranthambhor national parks (India) and Chitwan national park (Nepal), searches for tigers are carried out from the backs of elephants and it is difficult to think of a more exciting way of seeing them. 15 days will cost around Â£1,800 with Cox and Kings or Twickers World. Australia's wildlife, while spread quite thinly on the mainland, is often concentrated on its islands. I would go to Tasmania for eastern grey kangaroos, Bennetts wallabies, Tasmanian devils and a host of smaller creatures, while Kangaroo island, South Australia, is excellent for koalas and very approachable Australian sea-lions. Trips to both are led by professional naturalists. Tasmania will cost about Â£670 for seven days from Melbourne with Australia, while Kangaroo island can be explored with Adventure Charters - Â£376 for four days from Adelaide. The wildlife on the North American continent is often Disneyesque in its accessibility and confiding nature. National parks like Yellowstone (US) and Banff and Jasper (Canada) have populations of elk, moose, grizzly and black bears which, together with Yellowstone's bison, are frequently seen at the roadside. Travelling in North America is very . simple and I would take a fly-drive - a pre-planned one visiting the above parks will cost from Â£1,500 for three weeks with British Airway's Poundstretcher. Simply to experience the beauty of Alaska and the Canadian Arctic will be enough for most people, but for the wildlife photographer Churchill during the autumn polar bear migration is the prime site, where specially-designed Tundra Bggies allow you to photograph these large carnivores in safety. Ten days here will cost around Â£1,650 with Arctic Experience. There are numerous whale-watching cruises available in North America. Vancouver Island is especially good for orcas (killer whales), and bold visitors can kayak among the pods of whales there. Further south, off Baja, California, there are opportunities to see grey, finback, blue, humpback and killer whales, often from an inflatable dinghy, during January-March. For the northern whales, Arctic Experience offers 14 days for a little over Â£1,800, while for the same price you can get 10 days of whales off Baja with Cox and Kings and Twickers World. For sheer numbers of wildlife all in one place, though, East Africa must win the prize with jewels like Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve, which is joined across the Tanzanian border with the Sereneti national park. Among other species, you stand a gedu chance ofptgrphg lio, lsofr, elephant, b ,alo. and, if you are there for the migration, a mass of wlbudust. Notto bemissedis the Ngou ugro crater in the Serennget, while eanyar's Samburu game reserve ofers that little extra for the discerniang pbotorapher.

   "text_content" : "oki00 Brninreor the bomi% lrtt~gl orsp~etes. HE majority of the 1,900 club courses in Britain were completed by the 1920s. There were few coun- terparts to the late Victorian and Edwardian golf course developers in the mid-or post-war years and little commercial interest in greens and club-houses until the end of the 1980s. Since then, however, there has been an avalanche of planning appli- cations for the change-of-use of sur- plus farmland and country house parks into chic golf centres, followed by widespread inactivity as many of these schemes have run into the buffers of recession. A few years ago The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, Scotland, spiritual home of the put- ting and driving classes, warned that so many golfers were chasing so few club places that Britain needed at least another 700 new courses in the 1990s to satisfy existing demand for the game. That is more new golf facilities in ten years than have been added to the country's course lists in the past 80. However, a combination of. the slump in agricultural revenues and land values, planners' evident enthu- siasm for developments that merely re-shape rather than cover open space, and an universal passion among banks and other funding groups not to miss out on the leisure property boom inspired developers a-plenty. Would-be golf course builders became so active that the leisure development staff of surveyors Strutt & Parker warned of an immi- nent oversupply. By tracking plan- ning applications the surveyors con- cluded that the proposed new-building rate in the south east of England would reach and pass the Royal & Ancient's estimates of ! mld-190s06. sic dowituta me tye* ty avhilable zv een the forcdd with outline use at a golf golf projects -sive ee: dbnil develop- the greens, but their enthusi- d of golf-courise s the commer- Sos the holiday Sestateps-*IoK In the US. e at the end of nuch the samew r-side marina 5 to build over lave to mowit; , play on it., :Â· & Ancient's, dlevision cover- erest in fitnessw Icrease in the sing, watchings ut golf.

Having a golf course at the end of the garden justifies much the sania premium as a water-side marina home. No-one is going to build over your view; you don't have to mowit; you can, if so inclined, play on it. As the Royal & Ancient's researches confirm, television cover- age and increased interest in fitness- has spurred a big increase in the number of people playing, watching,' or merely talking about golf. Add to the mix the 2,000 people each month whsno-w take voluntary retirement -in teir 50s and who aim to trade across \"the housing market to an active 'retirement home and you have growing prospective demand for Ã½auch homes, tallied with an exceedingly limited supply.

There are 275 houses in the main island site within the golf courses at the Wentworth Estate where the bottom marker on prices is, or was, close to three quarters of a million pounds. These days, no one is quite sure where that line should be drawn. There was a ready market for these big country houses throughout the 1980s. The Estate is secure, developer-free, just 40 minutes from Central London and with eveteasier access to the airports; ideal as a Brit- slh base for an international buyer or as one of the smarter sections of. London's middle-distance stockbro- ker belt. Now, KF&R alone has 17 of these big mid-war broker's mansions on offer from Â£2.7midown - and only a handful of viewers. There were expectations that Jap- * anese buyers would head for Went- worth after last year's new issue of stock in the estate and golf course proved so success] in that country. Howeveir .1apane 'investors who were ha^j to bi the stock and who enjOy Ut coMi e still prefer to buy and .ive in ctral London. Withoutan d buyig interest rom p of the range golf pror ' as badly hit as the rest uilKmsu -premium com- muter hoh Peo l simply do not have, or will not commit, the cash to trade up. \"These properties were the last to be affected by the slow-down in activity at the end of the 1980s and they are looking as though they will be among the last to come back 'again,\" says Watson. Most of the homes on offer are pressure sales of one kind or another; either because of financial or marital difficulties or, commonly, a combination of the two. Golf enthusiasts with an eye to a bargain are unlikely to get either a wider choice of houses, or as much scope to haggle over asking prices, as they can today. Sunningdale can claim one record over its rival course at Wentworth in the form of the largest recorded price reduction. Kingsmoor, an AEdwardian country retreat in three acres of gardens next to the Sun- ningdale course, was on the market :for month after month at an asking pric of Â£21.5m. Earlier this year, when the mortgage lenders repos- sesped the house, the price was slashed to Â£775,000. Kingsmoor has since been sold, but prospective buy- der will not find any shortage of equivalent houses to tour. Ow oasis of activity in the midst of this log-jammed market has been rbeckenridge Estates' newly-built Whinshill Court development on Cross Road in Sunningdale. Fifteen flats and houses were won from the site of a single mid-war mansion. That kind of scheme, forcing the housing density off iny scale that the original builders could have imagined, can destroy the very qual- Ities that made the site attractive in the first place. You need only look at one of the crammed infill sites in suburbia to see what a scaled-down mock-Georgian terrace (usually with Tudor overtones) can do to the site of a former semi-detached house. Here, however, the developers have been playing to a different mar- ket. They have been able to spend their way around the cramming problem by building big - 2,500 to 3,000 sq foot - apartments with a finish in accord with the site. Prices of Â£430,000 for three bed apartments and Â£930,000-plus for the larger pent- houses are more prime central Lon- don than Berkshire. But these flats have been selling as locals trade down and international buyers who otherwise would have been looking at individual homes have been attracted by the opportunity to buy new properties on a scale that gives them enough, rather than too much, home for their needs.",

   "text_content" : "TO APPEAR oneself or have one's property appear on television or film still holds a certain magic for many people. It is hardly surprising that television or film companies take some advantage of this when mak- ing arrangements for film locations. It may not occur to a property owner to ask for money. You may be too carried away with finding out the iame of the production, what stars may be involved and so on. Television and film executives will use their charm. \"Do come and watch the shooting. We'll fix you up with a front-row seat. I'm sure you'd like to meet the stars.. .1 know they'd like to meet you.\" Sometimes the director or loca- tion manager will broach the sub- ject of money. \"How about a. dona- tion to your favourite charity? Is there a restoration fund for your church?\" That, together with the glamour (or imagined glamour) is often eiougkh to keep property own- ers happy - for the time being. The honeymoon can be brief. When you find that the filming is taking twice as long as indicated, that your house is no longer yonr own, that your lavatories are always in use, that yodr friends can- not get near the place because of the cars and vans, that your telephone is constantly engaged, you may begin to wonder if the game is worth it. Almost certainly it will not be - unless, that is, you know enough at theoutset to prevent this. When negotiating terms, do not be too impressed by the argument that thete are plenty of other good locations. You have been approached because your property is especially suitable - sometimes for reasons which will not be appar- ent to the layman. Once location managers have found a place they usually go to considerable lengths to obtain it. To travel around view- ing alternative sites is expensive and time-consuning and film mak- ers are usually short of time. Television and film companies have a regular requirement for country .,ocations. It is not Just houses or cottages: the requirement can be for a pond or lake, farm buildings, a wood, village shop, gar- den, fields, stables or open country. To hire a fully e'ipped studio and build a set-is exi~sive. It is far bettervvalue to.. i* location. A location withtW;ai; e of London is the most sought ifter. If filming takes place more than this distance from London the crew, which can have up to 60 members in the case of a feature film, have to be paid subsistence, which can be Â£30 or more per person per day. That is not to say, however, that locations ar- not also required in deepest Devon- shire or Cumbria. I am told that a minimum of Â£500 per day or part of a day for outside filming is the going rate. For inside filming, Â£1,000 is the minimum per day or part of a day. Do not accept a lower rate for days spent in \"prepar- ing\" locations, as the disturbance is probably just as great as for actual shooting. And it is important to charge for the use of premises as opposed to just \"filming\". . These matters, and such essen- tials as insurance and third party liabilities, need to be put in a writ- ten agreement, preferably prepared with legal advice. All this may seem a far cry from grateful acceptance of what at first appears to be a heaven- sent opportunity to fund, say, the church roof repairs, but it is vital that you should know how to react when that delightful location man- ager first knocks on the door. S The Country Landowners Associ- ation of 16 Belgrave Square, London SW1 (071-235-0511) has prepared a pamphlet on filming contracts. It is however, available to members only. Michael Stourton",

You will have heard of the free car, of 50-0 purchase schemes, give-away family holidays, \"soft\" loans and subsidised mortgage schemes, as well as the universal price discounts which are all aimed at attracting buyers in the still sluggish new homes market in Britain. Birmingham-based Carla Homes has gone one better by bidding early for Christmas. A Cartier watch, jewellery, a mountain bike... you name it, Carla Homes (Midlands) wants prospective home buyers to say what they would like for Christmas, then - assuming you complete the purchase of one of their homes by December 25 - it will provide the presents and throw in a free Christmas dinner. This new venture in residential marketing opens up a range of possibilities. Children of the 1990s may come to bid over the heads of their parents to a housebuilder, rather than waste time whispering their ambitions to some store's seasonal Santa. And imagine the family pressure for a move each year. This could give a whole new meaning to the term \"demographic shift\". John Brennan",

   "text_content" : "Paul Newburg travels to Sverdlovsk and finds sparks of the' entrepreneurial spirit THE RUSSIANS have often been written off as an inert mass when it comes to private enter- prise. But to judge by Boris Yeltsin's home town Sverd- lovsk, that is unfair. Sverdlovsk is a city of nearly 1.5m people domi- nated by heavy industry and defence plants that have tradition- ally offered their employees secure jobs as well as peppercorn-rent housing and many subscribed ame- nities. But that is all changing. Private enterprise is doing well enough to have created alternative market in the city and the state firms are being deserted by some of their best people. Uralmash, the big- gest enterprise in Sverdlovsk, with close to 50,000 employees, has had to raise wages by half this year in an effort to stem the tide. Others have followed suit. Deserters .ose their job security, their he queue for accom- m ~ ~ther welfare rights. But lure of the money to ~ private enterprise too On repreneurs they are jo t o Gritsenko. A large men of 30 with a boyisil tirid face, black rimmed spectacles and shy laugh, he is tough, ingenious, persistent and brave, the stuff of which empire- builders are made. ,He was a mechanic with a big local defence plant before he started his metal-working business in a shed on marshland at Baltim, just outside Sverdlovsk. It took him 18 months to find a state farm that would lease him a greenfield site and to gather the capital and the political support he needed - including endorsement and a loan from the Communist youth league, the Komsomol, eager at at the time to encourage young entrepreneurs. His business is a tovarishstvo - a comradeship - a term invented to beguile conservatives, even though the form ofprivate enterprise it cov- ers is much .mnre-lle &.weste r\"' limited liabilcomiiipa th pri- vate and institutional investors, he has built three huge hangers since he started in the autumn of 1990, and is laying the foundations of an office block complete with a swim- ming pool and a sauna for himself and his workforce, even though he has yet to get planning permission. \"Its cheaper to pay the fine than to wait around,\" he says with his boyish laugh, acknowledging at the same time that he is in a hurry to create facts. A measure of this is that only one of his three hangars is in use. There, his machines, mostly second- hand and churning out much- needed plumbers' supplies, are packed close and running all the time, to repay the cost and the immense trouble it took to procure them. \"The men work three days on 12-hour shifts; then they have three days off\" he says,\"We've worked nonstrbp for over six months, inchiding holidays and weekends.\" The 50 men he has doing those shifts are paid beyond what they could dream of in a state job. \"The minimum is Rbs700, the maximum Rbs3,000, which is about ten times the average in a state firm,\" Grit. senko says. To maintain the pace, how.er, he . als4 has a system of leB of labour disci- pitRbs500. 't s O peple as much as he < -has hiarto be wily. The Soviet Bank has introduced measurei aimed at ensuring that private sector employees earn little more than those inthe state jobs. He relies on his accountant, \"We're all to some extent in conflict with the law, and that's her job,\" he says. \"The more the workers earn, the more I earn and the more she earns, if she can't solve the prob- lem, I'll have to find another accountant.\" Most important he pays in cash, and cash which does not come from his bank. \"The bank won't issue cash for wages just like that, but I don't have any problems with the bank,\" he laughs. \"I have cash like that in my shop, which I can take out when I need to pay the wages.\" The shop is a general store he took over recently in Baltim. It sells a lot of things that are hard to find: matches, sugar, sausages, cigarettes ,and4lelIe gets them through bar- ter fr. his metal products, some- times, traveling to Lithuania, over 1,500 miles by car He':believes that barter, which has largely taken over from money, is bad for the country, and the sooner it reverts to normal trade the better for business and the con- sumer. But meanwhile he is making full use of the barter system. The I: ZÂ·-.':Â·: Â·Â· ~''\"~~~Â· r.Â·~; i \"z.i~l Â·; ~jÂ·'rÂ·~kiW\\ Building the future: Konstantn Grienko In front of one of Me hangers he has corucled to house MI plumbing suppliM and nrter MIusnew Â·' Â· .. $ Â·Â· ''' 'R r .er r ;1 goods brought back by him and his staff of traders - together with the shop staff, another 50 people ensure that his shop does roaring business seven days a week, even though his prices are at free-market levels. This means that he is not only making maximum profit on his metal products, but is never short of cash. Not surprisingly, he is plan- ning to open more shops this year. But being able to pay his workers cash is not the only benefit Grit- senko draws form his shop. In Rus- sia, only state enterprises are offi- cially entitled to raw materials. Even small private companies work- ing for the state companies have great difficulty obtaining supplies. To get metal, Gritsenko pays twice as much as state enterprises pay. But being preparted to pay would not alone be enough to do the trick. \"I have to give presents to the people in a position to sell me metal. That is where my shop comes in. I stock foodstuffs in short supply all over Russia. At present there are problems with butter, \"with sugar, big problems with beer. So I give them a to the people who have metal at enterprises,and we obtain the metal we need.\" Gritsenko is exceptional, most people in Sverdlovsk who have the entrepreneurial bug are too worried about uncertainties and too scared of the immense task of securing machinery and raw materials, to want to produce anything. They opt for trade instead. Sasha, a former taxi driver, spends his week going round car spare part shops in country areas, buying what spares he can find. If he hears of a shop where a whole consignment is about to be deliv- ered, he rushes there to buy as much of it as he can. On Saturdays, he takes his stock to Shuvakish, a market for cars and spare parts. The cars are mostly second hand, the spares mostly new, made in state factories but hard to find in state shops. At Shuvakish, they can be had, but not at the same price. \"If it's some small part not in great demand, then I sell it f6 little more â¢an [ rice in th-ps,\" Sasha if it's g sought i I charge times the price, someti even ten times more\" Until recently it was an offence for a private person to buy some- thing at one price and sell it at a higher price. With perestroika the law has been changed, to allow trade in goods bought at commer- cial prices but making a profit from re-selling goods bought at a state price remains a crime. On Sundays, there is another market at Shu- vakish, where dealers sell goods from cosmetics, clothes and crockery to video tapes and microchips. Apart from bigger dealers who may never come to the market, a host of private trading companies have sprung up in Sverd- lovsk dealing in everything from currency to shoes to scrap metal. The majority of what these trad- ers do is legal, or almost legal. \"There is quite a lot of uncertainty about the legislation at the moment, and there have been situa- tions where we have done some- thing that is illegal one day, but legal the next,\" says one, referring to currency deals. People play dice with the law. He who dares and calculates well enough, wins a lot. A much bigger problem is that most entrepreneurial energy goes into trading in goods in short sup- ply, rather than making more. \"Entrepreneurs are afraid of investing money in anything long term,\" says Sergi Burkov of the Sverdlovsk Economic Institute. \"In trade, their turnover brings them profits without major problems. In these conditions, entrepreneurs who put money into developing produc- tion and manufacturing, are the heroes of our time.\" And mostly unappreciated heroes at that. For one of the side-effects of Russian entrepreneurs' concentra- tion on trade, and their often phe- nomenal profit percentages has been a backlash of popular resent- ment. This is understandable, not lust as a result of the egalitarian pfopaganda and semi-egalitarian life-style of the last 70 years, but also as a product of the slump in living standards masses of people have suffered. The term co-operative, signalling the first form of private enterprise allowed under Gorbachev's reforms in 1988, has become almost a word of abuse in popular parlance. Many co-ops in Sverdlovsk have re-regis- tered as something ele to escape the opprobrium.n What they have found harder to escape is the effect of the reversal of tax concessions they originally enjoyed as -an encouragement to reforms of business. \"Thirty five per cent of the profit goes on income tax, 26 per cent on social insurance, 11 per cent for eco- nomic stabilisation, 5 per cent as sales tax, 1 per cent to the pension fund,\" says Nikol Gogloyev, chir- man of a small co-opetative he started-in a disused building in a semi-residential part of Sverdlovsk in 1988. It makes heat-resistant conveyor belts out of wifemesh bound by hand in a pattern he invented, for industrial customers as far away as Switzeland, \"At the beginning, taxes were low, now they're so high, many ceopse are going 6%t otbsns A & eOr in d everg4 v erJialf the 1,500 co-ops operate in- what is known in Russia ai the shadow economy, says Boris ,Gulayev, Chairman of the Sverdlovsk Coop- eratives Association, and their lob- byist on the City Council \"A lot of co-operatives become shadow coops,\" he says, \"becapse they can't get materials, thy can't get technology, they ca get pet- roL So they have to find a sponsor', who has access to state-owned materials and gives them some for a bribe. And because they've done this, they need some sort of protec- tion, so they bring in the police, who also get paid for their services. They're all-'friends, all in it together.\" '' In the nds of all this, however, Konstantin Gritsenko is not alone in making a success of it on the open side of the economy in Sverd- lovsk. A building company run by Vladimir Konkov, a construction engineer, and registered as an even more convoluted form of business than Gritsenko's tovatishstvo, employs about 1,000 people on hous- ing and other construction jobs, some abroad. SP Ural, a company started by Vladimir Koskov with a Rbs1,000 in his pocket in 1988, embraces 40 subsidiaries and affili- ates spread across the Soviet Union, making or assembling a range of electronic equipment and trading in a huge variety of goods, with Rbs3,000 employees and a turnover of millions. The entrepreneurial spirit is alive. It could transform a country which for seven decades could only just survive a process of self-de- struction, into a land of boom. * Paul Newburg produced All Change for Svedlovsk, a documen- tary on Channel Four. _______ - .- ...jM"

   "text_content" : "William Weaver recalls Sir William Hamilton's passion for Vesuvius Hudaol on a royal vt to Varis t the tiw the 1771 eetio A T THE end of last month, a four-day international confer- ence on \"active vol-. canoes and risk mitigation\" was held in Naples in the Cas- tel ,ell'Ovo, within sight of the now apparently peaceful cone of Vesuvius. The occasion also marked the 180th anniversary of the Osservatorio Vesuviano, founded in 1841 by the Bour- bon king Ferdinando H, and directed by a succession of eminent volcanologlst, includ- ing Giuseppe Mercalli, who devised the scale by which si- entists still measure the inten- sity of eruptions. While specialists from over half-a-dozen nations, from Italy to Japan, discussed magnotel- luric soundings and slope instability, a benevolent and interested ghost was surely haunting the historic and familiar castle: Sir William Hamilton, whose stay in Naples (from 1764 to 1796) coin- cided not only with a turbulent and exciting period in Neapoli- tan history but also with a series of natural upheavals, which stimulated the curiosity of that enlightened English- man and led him to study the phenomena of Vesuvius and the other volcanic areas with the profound, exploratory attention of a true 18th century dilettante. And Hamilton's studies, reported in a series of letters to the Royal Society, were the basis of the modern science of volcanology. Hamilton's stay in Naples, which covered half of his life, was important for many rea- sons (of which perhaps the least significant today is his second marriage, to Emma Hart, later mistress of Lord Nelson in one of the nost noto- rious mdnages d trois in his- tory). Sent to the Bourbon-cap- ital as royal envoy to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Hamilton soon became a fix- ture of the elegant court; and, in his several houses, he estab- lished something of a court himself: all important visitors to Naples - then one of the great cosmopolitan cities of Europe - sought him out, eager to see his celebrated col- lection and, if they were lucky, secure him as their guide to the mysterious volcanic areas or the ruins of Pompeii. The story of Hamilton's life has been told many times; but a recent magnificent and informed volume by Carlo Inight, Hamilton a Napoli, concentrates on the enduringly sgnificant aspects of that life, and, as the title indicates, on the English diplomat's rela- tions with the singularly lov- able, all too easily misunder- stood, and now sadly desecrated Campanian city. Hamilton was, first of all, a collector. His pictures included many fine works, by Luini, Reni, Veronese, Neapolitans like Solimena and Schedoni, and a number of (then) con- temporary artists whom Hamil- ton encouraged, notably Peter Fabris, Philipp Hackert and the ungrateful Elisabeth Vigee LeBrun (who, like Hackert, was commissioned to paint a portrait of Emma). But, more Important, Hamilton systemati- cally assembled a collection of Etruscan, Greek and Roman antiquities, which he published in two elaborately illustrated volumes. Subsequently, he published other volumes, including his Campi Phlegrei with superb illustrations by Fabris (most of the originals are now in the British Library). Hamilton's publications are now extremely rare: not only because they were issued in limited editions, but also because surviving vol- umes were often vandalised, the illustrations torn out to be sold separately. Published by Electa Napoli, Knight's Hamilton a Napol is as attractive to look at as it is illuminating to read. Not only are many Fabris illustrations sensitively reproduced (there are countless colour plates), but there are also other views of Naples, reproductions of the watercolours of Giovanni Morghen for The Antiquities of Herulaneum, and drawings by Padre Plaggio for the \"Vesu- vian Diary\" that the aged scholar-priest dutifully kept for Hamilton (who paid him a sorely-needed stipend for the task). In Naples, Hamilton did not live in a vacuum, and in telling the story of this eccentric mil- ordo Knight does not hesitate to digress. There are informed and charmingly informative pages on Naples's place in the Grand Tour, on the life of Padre Piaggio (who was the first to invent a way of reading the charred papyri recovered at Herculaneum). A brief his tory of the Neapolitan gouache offers a brilliant footnote to the history of tourism, of souvenir- collecting, and of art. In another, equally well-docu mented and original book, Snight has told the story of the ngsh Garden that Hamilton persuaded Queen Maria Caro- lina to have made in the vast park at Caserta. Here the story is briefly retold, from a differ- ent angle, and Hamilton's role is justly underlined. But, above all, looms Vesu- vius. In his last years in Naples, it had become a kind of obsession with Hamilton, as it was for the Neapolitans who lived under its threat. Accord- ing to Plaggio's diary, in the time of Carlo, the first Bourbon king of Naples, a courtier suggested eliminating Vesu- vus by levelling it and redi- recting its lava flow. In those pre-bulldozer days, he asked to have 29,000 men at his com- mand. Carlo refused indig- nantly, saying, \"If these [erup- tions] are the effects of second causes we cannot prevent them. If they are scourges in the hand of Him who is the Prime Cause, we must not elude them.\" In what became a real love for the volcano, Hamilton - also taking a moral tone - found a way or arguing that, in the end, the eruptions were a good thing, as even from their most destruc- tive manifestations, benefits were derived. It is unlikely that the scien- tists gathered in Naples for the International Conference devoted much time to the moral question; but the pro- gramme included a paper of Sir William Hamilton, and while satisfying a need for informa- tion, this recognition surely also fulfils a moral obligation. Obligatory, too, would be the prompt publication of Knight's absorbing volume in English.",

My local stockist doesn't seem to stock them. Yours, Curious of Caversham. Dear Mr Andrews, A French friend tells me there is a video version of Sartre's L'Rtre Et Le Neant as performed by the inmates of asylum of Charen- ton under the direction of Meryl Streep. Is this true? Where can I find it? I much enjoy your column. Yours, Francophile of Frinton. Dear Mr Andrews, I much enjoy your video column. Any idea how I can get hold of Bruce Forsyth's Golfing Tips, Luciano Pavarotti's Singing Hits and Jackie Charlton's Fishing Trps? Yours. Sporty of South Shields. Dear readers, Right. I am blowing the whistle. I have had enough. No more letters soften- ing me up with how you enjoy my column and then asking me where you can get such- and-such. The British Video- gram Association will answer all your enquiries on 071-437-5722. This information service is now closed and will re-open only if enquiries drasti- cally decrease. Yours, Nigel Andrews. Yet how could I complain? I of course appreciate your enthusiasm for the video medium. I do my utmost to point you to where you can find the best films in the best showcases. This is at the cin- ema. As the only video critic who regularly attacks video- viewing as a habit, I should like to announce \"See Films Where They Should Be Seen\" week. Hundreds of lookalike Nigel Andrewses will be on patrol outside regional cinemas from next Sunday. All you have to do is recognise the lookalike and show him two freshly bought cinema admis- sion tickets. He will then put you straight on to the Andrews Database service for unlimited video information by phone, post or computer. Let us be fair. Things are looking up in the video market. Last month I pointed to the art films swarming over the hori- zon like brave, determined bees from South America. The attack continues this month. Who could have dreamed that Andrei Tarkovsky and Akira Kurosawa would buzz into cas- sette form while the decade was still young? Throne of Blood and The Seven Samnum (Connoisseur) show the Japa- nese film-maker at his most kinetic: costume adventures in which each frame has the energy and richness of a great painting. Solaris and Stalker (also Connoisseur) are sci-fl fables haunted by a pre-reform Russian's sense of photogenic doom and dereliction. Nothing in modern cinema surpasses Tarkovsky's visionary land- scapes of water, ruin, mud and crumbling buildings. Three other \"art films\" emerge into video this month. Joy is certainly the keynote of Derek Jarman's The Garden (Artificial Eye) and Patrice Leconte's The Hairdresser's Husband (Palace). The first gaily dresses, and undresses, the Creation myth according to modern tastes: with dazzling trick-photography seascapes filmed near Jarman's Dunge- ness home. The second is a merry tale of l'mpossible amour, involving a middleged gent with a weird taste for Arab dancing (Jean Rochefort) and a beautiful young coif- feuse. Pick of the month, though, Is Jan Svankmajer's Alic (ReVi- sion). Lewis Carroll's \"live\" heroine moves among bizarre animated puppets as the Czech surrealist plies his magic Dor- Chem No. S: 1 NaG! (threat 2 Nc7+ Nxc 3 Qd8 mate) bia 2 Rc Resigns. mice build fires in Alice's hair. Six-inch nails dance through frightened socks. Chests of drawers come to life. White rabbits \"bleed\" sawdust. If you doubt that madness and genius are near allied, see this. Little for yourAdelght in the month's commercial releases. Best are the blithe low-budget thriller Miami Blues (Virgin), starring Alec Baldwin as a psy- chopath in Pasteltown; Dis- ney's The Little Mermaid (Buena Vista), memorable for its all-singing, all-dancing cray- fish; and a fond spoof of film- making itself in The Big Pic- ture (20-20), with Kevin Bacon as a young director adrift in vintage Hollywood. Oh I almost forgot the re-is- sue of Douglas Fairbanks's Robin Hood (Virgin). The old- est and still the best of all ver- sions. Rent now while stocks last. Nigel Andrews",

Anything else s pleasant, polite, and ulti- mately meaningless. It is a particular Importance of the present tour by Moscow City Ballet that it is offering performances of the old clas- sics by Lyndmila Semenyaka which are exemplars of the ballerina's art. The Giselle I saw at Northampton's enter- prising Dergate Theatre on Thursday told everything of the identity and function of the ballerina as a uniquely potent figure - and hence told verything of the ballet The production s straightforward, somewhat perfunctory, but that it the way with Russian stagings, which avoid the Romantic flummery that can make Western presentations too quaint for their own good. The design is feeble, yet the very directness and austerity of this Giselle help reassert the importance and, with Semen- yaka, the ritualistic beauty of the ballerina's presence. Nothing matters save the lovely mechanics of her danc- ing, the extreme concentration of her playing. Albrecht, in a sympathetic reading by Sergey Gorbachev, is her porteur; Myrtha, a commanding por- trayal by Natalya Yakovleva, is the force that Giselle's love must overcome. The surround- nlg company - much more coherent and assured than in the Swan Lake of the previous week - provides the necessary setting for Semenyaka's art. And this is extraordinary. She shows us a Giselle fated almost from the first to trag- edy. Berthe's warnings affect her deeply, as if she becomes aware of her destiny. Albrecht's betrayal brings a shocking intensity of madness, her eyes gazing wide at vieions of both past and future. Giselle is a being of extreme gravity, the dance purged of everything save the compas- sionate love which gives it an exquisite dignity. And in each long phrase, each step, there is that Kirov-born clarity and ravishing harmony of execu- tion which sustains the power of her interprotation. We see the entire logic of Gisele as part of the long and glorious history of ballet in Russia: tradition, an apostolic succession from artist to great artist, as a means of preserv- ing and Illuminating a master- piece in the theatre.

   "text_content" : "IMON RATTLE brought his City of Birmingham Symphony to the Proms this week, for the Wednesday and Thursday concerts. The latter consisted of Mahler's Ninth Symphony, and the Albert Hall was packed out (and hot, and sticky); the ear- ler programme - with the vio- linist Gidon Kremer in Sofia Gubaidulina's Offertorin, and the Prokofev Fifth - drew a good house, though with many seats still going spare. Practi- caly anything Rattle does is worth hearing; but on balance I thought the Wednesday audi- ence was luckler Balance was the issue, at least from where I sat. The FT's regular seats are extreme Stalls Left, from where it is easier to appreciate the first violins' shoulder-blades than their playing - mostly invisi- ble and sometimes even inaudi- ble, as too often in this Mahler Ninth. Besides, as Richard Fairman observed here the other day, there are fewer acoustic \"mushrooms\" hanging from the roof this season than there used to be: maybe the result has been peculiarly unfortunate for the audience in the \"H\" sector. Or perhaps the CBSO violins really are a bit under-powered. About half were women. Might there be a grain of truth in the \"masculinist\" claim that female violinists don't carry the same bow-weight? Liter- ally, I wasn't in a position to judge. At any rate the problem surfaced first in Wednesday's Prokofiev, in whose outer movements the CBSO brass - especially the horns, acousti- cally favoured by their central place - regularly wiped out the main violin-tunes. Since Rattle was taking particular care to expose Prokoflev's con- trapuntal voices (widely under- rated), that was a pity. At least the scherzo was properly sharp, even brilliant, and the strings came warmly into their own in the winding Adagio. Nevertheless, the grav- itas that Rattle evidently sought for the crucial first movement was drained by the vanishing strings. The old, demonic Rattle leie the youw Rattle - showed his hand only in the furious codas of Prokwo flev's finale and Mahler's Ron- do-Burleske. He read Mahler's opening \"Andante comodo\" as a spav- ined Adagio. Sheer expressive concentration carried it at first; but very soon the sym- phony became a Concerto for Six Horns (Mahler asked for only four), and the symphonic argument was nearly lost amid those overbearing subsidiary voices. For all the conductor's vivid insights, the Ldndler movement and the Rondo were seriously injured by the same imbalance. The final Adagio, which assigns the horns a lesser role, came as a heartfelt relief. Mahler prescribes \"long bows\" for the strings, and the CBSO players obeyed him to potent effect - even in the coda. With Gubaidulina's 1980 offetoro m there was no com- parable problem. She wrote it foKremer, who delivered it here with searing authority, and Rattle supported its strange construction - tight formal skeleton, wildly eclectic episodes which devolve at last upon a Russian Orthodox vision - with cool expertise. It made a richly disorienting experience: flamboyant but pri- vate, in Gubaidulina's inimita- ble way, and utterly serious. David Murray",

   "text_content" : "HE SOUND of New Orleans seems to be reasserting itself world- wide again in popular jazz. Ladies' man Harry Connick Jnr has them swooning with his crooning, while the Dirty Dozen and Rebirth Brass bands have been blazing a trail around Europe. London's Festival Hall on Wednesday saw a little piece of the Big Easy delivered with some difficulty by a double bill of saxophonist Branford Mar- salis and the young and gifted pianist Marcus Roberts. Difficulties stemmed from the airline's treatment of the Marsalis trio's gear his tenor had lost a pad and Jeff \"Tain\" Watts' drum kit was missing the fairly crucial snare drum. Never mind, the three men are full of braggadocio, Bob Hurst's bass appeared unharmed and Marsalis stuck mostly to the soprano. In a set which mixed stan- dards - Monk's \"Let's Call This\" and \"Cocktails for Two\" - with new material from a forthcoming album, The Beau- tiful Ones Are Not Yet Born (Columbia), the trio coasted initially. Thankfully, proceed- ings were enlivened halfway through by the arrival of the missing piece of kit. Hurst began to rattle the fret more and Marsalis switched to the soprano for some punchier, brighter soloing, interspersed with atmospheric meandering. But 31-year-old Marsalis, whose musical role in Spike Lee's film Mo' Better Blues brought him to a wider than jazz audience, is a chameleon saxophonist. He charms a smooth tone out of the soprano and he approaches Ornette- style hyena utterances. On this showing though, with Watts and Hurst, he combined preci- sion technique with a casual- ness in delivery which lacked fire. Earlier, blind pianist Marcus Roberts, more often heard in the company of Branford's older brother Wynton Marsalis, played a selection of Jelly Roll Morton standards. Roberts is a terrific technician, who pro- vided a sparkling snapshot of his recent album Alone With Three Giants (BMG), where he tackles Monk and Ellington as well as Morton. Garry Booth",

   "text_content" : "LLOYDS BANK'S international open often features newswor- thy surprises. Usually they occur when some schoolboy beats a grandmaster, as in 1981 when Korchno was the victim. Last year's pre-ournament launch game with giant pieces at Marble Arch turned serious when its six-year-old contes- tant set a world age record by trouncing a U4 master. Lloyds BankUl991 was peace- ful for.a couple of rounds, then came the Maosow coup. Bewil- dered Soviet contestants gave their views on Gorbachev and glasnost r Nws at Ten. The Cumberland Hotel donated a chessboard chocolate cake for the USSR players when the coup ended, but some of the Baltsleclined to eat it on polit- ical grounds. Alexei Suetin reveale&tbat Boris Yeltsin had provided a chess centre, open daily, for the city of Sverd- lovsk. Hip 'British listeners reflected that .London's only such centre had ust closed. One day after Latvia pro- claimed independence, its chess players made a virtual sweep of the top awards at Lloyds Bank. Alexei Shirov, 19, won the Â£2,000 first prize with 8/10, half a point ahead of two other Latvians and Britain's Michael Adams. A Latvian took the women's trophy. Shirov has improved so fast that calculations after Lloyds Bank already put him in the world top six. The tall blond teenager has the air of a future challenger to Kasparov. He often stares out into the audi- ence when it is his turn to move, then suddenly crouches over the board and calculates with manic energy. Between moves, he strolls round the hall with a preoccupied smile. Shirov will be in Britain in December for the Foreign & Colonial Hastings congress, and it will not surprise me if he is Kasparov's opponent in the 1996 world title match.

South made a cue-bid of four diamonds, North said four hearts, and South's six spades closed an excellent auction. When West opened with the heart 10, won by dummy's ace, declarer was happy with what he saw. Six spades, one heart, two diamonds, and three clubs would give him 12 tricks. He drew trumps with king and queen, and led the club queen. West's king covered, and the ace won, but when a low club was returned, East showed out, and South had to concede two clubs. An expert declarer real- ises that clubs may break 4-1, and expert technique lands the slam. At trick two declarer ruffs a heart, draws trumps with king and ace, and ruffs another heart, and cashes king and ace of diamonds. With both the red suits eliminated, South plays his club queen, West covers, and is allowed to hold the trick. He must return a club into South's tenace, or concede a ruff discard. \"Very convenient\" you say with just the hint of a sneer, \"East may hold the four clubs.\" No problem. East must return a club, and South plays his nine. If West beats it, the suit is breaking, declarer wins with dummy's ace, and claims. E.P.C Cotter",

   "text_content" : "THE OPENING sequence of Fraudbusters goes like this. We are on the top floor of a modern office with shatter-proof windows. We hear distant theme music. The camera pans down a conference table, stopping at each pile of documents before focusing on the face behind it: first a burly young man (clearly a policeman, and black, just like in the American crime soaps), then a foxy-faced accountant, a languid lawyer, a rumpled computer boffin. Finally, we reach the head of the table. We see slim fingers riffling papers and on each finger a shapely, blood-red nail. Freeze. Actually, Fraudbusters has not been made yet. But when the TV moguls approach me I shall have no hesitation (Equity permitting) in casting Barbara Mills, QC, in the lead. Why shouldn't Nature sometimes imitate Art? Mrs Mills, director of the Serious Fraud Office, in Elm Street, London, for exactly one year, is perfect for the part. Her sandy hair is coiffed, her attitude demure and a touch schoolmistressy, her voice light and upper class. Behind a pair of enormous glasses the eyes suggest she is a humorous, jolly sort. Her occasional smile is sudden and dazzling. In the canteen below I imagine a team of investigators, fresh from a dawn raid in the City of London, referring to her with mixed rever- ence and affection as \"Her Nibs\", or \"Old eagle-eyes\". Fraudbusters would bulge with dramatic contrast between the no-nonsense public Mills and the jokey and passionate private one. Unfortunately, this is real life and the SFO director refuses point-blank - well, nearly point-blank - to talk about herself. The self-confident barrister who was Number Two for the prosecution in the first Guin- ness trial points out that she is a civil servant now, and that is the rules. But she has extra cause to.be wary. Her businessman husband, John, a Labour councillor in Cam- den, has in the past been convicted for breaches of trading standards and seen two of his companies go bust. When I asked his wife if that was not embarrassing, she snapped: \"That's an old story\". Mills has made some tough speeches about the duty of profes- sional people to blow the whistle when they suspect fraud. In conver- sation, she is careful not to point the finger. I asked her. Are you sug- gesting there are a lot more crooks in the professions these days? \"I don't say that. What I do say is that there are a number of them. It's a small number but tremen- dously damaging in my view to the professionals themselves. \"If you cannot have confidence in the honesty of a professional, that really does rock the whole founda- tion of financial trust.\" The director of the SFO is not, of course, allowed to discuss publicly cases such as the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. I men- tioned the apparent failure of audi- tors to spot holes in their clients' accounts. \"You are getting a number of cases where there seems to be a clean bill of health given by the auditors and then fairly shortly thereafter things go wrong. I don't know what the problem is, in the sense that I am not an accountant. But I am sure that sometimes the problem is that the client doesn't want to tell the auditors the whole truth. It is very difficult, then, as I understand it, for the auditors to get behind that sort of problem.\" I get the impression from your speeches that you feel the world is a bit cosy, and relations between com- panies and their auditors... \"Are a bit too close. . ?\" Yes. \"I don't know, it is thing which I have thought about and talked to a lot of accountants about, because I am cautious about treading into someone else's territory.\" What about business ethics gener- ally? I quoted the view of one banker friend that the arrival of American and other foreign finance houses, and the consequent compet- itive pressures, had undermined moral standards in the City. Can you detect evidence of that? \"I don't think I can. And I don't Christian Tyler meets Barbara Mills, scourge of the swindlers, on her first anniversary as head of the Serious Fraud Office like attributing moral decline and so on. There is always a tendency for older people to feel that the younger generation is not as good as they were. \"There have been City frauds dat- ing back to the South Sea Bubble. They come and they go. There is a slight tendency to hark back to the halcyon Golden Age when a gentle- man's word was his bond. I'm not sure that the Golden Age ever really existed.\" The apparent increase in fraud might be explained by the fact that more dubious deals were being referred to the police, she said. Again, the recession was exposing some of the investor frauds as vic- tims' funds dried up. Computer technology, while helping the fraudster, was also helping the sleuths. For example, she said, \"our people can now tell whether a disc is accidentally wiped or deliberately wiped.\" Do you think that tighter regula- tion has a perverse effect on peo- ple's attitude to financial crime - that they say to themselves If the rules don't expressly forbid it. then it's OK? \"Yes. I do get concerned if people get carried away by a rule book. I prefer the general principles approach. It sounds prissy, but it's actually a pretty good test when you're in a tight corner. Would you mind the people you work with, people who have respect for you, knowing what you've done? Forget the rule book.\" I hoped at this point that Mills would show me the woman behind the functionary. Yes, I said. But a conscience, a sense of right and wrong is something you learn as a child, is it not? \"I agree, I think a lot has to do with your upbringing.\" Were you brought up with a strong sense of right and wrong. \"I really don't know. I have always minded about things being fair and just and reasonable.\" Were you brought up in a strict... \"Not particularly. Sorry, I'm not talking about my background.\" What about your family, I read that your husband and daughter are labour councillors. Do you have political views? \"I'm sorry, I'm simply not talking about my family.\" Are you Labour too? \"Sorry, I'm not talking about it. I'm a civil servant. I'm talking to you because I do this job.\" I per- sisted and she relented a little. \"Obviously I'm interested in politics but I am not a political person. I vote, like everyone else. Fm inter- ested in the same way that I'm interested in financial affairs, in for- eign affairs. I'm prepared to talk about what it is like being a woman in a man's world, though I feel it's corny stuff, but not about my fam- ily.\" (All this was said quite pleas- antly, without the haughty air I have found in some senior women civil servants). I am going to ask you about being a woman because we're not so sophisticated in Britain yet that it ceases to be a matter of interest. You've had four children. How did you decide to have both a family and a career? \"As far as I was concerned I have always been treated as an intellec- tual equal until I left university, and it never occurred to me that I would be treated in any other way. I married very young - very happily - and I think it was never an issue that I wasn't going to do what I wanted to do, which was to be a barrister. \"What I would say is that it is quite hard physically. as well as a quite tough, demanding job men- tally. I thoroughly enjoy having the best of all worlds. So really I think I am very lucky. I spent a lot of time with the children when I wasn't working, and always at weekends. We are still a very close family.\" Why was it physically so tough? \"Because you are on the go for such a long period of time, [she had her four children in the first eight years] deprived of sleep and still having to do the best for your cli- ents the next morning. It can be quite a strain.\" It is said that women are consti- tutionally tougher than men. I asked whether they also had a dif- ferent, maybe tougher, approach to the law. Mills said she didn't think so. You have been described as more persistent than brilliant. Would you agree with that? She looked miffed. \"I never claimed to be brilliant. But I had a reasonably good academic career. I think Fm pretty practical and that's one of the t that attracted me to doing fraud. There were advantages and disad- vantages to being a women in what used to be very much a man's club, she said. \"You are noticed more, both for good and for evil. Of course Ashley Ashwood if you are no good you are noticed immediately. I don't have this sort of men-women divide. I have lived In a very male world at work for a long time, and I just do not see it that way.\" n raudbusters our heroine's see is all-Important In one scene, we hear a grizzled detective opining that Just as women make more fear- some terrorists, they also mak- more fearsome investigators. The real ills has something of that reputation. She has been more visible and accessible than her p decessor. But she rects compaint that under her the SFO enuage in \"fishing trips\", needlessly rocking the share price of quoted compa- nies, or that she is too free with the SFO's special powers to compel potential witnesses to make state- ments and produce documents. She would not agree, either, that she is more zealous than a man would be. The eagle of Elm Street was looking at the wall clock. I got up to go. \"Would you like this?\", she said, offering me a duplicate tape from the black box that had been record- ing the interview. It was a neat touch. I must include it in my TV series.",

   "text_content" : "Dominic Lawson looks at the logic behind avant garde marketing DOES advertising kill? The European Commission clearly thinks so, for it is attempting to pro- S mulgate a law which would ban all advertising and pro- motion by cigarette companies through- out the European Community. The Commission's argument is that such advertising induces people to smoke, or smoke more, and that this in turn will kill said people or a fair number of them. Naturally, cigarette companies are up in lungs over this, complain- ing of infringement of trade, free information and all other good things. Last week, I was button-holed by the head of one of these companies, a genial and shrewd man who smokes large quantities of his busi- ness's products and, I have to say, looks very wl on it. He explained to me that ti European Commis- sion's idea was a great nonsense because his advertisements, and those of his rivals, didn't actually lead to people smoking more cia- rettes. Ths surprised me, so I asked why he bothered to advertise. Because the others did, he said, and it was important for his brands to be equally in the public eye. But surely, I went on, if the European Commission has its sanctimonousr way, then he and all of his rival would be equally banished from our noardings, so none would gain an advantage, none would lose sales, and all would have hundreds of mil- lions oextra pounds to give back t shareholders in dividends. \"Oh, no\", he replied wearily, 'we'd just find worse uses for the money than advertisements.\" I sun pose by that he meant diversifica- tion into non-cigarette activities and he is probably right at that. I am sure that the cigarette boss was right in one his other para- doxica remarks: that the advotis- ing the cigarette companies push out doesn't actually make people smoke more It is a cryptic to an absurd degree, perhaps because the Advertising Standards Authority insists that it be so. Some of this, like the Silk Cut advertisements, is elegant and clever but the only vertisIng catch-phrase discernible the hardly-enticing \"cigarettes can seriously damage your nealth.\" But what motives does a com- pany like Benetton have for its equally obscure and now withdrawn campaign of giant posters of a new- born baby, complete with umbilical cord and associated gore? I wouldn't have censured the advertisement myself, just as Fm sure the ASA would not have done if the adver- tisement was for an appropriately worthy cause, such as Brtght Offence was taken not at the pic- ture itself but at the fact that it was being used for profit. We have many more financial prudes in Britain than sexual prudes. I don't believe the advertisement would have been any more success- ful at putting Benetton sweaters on people's backs than artistic ciga- rette ads make people smoke more. In the UK, advertisers specilise in such work, producing television campaigns which baffle the public, excite the pundits, win prizes at film festivals and ensure that the director's name gets well enough known for him to do what he really wants: make obscure, shocking sea- ture films in Hollywood. The advertising company knows that the managing director of the client, for all his skill at personnel management and his degrees from business schools, has no feel for what advertisement will apeal to the public. So the poor man Is imtty in the hands of the agency, which wants to make its own name rather than that of its client. It is different in the US, where pretentious attempts at avant-gard- ism never, but never, get in the way of pushing the product. There is an advertisement running on US televi- sion which shows a couple dancing around a ballroom, he with obvious discomfort. Then, a voice booms \"Do you have haemorrholds? Take X for fast relief.\" No; advertising doesn't kill. But sometimes it makes you want to curl up and die. * Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.",

   "text_content" : "S YOU WILL bear with me, I know, when I say I have lagged behind the pace this week - have found myself as far removed from the cutting edge of journalistic enter- prise and innova- tion as it is possible to be without actually signing up to write sports reports or book reviews or cookery for The Indescribablyvirtuousand- pompous. I have floated through the week. Have not been connected. Unable to concentrate. Have even stopped worrying about the price of gold. The reason for all this is that I stand at the brink of an eight-week sabbatical. Indeed, I have started it. Yesterday I flew to Athens. Then to one of the islands. Litmos or Skop gas, something like that. Somewhere plain and simple that has not been overrun by foreigners or those given to too much gaiety, where someone like me can read a book and enjoy simple food and chat with colourful peasants while the fond Aegean sun and the slow hand of time work restor- atively on the crushed and weary body, the tired and trampled psyche of a man - we'd bet- ter say it - who deserves his sabbatical. I had better tread carefully, for the wracking thought occurs to me that some of you may not receive sabbaticals - may be forced to lurch from year to year revived only by holidays in east Africa or the Alps, your careers, tumultuous though they are, taking on a grey predictability as the years roll by without benefit of something as healing and civilised as a sabbati cal. It's a nice word, isn't it? Accord ing to my dictionary, a sabbatical is \"a leave, often with pay, granted usually every 7th year (eg to a uni- versity teacher)\". Yet such is the speed of modern life, and the mag- nanimity of our employer, that I and my FT colleagues are currently entitled to a seven-week sabbatical per five years' sturdy service. Inter- rogated gently, the powers-that-be tell me that the FT's scheme is so generous that they might have to curtail it, which is why I dodged off yesterday, to Litmos or Skopgas - up with the pace, at last, if not cleverly out-running it. There was a time when FT jour- nalists setting forth on sabbatical had to have a worthwhile project lined up - an economics course at Harvard, or discovering what is was that made Legal & General tick: something weighty and uplifting, even pioneering. But these are the informal '90s. We are no longer required to have a project though some us, I am proud to say, still treat our sabbaticals with reverence and respect. There will be no high jinks for me: no gadding to the racecourse or sipping with the Dowager Lady Beaverbrook. Instead, in my r6le as a travel writer, I am using my eight weeks (sabbatical plus extra week) for a series of busman's holidays: Greece, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Estonia, and so on. Then I will write HAWKS HANDSAWS them up. Definitely \"e\" for effort. I was filling in my visa forms this week when my assistant, Miss Lee, entered the room. I explained what I was doing. \"And who will be writing Hawks & Handsaws during your protracted absence?\" she inquired. I said: \"The ubiquitous Nigel Spivey\". \"How deeply wonderful,\" said Miss Lee, blushing. \"But why ubiq- uitous?\" \"Well,\" I said, \"you've only got to pick up a telephone or open a news- paper or attend a cocktail party or go to see the opera with the ele- phants and there he is, bearing down on you - he must be 7 ft - pumping out charm and classical allusions and capping all your sto- ries - is there anywhere he hasn't been? - and generally basking in a spotlight of attention\". Miss Lee smiled obliquely. \"It is true that Nigel is amazingly enter- taining and erudite and witty and attractive to women,\" she said, \"but that is no reason for you to damn him with 'ubiquitous'. He speaks well of you. And he is right so to do. You have several qualities of which we are all fond\". \"Such as?\" \"Your nafvety, for a start. Do you know how mes- meric sheer credu- lousness can be? It is only when your ingenuousness veers into the world of fiction that your friends raise their hands and cry: 'Enough! Enough!\"' \"What do you mean?\" \"What I mean is that it was per- fectly all right to write about our cruise from Monaco to London aboard the Sea Goddess II But why did you have to go and invent that story about me running off to Copenhagen to live with Erik who was in charge of the sea-deck and brought round the bouillon? It wasn't remotely funny. It had no point. It was OTT, all my friends said so. \"Or what about Colonel Mike - this ridiculous business of pretend- ing that because you're a Kentucky Colonel your identity has been mixed up with that of an officer in US intelligence, with honorary matching rank in the KGB? God, how unfunny. \"Or what about the Hitler diaries - pretending that you had calcu- lated that the combined odds against the diaries' existence and against your finding them were 5.4bn-to-1 and, as such, perfectly acceptable to an adventurer like you?\" I said: \"I was in Wittenberg. I did drive to Dresden. The odds are approximately as I stated them\". \"Or the column in which you pre- tended to be offered the editorship of Harpers & Queen? Or where you were called to Downing Street to hear John Major's views on UFO's? How shatteringly tedious. The fact is, Michael, you need your sabbati- cal. I expect we shall be in for a memorable eight weeks\". I said: \"At least Nigel Spivey won't pretend he's a US colonel\". \"He's bright enough,\" said Miss Lee, prgtectin her cub. \"Think about it, will you? Can you imagine anything more hysteri- cal than Colonl Ngee'",
