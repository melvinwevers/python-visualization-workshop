   "text_content" : "By lan Davidson and Ivo Dawnay in Paris By Ian Dovkhmo and Iwo Damnay In Paris Landmark speech highlights rift between Britain and France MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday called on the European Com- munity to agree to full EC membership for east European nations and the Baltic states \"as soon as they are ready politically and economically\". In a landmark speech being seen as a deliberate attempt to counter arguments for rapid progress towards a close seder- ation of the Twelve, Mr Major hinted that even some Soviet republics should not be ruled out as members of a bigger EC. Mr Major argued that the Community must not adopt policies that would make it more difficult for other coun- tries to join. He told a gathering in Paris of 29 leaders of Europe's cen- tre-right political parties: \"We in the European Community cannot say: 'Here is our club, we have made the rules, and we will make new rules regard- less of your interests.\"' His comments underlined the sharp divisions on eco- nomic and political union that remain between France and Britain in the approach to the EC summit in Maastricht in December. Nevertheless, they indicated that he wants to capitalise on the momentous changes in eastern Europe to heal divi- sions within his own Conserva- tive party over the future of the EC. While advocating a broader 1iteorl oo1fmmiut .....Page 16 Community in the longer term, Mr Major appears to be clear- ing his political path at home for UK endorsement.of treaty changes that would, at least in principle, allow for closer eco- nomic and political union. In the wider sense, though, Mr Major's vision of an expan- ied Community seemed Intended to contradict the pol- icy of the French government, which puts top priority on the leeper integration of the exist- ing Twelve, before new mem- bers are admitted. On Wednesday, in a clear reference to Britain, President Francois Mitterrand restated his opposition to early enlarge- ment of the EC when he said: 'I do not want the Community to become a vague free trade irea, as certain Community countries wanted from the first lay.\" The two speeches have high- ighted deep-seated differences between Britain and France wver the Community's long-term future. By intensify- ing controversy over the choice between a wider or a deeper Community, Mr Major is, in effect, using an altruistic stance towards eastern Euro- pean to undermine the goals of European federalists. Mr Major did not envisage any immediate expansion of Community membership. \"It will take a long time,\" he said. Admission of new members, though, should be an explicit part of EC policy, including that for the Baltic states. \"In the longer run they may seek full membership. That possibil- ity should be open to them too. And we should tell them so now.\" In one of the most provoca- tive passages of his speech, he argued that it was too early, even in relation to Russia and other Soviet republics, to \"close off options\". \"It is no use saying the Com- munity would not be the same if Russia became closely associ- ated with it,\" he said. \"It might have to change, but then we do not live in an unchanging world. The Community will have to change with it.\" Mr Major's remarks were echoed by Mr Jacques Chirac, former French prime minister, and were fervently endorsed by all the eastern European dele- gations. Mr Mitterrand, though not wishing to exclude new mem- bers on principle, maintained that east European countries should in the meantime be accommodated with associa- tion agreements or member- ship of an as-yet-undefined European confederation. Mr Chirac, the domestic rival of Mr Mitterrand, fiercely * Caus ior ins eveniumu wiuaernm a move likely to annoy France Looimg ror < of European attacked the French presi- dent's views. \"It is unthinkable that we should replace the Berlin Wall by a new wall made of money.\" Throwing back the remark made earlier this year by Mr Mitterrand that it would be \"decades and decades\" before mastern European nations were ready for EC membership, Mr )hirac said: \"It would be unac- :eptable to reduce them to a )uffer zone between a rich and )rotected Twelve and a Soviet Jnion which is poor, over- Irmed and in full-blown revo- ution.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Scheherazade Daneshkhu ROVER GROUP has signed a preliminary agreement with Iran which envisages setting up car assembly plants to pro- duce the Metro, the Rover 800 and the Land Rover Discovery in the Islamic republic. Iranian estimates put the value of the 10-year accord, which includes the transfer of technology and equipment, at about Â£750m. News of the deal follows the announcement on Wednesday of a Â£45m trading loss for the first half of this year by the motor vehicle arm of British Aerospace. Rover last night said it was too early to comment in detail but it could \"confirm that there have been discussions with Iranian interests regard- ing the possibility of future business\". A spokesman for the Iranian delegation said that a letter of intent was signed in London on Wednesday night between Mr George Simpson, Rover's chief executive, and Mr Mohammad Mokhberi, presi- dent of the government-affili- ated Bonyad-e Mostazafin (Foundation for the Oppressed). Mr Mokhberi said that Rover had agreed to invest up to 35 per cent of the capital costs of production. If the deal goes through this would represent a significant boost for attempts by the Iranian president Mr Hashemi Rafsanjani to attract foreign investors. The joint venture company is to be called BonRover - an amalgamation of Bonyad and Rover - in which the Bon- yad-e Mostazafin Foundation will have the majority share- holdin. There is an acute shortage of trucks and passenger cars in Iran and the agreement is intended to supply 20 per cent of the domestic market, accord- ing to the Iranian delegation. This would take a number of years to come to fruition but Rover officials would eventu- ally supervise production in Iran. The minimum production envisaged is 30,000 units for the 10-year period. Iran has negotiated the export of 30 per cent of the production to other countries in the region, such as Pakistan. The Bonyad-e Mostazafin Foundation is headed by Mr Mohsen Raflqdust, the former minister of the Revolutionary Guards. It has come under attack periodically in Iran for failing to produce detailed sets of accounts but has recently undergone a change of man- agement and structure. A deal would indicate a return to the substantial foot- hold in car assembly that the UK held until the early 1960s through Peugeot Talbot. In 1984, its best year, Peugeot Tal- bot supplied Iran with 90,000 kit versions of the old Hillman Hunter, worth Â£130m. Peugeot, the French parent company, was awarded a FFrlObn (Â£1bn) contract by the state-owned Iran Khodrow company to produce 500,000 Peugeots over 10 years in 1989. Deliveries started last year. In July, BAe's attempts to export six of its 146 airliners was thwarted by the refusal of the US government to grant a re-export licence to BAe because the aircraft contained US-made components. Ian is subject to a US trade embargo and the State Department has said it would not consider lift- ing it until all US hostages were released from the Leba- non.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem and Lara Marlowe in Beirut A TRADE between Israel and a Palestinian guerrilla group yes- terday pushed ahead the United Nations process aimed at winning the early release of the western hostages held in Beirut. As hopes rose for a resolu- tion of the hostage affair, those close to the Beirut kidnappers said a Briton - probably Mr Jack Mann, a 77-year-old retired pilot - could be freed within days. They added that exchanges of Arab, Israeli and western hostages would be completed within two months. The latest series of moves involved the release by the Damascus-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Pal- estine of the body of Sgt Samir Assad, a Druze soldier cap- tured in 1983. The body of Sgt Assad, who was said to have been killed in an Israeli air raid on Lebanon, was flown back to Israel early today aboard a aircraft which also carried a DFLP activist who had been deported by the Israelis from the occupied West Bank five years ago. Permis- sion for the return of the deportee, Ali Abu Hilal, a resi- dent of the West Bank village of Abu Dis, had been the planned response under the UN brokered exchange process for the release of the remains of Sgt Assad. Israeli government ministers indicated yesterday that the release of 51 Lebanese prison- ers on Wednesday had been part of the carefully con- CotlBaed an Pge 18",

   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff A SHARP slowdown in average earnings growth and the unem- ployment rate confirm that the recession is coming to an end, the government said yesterday. The number of jobless in August rose by 59,200 to more than 2.4m. But, in the three months to August, the average monthly rise of 60,000 was nearly 30 per cent below that of the previous three months, said Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary. Vacancies had risen for two successive months and this week's retail sales figures showed a rise in consumer spending. In its quarterly distributive trades survey published yester- day, the Confederation of Brit- ish Industry said retailers' sales volumes were increasing, underlining tentative signals of an economic recovery. Unions and the Labour party contested the government's interpretation, focusing on the fact that the jobless figures had increased for 17 successive months and were expected to increase long after recovery got under way. Unemployment had risen by more than 750,000 in a year, which increased the danger of a \"vast pool of long-term unemployed whose prospects of future employ- ment are very bleak indeed\", said Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman. Earnings growth in June and July fell at its sharpest rate since autumn 1982. The under- lying increase in the index of average earnings across the economy was 7% per cent in July, after June's 8 per cent. The index stood 2 percentage points below its January level as rising unemployment and the fall in inflation have depressed wage settlements. The Public Finance Founda- tion, research arm of the Char- tered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, released the first monthly index of public sector pay. Pub- lic sector pay rose at an annual rate of 9.8 per cent in July, outstripping private sector lev- els by 2.9 percentage points. Manpower Services, the UK's biggest employment services company, reports in a survey of 1,500 companies that 19 per cent of employers expect to reduce staffing levels this year. Details, Page 8"

   "text_content" : "Leyla Boulton on Georgia's prospects under its idiosyncratic leader SANCTION for the break-up of the Soviet Union means that republics bent on indepen- dence are suddenly having to switch from freedom-fighting to nation-building. The turmoil in Georgia, which sees itself as next in line for recognition after the Baltics, provides a crash-course in the difficulties of making the transition. A land of wine, exuberant hospitality and maddening internal quarrels, Georgia has always been beset by its own contradictions. A Christian nation open to outside influ- ences, and a successful democ- racy for three years until it was invaded by the Red Army in 1921, it is still best known as Stalin's homeland. Today, this easy-going nation of five million people is in the clutches of a nationalist president who is building a dic- tatorial regime very similar to the communist autocracy he once fought as a dissident. President Zviad Gamsakhur- dia's Stalin-like mixture of paranoia and charm, only dis- tracts attention from the fact that this former English lec- turer makes a very bad policy- maker. \"A lack of professionalism will kill us,\" sighed Mr Tengiz Sigua, who quit as Georgia's prime minister to join the ranks of an increasingly self- confident opposition which, since last month's abortive Soviet coup, has been calling for the president's resignation. The fact that the gradual Soviet decay, culminating last month in the collapse of cen- tralised communist rule, has brought to power nationalist leaders with no previous expe- rience of politics does not nec- essarily spell disaster. Neigh- bouring Armenia for instance has found a deft and level- headed leader in Mr Levon Ter- Petrosian, a former historian. But a cocktail of new politi- cal institutions plucked from western tradition - including French-style prefectures and an overpowerful presidency - has tied Georgia's fate to the whim of one man who takes erratic decisions on everything from economic policy to nomi- nating university rectors. A lack of political maturity means that many Georgians still trust him implicitly despite the fact that his secu- rity police opened fire on pro- testers this month and that he calls all his critics liars, crimi- nals, or \"enemies of the peo- ple\". Laura, a laboratory worker in Stalin's home-town of Gori, exemplifies the blind support the president enjoys even among educated people. \"It's a lie that Gamsakhurdia is a bad man,\" she says simply. But if street rallies, the defection of his National Guard, possible student pro- tests (when the president allows the academic year to start), or parliament (when the president dares convene it) do not remove him, he may well fall under economic pressures. With shops much less well stocked than a year ago, and prices sharply up, Georgians could start voting with their stomachs this winter. Having vowed to replace the crumbling state-planned social- ist economy with a free market system, Mr Gamsakhurdia is now being accused of preserv- ing state control over the econ- omy in order to preserve his own power. According to Mr Sigua, the president is dragging his feet over land reform even though a speedy transfer of land to peasants would quickly help boost food supplies and enable a switch away from a \"colo- nial\" set-up whereby Georgia produces cash crops like tea and citrus fruit for sale to the rest of the country. Mr Gamsakhurdia denies the charges, saying that parlia- ment, which he has controlled totally until now, is \"guilty\" of not adopting land reform. The embattled Georgian leader now talks in vague and muddled terms about the need for a \"convergence\" of socialism and capitalism in a transitional period. Mr Sigua also believes that it was under pressure from the old-style mafia with links to the communist apparatus and its hand deep in the state till that Mr Gamsakhurdia dropped legislation aimed at encouraging the growth of a new entrepreneurial class. This week, in another example of an economy held hostage to politi- cal interests - Mr Gamsakhur- dia announced he would not join an economic union with other republics. \"There will be economic co-operation but no economic union because that will be a new form of the Soviet Union,\" * he said, disregarding the fact that much of Georgian indus- try is heavily dependent on the rest of the union both for industrial components and markets. Recent weeks have also seen a rekindling of ethnic passions in South Ossetia, just two hours' drive away from Tbilisi and a convenient distraction from Georgia's internal politi- cal problems. The Soviet Union is littered with inter-ethnic problems of this type, which the old central authorities had an interest in stoking up to stop republics from seceding. But following the coup attempt and the replacement of hard line secu- rity and military men in Moscow it was hoped that such issues could be discussed in a spirit of compromise. Mr Stanislav Kochiev, a South Ossetian spokesman, admitted this week that the conflict between Georgian and Ossetian nationalists had indeed been exploited by Moscow before the coup attempt.But Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has tried to suppress their attempts to break away from Georgia by violence, seems unprepared to start talks, tell- ing journalists that everything they knew about violence in Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital, was \"lies\". His opponents warn that rec- ognition of Georgian indepen- dence by western govern- ments, the one big political prize he is still seeking, could make the life of his people more difficult by removing all barriers to his rule. Mr Gam- sakhurdia replies that all pres- ent ills can be blamed on the \"transitional period\" and will end as soon as Georgia is recognised as an independent state. Paranoia and charm: President Gamsakhurdia addressing his supporters on Wednesday night"

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow TWO of the best known reformers are expected to take the top jobs in economic man- agement of the Soviet Union following the resignation of Mr Ivan Silayev. Mr Arkady Volsky, president of the Scientific Industrial League which represents Soviet state and private busi- ness, is thought likely to suc- ceed Mr Silayev, the Russian prime minister, as chairman of the Committee for the Manage- ment of the National Economy - which now acts as the Soviet government. Mr Volsky, a former Commu- nist Party Central Committee member and close ally of Presi- dent Gorbachev, is deputy chairman of the committee. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the member of the committee responsible for economic reform, is slated for the job of chairman of the Inter-Republi- can Economic Committee - the body which will oversee the common economic inter- ests of those republics which sign an agreement to be part of a new Soviet \"common mar- ket.\" Mr Silayev said he was quit- ting after a sharp disagreement with Mr Yuri Luzhkov, a fellow committee member, who accused Russia of riding rough- shod over tne interests o0 tne other republics. Mr Silayev yesterday refused explain his resignation, saying it was a matter for the State Council. Behind his decision, how- ever, lies a series of bitter dis- agreements within the Russian and Soviet leaderships - which Mr Gavril Popov, the mayor of Moscow, yesterday said was a bigger threat to future stability than \"reaction- ary forces\" still lurking in the state structures. Moscow's now substantial business community is enraged by powers granted to Mr Popov by Mr Yeltsin on August 28, which allows the Moscow mayor to freeze or cut prices, thus stopping the trend towards free prices set by enterprises themselves. Mr Konstantin Borovoi, president of the Moscow Commodity Exchange, has charged the Moscow authorities with pre. paring a decree to set ceilings on prices in the commodity exchanges, the bodies which increasingly substitute for the decaying state supply bodies. Mr Borovoi has threatened a \"business strike\" which would see the private sector transfer their operations to St Peters. burg, or other Russian cities. He has threatened to leave Moscow as \"a graveyard in which Popov and Luzhkov will govern masses of the unem- ployed\". Mr Yeltsin yesterday issued a decree taking all of the energy industries - including oil, gas and coal production - under Russian control. The move had been long adver- tised, but came as a confirma- tion of the steadily rising power of the Russian Federa- tion. Mr Yavlinsky's plan for an economic agreement is now the favourite. Other proposals are now said to be either in line with Mr Yavlinsky's, or too soft on central discipline to be serious contenders. Mr Yavlinsky has already presented a draft economic treaty to the State Council which proposes a banking and monetary union exercising tight control over budgetary and financial policies of the member states in order to curb inflation and budgetary defi- cits. He will present a further plan for co-operation with for- eign governments and interna- tional institutions offering emergency and longer-term aid to the Soviet Union at Mon-",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Kiev THE jaws of Mr Frans Andriessen and his fellow Eurocrats have dropped steadily lower in astonishment this week, as they have found economic and political disinte- gration proceeding with equal speed in current and former Soviet republics. Hours after Mr Andriessen, the EC external affairs com- missioner, was presented with an Ecu5bn (E3.5bn) to Ecu6bn request for extra food aid by Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, reports came in that the premier had resigned from the committee running the Soviet economy. Mr Andriessen is charged with finding out who is in authority in what is left of the Union. He said: \"If I have to deal with 10, 11, 12 republics, then my task is enormously more complicated.\" The EC's five-day mission to the east began in the Baltic states in an atmosphere of rela- tive mutual understanding. Once inside the rump Soviet Union, however, the EC was presented with radically differ- ent views and demands. In Moscow, Mr Silayev first gave the impression of continuity by agreeing that the EC's current food and technical aid pro- gramme of Ecul.l5bn could carry on without big changes, and then caused Eurocrats' eyes to bulge by asking Brus- sels to quintuple its aid while furnishing little detail to back the extra request. Even more worrying was the lack of will, or ability, in Moscow to stabi- lise the existing rouble. - The European Parliament yesterday urged the European Community to initiate a major international aid plan with other industrialised countries to help the Soviet Union.

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent THE prospect of an early decision to eliminate all short-range nuclear weapons deployed with Nato armies in Europe were confirmed yester- day by Mr Manfred Worner, the organisation's sec- retary-general. But he said the question remained whether Nato should scrap the weapons unilaterally or seek a formal agreement with Moscow on the lines of the 1987 INS treaty. That treaty banned US and Soviet ground-based nuclear missiles with ranges of between 500km and 5,500km. Nato leaders agreed last year to remove the allies' entire stockpile of about 1,500 nuclear artillery shells if the Soviet Union did the same. This deci- sion followed the abandonment of plans to update Nato's age- ing Lance nuclear missiles. Plans for a drastic reduction in the number of US warheads in Europe - estimated at about 3,700 including aircraft bombs - are expected to be agreed by defence ministers next month. Mr Worner said a formal decision was likely to be made at the Nato summit in Rome in November. Mr Richard Cheney, the US defence secretary, accepted last weekend that land-based nuclear weapons in Europe were now \"practically unneces- sary\". US-Soviet talks on short-range nuclear arms were due to start this year following the conclusion of the CFE treaty cutting conventional weaponry across Europe. But Nato has been divided about the desirability of pressing ahead with nuclear negotia- tions. Both the US and Britain have argued that a treaty would be difficult to verify. They are also trying to pre- serve plans for a new genera- tion of nuclear missiles carried by aircraft, as a means of maintaining a \"sub-strategic\" nuclear capability in Europe. Mark Nicholson adds from Moscow: Mr Boris Pankin, the Soviet foreign minister, said he would hold further talks today with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, on bilateral issues, including nuclear arms. Mr Pankin said he had already offered assurances that there was \"no room for con- cern about the possible decen- tralisation\" of control over Soviet nuclear forces. He added that although Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian pres- ident, had said that all nuclear weapons would be consolidated within the Russian federation, no such transfer had yet begun. Following Mr Baker's remarks on Wednesday that there now existed \"new oppor- tunities\" for negotiating fur- ther arms reductions with the Soviet Union, Mr Pankin said: \"We are naturally thinking about the possibility of acceler- ating reductions of all kinds of nuclear weapons.\" - The Soviet Union yesterday urged other members of a 118 nation pact outlawing germ warfare agents to agree on tighter safeguards, AP reports from Geneva. Mr Sergei Batsanov, Soviet chief envoy to a conference reviewing the 1972 convention, suggested adding a list of pro- hibited \"activities, devices and equipment\" to the generally- worded convention. The Soviet statement echoed a similar proposal by the Euro- pean Community. Both clash with the US view that a list would be counterproductive because no technology is in sight to distinguish between allowed research, including the drug industry, and biological weaoons work."

On September 29 foreign heads of state, including an Israeli delegation, are expected to attend a high profile com- memoration of the massacre. Mr Wiesel, who coined the term \"holocaust\", said that, although Jews in Ukraine had suffered \"terrifying moments\" over the centuries, \"Ukraine was taking positive steps to improve its relations with Jews and, like every nation, had the right to self-determination. The Ukrainian parliament also new passed a new law which establishes \"a single republican citizenship\" to replace the current system of dual republican and Soviet nationality.

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington THE SOVIET decision to withdraw troops from Cuba represents the first fruits of some quiet but intensive con- tacts between reformers in Moscow and the politically influential Cuban-American community in the US. Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, a mil- lionaire businessman said to harbour ambitions of succeed- ing President Fidel Castro in a post-communist Cuba, has been the driving force behind these contacts which began shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1989, Mr Mas Canosa helped to sponsor the first trip by Mr Boris Yeltsin to the US. At the time, many focused on Mr Yeltsin's taste for vodka and his cool reception by the Bush administration; few noticed his trip to Miami where he offered the first clear-cut pledge by a Soviet politician to cut off military aid and economic aid to the Castro regime. After the failure of the Kremlin coup, Mr Mas Canosa lost no time in arranging a trip to Moscow. For the past 11 days he has been in the Soviet capital, heading a Cuban- American delegation which has held talks with high-rank- ing officials of the Russian Republic as well as representa- tives of the central govern- ment. Mr John Cox, a spokesman for the Cuban American Foun- dation in Washington DC, said yesterday that Mr Mas Cano- sa's mission is to look for potential business opportuni- ties in the Soviet Union and to offer expertise in areas such as construction and transport. The broader aim, however, is to sound out Soviet intentions, not just on military issues but also on the more important question of trade links which President Gorbachev proposed this week to \"normalise\" by ending the barter of subsidised Soviet oil for Cuban sugar. Already, Mr Cox says, the Soviets have agreed to allow the Cuban-American Found- ation to open an office in Moscow - a stunning conces- sion since the foundation has long been an anti-communist bastion and includes former collaborators with the pre-Cas- tro Battista dictatorship. Planning for a post-Castro Cuba is well underway at the foundation. Members have drawn up an economic reform plan and a new constitution. But Ms Gillian Gunn, a Cuba expert at the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC, cautioned yesterday that Mr Mas Canosa and his friends are not neces- sarily guaranteed a one-way ticket to power if Castro falls. Other Cuban-American groups such as the Democratic Platform command support among the exile community. These groups are pressing for a \"dialogue\" with Castro and his colleagues in order to improve the chances of a peaceful tran- sition to a democracy with a functioning market economy, with no victimisation of Cas- tro's supporters. For the moment, the US gov- ernment is watching cau- tiously. Although the State Department has ordered a Rand Corporation study on Cuba, the immediate focus is on next month's party con- gress. Officials are looking for any clue that Castro or mem- bers of his inner circle are ready to take limited steps toward a market economy. Until the results of the con- gress become clear, both Wash- ington and the Cuban- Americans in Miami are inclined to keep the cham- pagne on the ice. * Mr Boris Pankin, the Soviet foreign minister, said yester- day the decision to withdraw troops from Cuba was part of a \"de-ideologisation\" of Soviet foreign policy, writes Mark Nicholson in Moscow. Mr Pan- kin said Moscow would gradu- ally reduce military aid to Cuba, which has recently aver- aged $1.5bn a year.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Graham in Rome THE Italian employers' federation, Confindustria, has warned that the economy has entered a recession and is proj- ecting growth this year will fall below 1 per cent, with inflation obstinately above 6 per cent. This is the gloomiest view vet of the Italian economy and contrasts sharply with the Andreotti government's belief that the country can avoid a formal recession. Earlier this year the government predicted GDP would grow by 2.7 per cent but subsequently revised this to 1.6 per cent. The warning of a recession comes at an awkward moment for the government, which faces conflicting economic and political pressures as it pre- pares the 1992 budget. The fragile four-party coalition, led by the Christian Democrats, is committed to exercise tighter control over state spending, tackle the country's mounting public debt and accelerate pri- vatisation. This is also the first time the budget, due to be presented by September 30, is being drawn up in consultation with the EC. The Italian authorities have been made well aware in recent weeks that without bet- ter housekeeping the country risks falling into the second division of the Community after 1992. But equally Mr Giulio And- reotti, the prime minister, faces an election in eight months. He is thus reportedly reluctant to squeeze public spending, initiate structural reforms and preside over a recession that would prejudice his Christian Democrat party at a time when Italian politics are in a state of flux. In an effort to balance these pres- sures, ministers are this week holding a series of meetings with both the employers and the trade unions. The Confindustria economic forecast contains an element of self-interest. Employers fear they will be called upon in the budget to assume a greater sis- cal burden and are therefore warning in the current climate of slim order books and high wage costs that they can bear no more. Instead, they argue, public- sector wages should be frozen, pension contributions be less onerous, government transfers to local authorities limited and a real effort be made to privat- ise. According to Confindus- tria, public-sector wages rose 9 per cent in real terms last year and remain well above infla- tion this year. However, employers are rais- ing genuine concerns, having to face a recession with high labour costs and a lire in the strait-jacket of the European monetary system. Mr Walter Mandelli, head of research at Confindustria, this week said: \"A recession after six or seven years' growth is not so unusual. But in Italy's case, the recession has hit an economy fraught with distor- tions and imbalances which have developed in the past few years and which are many times worse than those that nearly destroyed the Italian economy during the previous decade.\"",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva i SWITZERLAND'S stubbornly high inflation is a home-made problem, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its latest annual review of the Swiss economy. It says disinflation of Europe's richest economy may be more protracted and costly in terms of lost output and employment than in previous periods of inflation. The OECD warning that high wage increases for 1991 already carried a risk of refuelling price inflation, fol- lowed an announcement ear- lier this week that the biggest Swiss trade union would seek full compensation for price rises in this autumn's negotia- tions on 1992 wage levels. In the short term there is no alternative to the restrictive monetary policy of the National Bank, the OECD sec- retariat says. For the longer term it makes several recom- mendations. These include: * a revision of the mechanism which ties housing rents to mortgage rates; * reform of the federal tax system; * further dismantling of domestic cartels * a scaling back of subsidies to agriculture. By now it is generally accepted that the National Bank made a mistake by eas- ing monetary policy immedi- ately after the stock exchange crash in October 1987. Swiss consumer price inflation accel- erated from a trough of 0.6 per cent in 1986 to an average of 5.4 per cent in 1990. Last year, for the first time in more than a decade, Swiss inflation exceeded the weighted OECD average (exclu- ding Turkey) and, signifi- cantly, has been higher than inflation in Germany, the main trading partner. The latest fig- ure is an annual rate of 6 per cent in August, down from 6.6 per cent in July. Most Swiss economists expect the rate to fall to 4 per cent or lower next year but the OECD says infla- tion will still be relatively high by Swiss standards at the end of 1992. The OECD's short-term pro- jections for the Swiss economy nevertheless indicate its under- lying strengths. The slowdown is forecast to lead to a GDP increase of only 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 1992. But industrial output is expec- ted to grow 2 per cent this year and 3 per cent next; exports, benefiting from strong demand in Germany, are set to increase by 3 per cent each year while growth in imports should pick up from 2.5 per cent this year to 3.2 per cent in 1992.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent, in Frankfurt and Andrew Hill in Brussels MR Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, yester- day vigorously attacked the protectionist lobby in the Euro- pean motor industry, as a deep split re-emerged among Euro- pean car producers over the sensitive issue of Japanese car sales in Europe. He urged European car mak- ers to meet the Japanese chal- lenge head-on if they wished to remain successful in the future. His attack came in a speech at the Financial Times World Motor Industry Confer- ence. Last month's agreement between the European Com- mission and Japan to open up the EC car market completely to Japanese car imports from the end of 1999, after a transi- tion period, would confront the European motor industry with tough competition and a major challenge, he declared. But doubts about interpreta- tion of the deal have surfaced in Frankfurt in the past two days, following comments by Mr Yutaka Kume, chief execu- tive of Nissan Motor and presi- dent of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, and Mr Jacques Calvet, Peug- eot chairman. Mr Kume said on Monday Japanese makers would oppose any curb on the annual output of Japanese cars in Europe - soca\"ed \"trans- plant\" production In principle, transplants are not covered by the Japan-EC arement, and a Commission airw in Brussels yesterday reiterated no such limit had been set. But Brussels esti- mates transplant output will rise gradualy to 12m by the end it the decade. SC adals conueded when the deal ws agreed that it was a gentleman's agreement, prompting fears both sides lght attempt t reopen neg- tiations about the -assump- tos\" involved almost as oon as they had been pubished. Mr Calvet, for example, has always wanted stricte curbs on Japnse car sals during the umdiiamI period. The te of the agree t e dibeaty vage Japan wIl m laor ezpots to the EC O\"' iordonmi whb\" Imast lels of eports la UM - 1.23m based on the assumption that EC demand will total 15.1m vehicles by the end of the decade. The EC has always held there is no relation between transplant output and imports. European car makers remain deeply split on this. Mr Lind- sey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, yesterday attacked Brussels' failure to insist on reciprocity in the agreement and, implicitly, governments such as the UK which have encouraged Japanese car mak- ers to invest in Europe. The pact \"foresees a near-doubling of Japanese sales in Europe over the decade with nothing in return,\" he said. \"The EC Commission unfor- tunately did not accept the European industry's demands that increased access to the single Europe be used as a quid pro quo for easier access to Japanese markets, and Japan did not offer increased reci- procity.\" In the name of greater con- sumer choice or improved export potential, some Euro- pean governments had fought hard to help the Japanese in Europe. He urged the opening up of the Japanese car market to be the \"motor\" for car indus- try growth in the 1990s, sug- gesting a t share of 10 per cent for =r cars in Japan by the end of the decade. Mr HEastead attacked Brus- sels' failure to set any condi- tions for the local content of Japanese vehicles built in Europe. He warned \"there woud e serious consequences for Eurpean technology and the European supply base\" If the local content level of vehicles podced by the Japa- ne trn s \"continues to be beow the0 per cent evs to which Japaunse aufactur- ers have rctly ammitted\".

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "She big worry is that US recovery will be matched by a rise in Japanese exports, Robert Thomson writes OR the past few months, the Japanese govern- ment has hoped the out- side world would ignore the flow of figures suggesting that the trade surplus, supposed to be headed towards politically insignificant levels, was grow- ing embarrassingly large. \"Special factors\", such as currency and oil price fluctua- tions, were blamed for the large year-on-year surplus increases, the most recent a 68.4 per cent rise for August announced on Wednesday. While these \"special factors\" have exaggerated the increase, Tokyo now concedes that this year's surplus could be uncom- fortably close to the 1986 record of $82.7bn (Â£48.9bn) and that the figure alone could pro- voke trade friction. The biggest worry of all is that the stirrings of US recov- ery will be matched by an increase in Japanese exports. While the surplus (up 26.2 per cent to $32.3bn in the first half) has been on the rise, US criti- cism has been muted because of a fall in the bilateral surplus for four consecutive months - but, in August, the US surplus was 5.8 per cent higher than last year and the trend was turned around. That announcement coin- cided with a proposal by the infuentiui uO uemocrax, mr Richard Gephardt, for a Bill this month that would essen- tially prompt the US Adminis- tration to revive \"Super 301\" punitive action against Japan. His proposal targets countries that account for more than 15 per cent of the US trade deficit, meaning Japan, which last year accounted for about 40 per cent of the deficit. At the same time, Japan's surplus with the EC, up 60.9 per cent in August, the 10th consecutive month of increases, is fast becoming a source of friction. Apart from a rise in Japanese exports, the deflation of the country's financial \"bubble\" has led to sharp falls in imports of luxury European cars and artworks. Tokyo has brought some of the trouble on itself by classifying paintings according to the painter's nationality, regard- less of of where the painting was bought or from where it was exported. Given the Japa- nese fondness for the French Impressionists, imports from France were overstated, so the end of the art-buying spree has been accompanied by a fall in total imports from France, down 29.8 per cent in August, and by fears of trade disputes. While this year's surplus Â»<tnl mgnw ho Mnvan +n thO lam Japan's trade surplus Customs cleared ($bn) record figure, the mix of Japa- nese trade has changed signifi- cantly over the past five years. Asia has replaced the US as the most important trading region, manufactured imports have risen, and overseas pro- duction bases have increased. Yet the most serious trade \"problem\", the competitiveness of Japanese products, remains. Tokyo did all the right things post-1985, having over- seen an appreciation of the yen, stimulated domestic demand, opened up markets, and run import promotion campaigns. But the slowing of domestic growth this year and the surge in capital investment Recent measures by South Korea to cut its growing trade deficit, especially with Japan, could become a point of bilateral conten- tion, a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) offi- cial said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Last week, Seoul acted to stop domestic banks borrowing overseas for the rest of the year and to cut foreign-currency loans to South Korean companies for buying foreign-made capi- tal goods. It also moved to increase loans to companies buying locally-made machinery instead of imported goods. If the policies were specifically aimed at Japan and violated Gatt, Japan might protest, the official said, but would try to resolve differences amicably. Japan's surplus with South Korea in 1990 was roughly $5.8bn (Â£3.43bn). With Japan's bilateral surplus during the first half of 1991 reaching $4.5bn, observers think it could reach $lObn for the year. Machinery accounted for some 60 per cent of Japan's $17.5bn exports to South Korea in 1990. by Japanese industry over the past two years has given them i the means and the inclination to increase exports. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international i affairs at Ministry of Interna- I tional Trade and Industry i (Miti), listed three causes for I the fast-growing surplus this year a stronger yen, collapse of the \"bubble\" economy, and unusual demand for imports from a reunified Germany. He i concedes the \"bubble\" econ- omy, and the accompanying rush of luxury imports, exag- I gerated the the improvement in Japan's terms of trade over i the past five years. His biggest concern is that the US recovery will suck in Japanese imports, as appears to be happening, and that Washington will make his job all the more difficult. But Mr Hatakeyama believes that the improvement in the terms of trade will continue after a year or so. \"The fall of imports this year with the collapse of the financial bubble is a one-time event. This (trend) may con- tinue for one or two years,\" he said. The removal of the bub- ble, he indicated, will make clearer the structural changes in the Japanese economy, and imports will resume their rise. While Mr Hatakeyama is confident that this year will be a blip on the graph, foreign economists based in Tokyo are competing to come up with enormous figures for the Japa- nese surplus in the next year or two. Estimates of $100bn for calendar 1992 are common, and the figure for the current year is reckoned to be somewhere between $70bn and $85bn, with the \"special factors\" of oil prices and currency responsi- ble for about $20bn of that. Meanwhile, the current account surplus, which includes invisible trade, is also on the rise. It was up 136.6 per cent in the second quarter and, after falling from $87bn in 1987 to $35.7bn last year, is widely expected to be between $50bn and $60bn this year. The Gulf War prompted some Japanese to cancel planned overseas trips earlier this year, which has had the effect of increasing the current surplus, while the \"special factors\" have again exaggerated the overall rise. Special factors aside, Tokyo will be pressed in coming months by its trading partners to be seen to be acting over the very visible surplus. The large end-year figure could inspire vote-conscious US Congress representatives to suggest nothing has changed, and to seek a tougher line.",

   "text_content" : "THE European Commission will today warn EC ministers that the efficiency of the single European market could be severely hampered unless they throw their political weight behind several important mea- sures now jammed at various points in EC or national legis- lative machinery, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. The Community has already adopted all but 69 of the 282 internal market measures pro- posed, but only 17 of those measures have a reasonable chance of adoption by the end of this year, according to a commission working paper. That compares with 50 which are on the Brussels pri- ority lilt. Of the measures adopted, many have not been implemented by national gov- ernments. Among the most important measures likely to be held over until next year are the pro- posal for a European company statute, and three company law directives, including one dealing with cross-border mergers and one with take- overs. Decisions on those measures \"can be ruled out this year unless there is significant polit- ical reorientation\", says the Commission. That could delay a genuine single market until beyond the target date of Janu- ary 1993. The Commission's latest thoughts on progress towards a barrier-free European market will be put to internal market ministers at an informal meet- ing in Amsterdam today and tomorrow. Ministers will also consider what needs to be done to clear away the last frontier controls in some member states on everything from homing pigeons to walkie-talkies. \"After all the efforts that have been made to dismantle fron- tier controls, it would be beyond understanding if such controls were retained for cer- tain specific products and for certain member states,\" says the Commission in a second working paper. Perhaps the internal market measure least likely to prog- ress further this year is the proposal to allow passenger coaches to pick up customers anywhere in the Community - road transport cabotage. The Commission points out in its working paper that \"no discus- sion has taken place on this dossier for several years\", though it is in theory a priority measure. \"National markets are closed and there is little or no support for the proposal,\" says the Commission wearily.",

Dr Jonathan Mann of Harvard Univer- sity, the conference chairman, announced the new location in London yesterday at a meeting of people with HIV and Aids. Unlike European countries, the US maintains an immigration ban on people known to be HIV positive. The Bush administration has refused to lift the ban, even though most medical experts main- tain'it is unfair and unnecessary, since HIV spreads only through blood or sexual contact."

The moderate rise has encouraged the government to predict a fall in the inflation rate over the coming months, Tom Burns writes from Madrid.

Although the target of 5 per cent infla- tion at the end of this year, down on a 6.5 per cent rise in December 1990, now appears to be beyond reach, the economy ministry is confident that inflation will be below 6 per cent at the end of 1991.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Taylor in Stockholm SWEDEN appears to be heading towards a non-Social- ist parliamentary majority in the country's general election on Sunday but there are signs of a late surge in support for the ruling Social Democrats, according to the final eve-of- poll survey carried out today's Svenska Dagbladet, the leading Swedish newspaper. The survey indicates 37.7 per cent of those questioned will vote for the Social Democrats, compared with 43.2 per cent share of the vote they received in the last election three years ago. But this is a better result than in other recent surveys and it will encourage prime minister Ingvar Carlsson. However, the poll, conducted by SIFO, suggests 53.3 per cent of respondents will support one of the five non-socialist parties. The right-wing populist New Democracy seems to be fading in the polls. The other four non-socialist parties took 48 per cent between them in the poll, just enough to win a parliamentary majority. The Moderates took 21.5 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 10.9 per cent, the Cen- tre 8.4 per cent and the Chris- tian Democrats 7.2 per cent. But the outcome could hang on what happens to two other parties. The Communists - now called the Left party - will receive only 4.9 per cent of the vote, according to SIFO, and could lose their seats in parliament, while support for the Greens, at 3.6 per cent, appears to be rising slightly.",

   "text_content" : "w By Sltean Wautyl in Tokyo THE Japanese Ministry of Finance, struggling to maintain its influence following recent scandals, has blocked attempts to establish an independent financial markets watchdog on the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Ministry officials have persuaded critics that such a scheme would be impracticable and secured support for more modest reforms involving the creation of a semi-independent super- visory organisation which would be closely associated with the ministry. Its success in thwarting this serious threat to its powers indicates that its voice is also IlKiy to prevan m owner proposed reforms designed to deal with recently-publicised abuses including stockbrokers paying com- pensation to favoured clients, links between brokers and a criminal organisation, alleged stock manipula- tion and banks making illegal loans. The ministry supports some impor- tant changes - including the codifca- tion into law of many of the minis- try's instructions to financial companies. But the failure of moves to establish an independent watchdog means that the important decisions will stay firmly in the ministry's hands - even though it has itself been accused of contributing to the scandals by failures in supervision. The plan for a semi-independent watchdog is the main recommenda- tion of a report which was due to be presented today to Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister, by a top-level advisory committee headed by Mr Elji Suzuki, a leading industrialist. Some committee members origi- nally favoured the establishment of an SEC-style body, which would have taken over from the Finance Ministry powers to inspect banks and securi- ties companies. This would have left the ministry with the function of pro- moting the interests of financial con- panies - a function which critics say interferes with supervision. However, senior ministry officials persuaded Mr Suzuki and his col- leagues that an independent watch- dog would be impracticable. They said the watchdog would have to share information with the Finance Mini- try, so it could not be entirely sepa- rate. The new watchdog would be entrusted with some, but not all, of the powers of the inspection units of the ministry's securities and banking bureaux. Its position would be some- what similar to the National Tax Bureau, which is a semi-independent organisation reporting directly to the finance minister. However, staff are often transferred between the minis- try and the tax agency, so blurring the agency's sense of independence. Commenting on the report, the Asahi, a leading daily newspaper, said: \"A group of laymen failed to destroy the wall built by the bureau- crats in the Finance Ministry and the Prime Minister's office... the plan is far from the idea of a Japanese-style SEC.\""

They held two former offi- cials of the bank's branch in Akasaka, Tokyo, who alleg- edly forged certificates of deposit with a face value of Yl7bn (Â£74m) for the benefit of Marusho Kosan, a property company, which used the doc- uments as fake collateral to secure loans from finance com- panies. Mr Akira Akagi, the Marusho president, and a for- mer Marusho executive were also arrested. Fuji Bank sacked the two employees and two others when it discovered illegal loan schemes totalling Y260bn, at three branches, including Y257bn at Akasaka. However, police believe they may have schemes totalling Y700bn at the Akasaka branch alone. Similar frauds have been discovered at Tokai Bank, Kyowa Saitama and Toyo Shinkin, a small Osaka bank.

The National Democratic Front, umbrella organisation of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its military wing, challenged the country's armed forces to do the same and said it was willing to enter into negotiations on a \"compre- hensive political settlement\". However, a military spokes- man said the rebels, estimated to number some 16,000, must lay down their arms before an official ceasefire. The government of President Corazon Aquino believes a ceasefire and talks would be premature, coming after it has made substantial inroads against the rebel movement. The government yesterday abandoned the idea of a refer- endum on the US bases issue, leaving the issue up to the Sen- ate which needs to approve it by a two-thirds majority by Monday for the treaty to be ratified. Opinion polls show strong support for the Ameri- can presence. The closure of the US naval base at Subic Bay would put 45,000 Filipinos out of work.

   "text_content" : "Fed may act soon to bolster faltering US economic recovery, writes Michael Prowse N THE minds of many Wall Street analysts, the question is no longer whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again, but when. Some believe poor retail sales figures today could pro- vide a pretext for an immediate easing of monetary policy. Oth- ers expect Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to resist political pressure from the White House for a few more weeks in the hope that evi- dence of stronger economic growth will emerge. Any move by the Fed, how- ever, is likely to involve a cut in the symbolically significant discount rate, the rate at which the Fed lends reserves to banks. This is because the fed- eral funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow from each other and the benchmark for other short-term rates - cur- rently stands at 5% per cent, in line with the discount rate. If the Fed decides to ease, the most probable move would be a % point cut in the dis- count rate coupled with a % point reduction in the federal funds rate. Such easing would almost certainly trigger a % point cut in commercial banks' prime lending rates and lower rates for consumer and busi- ness loans. One small regional bank, the National Bank of Royal Oak in Michigan, yesterday cut its prime rate from 8% per cent to 8% per cent in the hope of get- ting a head start over commer- cial banks. The growing confidence that the Fed will ease again relemts a recent fading of economic optimism.

Analysts worry that the suc- cessful conclusion of the Gulf War and the drop in oil prices provided only a temporary fil- lip for the economy, reflected in strong economic reports during May and June. More recent data have been mixed, raising doubts that the econ- omy can achieve even the 3 per cent growth rate confidently forecast a few months ago. Signs that Inflation is well under control have also spurred optimism about Inter- est rate cuts. Core consumer price inflation - which excludes volatile elements such as energy and food - has fallen sharply to an annual rate of uner 4 per cent in recent months. That compares with a peak of over 5 per cent at the end of last year. Many forecasters predict inflation of only 3 per cent by the end of this year. Financial factors also point towards an easing of monetary policy. Mr Greenspan has said publicly that the Fed will pay close attention to the monetary aggregates. Yet M2, the most closely watched measure of broad money, is languishing far below the mid-point of its target range. Between April and July, it grew at an annual rate of only 08 per cent, com- pared with a target of 2% to 6% per cent. MS, a broader measure of money, has actu- ally declined in nominal terms.

Several Fed policymakers, however, are likely to urge caution. In a speech yesterday, Mr Wayne Angell, a Fed gover- nor, pointedly argued that monetary policy should not be used to manipulate the econ- omy in the short run. He said the Fed should concentrate on pursuing \"price stability\" Mr reenspan's difficult decision is likey to rest on his assessment of weakness in the real economy. Recent indica- tors have been far from uni- formly discouraging. Durable goods orders surged more than 10 per cent in July, although half the increse reflected the volatile aircraft sector. The Purchasing Managers' nde - a closely watched gauge of industrial conditions - rose solidly for the fu consecu- tive month. Industrial produc- tion has re-u about half its decline during the reces- ion. The indaex ofang idi- cators signh continelex pn-m sion, as it has done cMsisently since February. But seticsMi oat that Mot the pasom e dicators relate to the manacturig sector, which accounts for a relatively small portion of eco- nomic activity - about 20 per cent of jobs. This has been cushioned by surprisingly resilient export growth. Broader measures of eco- nomic performance, however, are less encouraging. The lat- est figures show gross national product contracting by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter - the third successive quarterly decline. Growth of personal incomes has lagged well behind con- sumption in recent months. Given high debt burdens and a low savings rate, this suggests the momentum of personal spending will slacken. Labour market data are also discouraging. Non-farm employment did expand mar- ginally in August, but the over- all increase since May has been derisory in an economy with 109m jobs. In several sectors, such as construction and state and local government, employ- ment is still contracting. And in recent weeks, claims for unemployment insurance have begun to creep higher, after falling sharply in previous months.

   "text_content" : "Stefan Wagstyl questions Yoh Kurosawa on how a leading bank lost its grip R Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, has no doubt about the enormity of the job he faces trying to rebuild IBJ's reputa- tion in the wake of the worst scandal in its history. \"It's not easy to recover a reputation which took 90 years to build. But that's my task. To recover our reputation as soon as possible and as much as pos- sible,\" he said in an interview. Mr Kurosawa has just emerged from gruelling parlia- mentary hearings. He sent his wife and daughter on a Euro- pean holiday and stayed in a hotel to avoid reporters who were besieging his home. Mr Kurosawa looked tired from investigations into why it was that IBJ, Japan's most prestigious bank, lent up to Y240bn (Â£1.05bn) to Ms Nui Onoue, a 61-year-old restaura- teur now in an Osaka jail sus- pected of procuring illegal loans to fund stock market investments. The scandal erupted a month ago when it was disclosed that Toyo Shinkin Bank, a small bank in Osaka, was on the verge of collapsing after issu- ing Y342bn in forged certifi- cates of deposit to Ms Onoue. Police say Ms Onoue, who ran up debts of Y410bn, used the faked paper as collateral for loans from other creditors. Her ties with IBJ date back Domestic wholesale prices rose by 1.5 per cent in August compared to a year ago, adding further evidence that inflation is coming under control in Japan, Ste- ven Butler reports from Tokyo. Month to month, had. whnlpsaln nrices have hardly moved since May. Prices for chemicals, plastic products, non-ferrous metals and textile goods fell in the month, while prices rose for steel products and processed food. Import prices also showed further downward uressure in the uineline. to 1987 when she invested in the bank's bonds and started borrowing using the bonds as collateral. IBJ group loans spi- ralled to a peak of Y240bn last autumn, when the bank started reducing its exposure when the stock market weak- ened. Other lenders stepped into the breach, arguing Ms Onoue's credit had to be good since she was still a client of the top-ranked IBJ. Mr Kurosawa insisted IBJ did nothing illegal, but said it had been reckless in lending so much money to one individual and careless in failing to spot the forgeries. According to Mr Kurosawa, the main reason the bank lent so much to Ms Onoue was that she held large amounts of IBJ bonds - Y140bn-worth at one point. In effect, he said, Ms Onoue was borrowing her own money. \"The Osaka branch carried out some checks but not enough... We knew in a general way that she was investing in stocks but we did not know how much.\" Mr Kurosawa argues that bank staff were carried away by the atmosphere of the late 1980s, when credit was cheap and financial markets were booming. The bank also wanted to expand from its tra- ditional base in Tokyo to Osaka, Japan's second city. The Osaka branch did ask Ms Onoue where she found the money to invest, since the two restaurants she owned could not have generated the funds she appeared to have at her disposal. \"At the time she told the Osaka branch: 'I was the hidden child of some big shot. I got the money from him.\"' \"The hidden child of a big shot\" usually means either the mistress or the illegitimate child of a rich businessman. But IBJ never established if this man existed, says Mr Kurosawa. He says he was aware of Ms Onoue as a customer from early 1989. The Osaka branch manager telephoned to say presidents of other leading banks lending to Ms Onoue had called on her. \"I am ashamed that IBJ alone has not,\" said the manager. On his next trip to Osaka, Mr Kuro- sawa spent five minutes at Ms Onoue's restaurant for tea. IBJ's contact with the forged deposit certificates did not begin until April this year, when Ms Onoue came into the branch asking for Y30bn of the IBJ bonds held as collateral saying she had to show them to her accountant. Four days later the bonds came back. In May and June the same thing happened, with Ms Onoue keeping the bonds slightly lon- ger each time. In July she made the same request. The Osaka branch was now suspicious and consulted head office. Tokyo approved the request on condition she offered some other collateral, in addition to land already mortgaged to IBJ. So Ms Onoue arrived with the Y30bn in Toyo Shinkin certificates which turned out to be forged. \"We were fooled two weeks before the bankruptcy,\" says Mr Kurosawa with a wry smile. Mr Kurosawa is still assess- ing the costs of the whole affair. By selling the collateral- ised IBJ bonds, the bank has cut its loans to Ms Onoue to just Y20bn. IBJ Leasing, a leas- ing affiliate, is owed Y40bn. IBJ has collateral worth around YlObn in the form of Ms Onoue's property, which Kurosawa: had tea leaves a group total of around Y50bn in doubtful loans. The authorities may also ask IBJ to contribute to a possible rescue of Toyo Shinkin but Mr Kurosawa insists he will inject no new money. Apart from tightening con- trols, IBJ is considering what punishments to impose on its staff. Mr Kurosawa says there is a range of sanctions includ- ing dismissal, demotion, salary cuts and reprimands. Salary cuts are the Japanese way of showing remorse. \"Even Mr [Ryutaro] Hashimoto, [the finance minister] has cut his salary 10 per cent. We may do the same. However, if we do it won't just be my salary that's cut but the whole board's.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong CANDIDATES representing business interests and calling for a closer relationship with China yesterday won the majority of 21 indirectly elected seats in the first round of elections to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The second round, for a fur- ther 18 seats - Hong Kong's first ever direct elec- tions - will be held on Sun- day. The United Democrats of Hong Kong, the pro-democracy fledgeling political party led by Mr Martin Lee, is likely to dominate the direct polls. Yesterday's elections were for 21 constituencies repre- senting business, trade and social service groups. But only nine of the seats were con- tested and turnout was lower than expected. This raised complaints from the Demo- crats that the indirect elec- tions are not representative and favour established interest groups. Mr David Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia, and Mr Stephen Cheong, a promi- nent pro-China industrialist, were among the unopposed councillors. Mr Philip Wong, the pro-China former first vice chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, was also returned unopposed. Mr Wong stepped down from the exchange earlier this year after he had admitted receiv- ing preferential allocations of shares under the chairmanship of Mr Ronald Li. But there were significant gains for pro-democracy candi- dates. The United Democrats backed two candidates, one of whom was elected unopposed. The other, Mr Cheung Man- kwong also appeared set to win the teaching constituency. Mr Cheung's election would anger China because he sup- ported the 1989 pro-democracy movement in China. Peking has issued a series of veiled warnings in the lead up to the elections that elected council- lors should seek \"good rela- tions\" with China. The elections mark the start of Hong Kong's slow shift toward democracy. According to a plan worked out by Britain and China last year, directly elected seats will increase to 20 for the next elections in 1995 and to 30 by 2007 when the remainder of the 60 seat council will all be indirectly elected.

In meetings with the justice minister this week, party lead- ers have all insisted that Mr Collor dismiss friends and rela- tives from his home state of Alagoas who work in the gov- ernment and presidency, and who are alleged to be using their positions for financial benefit. Support of the Social Demo- cratic party (PSDB) and the centre-left PMDB, the largest oppoiton party, is essential to ahive the three-fifths major- ity required for the constitu- tional reform known as the AEwmdeo to pass through Con- gress. The government insists the Emenddo is necessary for it to raise taxes and cut federal spending to avoid imposing a further economic shock pack- age and win approval for a $2bn standby facility from the International Monetary Fund. A mission from the IMF due in Brasilia on Tuesday was delayed a week to give the gov- ernment more time to gather consensus around the Emen- ddo which is now on its 14th version. On Mr Collor's return tomor- row from a visit to Africa he will have dinner with his arch- enemy Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the PMDB, who will repeat the demand for a purge of the Alagoas. Faced with a fast deteriorating economic sit- uation and inflation for this month now predicted as 19 per cent, Mr Collor may have to yield.",

   "text_content" : "By David Housego in New Delhi and George Graham in Washington INDIA yesterday won the formal support of the Interna- tional Monetary Fund for the first stage of its economic reforms when the the fund announced two loans to India totalling $2.835bn (Â£1.67bn). The board of the IMF approved a $635m loan under the IMF's compensatory financ- ing facility which is designed to make up for balance of pay- ments deficits caused by higher oil prices and lower exports. This will directly enter the foreign exchange reserves which had dropped at the end of August to a low $l.lbn - equivalent to about 24 days of imports. The borrowing is the third drawing that India has made under this facility - providing $1.8bn or almost the total cost to India up to March 1991 of the increase in oil prices due to the Gulf war. By contrast, Pakistan has so far received no such payments - in part reflecting IMF concern over its fiscal deficit and in part US displeasure at its failure to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. The IMF management yester- day also approved a $2.2bn stand-by credit which will be formally approved by the board of the fund next month. Drawings on this should begin in late October and be spread over the coming year. The two loans are the first that India has signed since the early 1980s that carry with them acceptance of an IMF programme and thus renewed monitoring of the Indian econ- omy by the fund. The \"letter of intent\" - which spells out the condi- tions India has accept- ed - commits the country to seeking a further three year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) loan. This could provide a fur- ther $5bn-Â£7bn - but will take several months to negotiate. In the letter of intent the government has pledged to reduce the budget deficit in sis- cal 1991-92 to 5 per cent from 6.5 per cent this year and 9 per cent in 1990-91. Monetary growth is to be brought down to 13 per cent this year com- pared to a current inflation rate of more than 15 per cent. The combination of these loans means that India will be one of the largest clients of the IMF in the coming years - thus giving the fund and the World Bank a deep commit- ment to the success of the Indian reform programme. Individual donor nations have remained more hesitant, however, leaving India still with a problem in financing the $9.2bn in fresh capital that it will need this financial year to cover the current account deficit and repayments on its outstanding external debt. High risk rating keeps India out of international commer- cial markets."

   "text_content" : "Richard Donkin on the mood at BCCI's offices in Abu Dhabi STHE BANK officer poured one more cup of tea and lit another ciga- rette at his desk in the Abu Dhabi headquarters of the Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional. There was nothing else to do. The last stronghold of the BCCI empire has been reduced to a few tiers of bleak, inactive, open-plan offices above the sheikhdom's main shopping centre. Every day at Sam some 500 staff report to work at the cen- tral office. Every day they leave at 1pm, then return at 4pm for a further three hours. Few are asked to do anything. \"We get the occasional request from the Touche Ross accountants working for the provisional liquidator, but mostly we do nothing,\" said the officer, who, like most of his colleagues, used to work at the former London headquar- ters of the bank in Leadenhall Street, before it moved to Abu Dhabi last year. The officer is one of the vet- erans of the meeting from which BCCI was formed. He recalled the day, September 30 1972, when some 50 executives, mainly from branches of the United Bank of Pakistan, were called together in Beirut by Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, their chief executive, for \"an important announcement\". All the travel expenses and bills at the elegant Phoenicia Hotel where the meeting took place had been paid for by United Bank. \"It was a beauti- ful time,\" said the officer, who remembered Mr Abedi announ- cing that BCCI, which had been registered in Luxembourg a few days earlier, would grow into a global banx witn ime help of Bank of America taking a third share. \"It had all been worked out, even then,\" he said. Most of the executives at the meeting were to form the nucleus of the new bank. They included Mr Swaleh Naqvi and Mr Zafar Iqbal, respectively the former and current BCCI chief execu- tives, both now being held for questioning by police in Abu Dhabi. Nearly 20 years later the executive gazed at his empty in-tray. \"I don't expect to find work in a Western bank after this. Who will employ me?\" he asked. The officer said they had been expecting an announce- ment this month that the cen- tral office would close and that 80 per cent of them would lose their jobs. Some believe a deci- sion is imminent. They say that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who, with the govern- ment and other institutions has a majority shareholding in the bank, has set a deadline of September 15 for an outline of restructuring proposals. Abu Dhabi has officially denied any such deadline, and the date seems curious, given the breathing space until December 2 allowed by the High Court in the UK for the drawing up of any serious res- cue plan. The remaining 20 per cent of the workforce expects to move to one of the other BCCI branches in Abu Dhabi or to new premises which might form a platform for a relaunch. \"The sheikh has the means to restructure the bank. He would have done so before had the Bank of England not moved against it. That hurt him badly.\" said one officer. Making plans: Sheikh Zayed, pictured this week, is said to have set a deadline for an outline of rescue proposals Â·_ Â· The surviving BCCI officers do not expect to see any of their senior management, cur- rently being detained for ques- tioning at the Abu Dhabi Police Club, return to the bank. \"It would be too humili- ating for them,\" said one of the joint executives, who had him- self been held for 24 hours after the initial police raid on the headquarters on Sunday. Detectives held some officers simply because they did not want other suspects still at their homes to be alerted. All passports of BCCI officers are being held by the local receiver for fear that some of those sus- pected of aiding any fraud might abscond. The Police Club is a large concrete building in a military zone on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. Its forbidding exterior with a high perimeter fence is designed more to keep people out than in, say locals. Behind the tall steel gates is a building run like an officers' mess, with carefully-tended lawns, fountains, and a terrace for the use of members and guests. Abu Dhabi says that the BCCI guests are being well lnlfarl Oafftrit iner anmna dnh. stance to the euphemism, \"helping police with their inquiries\". Even though Abu Dhabi has no experience of large-scale arrests of this kind, the police action appears to have been effective except for the odd case of mistaken identity. Abu Dhabi officials insist that the action had nothing to do with any other jurisdiction, although only a day lapsed before investigators in the US sparked a flurry of low-key and highly sensitive diplomatic exchanges in an attempt to secure the handing-over of Mr Naqvi, the only one of those held who has been indicted in the US on fraud charges. In the absence of a formal extradition treaty between the two countries, the US Justice Department and the office of Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, which issued the indictment against Mr Naqvi, are pursuing a joint request for an informal handover. While official Abu Dhabi sources insist that the sheikh would be unlikely to accede to the request, US sources say their initial sound- inus were more favourablv received than they expected. Given the promise by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, that the British gov- ernment would not block via- ble plans for restructuring the bank, the mild optimism in the US seemed less misplaced than it might have been a few weeks earlier. One option for the sheikh - should he consider that a prima facie case could be made against Mr Naqvi or any of his former colleagues - is that they could be charged in Abu Dhabi. Another possibility is that the detained officers may simply be allowed to leave the country after giving their ver- sion of the events surrounding the alleged fraud. The police action has paved the way for a new bank hierar- chy. Officials say that Mr Christian Hollander, the only top-tier BCCI executive in Abu Dhabi who was not held by police, will be made chief exec- utive. His role at present how- ever is still far from clear, and it may be no more than a token position since all decisions are made by the provisional liqui- dators in consultation with the local court receiver. Abu Dhabi sources are playing down the restructuring plan, but bank officers insist that there has been activity among accountants and con- sultants employed by the sheikh to examine his options. In the words of one offical \"Abu Dhabi is swarming with accountants at present.\" The restructuring plan is said by BCCI insiders to encompass a bank with a pres- ence in about 10 or 12 coun- tries across the Indian sub- continent and the Middle East. Whatever may emerge from the sheikh's investigations, bank officers are agreed that the BCCI name will be con- signed to the dustbin. \"That decision had been taken even before the Bank of England moved in,\" said one of them. Touche Ross accountants have been instructed not to talk to the press, but BCCI offi- cers who have been watching them work say they have been making heavy weather of attempts to arrive at the sinan- cial position of the bank. \"If they would let us help them a little more we could explain a lot,\" said an officer. \"BCCI is not like other banks.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent, in Frankfurt THE HEAVY truck industry in North America was \"totally out of balance\" and no companies, including the vehicle assemblers, the component makers and the dealers, were able to make a profit, Mr Sten Langenius, chief executive of Volvo Truck, the Swedish commercial vehicle maker, said yesterday. No company could today safely fund a complete product and component line within the present uncompetitive structure of the industry. \"Now the fight is to survive,\" he told the Financial Times World Motor Industry conference. Each truck maker in North America had maintained excess capacity and capacity utilisation would be down to around 55 per cent this year. CONFERENCE WORLD MOTOR INDUSTRY He said that demand in the North American truck market fluctuated \"like a roller coaster\". Between 1979 and 1984 more than 50 per cent of the market had just disappeared. \"We have seen similar drops several times; it is a real nightmare for production planners and to._ _ Â»1_ Â«> Mr Langenius warned that the industry could not secure funds for product development from sales in North America. \"It has prevented the industry from making any major technological progress during the past 15 years. Development cycles drag out. When development for environmental and safety legislation has been paid for, there is simply no money left.\" Road transport costs in the US were half the levels in Europe and the gap to Japan was even greater. \"If all this continues, the truck industry in North America will end up selling wheel-barrows,\" he said. Mr Langenius said worldwide stricter environmental legislation in combination with tougher customer demands would sharply increase product development costs, forcing a continuing restructuring of the truck industry. He called for an opening up of the Japanese truck market, where foreign truck-makers scarcely have a presence today, but said that for foreigners the long-term outlook \"is most likely positive in Japan\". Mr Junji Numata, Toyota managing director responsible for Europe, said the European motor industry needed to make a \"stepped up commitment to customer satisfaction\", it needed technological advances for the environment, fuel economy and safety, and there had to be more co-operation among vehicle-makers. Differentials among car-makers were narrowing in terms of vehicle performance and quality, and, as a result, marketing was becoming an increasingly important competitive criterion. \"Competitiveness in this market will depend more and more on building efficient dealer networks and furnishing quality after-sales service. And this is an area with a great deal of untapped potential for enhancing customer satisfaction.\" Mr Numata said he perceived \"immense potential growth in the European market\", which would grow from around 18m vehicles last year, including the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, to a 20m market by the end of the decade. German reunification would create the development of \"a huge and vigorous market in Germany\", while the creation of the single European market would \"stimulate economic vigour\". Most promising were the impending reductions and unification of taxes that applied to motor vehicles, he said. Increased co-operation among vehicle-makers was needed because challenges such as the environment, safety and traffic systems called for a response beyond the capabilities of any single auto-maker. \"We need to pool our technological resources and our financial resources.\" Ways should be studied to develop and share common components. Prof Daniel Jones of Cardiff Business School said there were great dangers and opportunities ahead in the European auto industry, but car-makers had no alternative to adopting \"lean\" production and development methods. The slowest plants and companies would not survive to the end of the decade. The leading \"lean\" car producers currently had two-toone advantages in most 'If all this continues, the truck industry in North America will end up selling wheel-barrows' aspects of car-making over traditional \"mass\" producers. The best Japanese car-makers were achieving productivity levels of 17 hours per car, compared with 25 in the US and 36 in Europe, while design and development time for a new vehicle totalled 46 months in Japan, compared with 60 in America, and 58 in Europe. Lean production no longer depended on its Japanese origins, however, and the relevant competition was now coming from lean plants within each region of the world. He said there was no general problem of over-capacity in the world vehicle industry, only a shortage of \"lean\" plants and an over-capacity of traditional mass production plants. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, Mercedes-Benz car division director, said opinions varied as to the precise figures for L*Arm aÂ«MsatÂ«M& tlÂ« Â·ruw~mAnn costs of special vehicle manufacturers in Europe are. \"There can be no doubt, however, that there is a need to shed weight. There is a clear cost gap between Mercedes-Benz, too, and the Asian producers.\" He said no one could fail to realise that new premium marques from Asia would seek and find a place in the world luxury car market. \"It is highly unlikely that the Japanese will be the only ones to hoist their flag - other nations, too, will attempt to capitalise on their chance in the top segment.\" The customers did exist, however, as it could be assumed that real income would continue to grow in the industrialised countries. The number of wealthy households, defined as having an income of $100,000 (Â£59,000) to $250,000, would increase by 70 per cent by the turn of the century. At the same time, vehicle running costs represented an ever-smaller part of disposable income, leaving more of households' vehicle budgets available for purchases. Competition would also become far tougher in the luxury car segment and the relaxed atmosphere of certain markets would give way to growing competitive pressures involving manufacturers from all continents in all market segments. It was no longer possible to overlook the warning signals. \"The annual reports in the international automobile industry have shown an average fall in profits of 57 per cent. This is ominously similar to the 50 per cent cut suffered by the profit margins of large German supply firms.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in Washington MR ROBERT GATES, the Bush Administration's nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is expected to face questions about BCCI next week when he goes before the Senate intelligence committee for hearings on his nomina- tion. Mr Frank Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska who serves as the com- mittee's vice-chairman, dis- closed that the issue would come up as he emerged yester- day from a White House strat- egy session called by President George Bush to discuss the Gates nomination. The CIA has steadfastly denied having made any illegal use of BCCI since it was revealed in July that the US intelligence agency maintained a series of accounts with the bank that were used to finance covert operations. Among these operations was the use of BCCI branches in Pakistan to finance Afhan rebel fighters, the finance minister of Pakis- tan said in July. In late 1988, when he was deputy CIA director, Mr Gates was asked for information about BCCI by Mr William von Raab, then US commissioner of customs. Mr von Raab, who was preparing at the time to announce the first BCCI drug money laundering indictments, has said that Mr Gates was \"less than candid\" because he failed to disclose the CIA's own use of the bank. A separate issue that is likely to emerge is how much the CIA knew of BCCI's alleged criminal activities. A 1986 CIA memo circulated inside the Reagan Administration included the agency's view that BCCI secretly owned First American Bankshares, the Washington bank that was chaired until last month by Mr Clark Clifford. But no action was taken by the Federal Reserve on the BCCI/First American matter until just a few months ago. PERU: Former president Mr Alan Garcia walked out of a congressional hearing, saying the panel had already con- cluded he was guilty of alle- gations that he enriched him- self while in office between 1985 and 1990. After three days of testi- mony during which he denied being linked to alleged bribe- taking from BCCI by three for- mer central bank officials, Mr Garcia protested when the panel said his lawyer would not be allowed to speak or ask questions. Mr Garcia charged that the panel, appointed by the Cham- ber of Deputies, had \"already made its decision\" about the allegations against him. He said he would appeal to the chamber for the right to have his lawyer take part in the hearings. However, several parliamen- tarians said that Mr Garcia is not being tried by the panel and therefore cannot claim that right. Mr Garcia faces accusations that he embezzled at least $500,000, evaded taxes, was cor- rupted by accepting a $9,000 cheque from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, and falsified doc- uments. UK: The staff of BCCI and its Abu Dhabi shareholders have made common cause to relaunch the bank. Ms Runi Khan, joint man- ager of BCCI's main branch in the City of London, said staff were attempting to map out proposals for a new bank which will be presented to depositors before submission to BCCI's shareholders."

How much do these contribute to Toshiba's total turnover? Aoi: Exports from Toshiba itself ac- count for about 30 per cent of our total turnover and if these are divided into our three main markets-Europe, North America and Asia-North America comes first, with Asia closely following Europe which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total. While Asia is surpass- ing the other two in terms of growth, the strategic importance of Europe is increasing. In addition to exports how- ever, local production of Toshiba subsidi- aries worldwide accounts for about 10 per cent of our total sales. iy U L Abegglen: In terms of investment, which European country is hosting the largest share of Toshiba's offshore capital investment? Aoi: In our European operations, we have focussed on three main countries: the UK, France and Germany. But in terms of accumulated capital investment, Germany tops the list. The reason for this lies in the historic development of Toshi- ba's businesses. In the UK, which is one of the first European countries where we established a production base, we have concentrated on manufacturing colour TVs in Plymouth. A new investment is now seeing the start industrial-use air-conditioner manufacturing, also in Plymouth. Focussed Investment In France, we have been expanding production facilities for copiers and their consumables in Martin-Eglise, and are also reinforcing manufacturing opera- tions at our joint venture with GEC Alsthom. In Germany, we began by investing in the field of semiconductors in Braunsch- weig and then started to manufacture VCRs in Monchengladbach and personal com- puters in Regensburg. As you will realize, the investment in plants and facilities to manufacture these products is large. Abegglern Investments such as these have not gone unnoticed by some Euro- pean governments and industry groups who complain that Japanese electronics companies want to monopolise the European electronics market. What is Toshiba's response to such allegations? Aol: Japanese electronics companies are not attempting to monopolise the European market for these products. The European market is quite large and there are many highly profitable and highly efficient manufacturers in Europe. Generally speaking, when Japanese electronics companies enter this market we make every effort to ensure that our entry does not create a surplus in supply which will lead to severe competition in the market. rm sure you'll agree that this is to everybody's benefit. In this sense, Japanese companies should aim for an orderly European market which allows all companies to develop and prosper together. Speaking specifically about Ibshiba, our policy is to 'harmonise' and not 'monopolise'. We know that there are many large and excellent companies in Europe such as Thomson in France, Philips in the Netherlands and Siemens in Germany manufacturing a wide range of consumer electronics goods, electronic machinery and components. We do not want to generate unnecessary friction with them by our entry into Europe. Of course, in order to become strong Toshiba must compete and in the process of that competition some friction will naturally arise. We should not be afraid of that but we should avoid unnecessary friction. Abegglem How is Toshiba attempting to prosper in harmony with its European competitors? Aoi: Over the years, we have formed alliances with several European manufac- turers. For example, we cooperate with Nokia in consumer products, and with Telic Alcatel in the facsimile business. Indeed, some of the TV receivers we manufacture in Europe contain picture tubes produced by Thomson and Philips. With Siemens in Germany, we have extended our technology for producing 1-megabit DRAM chips and as a result, Siemens is today one of the biggest sup- pliers of 1-megabit DRAM chips in Europe. We have also teamed up with Siemens and Harris of the US in the development of semi-customised semi- conductors. One of the issues here is the nature of the capital used to develop the European market for such products. Some believe that only European capital and European technology should be used but I do not agree. By introducing different and uni- que technologies and production pro- cedures from Japan or elsewhere, the European market will grow and all those participating in that market will grow as well. Abegglan You described the nature of your relationship with Siemens as an \"alliance'\" Why do you prefer this type of relationship and not a joint venture? Aoi: Alliances and joint ventures have their own advantages and disadvan- tages. Some Japanese companies are now less enthusiastic about forming joint ven- tures with specific partners because their experience has not been good. In Japan we have a saying: \"Sharing a bed, but dreaming different dreams\". It is difficult if two people try to steer the same ship to different destinations. The key to a joint venture is sharing a common objective. As you know, in 1990 we formed a three-way joint venture with Germany's AEG and Thomson in France called Compagnie Europ6ene Pour La Fabrica- tion D'Enceintes A Micro-Ondes, or CEFEMO, manufacturing microwave ovens which has been very successful. Output this year is expected to reach 500,000 units but this will rise to about 800,000 units by 1993. New Facilities at French Joint Venture And in March this year, we commis- sioned new processing facilitia for shap- ing, welding and painting oven body parts which will free CEFEMO from having to rely on supplies of metallic components from other companies else- where in Europe. But alliances are also useful. One of the best examples concerns semicon- ductors, where the range of functions and capacities available is so large that no single company can supply all types. Therefore, the best way for us is to share our strengths with each other as we did with Siemens. We have strengths and they have strengths and when we establish a base for technical cooperation, an alli- ance develops. Abegglen: In order to quickly estab- lish a presence in some European coun- tries, is M&A a stmtegy which Toshiba may adopt as other Japanese electronics companies have in the US? Aoi: We have been acquiring market- ing or sales companies for a long time but very few manufacturing companies. In general, Japanese companies are not enthusiastic about M&A activities. For Toshiba, we do not view a busi- ness as a product which can be simply bought and sold. When we acquire a company, that company becomes part of us and becomes part of our future growth. You must not forget that we at Toshiba have had our own experience of amalgamation. Toshiba established itself as a fully integrated electric/electronics manufacturer in 1939 when Shibaura En- gineering Works Co. and Tokyo Electric Co. merged. Even in a relatively simple amalga- mation, it is a difficult and complicated process to integrate systems of human relations. To merge a company is not as simple or easy as many people think. If we are faced with this situation, we will do whatever is necessary but we will do it in a prudent manner. Abegglen: I understand that Toshiba has recently established a new R&D fa- cility in the UK. Could you give more details? Aoi: It is often said that among Japanese companies basic research is insufficient, and we have areas in which we are strong and others where we need more study for our own sake.",

In recent years some dramatic changes have taken place in Europe such as the unification of Germany, and the ramifications of this are still being felt. At the same time, different and conflicting forces are at work in parts of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and this will influence the whole of the continent. We must monitor these developments closely. We must remember that when plans were being formulated for the unifi- cation of the EC, the member countries had no idea that two German countries would be unified as quickly as they were or that they would be unified at all, for that matter. How the countries of Europe will adjust to the emergence of a united Germany is a very important issue for the Community. Abegglent What is Toshiba's policy regarding Eastern Europe? Aoi: We have not made any invest- ments in manufacturing in Eastern Eu- rope yet. For the moment, we are content with selling equipment and maintaining the equipment we have already sold. We do not have subsidiaries in any Eastern European country although we have been involved in technical assistance projects and plant sales. We have supplied heavy electric equipment for power plants in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and helped these countries to improve their industrial infrastructure. However, this business is unlikely to expand significantly until economic conditions in these and other Eastern European countries improve. For us, it is better to cooperate with Western European companies who are undertak- ing projects in Eastern Europe. rrojessor oa sopnia universuy, IOKyo Abeggkl: Does 7bshiba adopt dif- ferent strategies for different European countries? Aol: As a general rule, it is not effi- cient to produce similar items such as TV receivers for example in every country. Producing several versions in one loca- tion is best. However, the difficulty with Europe is that for one product consumers will have different preferences.",

Abegglem In this adaptation process is the eperience of local management inporant? Aoi: It is almost essential. In the UK for example, local staff were recruited and trained to assume senior manage- ment positions from the very start of our operations and in fact our British execu- tives have melded their own management methods with Japanese ones.

These ses- sions, lasting about two weeks and gener- ally for about 20 managers from around the world, are conducted in English. In- deed, meetings with top management staff from overseas subsidiaries are all conducted in English. Abegglen: Toshiba presents the com- pany's management philosophy in terms of \"Global Corporation, Local Citizen\" Can Toshiba become a European citizen? Aoi: Our subsidiaries in Europe must become European citizens, otherwise they cannot do business. However, this is common business sense. Companies are a major element in any community and they help to create communities. Natural- ly, most employees at a plant are local citizens. This is very important: we are not seasonal workers who return to our own country once our job is done. We have to help create communities by actively par- ticipating in community activities, in the same way in which our offices and plants in Japan take part in local activities. To ensure that our employees worldwide can fully understand the company's philosophy, we produced versions of the \"Basic Commitment of the Toshiba Group\" in 11 languages. The Basic Com- mitment is a statement of our respect for the people, social mores and business practices in each region; understanding them is indispensable for successfully managing a multinational company. Abegglen: Finally, how do you see Toshiba's future in Europe? Will elec- tronics become as politically sensitive worldwide as say the automobile in- dustry? Aol: This is a very difficult question because I can see potential market growth as well as problem areas. Looking from Japan, the European market could be described as a \"mature adult\" market and we need to realise the nature of the market when identifying new products and market sectors. For ex- ample, our Toshiba lap-top computers were extremely successful in Europe. I would say that Europe \"made\" these computers for us and it was that success which encouraged us to launch them in the US just one year after they became available in Europe. The European mar- ket is large and still has tremendous room for growth, especially in electronics. However, electronics are inevitably connected with telecommunications and this is a most sensitive area because it is related to national policy. In the case of Japan, the telecommunications industry is regulated by the Ministry of Posts and elecommunications. The Japanese mar- ket is now deregulated and the former sole common carrier, Nippon Telegraph and Iblephone (NTT), has been priva- tised. But the situation in Europe is not so free, and if Japanese companies try to enter this field independently, it may cause friction. We will take this into consideration as we develop our business.

   "article_dc_title" : "Tyneside Riots Bring Warning on Flight of Capital",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Ian Hamilton Fazey, Chris Tighe and Ralph Atkins THE RIOTS on Tyneside this week could lead to a flight of capital from problem areas, Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, warned last night. Mr Tilmouth was speaking before the latest outbreak of violence in Newcastle upon Tyne last night, as a gang of 500 youths rioted in the Ben- well area of the city, setting fire to a post office and cars. Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, the main agency for economic regeneration, insisted busi- ness confidence would survive the crisis. The corporation was not going to change tack. He defended the corporation, say- ing its policies had not failed and would prove themselves in time. Mr John Major, the prime minis- ter, and Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, portrayed the riots as the action of a small number of criminals which required firm police response. Tories rejected Labour accusations that wider social prob- lems were the cause. The official view of the many bod- ies which have striven to improve and diversify Tyneside's economy was that the activities of lawless, copycat mobs would not affect inward investment or commercial activity. But Mr Tilmouth warned that dis- order had to be curbed by stiff polic- ing and sentencing. \"Capital can strike. People eventually give up and go and the problem becomes worse and worse, it becomes a self fulfill- ing prophecy.\" Northern Rock Building Society, the region's biggest financial institu- tion, was among the companies affected by the riots, with an agent's premises firebombed on Wednesday. , Mr Kevin Southwood, director and general manager said: \"Kids grow up, leave school ill educated, largely unemployable and within a couple of years they become parents themselves.\" He added: \"There are lots of initiatives, but rm not sure any are breaking the spiral.\" Mr Balls said: \"It will be impossi- ble to assess the impact of this crisis until it is some months behind us, but I believe it will prove no more than a blip in general progress.\" The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has spent about Â£120m since 1987 reclaiming more than 10 miles of derelict waterside land for a business park, industrial areas and hnunina and lWisuri dipIvlnnmantan But every site is hemmed against the river by run-down or deprived neighbourhoods, with typical unem- ployment rates of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent. Mr Balls admit- ted he was in a race between regen- eration and urban decline, but did not accept that he had lost it as a result of the riots. The riots in Newcastle have been near the riverside business park, the corporation's flagship project. Only a handful of about 800 jobs created in the park have gone to local people. Mr Balls said the claim in the cor- poration's annual report, published last week, that Tyne and Wear had 'cracked the problem\" of reconciling nvestor demand to community aspi- rations, meant the mechanism of :ommunity consultation and nvolvement to solve the problem is n place, rather than that problems lave been solved. Speaking on BBC radio yesterday, Mr Baker said the incidents were 'very much centred around car :rime\". he added: \"It is a relatively small number of people who have got to be stopped.\" Labour said the root cause had to te the social problems rampant on the housing estates con- n&nAm",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Marsh, Economics Staff RETAILERS' sales volumes are increasing, underlining tenta- tive signals that an economic recovery may have started, the Confederation of British Indus- try said yesterday. According to the CBI's latest quarterly survey of the distri- bution industry, sales volumes of shops and stores last month were higher than a year ago. Except for a freak rise in sales in March, triggered by a rush to beat an increase in value-added tax, this marks the first time since the end of 1990 that year-on-year retail vol- umes have shown a rise. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chair- man of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the increase was \"patchy\" and modest. Due to the effects of heavy price- cutting in many shops, the rise in sales volumes had not neces- sarily fed through to increased receipts. \"Although conditions are still very tight for many shops, we have become less pessimis- tic than a few months ago,\" Mr Whittaker said. He warned against expectations that a sus- tained increase in trade might be occurring and said that according to informal sound- ings September \"had not started well\" for many stores. The CBI's survey was con- ducted between August 19 and September 4. It involved responses from 505 businesses in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trade. The replies fit in with Cen- tral Statistical Office figures published earlier this week which showed two successive monthly increases in retail sales volumes. According to the survey, the sales performance of shops sell- ing confectionery, chemists' goods and clothing was better last month than in July, in both cases comparing sales vol umes with a year before. But groceries, booksellers and shoe shops suffered a poor August. Among all retailers, 41 per cent said sales volumes had increased compared with a year ago, with 30 per cent reporting a decrease. The bal- ance of 11 per cent which saw a rise in volumes was the first positive balance for this series since December 1990 - with the exception of March when there was another positive bal- ance of 11 per cent. A balance of 10 per cent of retailers expect an increase in year-on-year sales this month, compared with a balance of 2 per cent in August and 4 per cent in July. Taking all the distributive trades into account, the picture is broadly similar, with whole- salers joining the retail indus- try in expecting an improve- ment in business. Car traders, particularly affected by the recession, still expect a further deterioration. All trades reported a further reduction in staff in August, with only wholesalers saying the rate of job-shedding had slackened. Investment inten- tions have improved since the last quarterly survey in May, although traders continue to expect capital spending in the next 12 months will be lower than in the previous year. Further evidence of an eas- ing in inflationary pressures came with the finding that the annual rise in average selling prices for distributors slowed sharply in August.

Labour market data indi- cated yesterday the north, the north-west and Scotland, where the rise in unemploy- ment has been slowest, still had unemployment rates above O East Midlands 7.& 0 South West 7.P, 0 South East '74% 0 East AngHaT UNITED KINGDOM F Xi~ H K 1% the August national rate of a seasonally-adjusted 8.5 per cent. This represented a rise of 0.2 per cent from July. On an unadjusted basis, unemploy- ment rose by 67,587 to 2.4m, or 8.6 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment rose in all regions among both men and women except in Scotland, where the female unemploy- ment rate held steady. According to the Scottish Trades Union Congress the number out of work and forced to claim benefit in Scotland since last November has risen by more than 13 per cent. Mr Bill Speirs, deputy gen- eral secretary, said: \"Unless there is a big change, the last remaining Tory MPs in Scot- land will get their comeupp- ance.\" However, Mr Michael Howard, the employment sec- retary, accompanied yester- day's jobless figures with a stout defence of the govern- ment's policies. \"In the past year alone the employment service has found more than 1.5m jobs for unem- ployed people - clear proof of the effectiveness of the assis- tance being given,\" he said. He also highlighted the gov- ernment's improved industrial relations record, pointing out that the number of working days lost in the 12 months to July was the lowest for any 12-month period since the year to April 1942. The underlying trend in job- lessness was now slowing, he said. The Employment Depart- ment estimates unemployment is increasing by 60,000 a month. Officials said: \"The rate of increase peaked in March and has come down about 30 per cent since then.\" The rise in unemployment has started to exert a strong downward pressure on pay. Across the whole economy, the July underlying increase in the index of average earnings was an annual 7.5 per cent, after a revised 8 per cent in June. The rate of increase has fallen by 2.25 percentage points since the index peaked at 10.25 per cent in in July 1990. In manufacturing, the rate of increase in the index of aver- age earnings was 8 per cent in July, down from 8.25 per cent. In services the increase was down to 7.25 per cent from 7.5 per cent."

   "text_content" : "AVERAGE Britons coped with the recession by spend- ing less on food, cars and beauty products, while read- ing more books and worry- ing about health and educa- tion, Peter Marsh writes. They also drastically cut spending on furniture and carpets, while indulging modestly in jewellery and silverware, house repairs and sports goods. This picture of life in Britain in 1990, much of it spent in the deepest eco- nomic decline for a decade, emerges from the latest UK national accounts, published yesterday by the Central Sta- tistical Office. In 1990 total consumer spending - equivalent to about two-thirds of the UK's gross domestic product - rose by just 1 per cent, the smallest growth rate since 1982. Household spending on food, which accounts for just over a tenth of all consumer expenditure, fell by 1 per cent, with purchases of meat and fish both declining by 5 per cent. While sales of cos- fee, tea and cocoa were flat, spending on soft drinks fizzed ahead by 4 per cent. Leisure time was appar- ently spent reading books and indulging in sports and hobbies. Spending in these two areas increased by 8 per cent and 4 per cent respec- tively. Expenditure fell sharply on cars (down 8 per cent) and toilet and perfumery articles (down 2 per cent) while more money was spent on both health and educa- LIun, WILU CAPeBUIMuEW (151115 by 9 per cent and 8 per cent.

In the late 1980s, before the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, classes were often sent home in east and south-east London because there were insufficient teach- ers. Since then individual bor- oughs - which took over responsibility for education 17 months ago - have employed a range of incentives to attract teaching staf.

   "text_content" : "By Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent | ENGINEERING companies in the West Midlands may have seen the worst of the recession, but revival is expected to be slow, according to the latest survey of business trends in the region, published yesterday by the Engineering Employers' West Midlands Association. The West Midlands has the largest regional concentration of engineering companies in the UK and, to that extent, the survey can be seen as a barom- eter of the health of British manufacturing. Expectations of economic recovery are less sanguine than those of the gov- ernment. Dr Cedric Thomas, chief executive of the association, said: \"There is now greater sta- bility than over the last 15 months but industry is not yet on the road to recovery. Com- pared to three months ago there is little change in the utilisation of manufacturing capacity, prospects for employ- ment remain unchanged and plans for capital investment do not yet reflect any upturn in confidence.\" The survey, which covered the experience of 378 engineer- ing companies in the three months to August, showed 50 per cent of the respondents experienced a fall in orders, compared with 72 per cent in the quarter to February and 55 per cent in the quarter to May. The proportion of companies increasing deliveries rose to 21 per cent in the August quarter from, 11 per cent and 15 per cent in the two previous quar- ters. More than three-quarters of the companies in the survey expect their plant utilisation to remain the same or to increase over the next three months.. Earlier surveys by the Confed- eration of British Industry have indicated that 75 per cent of companies are working below full capacity.",

The SFO revealed the news of Mr Nadir's arrest shortly after he was remanded on bail at a London magistrates' court for a further two weeks on 18 charges of theft and false accounting originally brought in December last year. The SFO said that Mr Nadir now faces further inquiries on what it described as \"addi- tional matters\", but declined to give any details of what they might be or why Mr Nadir had been rearrested. The SFO said Mr Nadir had been questioned under caution at Holborn police station by Metropolitan Police officers attached to the SFO for 11 hours on Wednesday and released on police bail. He will be interviewed again today. Mr Nadir's lawyers last night declined to comment. Some directors unhappy with role NON-EXECUTIVE directors of public companies receive too little information to be effec- tive, according to a survey. Merton Associates, manage- ment consultants, surveyed 340 non-executive directors at 250 public limited companies. The survey found that 67 per cent of non-executive directors believed their briefings by cor- porate executives were inaccu- rate, poorly focused and badly presented. Of those surveyed, 59 per cent expressed frustra- tion, and said that corporate executives did not heed their advice. Nearly two-thirds of all non-executive directors spend fewer than three weeks a year on the affairs of the company on whose board they sit. Mr Michael Silverman, man- aging director of Merton Asso- ciates, urged the creation of part-time executive directors, who should be guaranteed access to all financial informa- tion, be given specific areas of responsibility and be required to devote a minimum amount of time each month to corpo- rate affairs.

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins CONVERGENCE among European Community mem- bers on a much broader range of economic indicators than envisaged in proposals from the Dutch presidency is required for successful mone- tary union, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, said yes- terday. Member states must also be able to sustain growth and employment without big trade deficits as well as converging on Inflation rates and ensur- ing currency stability, Mr Smith said. For the UK it would require, \"a much greater effort to establish long-term industrial strength than has been the case in the last decade\". There also had to be \"a sustained development\" of EC-wide regional policies. His speech, to a Deutsche Bank seminar in Berlin, re- emphasised Labour's belief that, while a single economic currency would bring benefits, European members states are some way off ideal conditions for monetary union. Mr Smith also expanded on Labour's proposals for devel- oping Ecofin, the council of economic and finance minis- ters, as an institution to act as a \"political counterweight\" to the new European central bank. Ecofin, whose members would be accountable to national parliaments, could be given a role in the formation of medium-term financial strategy as well as the conduct of exchange rate policy, he said. Dutch proposals for mone- tary union, discussed this week by EC finance ministers, foresaw no state entering the currency union until it had met criteria on inflation and budget deficits and had kept within narrow bands of the European exchange rate mechanism without a devalua- tion. Mr Smith, however, said his requirements on convergence could only be achieved, \"if economies have a reasonable balance in their relative com- petitiveness\". He added: \"The UK needs sustained investment in indus- trial capacity, in education and training, in research and development and innovation, and in the economic infra- structure.\" Mr Smith also warned: \"If there were growing disparities of income between its [the EC's] regions, we would encounter the heavy social costs of large scale migration.\"",

There was more than two hours of discussion yesterday between most of the 85 members of the Society of West End Theatre (Swet), represent- A-- &16-6- -- .%As~ managers,. \"This has not been the brightest week in the theatre indus- try,\" said Mr Rupert Rhymes, Swet chief executive, \"but as far as the public is concerned it [the Swet eeting ] is a peasing development.\" It also emerged yesterday that Keith Prowse owes between Â£20m and f3om to creditors, including 2pm to secured lenders. Grant Thornton, the receivers, said the remainder was owed to trade creditors such as The receivers' efforts to untangle the Keith Prowse finances are being assisted by Mr Ranit Anand, chair- man, and Mr Paul Burns, a director.

I Approximately 95 per cent of all customers who bought theatre tick- ets from Keith Prowse used credit. The receivers have promised to give all theatres a list of every credit-card purchase of their tickets through Keith Prowse. All the main bank credit-card com- panies, and American Express, a charge card, have said they would ensure that their customers were not left out of pocket by the collapse. Anyone who spent more than Â£100 is protected by the Consumer Credit Act. Midland Bank said yesterday: \"We will make sure that our customers do not lose out.\" But it said it had not yet heard about the negotiations over whether they or the theatres would bear the brunt of the losses incurred by ticket purchasers. Swet said it was not aware of any theatres which had ignored the advice it issued on Tuesday to hon- our Keith Prowse tickets, although the society's recommendations are not binding.",

   "text_content" : "I Philip Stephens reflects on Paddy Ashdown's conference call to arms I Paddy Ashdown: must persuade wavering Tories that a vote for the Liberal Democrats will not be to Labour's benefit HE best result for the Liberal Democrats at the next general elec- tion would be a Conservative victory which drove the Labour party into accepting electoral reform. However, if Mr Paddy Ash- down is to emerge from the election as the leader of a cred- ible third force then he has to win over disenchanted Tories, thereby making an outright victory for Mr John Major less rather than more likely. He must therefore persuade the electorate in places such as Cheltenham and North Devon that a vote for the Liberal Democrats would not let Mr Neil Kinnock into Downing Street by the back door; that whatever else happens, Labour simply cannot win. In effect, Mr Ashdown will be asking the voters to risk a hung parliament. He cannot admit it. If he does, the elector- ate may decide, as in 1987, that minority government is not an option worth voting for. Such are the awkward con- tradictions which face the third party in Britain's two- party electoral system. So it was hardly surprising that Mr Ashdown and his colleagues decided in Bournemouth that the best tactic was to pretend the dilemma does not exist. The disciplined sobriety of the week's proceedings could not in the end stifle entirely the speculative forays into a future beyond an inconclusive general election result. \"What will you do if..?\" is a question that will not go away, as Mr Ashdown himself was forced to acknowledge in his closing speech yesterday. But the distraction was man- ageable. The Liberal Demo- crats had enough to say - and the determination to say it - to give credence to Mr Ash- down's claim that the party was more than a spanner for the voters to throw in the Tory or Labour works. At the root of the optimism was a perception among the leadership that the ground is more fertile than ever before for constitutional change. Set against the upheavals in east- ern Europe and the march towards integration in western Europe, calls for devolution, a bill of rights and a fairer vot- ing system may strike chords with British voters. The message was that west- ern European nations have more open systems of govern- ments and their newly- liberated counterparts in the east are striving for the same. The rhetorical flourishes in Mr Ashdown's call to arms were extravagant. At times there was too much excited anticipation of the opportuni- ties he would seize in a post- Thatcherite Britain marooned in a post-Socialist world. In spite of its remarkable rebirth from the ashes of the old SDP/Liberal Alliance, the Liberal Democrats still com- mand the support of just 15 per cent of the electorate. The much-derided Mr Neil Kinnock has at worse 35 per cent and probably closer to 40 per cent. Local councillors - at times it seemed that all 3,500 of the party's coun- cillors had travelled to Bourne- mouth - gave the conference a much steadier, more sober air than many of its predecessors. But there was still the paro- chialism of a party that can claim only 22 of the 650 MPs at Westminster. Where Mr Ashdown suc- ceeded this week was in per- suading his supporters that the party's perennial demand for proportional representation - the precondition for serious success - can now be couched in unselfish terms. After the \"centralising excesses\" of three Conserva- tive governments and Labour's ragged retreat from socialism, voters might be persuaded that it was the political system not just the party in power that needed changing that Britain could not be excluded from the spirit of democratic renewal. There were Liberal Democrat policies set out alongside the political ambitions. The free- market radicalism of its eco- nomic strategy, with its emphasis on enterprise and competition, was blended with a promise to level the social playing field by spending more public money on education. An independent Bank of England would be charged with anti-inflation policy, but Mr Ashdown promised a \"relentless war\" by the govern- ment against poverty. The fun- damental aim would be to bal- ance individual freedom and self-expression with a sense of the public good, or the com- mon wealth. The delegates who left Bournemouth yesterday seemed convinced that they had at last something to sell on the doorstep during the elec- tion campaign. It must seem odd though, after a week of such promises, pledges and predictions, to reflect that the best hope of their eventual realisation lies with Mr Major's return to Downing Street.

   "text_content" : "By David Churchill. Leisure Industries Corresoondent A Â£2.4m ADVERTISING cam- paign to woo American tour- ists back to Britain will be launched in the US next year by the British Tourist Author- ity. The campaign, announced yesterday, follows a 29 per cent slump in American visitors to the UK in the first half of this year. Mr William Davis, BTA chairman, said yesterday at the launch of the BTA's annual report that he expected \"Americans to regain their enthusiasm for travel to Britain\". The campaign, which was devised by Ogilvy and Mather, the advertising agency, will emphasise the UK as the \"vacation capital of the world\". Previous campaigns have highlighted the traditions and heritage that most Americans associate with Britain. One symbol on the way out is the Beefeater which many Americans find so appealing. Mr Davis said: \"We are drop- ping Beefeaters as I don't think we need to flog that image any longer. \"We need to promote all of the UK and they are a bit short of Beefeaters in Scotland and Wales.\" The BTA also plans an advertising campaign in conti- nental Europe. The German campaign, for example, will drop the word \"pub\" from advertising as research has shown that Ger- man tourists respond better to the word inn. The BTA's willingness to change the UK's image may upset some, but it has already paid off in some mar- kets. Mr Tim Bartlett, BTA gen- eral manager for Asia and the Pacific, revealed yesterday that Beatrix Potter was a big selling point with the Japanese. \"The Japanese had never heard of the Lake District, but they seemed to know all about Peter Rabbit. So we advertised the lakes as 'Peter Rabbit's Country',\" he said. The BTA believes that the downturn in tourists to the UK in the first half of the year as a result of the Gulf war will lead to an overall drop of only 2 per cent by the end of the year on last year's record total of 18m visitors.",

   "text_content" : "By Juliet Sychrava SCOTTISH POWER, one of the two Scottish electricity companies privatised earlier this year, has won a contract to supply ICI with electricity estimated to be worth about Â£25m. The contract is for ICI's Teesside complex, which includes its Billingham, Wilton and North Tees sites. This is estimated to repre- sent approximately 1,000 giga- watt hours of electricity a year - or about as much electricity as a town the size of Luton or Dundee would consume in a year. Although Scottish Power is yet to formally announce the contract, it has been supplying the sites since August, and already supplies ICI sites at Grangemouth, Dumfries, and Ardeer. ICts Teesside sites were pre- viously supplied by Northern Electric, and represented approximately 10 per cent of the regional electricity com- pany's total unit industrial sales. After the electricity privati- sation, ICI became a member of the electricity pool or spot market, and began buying its electricity there directly. Like most contracts agreed between generators and their large customers, the Scottish Power deal is basically a financial option which protects both parties from fluctuations in the pool or spot price of electricity. However, Scottish Power will also provide ICI with a pool price forecasting service which will allow the chemical company to manage its elec- tricity use to take the best advantage of a low electricity price. \"Together these services will substantially reduce ICI's expo- sure to the pool price,\" said Mr Michael Smith, Scottish Power's marketing director, yesterday. He said that because Scot- tish Power was an integrated company which both generated and supplied electricity, it had more incentive than the regional electricity companies to court large customers. While the regional companies earn income from transporting elec- tricity over their wires system, whether or not they actually buy and sell it, Scottish Power is keen to sell the power it generates. The ICI contract will be one of the largest signed by a Scottish generator outside its own region. Scottish Power already has contracts to supply five customers in England and Wales.

   "text_content" : "By Vanessa Houlder Sn a dull, wet day, thi view of Cardiff Bal from the road abovi Penarth Haven is deeply unin pressive. Hundreds of acres o grey, slimy mudflats are sur rounded by miles of semi-dere lict banks enlivened by the od( cluster of new houses an- industrial sheds. Viewing the same scene through the eyes of the Cardil Bay Development Corporatiol is a bewildering experience. It. glossy brochures have picture of elegant quaysides, imagina tive architecture, wild flower and cheerful promenaders. The promotional materia enthusiastically describes g proposed Opera House, ax \"interactive\" science centre public art, water sports, water side cafds, and a thriving, envi ronmentally-conscious commu nity. The bay, they say, wil accommodate 6,000 houses, 9n sq ft of office and industria sites and 30,000 new jobs. The Â£2bn scheme to regener ate 2.700 acres of Cardiff'i docklands is second only to the London Docklands as Europe's largest, most ambitious and controversial urban renewal project. But the differences between Cardiff Bay and the London Docklands regeneration are probably greater than the simi- larities. The economic boom, the sweeping powers given to the London Docklands Devel- opment Corporation and the minimal planning procedures meant that the London Dock- lands' development went ahead at breakneck pace. By contrast, the Cardiff scheme is taking years to get off the ground. Even the development corpo- ration now talks about the project taking 15 to 20 years to be brought to fruition, rather than the 10 years that it was expected to take after it was established in 1987. The slowdown is partly due to the recession which has hit Cardiff, albeit later than the rest of the country. But a more serious reason for the delay has been the difficulty in get- ting the go-ahead for a barrage to create a 500-acre freshwater lake, which the corporation think would attract developers rather more than the existing mudflats. Earlier this year, a locally- sponsored private parliamen- tary bill that proposed building the barrage was talked out by its opponents. The government announced that it would intro- duce the bill itself, but the measure ran out of time and so did not have its second reading before the summer recess. Last week, the government confirmed that it intends to proceed with the bill in the autumn. Unless a general elec- tion is called, the bill will be reintroduced after the Queen's speech in November. If, how- ever, there is a change of gov- ernment, the future of the bar- rage is uncertain. The Labour party does not have an official policy on the proposals, but many of its members are vocal critics. The barrage proposals have proved intensely controversial on several counts. Leading the critics have been the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which wants to protect the mudflats as an important bird habitat. \"No other capital in Europe can boast the specta- I- -C A AMVI -.Am-i M.A VAl Cardiff Bay present and future: overlooking the bay Itsell s a model of the 2,700-acre project ing in the heart of the city,\" says Mr Ian Prestt, director- general of the RSPB. Other critics feel that the barrage's benefits are cosmetic. \"There simply must be better things to spend our public money on in regional develop- ment for more effective and less speculative job creation,\" says Mr Rhodri Morgan, the Labour MP for Cardiff West. But perhaps the greatest obstacle is the concern that the barrage could raise the water table and flood houses. The ovenumwng mer y nuun a in government has promised fur- ther studies into the effect of groundwater. Although, the development corporation admits that the uncertainty and delays affect- ing the barrage are frustrating, it puts a brave face on the prospects. \"There is no sense of depression about it,\" says a spokesman. \"Don't think that because we are waiting for leg- islation, nothing is happening. A huge amount of work has been done in terms of prepara- tion of sites and scrutinising plans.\" However, the corporation has also had to weigh up its options if the barrage does not get the green light. Some crit- ics argue that the mudflats are underrated and the absence of the barrage will not deter fur- ther investment. The corporation, on the other hand, is less certain. The question of how far developers will be attracted to the area without the barrage is one that it hopes will never have to be tested."

   "text_content" : "T he property recession ( has been a mixed bless- t ing for tenants. While c footloose tenants can gain c through falling rents and are I confronted with a wide choice a of empty buildings, many ten- ants with existing leases feel they are paying over the odds, writes Vanessa Houlder. But occupiers may have c more ammunition than they t think, according to Baker I Lorenz, the London-based sur- a veyor. It argues that tenants t would do far better to exploit ' quirks in the terms of their : lease than to rely on condi- I tions in the property market. r It goes so far as to claim that a the percentage of rent saved by its clients after negotiation I with landlords is little c changed through the peaks e and the troughs. Baker Lorenz draws atten- i tion to the restrictive user c clauses that appear in many a leases, which may bring down c the rent by as much as 70 per * cent. In a case at Chiswick, I west London, a landlord wanted a fourfold increase in i the December 1989 rent review, which would have I increased the rent to nearly I Â£16 per sq ft. Baker Lorenz advised its cli- ent to exploit the terms of the original lease, which restricted I the building to light industrial a use. Under the 1988 Town and c Country Planning Act, Indus trial premises may be used a offices but a landlord can only charge a rent relating to an Industrial use. As a result, the rent was fixed at Just Â£468 a sq ft. Another possible way of whittling down rent is to argue that environmental changes have had a detrimen- tal effect on the area. Baker Lorenz is going to test this argument itself, by claiming that the effect of the -London Transport Cross Rail link on Hanover Square, where it is based, will significantly reduce the value of properties and lower their market rental. Baker Lorenz also urges ten- ants and their advisers to look carefully at the comparable evidence in the marketplace when it comes to negotiating a rent review. In addition to considering other rent reviews, lease renewals and open market lettings, tenants can point to the trend which is likely to occur in the market place after the effective review date. The theory of a rent review is to establish the rent which a hypothetical tenant would pay to a hypothetical landlord in a 'real' open market letting. In the 91 reviews carried out by Baker Lorenz in 1990, it got a 32 per cent average saving on the landlords' asking rents."

   "text_content" : "Christopher Price examines the growing market for videophones T he prospect of having to smarten yourself up to use the telephone may not be everyone's idea of progress. But the con- cept takes a step nearer reality this December when several of Europe's telecoms operators embark on pan-European trials of videophones. Eve-2 (European Videophone Experiment) will involve up to 250 businesses in six countries and attempt to consolidate on standards, products and costs in a market that BT estimates will be worth $3bn (Â£1.7bn) a year in Europe by 1995. Optimistic telecoms compa- nies are already planning to launch commercial products within the next year. \"It is not a question of if the trials will succeed,\" says Ronald Plompen of PTT Nederland, \"but how quickly we can create the demand for the market.\" The fast pace of development has been made possible by the installation of integrated ser- vices digital networks (ISDNs), which have begun to replace traditional analogue phone cir- cuits throughout Europe. ISDN has the ability to carry a greater amount and complex- ity of signals which in turn has allowed enhanced picture and sound quality to be transmit- ted. Typically, ISDN has increased the carrying capacity of telephone lines to roughly six times their previous level. To take advantage of the ISDN quality, the telecommu- nications industry has devel- oped an enhanced codec (coder/decoder) device which sits within the videophone unit. It compresses visual images and turns them into digital signals. Thus where a normal televi- sion picture would need 140 megabits/second transmission space, the new video codec compresses it to just 64 kilo- bits/second - the carrying capacity of a single ISDN line. The effect is to reduce the potential cost of using the vid- eophone to that of a single ISDN line - in the UK the equivalent to the cost of a con- ventional phone call. The participants in Eve-2 - France Telecom, British Tele- com, Deutsche Bundespost, Norway Telecom, PTT Neder- land and SIP Italy - are all at different stages of ISDN devel- opment. In France, Eve-2 participants will involve up to 100 compa- nies. Jean-Pierre Guinen, France Telecom's representa- tive on Eve-2, says: \"There are only two problems with video- telephony - the lack of ISDN and the cost of the videophone units themselves. In France we only have the latter problem.\" In Britain and Germany ISDN already links up major business centres. Graeme Mills, BT's representative on Eve-2, says the trials will enable the operators to target specific market areas when commercial development takes off. \"Eve-2 will allow us to find out customer needs and how they react to the equipment, tariffs and network facilities.\" The types of product and ser- vices the participating compa- nies will favour will be watched anxiously by opera- tors and manufacturers. There are at least a dozen Japanese, American and European manu- facturers getting ready to launch videophones. BT has a model which incor- porates a four-inch camera set into a terminal above a 9x4- inch screen and phone. Sea- tures include a button to allow self-viewing and another to deny viewing access. Another design incorporates just the camera and screen and would fit into compatible office and home phones. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Perhaps the most exciting product development is a com- puter board which users can slot into their personal com- puters - to receive pictures on screen of TV quality while talking on the phone. A sepa- rate finger-sized camera would be sold to sit with the PC to send pictures to the caller. Other areas being eyed by BT include the launch with Evre-2 of a multi-point service which will enable any number of videophones, each using a 64 kbit/s line, to talk together. \"Videophone multipoint is a world-first,\" says Mills. \"It will allow people to see and talk to each other from any number of compatible centres.\" Cameras would be voice activated so that the person speaking would always be in view. This would be achieved by a switching unit installed on the premises with one of the phones, and in the future in BT's own exchanges. As with all new technology the initial costs will be high. BT estimates that the cost of a stand-alone videophone will be Â£5,000. \"We expect the cost of the units to fall away quite quickly as the service devel- ops,\" says Mills. The cost of a videphone should come down to around Â£300 within five years, he estimates. BT charges Â£400 to install an ISDN socket plus Â£360 a year rental, in addition to call charges. \"One of Eve-2's prime roles is to act as publicity for the new service,\" says Plompen. \"With that and the successful trial of the products and ser- vices, the market will grow and grow.\"",

   "text_content" : "Applied Materials, a lead- ing US maker of semi- conductor manufactur- ing equipment, is setting up a Japanese subsidiary in a bid to cash in on one of the most vex- ing problems facing the mak- ers of portable computers: how to raise the manufacturing yields of flat panel displays. Currently about 90 per cent of display panels that come out of the factory have to be junked because of defects. A microscopic speck of dust just 2/10 of a micron (2/10 of one millionth of a metre) is enough to short circuit the thin film transistors used for liquid crys- tal display (LCD) panels. The problem is much more severe than with silicon wafers used for semiconductors because of the large size of the panels - 1,575 square cm as opposed to 0.8 square cm. The poor yields for LCD screens have kept prices high and prevented wider use of the devices, which many experts believe will eventually replace the cathode ray tube in televi- sions in the home. The thin film transistor screens are more compact, and lighter. They consume far less electric- ity, can produce a high-quality picture and, in theory, should be less expensive to produce. Applied Materials has grown rapidly by developing equip- ment to manufacture films for semiconductors with high yield rates, and it will try to repeat this using similar technology with the much bigger flat panel displays. To date most LCD panel manufacturers have had to adapt manufacturing equip- ment designed for making solar cells, which are far more tolerant of contamination. It is a labour-intensive process in which human intervention is the inevitable source of tiny particles that find their way between the thin layers of film. \"Our ability to pursue this opportunity is the result of doing 20 years of business in Japan,\" says James Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials. Applied materials is one of the rare US survivors in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry and one- third of its $567m (Â£330m) sales last year were in Japan. Mor- gan said the decision to enter the LCD equipment business came after numerous requests from Applied Materials' Japa- nese customers and the matur- ing of technologies needed to make a success of the new manufacturing effort. He says it would be impracti- cal to develop the equipment without working closely with customers who will manufac- ture the displays. Applied Materials will design an auto- mated system to operate in a vacuum, thus eliminating human intervention. The company will employ chemical vapour deposition, plasma etching and physical vapour deposition - tech- niques for putting electronic circuitry into thin films. Applied Materials is hoping to raise the manufacturing yields for thin film transistor screens to 70 per cent by 1995. This, it believes, would help the mar- ket grow from $350m this year to $3.1bn by 1995. The production equipment market this year is estimated at $450m and can also be expec- ted to grow rapidly. Applied Materials will not be alone in the market. Its fiercest compet- itor is likely to be Anelva, a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics company NEC, which is the world's largest maker of semiconductors and claims 75 per cent of the world market for chemical vapour deposition equipment. Anelva has already started marketing specialised LCD pro- duction equipment and claims yields of 50 per cent for some types of products. Steven Butler"

These break down the paint chemically without the use of strong acids or alkallnes. By removing the paint resi- due using a centrifuge, the waste liquid can be re-used.

   "text_content" : "Bernard Simon on Northern Telecom's plans to become a global company F or the second time in a decade, Northern Telecom is girding itself up for a thrust into enormously tempting but perilously uncertain territory. The last time around, in the early 1980s, the Canadian-owned telecom- munications equipment supplier won the industry's respect by storming south of the border to become a lead- ing supplier of computerised tele- phone switches and transmission equipment to the US regional tele- phone companies. That expansion, which saw the US contribution to sales rise from less than one-third in 1978 to 64 per cent in 1984, transformed Northern from a Canadian to a North American com- pany. It set up offices and factories in the US, including a huge manufacturing complex in North Carolina. Americans started infiltrating the senior management ranks, and it switched its financial statements from Canadian to US dollars. Now, with revenues climbing above $8bn a year, Northern is aiming for the top league of the global telecom- munications business. Its Â£1.3bn acquisition of STC, the British elec- tronics group, earlier this year, new ventures in Poland and Hungary, cel- lular phone contracts in Mexico, and new factories in the Far East are among the obvious signs of broaden- ing horizons. Paul Stern, Northern's chairman and CEO, is also giving the company a vigorous internal shake-up. Franck Koelsch, partner of Transi- tion Group, an information systems consultancy which numbers Northern among its customers, says that Stern is \"really trying to generate a cultural revolution from a technology and engineering company into a market- ing company, and from a Canadian- American company into a global com- pany\". Stern, an opinionated American who took over the reins at Northern in March 1989, has not the slightest doubt that the latest foray will be enormously successful. The jury is also still out on the changes the new CEO is making inside the company. Stern (52), a physicist by training, has swept a wide broom through Northern since coming out of early semi-retirement to take control. He spent two years as a consultant to a number of US institutes and foun- dations, following a spell as the first president of Unisys, the now-troubled US computer company. The title of Stern's book on his career and management philosophy \"Straight to the Top\" gives a clue to his style. While he emphasises that the well-being of his employees is his over-riding concern, Stern also has a reputation as a hard-driving executive who knows exactly what he wants and is determined to get it. \"He rules with an iron fist and there's no question who's at the helm,\" says Koelsch. Stern has been known to walk out of an office if its occupant answers the phone while they are talking. He is also a stickler for punctuality. Stern justifies his approach by not- ing that \"wherever I've worked, my organisations have won. Most people like to be with a winner, but to win is tough. You've got to drive.\" He let it be known early on at Northern that he disapproved of the empire-building and back-stabbing which was long a notorious feature of its corporate culture. \"I have trouble understanding someone who rejoices in a colleague's failure,\" he says. Teamwork became one of the crite- ria in setting senior managers' bonuses and several layers have been cut from the management structure. Several North American factories are being closed to eliminate duplication between production in the US and Canada. A growing slice of Northern's products is likely to be sourced from outside North America, especially the Far East. Stern predicts that by further squeez- ing costs, gross margins could climb by up to five percentage points over the next few years. The new CEO has also brought in plenty of fresh blood, mostly from the US. His right-hand man, Ed Lucente, was in charge of IBM's Far East mar- keting. The new chief financial offi- cer, Martin Mand, came from Du Pont. The vice president for communi- cations, Larry Speakes, was President Ronald Reagan's press secretary. Several senior executives, including Stern, now keep two offices, one at Northern's head office in the Toronto dormitory suburb of Mississauga, the other outside Washington DC. Before Stern's arrival, Northern was organised in three main groups: Northern Telecom Canada, Northern Telecom US and Northern Telecom me a giooai company World Trade. The US and Canadian units took responsibility not only for sales in North America, but also for the bulk of the company's manufac- turing capacity. NT World Trade was essentially an international marketing arm; as a result the overseas salesforce often found itself an afterthought to North American product requirements. A restructuring put in place last February is designed, says Stern, to encourage \"truly global thinking\". Research, manufacturing and engi- neering have been taken out of the hands of regional managers. These activities are now handled by three new global product groups, each with its own president reporting to Stern. The three groups cover public net- works (cable, switching and transmis- sion), private networks (office systems), and cellular and radio prod- ucts. Northern arrived late in the cellular business, and is now working hard to catch up. The four geographic units, with responsibility for the US, Can- ada, Europe and the Far East, now stick to marketing. What was once STC is now an integral part of the European group. Now, says Stern, \"the country gen- eral manager in, say Japan, knows that although the plants in Canada and the US are far apart in miles, the people there are worrying as much about him as about the others\". He is searching for other ways to encourage managers to think beyond their national boundaries. Several teams, each comprising five senior executives, have been given specific \"globalisation\" projects. They include an examination of career development in a global context, man- ufacturing competitiveness, and the value of international staff meetings. In each case, group members have been told to find out what Northern can learn from other companies, even those in different industries. Ambitious though he is, Stern has drawn some firm boundaries on Northern's growth. He has no inten- tion, for instance, of following AT&T and numerous other telecom compa- nies into the computer industry. Northern itself burnt its fingers in data processing ventures in the early 1980s. It plans to sell its 20 per cent interest in the British computer group ICL, which was acquired as part of the STC deal. \"As long as I am at Northern Tele- Paul Stem: disapproved of empire-building and back-tabblng com, I promise we will not go into the computer business,\" he says. \"All those who have tried it before have failed. The markets are different; the politics of marketing are different.\" Northern has close links with a telephone operating company. Its con- trolling shareholder, BCE, also owns Bell Canada, the country's most pow- erful telephone utility, which has played a key role in Northern's growth by channelling many of its juiciest orders to its sister company. Bell remains Northern's biggest single customer. The two companies also share own- ership of Bell-Northern Research, Canada's biggest private sector R&D operation. But Stern insists that Northern and Bell deal with each other at arm's length and he says Northern will not acquire or willingly be acquired by a telephone operating company. \"We have a practice of not competing with our customers,\" he asserts. There are certainly some encourag- ing signs for Northern. Its sales out- side North America, which made up only 6 per cent of total revenues before the STC deal, jumped by 48 per cent in 1990. Thanks to STC's contri- bution, BT (formerly British Telecom) is now Northern's second biggest cus- tomer after Bell Canada. Northern made an important break- through this summer in the German market, one of its prime overseas tar- gets, with its first sale of an intelli- gent network to the Bundespost. Sales of corporate PBXs in France have picked up significantly. It still seems too early, however, to endorse fully Stern's sunny assessment of the future. Stern himself acknowledged when Northern published its second-quarter earnings in late July that world tele- com markets are \"extremely competi- tive\". While earnings climbed by 11.3 per cent to $106.5m in the three months to June 30, the increase was largely due to the inclusion for the first time of STC. The global strategy is likely to increase rather than lessen the com- petitive pressures. Michael Arellano, senior analyst at Northern Business Information, a New York-based research group, notes that some of the key markets being targeted by North- ern Telecom, such as Germany, have entrenched national suppliers. \"You're going to find a lot of politi- cal resistance to giving large amounts of business to foreign competitors,\" he navR",

   "text_content" : "Shmon Holberton on the failure of aualitv circles ritish managers became aware of quality when they realised that the Japanese were killing them in the market place. As logical people they asked how the Jap- anese were doing it. Some thought it had to do with the way Japanese com- panies organised shop floor work. They noticed that the Japanese had put shop floor workers together in teams called \"Quality Circles\" (QCs) and these managers decided British companies could suc- ceed if QCs were introduced. Stephen Hill, a reader in sociology at the London School of Economics, shows in a forth- coming study* that there was another group of managers who saw that responding to the Japanese challenge involved deeper thinking about organisational structure than simply adopting QCs - some- thing more radical was needed. Today this all-embracing man- agement tool is called total quality management (TQM). Hill's study seeks to find why QCs failed in Britain in the 1980s and why TQM might work. His analysis of QCs' fail- ure is still relevant today; many companies want to change themselves, but their effort is half-hearted and dis- plays a failure to think through all the issues. According to Hill, in the late 1970s and early 1980s British companies sought to solve two problems by introducing QCs: to improve employee relations; to reverse the uncompetitive- ness of British manufacturing - ambitious aims. \"It was hoped [they] would increase job satisfaction, stim- ulate personal growth, lead people to identify more with the quality of their own work and the managerial objectives of higher quality and efficiency throughout the company, and so increase employees' sense of involvement in their firms.\" His work with a number of UK companies which intro- duced QCs in the 1980s shows that, noble as those aims were, by the end of the decade they had failed to win over sceptical shop floor workers who had elected not to participate in cir- cles, and that circles encoun- tered quite vigorous opposition from middle managers. The problem, Hill says, is less one of managerial atti- tudes and culture than the inherent limitations of QCs and the way they were intro- duced. \"In essence, circles dis- rupted managers' lives for small returns and created an organisational complexity that confused existing structures; middle management had no reason to make them work.\" Hill calls this organisational complexity \"dualism\"; QCs co- existed with the company's normal bureaucratic organisa- tion and hierarchical author- ity. Thus middle managers found themselves in two struc- tures; while their position in the hierarchy allocated respon- sibility to managers for over- seeing circles it denied them authority over them. Member- ship of circles was voluntary and managers could not deter- mine who joined them; circles determined their own agenda and were not obliged to heed managers' priorities. The failure to overcome dualism and integrate QCs into their mainstream of managing was one of several reasons given by Hill's informants about the apparent lack of commitment to the programme by top managers. Others were: the absence of appraisal and rewards sanctions; and the poor calibre of circle \"facilita- tors\" - they were either too young or seen to have reached their career limit. Some of Hill's subject com- panies moved from QCs to TQM as a result of their prob- lems with QCs alone. He claims that TQM avoids the problem of dualism \"by integ- rating quality management into existing structures\". But, an appropriate design was found to be more than just the right structures, systems and procedures. \"The companies found that they had to contend with backsliding and less than full commitment among cer- tain middle and senior manag- ers.\" Hill offers the proposition that \"top management will increase the likelihood of a successful outcome to planned organisational change, in this case the cultural shift required by quality management, when it finds ways to align this with the self interest of individual managers\".

   "text_content" : "YOUNG VIC David Thacker's austere and careful production of this late Shakespeare play is rooted in the distinction between imma- turity and innocence. Trevor Eve's wild-eyed, wilder-haired Leontes is, to put it bluntly, what the honest Northerners of the Bohemian shepherdry might well call a prat. He rev- els in his jealousy, then pros- trates himself in the grief of an overgrown adolescent. This is as good a way as any of explaining the sudden, cata- strophic anger, which squalls up apparently from nothing. It is a teenager's tantrum, which might be considered innocent, if it did not go hand in fist with the power of a father and a tyrant. As if in instinctive recogni- tion of this vulnerability, his courtiers reach out to him with comforting hands, only to be smacked away. The logic of Antigonus' willingness to dis- patch the infant princess lies not, as so often, with his fear of his wife (Fiona Victory's Paulina is sensible, kind and far from domineering), but in an urge to soothe and placate. In place of a bear, he dies deaf. ened by an eery, leonine roar- ing - as if engulfed in the fantasy he has tried to serve. The innocence comes later, in sheep-shearing festivities that are gleefully led by Barrie Rutter's pied-piper of an Auto- lycus, who whisks the girls into a song and the men into a primal Morris dance, with grass masks and staves, as Sarah-Jane Fenton's graceful nymph of a Perdita rhapso- dises over her herbs and entrances Ben Miles' adoring Florizel. The accents are gently Northern, and the point is clearly made that gullibility is merely another sort of faith. Daniel Flynn's Clown, with his carrot curls and scrubbed cheeks, is not stupid but naive; his belief in Autolycus's sob story is less extraordinary, when all is said and done, than Leontes' willingness to believe that his wife's statue can be brought to life - a willingness which involves a surrender of power to Paulina, returning him to a sort of innocence. A sense of time passing Is enshrined in Sheelagh Kee- gan's superb, stark set of a sunken circle in grained wood which - with the textured lighting of Jim Simmons - can be imagined into formal clois- ters, a sundial, a rough-and-ready dance plat- form or, finally, a magic circle, in which reality can be so inverted as to allow the descending Hermione to walk up to her incredulous husband. Rudi Davies, occasionally hard to hear in the first act, has a nobility of outline and a sad dignity of bearing which keeps attention centred on her in the fifth. My one quibble is with the drabness of costuming in the Sicilian scenes, before the imagination has connected with the idiom of a production which, in Thacker's hands, sends one out the theatre won- dering why The Winter's Tale is not always performed in the round.

   "text_content" : "'Thp ninin.r Rnnm. rue de Calais'. 1915. by Vuillard. currently in Glasgow career, Edouard Vuill- s ard made a meticu- s lous study of Chardin. a As witness, the first exhibit in v the new monographic show at s Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glas- t gow, is the Chardinesque Still- i life with Hare. The larder shelf I with dead game, apples and f pitcher, and muted tonal har- I monies of soft earth colours, a are typical of the master's still- I lifes of the 1730s. Moving I through this exhibition, his i abiding affinity with the 18th r century painter becomes e increasingly obvious. Vuillard's unassuming sub- s ject matter is purposely e restricted to the familiar. Like i Chardin, he felt little need to r venture far from the sanctuary d of the domestic domain. v Although colouristically, com- e positionally and technically c daring, he was too instinctive a c naturalist to do more than flirt I with the arbitrary colour and s radically simplified form pio- c neered by Gaugin. t An exhibition devoted to a Vuillard's interiors - his most I familiar works - toured the US in 1989/90, marking the 50th i anniversary of his death. Hot on its heels came a more com- prehensive retrospective seen i in France and Spain. This lat- I est offering organised by the i South Bank Centre is the first s major public show of Vuillard c in Britain since 1948 when the t Arts Council presented a joint r show of Bonnard and Vuillard a at the Edinburgh Festival. It c focuses on the artist's early i and mid career, and on Vuill- ard as a painter of landscape as ' well as interiors. t The thematic rather than i chronological hang emphasises c the consistencies of his oeuvre. t In each of the sections oils are i shown beside lithograhs, and I works in pastel, ink and brush, I pencil, charcoal, and colle - a N glue-based distemper that a became his favourite medium. , The familiar rubs shoulders f with the unknown. s Vuillard was labelled an . \"Intimiste\" almost from the start. His canvas was the reas- suring ordinariness of home and family life. Home for him was a sequence of modest Pari- sian apartments dominated by the grave presence of his muse, his mother, with whom he lived until her death in 1928. A family meal, a quiet corner, Mme Vuillard embroidering or arranging her hair, brother Alexandre ill in bed attended by a doctor: all found their way into Vuillard's art. They are not so much his subjects, how- ever, as points of departure. \"Madame Vuillard Sewing\" seems to be a pretext for an exploration of the effect of bright sunlight penetrating a room through a wide open win- dow. With its tones of grey and warm buff, which typically exploit Vuillard's favoured cardboard ground, the interiors of the Danish painters Ham- mershoi and Holsoe seem not so very far away. The chiar- oscuro is more dramatic when the barely visible Mme Vuill- ard is painted in bed by candle- light. Home is the ultimately con- venient canvas. Within its walls Vuillard was able to work on defying pictorial space in order to bring the competing patterns of a modem \"Artistic\" interior to a highly decorative surface. Paradoxically, he also evolved a means of retaining the illusion of space. Depth in rooms or landscapes is invari- ably articulated by the angles of rugs or open doors, or where walls meet floors or ceilings. Unsurprisingly perhaps, Vuillard turned out to be some- thing of an armchair landscap- ist too. Exchanging the crowds of Paris for the country during the Universal Exhibition of 1900, he developed a taste for painting landscape. He seemed perfectly content to record what he saw from his windows at 1'Etang-la-Ville, or at the various summer retreats his friends were to take for the summer. His indolence sug- ance of motif: any room with a view - and he preferred peo- pled landscapes and gardens just as he preferred figures in his interiors - afforded intriguing enough relation- ships of form and colour. Vuillard has always been admired for the infinite sub- tlety of his colour harmonies. He could also be a sensual col- ourist. In an early work dated 1889, he builds up a picture of a family dinner in emotive acid green. Figures and faces are summarily treated, the latter harshly distorted by the shad- ows cast by the overhead lamp. The bread is directly lit, repre- sented by a succulent slash of salmon pink paint. In \"The Manicure\", a similar bravura splash of pigment unexpect- edly dazzles the manicurist's shoulder. Vuillard typically conceals the activity of the scene by choosing a viewpoint behind the client's back. Elsewhere there are thrilling juxtapositions of hot reds and russets, and the pale, chalky and matt colours of the colle sketches. Flat, muted or bold complementary tones combine with his eye for the pattern of natural effects and unusual viewpoints to make the lithe graphic suite, Landscape and Interiors, one of the artist's fin- est achievements. Vuillard's reputation has no doubt suffered because he chose to produce sensitive, dec- orative, easily accessible and perennially appealing images. This rewarding exhibition is ample proof of his humanity and enduring appeal, and that these quiet images belie a career of constant experimen- tation. Vuillanrd Intimiste de la Belle Epoque continues in Glasgow, sponsored by Whyte & Mackay, until October 20, then on to the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, October 26-December 18, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, January 9-March 8, 1992.",

   "text_content" : "SADLER'S WELLS The ideals that have inspired the creation of Moscow City Ballet are worthy. A young I ensemble, with a complement of largely youthful dancers, it offers a staple diet of the tradi- tional repertory to audiences, ever eager for such delights. That, in the process, the com- pany's artists may become fed up to the back teeth with yet 1 another Swan Lake or Giselle is, I suppose, an occupational hazard. More serious is the fact that a self-perpetuating routine is established whereby the pub- lic is led to believe that \"bal- let\" means this same round of sacred texts - a fact all too apparent in Britain, where tri- ple bills, innovative creations, are often viewed as box-office poison. The immediate problems with the Moscow City offerings are two-fold, and they were plain to see in The Sleeping Beauty which opened the troupe's London season. Visu- ally the staging is pauper-ish, as haplessly flimsy and impro- visatory as amateur theatri- cals. The chasm between Soviet and Western theatre design was never harder to cross than when viewing the gold and lace knickerbocker suit worn by the King, or the tinsel gleam of sketchy scenery that served obstinately for each act. On Tuesday night these infe- licities framed mimed perfor- mances as mechanical and unlikely as any I have seen. No dancer finished a variation but the gaggle of watching court- iers gestured dainty nothings to each other. No artist, save Lyudmila Semenyaka, the guest Aurora, conveyed belief in the dignity and power of the choreography - and certain variants in the text (notably the scamperings by the Fairy cavaliers) were not to be excused by the crowded cir- cumstances of the Wells stage, onto which Beauty fits as into a strait-jacket. We do not expect Kirov or Bolshoy authority in such a presentation, but Beauty is not to be so diminished in effects as to seem a parody of itself, and this the design and uncertain performance mannei achieved. Because ol Semenyaka, the central truth of the ballet was, however, clear to see. She is an ideal Aurora, by training, artistic inheritance, temperament and physical gifts. Petipa's harmonies are reflected in a no less harmonious placing of her body. Lightness and clarity of style, ravishing modulations of contraposto, give savour and meaning to pose and step. Her dance intelligence traces Aurora's story through richly varied technical nuance, from the tender Princess of the first act to the serenely joyful bride of the last adagio, by way of the flawless academicism of the vision scene. It is classical dancing of the rarest distinction. About the rest of the performance I record with pleasure that Natalya Yakovleva was an impressive and dignified Lilac Fairy, that the corps de ballet of dryads were disciplined and pleasing, and that under Alexander Vedernikov the score was honourably treated.",

   "text_content" : "COLISEUM Sixteen further performances of English National Opera's revival of its 1977 Bohfme are scheduled into November, with major cast changes promised at the midway point. The revival is clearly an important box-office factor in the com- pany's autumn plans, and per- haps one could have expected more care and energy in its presentation than was obvious at Wednesday's opening. Jean-Claude Auvray's stag- ing was always plain and unex- ceptional despite Monloup's finicky sets, but in the past it could be energised by vigorous acting and decent, attentive singing. This time it has been re-rehearsed by Julia Hol- lander, and given a new light- ing plot by Paul Taylor, but it is hard to determine just what the new team has added. There was nothing on stage that could not have been devised unaided by the native wit of an experienced cast, except per- haps the portrayal of some of the extras, the guard at the Barribre d'Enfer most of all, as refugees from a long-lost pro- aucuon o01 ouse oj me ueaa. Yet the lethargy was just a, much musical as dramatic. Thi conductor is Guido Ajmone Marsan, making his ENC debut by plodding through th< score with little or purpose tC his phrasing, and eact dynamic at least one notch to( high. With more encourage ment from the pit Vivian Tier ney's Mimi might have thrived even if she looks too whole some and, it has to be said, to( robustly English much of th< time. Her performance came tC life just as she died: the fina phrases were beautifuill placed in a spell-binding mezt voce. Her Rudolph is anothei newcomer to the Coliseum Joseph Evans, who though hi looks plausible enough is stiff unconvincing and consistentl3 harsh toned. In normal circumstances Lesley Garrett's wilfully over the-top Musetta would havi been all too much; here it cami as a blessed injection of vital ity into the second act, an( Alan Opie's clear-thinking sav him through a perfectly decen ; Joseph Evans and r Vivian Tierney Marcel. The remainder of the Bohemians seem more or less r competent, while Eric Shil- ling's cameos as Benoit and i Alcindoro were so indistin- guishable I thought for a moment the production had come up with a new textual - twist.

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALBERT HALL. RADIO 3 If, as the BBC man announced, v the Albert Hall was \"packed\" c for Wednesday's Prom concert, I the reason was surely not so e much the all-Mozart pro- I gramme as Mitsuko Uchida's c participation in it. She played t the D minor piano concerto, K. 466, with gleaming purpose and huge dramatic flair. Conducted by George Cleve, the English Chamber Orchestra, kept up nicely, as far as one could tell - the BBC microphones, I understandably, favoured the d piano. I Later the mezzo sang two e Mozart concert arias with her c usual limpid integrity, and a @ merry third one in brittle sou- t brette tones. On the operatic 1 stage Miss Murray can be a I charming comedienne, but by itself the voice never betrays a I natural twinkle. After the arias f came the \"Jupiter\" Symphony, J where Cleve took a strongly I up-tempo view of the outer t movements; the experiment r just about came off, though his s players sounded more hustled I than convinced. i The novelty of the evening I had come first, the American I Robert Levin's \"reconstruc- ; tion\" of the Sinfonia Concert- I ante with four solo winds, K. t 297B. The version that has t come down to us, with oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn, has s long been known to be inauth- s entic; not only did the original r quartet include flute, rather s than clarinet, but the orches- r tral material is somebody else's c dubious work. t I began listening with the I standard Eulenburg score in e hand, but it became clear at once that that exercise was pointless. Levin has jettisoned f the old orchestral score alto- e gether, and \"reconstructed\" 1 the little concerto - considera- 1 bly shorter now - from the c solo parts alone. And those I have been radically redistrib- c uted among the players: there I could never have been any I question of simply re-assigning the \"clarinet\" part to the flute, I but Levin has gone much fur- c ther. The players take turns ; with phrases that used to stay i on a single instrument, and I some of the reassignments demand unexpected virtuosity. i It was fascinating to hear. t There were places where the i flute, as the new leader, nmindar aliuihtlv inainid where we're used to an oboe - and can Mozart really have had a horn-player capable of these extravagant new flights? (Here, Frank Lloyd certainly was: he even threw in a higher major third at the top of one.) It will all take getting used to, but it was eminently worth doing. David Murray In the last years before his death Leonard Bernstein became enamoured of the audi- ences at the Promenade con- certs and last night's pro- gramme was planned as a tribute to him by the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he had been President. The evening opened with a pair of works by Stravinsky, familiar Bernstein territory. To judge from these performances Michael Tilson Thomas enjoys the physical energy of the music just as much as Bern- stein did, which suggests a peculiarly American delight in its driving rhythms. Both the Symphony in C and the Sym- phony of Psalms went with plenty of energy, although the latter held off any overt emo- tion in the Bernstein manner until the final chords. After the interval Bern- stein's own music took the stage. The LSO always shines most brightly in 20th-century showpieces, which may be one reason why Bernstein enjoyed conducting the orchestra, and the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story gave the play- ers plenty of opportunity to show off. In a clever balance with the first half, the programme then ended with the Chichester Psalms. Where Stravinsky set his psalms in a spirit of neo- classical severity, Bernstein preferred a colourful mixture of styles and creeds, of showbiz garishness and Anglican purity. By the end the piece has become too sentimental for its own good, but the London Symphony Chorus came across well in it and Tilson Thomas himself is obviously convinced. The performance augured well for the LSO's extended tribute to Bernstein at the Bar- bican later in the year. Richard Fairman",

   "text_content" : "THE COLLAPSE of communism in the Soviet Union, entailing as it does the virtual disappearance of the Soviet Union as such, was rightly described by the British prime minister yesterday as one of the most dramatic revo- lutions of the 20th century. Coming on top of the with- drawal of Soviet power from east-central Europe, it trans- forms the environment in which the European Commu- nity has evolved. That does not mean that the EC's evolution should be arrested, still less reversed. It does mean that it has to rethink its priorities very carefully in the light of the new circumstances. Today, in the first of an occa- sional series of leading articles analysing the implications of this change, we consider how far the EC should aspire to expand into the vacuum left to its east by the rout of commu- nist power and the dismantling of the communist economic system. Further articles will discuss the institutional struc- ture required by this expan- sion, the extent to which the EC should involve itself in questions of defence and secu- rity, the transitional arrange- ments to be made with future member states, and the future relations of an enlarged EC with its global partners.",

   "text_content" : "AS SUGGESTED in Mr John Major's thoughtful speech yes- terday, it is becoming a matter of some urgency for the EC to consider where it wishes to draw its eastern frontier. In this context, it is no good talking about a Europe \"from the Atlantic to the Urals\". That formula may be useful in regu- lating the deployment of troops. But it is not helpful when it comes to defining membership of an interstate organisation, because the Urals are not a frontier between states; not even between Soviet republics. Whatever parts the Soviet Union divides into, a Russian state will remain, with most of its population and industry on one side of the Urals but most of its territory and natural resources on the other. This state will continue to be a potential if not an actual superpower, with an essential role to play in European secu- rity - comparable in that respect to the US which is also a European power by origin and culture, but also stretches right across another continent. No sensible person in Europe wants to make an enemy of either superpower. But the European Community must be something smaller and more closely integrated than a vast free trade area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. It is an attempt by the small and middle-sized states of old Europe to get together so as to be able to deal with both the US and Russia (and Japan, and eventually China) on some- thing like equal terms. If either superpower became a member of it, all the other members would be dwarfed. The question is how many of the countries in east-central Europe - the broad region between Germany and Russia - can be incorporated into a European Community friendly to, but separate from, Russia. Potential members It seems to have become gen- erally accepted that those countries which were not part of the Soviet Union should be regarded as at least potential EC members. They were asso- ciated with Russia by force, not by choice, and it would be wrong for western Europe to force them back into such an association against their will. Now the same logic is being applied to the Baltics, which are \"a special case\" because most EC members never recog- nised them as de jure part of the Soviet Union. It is true that they were part of the Russian empire before 1917, but then so were Poland and Finland. Their historic cultural links are with Germany and Scan- dinavia, and the Scandinavian countries feel a special respon- sibility for them. If Sweden and Finland join the EC, the chances are that they will bring the three Baltic states in their wake. One must suppose that Mol- dova will be another special case, if its Romanian-speaking majority realises its aspiration of reunion with the mother country, from which it was severed in 1940 as a result of the same Nazi-Soviet pact that enabled Stalin to swallow the Baltics. But it seems very ques- tionable whether the EC would be wise to hold out even long-term hopes of member- ship to any other Soviet or ex- Soviet republics. To do so would look like an attempt to influence their choice in favour of separation from Russia, not only politi- cally but economically. That choice would be neither in their interest or that of the rest of Europe; and the Russians would deeply resent any west- ern European attempt to woo them away. Ukrainian sovereignty This would be especially true in the case of Ukraine. Clearly Ukrainians want to assert their political sovereignty and this is now accepted and recognised by the Russians. But it seems unthinkable that Ukraine with its large Russian-speaking minority and its close eco- nomic and historical ties to Russia, could become part of an economic and political union centred on western Europe, from which Russia was excluded. The problem of the Tran- scaucasian republics is rather different. They were incorpo- rated into the Russian empire only during the 19th century. Association with them is not of such great emotional signifi- cance, and only of marginal economic importance, to most Russians. But they are even further away from western Europe than Ukraine, and in Tsarist times were not thought to be in Europe at all. On the other hand, all three of them have common borders with Turkey, which has long been accepted as a European country and is a candidate for full EC membership. The prob- lems involved in this candida- ture remain formidable, given the size and rate of growth of Turkey's population and the wide cultural and economic dif- ferences between it and the present EC members. Yet Turks may well question whether these problems are really greater than those involved in expanding the Community to include east- central Europe and the Bal- kans, and the importance of Turkey to European security was highlighted by its role in the Gulf war. A positive attempt to overcome the issues dividing Turkey from the EC is required, keeping the door open to full membership if they really can be overcome. The integration of Europe's eastern end into the Commu- nity will certainly take at least a generation. But a positive commitment to achieve it is necessary, to create the cli- mate of confidence in which the problems of the transition to democracy and market eco- nomics can be tackled.",

   "text_content" : "BRITAIN'S Liberal Democrats cannot hope to win the next election, but they must now be taken seriously as a party that offers a radical alternative to the programmes put forward by the Conservatives and Labour. That was made clear at the conference which ended in Bournemouth yesterday. It is a considerable achievement for a faction that, just three years ago, struggled to emerge from the rubble of the former alliance between the old Lib- eral party and the short-lived Social Democratic party. Much of the credit must go to the party leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown. When he took alffice the Liberal Democrats stood at 5 per cent or less in the polls. They have since won impor- tant byelections. They now have 21 MPs, 3500 local coun- cillors, and the support of upwards of IS per cent of the voting pubic. At Bournemouth its members showed a sense of was rarely present in the old lAberal days. More to the point, they recognise the market as the driving force of the econoua. They seek to make its wors- inags more transparent, partly by extending competition.

   "text_content" : "New Dutch proposals on economic and monetary union have speeded up the talks, irrhtP Andrew Hill And Pptpr Nnrman Old Brussels hands have always had a sneaking regard for the way the Dutch handle European Community affairs. And this week the Netherlands, as present holder of the EC's rotating six-month presidency, has shown its mettle on the vexed issue of European economic and monetary union (Emu). A so-called \"technical paper\" tabled by the Dutch presidency at the end of last month has brought uncertainties about the direction of economic and monetary union to the surface, but it seems also to have quickened the pace of negotiation. While a casual observer might think the debate on Emu in recent days has generated more heat than light, important issues and taboos have been flushed out into the open. \"What we needed at the moment was more clear positions,\" said one Dutch finance ministry official after a meeting on Monday of the EC's Inter- governmental Conference (IGC) on monetary union. \"The Luxembour- gers (who presented the last draft Emu treaty during their presidency in the first half of year) did a wry good job, but made their texts rather foggy. We needed to be a little clearer.\" The Dutch initiative has brought the debate on Emu back to the funda- mental issue of whether the Commu- nity should progress towards union on the strength of the increasing con- vergence of the member states' eco- nomic performance - the so-called bottom up approach - or whether there should be a \"top-down\" imposi- tion of structures and deadlines. In a Community where agriculture is still accorded great importance, such concepts can be described in terms of horses and carts. The Dutch draft, representing an evolutionary plan, can be seen as one in which the horse has been put before the cart. Rival institutional schemes - and indeed the European Monetary Sys- tem when it was set up in 1979 - are more redolent of the cart being put before the horse. Almost as significant, the Dutch have managed to produce a document on Emu that has even left the British government clucking with satisfac- tion. This alone represents a remark- able achievement given that two and a half years ago, the then UK chancel- lor, Mr Nigel Lawson, was threaten- ing to block any move to union. The draft from the Hague - although officially termed a non-pa- per, and seemingly disowned late on Monday by Mr Wim Kok, the Nether- lands finance minister who is also current chairman of the monetary union IGC - has also aired the ques- tion of whether Emu should develop at two or more speeds more explicitly than any previous EC document. \"It was the first time that an EC paper had stated from the very begin- ning that there would be two groups,\" said an Italian official, making clear that future drafts will have to try to reconcile the two camps. The Dutch document was roundly abused by the southern EC member states in Monday's meeting of the IGC and has attracted critical comments from countries that support it. The European Commission has also described some of its proposals as politically unacceptable. But it probably represents an intel lectual break in the debate over Emu. It could mark an end to the ascen- dancy of the concept of an institution- ally driven union. This \"federal\" approach - with its emphasis on the creation of a Euro- pean central bank at an early stage of Emu and the setting of a strict time- table for achieving union - gained the upper hand from April 1989 after publication of the Delors report out- lining a three-stage progression to Emu - from the present European Monetary System, through integra- tion of monetary policies, to adoption of a European central bank and single k, b5 sil F al at ta Bi fa Si li] w tc b3 in st ai th so w D w m bi rt ti, ac Si ol fe th ni ta Â·~-~Â· a $t I zenith at the October 1990 European Summit in Rome when Mrs Thatcher was \"ambushed\" with an agreement which most member states chose to interpret as providing for the Euro- pean central bank in stage two of monetary union from 1994. The Dutch paper, by contrast, con- tains no firm date for the full or third stage of union and talks of a more embryonic European Monetary Insti- tute for stage two of Emu, and a cen- tral bank for those countries which graduate to full union in stage three. Above all, it stresses the impor- tance of economic convergence among EC member states before they prog- ress to Emu. For these reasons, it won Germany's outright support and back- ing from Britain in Monday's meeting. The paper stipulates that in the planned review of Emu's second tran- sitional stage in 1996, member states should only qualify for the final third stage of union when they have met a series of stiff conditions (see box). \"Emu on a Community scale with- out first fulfilling the objective crite- ria [for union] is something which would be economically unsound,\" explained a Dutch official. But the conditions caused a furore because they implied that Italy and Greece would not be able to join the union at the same time as the fiscally sound, low-inflation EC northern states. These indications of a \"two- speed Europe\" were borne out by a suggestion in the Dutch paper that a minimum of six EC countries could start the union from 1996 with the others joining later. Although they were not named, it was clear that the six would be Germany, France, Den- mark and the Benelux countries. Despite the criticism, the Dutch paper is not destined for oblivion. The Netherlands is already preparing a formal draft treaty on Emu for sub- mission before the end of next month. Belgium is taking some of the imme- diate pressure off the Dutch by pre- paring its own version of the text for discussion an informal meeting of finance ministers in Apeldoorn, in the Netherlands, at the end of next week.

Immediately after Monday's ministerial meeting Mr Kok expressed his aversion to a two-speed Europe and argued that the group of 12 should stay as \"tightly knit together as possible\" in advance of monetary union. He said he favoured offering the economic laggards derogations from the strict conditions. Mr Kok's comments sounded suspi- ciously like an attempt to have his cake and eat it. Officials at the finance ministry in The Hague admit there is \"a grey zone\" between dero- gations and the two-speed approach. But under a system of derogations, as defined by the Netherlands, the eco- nomic laggards would not join a com- mon currency and would retain autonomy in monetary policy. Dutch attempts to forge a consen- sus from Monday's more fluid discus- sions will be helped by the fact that France - which had been expected to ally firmly with the southern states against the Dutch paper - did not take sides. Indeed, although Mr Pierre Bdrdgovoy, the finance minister, favours agreement by all 12 EC states, French officials in Brussels say war- like alliances and strong statements would not be useful at this stage. Belgium believes it can draw together the opposing camps, headed by Britain and Italy, partly by propos- ing that at least a majority of member states should go through to the third and final stage of Emu. The Dutch minimum of six countries for stage three was too small a \"superleague\" for the liking of the southern states. Perhaps more important, Belgium would like to relax the strict eco- nomic conditions suggested in the Dutch technical paper, and hopes to weld the sluggish and go-ahead econo- mies together in stage three of Emu by giving them a joint say in the running of a monetary union. It is unclear whether such a dilu- tion of the Dutch plan would be acceptable to Germany or to Britain. Such a change could bring other objections to the fore. One German fear, eclipsed in Monday's debate, was that the proposed European Monetary Institute could open the way for national treasuries to influence mone- tary policy in the Community. The UK is also cool to parts of the Dutch draft. The UK Treasury does not like the inclusion of January 1 1994 as the starting date for stage two in the plan, has reservations about stage three being initiated by as few as six nations, and fears the EMI could undermine national control over monetary policy in a stage when union has not started. However, the Belgians believe the EMI has a part to play in an eventual refinement of the Dutch paper. They believe it could be absorbed into the central bank as the stronger econo- mies moved to stage three. \"That way, one would create an inter-insti- tutional climate which would be much more favourable to the non-par- ticipants [in stage three],\" explained a senior Belgian official this week. Such a compromise would, the Dutch hope, dispel fears of an institu- tionalised two-speed Europe. Although the Dutch seem happy their unofficial draft has aroused such debate, they now admit it represents one extreme of the Emu discussion. On the other hand, there is little doubt that political posturing has added to the heat generated over Emu this week. Dutch officials claim that when their paper was first discussed among the bureaucrats preparing the IGC, it only attracted drew hostile comment from Greece. This may help explain why there is a quiet confidence in The Hague that the formal draft treaty, that they will put forward next month in good time for December's European Council summit in Maastricht, will not differ too much from this week's \"non-pa- per\". If that turns out to be the case, the European monetary cart will be back behind the horse on the road to union.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Brian Shenton. Sir, While there may be a case for looking at additional routes across the Pennines (\"Transport plan for NW urged\", September 5), the need for change to the M62 must not be overlooked. It is a cultural shock to return to the M62 after several hundred miles on French autoroutes. The M62 is a boring, uninter- esting, dangerous and poorly managed highway which cries out for an injection of conti- nental flair, imagination and experienced management. The brown tourist informa- tion signs, pioneered in France, are slowly appearing on our roads. Yet the M62 remains 100 per cent blue. The introduction of the brown tourist signs would do wonders for the motorist. The French are able to explain rivers, viaducts, and canals to the traveller. Why should we not be told that the cricket pitch which perches on the edge of the Pennines is the highest in the world? The French also provide rest areas and have improved safety and traffic discipline. On steep inclines heavy goods vehicles are not allowed to pull out, spending five minutes to inch past another in the slow lane - all at 45mph and slow- ing. Going down the incline, drivers towing caravans are kept to a speed limit. None of these innovations will be tried whilst the road is nationalised and run by the Department of Transport and several other government agencies. The French, and indeed the Italians, have a dif- ferent structure using a single company for management Let the gove.nment set up the Trans Pennine Motorway plc and give it the contract to operate the M62. The private sector has had to bring in European partners for the pri- vate road in the Midlands because they have no experi- ence of operating highways. Now is the chance to give the private sector that experience. Success with the M62 could lead to the privatisation of the Ml. Now that would be an achievement.

   "text_content" : "here is now plenty o evidence to suggest tha the east German ecos omy is close to reaching th end of its two-year free-fall. Fa riskier to predict is when i will bounce back with sue tained growth. The good news first. A grow ing number of politicians ani economists in west German; are \"calling the turn\" based oi the stabilisation of unemploy ment, industrial order ani industrial production indica tors, and forecasts of 10 to 11 per cent growth in the con struction, trade and transpor sectors next year. Some of those indicators an not very reliable. Industria production was 5.4 per cen higher in June than in Mal (although still 37 per cen lower than the third quarter o last year), but a 10 per cen increase in industrial orders it June is distorted by a clutcl from the Soviet Union, anc unemployment is hidden b] short-time working and thi growth of make-work anm training schemes, many o: dubious worth. The number of genuint full-time jobs in east German3 is likely to be no higher thar 4.5m at the end of this yeai compared with 9m at the enc of 1989 and the DIW economic institute calculates that during the same period the annua: The jobless have a living standard closer to those in west Germany than any other east German group hours worked will have dropped from 8.9bn to 4bn. But as Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, points out, east Germany is adjusting from a labour market participation rate of 90 per cent of the adult population to something closer to the west German level of 65 per cent. He adds that people in east Ger- many have, contrary to some fears, mostly accepted the need for temporary unemployment levels of about 30 per cent (including short-time working) and quotes poll evidence which shows there is now a much higher level of optimism about the future in east Germany than in west Germany. In his own state of Saxony, 70 per cent are optimistic about the future. In east Germany as a whole, the figure is 62 per cent, compared with only 42 per cent in west Germany, according to the latest Allensbach polling organisation's findings. Thanks to the huge transfer payments this year (about David Goodhart and Andrew Fisher on the difficult economic transition still faced by east Germans DM150bn - Â£51bn) from west Germany even most of the east German unemployed are better off than they used to be when working. Indeed, the unem- ployed have a standard of liv- ing closer to their west Ger- man counterparts than any other group in east Germany. That may not prevent some ugly scenes this winter as ris- ing rents and prices start to pinch and more closures in problem sectors such as chemi- cals, shipbuilding and electron- ics push unemployment over 1.5m. (The increase in unem- ployment in July, after a one- year job security agreement in the engineering industry ran out, was smaller than expected but mainly because of the rise in job creation schemes). Nevertheless, as anyone who has recently visited east Ger- many's scaffolding-shrouded towns can attest, there is at least a palpable feeling that reconstruction is now under way. That was scarcely the case six months ago. It is also a great deal easier to telephone into and out of east Germany than it was six months ago, which is helping to erode east Germany's sense of separation. However Mr Carl Hahn, head of Volkswagen, sounds a note of caution. \"We realised earlier this year that the pessimism was exaggerated but I think the optimism is now also exag- gerated and there are still two difficult years of transition ahead.\" The caution is shared by the offices of the Treuhand privati- sation agency in Chemnitz, Leipzig and Frankfurt an der Oder, all of which report signs of recovery only in construc- tion and the retail trade. Mr Wolfram Hoschke, head of the Chemnitz chamber of com- merce, says the bottom will not be reached until early next year. The Chemnitz-based tex- tile industry says it has already hit bottom - but with only one quarter of the output of 1989. Therein lies the problem. Even if the optimistic forecast of 10 per cent growth in gross national product next year is achieved, east Germany's GNP at the start of 1993 will still be nearly 25 per cent below its Mlnlmr. IMH WHH . I0n MVÂ· m Ã½ MÃ½ Ã½= mU 1989 position. Also, although east German exports are stabi- ising thanks to DMlObn worth of Soviet orders this year, the region will run a current account deficit of DM129bn this year. Total imports of goods and services of DM183bn will be almost the same level as GNP at DM190bn, compared with a 1:2.5 west German ratio of imports (DM870BN) to GNP (DM2,180bn). East Germany will continue to produce very little of what it consumes, and remain com- pletely dependent on the west for several years, according to Mr Heiner Flassbeck of the DIW institute in Berlin. \"That means any weakening in the west will spill over into the east,\" he warns. Mr Kurt Kasch, head of the Deutsche Bank in west Berlin, welcomes the signs of life in construction and retail but worries that east Germany will end up with little manufactur- ing industry. \"There will not be a blooming industrial land- scape even in five to 10 years time,\" he says. What industry there is will be owned directly by west Ger- man companies which, accord- ing to Mr Kasch, is also less than ideal. \"If you don't have the company headquarters nearby you don't get the key functions like research and development and you get closed first. Just look at the experience of west Berlin,\" he says. Such a worry seems rather an indulgence when any manu- facturing investment is a rar- ity. Mr Thomas Kemmerich, a management consultant from Erfurt, says that the big com- panies such as Siemens and Daimler have all invested in east Germany for prestige rea- sons, but west Germany's backbone of larger Mitteltanad (medium-sized) companies are still notable by their absence. He also points out that most of the 400,000 enterprises founded since the beginning of 1990 are in the service sector and that many of them have subse- quently closed. The pace of privatisation by the Treuhand is holding up at a relatively high level. More than 3,000 out of the total of 10,000 larger enterprises have now been sold, and some whole sectors, in particular retailing, are now privatised. But what will be decisive for the indus- trial future of east Germany is how the organisation treats the 2,000 to 3,000 companies that are worth saving but cannot be sold for a year or two. Mr Kasch says there is a dis- pute within the Treuhand between those who stress pri- vatisation above all and those who want to concentrate more resources on restructuring companies which cannot be sold quickly. The Treuhand is planning to spend about DM12bn on restructuring this year. But some observers complain that although the company holding department at the Treuhand wants to keep as many of its charges as possible it cannot get the money from the finance department to invest in them. 'People can be dissatisfied if they are stagnating at high standards and satisfied if poorer but improving' \"About one-third of saveable companies will be liquidated because of lack of investment,\" estimates one insider. At least west German money is now being ploughed into investment - DM65bn this year - as well as consumption in east Germany. Mr Bieden- kopf reckons that with growth of 7 to 10 per cent a year per capita gross domestic product in east Germany will reach 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the west German level by the end of the decade. \"As long as peo- pie see things steadily improv- ing they will not worry so much about being equal with the west. People can be dissat- isfied if they are stagnating at high living standards and satis- fied if they are poorer but improving,\" he says. \"Things in east Germany are as not bad as some people assumed but they are also not as good as some people are now hoping in Bonn and Frankfurt,\" concludes Mr Kasch.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Geoff Beacon. Sir, Richard Layard and John Philpott repeat the con- ventional wisdom that \"unem- ployment is the price we pay for controlling inflation\" (\"A 12-month turnaround for the unemployed\", September 11). More accurately, it is the price the poor (now renamed the underclasses) pay. Layard and Philpott's answer relies heavily on \"high- quality training leading to recognised qualifications\". Before we all jump on the training bandwagon, perhaps we should ask to what extent training independent of the workplace actually increases an individual's ability to do a job. I remain highly sceptical of the trainers' claims. Their suggestion for a sub- sidy to employers for taking on an unemployed person has some merit: it does oil the fric- tion in the labour market. But some employers are already using similar schemes as long-term labour subsidies by sacking employees after the subsidised period has ceased and taking on new employees and new subsidies. Why not confront the prob- lem head on? At a given time, there will be people who can- not legally earn enough to have a civilised life. Instead of giving them life skills classes or paying them not to work, subsidise them into a job and, if subsidies need to be long-term, let them be long-term.

F Sir, I am afraid Richard Lay- s ard and John Philpott have put F the cart before the horse in \"A e 12-month turnaround for the I unemployed\" (11 September). s Their programme to help unemployed people cannot be sustained when the economy is I, set to function at a low level of demand throughout the 1990s. 3 Equally, we cannot even f countenance a new contract s between the state and the citi- zen until and unless one of , Beveridge's preconditions has been met - the achievement of a full employment. Indeed, even when full employment is achieved, a new framework of duties and obli- gations between state and citi- zen must in turn be condi- tional upon the quality of the job and training opportunities r on offer and the level of train- ing allowances and rates of pay o to unemployed people. d Inexplicably, Layard and Philpott fail to remind readers s that co-ordinated pay bargain- o ing is the linchpin to employ- t ment policies in both Sweden s and Germany. Instead of tucking away their reference to coordinated pay bargaining, they should have made this the precondi- tion to their programme. As Peter Robinson and I argued in the same column on September 3 (\"Time to make a stand on coordinated pay bar- gaining\") to attain full employ- 's ment - defined, say, as less .- than 750,000 unemployed peo- r- ple out of work - our endemic I pay problem must be solved.

Then we can get the economy a moving on a sustainable non- d inflationary basis. id As it stands, the Layard and ts Philpott article perpetuates the myth that fdll employment in K the UK has more to do with i. achemebuilding, rather than a b better functioning economy. r- Mark Corey, a C ' ps arW Work |o Au\"b e- bUSeUaIm ITon Blul. c- LeadlN NIS ERX \"- Fax service ~udresmpgem gme s Ir",

   "text_content" : "Jo P, Rnaniv None of us really under- stands demo- cratic politics in the absence of socialism. This is hardly sur- prising. We have had no prac- tice. From its spiritual home in the east, the ghost of Marx has always glowered at us. Since the revolution of 1917, the existence of a communist Soviet Union has been a part of the western political con- sciousness. In Europe, the presence of communist or socialist parties has been taken for granted for the past century. Now such parties are irrele- vant. The future of a French government based on an alli- ance between socialists and a dwindling communist party is questionable. President Fran- cois Mitterrand was squirm- ing at his press conference on Wednesday. He had to allow for the privatisation of minor- ity shareholdings in enter- prises the French had nationalised. The British Labour party is increasingly embarrassed by the use of the word \"socialism\", let alone any reminder of its past poli- cies of state ownership. Even Sweden seems likely to vote out its Social Democrats. Non-communists on the left may protest that mixing refer- ences to socialism, commu- nism and totalitarianism in this way is perverse - that there is no link between, say, western democratic socialists and the late Communist party of the Soviet Union. Yet every time another statue of Lenin crashes to the ground another subconscious tie to the thought of Marx, common to all parties of the left, is snapped. Programmes that accept or extend ownership of indus- tries and services belong to the dustbin of ideology. So do analyses based on the inevita- bility of class conflict, although classes continue to exist. These propositions began to be recognised during the 1980s. They were gener- ally accepted after the eastern European regimes were top- pled in 1989. Now the events of August 1991 have put the final seal on the process. Without socialism, all politi- cians are suddenly alone. Thus it would be wrong for liberals to regard the death of Marxist thinking as the con- clusion of the process of polit- ical struggle. With capitalism triumphant, not to say ram- pant, the new barons are the managers of large companies. In some countries they have politicians on their payrolls. Americans are aware of this. Socialist parties never made much headway in the US, but a prime motivator of the Dem- ocratic party has always been distrust of big business. Some continental Europeans also understand the point. The German model, which incor- porates powerful trade unions as \"social partners\", is evi- dence of that. Britain is different. For most of the 1960s and 1970s capital lived in mortal fear of Labour. The tables have since been turned. The unions are ciphers, trampled in the dust of Thatcherism. Considering their behaviour when they were on top, I view this with some satisfaction. No one per- If power is spread, the abuse of it cannot be absolute, or uniform son or institution should exer- cise untrammelled power. I would not trust my future to any of Britain's leading com- pany chairman acting without restraint, let alone to a Tory party in permanent govern- ment - and least of all to whoever happens to be the elected dictator of No 10 Downing Street, whatever his or her party. An alternative gang of barons may be given a chance if Labour, the unions' party, wins the forth- coming election. Big deal. And what if Labour fails? The example of the scandals in Japan is there to warn us of the consequences of continu- ous single-party government in a country in which big business has the upper hand. In such circumstances corrup- tion is not merely possible, it is inevitable. Leaving aside a strong trade union movement, the only countervailing forces I know of are regulation, trust-bust- ing, competition, a powerful, punctilious rule of law and a constitution that keeps gov- ernment in its place and pro- vides for redress when it overreaches itself. These are the very forces that Americans look to to protect them from the excesses or ille- galities of politicians, or man- agers for whom temptation has been too strong. This is not to say that the system works perfectly. Big business may be steadily gaining ground. The frequency of reported scandals seems to have increased. But the rule of law is the only tolerable system yet invented. In Britain our post-socialist politicians must address themselves to the imbalances inherent in the business-polit- ical complex. This is what the Liberal Democrats have attempted at their remarkably successful conference in Bournemouth this week. Their allegiance to a clean market economy puts the Tories to shame. They would, for example, break up British Telecom. \"We are determined to attack the monopolies, whether they are private or public,\" said Mr Paddy Ash- down, party leader, yesterday. \"We would increase competi- tion in the banking sec- tor .. . and we would introduce a new restrictive practices act.\" Their proposals for constitu- tional reform serve the same purpose. The list is familiar. It includes decentralisation of power to Scotland, the regions and local authorities; electoral reform; an independent Bank of England; a bill of rights; freedom of information; and so on. If power is spread, its abuse cannot be absolute, or uniform. If government is transparent, so much the bet- ter. Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign manager, argued forcefully on Wednesday that corruption is already embed- ded in British politics/busi- ness. If so, it is hedged with English inhibitions about cor- rect behaviour within minis- tries and boardrooms. But the danger increases. The prime minister knows, or should know, the proper response. \"We must heed the way the world is moving,\" he said in Paris yesterday, \"- towards more decentralised, more accountable structures\". He was speaking of the European Community. He would do well to apply the same stricture to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",

   "text_content" : "By Allson Smith Ashdown says Liberal Democrats will not support minority government THE Liberal Democrats will break up the unfair political system and rebuild \"bombsite Britain\", Mr Paddy Ash- down, the party leader, pledged yester- day as he warned Labour and the Con- servatives that he would not support any attempt by a minority government to stay in power. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats would, he said, \"be used as a battering ram to bring Britain fair votes and jus- tice in the ballot box\". Speaking of a mood of democratic renewal in the 1990s, which had swept through eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, he said that Britain could not be immune. In his end-of-conference speech at Bournemouth, Mr Ashdown set out rad- ical plans for \"quality economics\" in which government powers to manage the economy would be curbed, a more rigorous competition policy enforced and consumer power increased. He also spelt out the consequences of proportional representation in terms of a more stable democracy in which the economy was not subject to \"boom and bust', and there were no abrupt changes of direction. He challenged Labour and the Tories to say whether they would try to gov- ern if they did not win an overall major- ity, and said that if they did try they would risk long-term instability for short-term advantage, and show how little they valued democracy. Calling the 1980s the \"decade of demolition\", he said that Mrs Margaret Thatcher had failed because she could not build where she had destroyed, and he warned that poverty and squalor were undermining social cohesion. Yet Labour had no vision for the mrure: \"cautiousness, timidity, conservatism - these are reasons why Labour is unfit for government.\" In his own picture of a successful Britain, Mr Ashdown particularly stressed the importance of maximising women's potential. The most sustained applause came for his call for the private initiative and personal fulfilment of \"the selfish decade\" to be balanced by a sense of public good. Without referring directly to the party political broadcast last night by Dr David Owen, the former leader of the defunct Social Democratic party, in which he called for an all-party coali- tion of anti-federalist MPs, Mr Ashdown re-emphasised the Liberal Democrat commitment to a federal Europe. agjecang lears unan nuun wuusu us giving up its sovereignty, he said that \"real patriotism is wanting your coun- try to be a part of the new Europe\". With a promise not to indulge in attacks on personalities, Mr Ashdown's 50-minute speech contained little rou- tine mockery of other politicians, often a feature of party leaders' speeches. Representatives, however, greeted with delight, his attack on Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, as \"the man who put the bite into dog legisla- tion...who fathered the poll tax but won't pay the maintenance... who has given a whole new meaning to the term \"open prison\".

   "text_content" : "By Damlan Fraser in Havana CUBA is preparing a so-called \"zero option\" in case its eco- nomic crisis deepens, under which food would be handed out in soup kitchens, petrol for private use would be with- drawn and the supply of elec- tricity severely rationed, according to a Cuban official. Mr Raul Amado Blanco, the senior economist at the Bank of Cuba also said Cuba \"would reduce substantially invest- ments in health and educa- tion\", the proudest achieve- ments of president Fidel Castro's 32 years in power. Mr Blanco was speaking in an interview after the announcement by president Mikhail Gorbachev of the with- drawal of 11,000 of the 14,000 Soviet troops in Cuba. He described the Cuban eco- nomic situation as \"very tense - the worst I have seen in my 24 years at the central bank.\" Cuba's economy, which had shrunk in the first half of the year, would continue to fall as the year progressed. Cuba, he said, would face very difficult times for the next three or four years. The country has already introduced severe austerity measures, for example, import- ing bicycles from China and encouraging the use of horses and oxen in agriculture to cut the use of fuel. Items such as cigars and cooking oil have been rationed. But even if the economy con- tinues to deteriorate, Mr Blanco said investments will be maintained in tourism and other industries that earn hard currency. One Cuban academic referred to the \"zero\" strategy as the \"Cambodian option\". It would, he said, mark the end of the revolution. The central bank official's remarks reflect a growing des- peration over Cuba's economy, which is likely to deteriorate still further as aid from the Soviet Union draws to an end. According to Mr Gorbachev, a new Soviet agreement with Cuba will in the future be based solely \"on commercial interests\". The Cuban central bank offi- cial said that negotiations over an agreement would start soon, but they will be made more complicated by the need to talk separately with Russian republics. Some four-fifths of Cuban trade with the Soviet Union is with Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia and Kazakhstan. While some agreement is probable, the Cubans are unlikely to be offered as attrac- tive terms as they were this year, say to western diplomats in Havana. The government instead seems to be pinning its eco- nomic hopes on western for- eign investment. Last month Mr Raul Taladrid, the vice-president of the State Committee for Economic Co-operation, said Cuba would \"negotiate with the devil\" to survive economically. Mr Blanco said Cuba was open to foreign investment in tourism, light and heavy industry. The foreign investment decree was \"more flexible than any other socialist country's\", while cur- rent restrictions could be put aside on a case-by-case basis. Coban-U I roun Pae 2",

   "text_content" : "By Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent Fort Dunlon. Birminrham: A vast aem besiered by an industrial wasteland FORT DUNLOP, the symmetrical, red brick bulk signifying Birmingham to the 46m cars which pass it each year on the M6, could be turned into a \"glass palace\" according to developers. Tarmac Properties and Rich- ardson Developments, in a joint venture, have asked Bir- mingham City Council for planning consent to transform the building and develop 84 acres of industrial wasteland. The project would cost about Â£100m and create 4,000 jobs, it was announced yesterday, but it is not clear how it will be financed against the back- ground of depression in the property industry. Mr Don Richardson, who controls Richardson Develop- ments with his twin brother Roy, would go no further than to say that the joint venturers would both put in money and that there would be bank finance. He would not say how much had been paid for Fort Dunlop. Built in 1929-30, it was once the largest warehouse in the world, butit has not been used since 1985 when BTR, the industrial conglomerate, bought Dunlop, sold the tyre operations to Sumitomo of Japan but kept the Fort and the surrounding land. Plans to turn it into a shopping centre foundered and BTR sold it to Tarmac Richardson in 1989. Tarmac Richardson sees its suggested redevelopment as \"very much a workplace\". A glass atrium would be cut into the building. Restaurants, clubs and shops would occupy the ground floor with commer- cial and light industry on the next four floors and a hotel on the top two. Car parking and 1.25m square feet of industrial and commercial property develop- ment would be landscaped to provide an urban park. Plans have been drawn up , by Benjamin Thomas & Associ- ates, the US firm responsible for the redevelopment of Grand Central Station, New York. The joint venturers are well established locally. Tarmac Properties is part of Tarmac construction group, based in Wolverhampton. Richardson Developments is best known for its Merry Hill shopping cen- tre in the Dudley enterprise zone.",

He said he would use his veto to block efforts by Con- gress to bring forward the issue of $lObn (Â£5.9bn) of loan guarantees for Israel, consider- ation of which he asked to be delayed for 120 days. The loan guarantees are needed to finance the resettle- ment of new Soviet and Ethio- pian immigrants to Israel Yesterday Israel issued an aggrieved but mild reaction to Mr Bush's move. \"Israel is not seeking a confrontation with the US, its ally, just as our request for guarantees is not a provocation against anyone, nor a hindrance to the advancement of the peace pro- cess,\" said Mr David Levy, the foreign minister. Mr Bush has also faced pow- erful opposition from US sup- porters of the Israeli govern- ment. Not since President Jimmy Carter has a US leader staked so much of his personal authority on the attempt to reach peace in the Middle East. \"We are on the brink of a historic breakthrough,\" Mr Bush said in a passionate appeal to Congress and to the American people to back his Middle East peace strategy. \"A 12Mday delay is not too much for a president to ask for, with so much in the balance. We must give peace a chance,\" Mr Bush said. \"We have worked too hard to have thi request of mine denied.\" An estimated 1,000 Americar Jewish leaders from 40 states have come to Washington tc lobby Congress. Mr Bush comr plained he was \"one lonely lit tie guy\" against armies of lob byists lined up against him. \"We must avoid a conten tious debate that would raise a host of controversial issues issues so sensitive that i debate now could well destro3 our ability to bring one oi more of the parties to the peace table,\" he said.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "Shareholders in Glaxo could be forgiven for finding its latest results better than a cure for ulcers. The immediate blan- dishments of a 13 per cent increase in earnings per share, a 27 per cent rise in the divi- dend seemed more than enough to justify a 3.55 per cent advance in the Footsie's second largest constituent. But investing in a company like Glaxo requires a long-term view. The real question remains whether it can deliver a medium-term growth rate high enough to justify a multi- ple of more than 22 times. US investors, whose stake in the company has increased by some 10 percentage points to nearly a quarter over the past year, evidently have more faith in this regard than their Brit- ish counterparts. In the short term, there is still some room for doubt that the promised new growth cycle is actually at hand. Sales of the Zantac anti- ulcer drug are showing double digit gains, and there has been a positive response to the three new products which are even- tually due to become Glaxo's new engine of growth. Yet the benefits will not be fully felt till 1993, while next year's earnings will be hit by falling interest income and increased outlays on research. For the longer term, it is hard to fault the manage- ment's recipe of high research spending to develop truly inno- vative drugs which can then command high prices. Admit- tedly the spectacular growth rates of the 1980's are unlikely to be repeated, but Glaxo still has a substantial cushion against disappointment in its cash reserves. If its strategy works, British institutions may live to regret taking a short-term view of a company whose rating is still neck-and- neck with that of Merck. Rolls-Royce Rolls-Royce has had the for- tune to be doing badly when a fellow sufferer has been doing much worse. The combination of its grim interim results and British Aerospace's fall from grace has confirmed that the world airline industry is still in cyclical decline - witness Rolls-Royce's caution on the timing of a pick-up in its civil aircraft spares business. If there was no hiding the fact that the outlook remains bleak, there were reasons to be vaguely cheerful. Rolls-Royce has more jobs to cut if it is to match the productivity of its US rivals. The cash required will probably mean borrowings by the end of next year. partic- FT-8E Index: 2,641.9 (+15.3) Glaxo Share price relative to the FT-A All-Share Index ularly if the dividend is to be increased. Admittedly the Trent engine now has a launch customer in Thai Airways but it needs a really big order sometime soon. Chief among the encouraging factors was the controlled nature of the cash outflow, which included Â£30m for a land purchase at the Leavesden helicopter plant. Research spending was heavy, but the group insists the pro- gramme has now peaked. Thanks mainly to power sta- tion-related orders, the non-aerospace operations had a useful recession-resistant feel. That R-R shares were largely unaffected by the figures was more a reflection of recent suc- cessive bouts of weakness than any vote of confidence from the market. A prospective mul- tiple of 16 for 1992 puts them in demanding company, but the 7.5 per cent yield probably sets a floor under the price. United Biscuits In the unlikely event that United Biscuits has to fight a hostile bid, yesterday's interim profits would prove a useful response. Even with the bene- fit of acquisitions, a 4 per cent pre-tax advance seems good going given the first half bus- feting on both sides of the Atlantic. The company is plug- ging away at costs on the one hand, and pursuing higher margin, higher value added products (notably in biscuits) on the other. The European strategy looks to be working well at this early stage, and with the help of strong pizza and dessert vol- umes and the ditching of mar- ginal fish sales, the Ross Young's frozen foods business is being turned round. The questions for the future are whether Ross will be sold up, and to what extent the rela- tively low margins of Europe and the US can be improved. There are few more efficient food manufacturers and dis- tributors around but, Philip Morris apart, it all seems in the price. RTZ There is certainly no need to rush out and buy RTZ shares on the basis of anything the company said yesterday. On fundamental grounds at least, rising stocks suggest that metal prices will stay dull for 12 to 18 months, and copper( RTZ's main variable) probably has further to fall. There are precious few signs yet of any upturn in the industrial miner. als businesses or Pillar, which suffered severely in the first half as volumes continued to slide. Even after a 4p dip in response to the two fifths drop in half-year pre-tax profits, RTZ's shares at 569p are on a more demanding rating than in October 1987, and yield just 4.6 per cent. Whether that is justified depends on how far profits recover next year, and how much in 1993. The company is clearly well managed, conser- vatively financed, and generat- ing impressive amounts of cash( operating cash flow was only 11 per cent down in the first half, against the 43 per cent fall in earnings per share). The only puzzle is its insis- tence that the ACT problem - to some extent the conse- quence of a string of UK dis- posals in oil and gas, cement, chemicals and double glazing - will automatically right itself with time. Hickson Hickson has been doing rather better of late, its poor interim figures notwithstanding. But the friendly reception awarded to its Â£70m rights issue was a bonus - its shares rose by 5 per cent, continuing a strong relative performance as the market has been persuaded that the newish board is doing sensible things. The sale two weeks ago of the loss-making flooring subsidiary signalled that the group is serious about investing in its much-neglected core chemicals business. Share- holders who have doubled their money in a year would probably be right to back the rights issue.

   "text_content" : "Groun lifts navout and sees 'new cycle of arowth' from recently launched drugs. writes Richard Gourlav GLAXO, maker of the world's best-selling drug, yesterday reported a Â£101m increase in prof- its. The company said recently- launched drugs heralded a \"new cycle of growth\". The 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Â£1.28bn for the year to June pleased many analysts con- cerned that the engine of Glaxo's growth over the past decade, the anti-ulcer drug Zantac, might be running out of steam. Sales of Zantac grew 4 per cent to Â£1.61bn, but after adjusting for the adverse effect of translating dollar sales, underlying growth was 12 per cent. Group sales of Â£3.4bn were up 7 per cent, or 16 per cent in con- stant currency terms. About 15 per cent came from market growth and only 1 percentage point from price increases. The rise in earnings per share to 60.8p from 54p allowed Glaxo to increase its dividend for the vear by 27 ner cent to 28D. Glaxo's share price rose 47p yesterday to 1,368p, helped by the company's decision to split its 50p nominal shares into two worth 25p each in October. The results went a long way towards allaying fears that the rapid growth in sales of Losec, the anti-ulcer drug produced by Astra of Sweden, might have come at the expense of Glaxo's market share. Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo chair- man mai tha nanot uan haA haan particularly important as the company was now well into the successful introduction of a fam- ily of new drugs. Of the newly introduced drugs the most established is Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment used in cancer therapy, launched in the UK a year ago. Zofran contributed Â£78m in sales from the 35 countries where the drug has been launched. Mr Ernest Mario, chief execu- tive, said: \"Zofran may be the fastest new product development in pharmaceutical history.\" Glaxo is optimistic about Sere- vent, an anti-asthma treatment launched last December in the UK, and Imigran, an anti-mi- graine drug launched in the Netherlands in June and par- tially approved in the UK last month. Sir Paul said strong market growth when health authorities were increasingly concentrating on cost containment proved the value of research and develop- ment. \"You cannot get volume by simply producing me-too drugs,\" he said. \"You need new drugs in new areas and that means R&D.\" R&D costs during the year were Â£475m and Mr Mario expec- ted them to rise to Â£620m in con- stant currency terms, making Glaxo the world's largest spender on pharmaceutical R&D.

   "text_content" : "By Simon London and Richard Waters THE World Bank said yesterday that it was excluding Nomura and Nikko, two leading Japanese securities houses, from partici- pating in its bond issues follow- ing the scandals which have shaken the firms in Japan. The immediate effect of the ban will be to exclude the firms from participating in the bank's $1.5bn (Â£869m) global bond offer- ing expected later this month, among the most prestigious assignments in the international capital markets. Last month the bank suspended all dealings with Salo- mon Brothers, the US investment bank which has been affected by scandals surrounding the manip- ulation of US Treasury bond auc- tions. Unlike Salomon Brothers, Nomura and Nikko can take part in secondary market dealings with the bank. Mr Don Roth, the bank's trea- surer, said yesterday: \"Because of the scandals in Japan, they will not be in our underwriting syndicates.\" He refused to say how long the ban would last. A senior Nomura official in London said that he believed the ban would extend beyond the next bond issue, pos- sibly for some months. The heads of Nomura and Nikko resigned in June after it was revealed that companies had dealt with a gangster organisa- tion in Japan and compensated clients for losses on their securi- ties holdings. Last week, the Jap- anese Ministry of Finance said it suspected Nomura of manipulat- ing shares on behalf of gang- sters. The official at Nomura in London said that he believed it was this share rigging which caused the bank to act. Several US investors have stopped dealing with Nomura's securities broking arm. The Iirn- ois Municipal Retirement Fund and the California Public Employees Retirement System have told Nomura Capital, which manages part of their funds, not to put business through Nomu- ra's broking arm. The bank is among the biggest borrowers in the international capital markets and its global bond offerings are the most pres- tigious debt issues of their kind. Lead managers for the next global deal, probably a five-year Issue, are expected to be announced imminently, probably today. The bank has never appointed a Japanese firm to act as lead manager although Nomura has acted as a co-lead manager in every previous global issue by the bank. The bank pays underwriting fees of about 0.25 per cent for a five-year bond offering. On this basis the syndicate of banks han- dling the issue would share fees of $3.75m according to their ,,,.J....ab. 44r,,.",

   "text_content" : "William Dawkins on the death of a French policy 100% State owned companies 80% 60% State 40% 20% 0 : / ifP/- - e l F rench President Francois Mitterrand's decision to blow away the last frag- nents of his dwindling resistance o partial privatisations has mleashed a gale of speculation. Mr Mitterrand's policy of nei- her nationalisation nor privati- ation - or \"ni-ni\" - has been lore honoured in the breach han observance since its birth in he French president's 1988 elec- Ion manifesto. ' The share exchange between tenault and Volvo, the vehicle nakers, and the entry of NEC, he Japanese electronics group sto the capital of Bull, the state- iwned computer producer, testify o a gradual reduction of the tate's involvement in industry. So Mr Mitterrand's announce- sent on Wednesday that the gov- rnment would allow private avestors to take stakes in state- iwned businesses is no surprise, yen if it is the first time that he as openly acknowledged this. \"The false death of 'ni-ni',\" said 3 Monde's headline yesterday. lowever, the move removes ome of the ambiguity over what 'rance wants to do with its state ector - to let it take on as much rivate capital as is consistent vith the state keeping control. Yet the move also invites nportant questions. Which com- anies will put minority stakes i the the block first? Will the roceeds really be used for their wn development - as Mr Mit- errand says they will? Will the tock market absorb large hunks of new equity? The government has already nnounced the sale on the stock narket of 20 per cent of its hares in Crddit Local de France, bank specialising in lending to Dcal authorities, expected to aise FFr2bn (Â£200m) for the state his autumn. Beyond that, stockbrokers peculate that the partial privati- ation candidates will be profit- ble, have a high level of state wnership-so a significant stake an be sold without abandoning overnment control, and will be utside sensitive sectors like ramatome in nuclear energy or lassault in defence. Businesses in this category cclude, in the financial sector, (BNP), the leading state-owne' bank, and in insurance, Assur ances Gendrales de France an( Groupe des Assurances Nat ionales. They all have more thai a 70 per cent, state shareholding in contrast to other state sinan cial groups like Union des Assur ances de Paris, which is 55.7 pel cent owned, or Credit Lyonnais the 50.9 per cent government owned bank. They are all alread3 listed. In the industrial sector, possi ble candidates for a relaxation o: state control include Usinor Sacilor, the unquoted steelmaker Pechiney in aluminium ani Rh6ne-Poulenc, the listed chemi cals company. Their recent prof its falls might not make this thE ideal time for a sale, but all thre: would welcome the chance t( reduce the debts they have buill up to fund international acquisi tions. In aerospace, loss-making Ail France is having its capital needi fulfilled by the state with som: help from BNP. But Adrospatial and Snecma, the jet enginE maker, both nearly fully state owned, have room for manoeuvre within a special statute for thE aerospace industry limiting pri vate investment to 30 per cent. Adrospatiale is having difficul ties, like other aerospace groups and would no doubt like the free dom of its privatised UK counter part, British Aerospace, to makE rights issues. This leaves the question of thE conditions under which sales will take place. Mr Mitterrand said the proceeds of such sales will ib used to \"develop investment and jobs\", not to plug holes in th: state budget. He also said that the state sec tor must not be sold cheap. This was meant as a dig at the privati sation programme of the previous Gaullist government and con. firmed analysts' assumptions that the state will ask a high price for shares. Mr Mitterrand's emphasis on industrial investment implies a preference for issues of new shares, with proceeds going to the company, rather than sales of existing state-owned shares. However, Credit Local is an unusual case,.being the first in seven stock market offerings by state-owned companies under the current socialist administration to raise cash directly for the state rather than for the company. The other main option is for state businesses to sell minority stakes to industrial partners as part of a capital increase. This is the kind of deal envisaged in a government decree allowing for partial privatisations last April, modelled on the link between Volvo and Renault, in which the Swedish partner brought in capi- tal and took a 25 per cent stake. Another fund raising tech- nique, available to a handful of state companies, is to sell voting rights to holders of non-voting equity. The state sector has been allowed to issue up to 25 per cent capital in so-called certificates of investment, an option used by Crddit Lyonnais, Elf Aquitaine and Rh6ne-Poulenc and BNP. Prices of these certificates have risen sharply in recent weeks - BNP's have increased 16 per cent v over the past 10 days. 0 if ow much will be asked of the stock market's appe- a tite will remain unclear a until the government produces y more details of what will be for e sale. Stockbrokers talk of possi- a ble sales of FFrlObn to FFrl5bn e of state sector equity per year, which would represent a big r increase on the FFr50.9bn of y equity capital issued on the Paris s stock market last year. s That does not reckon with the a FFrl,562bn locked up in Sicavs - r the French equivalent of unit I, trusts - by the end of July, less a than 15 per cent of which is e invested in shares. Nor does it I- reckon with the estimated 34 per cent of French equities held by foreigners, who presumably if would study with interest any g offering from the state sector, g given that the government is a unlikely to let any of these com- t panies go bankrupt.",

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Toronto-based subsidiary of Britain's Hillsdown Holdings, is preparing itself for an acquisi- tion spree in the US and Canada by raising C$223m (Â£115.5m) in new equity. In the 15 months since Hills- down bought a 56 per cent stake in Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, its priority has been to shake up a notoriously sleepy company and to streamline its operations. The share issue, announced yesterday, indicates that Hillsdown is ready to make Maple Leaf a springboard for expansion in the North Ameri- can food industry. Mr David Newton, Maple Leafs president, told an ana- lysts' meeting that Maple Leaf had no specific targets, but expected to find something of interest within 12 months. Mr Michael Palmer, analyst at Sanwa McCarthy Securities in Toronto, said the new equity would enable Maple Leaf to spend up to C$lbn on new acqui- sitions without damaging its bal- ance sheet. The company has a total debt load of C$178m, down from C$258m a year ago. Mr Palmer said the share issue would improve the liquidity of Maple Leaf stock, making it more attractive as part-payment for any purchases. The 15.1m treasury shares are being priced at C$15, below Maple Leafs C$16.38 trading price yesterday morning. An underwriting group led by RBC Dominion Securities and Burns Fry has bought the shares, and is distributing 6.7m to the pub- lic. The remainder have been bought by Hillsdown to maintain its 56 per cent stake. Hillsdown last year put all its other North American operations under Mr Newton's control in Toronto."

   "article_dc_title" : "L&G Dives into Losses for the First Time in Memory",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper LEGAL & GENERAL, the composite insurer, yesterday plunged into the red for the first time in living memory, with interim pre-tax losses of Â£84.6m, against profits of Â£41.5m in the first half of 1990. The slump in the property market and substantially increased provisions against mortgage indemnity losses was the principal reason for the dis- mal showing, announced yes- terday by Mr David Prosser on his first day as chief executive. Mr Prosser has taken over the hot seat from Mr Joe Palmer who has retired. However, buoyed by the strength of its balance sheet and a solvency ratio of 64 per cent, L&G increased its interim dividend by 5 per cent to 6.2p. Losses from the general insurance business amounted to Â£134.7m (Â£20.3m), with provi- sions for mortgage indemnity claims lifted by Â£94m and sub- sidence leading to claims of Â£28m (OÂ£10m). L&G has only a 10 per cent share of the market for domes- tic mortgage indemnity insur- ance - which insures lenders against losses they may incur on the sale of repossessed prop- erties - but has taken a more cautious approach than any of its competitors. Actual claims amounted to Â£17m in the first half. Total provisions against future claims reached Â£155m. These provisions included cover for future claims arising from sales of properties already repossessed. In addition the group is also providing for claims that it believes will occur when mort- gages currently in arrears enter into default. Profits from the core life and pensions business declined to Â£57.3m (Â£60.4m), partially reflecting a fall of over 25 per cent in new annual premiums. * COMMENT The market had absorbed yes- terday's bad news well in advance. Indeed the shares were able to rise 4p yesterday to close the day at 437p. Despite some concerns about the slow pace of new business growth, life business is still profitable, and future results will at least be untarnished by further damage from mortgage defaults. Pre-tax losses for the full year should be pegged back to between Â£45m and Â£65m. The market will also be encouraged by yesterday's announcement that L&G intends to further reduce its exposure to the more volatile general insurance business. Moreover, the balance sheet remains strong, with the share price at a substantial discount to the embedded value con- tained within L&G's life insur- ance fund. The shares are unlikely to be a source of much excitement but defensive quali- ties - evident in the dividend yield of 5.6 per cent (slightly cheaper than the sector aver- age of 5.2 per cent) - should shore up the price.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox A STEEP rise in interest charges - from Â£1.2m to Â£17.5m - held the pre-tax prof- its increase at Associated Brit- ish Ports, the ports, transport and property company, to 4 per cent in the first half of 1991. The taxable profits of Â£31.7m (Â£30.5m) were achieved on a sharp leap in turnover to Â£197.1m (Â£97.5m), reflecting the Aldwych House sale. The ports and transport divi- sion's 47 per cent jump in trad- ing profits to Â£39.3m was driven by Immingham, Hull and Southampton, ABP's larg- est ports, and mainly reflected further cost savings since the abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme in July 1989. Since then ABP has halved the number of its dock workers to about 2,000. Turnover in ports and trans- port was pushed ahead to \"92.5m (Â£87.8m) by a 5 per cent increase in ports tonnage, par- ticularly container traffic at Southampton and bulk com- modities from Hull. Property investment profits of Â£10.1m (Â£7m) were helped by a rise in rental income from retailers. The group made a small profit on June's Â£75.2m sale of Aldwych House, its largest development, but a further Â£5m provision against work in progress kept the property development side to a trading loss of Â£200,000 (Â£2m loss). The Aldwych sale cut bor- rowings from Â£395m at Decem- ber 1990 to Â£344m at August 1991. Interest payable rose to Â£27.6m (Â£21.1m) but a fall in capitalised interest to Â£10.1m (Â£20m), following the comple- tion of development projects, pushed the interest charge to Â£17.5m (EÂ£1.2m). Earnings rose 5 per cent to 12p (11.4p) per share, outstrip- ped by the interim dividend, up 13 per cent to 3.1p (2.75p). Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said that the land reclamation and jetty extension plans at Immingham, where the esti- mated cost has risen from Â£30m to Â£50m, would proceed whether or not the joint ven- ture with National Power and PowerGen was successfully negotiated. * COMMENT The rocket of the ports profits since the NDLS abolition have given the group astonishing growth through the recession. Recent productivity gains and more capacity should now help it to make the best of a recov- ery in demand. Property devel- opment will probably continue to drag growth rates down, with no fast recovery in com- mercial property likely. But it seems churlish to complain that it greatly dilutes the group's attractions. Even though the scanty profit on the Aldwych sale looks a meagre return for the risks taken, it is a sale - a relief to those who felt the group was over- stretched - and is far better than most developers have managed. On full year pre-tax profits of Â£67m (Â£60.2m), after a Â£32m interest charge and earn- ings of 25p (23.2p), the p/e of 13.6 shows the market is will- ing to focus on the group's vir- tues.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Robert Peston BRENT WALKER last night gave its first encouragement to a takeover offer from Lon- rho by asking the interna- tional trading group what it would require when carrying out a due diligence inspection of its assets. Lonrho believes that its takeover bid is Brent Walker's only hope of avoiding receiver- ship, but a leading member of the steering committee of Brent Walker's banks stressed that the the original plan to refinance the troubled leisure group was not dead. He remained hopeful that dissident bondholders, who are threatening to put Brent Walker into receivership, could be persuaded to drop their resistance to the recon- struction. The banks would probably improve the new securities offered to them. The strategy of the banks, which are backed by the Bank of England, is to work towards securing agreement on the refinancing at the same time as Lonrho carries out its due diligence inspection. Lonrho last night received a letter from Lord Kindersley, Brent Walker's chairman, ask- ing for a list of its require- ments in carrying out a sinan- cial investigation. Hambros, Lonrho's financial adviser, replied to Hill Samuel, Brent Walker's corporate finance adviser, that it wanted to inspect various properties and wanted copies of evaluations of the group's assets already carried out by Touche Ross, the accountants, and Weather- alls, the property surveyors. Mr Paul Spicer, a Lonrho director , said if it received the \"green light\" from the com- pany the process could begin next week and would be com- pleted within three weeks. A decision to proceed would be contingent on the agreement of the steering committee rep- resenting the 47 banks. Mr Spicer said: \"The banks' reconstruction proposals are now dead. It is now a simple choice between liquidation and Lonrho's proposals. That is the equivalent of 20p in the pound or up to 65p in the pound under our proposals.\""

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay \"There will never be another Zantac,\" says Sir Paul Girolami, referring to the anti-ul- cer drug that has turned Glaxo into the UK's biggest industrial success story of the last decade. But a clutch of new drugs emerging from Glaxo's relentless research and devel- opment machine this year have begun to fuel \"a new cycle of growth,\" according to Glaxo's energetic chairman. Yesterday's announcement of pre-tax profits up 9 per cent to Â£1.28bn goes some way to support that optimism. In the first place, Zantac's time in the limelight is far from over even if the new generation of super-drugs are beginning to receive the glowing reviews. Zantac still accounts for 47 per cent of group sales at Â£1.61bn, which in constant exchange rate terms is growth of 12 per cent. This growth rate has slipped from 14 per cent in 1990 but Mr Ernest Mario, chief executive, does not foresee negative growth for the drug within the next five years. Glaxo still commands 40 per cent of the world market for anti-peptic ulcer drugs, down from 41 per cent last year. The company dismisses the assault on its patents from Genpharm of Canada, which has applied to the US Food and Drug Administration to launch a generic, or unbranded, version of Zantac. Its view is shared by Mr Steven Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at County Nat- West WoodMac, who believes Glaxo's patents are safe into the next century. In the respiratory field, Glaxo's growth has been as imtressive. Sales grew 15 per cent in constant exchange terms to Â£775m, while Glaxo's share of a market that Is growing by 16 per cent a year rose one percentage point to 26 per cent. Sales of Ventolin, the largest of Glaxo's respiratory products, grew in constant currency terms by 8 per cent. The launch last December of Serevent, the first new anti-asthma treatment in 20 years, had little impact on the year's fig- ures. However, its ability to act as a long- acting bronchodilator is expected to give it a rapid market penetration, analysts say. Antibiotic sales, accounting for 18 per cent of total sales, were Â£608m, with an underlying growth rate of 17 per cent. Glaxo's share of the cephalosporin market, considered the most competitive sector of the world pharmaceutical market, grew from 9 per cent to 11 per cent. While the growth of Fortum and Zina- cef, two antibiotic drugs, were a modest 5 and 11 per cent respectively in underlying terms, sales of Zinnat the oral version of zinacef, grew 47 per cent. Of the new drugs which Sir Paul hopes will take up the reins of growth, the best established is Zofran. Mr Mario said this anti-nausea treatment used in cancer treatment has been a \"life-saving drug\" for patients for whom chemotherapy would otherwise have been very difficult. Its sales reached Â£78m in the year to June - the first full year since it was introduced in the UK and France. It has now been approved in 48 countries and launched in 35. In addition, Glaxo launched Imigran, an anti-migraine treatment, in the Nether- lands in June this year and has just received approval for an injection form in the UK. In a notoriously difficult field for predic- tions, analysts have produced a particu- larly wide range of sales forecasts for this drug. At the pessimistic end, they project annual sales of less than $lbn; at the more optimistic end, over $3bn. Lehman Brothers' recent study of the new \"superdrugs\" which are likely to have sales of $500m or more by the year 2000, forecasts Imigran sales of $2bn a year. Overall Glaxo's sales grew by 7 per cent to Â£3.4bn but, stripping out the currency effect, were up 16 per cent, mostly due to a growth in markets rather than price rises. The company's commitment to research and development is, however, likely to hit margins next year, according to Mr Plag. This will be partly offset by lower market- ing costs, but margins will still slip slightly to 32.1 per cent, he says. Nor will Glaxo enjoy the level of invest- ment income it enjoyed in 1991, as a result of the high interest rates. Its Â£1.2bn of net cash earned the company Â£179m, up 26 per cent on last year. Sir Paul says that while this is a large amount of cash, it is a source of comfort for a company which has to take a long-term view as it may not see any return from its mushrooming R&D facili- ties for up to 10 years. A special dividend to hand some of this cash back to shareholders is out of the question, says Sir Paul. After all, this cash still represents only one year's profits."

   "text_content" : "By Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine manufacturer, reported a 90 per cent fall in first half pre-tax profits from Â£115m to Â£llm reflecting the current slump in the aerospace and defence sectors. First half profits included Â£26m in exceptional charges to cover the restructuring pro- gramme as well as an account- ing problem in South Africa. The company expects to face additional restructuring charges in the second half, but these are expected to be offset by savings in operating costs from earlier rationalisation. Overall, City analysts expect Rolls-Royce to report full year pre-tax profits in the Â£80m- Â£100m range compared with Â£176m last year. Sales rose by 5 per cent from Â£1.59bn to Â£l.67bn.However, profits were impacted by higher research and develop- ment costs of Â£118m in the first half compared with Â£86m in the same period last year. But the company said R & D spend- ing would be reduced in the second half. Overall R & D costs would be lower than last year's total of Â£237m. Aerospace profits were sharply down from Â£72m to Â£4m reflecting the decline in the military business and the current slump in the commer- cial airline industry. However, the company's industrial power operations turned in a better earnings per- formance with profits only slightly lower at Â£38m (Â£40m). Aerospace sales were mar- ginally higher at Â£987m com- pared with Â£983m while indus- trial power sales were Â£683m compared with Â£607m. The company said the order book was strong at Â£7.2bn.

Proceeds from the 3-for-' rights issue, at 14%p per share will be used to purchase Ware crete, a Hertfordshire quarr] business, and to pay debt.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Guy de Jonqul6res, Consumer Industries'Editor UNITED BISCUITS increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent from Â£83m to Â£86.1m in the 28 weeks to July 13, thanks largely to a strong perfor- mance in the US and contribu- tions from recent continental acquisitions. Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, said the improvement was made in spite of difficult trading experienced in UB's main markets. \"It would, I believe, be unwise to predict a significant upturn before the end of the year,\" he said, though he remained confident of a satis- factory full-year result. Sales rose 9 per cent from *1.4bn to Â£1.53bn. A 13 per cent rise in trading profit to Â£105m (Â£92.6m) was redaced at the pre-tax level by increased interest charges of Â£18.9m (Â£9.6m), reflecting acquisition costs. Mr Clarke dismissed specula- tion that UB might be a bid target, saying: \"I don't see any major hostile bids com- ing.\" Analysis of the compa- ny's share register had revealed no unusual change in ownership. Trading profits rose in all divisions, except Terry's, where weak sales of boxed chocolate was blamed for a fall to Â£3.1m (23.7m) on turnover of Â£62.1m (Â£56.1m). Profits at Ross Young's, the frozen foods business, recov- ered to Â£14.1m (Â£13.4m) on sales of Â£291.6m (EÂ£01.5m) fol- lowing extensive rationalisa- tion. The recession squeezed mar- gins on business in the UK, where trading profit rose 3 per cent to Â£64.4m (Â£62.8m) on sales of Â£825m (Â£823m). None- theless, volumes were 1.2 per cent higher at the McVitie's biscuits business, while the KP snacks operation increased its share of all main British mar. kets. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief execu- tive, said the Gulf war also had an \"extraordinary negative impact\" in the first quarter, though this was made up in the second quarter. Keebler, the US biscuits and snacks subsidiary, increased trading profit by 16 per cent to Â£31.4m (Â£27.1m) on sales of Â£512.5m (490.8m). New products helped Keebler raise its share of the declining US cookie market. while its Robert ClarKe: improvement acMleved despite dimcumes in main marnets sales of savoury snacks grew twice as fast as the US market. Trading profit from conti- nental operations trebled to Â£9m (Â£3m) on sales of Â£170m (Â£66m). The increases partly reflected the acquisitions since January of Oxford Biscuits in Denmark, 49 per cent of Fazer Biscuits in Finland and of Gyori Keksz in Hungary. Mr Nicoli expected to raise operating margins of the conti- nental businesses in the medium term from about 5 to 10 per cent by increasing vol- umes and improving efficiency. The interim dividend is increased to 5.5p (5.3p). Earnings per share were 12.4p (12.2p) on an undiluted basis and 11.9p (11.6p) after dilution due to exercise of war- rants and conversion of prefer- ence shares. See Lex",

   "text_content" : "By Peaav Hollinaer PORTALS GROUP, banknote paper supplier to the Bank of England since 1724, beat off the effects of recession to unveil a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Â£11.7m for the six months to June 30. Turnover rose by 3 per cent to Â£94.5m. Mr Michael Morley, chief executive, said he was encour- aged by the performance, despite pressure on margins in the protection and controls division. Operating profit in this busi- ness fell 25 per cent to Â£2.77m renIecting iosses incurrea in the first quarter at Airoil-Flare- gas, which makes low emission burners for the petrochemical industry. Margins declined to 6 per cent for the same reason. Airoil, which accounts for about 20 per cent of the divi- sion's turnover, had problems coping with high demand; new management had moved the business back into the black in the second quarter, Mr Morley said. Houseman, involved in air and water hygiene for build- ings, performed well, as did Computer Technology, he added. The best performance, how- ever, came from the security and specialist papermaking arm, which was strongly boosted by JR Crompton, the teabag paper maker acquired for Â£37m in March 1990. Turnover rose by 2 per cent to Â£48m, of which about Â£16m was due to Crompton, and operating profits improved by 16 per cent to Â£9.3m. One of Crompton's three mills was closed and Â£5m will be invested in the business's Lydney plant. Much of Cromp- ton's emphasis will be on envi- t ronmentally friendly, chlorine- i free paper. Mr Philip Conway, I executive director, said this I was a growing market, with I about 50 per cent of Cromp- ton's sales in this area. 1 Germany, following reunifi- ( cation, was an increasingly i important market for environ- a mentally friendly products. Banknote paper, by far the f division's biggest business, I maintained its position, despite e a setback during the Gulf s war. t The group warned that cen- tral results, which comprise property sales minus over- heads, would be significantly lower than last year's gain of Â£2.4m. Earnings per share rose to 13.39p (12.73p) basic and 13.21p (12.21p) fully diluted. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p. Gearing, based on net debt of Â£16.5m, was 16 per cent, one point higher than at the year- end. This included the out- standing balance of Â£12m on the Crompton purchase.",

Trading profit for the six months to endJune declined from Â£6.2m to Â£3.7m, and after interest charges doubled to E2.4m, pre-tax profits slumped from Â£6m to Â£1.3m. Turnover was Â£73.5m (Â£81.8m). The interim dividend is cut from 1.3p to 0.65p. Mr Michael Meyer, chairman and chief executive, said: \"The interim results should not be looked at in isolation from the full-year. Most of our profits in the consumer lighting busi- ness are earned at the end of the year.\" He said a principal cause of the fall was the reduction in sales at AIsy, the US consumer lighting company. Emess has responded by cut- ting the workforce by 500 to 2,900 and reorganising the business to reduce costs. Fully-diluted earnings per share fell from 3p to 0.6p.",

   "article_dc_title" : "High Margin Contracting Limits John Laing's Fall to 20%",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent JOHN LAING yesterday became the latest contractor and housebuilder to announce a sharp fall in interim pre-tax profits. However, the decline of approaching a fifth from Â£7.8m to Â£6.3m during the six months to end-June, was less steep than most contractors have announced during the past few weeks. The company said that net debt at the end of June stood at only Â£13m, equivalent to gearing of just 6 per cent. The stock market also took comfort from comments by Mr Martin Laing, chairman, that he did not expect to have to add to the Â£12m provision the group made last year against its land bank. Mr Laing said that there would have to be a further fall in house prices for provisions to re-occur. The shares rose 7p to 299p. Earnings per share fell from 5.9p to 4.8p and the group has decided to maintain its interim dividend at 3p. The last time this was increased was during the first half of 1988. Profits would have fallen fur- ther but for another strong per- formance from the group's con- tracting operations which have continued to benefit from higher margin work won dur- ing the late 1980s. Mr Laing said that the reces- sion in commercial and indus- trial property markets had led to a reduction in the value of the group's forward order book to Â£1.5bn, compared with Â£1.88bn at the beginning of the year. The housing division, which has struggled throughout the recession, incurred a further loss. The number of houses sold in the UK - the group operates primarily in south east England but also in Scot- land - fell by 29 per cent from 841 to 600. In the US, sales fell by almost a third from 191 to 129. However, the figure is expected to show a sharp improvement during the second half as sales, negotiated during the brief period of euphoria which fol- lowed the end of the Gulf war, are concluded. * COMMENT Laing, unlike many contractor/ developers which have announced results recently, is generating enough profits to cover its maintained dividend without dipping into reserves. It strengths are minimal gear- ing, which should remain - under 10 per cent at the year end, and a quality contracting business which generates a positive cash flow and has helped offset the collapse of housing profits. These it hopes, should be on the mend by the time lower margin work starts to impact on contracting earn- ings. Full year profits, after taking into account all the swings and roundabouts, could â be about Â£20m, the same as last year. This would put the group . on a prospective p/e of just , over 18. The shares are worth the price just for the comfort of the dividend cover.",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard BAD LOANS forced Halifax Building Society to make record loan loss provisions of Â£123m in the first half of the current year. Announcing interim results for the six months to July 31, Halifax revealed yesterday that its provisions against mortgage losses soared from Â£12m a year ago to Â£95m. Pre-tax profits were Â£307m, up from Â£285m a year earlier. \"We believe that this is pretty realistic provisioning,\" said Mr David Gilchrist, group general manager. Halifax also put aside Â£5m on commercial lending; Â£22m on personal loans; and Elm on its Maxim chequebook current account. Before making provisions, Halifax was able to report a sharp increase in its operating profits which were up by 36 per cent, but its assets grew by only 3 per cent in the first six months of the year to reach Â£55.9bn. Gross lending was Â£3.75bn, down from Â£5.64bn in the same period last year, and the num- ber of loans for house purchase fell from 120,000 a year ago to 89,000 in the first half of this year. The society's estate agency network reduced its losses from Â£8m a year ago to Â£3m, in spite of the continuing stagna- tion in the housing market. As result of its lower volume of growth, the gross capital ratio of the society improved to 5.2 per cent Analysts said they were sur- prised by the size of Halifax's residential provisions. Abbey National, Halifax's main com- petitor in the mortgage mar- ket, also increased its residen- tial lending provisions, but at Â£58m they were much smaller than those of Halifax."

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent RECESSION IN North America and the UK and slowing ecc nomic activity elsewhere sav- agely cut into first-half profits of the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining com- pany. RTZ's taxable profit dropped by 40 per cent, from Â£475m to Â£286m. Net attributable earn- ings, which RTZ suggests is the most relevant measure of its performance, plummeted by 43 per cent, from Â£269m to E154m. Mr Bob Wilson, chief execu- tive, said that, as the world's lrgest producer of mined raw materials for western industry, RTZ could not escape the con- seqluences when its customers were in the throes of recess- ion. SBut it had intensified efforts to improve efficiency and this -had resulted in substantial 0manpower reductions and pro- duitivity gains. Throughout the world, RTZ ;,had made about 7,000 employ- ees redundant in the past year, or about 10 per cent of its 'workforce. About 1,500 were in the UK. RTZ Pillar, the UK industrial offshoot, had made 5,000 redun- dant since early 1989. Mr Wilson warned there would be more redundancies in the second half. For example, the Rossing Uranium board meets in Nami- bia today to consider further output cuts and substantial redundancies. Mr Wilson said that redun- dancies in the first half would cost about Â£8m after tax but RTZ had cut about Â£4m after tax from annual costs. RTZ will pay a maintained interim dividend of 6p from earnings per share of 15.6p, down from 27.3p. Sir Derek Birkin, chairman, said that the board had decided not to increase the dividend in view of the uncertain outlook. \"We will take another'view of prospects at the end of the year,\" he added. Sir Derek said there were as yet few signs of recovery in the group's businesses. However, \"although the short-term prospects for the mining industry are cloudy, it if in munlih h++ar h lan a *han Bob Wilson: warned of more redundancies to come at the equivalent point in the last economic cycle. \"In the medium- to long-term RTZ's prospects are healthy,\" he added. Although analysts had been downgrading their forecasts recently, the half-year results were below most expectations. Against the general trend in the market yesterday, RTZ shares slipped by 4p to close at 59p. Turnover in the half-year fell by 14 per cent to Â£2.274bn. Vol- ume declines mainly in indus- trial minerals and manufac- tured products accounted for Â£47m of the drop in net earn- ingp, Â£34m came from lower prices and Â£14m from currency variations. ' * The stronger dollar also affected gearing which increased from 25 per cent at the end of I910 to 28 per cent. Cash flow fell by 11 per cent to Â£275m, exploration expendi- ture was reduced from Â£34m to Â£24m and expenditure on prop- erty, plant and equipment was down from Â£148m to Â£138m. The group wrote off Â£llm of advance corporation tax in the first half, up by Â£5m from last timer. See Lex",

However, BSL achieved small price increases to com- pensate for volume falls. \"It's not price sensitive - If they need a bearing they need it\". Tighter inventory control in BSL raised net cash to Â£2.7m at June 1990, compared with Â£500,000 at December and June 1990. Interest received fell to Â£121,000 (Â£255,000).

   "text_content" : "I By Jane Fuller PRIE-TAX profits fell by just over 20 per cent at Haden MacLellan Holdings, reflecting a lull in orders for paint-spray- ing equipment in the US and the effects of recession on the UK manufacturing and distri- bution businesses. In the first half of 1991, tax- able profit declined to Â£7.94m (Â£9.98m) on sales of Â£172.9m (Â£169.4m). Nearly half the operating profit of Â£8.42m (Â£10.9m) came from the European and Austra- lian paint shop business. Mr Philip Ling, chairman, said the UK was enjoying a record year thanks to work for Japanese car makers. But in the US, car makers had delayed projects and the North American operation, which includes some work for aircraft makers, made only Â£444,000 (Â£1.77m). \"We came into 1991 with a lousy order book,\" Mr Ling said. Now opportunities to bid for work were coming up and it was hoped these would translate into a healthy picture for 1992. The acquisition of Smith Engineering in California, for Â£4m early this year had prompted the group to set up an environmental division. Smith's cleaning of chimney emissions would complement the Drypure technology deal- ing with paint sludge. Distribution, which supplies nuts and bolts, agricultural products and machine tools, suffered a profit fall of more than Elm to Â£2.49m. No signs of an upturn in UK demand had been detected. Manufacturing, again cover- ing a wide range of goods including iron bridges and van- dal-proof toilets, was also Â£lm down at Â£1.68m. Mr Ling said that subsidiaries supplying capital goods had better order books than six months ago. \"Maybe we will see a proper, investment-led upturn.\" Interest costs were reduced to Â£480,000 (Â£1.3m), although the Â£13m cash held in Decem- ber had been eroded by work- ing capital requirements and the acquisition. Earnings per share declined to 5.5p (8.3p) because of a higher tax rate and increased equity. The interim dividend Is held at 3p. * COMMENT With the US side of the busi- ness probably being saved from the red by the environ- mentally friendly acquisition in California, all eyes are on the order intake for paint shops. On this side of the Atlantic, the Japanese factory- equipping spree is close to its peak and there should still be some good end-of-contract prof- its next year. The question what then is the perennial one for this lumpy contract-based business. The more the service and environmental wings can be built up, the better. The lit- ter could do with some help from zealous law makers. UK manufacturing and,jdistribu- tion, on the other bank needs a good old-fashioned tipttrn in volumes. A pre-tax profit fore- cast of Â£16.5m (Â£23.6m) gives a prospective p/e of less than 11 on yesterday's price of 128p. Supported by a yield of 8.3 per cent, the price should improve on the first whiff of US orders coming through. C I t C I t v u S a I d v u -- -- --",

Baird, which recently staged a Â£39m rights issue to raise capital for investment and acquisitions, has felt the effect of the recession on both tex- tiles and engineering, its two divisions. Mr Donald Parr, chairpan, said the markets for both businesses had been \"very weak indeed.\" Group turnover slipped to Â£239.lm (g240.3m) in the six months to June 30. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.55p despite lower earnings of 6.4p (9p) per share. Textile activities, where Baird is dne.of the largest sup- pliers of clothing to Marks and Spencer, were hit by wealk con- sumner demand and the impact of last spring's Increase in VAT. Operating profits from this source fell to Â£8.88m (Â£10.4m) in spite of slightly increased turnover of Â£188.9m (Â£185.5m). Darchem, the engineering division, suffered lower demand as the recession hit customers in the power, motor and aerospace industries. Opr- ating profits fell to Â£8.71m (WO.76m) on turnover of Â£502m (Â£54.8m). Interest charges rose to Â£E.13m (f2.58m). Proceeds of the rights issue, which arrived in May, should ensure that the group has no debt by the year end. Mr Parr said there was no sign of an improvement in con- ditions for textiles, although the market had reached a pin- *arn \"l 'rA nrdnr iner Airidn was likely to deteriorate fur- ther. 0 COMNT These results were slightly worse than the City had expec- ted, so Baird missed out on yesterday's mini-surge in the textile sector. The gPoup seems to have succeeded in stabilis- ing its position in textiles and ought to be able to hld its own 1ntil the clotbing wa et recovers next year. t engi- neering, which was slow to feel the effect of the reeon, still has some way to go before it comes out ofthe doldrums. Analysts expect a fall in pre- tax profts to aSfm for the full year, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 14. But Dar- chem's difficulties seem set to continue to cloud Baird's pros- pects, even though recovery is in sight for textiles.",

   "article_dc_title" : "The Fatal Attraction of Magnet's MBO",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "Michiyo Nakamoto reports on the kitchen retailer's Topsy-like debt SIGHLY leveraged buy outs are supposed to be risky. But advisers to the management buy-out of Magnet, the kitchen retailer, are finding that the risks are not simply restricted to sinan- ciers, as they themselves face legal action for negligence and misrepresentation from a dis- gruntled Magnet creditor. Bankers Trust, which led Magnet's Â£629m buy-out ii 1989, Arthur Anderson, which advised Magnet's mmanagment and Arthurl Young, the com- pany's auditor, are faing lega action by GE Capltal,.tihe financial services arm of Gen. eral Electric of the US. The US group has issued writs for damages against he three and against Airedale Holdings and Water Meadow Holdings, Magnet's parent companies following the MBO. GE is claiming that it was misled when it provided Â£70m of mezzanine finance for the buy-out and therefore its finance should rank higher up the scale for repayment. The move by 'GE adds another twist to the already complicated Magnet saga, which goes back to the spring of 1989. The controversial buy-out, led by Mr Tom Duxbury, then chairman and chief executive, ran into trouble even before it got off the ground. Shareholders at first resisted the terms, resulting in a long drawn-out wrangle that meant the buy-out was not completed until July although it was announced in March. Then, almost as soon as it was completed, the banks which provided finance to the deal found themselves unable to syndicate their exposure. The buy-out had been launched at the peak of the consumer and housebuilding markets, on which Magnet is dependent. But by the time it was completed, trading condi- tions had rapidly started to deteriorate. Banks opposed the deal on the grounds that profit esti- mates were too optimistic in the light of market conditions. Indeed, in their April offer document, directors stated that Magnet's pre-tax profit for the year to April 1989 was esti- mated to be about Â£72.7m. Letters from Arthur Young and Kleinwort Benson, which was acting as adviser to Mag- net, uphold this profit esti- mate. In fact, pre-tax profit for the year turned out to be just Â£45.9m. For Magnet's creditors, what happened in the few months magsa mvwrewso u1s m-umeu ana, wwn lmaasagM, disastrous buy-ot are belua sued by GE Capital after the buy-out was to alter materially the terms of their loans to the group. It soon became clear that the group would not be able to finance its debts out of its cash-flow. By December 1989, the group was forced to reschedule its loans and interest payments. Interest on Â£l10m of subordi- nated debt, Including GE's exposure, was deferred for at least three years. A document to shareholders outlining the refinancing agreement that Airedale reached with its bankers, notes: \"After the offers had been declared unconditional, the board became aware hat ... certain material defi- ciencies existed in the account- ing systems of the Magnet group.\" Two directors involved in the MBO, including Mr Dux- bury, who had been the driving force behind Magnet, had left by early 1990. The third has since left. A t the time of the MBO, a holding company, Airedale, was formed as the vehicle to buy out Mag- net Home Improvements, now renamed Water Meadow Hold- ings. Magnet itself, the trading company that sells kitchen fur- niture to consumers, was and remains a subsidiary of Water Meadow. The institutions which pro- vided financial backing to the MBO, including GE, made their loans to Airedale, the ultimate parent company, which was to fund its interest and principal payments out of an income stream consisting principally of dividend payments from Magnet. he loans were not secured against Mag. net's assets, which totalled about Â£340m. But Aire- dale and Water Meadow were to be merged after the buy-out, allowing creditors to secure their loans against Magnet's assets. When the trading environ- ment turned so dramatically against Magnet, Water Meadow's board decided not to merge with Airedale. The decision was based on the view that Magnet's cash- flow not would be sufficient to service Airedale's debts. Agree- ing a merger with Airedale would be tantamount to giving up Magnet's assets to Aire- dale's creditors. As Magnet's trading environ- ment remained weak, Airedale was forced to reschedule its loans a further two times in 1990. Borrowings and interest rolled over have since bal- looned to Â£664.8m and the com- pany has a negative net worth of Â£470.5m. In the year to end-March, Magnet reported pre-tax losses of Â£18.1m (losses Â£30.9m) on sales of Â£225.3m (Â£265.7m). No dividend payment was made. It does not, however, have any borrowings of its own and is unaffected by Airedale's debt nosition. Neither is it under any obligation to pay dividends to Airedale. For GE, all this means that the value of its Â£70m of mezza. nine finance to Airedale is vir. tually worthless. Water Meadow's decision has deprived Airedale's creditors of a claim to Magnet's assets as security against their loans. But these have have shrunk to Â£180m as a result of the plunges in property prices and In consumer spending. GE's debt ranks at the very bottom of a total of about Â£700m owed by the Magnet group to its creditors, so that even If Magnet's income posi- tion were to improve markedly in the years ahead, there is more than Â£400m worth of senior debt waiting to be ser- viced ahead of GE's own subor- dinated loans. Bankers Trust and the other firms being sued will not com- ment beyond saying that they are defending their positions against GE's claims. Airedale's other bankers have agreed to continue supporting the group financially through the defence. Indeed, they are baffled by GE's move, according to one source. GE would not comment on whether it has written down its loan to Airedale. But the lending agreement means there is no chance of raising the ranking of GE's loans and the only likely explanation for its action is that, having given up on its Â£70m exposure, it is resorting to legal action in an attempt to claw back what it can. The Magnet deal was sup- posed to hail the arrival of the mezzanine debt market in the UK. Bankers Trust was keen to expand its presence in the leveraged buy-out business, where it had expertise, while GE was expanding aggres- sively in the UK subordinated debt market. Ironically, as one of the largest MBOs in the UK at the time, the Magnet deal would have been seen by both as an ideal opportunity to make their mark in their respective specialist fields in the UK. By any standards the experi- ment was a disaster for both alike. Admitting that it has stum. bled over one of its first sub- stantial transactions may not do much for GE's reputation. But bankers close to the deal are wondering what it has to gain by further jeopardising Magnet's chances to start to repay its debts.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller TT GROUP, the industrial holding company, increased pre-tax profits by 46 per cent from Â£4.64m to Â£6.77m, in the first half to June 29. The results benefited from a six-month contribution from Crystalate, the electronic com- ponents maker acquired for Â£34m in shares and cash after a five-month battle. Group turnover more than doubled to Â£78.3m (Â£32.6m). Operating profit of Â£8.54m (Â£4.79m) was reduced by interest costs of Â£l.77m (Â£152,000) arising from the acquisition. Borrowings were small pre- Crystalate, but after the take- over gearing rose to 70 per cent. With the help of a Â£9.7m preference share issue in November, the year-end figure was cut to 40 per cent and had improved slightly since. The abortive bid for Mag- netic Materials, another com- ponents maker, cost about Â£3m cash to buy a 38 per cent stake. Mr Nicholas Shipp, a direc- tor, said the dividend would cover the related interest cost. The interim dividend increases to 2.2p (2p) on earn- ings of 6.5p (6.1p). The company's broker is forecasting full-year pre-tax profits of Â£14.6m (Â£10.5m). The share price rose 5p to 188p.",

   "text_content" : "FINANCIAL TIMES FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 13 1991 When you take possession of a brand new executive saloon you have a right to expect certain standards. The latest in automotive technology, for instance. The highest levels of comfort. And a car that functions perfectly from day one without experiencing any of those irritating little teething problems associated with some new models. So when we built the Citroen XM we were determined that everybody, from the first the latest generation of computer-controlled robots. They are able to check and modify their own work, thus ensuring uniform assembly to tolerances of less than 0.5 of a millimetre. And if robots can check their own work, so can humans. All factory personnel involved in the XM's production are responsible for doing just this as part of our 'Total Quality Plan' Consequently, hidden faults which can slip past inspectors at the end of the line are reduced almost to zero. As if this was not enough to make you feel comfortable, the XM's interior is spacious, luxurious, and specified to the highest levels. Another luxury the XM offers is that of choice. There are ten models and five different engines to choose from. They include a tax efficient two litre injec- tion engine available in three equipment levels. At the top of the range is the three litre XM V6 24 Valve which features every luxury including automatic climate control, finest leather upholstery and polished wood finish. proud customer onwards, would enjoy nothing but perfection right from the beginning. To achieve this, we did something that no other manufacturer had ever done. We took the first one hundred XMs to roll off the production line and subjected them to a rigorous test programme. This involved driving each car on the test track for twenty-two hours a day over a period of nearly three months. Between them, the cars clocked up two million miles while further producton was halted. Inevitably, two million gruelling miles did reveal some minor faults, but by modifying the HOW COULD THE CITROEN XM BE IN BETTER SHAPE AFTER TWO MILLION MILES? The investment in technology continues all the way along to the paint shop. In this sealed building, the air is constantly filtered to create a'zero-dust' environment in which each XM receives its flawless mirror finish. In the two years since it passed our tests, And in between are three turbo-diesels powered by the world's first multi-valve diesel engine. Finally, we have even made provision for factors outside our control. Our free Europe- wide 24-hour accident management and ~Â· Â· production process we were able to eliminate them from all future cars. Overall though, the car emerged from its ordeal having surpassed all the standards of quality and reliability we'd built into every aspect of its design and construction. It was a performance which proved our conviction that if standards were high from the beginning of the manufacturing process, they must be high at the end. Our meticulous attention begins with off-line sub-assembly. Over half of the XM's constituent parts are constructed independent of the production line and only brought to the line when they are perfect. The XM bodyshell is put together by CITROEN XM THE SHAPE OF TECHNOLOGY. the XM has been passing yours. The superior build quality and innovative engineering contribute to the extremely low running costs. And residual values are exceptionally high. (A comforting thought when it's time to take delivery of your next XM.) No less impressive have been the XM's technical achievements. In particular, the unique and revolution- ary suspension system. This intelligent computer-controlled sys- tem constantly monitors road conditions and the driver's responses in order to determine the most appropriate suspension setting. As a result the XM has a unique ability to switch, in 0.05 of a second, from a setting which gives unrivalled ride comfort to one which provides the responsive handling of a sports saloon roadside recovery service, Citroen Assist, will always be standing by. We think there is no finer executive car. So why not allow us to send you an in- formation pack with details of your nearest Citroen dealer? He will gladly introduce you to the pleasures of driving the XM. All we ask is that you make your test drive somewhat shorter than ours.

   "text_content" : "By Karen Fossill in Oslo NORSK DATA, the Norwegian mini-computer group, yester- day announced a sharp deterio- ration in its performance in the first half of the year and sig- nalled a radical overhaul of its operations. The company slid to a pre- tax loss of NKr257m ($38.8m) after net financial costs of NKr7m and an extraordinary cost of NKr20m. The result is in contrast to a NKrIm pre-tax profit in the same period last year. At an operating level, the group returned a loss of NKr230m compared with NKr10m a year earlier. Group turnover dropped 22 per cent to NKr950m from NKrl.22bn. The company's equity-to- debt ratio fell to 33 per cent at the end of June, from 44 per cent at the end of 1990. As a result of the loss, which weak- ened Norsk Data's liquidity, the company was forced to enter a sale-leaseback deal for its headquarters. Mr Erik Engebretsen, the president, said this transaction would add NKrl65m to liquidity reserves in the short term . He said lower sales and the side effects of losing several domestic public sector con- tracts would force 500 further redundancies, 300 of which would be in Norway. Mr Engebretsen also announced a fresh attempt to restructure Norsk Data's Scan- dinavian business into three companies. NordPartner will supply the public and private sectors with advanced information technol- ogy systems; ND Service Team will develop products and ser- vices for the computer mainte- nance business; and ND Datashop is to continue as a distributor of standard com- puter products. Analysts suggest that with the new restructuring, Norsk Data is positioning itself for a possible sell-off, which could return funds to shareholders who have witnessed the group's. three-year nosedive. The group's market capitalisa- tion has plunged to NKr400m from about NKrlObn in 1981 and NKr6bn five years ago. Lending support to these analysts suggestions, Mr Enge- bretsen said he had signed an agreement with QED Technol- ogy, part of Maxwell Communi- cations Corporation (MCC), to dispose of loss-making ND Comtec, which supplies com- puters to the printing indus- try. He would not be drawn on the sale price, but said the deal would be signed next month. In the first half of this year, ND Comtec suffered pre-tax losses of NKr55m. Norsk Data did not provide comparative figures, but said that in 1990 the company posted losses of NKr95m. The president said ND Ger- many, the principal German subsidiary, had suffered during the period. Due to a dispute between headquarters and German management, he was forced to install new exec- utive leadership in Germany. ND Germany plunged into a half-year pre-tax loss of NKr64m, but no comparative figures were given. Mr Engebretsen said that Germany had also suffered \"release\" problems for new Sroducts and that there had :een trouble in changing from user-specific to standard systems. ND Germany, which used to be one of the company's main profit centres, is in future to direct efforts towards increasing market share in the mechanical industry, library and building industry sectors. Efforts will also intensify in the search for industrial partners in Germany. Mr Engebretsen blamed Norsk Data's poor result on a combination of losses by ND Comtec and ND Germany, as well as NKr67m in restructuring costs and NKr20m related to extraordinary costs for winding down central European business.",

Earlier, a parliamentary committee gave its approval to Kinnevik , the investment com- pany owned by Mr Jan Sten- beck, to run the new channel. At present, it is responsible for the Swedish satellite commer- cial channel TV3. The decision, however, attracted immediate criticism for being taken on narrow party lines only four days before the general election. As a result of the uproar, the gov- ernment agreed not to endorse the decision.

   "text_content" : "By Karen Fossll in Oslo I STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, has bought a 5 per cent stake in Verbundnetz Gas, eastern Germany's gas monopoly, for about NKrl95m ($29.4m). The Leipzig-based company owns and operates 8,300 kilometres of gas transporta- tion pipelines and seven gas storage facilities, and employs a staff of 1,700. It buys natural gas and sells directly to commercial end-users as well as transporting gas to end- users. Mr Snorre Jensen, a spokes- man for Statoil, said although consumption of primary energy in the part of Germany where the company operated had recently decreased, Statoil was confident it would increase towards the mid-1990s, after a restruct- uring in the east German industry. \"Treuhandanstalt [the Ger- man privatisation agency] offered us the stake in January. We consider this a very good business opportunity for Statoil's gas business,\" he said. Statoil is one of Europe's big- gest gas producers and suppli- ers. Total gas sales in 1990 reached 3.1bn cubic metres. . The company also heads the Norwegian Gas Negotiating Committee (GFU), which mar- kets and sells gas on behalf of Norway. Last year, total Nor- wegian gas sales reached 25bn cubic metres. In 1990, the Statoil natural gas business unit had an oper- ating profit of NKr2.94bn.",

The deal ends a year-long search by Indevo to find an international parent company after its pro- posed merger with Bain&Co collapsed last year, writes John Burton in Stockholm. The failure of the Bain merger created financial prob- lems for Indevo's 70 partners, who' had staged a SKr305m ($49.4m) management buy-out of the firm as a step toward transferring ownership to Bain. The resulting debt burden forced Indevo's owners to file for bankruptcy protection ear- lier this year, and seek a new buyer. \"As a result of the agree- ment, we have achieved our earlier goal of gaining a big international market for Indevo while finding a financially and professionally strong owner,\" said Mr Ulf Hubendick, Indevo president.

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes In Bonn THIS YEAR'S results at Siemens-Nixdorf will be severely dented by integration costs of around DM500m ($287.3m), the German computer group admitted yesterday. However, it refused to comment on reports that it was also heading for a DM500m operational loss, and claimed that turn- over and orders were improving. \"After overcoming normal start-up difficulties, Siemens- Nixdorf has continued to increase its sales each month,\" the company said. At the half- year mark, turnover was 17 per cent down on the previous year, but by the end of August sales were lagging only 5 per cent behind the comparable flgare for 1989-0. New orders at the end of last month were 5 per cent up on the previous year, it said. It was responding to a gloomy report in Wirtschafts- woche, the business weekly magazine, which also cast doubts on the future of facto- ries in Cologne and Poing. The magazine said Siemens- Nixdorf might bid for the Ger- man software house SAP. The company dismissed both sug- gestions. Analysts said, however, that operating losses of about DM500m seemed \"reasonable\" in the light of the DM380m loss reported for the first six months of the year. The company has found the going hard since it was formed iJanuary 1990, when Sie- mens took over Nixdorf to save it from collapse. It has struggled for longer - and at greater expense - than expec- ted to integrate the two busi- nesses, while at the same time coping with recession and fierce competition in the com- puter market. Nine months ago, Mr Karl- Hermann Baumann, finance director, said he hoped Siemens-Nixdorf would break even this year after an operat- ing loss of DMSOOm in 1989-90. In March, the company admitted that a break-even point would not be reached this year.",

The move will mean ai after-tax charge of $243m an( push it into the red for thi third quarter. Mr Reuben Mark, chairmai of the second largest US house hold products group, said thi rationalisation would allow thi company to capitalise on thU European Community's move to a single market and the free trade agreement between the US and Canada. It would also enable it te benefit from more sophisti cated and efficient manufactur ing techniques and consolida tion opportunities created bj several recent acquisitions around the world. Mr Mark, chairman for thi past six years, has been widell praised for turning it from a sleepy, inefficient business into one with annual earnings per share increases averaging 17 per cent. The driving force behind this has been an improvement in profit margins by consolidating manufacturing and distribu- tion, investment in new plants and sales of peripheral activi- ties. The company said the latest round of restructuring was designed to ensure \"its growth momentum continues and its 1991-95 profit goals are reached or exceeded.\" Savings gener- ated by the reshape would help finance new product launches and other initiatives. The company did not esti- mate the size of the third-quar- ter loss, but in the same period of last year it made $84.4m, or $1.20 a share. The $243m charge will work through at $1.81 per share. In the first half of this year it reported net income of $184.6m, nr L1 11 a nhar in I1 rn wnn+ on sales of $3bn. Mr Mark said yesterday that the outlook for the rest of 1991 was positive. The company said the plant rationalisation would be car- ried out over the next three years and would mainly affect Europe, North America and the South Pacific. The plans included the trans. ser of Canadian production of powder detergents, liquid cleaners and bar soaps to the US, although the company would continue to produce high volume household and personal care products in Can- ada. It would also be closing a plant at Queluz, in Portugal, and integrating its facilities with those recently acquired as part of its Quimigal joint ven- ture, which more than doubled Colgate-Palmolive's presence in the country. The company would be clos- ing its manufacturing complex at Liege in Belgium and ration- alising various Australian operations."

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group formed last year through a merger between the insurance compa- nies Amev and Groupe AG, pushed up profits by nearly 11 per cent to Ecul77m ($208.86m) after tax in the first half of 1991, against Ecul60m in the equivalent period. The group said it was cau- tious about issuing a full-year profit forecast at this stage, because of the difficulty of pre- dicting profits from gains on investments. However, it expected profit for 1991 at least to match the Ecu393m net result for 1990, barring exchange-rate fluctuations and unforeseen circumstances. Groupe AG, Belgium's larg- est insurance company, and Amev, the third largest Dutch insurer, formally merged in December, creating Europe's 12th largest insurer with 20,000 employees, mainly in Europe and the US. Each company took on a 50 per cent stake in Fortis, and they retained their separate stock market listings. Total income for Fortis rose from Ecu3.24bn to Ecu3.59bn in the first half, and operating profits rose nearly 15 per cent to Ecul53m, against Ecul33m. Fortis said yesterday the results had been boosted by a technical recovery in the non- life sector, excluding accident and health insurance. In the first six months of 1990, that sector lost Ecul9.1m following the severe storms across western Europe. Most of the benefit of the recovery from last year's storms was taken in the first quarter of 1991, when Fortis announced a rise in profit of 31 per cent, with non-life losses recovering from Ecu27m to Ecu3.8m. Banking sector results also improved in the first half, mainly because of higher inter- est marains in the Nether- lands. The company increased profit in banking activities from Ecul6.3m to Ecu22m. Non-life still lost Ecu7.lm in the six months to June 1991, partly due to disappointingly poor results from the UK non- life operations and a decline in fire and motor insurance business. Fortis said that if the storm factor were excluded from the 1990 results, the sector's performance had deteriorated in the first half. The group said life insurance operations in the UK had also turned in an \"unsatisfactory\" performance in the first half, but better results in the Netherlands and the US helped boost the overall profit for life insurance activities from Ecu56.2m to Ecu62.4m. Accident and health insurance also improved, returning profits of Ecu23.4m (Ecu21.7m), an increase of 8 per cent.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "NTERNATIONAL Busi- ness Machines' competi- tors were the first to wel- come this week's announcement that the US computer group was making important additions to its new generation of mainframe com- puters. IBM's mainframe competi- tors hope the announcement will resolve the uncertainty that has seriously disrupted the computer market for the past year. IBM's introduction of a new generation of mainframe com- puters began last September with the announcement of its Enterprise Systems/9000 family of products. The highest perfor- mance models of this new range are just beginning to reach customers. Now IBM has added seven new models span- ning the middle of the main- frame performance range. The transition to its new generation of mainframes has stalled the computer market, as customers waited to assess the new models before making purchase decisions. The sales slump, affecting all mainframe companies, has been com- pounded by recession in the US and Europe. As the mainframe market leader, IBM has suffered more than most from this market slowdown. Its revenues declined by 8 per cent in the first half of this year while profits took a 74 per cent plunge. Industry analysts have been predicng that IBM may this year recrd its first annual revenue drop since 1946. Slack demand for mainframe computers has also prompted a vicious price war, with wide- spread price discounts of 40 to 50 per cent. Competitors now hope that pricing pressure will recede as IBM focuses on sell- ing its new product line. \"We have seen some stabilis- ing of price declines over the past few weeks and we are hopeful that this will stidk,\" said an official at Hitachi Data Systems, a manufacturer of IBM plug-compatible main- frame computers. Plug-compatible computer makers, such as HDS and Amdahl, are gaining ground on IBM in the mainframe market- place and have been able to rapidly replicate the perfor- mance and features of IBM's latest computer products. Both companies have already announced computers that match some models of IBM's ES/9000. Nevertheless, IBM maintains an overwhelming 85 per cent share of the \"compatible\" mainframe market. In the US and European markets, it is by far the mainframe market leader with few challengers, while in Japan, where it faces a more difficult market envi- ronment, it remains one of the Sha Share pds ($) 140 Slack demnand for mainframe computers has prompted a vicious price war, with discounts of 40 to 50 per cent, writes Louise Kehoe. Competitors now hope that pricing pressure will recede as IBM focuses on selling its new product line. leading mainframe suppliers. Among IBM's most pressing competitors in the mainframe computer market are those who sell second-hand IBM com- puters. Its sales force now has the task of persuading custom- ers that the advantages of the latest computers are such that they are worth almost two times the price of a \"recondi- tioned\" older, IBM model with similar performance. With its new product intro- ductions - encompassing more than 100 related software and service products - IBM has also confronted the chal- lenge that \"open systems\", based on industry standard software, pose to its base of proprietary mainframe com- puter software. Bowing to pressure from its customers, IBM said it intended to offer a version of AT&T's popular Unix com- puter operating system pro- gram, to run on its mainframe computers. IBM officials also placed new emphasis on the company's determination to provide links between its own computers and those from other manufac- turers. \"A company's informa- tion system today can contain hardware and software of all sies from many different ven- dors,\" said Mr William 0. Grabe, IBM vice-president. IBM's goal is to offer soft- ware and support services that will link all of its computers and those from other manufac- turers on \"enterprise net- works\" spanning distant corpo- ratefacilities. It also announced a concept, called the Information Ware- house, in a bid to secure the role of the mainframe com- puter in the midst of chal- lenges from smaller, lower cost computers. This scheme places the mainframe computer at the centre of a corporate network as the data communications manager. Nestled among IBM's slew of new products were some that could have a positive short-term impact on the com- pany's financial performance. Industry analysts pointed in particular to IBM's announce- ment of new mainframe com- puter data storage systems with up to 50 per cent more capacity than current models. The group has marshalled its wealth of technical and mar- keting resources in a deter- mined effort to quicken the pace in the computer market and it will certainly need all of them to counter the broad eco- nomic trends that are slowing sales throughout industry.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York By I FIRST INTERSTATE Bancorp, one of the largest banks on the west coast of the US, yesterday warned that it expected to lose some $200m in the third quarter because of a sharp deterioration in its Californian property loan portfolio and a major restructuring designed to cut its expenses by $250m a year. It also expects to lose money in the full year, and the shake-up will mean a cut of about 3,500, or 10 per cent, in its staff. The Los Angeles-based group, the fourth largest bank in California, said it expected its Californian non-performing assets to increase by $300m to $350m from the second quarter level of $441m, mainly because of real estate difficulties. It added that a high percentage of the loans were still contractually performing. The announcement will increase Wall Street's anxiety that the general downturn in the Californian real-estate market, and consequent rise in problem loans, has a considerable way to run. First Interstate warned earlier this year that it was planning a restructuring package, but its $250m cost reduction target and the $90m charge it will take for this in the third quarter were towards the upper end of analysts' expectations. Its shares responded positively, and in mid-afternoon trading on the Pacific Stock Exchange stood at $31%, up $%. The bank has been plagued in recent years by unexpected reserves and losses, many of them the result of its expansion outside its Californian base into other Western states. In the second quarter, it reported a net loss of $80.3m after making provision for credit losses of $295m, up $159.8m from the first quarter. It said yesterday that consolidated non-performing assets had recently been on a downward trend or flat, but the problems at its California bank meant it now expected an increase in the third quarter from the second-quarter level of $1.78bn. The $250m in cost savings it aims to achieve in 1992 will come both from streamlining its banking operations and imposing a new regional structure on the organisation. At its California bank, most of the savings will come from 1,500 Job cuts, the closing or consolidating of 10-15 of its 330 branches, and the elimination of less essential services.",

   "text_content" : "By Karen Zagor POLAROID, the US maker of instant cameras and film, yes- terday said it would buy back its preferred stock from Corpo- rate Partners as part of its plans for the $925m it received from Kodak in July to settle a patent infringement suit. Polaroid, which will have about $400m in proceeds after taxes and a mandatory reduc- tion in bank debt of $160m, will also purchase $150m of its com- mon stock and pay employees incentives of $30m after tax. Analysts said the most sur- prising element was the plan to retire preferred stock held by Corporate Partners, a group led by Lazard Freres. In 1989, Corporate Partners bought $100m in series B convertible preferred stock with annual cash dividend of 11 per cent and $200m in series C with annual payment-in-kind divi- dends of 11.5 per cent. Kodak will pay $280m in cash for the preferred stock and issue $140m in 8 per cent convertible debentures. The move frees Kodak from the heavy cash dividend on the preferred stock and reduces the dilution associated with the Corporate Partners pay-in- kind preferred dividend. Mr Alex Henderson, an ana- lyst at Prudential Bache Research, believes the restruct- uring of the Corporate Part- ners stake will add about $24.2m, or 48 cents a share, in earnings available to common shareholders, given estimated net income of $114m for 1991. Mr I. MacAllister Booth, chairman and chief executive, said: \"We are particularly pleased that Corporate Part. ners has once again demonstrated its commitment to Polaroid, working with us to restructure its position in a way that will have a favourable impact on our net results while remaining a sig nificant and constructive investor.\" The transaction is subject to definitive do documentation and the approval of any rele vant third warties.",

   "text_content" : "I By Karen Zagor in New York CAROLCO, the US film pro- duction company, expects its Terminator 2: Judgment Day to be one of the top grossing motion pictures ever made. In an industry renowned for big spending on unpredictable products, Carolco stands out for what it pays its star actors, directors and writers. The Los Angeles-based company is believed to have spent close to loo100m to make the latest Ter- minator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The investment appears to have been fruitful, with Carolco expecting the film to gross more than 1a42m world- wide, while breaking box office records in the UK, Japan and Australia. In the UK, CaroIlo said the film grossed $21m in 25 days and is likely to surpass all other films released this year. Terminator 2 had a record opening weekend in the UK and also set a world record for the biggest weekend in one theatre at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. However, it is unclear exactly how much of the pro- ceeds will end up in Carolo's coffers. It is standard practice in the motion picture industry to sell off foreign distribution rights in exchange for cash to make films. However, analysts believe Carolco has more con- trol of its distribution than Orion, which has also pro- duced a number of hits this year while edging close to bankruptcy because of cash flow problems. Carolco's strategy has not always been successful. It has produced a number of com- mercial disappointments, with domestic film rentals falling below production costs for sev- eral films. In the first quarter of this year, Carolco posted a loss of $6m.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron in New York and Sara Webb in London A BETTER-than-expectei producer prices figure pushec US bond prices sharply highei yesterday as hopes r of ax interest rate cut by the Federa Reserve. In late trading, the bench mark 30-year government bonc was up S at 1011, yielding 7.95: per cent. The two-year not: was also firmer, up A at 100C to yield 6.168 per cent. Tradini activity was reported to bi robust. Prices had opened firmei before the inflation data, bul took off when the Labol Department announced thai producer prices rose by just 0: per cent in August and con producer prices (minus fooc and energy) also rose by 0.2 pei cent. Analysts had been expectini a rise of 0.3 per cent in botl categories, and the figurei immediately sparked buyini on speculation that the dath would persuade the Fed tha there was room for a cut in thi discount rate from 5.5 per cen to 5 per cent. Although there was n( response from the Fed, mos market professionals believi that interest rates will be cut possibly after today's con sumer prices data are released A rise of 0.4 per cent is expec ted in consumer prices - any thing less and the chances of i Fed ease will rise appreciably although it is likely that the central bank will want to wail until early next week befor lowering the discount rate. n UK government bonds ralliet strongly on news that thn increase in average earnings fell sharply in the year tc July. The underlying annual rat: of increase in average earning! Italian bond trade hits fresh peak TURNOVER on the screen-based Italian bond market soared to a record ol L10,679bn, breaking the previous L9,040bn peak set on Tuesday, Reuter reports from Milan. Volumes and prices surged in trading boosted by heav3 foreign buying, active futurei trading on the Paris Matif and the expected reimbursement ol a 12.5 per cent withholding ta: on paper held by foreigners. Volume on the Matif alsc July from 8 per cent in June. One trader said the gilt market had expected an increase of between 8 and 8.25 per cent for the year to July, and that the earnings data was seen as \"very bond-positive, especially at a time when wage settle- ments are coming down\". The market will focus on today's Retail Price Index for confirma- tion of a fall in inflation, which is expected to be between 4.2 and 4.5 per cent. Long-dated gilt prices increased by about half a per- centage point with the result GOVERNMENT BONDS that the yield curve became more inverted. The benchmark '1% per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose to 114% from its opening price of 1131, to yield 9.64 per cent. Short-dated gilts rose slightly, underpinned by hopes of a further cut in the base rate over the next month. News that unemployment in Britain has risen to a season- ally adjusted 8.5 per cent of the workforce in August from 8.3 per cent in July had little effect on the market as it was in line with expectations. U JAPANESE government bonds rose to new highs again amid expectations of a cut in interest rates. Prices rose across the range of maturities, with the bench- mark 10-year JGB moving to a new high since the start of 1990, to yield 6.135 per cent. The yield on the No 129 benchmark bond opened at 6.17 per cent and closed at 6.14 per cent, on a relatively low vol- ume of Y563bn. Short-term interest rates shifted down yesterday, with the overnight unsecured call money rate trading at 6si per cent, compared with 7 per cent the previous day. Traders pointed out that call money rates tend to ease slightly towards the end of the reserve maintenance period, adding that attention would focus on whether the call money rate falls further next week at the start of the new reserve maintenance period. SFRENCH government bonds closed higher, following the US Treasury bond market's lead. The September bond future traded up to 106.66 on thin trade, up from Wednesday's close of 106.46. The 9.5 per cent bond due 2001 rose to 103.85 to yield 8.86 per cent, compared with 103.54 at Wednesday's close. *THE YIELD spread over the latest German bund due 2001 narrowed from 49 basis points to 46 basis points. German government bonds barely moved yesterday morn- ing, but made small gains on the US Treasury bond market's rally. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 85.33, moved to a high of 85.48 before slipping back to 85.45. * ITALIAN government bonds continued to rally, boosted by heavy foreign buying and hopes of falling interest rates in the international markets. Foreign investors hope to have the withholding tax on their coupon payments reimbursed, thereby increasing the attrac- tiveness of the Italian bond market.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harverson in New York THE American Stock Ex- change yesterday announced plans to launch a new stock market with lower listing standards for smaller compa- nies that operate in fast-grow- ing industries. The ASE's \"emerging com- pany marketplace\", which requires approval by the Secu- rities and Exchange Commis- sion, is an attempt to win busi- ness from the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock market which is home for many small public companies with records of rapid expansion. The ASE said it hopes to attract some of the 2,000 com- panies that trade on Nasdaq as well as private companies that want a listing on a stock exchange. Trading on the mar- ket could start as early as next year. Mr James Jones, chairman of the ASE, said companies would need to meet a set of financial criteria to earn a list- ing on the new market, and would have to operate in industries that are poised for substantial future growth. He said: \"We want to iden- tify those companies of the future and bring them into an auction market.\" The ASE hopes that some companies will prefer to have their stocks traded on its floor- based auction market, rather than on the screen-based over- the-counter system employed by Nasdaq. In the past few years the ASE has developed a number of innovations to compete with the other two big stock mar- kets, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and with the growing number of electronic off-exchange trading systems. The innovations have included offering a home for equity derivative products such as options and warrants, and allowing listed companies to create multiple classes of stock with unequal voting rights.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong MANDARIN Oriental, the hotel group controlled by Jar- dine Matheson, yesterday blamed a 23 per cent fall in interim net profits on increased competition and stagnant tourism in Hong Kong. Mandarin is the first of the Jardine group to announce interim profits. Dairy Farm, a retailer, will announce results today, with others in the group following next week. Mandarin said profits after tax and minority interests had fallen to US$17.4m in the six months to the end of June, compared with $22.6m in the same period last year. Turn- over also declined slightly to $59.1m from $60.8m last time. The company is maintaining its interim dividend at 1.41 cents a share. The flagship Mandarin Ori- ental Hotel in Hong Kong faced increased competition because three new luxury hotels opened in central Hong Kong last year. Mandarin's hotels in Singa- pore, San Francisco and Bang- kok were affected by weak market conditions due to the Gulf war and recession. * San Miguel Brewery, the Hong Kong subsidiary of San Miguel Corporation, the Phil- ippine food and drinks com- pany, said net profits had fallen 10 per cent to HK$54.4m (US$7m) for the first eight months of the year. The company was affected by weak consumer demand and high inflation.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London PEMEX, the Mexican state- owned oil company, yesterday launched a $150m seven-year Issue in the international bond market, the longest-dated deal since Latin American borrow- ers returned to the market last year. The issue, lead managed by INTERNATIONAL BONDS Swiss Bank Corporation, pays a coupon of 10% per cent and was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par, where the yield spread over US Treasury bonds is 245 basis points. Pemex led the return of Latin American borrowers to the international market last October with a $150m three- year deal and is widely regarded as among the best credits in the region. Since this first deal was launched, bor- rowers from Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina have raised finance in the Eurobond mar- ket. Yield spreads have nar- rowed and the maturity of deals has lengthened. With this deal Pemex was again testing the limits of the possible for a Latin American borrower. Participants in the deal said the yield spread was tight and noted resistance from some investors. However, there was enough demand to support an issue of this size and syndicate manag- ers reported new investors buying Mexican debt for the first time. Once freed to trade by the lead manager, the deal remained at around the fixed reoffer price. The Council of Europe sur- prised many market partici- pants by launching an Ecu500m 10-year deal lead managed by Goldman Sachs. The deal is the first substantial Ecu bond issue since the Euro- pean Community's Ecu435m deal launched in early August. The issue carries a 9 per cent coupon and was reoffered to investors at a fixed price of par. At this level the bond yields 9 basis points more than the French government's Ecu- denominated OAT bond. The pricing was initially considered to be tight by market partici- pants, but the deal soon saw strong demand following an impressive rally in secondary market prices over the past month. Bond yields at the 10-year maturity have fallen by around 30 basis points since July. Buy- ing appears to be concentrated at the longer maturities and the deal was designed to tap pent-up demand. From an issue price of par the bonds traded up to 100.15 bid by the close of trading, helped by another strong day in the secondary market. The success of the deal increases the chances of the European Bank for Reconstruc- tion and Development making its debut bond issue in the Ecu sector, thought to be its favoured funding option, within the next two weeks. Ontario Hydro launched its expected C$lbn 30-year global bond offering, increased to C$1.25bn in the face of very strong demand from Europe and North America. The deal, lead managed by Goldman Sachs, will be priced today to yield 58 basis points over the Canadian government long bond. Participants said the pricing was safe and that the issue met with overwhelm- ing demand from both Europe and North America. The introduction of a 30-year Canadian dollai bond into the Euromarket was welcomed by many intermediaries as aiding M-kÂ« -f.,'lAÂ»_Â«Â» 46 -4s <.Â«n",

   "text_content" : "JAPANESE banks have continued to raise subordi- nated capital to bolster their capital adequacy ratios ahead of the September half-year end, writes Emiko Terazono. Earlier this week, Mitsubishi Bank issued $175m in subordi- nated guaranteed bonds in the Euromarkets. Last month, the Bank of Tokyo launched $220m of Euro subordinated debt. However, analysts do not see a repetition of last year's prob lems, where banks, in order tc meet interim capital adequacy requirements, flooded the mar. ket with subordinated debt issues totalling up to Y2,800bn. To prevent a recurrence, the Ministry of Finance concerned at the negative impact on a volatile stock market, has tightened control on the amount and timing of new issues. Some banks have been dis- creet, tapping the private placement market. Sumitomo, Fuji, and Dai-Ichi Kangyo have raised around Y60bn from life insurers between March and July this year.",

   "text_content" : "Patrick Harverson on the US response to regulatory shortcomings HE US Treasury hai moved quickly to intro duce changes to the wa] it sells government securities changes that are intended tx repair the reputation of UI bond markets battered by the Salomon Brothers bid-rigginj scandal. The speed with which the Treasury has initiated reform is a surprise. When the firsi hearings into Salomon's illegal activities began seven days ago, the message from the Treasury and its regulator) partner, the New York Federal Reserve, was that reform would have to wait until a detailed review of the auction process was completed. Yet by Tuesday, at the sec ond Congressional hearing, the Treasury announced a numbez of reforms to the system. Although the first changes appear minor, they show thai the regulators are willing to respond to calls from outside for a more open market. The Treasury has been forced to speed up the reform process by pressure from Con gress, which has demanded quick action to address the reg- ulatory shortcomings high- lighted by the Salomon case. The first, and most immedi- ate, change affects the influ- ence and power of the primary dealers. As of yesterday, the panel of executives from dealer firms which regularly meets to advise the Treasury on auction matters will no longer have early and exclusive access to information about the govern- ment's borrowing require- ments. Instead, data on the Trea- sury's quarterly borrowing needs will be released publicly two days before the auction details are announced and before the Treasury meets with the dealers' advisory panel. This will allow the rest of the market equal access to infor- mation that helps bidders decide how to price their bids in the auction. The Treasury has clipped the advisory panel's wings because of fierce criticism from legisla- tors who disliked the power wielded by the primary 4ealers and the privileged status they enjoy, courtesy of the Treasury and the New York Fed. Mr Donald Riegle, the Demo crat chairman of the Senate banking committee, said at Tuesday's hearing: \"The cosy relationship between the pri- mary dealers and the regula- tors must be thoroughly exam- ined and, I believe, ended.\" Mr Riegle attacked a system which effectively restricted competitive bidding to all but a chosen few, and questioned whether there was a need for \"the cartel system we have cre- ated through the primary deal- ers\". Mr Richard Breeden, chair- man of the Securities and Exchange Commission, echoed these concerns when he ques- tioned whether primary deal- ers have too much power in the Treasury market. Mr Breeden said the role of primary dealers should be reconsidered in view of the risks of market manipulation and the perception that the dealers are part of a \"cartel- like\" organisation. Of the other changes planned by the Treasury, the new rule requiring customers who bid for securities through primary dealers to provide written verification of their Richard Breeden: questions primary dealers' power in preventing dealers from fak- ing customer orders. It was the discovery of a faked order sub- mitted by Salomon's head trader in February that eventu- ally led to the exposure of the firm's illegal activities. The establishment of a new group to improve the sharing of market surveillance infor- mation among the Fed, the Treasury and the SEC will also be welcome. One of the clear- est lessons of the Salomon affair is that a lack of commu- nication and co-operation among regulators created supervisory gaps that were too easily exploited by unscrupu- lous dealers. promise to speed up the introduction of an auto- mated auction system should also win the Treasury some points. It has pledged to have the first phase of an elec- tronic system in place by the middle of next year. An automated auction sys- tem will give investors more confidence to bid on their own, rather than through dealers, and the increased visibility of the market will help deter potential wrongdoers. The changes announced at Wednesday's hearing are unlikely to be the last word on reform from the regulators. It was significant that the Trea- sury admitted to the subcom- mittee that it was considering the merits of different systems to allocate bids and set prices at auctions. The idea of using a \"Dutch auction\" system - where all bidders pay a single price - was mentioned, and appeared to have the backing of Mr Breeden of the SEC, although the New York Fed was cool about the idea. More work also needs to be lone on codifying the Trea- sury's rather informal rules about market practices. Two senior senators have already ntroduced a bill to Congress hat would make it a violation As securities law to falsely bid !or government agency debt. The ripples from the Salo- non scandal are beginning to listurb other waters. In the :ourse of its investigation into :he activities of the primary lealers in the bond market, the SEC discovered a large number >f securities houses had placed alse orders for the debt of qua- i-government agencies such as he Federal National Mortgage Ussociation. The revelation of malprac- ice involving other fixed-in- :ome securities is a realisation )f one of Wall Street's biggest ears: that the Salomon-in- ;pired investigations would %xpose a whole host of sharp rading practices employed by irms trading in US financial narkets.",

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb THE BANK of England is seeking to reassure the market that any attempt to corner the government bond auction scheduled for later this month would easily be detected by its regulatory procedures. However, there has been concern about possible market manipulation in the past. It has emerged that soon after Big Bang, concern about the rise in price of a small, illiquid gilt issue forced the Bank to issue additional tranches of the stock in order to avoid distor- tions in the market. The Bank started to issue government debt again this year, having steadily bought back gilts between 1987 and 1990. It uses auctions as well as tenders and taps to issue new stock. It claims that if it suspected a gilt-edged market-maker (GEMM) of attempting to cor- ner the market in a particular gilt-edged stock, it would sim- ply issue further tranches to meet the demand and avoid a p price squeeze. This practice vu cannot be used in the US bond p market where the only means b of issuance is through an auc- a tion. rs The Bank, which is able to c limit allocations to 25 per cent of an auction, requests daily d reports from the 18 GEMMs ti showing their positions in each t gilt issue for capital adequacy ( purposes. 1 i By comparison, in the US, tb nrimnrv rldaloar nnlv have tn n provide the Federal Reserve with weekly reports on their positions in certain maturity bands. The Bank also has access to Stock Exchange records showing gilt sales to clients. Clients are free to bid directly to the Bank at auc- tions, but most of them prefer to bid through a GEMM. GEMMs often warn the Bank in advance if they are planning to submit large bids on behalf ns lntanmare",

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington THE US Department of Agri- culture yesterday said hot dry weather at the summer's end lower grains output, while leaving the massive cotton crop untouched. For the second month in a row, the USDA forecast a Soviet grain harvest of 190m tonnes, 45m tonnes below last year's near record harvest. The Department dropped its initial estimates for the US maize harvest by 2 per cent to 7.3bn bushels, an 8 per cent decline for the year. Soyabean production was forecast at 1.8bn bushels, a 3 per cent drop over the month and a 5 percent reduction from last year. Cotton production is forecast at 17.9m bales, up 15 per cent from last year and the largest American production since 1937. The USDA projected Soviet grain imports for 1991-92 at 37m tonnes, up more than 10m from last year. It based its fore- cast on the assumption that the Soviets would get \"various forms of international assis- tance.\" In Washington, US farm groups have been seeking sup- port for improvements in the food credit guarantee package for the erstwhile Soviet Union. US banks have been unwill- ing to take up the three-year USDA credit guarantees made available this year because they back only 98 per cent on the principle and 4.5 per cent on the interest rates. Sugges- tions that the Soviets will ask for rescheduling on their old debt have added to the pessi- mism. The US Feed Grains Council has already put together a series of recommendations to make the credit guarantees more attractive to US and for- eign banks. It wants the US government to offer Moscow or the republics $3bn minimum in credit next year and to enhance the interest rate guar- antee from the fixed 45 per- cent rate to a variable coverage of 80 percent of the London Inter Bank Offering Rate. The American Soyabean Association is also pushing for more food aid and credits. However, a delegation, which returned from the Ukraine this week concluded that any aid would have to be carefully tar- geted. Mr Tom Brennan, an ASA official, said: \"I have some reluctance with sending in massive quantities of food to the detriment of existing struc- ture. If we flood them with pork, then their farms won't have a market.\" Food aid would have to be directed to the pensioners, orphanages and other poor. The Administration is expec- ted to formulate its policy after the return from the Soviet Union of Mr Richard Crowder, the USDA undersecretary who was dispatched by the presi- dent to make an intensive study of the situation.. For both political and for- eign policy reasons, the Administration is expected to find a way to help its former adversary as well as to satisfy its farm lobby.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent A RELATIVELY gloomy picture of the short-term out- look for metals was painted yesterday by Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist for the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining com- pany. He suggested that stocks of the main traded metals, already bulging, would con- tinue to rise during the coming year if producers took no action to cut output. Aluminium was the worst affected and prices, currently well below most producers' costs, might drop another 5-10 per cent if there were no reduc- tions. \"Some very big produc- tion cuts are needed to stabi- lise aluminium prices,\" said Mr Crowson at a presentation con- nected with the announcement of RTZ's half-year results. Copper prices were also des- tined to fall. He said: \"I would be surprised if copper stayed above $1 a lb or dropped below 80 cents a lb in the next six months.\" Mr Crowson pointed out that prices and sentiment were par. Aluminium Stock/Consumption ratios (weeks) 10 8 ... ........... 6 4 2 oQr Sour ticularly affected by the stock/ consumption ratio, which mea- sured the number of weeks consumption in stocks. The level at which stocks could be described as \"normal\" had fallen considerably in the past ten years to six weeks' for aluminium, slightly less for copper, about five and three- quarters weeks for zinc and four and three-quarters for lead. In July aluminium stocks had risen very sharply to eight weeks consumption, well above the normal level, copper was at 6.2 weeks and zinc at 5.9 weeks, he pointed out. Mr Crowson suggested that demand for metals, which had not fallen much in 1990-91 would revive next year, but mainly in the second half. But \"unless supply (of LME traded metals) is trimmed back, and in some cases substantially, stocks will continue to grow, even with healthy rises in con- sumption.\" He said that present influ- ences on the gold price were predominantly adverse. It would easily be possible to make out a case showing why gold would fall to $300 a troy ounce and below. \"But it prob- ably won't fall that far, he added.\" * Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said that, although the recession had hit metal prices hard, it was cyclical and \"I don't see the need for indus- try closures as a prerequisite for recovery.\"",

Falconbridge will cut 4,000 tonnes of production during the rest of this year by shut- ting down one of two electric furnaces at its operations in the Dominican Republic and suspending some mining at Sudbury, Ontario. Inco, the second-largest nickel producer after Norilsk in the former Soviet Union, said earlier this week it would reduce output by 4,500 tonnes in 1991. The price of nickel for deliv- ery in three months, which had advanced by $212.50 a tonne on the LME since Monday, fell back yesterday to close at $7,949.50 a tonne, down $28. The cash price fell $50 to $7,955 a tonne. Traders said the three months price met resistance at $8,000 and this was likely to be a formidable barrier.",

   "text_content" : "By Victoria Griffith in Sao Paulo THE BRAZILIAN government has announced that it will pro- pose a coffee retention scheme as an alternative to an inter- national export quota system at the London meeting of the International Coffee Organisa- tion later this month. Officials at the ministry of economics in Brazil also said it was \"very likely\" that the government would make available funds for the scheme from Funcafe, the government agency which offers credit to coffee farmers. Local growers, who have assumed responsibility for fin- ancing the scheme, believe the Funcafe funds, about $168m, will more than cover the cost of retention. The Brazilian government will present a proposal together with Colombia to withhold 10 per cent of coffee from the market The scheme has already won the support of key coffee sector representa- tives in Central America. The governments are also hoping for the adhesion of African and Asian producers. The plan is still riddled with uncertainties, however. The question of financing has not yet been resolved. Moreover, there is doubt over the future of 17m bags (60 kg each) of coffee the Brazilian federal government has in stock. The governments of Colom- bia and Brazil have agreed that no federal stocks will be released until an international decision has been reached on the coffee retention scheme. Brazilian producers are hop- ing that the plan will go into effect as early as October 1, and that it will boost prices significantly. Farmers say they are not discouraged by the recent fall in international prices. \"This is nothing more than a case of profit-taking,\" said Luiz Sergio Pereira, direc- tor of one of Brazil's biggest coffee-growing unions. Government agencies in Brazil are forecasting a 4-5 per cent increase in the country's coffee harvest this year. The Brazilian coffee sector believes that these figures are mislead- ing, however, as last year's figures may have been a gross underestimate. A severe drought which has hit key cos- fee-growing regions in Brazil has also raised hopes for a surge in international prices. In the central-west of the country, it has not rained for over a month, a factor which could hurt the plants. * The US said it would not help to finance the retention scheme, reports Reuters from Bogota. \"The US Government, as a general policy, is not prepared to finance stocks,\" the US embassy in Bogota said.",

   "text_content" : "Bridget Bloom on the environmentally sensitive areas scheme L AST MONTH, the UK government was accused by conservationists of bad faith: it had promised to defend Britain's rural landscape against the depradations of farmers and developers but had failed to deliver. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, the country's largest indepen- dent conservation group, together with a similar body in Wales and the Council for National Parks, specifically charged the government with failing to honour its many pledges to protect hedgerows, trees and orchards. Such pledges had been made in the much-vaunted Environment White Paper last autumn, as well as by ministers individually over the last five years. Yet, the conservationists said, valuable trees, orchards, woodland and hedges - the last having lost 100,000 miles since 1945 - con- tinued to disappear. In the depths of a recession, when farm- ers' fortunes are flagging badly, such con- servationist demands might seem an eccentric luxury. Yet they illustrate an aspect of a deepening debate on the future of farming and its effect on the environ- ment that farmers cannot easily ignore, for the issue looks like becoming a key part of the wider debate on the reform of Europe's farm policies. The \"green fanning\" debate in the UK currently centres on the future of environ- mentally sensitive areas (ESAs), which are pilot schemes introduced by the govern- ment five years ago specifically to encour- age farmers to protect sensitive land- scapes. But the wider issue is how far public support for agriculture, now based largely on guaranteed prices for farm produce, can or should be shifted in favour of envi- ronmentally-friendly farming. Britain, unhappy at the proposals for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy intro- duced earlier this year by Mr Ray Mac- Sharry, the European Community's agri- culture commissioner, looks like making the running on this question in Brussels when negotiations on the reform package begin in earnest again during the autumn. ESAs, designated in 1986-87, were pio- neer British projects subsequently copied in a few other northern EC member states. The whole thing is so far on a small scale. In Britain, 19 areas, ranging from 350 hect- ares in the Test river valley to nearly 40,000 hectares in the limestone Peak dis- trict, total no more than 2 per cent of Britain's farmland. The budget for the ESAs, at Â£32m over five years, is tiny in comparison with the Â£20bn annual EC farm budget or even with Britain's share of it. In the ESAs Farmers receive grants, based roughly on profits foregone, to farm in more traditional, less intensive ways thus conserving (depending on the area) hedgerows or farm ponds, grass or wet- lands or high chalk downs. The schemes have been relatively popu- i with varying degrees of enthusiasm by all Britain's conservationist organisations as well as by bodies like the National Farm- ers' Union and the Country Landowners r Association. There are, however, consider- able differences of view as to what should Shappen next. The government recently concluded a detailed review of the first five ESAs to be set up in England. At the same time, it has asked the Countryside Commission and English Nature, both government-funded quangos, to recommend on the creation of : new ESAs. much on how much money Mr , John Gummer, the agriculture minister, manages to squeeze out of the Treasury. Improvement to the existing ESAs seem certain. It is likely, for exam- ple, that farmers contracts will be extended to ten rather than the present s five years, that some of the boundaries i will be altered and that some of the condi- tions that worked less well in some ESAs will be toughened. 1 Less sure are new ESAs. Though Mr Gummer himself would certainly like more, he may not get the financial com- mitment so close to the general election to r create enough to make the exercise politi- - cally worthwhile. f However an additional reason for delay i may be the continuing debate over pre- 1 cisely what form public support for green ) farmning should take. 3 Conservationist bodies differ on this. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which has conducted its own 1 detailed review of several of the ESAs, 5 goes furthest in demanding that EC sup- ) port should be made conditional on farm- ers practising environmentally-friendly farming. The RSPB believes that ESAs should be greatly extended, to cover per- I haps 40 per cent of Britain's farmland, but und Ben . a ::; : :h la i ti . . :Â· ^Glense? j Whitlaw/Edon Antrlm Vewa Mourne and AJ Din dales - Slieve Croob North-Reak eyn Canan ) Broads Peni a Mu\"tains J u Breckand .. ShlioP ^ Test valterier West . tetl NSouth :Penw th u: :d moors;: . : Downs it thinks that all farmers should be required to follow certain environmental rules to qualify them to receive EC farm support. In a recent report it argues that the MacSharry farm reform proposals should be recast to ensure this \"cross com- pliance\". Other bodies baulk at going so far. It is hardly surprising that the National Farm- ers' Union and the Country Landowners Association in particular want ESAs and any other new environmental schemes to continue to be voluntary. While the NFU, for example, has accepted, in its advocacy of \"supply management\", that farmers should receive price support provided they withdraw land from production, it is not willing to go so far on environmental cross compliance. The difference is perhaps best illus- trated by comparing the approach of the RSPB and the Countryside Commission, the government's overall adviser on coun- tryside matters. The commission played a key role in initiating the ESAs in the mid- 1980s, and seems certain to recommend that more should be established. However, its officials are now keen to prove the success of a new scheme, intro- duced only in June. The countryside stew- ardship scheme, with funds of Â£13m over three years, is at present seen as experi- mental. Though many of its features and aims seem remarkably similar to ESAs (it aims to restore traditional landscapes by using grants for less intensive farming and for reinstating hedges, walls or woodland) it is seen as much more flexible. In partic- ular, it is not \"site specific\" - virtually any landowner can submit a plan, albeit for the time being only in five types of landscape, which would then be judged as worthy of grants (or not) by the Country- side Commission. Other aspects of the stewardship scheme are also different from ESAs. For example, considerable emphasis is being put on pub- lic access. But perhaps the key to the scheme is that officials hope it could ulti- mately be extended countrywide, though apparently with no sort of formal links with the CAP. Those conservation groups like the RSPB, which would prefer manda- tory environmental schemes, charge that the Countryside Commission is trying to effect a \"sticking-plaster\" solution. They also complain that, apart from being too cautious partly because of its government funding, the commission may be falling prey to rivalry between the Department of the Environment, which is funding the stewardship scheme, and the Agriculture ministry, which is responsible for the ESAs. The debate will, no doubt, continue, as negotiations on CAP reform gather pace. While the \"green\" debate will be an increasingly important ingredient of farm reform, there is clearly still much to play for as governments seek to work out pre- cisely how they will accommodate the con- servationists' demands.",

The announcement follows the disclosure earlier in the week that the Loraine gold mine was cutting back produc- tion in an effort to cut losses. Gengold has already this year announced the closure of the Stilfontein mine and curtail- ment in the development of the Weltevreden mine. Analysts are predicting further cutbacks and closures to be announced. The Winkelhaak project, announced in January 1990, would have allowed the mine to access an area containing 21.4m tonnes of ore which could be mined at a yield of 5.7 grams per tonne to produce a total of 121 tonnes of gold. Pro- duction from the shaft would have commenced in 1998 and run through to 2015. Winkel- haak produced about 13 tonnes of gold in 1990 - 2 per cent of the country's total of 605 tonnes. Gengold says that \"ruling and foreseeable gold prices are substantially below those envisaged when the project was initially approved and are too low for the project in its original form to yield an acceptable rate of return.\"",

   "text_content" : "A SMALLER than expected rise in August US producer prices had little impact on a weak dollar yesterday. The for. eign exchanges are now waiting for today's US con- sumer price index to confirm that inflationary pressure has eased and also for a possible easing of Federal Reserve mon- etary policy. Mr Wayne Angell, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said the US was making progress towards price stability, but declined to make a specific comment about the 0.2 per cent increase in the August PPI. Analysts expected a rise of 0.3 per cent and forecast new applications for weekly unem- ployment benefit of 422,000, but this figure was also slightly lower at 420,000. Today's figures are expected to show that August consumer prices rose at an unchanged 0.2 per cent and that year-on-year inflation fell to 3.8 from 4.4 per cent. The immediate performance of the dollar is likely to depend on the reaction of the Federal Reserve. A cut in the Federal funds target level of 5% per cent is likely to have more impact than a reduction in the 5% per cent US discount rate. At the London close the dol- lar had fallen to DM1.6855 from DM1.6970; to Y134.05 from Y134.90; to SFrl.4770 from SFr1.4860; and to FFr5.7425 from FFr5.7725. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined to 65.0 from 653. Sterling gained more than % cent against the dollar but lost ground to its partners in the European exchange rate mech- anism. A year-on-year rise of 7.5 per cent in UK average earnings during July was below esti- mates of 8.0 per cent and according to dealers was a sig- nificant pointer towards a fall in the underlying level of infla- tion. The June figure was revised down to 8.0 from 8.25 per cent. This increased specu- lation about lower UK bank base rates, leaving the pound weaker in the ERM. Fading expectations of a UK general election this year mean that the political risk in hold- ing the currency could increase during the winter at a time when the differential between UK and German inter- est rates has already narrowed sharply. Sterling rose 80 points to 81.78335, but fell to DM2.9225 from DM2.9275; to FFr9.9550 from FFr9.9600; to SFr2.5600 from SFr25650; and to Y232.25 from Y232.75. The pound's index was unchanged through- out at 91.2. Despite its general decline against the major European currencies sterling remained the third weakest currency in the ERM, above the Danish krone and French franc. The peseta eased slightly, but stayed the highest cur- rency in the ERM, showing lit- tle reaction to an unchanged Spanish year-on-year inflation rate of 6.0 per cent. Dealers said it is unlikely that the Bank of Spain will cut its money market intervention rate, the main instrument of credit policy, at today's repur- chase agreement tender.",

   "text_content" : "Wall Street GOOD NEWS on inflation raised hopes of an interest rate cut and helped share prices post healthy gains yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.80 at 3,007.83, after a burst of last minute buying helped the index breach the 3,000 mark. The more broadly based Stan- dard & Poors 500 was also firmer, up 2.25 at 387.34, while the Nasdaq composite of over- the-counter stocks outper- formed the other main indices with a gain of 6.37 to 521.13. Volume on the NYSE was 161m shares, with rises outnumber- ing declines by 945 to 600. After several days in the dol- drums, the market got a wel- come boost from news of a 0.2 per cent rise in August pro- ducer prices. The figure was lower than expected, and prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve would cut the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5 per cent. However, analysts said they thought it more likely that the central bank would not ease until it had seen the August consumer prices numbers, due today. Even then the Fed might still wait a few more lays before easing, because it would not want to be seen to have reacted too quickly to one set of economic data.

US Healthcare, an over-the counter stock, jumped $3% to $27% after regulators in the state of New Jersey approved the company's request for a 16 per cent increase on its insur- ance premium rates. Digital Systems plummeted $6%, or over 40 per cent, to $9%'/ on a warning from the company that third-quarter profits would fall to between 9 cents a share and 13 cents a share, compared with 26 cents a share a year ago. Canada TORONTO share prices ended almost where they started, in moderate trading. The composite index rose 7.85 to 3,437.59 as declines led advances by 288 to 260. Volume fell to 22.2m shares from the previous 25.1m shares and trading value was C$252.8m against C$270.9m. Maple Leaf Foods said it plans to sell 15.1m common shares at C$15 each. The stock fell C$% to C$15%. VenTech Healthcare, which has about 18.7m outstanding shares, said it will issue 29.4m to acquire North West Estates plc, a private United Kingdom land- development concern.",

One dealer said, however, that the market was still waiting for an interest rate cut. The CAC 40 index rose 18.61 or 1 per cent to 1,861.17 in turn- over of FFr2.5bn, up from FFrl.56bn. Among active blue chips, Peugeot gained FFrl2 to FFr612, Lyonnaise des Eaux- Dumez added FFr7 to FFr552 and Alcatel-Alsthom rose FFr8 to FFr595. CMB Packaging reached a day's high of FFr156 before closing FFrl.20 up at FFr152.20, after first-half results and the departure of the chairman. Cerus rose another FFr2.40 to FFr133.40 in heavy volume of 343,150 shares on continued speculation that it will sell Banque Dumnnil Lebld, while Chargeurs jumped FFr47 or 5.4 per cent to FFr917 on rumours that BSkyB, in which it holds 15.9 per cent, will become prof- itable sooner than expected. STOCKHOLM was boosted by better-than-expected August inflation data, which showed that the annual rate had fallen to 8.4 per cent from 9.3 per cent in July. The news sent domes- tic interest rates sharply lower. The Affarsviirlden General index rose 8.9 to 1,094.4 in turn- over of SKr453m after SKr356m. Incentive, which met domestic analysts recently, saw its free Bs rise SKr6 to SKr200. MADRID was encouraged by a fall in the one-year Treasury bill yield and an inflation fig- ure for August in line with expectations. The general index added 1.41 to 271.32 as FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Sep 12 Hourly changes Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1 pm 2 pm 3 pm Close 1110.85 1111.42 1111.48 1111.73 1112.17 1113.68 1119.41 1117.77 Day's High 1119.86 Day's Low 1110.66 Sep 11 Sep 10 Sep 9 Sep 6 Sep 5 1111.14 1112.84 1116.88 1124.68 1126.92 Base value 1000 (26110/0). turnover rose to about PtalObn from Pta7bn. . Cepsa, the oil refiner, was requoted and rose Pta40 to Pta2,270, following Wednes day's suspension. Elf Aquitaine of France is offering Pta2,400 a share for a further 13.5 per cent of Cepsa, which would raise its stake to 34 per cent. FRANKFURT heard Mr Jiir gen Mollemann, the German Economics Minister, warn oi the dangers of a price-wage spi- ral. However, there were slightly more signs of life as the DAX index closed 3.13 higher at 1,631.32, after a 1.03 fall to 674.59 in the FAZ at mid- session, and volume rose from DM3.5bn to DM4.2bn. The momentum was not all positive. Siemens and its Nixdorf (SNI) offshoot dropped DM7.20 to DM654.80, and DM9.80 to DM230 respectively, on a report that SNI would show a DMlbn loss this year. However, according to Mr Ian Macleod, technology analyst at County NatWest, Siemens expects to maintain its forecast of slightly higher profits for the year ending this month. Elsewhere, retailers were mostly higher, inspired by Kaufhof, which put on another DM8 to DM951.50 as estimates circulated of a profits rise of between 50 and 70 per cent this year. In construction, Hochtief and Holzmann fell DM40 to DM1,275, and DM34 to DM1,295, on Monday's survey by Iso, the economic research institute, which said that industry out- put growth would slow to 1 per cent next year and that the order backlog, would decline. MILAN weakened further as investors abandoned their monthly options ahead of next week's close of the September trading account. There were fears that this month's settle- ment could be late as a result of the delay in August settle- ment. The Comit index fell 1.21 to 540.91 in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's LSObn. Banking and insurance shares fell, with Credito Itali- ano down 2.7 per cent or L70 at L2,555 and Banca Commerciale Italiana off L35 at L4,695. The cement sector saw a late recovery. Cementir, which is due to be privatised in full, closed down L2 at L2,595 but then rose to L2,705 after hours. AMSTERDAM closed slightly higher, encouraged by a higher opening on Wall Street. The CBS tendency index gained 0.1 to 92.2. Elsevier, the publisher, rose F11.80 to F187.40 on for- eign demand, but Royal Dutch fell Fl1 to Fl 156.30 in spite of announcing a rise in its first- half 1991 dividend. OSLO was supported by the shipping sector. The all-share index rose 2.89 to 505.85 in turnover of NKr250m. Norsk Data A shares added NKr0.5 to NKr9.5. The com- puter company reported a first- half loss and 500 job cuts. VIENNA fell for the third consecutive day in quiet trad- ing. The ATX index lost 12.62 or 1.1 per cent to 1,112.45.",

   "text_content" : "Philip Gawith reports on the growing divergence between two prominent JSE sectors OLD'S recent inability to perform in times of uncertainty has been reflected in the divergence between two prominent sectors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). During last month's failed Soviet coup, for example, the industrial index barely paused before resuming its uptrend, but gold shares continued to slide. The JSE industrial index closed yesterday at 4,218, not far off Tuesday's record high of 4,237 and 49 per cent above its 1991 low of 2,829 in January. Golds closed at 1,139, down 22.5 per cent from the 1991 peak of 1,469 set early in July. On Wednesday the index lost 5 per cent as bullion prices plunged to five-year lows on reports of secret Soviet gold sales. The market capitalisation of gold shares has fallen 12.1 per cent to R45.8bn ($16bn) in the year to June. By contrast, the market capitalisation of the industrial sector has risen 28.3 per cent to R224.9bn in the same period. At the end of June, golds accounted for only m.o per cent oi me troua marxer capitalisation, down from 12.6 per cent one year earlier, while industrials made up 47.9 per cent, up from 42.3 per cent. The strength of industrial shares is a case of the market discounting the next economic recovery, boosted by the coun- try's gradual return into the international fold, rather than a reflection of current business sentiment. According to Mr Karel de Ridder, of Southern Life, the life insurance com- pany: \"Business confidence is neutral at best. The market is not telling us anything about what is going on out there in the economy.\" The message in the real economy is mixed. The country has been in recession for more than two years, with fixed-in- vestment companies and small businesses the hardest hit. Although there is evidence that the recession has bot- tomed out, consumer price inflation remains stubbornly high, at 15.8 per cent. A cut in interest rates, therefore, is likely to come later than antici- Johannesburg Indices rebased 150 130^ Industrial' 1 . . . B. I.. . 120 110 1 : : . ............. . . ...... .... . .... 100 90 ii> J 1991 S SourcD atastream pated and any business upswing, at least initially, will have to do without the benefit of falling interest rates. This leads Mr Graham Boyd, of stockbrokers Simpson McKie, to speculate that the market may be taking the cyni- cal view that, if the economy fails to revive of its own accord, the government will have to get it going. Evidence to support this thesis comes in the form of a sustained rise in real government expenditure this year, with further spend- ing likely to exert upward pres- sure on inflation. Over the past decade, equi- ties have been the best hedge against inflation in South Africa, compared with property or fixed-income investments. So support for share prices is conceivable, even at the cur- rent demanding levels. Mr Boyd says industrial shares are looking tired, but although they appear to be too expen- sive to buy, few investors are willing to sell. This is evident in the low turnover in market leaders. Although industrials appear expensive, analysts believe that future earnings will vali- date current ratings, even if a prolonged monetary squeeze causes the economic upturn to be milder than originally antic- ipated. There is no such optimism about gold shares; their low ratings reflect difficult times and little hope of an early recovery. Mr John Clemmow, of stockbrokers George Huysa- mer, says the gold price and gold shares reflect \"a huge amount of disillusionment\". A few months ago, brokers believed that gold shares were entering a bull phase, bolstered by reports that South African gold producers had unwound some of their forward posi- tions, which should have sup- ported the bullion price. The rot set in when a recov- ery in the gold price petered out in June. The absence of money flowing into the pre- cious metal during the Soviet coup was further evidence that gold is increasingly regarded as a commodity and not as a safe-haven investment during times of turmoil. Mr Clemmow sees little fun- damental value in South Afri- can gold shares, since the world gold supply is not declin- ing in spite of talk to the con- trary. Furthermore, there is lit- tle chance that the gold price will rise, in view of the signifi- cant gold bullion sales by cen- tral banks and the risk of a Soviet sell-off."

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney SHARES IN Commonwealth Bank of Australia closed at A$6.46 on the first day of trad- ing on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday, a pre- mium of A$1.06 over last month's flotation price. The exchange said more than 10.6m Commonwealth shares had been traded, push- ing total market volume to more than 95m shares - one of the busiest days since the global stock markets crash in October 1987. Brokers said the excitement of the Commonwealth listing, combined with better than expected unemployment fig- ures for August, triggered hec- tic buying of other stocks. Mr Ian McKenzie, a director of Day Cutten Pring Dean, said: \"It was fantastic. It had a tremendous effect on the mar- ket\" The All Ordinaries index closed 8.1 higher at 1,569.1 in turnover of A$258m (USS203m), up from A$168m. Commonwealth shares opened at A$6.40, watched by dozens of small stockholders who had bought shares in the A$1.3bn flotation of just under 30 per cent of the bank. Technically, the first trade was at A$6.90, but brokers said later that the deal had been specially set up for a small investor, who was will- ing to pay a premium to be the first on-market purchaser of Commonwealth shares. Mr Don Sanders, Common- wealth managing director, said the listing heralded a new era in public banking, and forecast that most of the 200,000 small investors who own shares in the bank were \"in for the long haul\". Commonwealth's flotation, Australia's biggest, followed its A$1.6bn takeover of the State Bank of Victoria. The state bank had incurred losses through its Tricontinental merchant banking subsidiary. The flotation was oversub- scribed by A$600m. Earlier this week, Common- wealth announced a fall of 45 per cent in net profits for the year to the end of June. Elsewhere in the market yesterday, Coles Myer, the retailer, gained 20 cents to A$10.70 after reporting a rise in annual net profits.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES ended slightly higher yesterday, as buying by foreigners absorbed arbitrage- related selling ahead of the set- tlement of September futures contracts, writes Emiko Tera- zono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 25.41 points at 22,530.20 after reaching a high of 22,722.55 and a low of 22,504.89. Sharp falls in short-term inter- est rates and a firmer yen prompted buying in the morn- ing, but selling by arbitrageurs cut initial gains. Volume expanded to 430m shares from 400m on buying by foreigners. Gains led losses by 494 to 470, with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 0.22 to 1,748.58, and in London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 11.38 to 1,331.43. Price movements were vola- tile because of the arbitrage-re- lated activity. Traders said the Nikkei average could drop by as much as 500 points today on arbitrage-linked trading, although they expected institu- tional investors to support share prices by picking up cheaper issues. The settlement price for September futures is determined by the opening prices of the 225 index compo- nent stocks. Those that are forecast to be removed from the 225-share index are expected to fall sharply. Mr Masami Okuma of UBS Phillips &Drew said that up to six component stocks could be reshuffled next month. Shipping issues were traded actively by foreigners, sup- ported by expectations of a global recovery in the indus- try. Ishikawajima-Harima Industries rose Y5 to Y710 and Mitsui Engineering & Ship- building gained Y9 to Y609. Speculative issues were pop- ular from a short-term perspec- tive. Clarion, a speculative favourite, surged Y200 to Y1,440 and Kurabo Industries Y46 to Y941. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was concerned about the activity, later announced that it would tighten margin trading requirements for Clar- ion. Collateral on margin trad- ing was raised from 30 per cent of the issue's market value to 50 per cent. Plant engineers were firm on speculation that companies would begin plant exports to the Soviet Union following improvement in Japan-Soviet relations. Chiyoda rose Y90 to Y2,030 and Toyo Engineering added Y30 at Y1,370. Fisheries also gained ground on the Soviet theme, after Soviet government officials indicated that they were ready to negotiate the return of the Kurile Islands, to the north of Japan. Nippon Suisan climbed Y39 to Y615. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 149.48 to 24,972.07 on volume of 53.4m shares, down from 80.2m. Nippon Dentsukensetsu, the telephone installation com- pany, advanced Y52 to Y888 on its earnings estimates. The company is expected to report a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the current year on new projects from Nippon Tele- graph and Telephone. Roundup PACIFIC RIM markets were lit- tle changed yesterday. MANILA recovered a small part of this week's sharp losses, the composite index ral- lying 6.74 to 902.02. Trading was volatile ahead of the Phil- ippine Senate's vote on the US military bases on Monday. Turnover picked up to 162m pesos from 139m. HONG KONG firmed in another day of light trading. The Hang Seng index rose 3.17 to 3,970.10 as turnover declined to HK$908m from HK$985m. SEOUL fell on worries about tight liquidity. The composite index lost 7.40 to 683.31 as turn- over shrank to Wonl84bn from Won387bn. NEW ZEALAND slipped as the local dollar reached four- month highs. The NZSE-40 index receded 7.86 to 1,410.15 in turnover of NZ$19m, up from NZ$14m.",

Much the same as you no doubt Jancis Robinson has been knocking back cheap reds in the south of France and discovers some excellent bargains for under Â£3 a bottle. Roger Mear, armed with just a bar of Kendal mint cake and a rucksack, braved the 'death zone' of the world's ninth highest mountain. Is it time for savers to lock in to fixed rates? Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu crunch the numbers. The sun rises next week on The Japanese Festival in Britain. FT critics pick the best from an immense variety of sporting and cultural events. That warm feeling: Lucia van der Post on how to look good in the autumn mists. Plus: are you a hunk or a wimp?

   "text_content" : "vB Terrv Bviand. UK Stock Market Editor CORPORATE developments having depressed the UK stoc market earlier this week, carm to its rescue yesterday. Wit the British Aerospace right issue and profits collapse no out of the way, equitie responded favourably to goc results and a share split fron Glaxo, the international phar maceuticals group which i widely held by the globa investment funds. The chief economic featun of the day was the disclosure o a substantial fall in UK aver age earnings in July, whic supported optimistic views o domestic inflation and there fore on interest rate pressure: There was further pressui on British Aerospace as th analysts from the brokerag houses and the investmer press delivered the expectedl ngm om g d Sep 2 Sep 16 p 30 sop 12 Sp 2 Oct 10 Sep 13 Sep 27 Oct 11 AOMeMi DSe Sep 23 Oct 7 Oct 21 bearish comments on the results and fund-raising pro posals. Institutional interest in equi- ties remained high, and market volume, as measured by the Seaq network, increased to 460.6m shares from the 410.3m recorded on Wednesday. Although retail interest, dis- closed in Stock Exchange offi- cial data, indicates that overall customer business is still below the Â£lbn daily levels regarded as the sign of a flnan- cially healthy market, there were further indications yes- terday that the big investment funds were switching stock rather than selling. The FT-SE Index gained more than 21 points in early trading but shied away as it approached the 2,650 mark. In spite of a firm opening on Wall Street, which was moving close to the Dow 3,000 level in early trading, London closed off the top, with the FT-SE finally at 2,641.9 for a gain of 15.3 on the day. The futures market led the underlying cash equity market for much of the session, and at the close the Footsie future still showed a significant pre- mium against cash value - the estimated premium which allows for financial carrying costs and impending dividend flows on the underlying FT-SE stocks. Also significant in early trading was the evident unwinding of the programme trade which surfaced at the close of trading on the previ- ous day. Glaxo was the star turn of the market as the improved results provided the backcloth for the bonus issue to share- holders, which will reduce the share price and thus render the shares more marketable, a pos- itive development for a share already in the centre of market attention. Other blue chip internation- als remained relatively depressed behind a weakish US dollar, although losses recorded in ICI and British Petroleum shares were trifling. Among the dull spots wa RTZ, which gave ground im heavy trading on the news of sharp fall in profits. Rolls Royce closed easier after thi trading statement. Cadbur Schweppes, however, made iun ther progress as hopes of takeover bid from across th Atlantic gathered pace. Views on UK equities amon the London based investmeni houses remained bullish, although Smith New Cour suggested that funds might I overweight in London share after investors had \"finall woken up to the inherent valu in this market\". Mr Robi Aspinall at Schroders believe the weakness of the last feu days is \"entirely consistep with\" a routine correctio within an upward trend to target of FT-SE 2,780.",

   "text_content" : "GLAXO more than made up for its losses over the two previous trading sessions after announc- ing a 9 per cent rise in interim profits, a 27 per cent increase in the dividend and a one-for- one share split. The established bulls of the stock reiterated their long-term confidence in the company. Mr Paul Krikler at Goldman Sachs said: \"Zantac (the world's big- gest selling drug) is still grow- ing and we have seen impor- tant new products, such as Zofran, already coming through.\" Mr Robin Gilbert at James Capel acknowledged the strengths of the company but argued that a 30 per cent rise in R & D spending underlined the fact that Glaxo needed to develop new products quickly. The shares forged ahead 47 to 1068p, a gain described by analysts as \"overdone\" and \"likely to lead to further short term strength\". Turnover, at 4.5m, was the highest for a month. ScotPower demand Scottish Power, a poor per- former since its June flotation at 100p, easily topped the list of active stocks with 26m shares traded. The stock ran up to 110p before closing 3 ahead at 109%p. Dealers said investment bank BZW was behind the heavy trading and good rise. They added that it was an aggressive buyer of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro- Electric, and was thought to be preparing a positive note on both stocks for publication next week. Scottish Hydro held at 114p on 2.7m. BZW profits estimates for the Scottish generators are thought to be at the top end of the market range. Racal excitement A burst of intense activity in Racal 'Special Ex' shares ahead of Monday's demerger of Racal Telecom from Racal Electronics led to more stories that the demerged Racal Elec- tronics may be attracting a stakebuilder. There was also speculation that a predator, having accu- mulated a big stake in the 'Spe- cial Ex', may launch a full bid on Monday. BTR, Thorn EMI and Mannesmann, of Germany, possible suitors for Racal. Racal 'Special Ex' closed 2 up at 45%/p after 12m shares traded. Since they were offi- cially listed last week the stock has risen from around 34p with turnover reaching more than 120m shares, equivalent to about 10 per cent of Racal Elec- tronics' capital. Another theory behind the very heavy turnover is that marketmakers have been run- ning large straddle or arbitrage positions in the three Racal stocks, hoping to unwind these at a profit on the demerger. Mr Brian Newman of Hen- derson Crosthwaite, who puts a break-up value of 60p on Racal Electronics, said that at current market prices Racal is valued at Â£630m. That makes it the second largest electronics group in the UK after GEC. Rolls-Royce relief Turnover in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce rose to 13m, and the shares firmed 2%/ to 142%p on speculation of an engine order and relief that the company's poor interim fig- ures were not worse. The prof- its fall, from Â£115m to Â£llm, was within the range of market forecasts. There was also speculation that Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong based international air- liner, would soon place an engine order with Rolls-Royce. Analysts reduced full-year profits expectations from above Â£100m. County NatWest and Charterhouse Tilney pencilled in Â£85m. UBS Phillips& Drew was more cautious, going for Â£67m, but Mr Paul Compton at UBS said: \"Rolls is a classic cyclical company that should make f275m in 1993.\" British Aerospace dropped a further 24 to 421p, with the shares still considered a risk following Wednesday's poor results and rights issue. Turn- over came to 4m. The long anticipated rights issue for Hickson International finally came through yester- day. The chemicals group announced that it intended to raise Â£70m by offering shares at 160p on a two-for-five basis. Although the cash call was forecast before the interim results in mid-August, observ- ers expressed surprise that the share price rose so sharply, closing 10 up at 214p. They pointed out that doubts about liquidity may have been removed but a lot of faith was being placed in future per- formance. Nevertheless, the explana- tory meeting with analysts was said to be upbeat and securi- ties house Kleinwort Benson left it to take a fresh look at its forecast for the company. The 150p-a-share bid for Sov- ereign Oil & Gas prompted a jump of 40 to 143p and trig- gered a flurry of speculative buying in related stocks. Asked if the bid might trigger more takeovers and set the cat among the pigeons in the sub- sector, a leading analyst replied: \"One pigeon does not make a summer, according to the bears.\" Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court said the bid \"will go a long way in restoring confi- dence in asset values\". Clyde rose 4 to 101p, Goal 3 to 60p and Hardy 6 to 179p. Cable and Wireless advanced 8 to 579p after a profits upgrade by Hoare Govett. Mr Jim Ross at Hoare increased his current year forecast from",

Hoare maid Mercury, C and W's tele- :oms subsidiary, was doing much better than expected. Bid speculation surrounding Cadbury Schweppes intensified as a US newspaper reported that American analysts believe Philip Morris, the food and tobacco group, could launch a bid. Cadbury shares added 15 at 419p, with further support coming from the traded tptions market, where a US broker was said to have been buying in-the-money calls, a close substitute for stock. Other companies on which Philip Morris may be casting its acquisitive eye include Allied Lyons, up 6 at 612p, United Biscuits, 6 higher at 106p, and Grand Metropolitan, 10 stronger at 837p. Asda rose 4 to 10l3p as buy- ing on the inter-broker dealer market lifted turnover to 8.1m. Traders said there was renewed speculation that a senior boardroom appointment was about to be made. There were also hopes that the annual meeting next Wednes- day could bring better news on current trading. But there were fears that a sustained rise in the shares could trigger a rights issue. Rosehaugh and Stanhope were hit hard as the appear- ance of an early seller rekin- dled fears that the companies' proposed merger would be abandoned. Some traders expected an announcement this morning. Others felt talks between the two were likely to continue for some time. Rosehaugh fell 6 to 22p, its lowest for more than five years. USM-quoted Stan- hope retreated 3 to 33p. Pearson moved ahead 13 to 768p as the company continued its series of presentations to US institutions. Textile and engineering group William Baird slipped 9 to 263p on the back of half-time results. The fall in profits was expected and the dividend was maintained, but the com- pany said it saw no sign of \"a sustained improvement\". Carr Kitcat & Aitken reduced its full-year forecast for the com- pany by Â£1.5m to Â£29m and changed its stance from buy to hold. Sirdar picked up 9 to 76p on encouraging interims. W. Canning, the specialty electronics and components group, declined 5 to 137p on poor first-half profits. Cannon Street Investments shrugged off a slump in interim profits and climbed 6 to 89p. The market was relieved that the dividend was maintained and one observer said the figures signalled \"light at the end of the tunnel\" for a company whose shares stood at 400p in 1987. USM-quoted funeral director Great Southern Group saw support on strong interim results and put on 4 to 215p, also benefiting from a Hoare Govett buy recommendation.

   "text_content" : "THE MORE hopeful mood on the stock market found an echo in traded options, where Scottish Power, Glaxo, Asda and Cadbury Schweppes all benefited from increased activ- ity in their underlying securi- ties, writes Jim McCallum. Scottish Power led the way, with share turnover rising to 26m as a broker's buy note pulled in a large amount of Institutional interest. This .aMll.A narr iasn nnnvnua where a buyer of 2,100 Decem- c ber 120 calls and a seller of the ti same amount of December 130 I calls appeared. This transaction matched b the feeling among equity mar- a ket dealers that Scottish A Power could be set to trade tl between 120p and 180p. The 1 Scottish Power share price closed better at 109%p. C A share split and dividend a increase from Glaxo created b interest in its September 1350 c calls. There was also a closing trade in September 1200 and 1300 puts. Speculation about a senior boardroom appointment attracted a seller of 1,000 Asda January 110 calls, while there were buyers of October 100 calls. Takeover speculation in Cadbury Schweppes drew in some in-the-money call buyers, but November 330, 390 and 460 calls were the busiest series."
