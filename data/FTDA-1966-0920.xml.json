   "text_content" : "From Our Diplomatic Correspondent SALISBURY. Sept. 19. The \"battle of protocol,\" which last night delayed the Journey to Salisbury of Mr. Herbert Bowden (Common. wealth Secretary) and Sir Elwyn Jones (AttorneyGeneral), continule hee today as Mr. Smith sent Lord Graham, his Defence Minier, and Mr. C. N. NWe.stmore, Seretay for External Afars, to meet the British Ministers' aircraft. The heaviest security arrangements ever seen in Salisbury had been mounted. But there was no demonstra- tion of any sort at the airport, and the U.K. Ministers were whisked away to Government House, where they are to be the guests of the Governor of Rhodesia, Sir Humphrey Gibbs. Clearly, Mr. Smith intends to stick firmly to his insist- ence that this week's talks are to be between \" Government and Government.\" Although the Rhodesian Premier did not elaborate on yesterday's statement, be told Parliament to-day that he had no intention of declaring Rhodesia a republic at this stage,. Mr. Smith to-day saw Sir Morrice James, Deputy Under- Secretary at the Commonwealth Relations Office, who has been in Salisbury since last Tuesday having talks with Sir Humphrey Gibbs. Their conversation, at wvich Mr. John Hennings, the head of the Sritish Residual Mission in Salis- bury was present, took place at Mr. Smith's residence and lasted 45 minutes. At Blantyre, Malawi, where his aircraft made a brief stop-over. Mr. Herbert Bowden said be could 40t yet say whether he would see Mr. ib. He and Sir Elwy at tbr visit woul la hoat to a wide sectiono the \"Ou<r Cards ,on the 'able\" : Bowden Mr. Bowden added that: M. Smith represented a large body of Rhodesian opinion and he hoped that he might see him. \" We a- putting our cards on the table and showing them the colour of our money. Sir Humphrey Gibbs to-day issued a statement in which he welcomed the arrival of the British mission and expressed his \" arnemi hope's that the visit would lead to an early and honourable settle rent of our constitutional difficul' in his statement to Parliament arlier in the afternoon, Mr. Smith frmly knocked on the head the ersistent speculation here that his .overnment Is about to declare Rhodesia a republic. A stron move to introduce a republic has been expected at the Rhodesian Front Congress in Bulawayo at the end of this week. Not on Agenda says Smith Mr, Smith said to-day this was not on our agenda \" and \"not a erious questlon.\" However, he Irt himself free to take actlon ater by adding a somewhat mysterious warning that the matter could be taken out of his hands if Rhodesia were expelled from the Commonwealth - whatever thai may mean. He also said a mandate from the people would be needed before such a step could be taken, pors sibly through a referendum. It is thought that Mr. Smith has stood firm against the growing body of opinion in his Party on this question because he is keenly aware of the strain that declaring a republic would put upon those Rhodesians who have sworn an oath of allegiance to the Crown- particularly senior army and police officers. At present a con. venient fiction is maintained of \"the Queen of Rhodesia.\" White Rhodesians have made ubilant capital of the fact-gence ly accepted here, however much it s denied in London-that the arrival of Mr. Bowden carries with t substantial recognition of the Rhodesian regine. Most people dismiss with amuse ment the re t4 ..Whitehall opinion that thrtaaare in no way a stiri of negotiations and imply no recognition of Mr. Smits Government. However, they are also baffled as to what Mr. Bowden can conceivably achieve. - No one here has seen a sign of an opening which could lead to an agreement, and there would be asonishment if Mr. Smith were to allow Mr. Bowden to meet \"all sections of opinion \"-for example, the restricted African leaders. Report of Secret Meeting On the other .hand, thee point must presumabl have been borne in mind when Mr. Bowden's visit Was arranged-which was prob. ably last Friday night when, It Ia reported. Sir Morrice James met Mr. Smith in secret. The innificance and importance of Mr. Bowden's visit is obvious, but he is unlikely to be the subject of popular attention, as were Mr. Vlson and Mr. Bottomley last art. The reason for this i that Rhodeslans are limply not vMry interested In thepresent Ithnki or actions of the British Oovern .nt, This may be because they are \"punchdrunk,\" but it is more likely that they are both bored and complacent Mr. Smith himself may as ,ither, but there is no reasn to think he is under any partcular risure at th present tme whioh nlht ll m to mae aI com. iromÂ»ie with Mr itowden, ,n.-,ww .,, %,w,,w nuu Iuvw nw promnl wlry Mr. HOWCia Labour' Rhodelsi polecy, Page 18",

   "text_content" : "By LEX In tiny turnover equities made a little pgound yesterday and the index closed a point to the good at 306.6. [CI's demands may account partly for the lack of business. But whatever the reason it does not apply to gilts. Once again they completely overshadowed equities, there was a good level of busi- ness with the banks switching into mediums and rises throughout the list. The longs tended to lag a little with increases of up to % but then the long tap, price unchanged at 84Y, must have had a hand in that. Since the switch from mediums into the long tap dominates the scene at the moment presumably it will not be long be- fore more stock is seen in the mediums. This together with the fact that the market has had a good rise since the middle of last week may point to a mild tech- nical reaction developing to shake out some of the bulls. Investment Trusts With the investment dollar premium back to 16% per cent., al/ Street frayed at the edge, and the U.K. market down almost a fifth, investment trusts have had a poor time of it lately. And though they have not outpaced the market, the discount on assets has stayed put at 5-10 per cent, the setback has been fast enough to make sure it was not particularly discriminating. At one point last week Industrial and General with sub-normal gearing and a reason- able yield had dropped as quickly as Fundinvest with no yield and super gearing, though there ha eews a parting of the ways since. But not all the anomalies have disappeared. For example, it is hardto see why British Assets which has bounced up from 1 s 9d to 13s d, should yield only 4.2 per nt, ust .covered by earnings when he average yield for trusts is 4% per cent. covered nearly IV t~. On the other tack Phiip Hil Iivestment Trust ias now sunk'tIk st 3d -bove its lcw point f * the year st 14s 10%d to yield 3,7 I~n cent., covered 1.1 tmes. rsistent mAl selling seems one a1wer to this performance sinc he assets' discount is now well above average, a is the yield. In more general terms the trusts will be more willing to liquidate heir U.S. holdings with the premium down. Moreover they must be reaching the point where the question will arise whether the outlook Is better in the U.K. than U.S., particularly if franked income o cover the dividend is in short supply. Certainly the signs are that switching is gathering way again. Whereas In the first three. quarters of 1965 the trusts were net sellers of U.K. equities to the tune of Â£14.7,. In the following nine months they were net buyers of \"2,3m. Naturally the overseas holdtgs, prIneially in the U.S ave followed th reverse course. 0d sales In the latest quarter (March-June, 1966), rose to Â£10m. net against Â£4.1m. in the previous six months. Cawoods Though down, Cawoods' second half profits are slightly better than expected to give Â£1.2m. for the year against Â£1.4m. before tax. Earnings after a straight tax charge are 25.9 per cent. and the dividend is effec- tively unchanged at 22% per cent. Part of the trouble was the fuel side where profits fell from Â£914,000 to Â£865,000, but the real weak link was building materials. Profits from quarrying and ready- mixed concrete are down from Â£442,500 to Â£324.000 and in the rest of the building side the drop is from Â£128,000 to Â£72,000. This leaves the share price at 15s 3d, up Is l4d, yielding 7% per cent. and seing at 11.6 times earnings. The yield provides the comfort in the short term but the p/e ratio compares with under 10 times for Cory or Powell Duffryn. The differential depends, of course, on Cawoods' spread but it is hard to see this being much of an advan. tage in the short term when SET will cost Â£120,000 and while profits in the first four months are already \"slightly lower.\" But there is more to the group than that. For one thing the loss makers-refractories and civil engi- neering-should be sorted out in the next year or two, secondly the fuel side has still to benefit from its half-share in the Ferrybridge contract while oil supplies are largely taken care of in long term contracts. Finally though the group will be coming to the market for new capital, at least it has scope for further gearing. There is room for more unsecured loan stock and even better, with the institutions getting choosey about the prior charges they will support, there are freehold buildings and land in the balanc hsheet worth Â£1.4m. at book valht, uncharged and last valued over tea years ago. See also Page 13 MIrily Tile Marley Tile's third quarter figures are a lot better than the previous two. After short-falls of 31-and then 46 per cent, third quarter profits are only 11% per cent. down at Â£974,000 to make a nine months total of Â£2.17m. against Â£3m. before tax. This puts Marley back in the race to cover its dividend this year, but it will have to pull off a final quarter very nearly as good as last year's to hit the necessary Â£3.2m. or so before tax. It is true building demand is less sticky than it was last winter, and sales are still rising, but margins are the real problem and it is hard to see Marley producing a solution in time. Its latest attempts to diversify away from tiles into tufted carpets has not yet reached the production stage. Nonetheless at 16s 9d to yield 6 per cent. is taking the dividend for granted.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Editor INTERNATIONAL NICKEL'S costly new three-year labour con- tract, which ended the strike at its Ontario properties over the week- end, raises doubts as to how long nickel can stay at its present price of Â£642 a ton-a level which has been maintained since May, 1962. A great deal of production was lost in the Ontario region through a three-week-long strike which ended on August 8, and the same is true of the strike just settled, which started on September 12. The labour disputes came at a time of booming demand for nickel, with the producers hard put to satisfy the needs of their customers. The industry, led by International Nickel and Falcon- bridge, is investing heavily in new productive capacity, but it will be some considerable time before supply.is properly in balance with demand again. Furthermore, there is little nickel available from the U.S. General Services Administration's stockpile to alleviate the situation. International Nickel's new con- tract, agreed with the United Steelworkers of America, covers 18,000 hourly-paid employees in its Ontario operations. It provides a wage and fringe benefit package, slightly in excess of 85 cents an hour, of which 60 cents is in wage increases. The contract also provides for greater pension benefits, extended vacations and increased company payments to life, medical and sick- ness insurance. A new incentive bonus plan has also been created. Mr. Henry S. Wingate. chairman, said that the settlement terms were necessary in the light of the existing Canadian pattern of wage and labour settlements. He pointed out that the settlement would have an imme- diate effect on overall costs. \"The agreement calls for a 25 pe cent. increase i gnwagesp vr three years, with approxi e 15 per cent. increase coming tsthe first year of the contract. It is clear, as we expected from the beginning, that, because of this agreement and others in Canada, our labour and associated costs will rise very ntarkedl in the future.\" Mr. Wingate added that be was pleased that the agreement had been reached. It is, of course. vital to our customers and everybody con. cerned that we resume the full-scale production of nickel, which is presently in short supply. \"The bargaining period has resulted in serious losses in produc- tion and curtailment of deliveries to our customers. It is our objective to return to normal production as soon as possible. \"At the same time, the company is moving ahead on a very large capital expenditure programme in Canada and pressing to develop new production facilities in Canada, the U.S. and other nations.\"",

   "text_content" : "A FURTHER WARNING to the Government about the detrimental effects of foreign imports on Britain's horticultural industry was given by Mr. E. H. Gardener, chairman of the National Farmers' Union's Central Horticultural Committee, at a Press conference in London yesterday. Announcing a series of nine con- ferences to be held this autumn arranged jointly by the NFU, the National Agricultural Advisory Ser- vice of the Ministry of Agriculture. and the Electricity Council, to encourage modernisation of glass- houses, Mr. Gardener referred to the recent rejection by the Government of the NFU's case for an increase in the duty on cucumbers. There had been great developments in glasshouse production leading to increased production of crops, par- ticularly tomatoes and cucumbers. 'This has involved a great deal of money and it means that growers require a reasonable assurance for the future. If you invest large sums of mon4y in afodernising, you do not want the value of your crops under. mined by imports from countries where costs of production are much lower and which may wreck your markets,\" he said. \"The import of cucumbers has risen from Â£t.3m. in 1961 to nearly Â£3m. last year.\" Mr. Bryan Meering, of Herts., chairman of the NFU Glasshouse Production Committee, said that because of the old-fashioned layout of most of our home glasshouses, a higher labour force was necessary than should be the case. On the consumption of cucumbers, he said that this was remarkably low, atÃ½1 per head per annum. But in the mining areas, this consumption was doubled.",

The rise of 825 tons to 15.550 tons in copper was a little more than had been expected but the increase of 638 tons to 4,653 tons in lead caused no surprise.

The Zambia Sugar Company, part of the Tate and Lyle group; has taken the first step of raising Â£2m. in equity capital for a sugar estate heiny developed 100 miles south of Lusaka on the banks of the Kafue River. It is hoped that the balance would be raised within the next few months. This is another example of State participation in private enterprise, LUSAKA, Sept. 19. with the Zambian Government having provided Â£250,000 of the capital. The project to grow sugar at Nkambala Estate, where a factory is to be built for processing raw sugar, is in addition to the Â£250,000 sugar refinery 200 miles north of Lusaka at Ndola. The first sugar is expected to be produced at the Nkambala Estate in Octobr and it is expected that by the middle of 1968 production will go up to 30,000. tons a year, which should be sufficient to meet all Zambia's consumption needs.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staf THE MOST IMPORTANT thing I to be said about the recent meet- ing of the International Coffee Council is that its decisions mark I 4 new step forward in the history of commodity agreements in I general. The list of failures among g pacts of this sort-aimed at bring- I ing stability to international food and raw material markets-is d* I pressingly long. Schemes have I n tried for rubber, sugar, tea 1 and wheat but have, sooner or later, collapsed. This was either because they never included all the interested parties (the pre-war rubber agreement was torpedoed by the rapid increase in exports from a non-member. Indonesia) or because the fundamental problem, usually overproduction, was never tackled. The International Coffee Council still has much work to do if the Agreement is not to go under for similar reasons.. Indeed, until the recent meeting it could be said to be conducting no more than a holding operation. For through- out its existence the main problem has remained. Production in excess of consumption has been a con- stant factor, and world stocks have built up to an amount which, if unleashed upon the market, would cut coffee export earnings by S1.000m. a year from current levels. But now the International Coffee Council, the Agreement's governing body, has begun to grapple with the problems beyond depressed prices and in doing so has started along a road previously untravelled by any other com- modity agreement. Export Waivers Most important is the measure to cut back world production. Export waivers, the additional ex- port allowances given to members with particularly difficult over- production and stock problems, will not be granted for the third and fourth quarters of the coffee year unless one of two conditions are met. Either the countries con- cerned set aside 20 per cent. of the foreign exchange earnings to be reaped from these exports and uses it for diversification out of coffee; or, alternatively, they must set aside an amount of coffee from their stocks equivalent to the third and fourth quarter waivers. The determination of the Council in.this matter is shown by the fact that \" set asides\" will be held jointly by the Executive Director of the Coffee Organisa- tion and the country concerned, and failure to meet either require- ment, or a combination of both, before the third quarter begins. means automatic cancellation of outstanding waivers. Most countries have to be bullied in this way because, after all, coffee is one of the few commodities to- day which gives them a guaranteed return, Indeed, there are reports hat some countries are so pleased with their earnings that they are lanting more coffee trees. But hones that consumption will eventu- ally catch up with production are completely unrealistic. It has beep estimated that unless corrective measures are applied, world coffee production in 1971-72 may total 83m. bags against estimated require- mets of 76.4m. bags. At the satme time world stocks could total around 150m. bags. In this context. therefore, the conditioning of waivers to diversification is the council's most important decision. Of more immediate interest, how' ever, is the introduction of the selective adjustment of quotas according to demand. Coffee is not a homogeneous product but varies according to plant variety and quality. Even under the Agree- ment the price differential between high-priced Colombian Mild Arabicas and low'priced African Robustas can be as wide as Â£140 a ton. But the difficulties surrounding the introduction of a system to cope with this have been enormous. To begin with, any measure which might lead to a cut in an individual country's basic quota at the ex. pense of others is illegal under the constitution of the Agreement, something which has been a very strong weapon in the hands of those producers who have feared a fall-off in demand for their variety of coffee. Nevertheless, \"selectivity\" as it is known, has been introduced with ingenuity. First, there has been no increase in basic quotas for next season. They will total 43.7m. bags in 1965-66. Secondly, export- ing members have been given addi- tional quotas or special export authorisations totalling some l.lm. bags which are to be distributed pro rata to basic quotas and which will be subject to selective adjust- ment. With the market divided into four - Colombian, Mild Arabicas, Other Milds, Unwashed Arabicas (Brazils) and Robustas- each with its own price range, and provided prices stay within their respective ranges, export authorisa- tions will remain at their present levels. However, a price above or below the range of 15 consecutive days will trigger an increase or decrease in the overall authorised exports of the variety cQnccrned of 234 per cent. This is a mov which can be repeated downward to basic quota levels and upwards in- definitely, should demand for the variety of coffee be such that the price still refuses to move back within the agreed price range. The beauty of this new system is that it solves two controversies at the same time. First, the claim of the Robusta producers that their existing quotas are not suffcient to meet the increase in demand for their coffee because it is more suit- .able for the \"instant\" market. Secondly, the complaints of major importers, notably the U.S., that the Agreement is not always pro- * viding them with the coffee they need. In future any appreciable change in the pattern of consump- tion will. through the price mechanism, lead to an alteration in the variety of coffee being sent onto the market. In return the importing countries have agreed to limit their imports from non-member producer to pre- agreement levels. Other decisions taken by .the Council come under the general headings of tidying-up and adminis- trative improvements. Countries -which shipped above their quotas have been given a fresh start and plans are afoot for the Coffee Organisation to issue adhesive stamps equivalent to authorised exports for attaching to certificates of origin. There are difficulties here over small parcels separated from certificate during transit. But successfully introduced, the stamps will go a long way towards prevent- ing \" tourist\" coffee and the ship- ping of coffee in excess of quota by \"mistake.\" In fact the Coffee Agreement already looks a healthier and more useful object than it did before the Council meeting began, The history of the last 50 years shows that a commodity agreement must eventu- ally come to terms with market forces if it is to survive. The Coffee Agreement is now moving in the right direction. The credit for this must go mainly to Dr. J. 0. Santos. the organisation's Executive Direc- tor. Because of his world-wide tour after the near disaster of the December Council meeting, dele gates arrived in London fully aware of all the problems, Arot just their owLs . - .-",

ADMINISTRATION supporters are confident that they will succeed to-morrow in reviving the \"Trutli in Packaging\" Bill which is ir danger of Congressional defeat This measure-which has receive& warm support from Presideni Johnson in the past two years-is one of the few pices of legislatior on the Administration's \"must\" list for the remaining weeks of this session of Congress. The Bill has already been approved by the Senate. and th- House Commerce Committe- recently completed hearings. How. ever, at an executive session last week a surprise vote to kill th- measure for this year was successful by 12 to 7. Representative Harley Staggers, the committee chairman, at once promised to bring the Smatter up for another vote, and this will probably happen to-morrow. It would seem that most of the 14 absent committee members (there are 3 members) intnd to vote to continue with the Billt Nevertheless, it is most probable that even if the Bill emerges from the committee, the legislation will only be a very watered-down version of that passed by the I Senate. Bitterly opposed by the Spackaging and processing industries. the measure is primarily designed to save the housewife both time and money, and has been given strong support by women's and organised labour organisations. The Bill is in two parts. One orders the Food and Drug Adminis- tration to enforce regulations that insist that the weight or count of package contents be very clearly displayed on all packaging; the second part lays down exact rules for individual products.

THE MILLION-STRONG united steel workers' union has attacked President Johnson's wage restraint guidelines as likely to delay the goal of full employment and. production. A union report issued yesterday, on the eve of its 13th constitutional convention, said the Government's 3.2 per cent. limit on annual wage increases was inequitable and un- workable. The report said: \"There is not even any pretence of guideposts for the resulting profits and dividends.\" The union's president, Mr. I. W.

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff WASHINGTON. Sept. 19. AFTER a fortnight's desultory debate the 1966 Civil Rights Bill died to-day when the Senate refused for the second time in less ,than a week to vote to end a '\"filibuster\" on the measure. This is the first occasion since this 1957 law was passed that Civil Rights legislation has foundered in Congress. To-day's vote was expected and-despite strenuous efforts of many Liberals-virtually a formality. On' both occasions supprters of this legislation won a majorits today by n5 to 41) but -vot o \"*cl tur i\" (thereb ending a filibuster) neds a tweo- thirds majority of those voting. Ten Rebublicans voted for cloture- 20 Republicans-and 21 Demo crats-voted against. The legislation's cause had been hopeless since it became clear last week that the, Senate minority leader, Senator Everett. Dirkseni was not going to waver in his implacable opposition to the measure. Mr. Dirksen baulked at the \"fair housing\" provisions of the Bill, which would partially ban discrimina. tion in the sale and renting of hbuses. Whereas most previous rights' laws applidlargely to the South (tan much of this year's Bill would hiav I--- applied only in the South) the \" fair housing\" section might have broken up de facto segregation in Northern cities, and this was too much for Dirksen. In past years his support was essential to the success of civil rights legislation: this year his opposition brought about its failure. Senator Mike Mansfield, Senate majority leader, insisted this after- noon: \"Whatever blame there is attaches to us all.\" He added that \"if prospects for the passage are to be mproved questions of rioting, marches, shootn and ilammatory statements whih have caracterised this simmering summer of 1966 in rban areas of the n wl have to be faced frankly and bluntly.\"",

   "article_dc_title" : "The Longest, Richest Season so Far",
   "text_content" : "BY Our US. sI WHEN tbhe Washington Redskins lost theair opening me of the not worried. he commented Swe've sold all our season tickets His remark enraged 46.000 Washingtonians who had each laid out $38.50 for their season tickets; but he accurately summed up the state of American football. For the U.S. ha just begun what will undoubtedly be its longest and richst football season. During tbc next three montha, the TV et- works will pay $44m. for the right to televise rofessional and college games, while advertisers will spend over $100m. in sponsoring these programmes. With America engrossed in a seemingly insatiable craze for foot- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ball, in theory the owners of pro- sessional clubs should have to do ,lile but sit back and nt their money. That a football club is a profitable holding was borne out b lat month's.ale of the San Diego Chargers t a group of iCal- foran businesmen for S1nm. Although far from all clubs play to capacity crowds, most can rec- kon on seat sales of between S1.2m. and S2m. over the season. From TV rights, members of the National Footbal League receive S1.2m. and clubs in the American Football Leae $900,000. Local radio rights and concessions at the stadium itself-whether car park. ing fees or hot dog sales-bring most clubs at least an extra 5250,000. But club owners have plenty to worry about as the 1966 season opens, for events in the past six months have thoroughly upset the structure of the game. Following an extraordinary \" biddia war for outstand from cear whether football will be granted exemption fr t stiff provisions of anti-trust legislation, For many years, American foot. ball has been dominated by the National Football League which had the best ctic&-New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia. etc.-and the best players. Since 1960, the NFL has been challenged by the American Football League, although it had fewer teams, few stars and very little money. The AFL was given a firm financial footing-some say it was rescued- two years ago when the National Broadcasting Company, moving in on the rising oplarty of pro sessional football, gave the League a fve-year contract for 36m. This meant that at last the AL could Compete for players-which it did with a vengeance, for the New York Jets promptly paid Joe Namath. of the Univesit of Alabama, $400.000 for his s elrces. College Stars Although unfit for military service, Namath proved a great success on the professional football field, and his value as a spectator attraction for the Jets was not lost on other clubs. Last winter most clubs engaged in what has been termed \" the costliest war in sports history\" as enormous bonuses were offered to college stars. Several stars gained 5100,000 bonuses, a choice few $250.000, while the NFL champions, the Green Bay Packers, paid out $600.000 for Donny Anderson of Texas Tech. Obviously, established players objected to untried players receiv. ing bonuses of 15 times their annual -salaries, and before this season began the clubs faced demands from regular players for rises of between 60 and 70 per cent and for many-year contracts. In some cases these demands were met, for with football enjoying such a boom the clubs did not begrudge the extra expense. But they seem to have panicked in May when the New York Giants, of the NFL. \"poached\" a star plaver, Pete Gogolak. from the AFL Buffalo Bills. This opened up the prospect of an even fiercer bidding war, and although discussions had been in progress for some months, within days of Gogolak joining the NFL the leagues announced their merger. Because of their TV commit- ments, the leagues cannot merge fully until 1970, but from now on there is to be a \"world champion- ship game \" (only the U.S. portrays the best team in a game it alone plays as the world champion), a common draft to stop the bonus bidding, and an end to any poach. ing of players. The new league will have 24 teams in 22 fitlU, will dominate the major popula- tion areas of the U.S., will eert a stranglehold on its players, and will blatantly contradict U.S. ant- trust legislation. The last aspect of the merger is causing great worry to the clubs and they have made quite clear what they want. They are asking Congress to give the game special exemption from anti-trust laws \"because of the peculiar nature of the game.\" They hope that Con- gress will support a Bill submitted by Senator Philip Hart which would give football exemption. This measure has already been approved by the Senate. but at the moment it appears ensnared in the House, for Representative Emanuel Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which would handle the legislation, is opposed to football getting any exemption. The NFL commissioner, Mr. Peter Rozelle, has warned that the whole merger might have to be \" revaluated \" if Congress did noth- ing before it disperses. $910,000 Contract A failure by Congress to act this session would not. as Mr. Rozelle claims, mean the breakdown of the proposed merger. But it would mean that clubs would not be able to avoid the expensive task of bidding for talent-nor would they be guaranteed control of their players for as long as they wanted. One indication of what this would mean was provided recently: for John Brodie of the NFL San Francisco team. was offered $750,000' to join the Houston Oilers of the AFL. The announce- ment of the merger put a stop to the deal-only Mr. Brodie did not co-operate. Either he received his money or he would bring an anti- trust action which would wreck the merger, Brodie told the clubs. Between them. Houston and San Francisco took the easy way out, and Brodie has a four-year contract guaranteeing him 5910,000.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent . .. OTTAWA, Sept. 19. Canada's two major .railways can expect to realise approximately $33m. in additional income over a full year from the 10 per cent. freight rate in- crease they will impose from October 10. The two railways have declined to give estimates of the additional revenue they expect. However, last year the Canadian National Railways freight revenues amounted to S654.325000 and those of Canadian Pacific Railway $461,192.000o The railways have indicated that the in. cre ill affect about 30 per cent. of t!rreight v revenue. On that basis the CNR would realise an estimated I $19.6m. from the increase and the CPR S13.8m. But neither line has any idea how much freight traffic they will lose to the road, water and air services after the higher rates are imposed. One spokesman said here to-day a figure of about $30m. in additional revenue might be a \"good *guess.\" Meanwhile, the Government an- nounced over the week-end that. under its decision to guarantee a prairie rail network, a total of 17,293 miles of railway lines-including main and branch lines-is to be maintained until January 1, 1975. across the prairie provinces. ii i i ii i i I I i",

   "text_content" : "The following Statement by Mr. W. V. Sonedey, Chealian Is to be submitted as read to the AnnuaalGerI Meeting to bI held on 13th October, 1966: I am pleased to report that the group profit before' taxation amounted to Â£639,267 compared with Â£557,395 In the previous year. Taxation takes Â£260,398 of this profit aginst Â£229,103 last year. An interim dividend of 5% was paid to the ordinary share. holders on 30th March last and your directors are now recom- mending the payment of a final dividend of 7%% on the ordinary shares which will make a total of 12%% for the year, i. equal to the previous year's rate. It will be observed that the retentions for the year amount to Â£97.518 compared with Â£144,326 last year. This reduction in spite of our higher earnings is substantially the result of the change in the taxation system whereby in addition to the corporation tax charged on profits, the income tax deducted from dividends has to be handed over to the Revenue at time of payment. In the year under review the amount involved in .this respect is approximately Â£97,500. We secured 12% increased turnover during the year under review, to which increase both the canned and frozen food sides of our business contributed. The rate of growth in our frozen food operations continued as I forecast this time last year, and in fact for the first time since we commenced the production of frozen foods rather more than half of the trading profits earned in the year were attributable to this side of our business. Exports Increased Despite quotas, licences, import duties and other restrictions, in force in some parts of the world to which we export, our export sales, although small in relation to our total turnover, showed nearly 20% increase, which in all the circumstances can be called progress. The constant policy of increased mechanisation and the adoption of new techniques which we have followed for many years is evidenced by the pattern of capital expenditure on produc- tion and distribution facilities. During the year under review we spent Â£413,000 on capital account and at the year end had com- mitments of a further Â£173,000. The increased profit achieved this year is in no small measure attributable to the team spirit which exists amongst our staff at all levels. I am sure you would wish me to express appreciation of their continued keenness. The relationship with our growers continues to be good. This is soundly based upon a mutual understanding of the other's point of view, but at the same time realisation that both the growers and the company share the same task of disposing of the produce of our labours on a continuing basis. Our packaging and label designs have again been subjected to critical appraisal and as a result a wide range of new and improved designs giving more effective presentation are currently being introduced. Extensive Range of Products Reference to the back cover of our annual report this year clearly shows the very extensive range of products, both canned and quick frozen which we produce and market; Time saving \" convenience foods \" coupled with variety is what the modern housewife demands and can pay for today. It is my constant endeavour to give her what she wants at a fair price, coupled with good dependable quality. . We are continually striving for the fullest utilisation of our facilities throughout the year and have gone some way towards achieving this ideal. A further number of new products is under active consideration some of which will, I hope, in due course carrry us still further in this direction. It may have been thought by some that increased consumption of quick frozen food would react to the detriment of canned foods. This is certainly not the case as far as our experience goes, in fact the sales of several of our most important traditional lines of canned vegetables show a most encouraging trend and I have every reason for thinking that this will continue. Healthy Start to Current Year So far as the current year is concerned, we commenced on the lit June last with stocks at the lowest el so ten year Which I would call a healthy start, Ft , forwrd entered into for many of our major Ih e pprBab ig than at this time last year.

In a more predictable political climate I would say without hedging that the outlook for the current financial year is most encouraging and that better profits flowing from greater pio- ductivlty and sales could be expected with confidence, but in the present state of uncertainty, having as its basi the unpredictability of dovernmental action, such an unqualified predletion would certainly be unwise. eleetive Employment Tax Take the selective employmenti ta, whilst as manufacturers t might be thought that we should gan some advantage there. from.

Political contact arro the cciour in in South Africa will be outlawed nder the terms of a Government Bill intro duced in Parliament to-day. While its immediate aim is to deal with the future Parlia- mentary representation of the 1lm. coloureds (mixed blood), its effect will be to hedge politics into strict racial categories. It will, among other thinpg, mean that multl-raial parties like the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party and forums of political dis- cussion such as the august South African Institute of Race Relations and the 17,000-strong National Union of South African Students will have to reform their member- ship to a whites-only basis to survive-albeit in emasculated form.

   "text_content" : "From Our Ow Correspondent STOCKHOLM, Sept. 19. The Social Democratic Party suffered a crubhing defeat i te muncipal elections held here yesterday. Erxcadlg postal votes their los was 8.2 per cent The Prime Minister, Mr. Tage Erlander, said in a television interview early this morning: \"We in the Party leadership consider the election result very serious. There is no doubt that it is a landslide loss and we cannot rule out the possibility of a new general election. The Social Democratic Party polled 42.8 per cent. of the votes compared with 51 per cent. at the last municipal elections in 1962. Gains were made by the Com- munists of 2.7 per cent., bringing their total up to 6.6 per cent. of the votes cast At the same time the Consera- tive with 14.7 per cent. and the centre Party with 14 per cent. made margisnl gains, while the Liberals dropped rom 17 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The poll was to elect 30.000 municipal councillors and 1,753 county councillors. The result has a siTnilcant effect as the county councillors Will elect one-half of the Fifst Chamber of the Riksdag during the next four years, For the first time the Liberals, .onservatives and Centre Party have loined forces against the Social Demo. crats in a number of areas and this is seen as a very great threat to the Government. It appears that the gain by the Communists was at the expense of the Government party. A new party, the Christian Democrats, polled 1.8 per cent. In terms of seats in the county council elections the Social Democrats lost 94, including their majority in three major' cities, bringing them down to 804 seats, the Centre Party with 267 seats shows a gain of 40 and the Conservatives with a loss of 12 now have 238. The Liberal dropped four to 281, while the Com- munists with 81 seats show a gain of 52 and two coalition groups won 81 seats between them. It is further expected that the postal votes wil probably underline still further the trend against the Government Party. The municipal elections are generally considered to give a very good guide to general elections, and circles close to the Government were predicting last week that a shift of voters amounting to at the most 2 per cent. would be considered very serious. If the actual shift of just over 8 per cent. was continued at the next general election in 1968 it would result in a total defeat for the Govern. ment in the Second Chamber of the Rikiaag. Seventyeight per cent. of t.he voters polled in yesterday's elections. See Men and Matters Page 10",

It Is one of a batch, made l Lelpig, East Germany, by Santea and delivered to the Soviet Union for hdiBg and stori timber carried to tbh plant by river boats. It weighs 135 Ibs, s more than 131 feet above ground and its lspports are 492 feet apart, enabling the operator to se over the whole storage area. HERR K. U. VON HASSEL, the West German Defence Minister, to-day asked the U.S. to give its European allies the iight to veto any reduction of American mili- tary strength in Europe. Herr von Hassel, who will accompany Dr. Erhard to Washington at the end of this week, was speaking to a meeting in Munich of the Atlantic Treaty Association. Full Examination He did not exclude the possibility f reducing U.S. strength in Europe. after caretul examination of the issues, but added: \"It would be disastrous to mutual confidence and cohesion within the Alliance if the U.S. were to ponder and decide issues by itself. We ar of the opinion that Washington sbould make no plans or decisions against A European vote.\" The possibility of the U.S reducing its Seventh Army which is stationed in Europe, is gcnerally linked with improved air traport facilities. Herr von Hassel said that the C.SA air transport coming into service in 1970 would permit the Americans to move entire units with armour across great distances. That would increase the deterrent effect of U.S. military strength. But he made clear that the ability to fy troops across the Atlantic was no full substitute for stationing them in Europe. There :might only be a few hours advance warning of any attack from the East. It is unlikely that HTer von Hassel's arguments will receive much of a welcme from Mr MeNamara n s Ngton. or are the; Â·~iÂ·-Â·~LIÂ·-7Â·~ -Â·1 UÂ·~i ~~~~~ \"1 :4Â·-i- Â·Â·__rl._.._. Americans expected to applaud his repetition of German demands for a share in nuclear strategy. A third point upon which agree- ment will be difficult to find when Dr. Erhard visits Washington is that of offsetting the foreign exchange which the U.S. spends on Seventh Army. The Germans are alread behind hand with their buying on U.S. arms, and Herr von Hassel hinted that things would get worse. It was certain he said, that a full offset would meet with very great diffi- culties in future. In the meantime, he said, he was examining whether the Bundeswehr should fly entire brigades to the U.S. for exercises. It is true that better training facilities are available there. and that the purchase of the neces. sary aircraft would help the U.S. with its balance of payments. But there is something odd about flying German soldiers to the U.S. in order to make it easier for the US. to keep its own men in Germany. The outlook is therefore hardly bright for Dr. Erhard's trip to the U.S. He is unlikely to return from it with increased strength to tackle hiW domestic troubles. None the less. the Chancellor has decided to postpone until after his return on September 28, a decision on the succession to Dr. Ludger Westrick. the Minister who ran the Chancellery for him. Though he accepted the resignation today, Dr. Erhard asked his associ* ate to carry on for the time being.",

   "text_content" : "By OwÃ½Zwib Corespnden FOR THE PAST 30 years now Switzerland has been one of the bet-known and most important hosts to foreign holding com- panics. A trend which began pri- marily for political reasons well before the war gainedtremendous impetus in the j950s, when the highly-expansive Western eco. nomies became fully alive to the advantages offered by a centrally- positioned European country with a hard, freely-convertible currency and-most important-low tax rates,. The special conditions ofered by a number of Cantonal authorities to foreign-owned holding con- panics domiciled within their bailiwicks made the establishment of a Swiss letter-box company a more attractive prospect still. To-day, there are thousands of such companies in the Confedera- tion-particularly, of course, in \"cut-price \" Cantons like Zoug and Fribourg-benefiting not only from the minimal taxes but also from the double-taxation agreements be- tween Switzerland and the home country of the holding company's owners. German View The question as to how long Switzerland can remain a full scale tax haven has been put in the limelight by the negotiations current between the Federal Ger- man Government and the Swiss Ministry of Finance and Excise on the revision of the German-Swiss Double Taxation Agreement. Bonn claims that there are now over 6,000 foreign holding and finance companies established in Switzerland, some 1,500 of them in West German hands. Over last year alone transfers were made from the Federal Republic to Switzerland of DM270m. (some Â£24.3m.) in respect of interest, DM220m. in dividends, DM215m. in licence fees and DM125m. in \"participation revenue.\" This compared with a flow of only DM47m. in toto in the other direc- tion. The West German Government, now having a hard job to put through its stabilisation pro- gramme, objects strongly to losing such a volume of taxes. German letter-box companies domiciled in Switzerland must r\"der the present agreement be regarded by the German fiscal authorities as purely Swis concerns, which that ty pe y on revenue from the ede Rpublic only 15 per cent. instead of 25 per cen. on dividends. for example, and nothing at all (instead of 25 per c nt.) Ott interest and licence fees. The German authorities are therefore now pressing for some sort of amendment to the Double Taxation Agreement whereby German-owned companies based in Switzerland without having a genuine operational function there will in future bexcluded from the advantes of the Agreement. Although it i patently very difficult to distlguish between \" bona fide\" companies and those existing merely to make use of fiscal advantages, Bonn hopes by the end of this year to have come to some settlement with Switzerland similar to that it reached recently with Luxembourg, another country which of late has been favoured by foreign holding companies. First Departure Germany also wants to be able to raise taxes on Swiss earnings and property of persons liable to German tax and is working for a number of other amendments in. eluding changes in the current treatment of taxpayers with double domicile (in Germany and Switzer- land) and in the mutual exchange of information on taxpayers. Although the German move is by far the most significant to date, it is by no means the first. In fact. a number of countries apart from the Federal Republic have in recent years been at least partially success- ful in talking Switzerland into a watering-down of its tax laws in respect of foreigners and foreign companies. The first notable de- parture from normal Swiss practice came as early as 1959 with a revi- sion of the Swiss-Pakistani Double Taxation Agreement, whereby Switzerland conceded to a 20 per cent. Pakistani tax on dividends of holding-type trading companies; this was, however, a special case meant by the Swiss authorities as a model for agreements with develop- ing countries. The next blow to the Swiss tax haven came from a unilateral move by the United States, with its ruling of 1962 enabling certain profits of foreign holding companies owned by U.S. interests to be reckoned on the tax bill of the parent copan As the first real bilteral agree between Switzerland and a oped country came the revision of the Swiss-Swedish Agreement May, 1965; this move, which w directed against the \" tax drain Switzerland, was then considered to have been an exception to th rule. But further departures from what was once rigidly observed Swiss practice were presented by the new Agreements with Spain and Holland of April and June, 1966U respectively, while amendments to the provisions governing the flow of licence fees from the United Kingdom to British-owned Swiss companies were added to the Swiss. British Double Taxation Agree. ment, also in June of this year. Still awaiting ratification is a new Swiss-French Agreement, which is reported to go so far as to allow France to claim from French- owned companies in Switzerland, whether \"real\" or \"unreal,' aÂ» certain amount of tax. All the assaults to which Swiss tax practice has been subjected over the past few years, particularly the threats reportedly made by the German and Dutch Governments some three or four years ago to cancel the Double Taxation Asree ments altogether, seem to have made a considerable impression on the Berne Tax Department. While Swiss spokesmen still adhere to the official opinion that the tax advantages present in the Con* federation are a perfectly valid reason for any foreign interest to establish a company there, the feel- ing appears to be growing fast in Government circles that Double Taxation Agreements should not be relegated to loopholes for foreign tax-dodgers. \"Oasis Report\" There is increasing understanding for the standpoint of foreign Governments wishing to alter the current agreement, especially since the presentation in 1964 of the German Government's .so-called \"Oasis Report\" on tax haven facilities and the damage they cause to the Federal German economy. And the Swiss are fair enough to admit that they them- selves have taken very thorouh measures to stop a flow of Swiss profits to neighbouring Liechten- stein.",

Addressing the Rio de Janeiro Chamber of Commerce, he de- clared that these criticisms came mostly from those who had not really examined the facts, Our exports last year totalled over Â£4,700m.; this is more than 16 per sent. of the country's gross national product. This year in spite of setbacks, including the sea- men's strike, exports have con- tinued to rise. \"For the first eight months of this year, exports exceeded by 5H per cent. those of the correspond- ing period last year and the total for August was an all time record of Â£440m.\" he stressed. Not happy However, Mr. Mason said that Britain's record of trade with Brazil had not been so happy. \"Our exports to this country fell in both 1964 and 1965, but there are signs of an improvement.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent * TOKYO, Sept. 19. Delegates attending the frst conference of Indonesia' creditor nations closed the Ast session today with an agree. ment to reschedule debt payments to permit Djakarta to rebuild the nation's crumbling economy. If the representatives of 11 countries with outstanding loans to Indonesia reach full agreement on all aspects of the situation- including the possibility of further loans-during the second and last session to-morrow, bilateral talks are expected to follow. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Office said the representa. tives are scheduled to-morrow to discuss the possibility of inviting those Communist countries with unpaid loans to Indonesia to the next meeting. Half of the $2,680m. outstanding from Indonesia is owed to the Soviet Union. Although \"some progress\" was reported on ways in which debts and interest payments might be rescheduled, the spokesman re- vealed, there were differences in the financial and legal systems of the nations represented which pre- vented general agreement on \" cer- tain subjects\" during the day. Secrecy on loans The spokesman agreed with observers who said there was no discussion of additional loans to Indonesia during to-day's session. It was not revealed what was dis- cussed at an hour-long meeting behind closed doors this afternoon, nor would the delegates comment on details of private, industrial or trade loans to Indonesia when the session closed to-day. Representative attending the \"T o Club ' meeting seemed unte in their desire to provide the Indonesian leaders with an oppor- tunity to save the economy. It was expected that during Tuesday's con- ference the delegates would hear a report from Sultan Hamengku Buwono or his assistants on Indonesia's plans to revive the economy. An International Monetary Fund mission, under the leadership of Tun Thin, director of the Asian Bureau of the IMF, this morning read a report on their findings following a recent survey of the Indonesian economy.

Bank of Canton building in Hong Kong. The girders, 48 feet long and 37 tons in weight, were supplied by Dornan Long (Building and Engineering) and are believed to be the biggest of their type in the Far East. INDIAN businessmen and policy- makers fear a serious disruption of development because of the re- ported decline in export earnings and the growing accumulation of unsold stocks in many industries. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India is understood, to have written a letter to the Finance Minister, warning about the deep- ening crisis and calling for a re- view of the fourth plan commit- ments. Unpublished figures suggest that the rise in exports noticed in the first five months of this year has been reversed since devaluation. Exports in June have been roughly 10 per cent. lower than in the correspondin month last year and the performance in July has also been equally dis- appointing. aven aIter taking into account the Rupee revaluation, exports are said to be currently running at about Rs.680m. (Â£34m.) per month as against the pak level of Rs.650m. Rs;770m. (Â£35m..Â£43m.) earlier this year at predevaluation rates. Though the set back in exports is perhaps exaggerated (for example, it ignores the temporary suspension in the rupee trade during June and July) the Reer a Bank fars that the inabilty to push up exports fter devalueaton NEW DELHI, Sept. 19. pinpoints the threat of a perpetual balance of payments crisis. In its annual report released to-day the Reserve Bank has clearly stated tht \"it is of the utmost importance that a determined attack on the root cause of inflation is made. Otherwise considerable distortions in the economy are likely to occur.\" The report has presented a gloomy picture of conditions and prospects and rather bodly asks the Govern. ment to do some \" careful rethinking of the strategy of future develop. ment.\" The Reserve bank wants to emphasise the achievement of a fair balance between actual outlays and savings and supply of wage goods in order to contain inflation and the pressure on prices. Ironically however, a number of new industries in the Bombay region are complaining that they are hit by the recent indiscriminate licensing of imports for capital and intermediate goods, while consumer goods in- dustries are complaining of higher costs, falling demand and some are even thinking of layoffs. It is this situation that seems to have prompted powerful industrial delegations to come out openly with demand- for ad hoc tax concessions price decontrol and additional cash assistance for exports at he meeting ao the Export-mport Advisory Cosuncil here yesterday.",

And he was recalling that the present e facto President, Lt.-Gen. Juan Carlos Onganla, proclaimed himself a staunch defender of the con. stltution--a legalist \"-in 1962, but that now that he has apprco priated the presidential sash, h is an \"ant-legalist.\" \"No one,\" said Dr. Illia, \"can foresee what will happen next\" \"Taking Hold\" Again It was his first Press interview since he was deposed and, also since two personal tragedies in his life-the death of an elder brother last month and the death of his wife Silvia Elvira early this month. At the time of the coup d'dtat, Sra. llia was at the Anderson Hospital in Houston. where terminal cancer of the spine was diagnosed. With three unhappy events in less than three months behind him, the 66- year-old Arturo Illia apparently was \"taking hold\" again. If so, the setting-the cheaply built new Buenos Aires suburban home (Roman brick in front and back) of a younger brother-was un- t ePo as a \"headquarters of the opposition.\" But unmistakably a ferment whch wa U not in B, ct with hagi unfashonable, r oft th jus th f Buenos Alms, had seized the modest homne of Rficar l1ia, Across the narrow threshold of the front door, there was a coln and going of personan who urtn 3 months of the lI rdetimi used Government House in much the same way: Presidential Press Secretary Luis ,Caero, ex-National Development Council Chief Roque Carranza, ex. Interior Minister Juan Palmero, ex. Military Houshold Chief Brig. Gen. Manuel C Soia. Peronits' Power Denied Only the reportedly.impoverished x-president with his wrinkled face, tieles shirt and deep, rough voice, seemed to fit into the setting which has been his home since he was driven there straight from Govern- ment House between 7 and 8 a.mn on June 28. On the wall behind him, there were two framed 1965 documents, one attestin that Ricardo Illia, \" Presidential Tech nical Secretary.\" had been made a commander in the French Legion of Honour and the other attesting that his entire family enjoyed the benediction of Pope Paul VI. \"They say that the Argentine political parties, and especially our party, are old and outdated, that they cannot cope with the present- day needs of the country. But it is precisely because our party is old-the oldest political party in Latin America-that it is of vaue.\" Dr. Illia continued his defence of the 83-year-old middle-of-the-road People's Radical Party, founded as a counterforce to the landed aristo- cracy. \"Who would say that the Republican and Democratic Parties in the U.S.. which are 150 years old, are outmoded or that the Roman Catholic Church, which Is 2,000 years old, cannot update Dr. Arturo lllia as we have. We dempnstrated that we could live together with the Peronists without having body- guards around.\" The former President no more than alluded to the estimate- apparently widely accepted-of himself and of his government as ineffective, inept, do-nothing. \"These gentlemen have found out that it is easier to say things than it is to do them.\" The business community, for example, has begun criticising the new authorities for having failed during nearly 90 days in power to make any organic changes in the much-belaboured Illia economic policy. A month ago, Economy Minister Jorge 'Nestor Sallrmel devalued the ptW' lightly (s5.5 pr cnt.) in the *anner as is People's Radical predecessor had done in the pas When informed that foreign oil men have swarmed into uos ires again in the hope of signing contracts with the new Government thus reversing the policy of Dr. tl, who annulled 13 developmenttt and drilling contracts as the first important measure of his admi itration-the deposed presiden : \"'If they sign up, they will have the same trouble again when a constitutional Government comes ack into power.\" In Dr. Illia' ~pinion, 80 per cent. of the oicers in the Armed Forces opposed the coup d'tat. Political Parties Dissolved \"These gentlemen talk about staying in power dictatorially for 10 years or more. Hitler gave the ThIrd Reich a thousand years. That which begins badly, ends badly, and soon.\" But he did not say how it could end soon. Elec- ions now would be meaninaless, he said, because now it has been proved one time too many that certain officers of the Argentine Armed Forces are not willing to abide by the rules of the democracy game. The People's Radical Party would continue to fight, Dr. Illia insisted, although all the 50 candidate producing Agentine political parties officially have been dissolved and have bad their assets confiscated. As it happened ex-President Illia found his politi- cal voice again on the same day that the Interior Ministry leaked to the Press details of the forth. coming implementation of the decree-law dissolving the parties. According to the leak, \"it is calcu- lated that the measure will impede in some way the appearance of documents and publications, speeches or interviews by leaders of the former political parties.\" it remains to be seen whether President Illia will be silenced.",

In Britain, they are aimed at the 5,000 companies employing less than 26 workers, and both provide the high graphic quality of hot metal work at less than Â£2,000 for the 72 composer and about Â£9,000 for its magnetic tape version. The design is basically that of the well-known \"golf-ball typewriter system. Butthe company has so far develped 50 type fonts in moderm and classical styles now used, ranging in size from seven to 12 point. Justification of copy is automatic on the magnetic tape machine and semi-automatic on the smaller ver- sion. Copy is produced in two columns, the first allowing for all the adjustmants, changes of type face and justflcations. Correction is automatic as a built-in memory stores the last it -I-- I six to nine letters typed. Corrections are made by back-spacing and typing over the mistake. For the smaller machine, operators knowing the keyboard of the 72 typewriter can be trained in a few hours to reach speeds .up to 14 characters per second. The larger unit, it is claimed, is more than twice as fast as hot metal equipment. Both machines turn out printed copy ready for photography, using a speci- ally developed once-through ribbon to give the highest possible quality. The company has been developing these units for seven years, and made yesterday's announcement on a world- wide basis. The smaller machine is expected to be available on a six. month delivery while the larger one is likely to take between 14 and 18 months.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent \"BOTH THE board of manage- ment of the Bank of Finland and the Parliamentary Banking Con- mittee are committed to maintain- ing the statutory value of the Fionmark. Since there is no com- pelling reason for a devaluation, these regulations must be scrupulously observed.\" This statement by Mr. Klaus Waris, Governor of the Bank of Finland, was released in direct response to the Press headlines and radio and television reports in Finland that followed publication in THE FINANCIAL TIMEs on September 14 of an article by Lombard entitled \"Why do small countries resist devaluation so? \" In part, the debate in the news media and in banking and business circles was unfortunately based on summary translations of the original article, as has happened so often before. But in part the proponents of devaluation felt they had found heavy' ammunition for their case, and the opponents, led by the Governor, were naturally irritated. \"The Governor only denies rumours of devaluation once every six months\" said a bank spokesman recently. Lomabrd's article led him to break this rule. Mr. Waris's statement continued: \"The writer in TA FINANCIAL Timas admits that the Finnish authorities' measures to restore equilibrium in the balance of payments have begun to show results. The authorities under. stand well enough, without being instructed that the achievement o this woa will involve a weaker growtf thnational income until HELSINKI, Sept 19. a sound basis has been established for a new upswing.\" The real point made in Finland is that however fine Lombard's argu- ments may sound in theory, they are not applicable in practice to Finland. To quote Mr. Waris again, \"A de- valuation of the Finnmark would only promote inflation without by that route providing any noteworthy new stimulus for an increase of exports. since the country's forest resources already set a limit to expansion of the paper and pulp industry.\" Editorial comment so far agrees with Mr. Waris. Helsingin Sanomat, independent daily, the biggest news- paper in Finland, wrote of Lombard's \"rather odd claim that devaluation is a painless measure for a small coun. try. Devaluation can only be a com. pulsory solution if there is no other way out. In spite of all the seripus mistakes and imbalance of payments, we are not yet in such dire straits.\""

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORDON TETHER I wonder if it is too much to hope that, now that a \" broader margin of safety in the underptnnin of major world currencies has created through the elaboration of the swap credits system, the ad- vanced countries of the world will turn their attention to another aspect of the international financial scene that is giving rise to considerable concern - the deep inroads the under - developed countries are having to make into the inflow of new aid to deal with the growth of the debt service burden arising from earlier assis- tance. Sad Fact \"The very sad fact is,\" said Mr. Kibaki, Kenya's Commerce Minister, when commenting over the week-end on Commonwealth Conference discussions on the development aid issue. \" that most of the under-developed countries are now paying back to the developed countries amounts equal to half the aid they are receiving. He was not exaggerating. The overall flow of aid from the \"have\" to the \"have not\" countries of the world stopped rising early in the 1960s. Since then some of the principal donors have been bogged down in balance of payments troubles which they claimed made it quite impossible for them to accept any additional commitments in this field. Most of the rest have run into economic difficulties at home - difficulties which they considered made it equally impossible for them to add to existing budgetary stresses by stepping up Governmental contri- butions to foreign aid programmes. Grace Periods But whereas the total flow of aid into the under-developed countries has remained within close distance of the $10,00m. mark taking offi- cial and private activity together, the return flow of money from these countries to the donors in respect of interest and repayments on previous assistance has been rising fast. This is partly, of course, because the total debt to be ser- viced is rising all the time. But a more important reason is to be found in the fact that the grace periods that are a normal feature of repayment arrangements are coming to an end in respect of many of the earlier loans. Amorti- sation is accordingly becoming much more of a problem. In consequence, it would seem that service payments in respect of Government. and Government- guaranteed borrowing alone are now absorbing as much as a~third respect of interc~st and repayments on previous assistance has been rising fast. This is partly, of course, because- the total debt to be ser- viced is'rising all the time. But a more important reason Â·is to be Â· taund in the tact that the grace periods that are a normal feature of repayment arrangements are coming to an end in respect of many of the earlier loans. Amorti- sation is accordingly becoming much more of a problem. In consequence, it would seenr that service. payments in rcspect of Government and Ooucmuncat- guaranteed borrowing alone am now ab~Lg as much ras:athitd of the inflow of new aid, compared with less than a quarter only a couple of years or so back. It would not be surprising to find that service payments in respect of aid received through private channels are large enough to bring the total set-off against new aid up to the 0S per cent. mark, if not beyond It Moreover, it is the case that, besides halting the growth of the aid flow to the less-developed countries, ' the increasing pre- occupation of the donor tountries with their own economic difficulties has tended to reverse the earlier trend towards the introduction of easier terms on new lending. This hardening of hearts towards the less-developed areas his found expression not only in a greater unwillingness to make loans avail- able at concessionary rates of interest-even the U.S. recently took action to Increase charges for official loans to the backward countries - it has also been reflected in a shortening of repay- ment periods. So the situation can be said to be deteriorating in a two-fold sense. New Arrangements It is true that advanced countries in general have been displaying a considerable willingness to collaborate in arranging the re- scheduling of debt repayment obligations where the pressures imposed on the payments positions of under-developed countries by such commitments have threatened to prove intolerable-ald this is increasingly - the- case. Many bilateral deals aimed at spreading out capital repayments over a much longer period than was originally contemplated and trimr- ming back interest charges have been concluded .duriS the pst year or tWo.- And ii particularly bad cases the advanced countries concerned have worked in concert to devise a general solution to the problem. A Great Help This is, of course, a great help. But it certainly does not mean that the problem is being effectively con- tained. If under-developed coun- tries are made to wait for relief- as at present they tend to be-until their external payments positions are almost at breaking point, their economic life is inevitably subjected to serious distortion before help arrives. Moreover, the undermining of the confidence of foreign inves. tors in their future which such a setback is apt to bring about is not necessarily going to be reversed, I need hardly say, when they are duly bailed out by their creditors. What is more probable is that they will tend to be regarded from this point onwards as being mortgaged up to the hilt and consequeny not a fitting outlet for additional development finance. There is the further highly important point that, unless undex developed countries know in advance that they are going to be able to count upon getting appro- priate relief from debt service obligations, the difficulties they encounter in planning their econoW mic advancement are rendered, much more acute. For, without this information, the biggest single factor in the development equa. tion-how much foreign exchange there is going to be available for buying capital goods abroad after all prior obligations have been met -is necessarily an unknown. The Principle It is high time, therefore, that the advanced. countries of the world collectively embarked on a new policy regarding the treatment of the debt service obligations of the underdeveloped countries--a policy based on the principle that prevention of trouble is far better than cure. And there seems to be no reason why, in implementing this policy, they should not start from the standpoint that aid to the under-privileged areas of the world should not be allowed to contract from the levels at which it stood at the beginning of the 1960's after itaking into account changes in the flowback of money to them in.respect of the servicing of earlier assistance. If the advanced countries could afford to provide a net amount of, say, $8,000m. a year for this good cause in the 1950's when the price level was much lower than it is now and their own economic advance* ment had not proceeded so far,' there is no earthly reason why they should not do so now.",

   "text_content" : "FROM THE POINT of view of the Gas Council, the latest gas find in the North Sea could hardly have come in a better place or at a better time. The find confirms that the field, first found by Shell-Esso, is in fact extensive and the Gas Council was able to make its announce- ment just as the complicated negotiations on price are moving into a decisive stage. Inevit- ably, its hand in the talks will be considerably strengthened. Its interest after all is straight- forward. Once it became clear that there was in fact a lot of gas to be found under the North Sea, the Gas Council could con- centrate on getting as much gas ashore as quickly as possible at the lowest possible price. Fuel Oil Market On the oil company side the situation is more complex. Those that have substantial in- terests in this country want a high price for any gas they may have to sell, not merely because they wish to see their exploration efforts rewarded but also in order not to depress the market for fuel oil in which they have a large existing in- vestment. Some of the consortia operating in the North Sea, however-of which one has re- ported a commercial gas find- have little or no stake in the U.K. fuel oil market. While they naturally are also interested in getting a high return on their gas, they would be perfectly happy to see a price structure which enabled natural gas to compete vigorously against oil. *Even these companies, how- ever, hope to see something con- siderably more advantageous to them than the Gas Council's cost-plus proposals. It is of course true that one risk often associated with oil company operations is absent in the North Sea. There is no threat of political upheavals endangering the companies' investment. On the other hand, the companies can justly point to the fact that 'they are engaged in world wide operations, that their finds must pay for all the dry holes which are drilled, and also that experi- ence in the North Sea so far may prove them to have been quite exceptionally fortunate: That within a short space of time a gas flow of more than enough to cover the U.K.'s existing con- sumption has already been dis- covered may yet turn out to be a fluke. The proportion of dry holes could rise sharply. The companies have one more political argument for what they could consider a fair deal. If the British Government drives too hard a bargain with them, the Governments of oil-pro- ducing countries will certainly be encouraged to squeeze the oil companies harder. And the fact remains that no matter how rich the finds in the North Sea, even Britain-let alone all the coun- tries which have no access to cheap and indigenous sources of energy-must remain largely de- pendent on oil. From one point of view the British Government may well wish to sce a comparatively high price for gas. The coal industry s passing through a. difficult period in spite of the protection it enjoys. Some members of the Government may well wish to protect it against too much com- petition from'gas. This would undoubtedly be a wholly mis- taken approach. There may well be a social case for further. help to enable the coal industry to weather the transition from being the basic source of energy in the country to a situation where it supplies one particular form of fuel in a highly com- petitive market. There is no case whatsoever for attempting to do this by keeping all fuel prices in this country at a thoroughly uneconomic level. Cheaper energy The Government's objective must be to use the gas dis- coveries to bring down the cost of energy, first to industry and then to the private consumer and to afford the maximum relief to the balance of payments. This means setting a price structure which will on the one hand exercise downward pressure on competing forms of energy- fuel oil and coal-while at the same time ensuring that the oil companies continue to explore in the North Sea and exploit any and every commercial find."

But on the whole I think we must accept that the London Stock Exchange hasn't erected very reliable signposts over an extended period. This isn't a criticism of the Stock Exchange itself, which, except over the shortest period, fixes prices at its peril. Is it then a criticism of the British investment com- munity, which does fix the prices? A priori, the answer on the whole seems to be.no, for as we have seen in their North Ameri- can operations, given the right background and the right tools, our investors are no slouches at the game. Mind you, I think that, as in so many other dirctions, British conservatism has played a' part in this problem we are discuss- ing. Our investors got Great Universal Stores wrong when it would have paid abundantly to get it right because they thought the company was expanding too fast, was relying too heavily on borrowed money, would run into heavy bad debts, and so on.

Here again praiste be, ily a tiny handful oi companies is involved, and con. version, belatedly, is happening. Wroing Signposts But in general, for as long as I:can rememnber, it has been a tradition in Ite British company world to tell the investment com- munity as little as possible as seldom as possible. It has been accepted that if you overstate profits and assets you may finish up in the Scrubs, but that it is highly respectable and jolly conservative to understate them. Is it any wonder then that the Stock Exchange exaggerates, erects the wrong signposts? It would be unfair to mention names because this tendency has been so widespread. But it is a fact that a well-known business in 1947 told its shareholders, with a perfectly straight face, that the asset value of their shares was 63s 6d and that earn- ings were 454 per cent. on the Sequity. In 1948, the asset value was seen to be over Â£13, and equity earnings 250 per cent. It was the 1948 Companies Act, with its insistence on con- solidation, which wrought that transformation. In the ensuing twenty years (this seems to be the Snormal gestatory period between Companies Acts in Britain) things got better. But it would be foolish to pretend that the investor has been properly served since 1948. The spate of take-over bids which started in the early fifties brought some astonishing revelations about the real value of some companies' \"trade in- 'IL Sir Isaac Wolfson-ahead of the field. vestments.\" Such investments, which had, appeared year after year in the balance sheet at purely nominal figures, were onmetimes -AtAAddnl n when the investment was taken over, to be worth 10 times as much as shareholders had been led to believe. Moreover, this major reform of consolidation in company accounts which the 1948 Act brought can, in the new world in which we live, result in con- solidated company accounts now concealing more than they reveal. I have referred before this in these articles to the new generation of managers which has grown up believing passion- ately in diversification, that \" we can manage anything,\" and that where management teams have been built up they must never be broken up but must have new businesses bought, for them to run. Cases Quoted I'm not concerned here to judge whether this process has been successful or not. Dr. F. R. Jervis. in his recent booklet* quotes a whole string of cases where it has been publicly admitted that diversification has brought serious losses, but we just don't have the evidence on which to judge the trend as a whole. All I'm saying is that unless and until all diversifying companies \"account by divi- sions,\" giving capital employed, sales and profits for each, the in- vestment community and the Stock Exchange can hardly be expected to fulfil their proper economic functions, I could go on for a long whilet in this vein, discussing, for ex- ample, the economic repercus- sions of non-voting shares where such shares have resulted in the assets of a company not being deployed to maximum benefit and in the creation of self- perpetuating oligarchies; to the frequent lack of up-to-date valuations of fixed assets, which makes it impossible to calculate true return on capital employed; to the distortions in share values which can be caused by \"insider dealings,\" and so on. but there's a limit to my space. I must also acknowledge that the Stock Exchange itself has done a great deal to put these and other matters right, and that its lead has brought a very good response from the majority of the companies the shares of which it quotes. Lagging Behind But it seems to me that we still lag far behind the U.S. in this field (equally we are, with all our f faults, well ahead of many other countries). In these conditions it is not at all surprising that Stock Exchange investment has been mobre iitelligent and successful in the U.S. than it has been in; Britain over the last quarter of a century. It has too often been a sort of Blind Man's Buff, which may be good fun but is not calculated to make for an efticient and well run economy. I would like very much tol believe that the investment com- munity will be given the chance to do a better job by 1990. It will not do so unless and until we make up our minds whether we want capitalism to continue, let alone to work efficiently, or whether we think we can run Britain as a species of giant co-op. * The Company, the Share. holder and Growth, Institute of Economic Affairs, 7s 6d.",

Having lately assisted at the obsequies of what was once a most promising little company, 1 confess myself staggered at the complacency of the directors and the apparent impotence of share- holders. Notwithstanding that there had been an abrupt reversal of policy, that shareholders had been kept in the dark about crucial facts and crucial decisions. that the company had to be wound up, and that one of the principal directors had resigned, the rest of the management appeared quite contented and satisfied with themselves. All was smiles and affability. but not a single question we put to them was really answered, but only politely parried; and when we asked for a poll this was only agreed to after considerable argument. From first to lust, it was a case of \"Father knows best \" Even now, despite the appointment of a liquidator of the company, the directors propose to continue to exercise their powers.

   "text_content" : "Sir.-You report Mrs. Lilian Teague as stating at the TUC meeting that the attitude to the working woman in Britain was \"Victorian if not Oriental,\" May I point out that in that part of the Orient I know well, India, the attitude to the working woman is far from Victorian. Since the Independence of India, women in business, the professions and politics, have been given complete equality with men; ability, and not sex, being the determining factor. As a European woman running a manufacturing business in India, I have found absolutely no discrimination in operation against women. Not only do women enjoy equal opportunity but they are accorded, in addition, the respect that Indian men tradi. tionally ive their womenfolk. Certainly, in one very vital respect, married women are far better treated in India than in Britain, that is, in the field of taxa- tion. The earned income of a wife is taxed entirely separately. There appears no justification for the system operative in Britain that husband's and wife's income should be taxed together, and it is high time the women in Britain insisted that the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer should desist from exploit- ing marriage to enhance his coffers. It is also time that British women became aware that at least some of their Oriental sisters have far outstripped them in obtaining equality, economically and socially.

J. lndunstry spent two hbors with the Prhie Minister roIbleis. Seen here o arrival at 10 Downing Street BI director general; Sir Maurice Laing the president; ephen Brown, the president-elecL STORONTO, Sept. 19. Mr. Callaghan, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the Canadian Club of Toronto to-day that the Government regarded a permanent incomes policy as a necessary ingredient for success in keeping costs from rising and keeping prices down. \"Of course, the prices and incomes freeze is only short term,\" he declared. \"We are using the breathing space to work out a long-term policy to relate increases in incomes to increases in nrnodutivitv.\" productivity.\" Earlier at a Press conference the Chancellor had declined to esti- ifate the balance of payments deficit for the full year 1966, but asserted that the prices and incomes freeze was showing con- siderable results. He also said Britain's real output would not show the 2.5 per cent. growth rate of recent years in 1966. but neither would the gross national product fall. The Chancellor told the Club that Britain was being handicapped in the world toilay by a contrast between fact and opnion. \" Some times I can hardly recognise Britain beneath the misrepresenta- tion. Some of it is deliberate. Some of it just lazy. War on the Myths \"The time is here and now to declare total war on the new mythologists,\" he declared. \"The belief is that Britain is strike-ridden and undisciplined. The facts are that Britain's record compares favourably over the years with most other countries. \" Let us get strikes into perspec- tive. The facts are that in the five years 1960-64. the average days per year lost through strikes per 1,000 employed in Britain was 22. compared with 722 in the U.S. and 1,220 in Italy, to take two other countries for comparison. So much for that myth.\" Mr. Callaghan said another myth arose from our short-term indebtedness. \"The myth-makers here neglect the fact that at the last computa- tion Britain's gross overseas assets totalled well over Â£15' billion- second only to those of the U.S. Our gross assets exceed our gross liabilities by more than Â£2 billion,\" The belief was that productivity in British industry lagged behind everybody else. \"The fact is. that our own growth in productivity has been roughly in line with that in the U.S. and Canada. Some others certainly grew faster than we three. We are not satisfied with what we are achieving. We are taking very energetic measures on this in partnership with management and labour.\" The Chancellor reiterated his belief that Britain would have a surplus on international payments next year and predicted that a favourable trade balance could be maintained in future years. The austerity measures intro. duced in July would restrain demand and thus allow export production to accelerate with an easing of congested order books. He said British exports were risits this year but did not specify the rate of 9rowth. Unemployment At his Press conference the Chancellor denied a report pub- lished on Sunday in London that the Cabinet had been told that 750,000 workers would be unem- ployed In Britain soon saying that the real unemployment total would be \"nothing like that.\" Noting that Britain spends more per capita on overseas defence than any other country. Mr. Callaghan said: \"We must cer- tainly see to it that the burden on us in foreign exchange ceases to be heavier for us than for other countries.\" Mr. Callaghan is in Canada to attend the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Conference starting in Montreal on Wednesday, following which he goes to Washington for the international Monetary Fund meeting.",

   "text_content" : "Financal TimIes Reporter I The last fortnight has seen a maJor extension of British Rail's Freightilner services, with new routes from Glasgow to Man- chester and Liverpool. Freight liners only started running last November, after prolonged wrangles between BR and the unions, but even in its infancy it is already clear that the con- tainer concept is an established commercial success on the rail- ae initial service from Lon don to Glasgow was so popular that BR had to put on a second train in June to cope with demand. Unfortunately, further extension is limited by the rate at which the railway workshops can turn out the special low- loading container wagons. The next route, to Aberdeen for the Smithfield meat trade, is due in October, but will probably be delayed; and the full implemen- tation of the 100m. Beeching proposals of 1962 will probably take a good many years. Rising Steadily BR is now carrying over 600 containers weekly, and the number is increasing steadily. But more important is the fact that between 10 and 20 new customers are coming forward every week. many of them with traic which is quite new to the railways. Thus Freightliners are being used for electronic equip- ment, foodstuffs, beer, and gas and electric cookers. This traffic is precisely the kind that the railways have previously missed, either because they were too slow, too clumsy, or too expensive. The railway freight fare structure has meant that BR carried vast amounts of small packets of goods, and was only really competitive with road transport on heavy com- modities like coal or oil. The Freightliner will change this, and over stage lengths greater than 150-200 miles, BR should be able to offer cheaper rates for a wide range of goods. With its existing freight revenues falling steadily-by Â£8m. last year- mainly due to the declining use of coal in power stations, such a development is clearly crucial. The biggest advantage of Freightliners is that, unlike more obvious modernisation schemes such as electrification, the initial investment is quite small. London's York Way terminal, built on redundant railway land, cost less than Â£200,000, which compares with the Â£5m. to be spent on Euston. Freightliner terminals are very basic; York Way consists of a pair of massive mobile gantry cranes, which straddle the two tracks, and a parking area for lorries. A train of the high speed, flat, cars cost a mere Â£90,000, and the containers themselves anything up to Â£1,200, depending on' size and type. The cheap capital cost or Freightllners is reinforced by the very high productivity obtained from them. In the past BR has not been very con- corned about the intensity with which its freight wagons were used, and long idle lines of them were a common sigbt The idea, apparently introduced by Lord Beeching, that utilisation produces profit, enabled the total number of wagons to be cut by one third. The lesson has now been learned at Briish Rail, so that Freighttiner wagons are programmed to cover 500 miles a day each. With an average cruising speed of 50 mph and a top speed of 75. the trains can guarantee reliability-an important con- sideration in modem transport. Thus some firms using Freight liners may save between 10 and 50 per cent. on the London- Glasgow service. But; if, as for one firm it did, using Freight- liners means the elimination of a Glasgow warehouse, the sav- ing can be far greater. With the Freightliner, if with little else, British Rail can seri- ously claim to be ahead of most of the world's railways. The representatives of twenty-six .of these railways have in fact been to London to study the system, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and British Rail has been instru. mental in spreading the idea to the Continent. Next month, the Swedish railways will start a Stockholm - Gothenburg service and France, Germany,. Belgium, Italy and Switzerland will all have extensive networks. This network will be linked by the beginning of 1968 with Britain. under an Â£8m. scheme for Harwich-Zeebrugge container ships. By the time the Chanhel Tunnel is completed in 1974- 1975, container transport by rail should be the accepted pattern of transport for stages over 300 miles. The network of 50 British terminals should be complete, and it will be comparatively simple to ship a container from, say, Glasgow to Turin. Eventu- ally, the export-import trade of rail containers will probably be the most important rail traffic of all, for the relative economics of rail transport are better for longer runs. The big question mark hang- ing over the Freightliner scheme remains. British Rail initially refused to start the service because of union objection to allowing collection and delvery of containers by privately owned trucks. The terminals are still closed to any but British Rail vehicles, although the success of Freightliners sug- gests that BR's fears were not entirely justified. Nevertheless. flexibility is the essential key to the. attraction of the new service. British Rail's freight produc- tivity, in terms of ton-kilometres per man employed, is easily the lowest in Europe. Of course, this gives a very crude nseaur of efficiency, but in, 164 BR carried half the freight and less passengers than the Frprich railways; with ai larger staff. BR, at 70.000 ton-kilometres per employee,, compared badly with the 180,000 of the SNIC, the 140,000 of Deutsche Bundesbahn, and still worse beside the 225,000 of the Polish or the 255,000 of the Czech railways. Capital as well as labour costs are important for assess- ing productivity, but the Preinht- liner, needing only a iandful of men at the terminal and two on the train, could clearly gratly raise., overall produe. tivity. The Czech, and Polish figures show the advantages of having an overall authority which directs the most suitable traffic to the railways. It, is-to be hoped that Mrs. Castle's National Freight Authority will achieve this here, as well as spurring the British Rail Board on to greater efficiency. For the one criticism of the Frei ht. liner programme that can fairly be made is that havingtarted late. it is not being pressed ahead fast enough,",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF After a disastrous first half, Marley Tiles third quarter report shows a less disturbing shortfall in profits; Cawoods profits are lower, as forecast, but short-term considerations apart, the chairman is fairly optimistic (see Lex Page 1). Other results include a severe setback for Asam Frontier Tea and a slower growth rate for Lloyd Rakusen, which can apparently combine a \"restricted\" dividend policy with an actual increase in the payment. Vlyella is next in the queue for funds with a Â£5m. debenture Issue. Lloyd Rakusen It will \"be interesting to see what the Inland Revenue makes of Lloyd Rausen's dividend. The Board claims to have fallen in line but the actual payment works out at 11.45 per cent. against an adjusted 10.3. However, it is not surprising that confusion has arisen. There have been four scrip issues -all on a one-for-ten basis-dur- ing the past two years. The group's rapid growth rate slowed down in 1965-66, with pre-tax profits 6% per cent. better at Â£144,000 from a 15 per cent. rise in turnover. Whether or not shareholders will get the promised dividend remains to be seen but cover is comforting at 2.7 times. At present all departments are working to full capacity and a completely new production line comes into operation in December. This will not only take the strain off existing plant, but is expected to increase output per unit which should help to offset rising costs. And for a manufacturer of a wide range of dried foods, biscuits and packaged cereals, preserves etc., the credit squeeze may not be too troublesome. At 6s 6d the shares yield 3,6 per cent. and sell at 10.4 times earnings. Brewery Mixture The general run of brewery pro- fits this year has been disappoint- ing and Fremllns' half-year results to July 31 reflect this trend. Pre- tax profits have slipped from Â£477,000 to Â£444,000, although it is worth noting that this is Â£9,000 ip on the last half of 1965-66. Assuminp the same profits for the second six months the 15 per cent. dividend would be covered just over 1.3 times after a full tax charge. Like other companies Fremlins is battling against bigger overheads with little more than rationalisation benefits and slowly increasing sales at its disposal. But at least it has the resources to make the best'use of its assets- liquidity was over Â£680,000 at the last year-end and cash flow could be getting on for Â£230,000. With immediate prospects not too bright, the 5.7 per cent, yield and possible 13 P/E ratio is hoping that Fremlins will put its cash to good use, while acknowledging Whitbread's interest via the um- brella. The 1965-66 preliminary figures from Aylesbury Brewery, however, show that there are exceptions. The group has managed to reverse last year's setback with pre-tax profits up\" from Â£145,000 to Â£156,000 thanks to better sales and the 4conomils now flowing from a steady capital programme. And there are reasons why the group should continue to do well. The buoyancy of sales is partly ex- plained by the Aylesbury town ex' ansion. which is certainly a ueful factor and should make sure the froup's modernisation efforts are felt to the full.As far as SET s concerned the group's small pro. portion of managed as opposed to tenanted houses should limit the extra cost to a useful degree. Still the 5 per cent. yield on a main- tained 27% per cent. dividend at 28s is giving nothing away with cover at 1.4 times. Tayside Floor Just over a year ago Tayside Floorcoverings was still doing well, but the latest set of half-time results demonstrates the damage the squeeze can do. Despite diversification away from tradi- tional lino into plastic and stiletto- proof coverings, turnover is slightly down so far and clearly the autumn season is going to be a testing time. The first six months pre-tax profit amounts to only Â£38,000, against Â£65,000 and it looks as if the group will be lucky to make Â£70.000 overall this year. In anticipation, the interim dividend has been cut by a point to 3 per cent. and the final might get more severe treatment. On the basis of prospective earnings, a rever- sion to the 8 per cent. total of 1963-64 looks the best that can be expected. The unfortunate part is that poorer margins and weakening demand are beyond Tayside's con- trol. Expenditure on development has not been stinted in the past, but sound projects like the new PVC calendering plant are not going to help in the short-term. The number of debtors is too high for comfort and floorcovers are less likely to be renewed this year. Although no approaches have been made, there appears to be a grain of truth in the week-end rumour that, BritiAh Steel Con- struction is considering a bid. This put the share price up to 7s- not justified by a prospective P/E ratio of around 16% times and a possible yield of 5.8 per cent. Sale Tilney After a rise of four-fifths in pre- tax profits for the first nine months, it seems odd that Sale Tilney and Co. should forecast only Â£200,000 for the year against Â£212,000 pre- viously. This puts the group further back than square one. The prospectus estimate was Â£200,000 in February last year and the total will include about Â£25,000 from the recently acquired Compass House. The answer sems to be that by far the largest number of contracts are completed in the last quarter and the year as a whole is expected to he less profitable. Last year, about two-thirds of profits came from the industrial subsidiaries, with the original mer- chanting side lagging behind. The current pattern is similar, but a special item may well have an adverse effect on merchanting, while the industrial activities are feeling the effects of the squeeze. Margins are the problem at the moment for industrial turnover should show a year-end improve- ment. But the product range- including painting and .lighting equipment - does not rule out a drop in demand. On the basis of the forecast, cover for a main- tained 25 per cent. dividend is about 1.1 times. Up Is 3d to 13s Qd yesterday, the share price suggests that the market is satisfied by the fact that there is likely to be cover and the 9.3 per cent. yield and 9~ times PBE ratio are adequate pre- cautions.",

Even so with a 10 per cent, preference ranking ross for the first time the ordinary dividend s still sligntly short earned, Down 3s 6d to 12s 6d on the day Assam Frontier now yields a proe carious 13 per cent, so unless a big recovery can be seen this year the price could go a lot lower. ertainly Assam crops and prices have improved but it is too early for any firm Indication. Perhhap the most discouraging factor of all, however, is the iLsappointingly small amount of overspill reller, This means that even if Assam Frontier managed to recover the 1964 position the maximum dlvtl dend without dipping into reserves looks to be 1V per cent, This lifts the yield to a more repectable 8 per cent., but does nothing for the share price.",

The interi dividend is cut by 2 per cent. td't er cent.-the total for 1965 was 22 per cent. The profit reduction is attributable almost entirely to increased interest charges, arising partly from the need4 to finance additional stocks of land and work-in-progress and partly from the higher rates of interest prevailing, If no change in these rates occurs during the remainder of the year, it is estimated that for 1966 the group's interest charges will be some Â£90,000 higher than for 1965. say the directors. Thy add, however, that sales during the second half of the year normally exceed those during the first, and they are, accordingly, hope. ful that some improvement n prolt will occur during the six months to end 1966, It is pointed out that all interest is brought into account as a charge against revenue during the period TIn which It Is Icurred.

I ~ The National Canning Company has made a healthy start to the current financial year, with stocks at the lowest level for ten years. Furthermore, forward contracts entered into for many major lines were appreciably higher than at this time last year, says the chairman Mr. W. V. Smedley in his annual statement. Ua . -..#. U -.--, M. - 4 - --- He points out, however, that with a price freeze in force and increasing costs, it is difficult to foresee the net result upon an already modest margin of profit Production targets are appreciably higher than last year, and up to August 22 the rate was higher than twelve months ago. Sales of several of the company's most important traditional lines of canned vegetable show a \"most encouraging trend\" and Mr. Smedley says he has every reason for thinking it will continue. He confidently believes that the company will both produce and sell more than during the year ending May 31, 1966. In a more predictable political climate the chairman says he would forecast better profits with confidence, but in the present state of uncer- tainty such an unqualified prediction would certainly be unwise. The jobs tax will cost a sum of money and other inevitable price in- creases for materials and services. brought about by Government action of one kind or another, will have to be included in costs. As known, group profit, before tax, increased from Â£557,395 to Â£639,267. and the dividend is main- tained at 12I per cent.

   "text_content" : "By JOHN CHITTOCK ;Our Industrial Film Correspondent The 7th International Indust- rial Film Festval-held this year in enice--is over. This time, the films have been duller and drearier, the subjects more prdictable, than possibly ever before. The quality of the films is clearly a matter for concern. But maybe this is a passing roblem which in time could prove again. The blame, if thre is any blame rests more on the shoulders of sponsors than producers. It seems as if every company (wth a few exceptions) is determined to get its pound of flesh. And in the ensug cave-up, only skin and b:one are left to satisfy the viewer. This is a serious matter if the future of the documntary film is to be a useful one if film. indeid, is goin to fulfil the important social functions which now exist for it. At pre- sent, the average sponsor can see no farther than the walls of his own factory, and appears to believe that commercial success will come only through com- mercial attitudes. But industry is now the foundation stone of moder society. and in its films industry needs to take a broader-minded view of the world it is virtually governing. To be alive Extreme examples of these attitudes were to be seen in Venice in the U.S. entry. Ftrom Eastman Kodak. \"a salute to the tall ships\" followed this famous transatlantic race-with particular emphasis on the train- ing value of these sailing vessels. But far from taking a mature and penetrating look at the subject, this film treated it with superficial triteness-drop- ping in. for good measure, an occasional shot of someone taking home movies on a Kodak camera. Since nearly every film in this festival was shot on Kodak film, it seems a poor effort to present to grown men. Proof that U.S. sponsors can take a more mature view of life was seen in Johnson's wax film \"to be alive.\" Made originally for the New York World's Fair. this film takes an optimistic view of people and of life. For anyone faced with bankruptcy, suicide or tax problems, it ought to be compulsory viewing. Likewise, a British Petroleum entry from Belgium, took as its surprising subject pigeon racing. Yet this truly beautiful film. \"LesVoyageurs.\" does for its sponsors a great service: it shows working men in their leisure time; pursuing a work- ing man's sport with devout enthusiasm. And in doing this. it reveals the sensitive under- standing that British Petroleum t(n Belgium) must have for the people it depends upon. What greater achievement in industrial relations could a company wish for? These, of course, are films on popular subjects with a wide appeal. Yet the same philo- sophy applies to the highly specialised film or the commer- cially orientated production. In \"Die Migros Heute,\" for example, this isSss film surveys the monolithic might of Migros -who run everything from chain stores to joy through culture camps. The stated pur- pose of this film is \"public relations.\" In fact, the film seems so preoccupied with the goodness of Migros that it is unlikely to impress anyone other than Migros. Safety in cars In sharp contrast, Fiat have tackled a subject of vital public interest in \" Operazione Sicurezza.\" This film, about safety design in motor cars, is obviously close to the interests of the sponsors but the film has integrity, providing a valuable survey of its subject in an apparently objective way. In the beginning, this will benefit the viewer more than the out- rageously biased approach and in the end. it will also benefit the sponsor more. Fortunately, many delegates at Venice seemed to be aware of this need for a more respon- sible attitude to prevail in film sponsorship. But serious as this problem is, delegates were more concerned about broader issues relating to the recognition and use of the industrial film. For example, as one British delegate pointed out, support for this Festival tends to come from the same committed enthusiasts in industry. Viewing the Fiat film here was only one representative from the British motor industry - the films officer of Ford. Apparently the rest of the British car indus- try feel that the public relations activities of their competitors can be followed well enough from London. Fiat also issued to delegates a comprehensive catalogue of their films - printed in six different languages. And parked outside the festival cinema was a new Fiat car, which members of the world's press inspected with great interest. Films are made to be seen as well as to be judged and criticised, Yet this unique opportunity for British manage- ment to see. on film. what its rivals are doing, was grasped by a mere 80 delegates from the home country (of whom the majority had special con- nections with film anyway). Another matter which dele- gates seemed to feel particu- larly strongly about was the failure of Governments to take a greater interest in the value of the industrial film. In this respect, Britain trails a long way behind (only one repre- sentative from the Central Office of Information was here to sur. vey world activity in sponsored films). At present, the British spon- sored documentary probably leads the world-in quality and in usage. But there are signs that we may begin to lose this lead. The German films each year seem to deal more pre- cisely with solid technological subjects-superbly well, and in a way that must impress poten- tial customers. The Americans are pulling up their socks at last, and this year had some good films to balance the bad ones. A prize for the film most suited for television trans- mission was offered for the first time by Italian television, a recognition of industrial films that reflects an enthusiasm which is rare in British television. Even the Congo had a dele- gate at this festival, a man who appealed to producers to send industrial an' instructional fil: s to his country because they were important to the development of his nation. Time of ripening It is certain that all delegates in Venice felt that a time of ripening has come to the indus- trial film-and changes and pro- gress must occur quickly if the potency of film is not to be lost. No longer is it sufficient to make basic films about basic subjects, nor commercial films which show \" The Rigid Testing and Development\" of X. Y. Z's products. People expect more than that-from film and from industry. And certainly indus- try has many more useful func- tions to serve with film than those. Likewise, the time is ripe for an explosion in the use of the sponsored documentary film. Then, those who have failed to keep abreast with the medium will find that a long apprentice- ship in visual communications needs to be served in order to compete. Many of these, per- haps, will be those who failed to come to this important Festi- val Others may include the handful who spent more time on the beach instead of viewing film, but in business. ;nd in life, they will never compete or suc- ceed anyway. Industrial films reveal a lot- about business, life and people.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Shipping Correspondent The 14,000-tons P and 0 fast cargoliner, Strathardle-the first of three Â£2m. cargo ships to be built for P and 0 by Mitsui Shipbuilding and Engineering Company-was launched in Japan yesterday one month ahead of schedule. From keel-laying to delivery, in January next year, the build- ing in Japan of the Strathardle will have taken only seven months -one month earlier than the promised delivery. By the middle of next year she will be joined by her sister-ships, Strathbrora and airainiunuon. By contrast, building of similar sophisticated cargo liners in Britain have run into delivery diffi culties and the early delivery from Japan has more than justified the decision by Sir Donald Anderson, chairman of P and 0. to place the orders overseas in mid-1965. The P and 0 group needed early delivery since other operators, British and foreign, were operating faster cargo ships on the Far Eastern route. Within the next two years P and O expects delivery of 14 new cargo ships totalling 350,000 tons, and costing Â£31m. U.K. Delays A second 21-knot cargo-passenger liner, built for service between Europe and the Far East at a cost of about Â£2m.. was launched yesterday for Ben Line from the Clyde yard of Charles Connell and Co. (Ship- builders). Sir Douglas Thomson chairman of Ben Line Steamers said: \"This ship will be seven months late in delivery, which seems to be about the same delay as other owners. building in the U.K.. have been com- plaining about. \"Apparently ships built in Japan are a mere three or four weeks late. This is extremely disturbing, as if this sort of thing seeps right through in. dustry, we face industrial defeat from our overseas competitors.\" Sir Douglas said the effect of the wages freeze was immediately to put a stop to any new productivity arrangement. Shipowners had been hoping to mechanise and make more efficient their loading and discharging arrangements in the U.K. But he could see that labour would refuse to reduce the number of men in a gang. or otherwise increase pro ductivity, if they were to get nothing for it. They would be giving up their bar- gaining power for nothing. \"The effect of the wages freeze must then. it seems to me. but quite fatal to progress and improvement in British industry\" he said. Anoloeising for the delay in delivery of the Ben Line ship, Sir Charles Connell said: \"I can only say that the period since the signing of the contract has been one of the most difficult I have ever experienced.\" He added that the productivity agreement reached recently on the upper Clyde \"fulfils all theconditions for exclusion from the wage treeze laid down by the Government and is quite vital to the future of the industry.\" If it was included in the \"freeze\" it would be an \"unmitigated disaster.\"",

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter The Impalco Aluminium group, owned equally by Imperial Chemical Industries and the Aluminium Company of America (ALCOA), yesterday marked the end of a six-year expansion programme, worth Â£6m. and designed to cater for both U.K. and export markets. At the official ceremony welcoming Mr. George Thomas Minister of State for Wales, to the plant at Waunarlwydd, Dr R. L. P. Berry, managing director, said that the company was \"intent on beating world competition and gaining world markets.' Aluminum coil is reduced to inihe thickness on the fourgh tandem cold ll at the Impaleo Alumnlnum Group's Waonarlwydd Wutk& Net consumption of aluminium in the U.K. rose 24 per cent. during the past five years and there was no sign of any reduction in that hard-core expansion over the long-term. The company's plans did not rest on overall growth rates-it aimed to develop new markets and to win some big ones from the traditional ferrous, non- ferrous and non-metallic materials, Impalco disclosed. Material from the expanded Welsh facility would find ready markets in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Ireland. The oil pro- ducing countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf also offered good prospects for the Impalco aluminium range in industrial and domestic building materials. Other Impalco markets include exports of machining bars to Aus- tralia, fishpound boards for use in Canadian trawlers and a wide list of countries using the group's non-slip treadplate for flooring in vehicles, sac- tories and ships. \"'A widespread outlet for Impalco aluminium has been the Tote bin, the container component in a versatile bulk materials handling system sold by a member of the Impalco group, Tote Systems International. t has sold in Australia, Germany, Holland, Italy. Poland. Spain and Switzerland.\" the company revealed. The company hopes to achieve those aims with the trebling of capacity at Waunarlwydd, which is based op metal drawn from Norway and shipped to the Port of Swansea. It has introduced the latest type of strip mill and modernised work flow lines \"properly orientated from the hot line, through cold rolling to finish. ing processes, to warehouses and des. patch departments.\"",

Minister of Transport, openi long conference, endorsed the need for world.ide co- research for new skills techniques and resources \" All our skills and techniques must be international if they are to have any real validity,\" Mrs Castle maintained. \"And nowhere is this more true than in road construction.\" Britain to-day had the most acute traffic problem in the world, and was pushing forward with the biggest programme of road build- ing in its history. Projects Urged International research projects in which a number of countries would take Part were advocated by Mr. Robert Swala. president of the Federation. He visualised a project in which, for instance, a Canadian group investigated frost efects, a Spanis laboratory looked into special types of soil, a U.S. agency developed data on machines, Japanese engineers con. ccntrated on traf problems and a French group on bridges. He reported that the Federation's rogramme of codifying, documenting and disseminating the results or- research, which was expanded last year to cover 17 ountries, had nrther expanded this year to cover 16 additional countries. Other nations were expected.to join shortly. For the irst time in history, this year total hlghway expenditure by nations other than the US. is expected to be greater than the U.S. total, which was $13,2SOm. in 1965. The Federation estimated that nations other than the U.S. would increase their highway spending o the \"staggering\" total of nearly 2SO.0Cm. annually by 1970. Free Data Coent Ferdinand A-io, director general of the Federation, aid the ultimate aim must be to establish a world-wide system of statistics based on uniform terms and definitions and on a free exchange of data between all countries.

In a letter to Mr. Michael Stewart, Minister for Economic Affairs, he said that in spite of Government appeals there was ample evidence that many prices were rising, and the Prices and Incomes Board urgently needed more power to enforce its decisions in the prices field.

Introducing a report by the Central Committee of Study Groups based on the Duke of Edin- burgh's Commonwealth Study Conferences, Mr. C. F Guinness. an assistant managing director of Arthur Guinness Son and Co. (Park Royal), said in London yesterday that the question was whether status and the benefits asociated with it were essential to provide incentives to management and supervision, or whether they were becoming \"increasingly anachronistic and collectively pro. ductive of discontents.\" Anomalies The reporti based on the findings :mass Imgers or trade unionists e mn.d the day-to-day tasks o I .nt,, concludes that the noales are too often inherited rlis Ot an out-worn social and industrial system. Their removal would do much to remove, the petty disagreements and rsentjients that bedevil industry. ut there was no one solution :alth\",b the study groups agreed hat the most successful and qulckeat route is in most cses the holesale approach even if takes year*s of negotiation.\" ptigetmeal applftions often caused more anomalles than they removed. Employers would benefit through a more responsible and contented work orce with fewer disputes, lower absenteeism and labour turnover, easier recruitment as well as lower administration costs. Employees would benefit trom shorter working weeks and better pensions, holiday and sickness pro. visions, leading to more satisfaction at work, more security and better ocial status, A survey of 180 companies carried out by the Industrial Society (intro. duced simultaneously) shows that 36 per cent, of them intended to bring terms and conditions for white and blue-collar workers into line eventually; but only 29 per cent, were In the process of doing so. Same Treatment The policy of 11 concerns was to ive the same treatment to all mployes - the remainder were kin a \"piecemeal approach.\" electons were made on the basi of ength of srvice, for key jobs, or as rwards for good service.

Mr. Douglas Jay, President of the British Board of Trade, said to-day the level of Australia's tariff protection was difficult to justify now its industries were established. About 99 per cent. of Australian exports to Britain entered duty free but only about two-thirds of British goods entered Australia duty free. - Mr. Jay was addressing the National Press Club in Canberra. He said wide opportunity existed for freer trade between the two countries.. It was a fallacy to suppose that Britain must choose to trade with Europe or with the Commonwealth. Britain must in- crease trade with both and with many other countries as well, as must Australia. Despite measures to slow down overseas investment, British invest- ment in Australia was still rising and Britain would contihue to give Australia priority over non-strling countries, including Canada.

An Air France spokesman said yesterday that it was expected the aircraft would carry 450 passengers Fares should come down, making air travel possible for more people. It would also remedy some airport problems by reducing the number of aircraft arriving. . He stressed that the 747 order in no way detracted from Air France using the faster Concord supersonic airliners-which are currently esti. mated to cost Â£7.5m. each. Explaining the airline's policy, he said it felt the Concord would satisfy demand from people such as business. men who, in order to save time, would forgo the lower \"jumbo\" jet fares in order to travel in a supersonic air. -liner which could ctoss the North Atlantic in about half the time of subsonic aircraft such as the 747.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Four for Jarvis?",
   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN J. JARVIS. the veteran New- market trainer, continues his raid north of the Border this afternoon when he saddles four horses on the second day of the Edinburgh meeting. What is more, it will occasion little surprise if all four win. The first to come under starter's orders is Mattinata, a chesnut filly by Matador, who goes for the Buccleuch Apprentice Handi- cap (2.30). Maitinata has won two of her eight races this season, and though she is rather an in- and-out performer, she appears to be a cut in class above the Northern-trained sprinters who oppose her, and if she is in the mood to gallop she will probably carry topweight of 8 st 12 lbs to victory. In the next race, the Pinkie Stakes (3.0) for two-year-olds, Jarvis is represented by Aber. doran, a full-brother to last year's Goodwood Stewards' Cup winner, Potier. Aberdoran, a lean, whippety type, is unlikely to measure up to Polier's high standard. However, he has run with sufficient promise in good- class company to suggest that he is capable of taking an event such as this, and the sharp track at Musselburgh will suit him. DonbIrlstle, who runs for the Montrose Handicap (3.30), is not a horse that I care for, and he performed moderately in a handi. cap at Ayr last week. However, the distance then was 1% miles, and in his previous race, over a mile at Newmarket, he battled on well to get the better of Charlotte Stuart, Georginka and the sav- ourite, Fouette, form that suggests that he is reasonably treated here with 9 st. Finally, Mountain Ash, in spite of being called on to concede 18 lbs to the horse weighted immediately below him in the Barnbougle Nursery Handicap (4.30), is a confident selection, for his form when defeating Bayarin and Queen's Proctor over seven furlongs at Sandown in July was distinctly useful, and since then he has run well in a valuable mile nursery on the same course. At Leicester, that enthusiastic owner, Mr. Robert Morley, will be hoping that Greek Skittle will enjoy his fourth victory of the season in the Kegworth Nursery Handicap (2.0). Greek Skittle has a fair chance but I am doubtful about his ability to concede 15 Ibs successfully to Power on whom D. Letherby claims the 3 lbs allow- ance. Ghyll Manor, who slaughtered Caronbrook at Yarmouth last month, is selected for the Charm wood Handicap Plate (3.30) and I. Cross, on the balance of orm, appears to be reasonably treated in the Loughborough Handicap (4,0).",

However, the results of the first two outsteps were disappointing, and the Gas Council-Amoco find will help to restore confidence in its potentiality. There is a shortage of all forms of drilling equipment in the North Sea, and the Gas Council-Amoco group itself has the. use of only one platform at present, the Orion. Consequently there is little doubt that it would prefer to concentrate its activities for the moment on developing its other find in block 49/18, and leave 49/26 and 49/27 to Shell-Esso. The latest discovery could not have come at a better moment for the Gas Council. The negotiations with the oil companies over the rice at which it should buy North Sea gas are moving into their most critcal phase with the terms of the contracts expected to be announced either in late October or early November. To strengthen the case for a low price the council wants to be able to show that it has been established beyond doubt that the North Sea contains large quanttites, while the oil companies are emphasising the fact that there is still plenty of risk in the operation. Amoco is A subsidiary of Standard Oil (Indiana) and the other members of the group are Amerada, a U.S. company in which the U.K. Government recently sold a large number of shares, and Texas Eastern Trans- mission.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Textiles Correspondent The emergence of cotton textile industries of \"considerable efficiency and sophistication \" in many of the developing countries was emphasised by Lord Brown, Minister of State, Board of Trade, wra VÂ«iJ1nQasi Vu uA rUÂ»u jwurWu, I in London yesterday. \"The pendulum has swung so far that the developing countries are now among the world's leading exporters, will all the stresses and strains which such a development is bound to create, and which the GATT Long-term Arrangement is designed to alleviate,\" he stated. 200 Delegates Lord Brown was opening the annual meeting of the Interna- tional Federation of Cotton and Allied Textile Industries, which is being attended by over 200 dele- gates from about 20 countries. Recalling that in 1913 the British cotton industry Was pro- ducing five times as much cloth as it does to-day, and exporting no less than 30 times as much, Lord Brown said the rate of tech- nological change was remarkable and the textile industry was no exception. overnment limitations on cotton textile imports would give the British insry a breathing pace between now ad the end of 1970, at t same time allowinl exporting countries a far larger share of the domestic market than was the case in almost any other country in the world, be added. Mr. Cbrister Hoeglund, of Sweden, president of the federation, discussing the problem of structural change in world textile production, said some countries might have to make further cuts in capacity, others might find they had attained optimum sze, and there might be some left in which some expansion of existing or erection of new capacity might be justified. Mr. Hoeglund argued that profit ability and pice consciousness were vital problems for all textile indtis tries. If prices were related to true costs, and if textile enterprises took part in foreign trade only if they could ensure a reasonable return on capital, the problem of structura- adjustment would be solved. Lack of price consciousness was one of the main causes of disruption of markets, either by competition at abnormal prices among domestic mills within the same country, or by distorted competition in foreign trade. In either case it was not only un- necessary but simply bad business.",

   "text_content" : "It has become traditional for visiting Russian compaies, after they have shown us their full- length ballets, to present a mixed bill consisting largely of divertisse ments: excerpts from the classics, national and character dances, ari concert-party items. The Kirov programme on Saturday and Mon- day, however, was closer-two- thirds closer-to the \"triple bill\" of western companies. It opened with Chopiniana, continued with Igor Belsky's Leningrad Symphony, and only then moved into the familiar pot-pourri. Chopiniana is the earlier name of Les Sylphides. Fokin mounted the ballet in 1908. for Preobraz- henska (Prelude), Karsavina (Waltz), Pavlova (Mazurka and Waltz pas de deux) and Nijinsky. In Leningrad it has survived not quite in the form that we know (in any case, Fokin revised his choreography more than once) but in a version which is more surpris- ing for its correspondence than its differences. The instrumental pre- lude, incongruously, is the A major Polonaise in martial orches- tration, trumpets, trombones blar- ing the middle section, sidedrum; but the curtain rises on the familiar romantic tableau, the poet surrounded by the sylphs (kin's \" twenty-three Taglionis who seem as much the emanations o his imagination as independent beings. The company dance this rverle romantque in the most beautiful style. Kolpakova is at her most perfect and delicately precise, drift- ing in long, lyrical exquisitely drawn lines through the pas de deux, using her marvellous balance to float the Prelude. Komleva's soft, sure leaps in the Waltz, and the bright buoyant Mazurka of Nina Gruzhdeva were the perfect complement. On Saturday Sem- yenov's poet was unfailingly cour- teous, graceful but never weak. Vikulov s last night was even more romantic, more rapt. The male variation is danced, as by Nureyev, to the C major Mazurka Op. 33 No. 3, not the more usual Op. 67 No. 3 in the same key. Leningrad Symphony was the Kirov's modern ballet some five years ago, the work we hoped they would bring with them then. It is a very impressive piece, a shattering one indeed: heroic, &alenya reamcncvu churning up one's emotions as powerfully as Shostakovich's 'war\" symphonies do when the Leningrad Philharmonic plays them. The score is the first move- ment of the Leningrad Symphony, an episodic (but integrated) stretch of music which falls into clear sections, matched in Belsky's choreography. The exposition is inspired by \"happy, regular life . . .The main theme Is the love for people that has become the bulwark of culture, civilisation and life.\" The first subject is set for men. joined by girls in the more flexible, lyrical second theme (treated largely as a pas de deux). Then the \"fascist episode\" begins: at first a distant mutter which grows into the advance of a screaming, strident war-machine, shattering the world depicted in the exposition. Belsky's movements for the Nazis are imagined with extraordinary vividness, drawing now on a stylised goose-step, ruth- lessly precise, now on an obscene, bestial wallowing. These creatures seem bloated with evil, dripping with foulness. The patternings of their advance are brilliantly laid out as is the assimilation of naturalistic gesture, brutal licence and military precision into choreo- graphic images of hatefulness and destruction. With a boldness that succeeds more completely than any descrip- tion of it could possibly suggest, the invaders are opposed not by any realistic struggles, but by heroic male dancing. Crudely put, Soloviev throws double-turns at the enemy! The effect is of a radiant, glorious affirmation of noble ideals; light in darkness; courage in adver- sity; confidence in a final victory. Shostakovich's recapitulation takes the form of a threnody; it is danced by the women--chiefly by the soloist, in movements expres- sive of noble grief, large, searing and tragic. Touchingly, she recapi- tulates alone th esteps which as pas de deux closed the exposition. There is a ray of light at the end, but finally a new matter of menace: \"the war is not over.\" Shostakovich found his resolution in three further movements: \"Memories.\" an intermezzo of untroubled days before 1941; a shining Adagio, an image of beauty at the other extreme from the \"fascist episode\"; and finally \"an Ode to freedom, joy, and victory won.\" One could hardly expect Belsky to set the whole long symphony. By ending where he does he leaves, no doubt by intention, a disturbing impression, a warning: the fight against fascism is not yet completed. Thw setting the costumes the lighting are as bold and successful as the choreography. Leningrad Symphony has the directness of most Soviet art and the nobility and vigour of its most elevated pro ductions. Some of the imagery is simple in the style of popular posters or patriotic statuary, bul none of it is unworthy of its tre mendous theme. On Saturday Soloviev was the magnificent hero and Fedicheva at her most eloquent and impassioned as the heroine. Last night's couple were Sokolov, less poetic but a con, vincing enough hero, and Kom leva with great lyricism of move ment. The divertissements brought ne surprises, but the expected quots of brilliant, firmly moulded, un flaggingly bouyant dancing ir varied styles. Rut after the romantic beauty Chopiniana, ant then the impact of Leningrad Symphony. it was hard to tuni into fragments; perhaps the! Sshould have been presented first.

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON Mozart and Beethoven made up the programme of this recital: Two Fantasias and the A minor Sonata (K.210) of the former, the Appassionata and the A flat Sonata Op. 110 of the latter. The scheme was typical of Annie Fischer, a deeply serious and committed pianist who makes no concessions either in choice of works or in style of performance. Miss Fischer has superabundant nervous energy, mental and physi- cal, of a kind that might be described as masculine were it not found just as often in women musicians. Indeed, few men would have the temerity to attempt so highly charged a performance of the Appasslonala as Miss Fischer gave last night. \"Attempt\" must he the word because In the outer movements it fell short, 'not in its conception, which was noble, but in execution, Miss Ficher lunged at the key- board like a sunburnt Valkyrie, hurrying and pushing the opening phrases so much that the first movement never settled down. The turbulence was there but not the grandeur and the span - this mattered far more than 4he wrong notes, of which there were a con- siderable number, In the last few bars things suddenly went right as the pianist found the right pace and the right, mysteriously veiled tone for the close. The mood re- mained with her for the Andante, played with all the warmth and readth that had hitherto been lacking. It was intermittently recaptured in the finale, where Miss Fischer cut the main repeat and set herself a speed In the coda that proved hard to maintain. There had been similar inequalil ties in Op, 110. The fugue was started with serene, singing legato and was firmly built up to the first climax, but the tone at the end of the movement, when the fugue sub- ject returns In triumph, became harsh and clangorous. The Mozart Fantailas (one of them, K.396 in C minor, left unfinished by Mozart and completed by the Abbd Stadler) were strong, unaffected and rather lacking in antasy, or at least in the sense of improvisa- tion implied by the title, Miss Fischer went straight to the heart of the stormy first movement of the A minor Sonata. but the finale would have been twice as eloquent if it hadn't been pressed so hard.",

   "text_content" : "by DENYS STTN Editor of Apollo ICourwey V. & A. Design by Charles Rickett# for the Trial Scene of Henry VIII The exhibition devoted to Charles Ricketts and the theatre, which has been arranged at the British Theatre Museum, Leigh- ton House, Kensington (open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Satur- days), is well worth visiting. Although modest in scale, it serves to commemorate one of the most gifted and original men who have worked for the stage in this country. Stage design, however, was only one of the many activities of this highly intelligent and perceptive artist. Ricketts. who was born in 1866, had a French mother, and Colin Agnew, who remembers him well, tells me that in conversation he gave the impression of being a Frenchman. Both his parents were keen musicians and Ricketts' journals and letters, which were published by Mr. Cecil Lewis, reveal how much music meant to him. As a young man, for instance, he had the opportunity of hearing Verdi conduct a performance of his Requiem at the Albert Hall. Ricketts had an informal educa- tion. At the age of 16, he became apprenticed to a wood engraver called Roberts who taught at the City and Guilds Technical Art School. It was there that he met Charles Shannon, who was to become his life-long companion. After a brief visit to Paris in 1887. where the two men met Puvis de Chavanmies, they took Whistler's old house in The Vale, Chelsea. It was to become, as Oscar Wilde later said, the one house in London where you will never be bored. The two young artists made their mark by publishitg a review called The Dial. This had the effect of introducing them to Wilde, and Ricketts painted a \"fake\" sixteenth- century portrait to serve as the frontispiece for an edition of the Portrait of Mr. W. H. Ricketts and Shannon became in a sense official artists to Wilde, illustrating ,various books by him as well as designing bindings. These must be counted among the most elegant productions of the period. In 1896, on the basis of a legacy from Ricketts' grandfather and a loan from a lawyer friend called Hacon, the two men started The Vale Press. This was to become one of the most important private presses of the age and the books produced by them were not only beautiful in themselves but com- mercially successful. An analysis of their style indicates a relationship to Art Nouveau. In 1904, however, they gave up the Press and devoted most of their time to painting. However, it was typical of Ricketts' virtuosity that it 1903 he undertook a commission to write a book on the Prado, which still retains its value. His most important literary achieve- ment was his masterly volume on Titian, which warrants reprinting. This well-phrased book, published in 1910, contains many profound remarks about the artist and is particularly interesting where the Venetian's technique is concerned. Ricketts wrote on other themes -Japanese art, stage design, Puvis de Chavannes. for instance. All his essays possess individuality and he never hesitated to speak his mind. He was opposed to Impres- sionism and even if his views about moder art are now out of fashion, his emphasis on the importance of continuity does not lack relevance for our period. His debt to tradition is acknow- ledged in his own painting, and a shade too warmly. He learnt much from Titian and Delacroix. Yet it could well'turn out that his pictures have more quality than is now acknowledged; the trouble is that when a painter's work is in the doldrums, as is certainly the case with that es Ricketts, then it is by no means easy to see enough to be able to achieve a balanced view. When Ricketts turned to stage design, he was not hampered by his respect for tradition. Moreover, the fact that he had to produce work quickly was an advantage. The theatrical drawings in this ex- hibition have considerable power; their colour is strong and show that he understood the technical prob- lems of stage-craft, It is particularly interesting to find that he collaborated with Leon Bakst on the designs for Arnold Bennett's play Judith in 1909. This was three years after Ricketts began to design for the stage and his work stands the chal- lenge of the comparison. It was one of his major contributions that he realised that the designer must not seek to impose a conception but to work out a design which suited the mood of the play. His essay on stage design is brilliant. At an early date he and Shannon had been fascinated by Japanese art-a legacy from Whistlerian aestheticism. It was most appro- priate, therefore, that in 1926, five years before his death, he should have had the opportunity to design for The Mikado. His design for the costumes and sets are still in use, so the catalogue points out. He also did the costumes for The Gondoliers, and the exhibition con- tains various drawings and letters by Ricketts which have been lent by Miss Bridget D'Oyly Carte. Ricketts and Shannon have another claim on posterity. They were discerning collectors and managed to build up a superb col- lection on very slender means. One of their major acquisitions was Piero di Cosimo's The Fight be- tween Lapiths and Centaurs now in the National Gallery. \"Frozen\" Royalties Counsel for the Performing Right Society told a tribunal in London yesterday that the society had given an undertaking not to implement any increase in royalties until the end of the economic \" freeze.\" The statement was made during the hearing of an objection to a three-tariff scheme for the perform. ance of copyright music at variety shows, revues and pantomimes. The objection, brought by the Theatres National Committee, was heard by the Performing Right Tribunal. I\" - -",

   "text_content" : "by BEN WRIGHT A distresing aspect of watching s1 -of for a living is the far too s5 requent lash of dates which a forces a choice between two f eqully intiguing events and un- wllng rejection of one or the 1 other. Surely it is high time the t Royal and ncient, the national c unions and the PGA got together i to arrange the calendar so that clashes like that which occurred last week between the Dunlop i Masters tournament at Lindrick and the Amateur International matches at Royal Porthcawl can 1 be avoided, i Having chosen to return to a Lindrick of happy memories-few will ever forget our last Ryder i Cup victory there in 1957-it was fitting that Nell Coles (Coombe Hill) should gain the victory that had so narrowly eluded him in the past fortnight. He would be the last to claim that he is an exciting performer. His merit lies in his extraordinary consistency when conditions are to his liking. It is then that his placid progress -shoulders hunched, hands in pockets-strikes fear and various other emotions into his rivals as he gradually wears them down. I well remember my first im- pression of Coles, gained when he had the misfortune to be inflicted with myself as partner in a pro- fessional-amateur competition on the eve of the first Cox Moore tournament in 1961. In those days Coles was still a player of great promise on the verge of the im- Sportant breakthrough he was to accomplish that year. I recall that round at Wollaton Park, Notting- ham, so vividly because even my antics on that wet and windy morn- ing failed to shatter Coles' concen- tration or his game-until the final Shole. Long before we reached this stage, however, I had become e convinced that as a striker, Coles Salready had few equals in this ' country, and that his utterly im- Sperturbable temperament would n serve him well. I tested both to L the full. e If memory serves me right, the first hole on this pleasant park- Sland course measures a little over t 400 yards. On this occasion, a cold wind was blowing in our C faces, however, and I was par Y ticularly relieved to hit a gentle Sdrive straight down the middle. 4 This was followed by a 4-iron shot e which cheated the wind-I suspect, * but did not see-because contact Swas established briefly with the W upper rather than the lower half of the ball, which rolled just through the green. For shots-if tha4,is an appropriate word-later, I id still failed to reach the putting surface, having shanked the ball around its edge in a well-nigh per- feet semi-circle. As any golfer knows, it is an unwritten rule of the game that the mention of the word \" shank\" or \"socket\" is strictly forbidde.g in the presence of a tournament player. To execute these shots so perfectly, the most dreadful and lingering affliction a golfer can suffer, adds insult to injury, and is enough to make any professional tear out his hair. I add hastily that Coles did not lose his on that fateful morning, however. Instead he took this, and several similar indiscretions by his partner, in his ambling stride. And such was the accuracy, not to speak of the length, of his driving that it was impossible to tell on which side of the fairway his ball had pitched Only two putts of about 4 feet-, which he missed, proved Coles td! be something more than an auto- maton-until that final hole. At this stage the rain had be- come torrential, and your corre- spondent positively flushed with pride at somehow producing the only par 3 our party could man- age at the short 17th hole. I thereupon hooked my last drive over deep-mid-wicket, and ruefully followed in Coles' wake down thqy fairway, whence he had struck his drive with customary accuracy. To my astonishment, Coles promptly produced a replica of my dreadful drive with his 7-iron, ran up a seven, and finished wealthier in experience but just out of the money. Had he been practically any other professional in the field, I'm sure he would have resolved there and then never to partner me again. But at lunch he was pleasant and placid as ever. Ironically it was Dave Ragat, the charming American who stayed in the same splendid but almost empty Sheffield hotel as myself last week and who finished down the field at Lindrick, who inflicted on Coles his first defeat in Ryder Cup singles in 1963. Since then Ragan has known hard times, his game having cracked up completely after he recovered from an eye ulcer. Now he wears spectacles, and is making a successful comeback. After his second round of 79 in the Dunlop Masters, however, in which he played several destructive drives, he denied himself lunch and adjourned to the practice ground for three hours in the most u41 pleasant weather, as a sort of penance.
