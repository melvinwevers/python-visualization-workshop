   "text_content" : "By Owr SbWppn Coaerpomdmg Brttih Overseas Airways Corpotion s boybuf, for Â£Ulm. cah, the 30 per cent. latert ta BOACConud hed by Canard SteamaSUp Company. BOAC-Cunard operates on the most profitable of BOAC routes-the transatlantic sector covering the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and the American mid-west, together with Central America and the northern part of South America. The decision by Cunard to sell its interest is based upon the need by Cunard for cash to invest in container ships, develop the company's tanker subsidiary and reorganise its passenger liner operations. BOAC-Cunard was formed ii mid-1962, with BOAC contribut ing. 70 per cent. of the capita and Cunard the remaining 3( per cent. The' authorised capita was Â£30m. with Â£28m. sub scribed--19.6m. by BOAC anc Â£8.4m. by Cunard. Share of \"Jumbo\" jet bill By ending the BOAC-Cunard agreement now,. Cunard Steam Ship also avoids 'the necessity ol fining several millions of pound! in the years ahead as is share of the bill for big new aircraft. BOAC itself has already ordered six Boeing 747 \"Jumbo'\" jets, costing around t55m., and although it is not yet firmly com- mitted, it is likely also to buy the Concord supersonic- airliner, at over Â£6m. a time. Some part of thes big new feets would be used on the North Atlantic and, accordingly, had ABOAC-Canard survived; Cunard eulf would have had to put up its are h ne for that Development cost burden Thert is no precise means of knowing what this would have amounted to. but it would certainly have been several mil- lions of pounds by the end of this decade, with the prospect of more to be found in the 1970s as air travel continued' to expand. Sir Basil Smallpece, chairman of Cunard,. who was managing director of BOAC in 19.6 and was one of the irinceal architects of the BOAC-unard pat, still recog- DaIS the importance of aviation, end the bi lvdends that it could provide. But, as he told THi FINANCIAL riMES last night, Cunard cannot afford Ihe development funds In- volved,and reluctantly he now has to disiantle from the Cunard side ;he alrement he made when he wai at BOAC. Sir Basil also made It clear that while Cunard still holds a 40 per ;ent, lnterest in British Basle Inter. latlonal Airways, the independent irllne the chairman of the latter 4r, Harold Bamberg, has the )ption to buy that shareholdin ind has indicated hat he Intends o do so, Thus, It is expected that Se Moe and Mtters PI n Cunard Steam-Ship will completel! sever its aviation connections. Sir Basil also told Ton FNAN ScIL TIras last night that the dif d ference between the purchase am I sale price of the Cunard holdinj I in BOAC-Cunard-just over Â£3.1m -was represented mainly bi Cunard's share of retained profit in the company. After October 15 the air route operated previously in the nanme of BOAC-Cunard will be 100 pei I cent BOAC operated. i- Capital for f container ships SIn a message to Cunard stock- Sholders Sir Basil says: \"This is a I positive step forwerd in our plan to pay our way. It will provide capital required for a wider adop tion of containerisation of cargo vessels, for the development of our small tanker subsidiary, and for the reorganisation of our passenger operations. !'~i is inevitable that we shall have to invest large sums in these projects.\" .t -a thtteafa; ofr or f Cunard at this time is in the lonp- term interests of all concerned in Cunard.\" Investment in the shipping busi- ness was vital and the deal with BOAC gave Cunard more money to finance it. Tied to the Q.4 contract Cunard is tied to a contract price, which may range between Â£25m. and Â£30., on the building of the Q.4 liner for delivery in 1968. This is a ship which Sir Basil, if he had been in charge at the time at Cunard, may not have ordered.. But he is tied to this contract and is now trying to develop Cunard as an operator of holidays afloat rather as a point. to-point shipping operator. In its negotiations with BOAC, Cunard was advised by S. 0. War. burg and Co. Cunard is confident .that it will be possible to employ the llym. sale proceeds to greater advantage elsewhere in the group, saysn annnouncement to Cunard shareholders. It adds that the purchase agreement provided for a continuation of joint selling arrangements - \"Air-sea Inter. change will continue and be strengthened.\" ige 14 and LAX this page f ii ti Ii n C N 81 Ii rr II Ih 6a roix a Z a",

Mr. Heath's Request Mr. Wilson said the Government would consider Mr. Heath's requesi for the recall of Parliament. But he thought that for Parliament to be recalled there would have to be some change in policy, such as a decision to use force, or a settle ment, or a decision by Britain to wash her hands of the whole thing. Mr. Wilson made it clear that he would regard a Royal Commis. sion, or an ascertainment of the views of all political leaders as acceptable democratic alternatives to a referendum when it came to testing whether a settlement was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole. But rejected an Indaba of chiefs. The Prime Minister pointed out that he had not used the word ultimatum. There was no specific deadline, but he wanted action before the end of the year, while the UN General Assembly was still aitting. This would leave adequate time for Informal disculsinns. and for people in Rhodesia to make up their minds. \"We are getting a little tired of .carrying the can.

(They are Nigeria, Uganda and New Zealand.) \"Survived\" \"The Commonwealth has sur vived a critical test despite the intensity of our feelings and the differences that divide us.\" Mr. Wilson summed up the conference. It might even be the case that it would have been strengthened-it all depended on the stresses and strains of the next few weeks.

The new debentures and loans bene sited as well, enhancing furthe. the prospects of the big IC issue. In very idle conditions, equities showed more backbone and the share index ended 1.6 higher on the day at 3042. BOAC-Cunard The Government's dislike of Cunard's 30 per cent share in BOAC-Cunard has coincided with Cunard's liquidity squeeze to pro- duce the sale of that holding to BOAC for Â£11 m. cash. This is obvious sense for Cunard. It would have been landed with 30 per cent of the bill for BOAC- Cunard's forthcoming re-equipment when it needed all the cash it could lay its hands on to finance the cargo ships required for con- taiderisation. The price, related to, BOAC-Cunard's Â£33m. of net assets, is equally respectable in terms of profits, representing 12% times earnings ex-investment allowances. Cunard intends to retain the cash, and though this is good for the group long termi it is not going to do anything for the share price short-term. The drive into :ontainerisation will not produce hijher profits over the next coupl- of years. The only move that could quickly achieve this is the elimination of the losses of Â£.7m.; on passenger ships last' year'whic. dragged group profits dow#tb oa 200,000 before tax.

Sales at the half-year h.ve risen from Â£3.65m. to \"over\" Â£3.75m. and margins have gone up with a bang producing pre-tax pro- fits of Â£455.000 against Â£305,000. The interim is raised a point at 6% per cent. but whether the total for the year will be higher depends on the state of the freeze next March. The reasons why Reichhold is bucking the trend set by ICI and Albright are not hard to find. For one thing it had a bad time, last year with a jump in raw material prices and breakdowns or delays on the plant side. These probleus have now been corrected. Secondly it avoids the troubles its much larger brethren are expedrncing with their vast capital programmes. Reichhold's steps in this direction are more modest-additional capa- city has come in smoothly so far this year with the desired effect on margins. Finally the group's strong card is its concentration on resins rather than basic chemicals. Thus Reichhold stands a good chance of at least equalling its per- formance two years ago when pro- fits in the first half were Â£400,000 before tax and Â£794,000 for the year, against Â£596,000 in 1965. Even if 1eichhold does no better than thai the shares, despite a 2s rise to 13s 3d, are selling at only 10 times prospective earnings to yietd 6.75 per cent. Both are better than the chemicals average when Reichhold is showing every sign of leaving the average chemicals per- formance well behind.

   "text_content" : "By Ow Commodithes\"Sh&-- Â· DESPITE booming tin production, heavy sales from the U.S. tin stock- pile and only routine consumer buying, tin prices continue to hold remarkably steady. Last night the cash price of tin on the London. Metal Exchange closed at Â£1,221 10s a ton, a fall of Â£2 10s on the day and a net fall of only Â£3 10s in the past three weeks. The market, in fact. is finding the lack of any significant move ment in tin prices completely bewildering. The general feeling is that values should be slowly but definitely drifting downwards. The gap between world produc- tion and consumption continues to narrow. Latest estimates see a shortfall of only 10,000 to 12,000 tons at the end of this year. com- pared with a gap of some 15,000 tons at the end of 1965. At the same time, although sales from the US. General Services Admi. nistration tin stockpile are reported to be running at only half the rate which would be required to get rid of the 28,000 tons allocated for sale by next April nevertheless the current level still means that some 14,000 tons win be added to world supplies, 2.000 to 4,000 tons more than seems likely to be required to meet the shortfall in world production. At the same time, the outlook for consumption is not encouraging. One of the economy's most sensitive baro. meters, the motor industry, is already declaring men redundant. Tin's most important use is in food canning, an industry which should be the last affected in any squeeze. But the metal also has important outlets in the elec- trical, chemical and engineering indus- tries, an ber. op trends unaffectsd. l to remn In fact, only three reasons can be put forwakd to explain the steadiness In tin pries. The substantial r sorces of the International Tin Agreement bffer stock, the manaler of which may support the price at Â£1,200 a ton; continued uncertainties over sterI (in the past, tin as been widel ud as bed t Isterl. ing devalation); an perps simply a eral lack of nterest in the The recent meetin of the Inter national Tin Councl in Kinshba (Congo) prodced no news of signif cance.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Editor THREE of Zambia's seven copper mines are still affected by the strike of African mineworkers des- pite the-Government's acceptance on Wednesday of workers' demands over pension funds. It was reported from Lusaka yes- terday that the mines still affected were Mufulira and Luanshya, owned by the Roan Selection Trust, and the Anglo-American Corporation's Rhokana mine. The position was virtually unchanged, except at Luanshya, where more men were out than before. / Some of the miners, particularly in the more skilled trades, were believed to be disappointed by the Government's decision that money paid into mine pension funds be paid back (in phases) before they joined a national provident scheme at the end of this month. \\ They felt that their money would be safer in the pension fund than in their pockets. Observers also believe one reason for the strike persisting is a reaction against the Government, which prosecuted a large number of men at Mufulira and Luanshya for failing to do essential work. The three-week old strike at one time involved almost all the Afri- can labour force of 37,000 men, and has cost the country a great deal of revenue in lost production. At the present time, about 12.500 men are still on strike. On the London Metal Exchange, buyers were cautious pending fur- ther news of the Zambian labour situation. There was considerably reduced activity compared with the previous day, and the price As three months wirebars closed at S401 10s a tbn-a rise of Â£1.",

Few farmers cost these separately, but this sort of live- stock, which can be successfully kept in an obsolete cotton mill or other nonaricultural place should always be charged the full market price of any of the farm's produce n they consume. Otherwise there is , no means of knowing whether the f land or the livestock is making the c profits. a It is essential to recognise the r physical and financial obstacles to r increased production from land. a In cereal growing, for instance, the s physical limit is at the moment f about 30 cwts of . grain, either J wheat or barley, an acre. This is I a long way below what many I farmers claim to achieve, but it is i the Ministry's estimate, and I think fairly accurate. This yield will i return just under Â£40 an acre at present prices. In point of fact the need to kill weeds and break the disease cycle 1 means that cereals cannot be grown every year. Cash crop to alternaste with cereals are.

The 1 aped n^' 'oc thewe are I S arai eed rdOtsled to stock do not provide anything like the ~ash return of a crop o barley. I So the specialist grain grower will probably have an overall farm Sihomnte of a ,ood deal nearer Â£35 Sor even Â£30 an acre at present Sprices. This. whil* bearable for a farmer iti tdldt a historic cost rent of 3 o'r4 an acre. is verging 0 on the impossible for farmers paying Â· btes tbee or four time- these figures. The obvious answer would be to increase yields; these: have, thank to the plant breeoer and the use of sprays and fertlisers, increase- Sby 50 pt,rcet. .over the last 20 Syears and will undoubtedly go on ' rising slowly. The potential for a two-ton yield is already present in i al the varieties available to-day. : The inhibiting factor is undoub- tedly the spread of disease in the ' absence of rotational farming. l Capital Needs r d The financial advantage of cereal t growing is that the capital require - ments are small in comparison s with other systems, a medium-sized t farm could be financed with Â£25 e or even less an acre for machinery and equipment. Livestock, beside e needing more specialised care o require much more capital. To get i. a return of Â£40 an acre gross from he sheep would entail an investment in Ut four ewes costing roughly Â£40 to er Â£45 an acre. Â£40 an acre is a low is return from milking cows, they my have a much higher labour costs is and the usual stocking rate is now k a cow to about 1 acres or an il investment of Â£75 an acre. at To these financial burdens on livestock farming are added the ill physical difficulties that arise once le their numbers are increased. Four Â»(flÂ» o ll mit for what mht e easonable farm- - ing. Above that number diseases get harder and harder to keep in check as stocking rates inrease even if ample grass is grown. The effect of overstocking with sheep is that it becomes impossible to fatten the lambs off the grass, and fattening them elsewhere brings another set of resources into the arithmetic, Four ewes an acre is in fact a high stocking rate by British stan- dards, many farmers find it impos- sible to approach this figure and this relative lack of profitability in sheep is undoubtedly one of the -reasons for the drastic fall in the values of breeding sheep this year. Milk Best The best bet for a direct increase in acreage earnings is from milk, at Henley Manor, the ICl Research Farm in Somerset a herd of cows kept at over a cow to, the acre have produced sales, net of feed- ing stuffs, to the order of Â£150 an acre and a net profit estimated between Â£40 and Â£50 an acre. The . system producing these results is dependent on the intensive use of grass and nitrogen and is still admittedly experimental, but these results are already being -ap- proached by commercial dairy farmers. The increased capital needed is compensated by the much higher profit ratio. The success of this kind of dairy farming is due to the cows' apparent tolerance of an intensity of stocking that would be impos- sible with sheep. And it's a tech- nique that is bound to develop as land prices rise. The scope for an increase in milk production is almost unlimited because farmers in the future faced by stagnated grain prices may switch back to the cows they abandoned a few years ago for I what they imagined to be the care- free delights of barley growing. ' For my own part I am rearing an extra number of heifer calves so Sthat I can put in another dairy in two years time, just in case of b further trouble in the economica r of cereal growing.",

Volume, however, further de- creased 110,000 shares to 6.14m., with attendance thinned by the Jewish holiday. Congress completed action on legislation designed to halt interest rate competition between Banks and Savings and Loan Associa- tions, while market sentiment also was helped by the ease with which the Industrial Average yesterday surmounted the 800 level-an anticipated resistance zone.

THe will ask for a vote next Monday to call up the Bill, thereby ending a filibuster which has prevented dis- cussion of the legislation. Last night, the Senate voted 54 to 42 to cut off the eight-day fili- buster against the measure. How- ever, a motion for ' cloture\" of debate needs a majority of two- thirds of the senators present and yesterday's motion fell 10 votes short. ' This morning, Senator Mansfield spoke optimistically of \"a good chance of our getting more votes,\" but he conceded he \"doubted\" whether supporters of this year's Bill would be able, to. muster ,the WASHINGTON, Sept 15. necessary two-thirds majority. The Ionly alternative-one that Senator Mansfield will probably have to follow next week-would be to shelve the Bill for this year. Without doubt, the measure has come to grief in the Senate because of Title Pour of its provisions- the \"open housing section- which seeks to break up segregated housing patterns in the U.S. Un- like so much civil rights legisla- tion in recent years, this was aimed as much at northern cities as at the conservative South.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE OUTLOOK for the negotia- tions on international monetary reform has worsened perceptibly here in recent days and prepara- tions for the International Mone- tary Fund annual meeting in Washington in two weeks' time are now proceeding in an atmosphere ns bickering and depression. It is true that semor American officials maintain their usual persis- tent optimism about the prospects of securing agreement on a con- tingency plan for increasing the world's money supply. Rigid tone But many other experienced obser- vers are beginning to conclude from the latest turn of events that even the modest progress made towards agree. ment at the official level in the IMF and the Group of Ten during the past year went well beyond the political will of Governments to compromise. Two recent occurrences have con. tributed to this gloom. One is the communiqud issued by the Common Market Finance Ministers after their 'meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. The riHold tone of Pl&s -Â» P - -Â·Â·~ Â·Â·~Â·' Â·VÂ·Â·Â·r VL IUÂ·D VÂ·nUIII~II ~I(IU t- its stiff adherence to the Conservative y line on the need for liquidity, on balance of payments and on the reserves of less developed countries Shas produced a feeling in Fund circles that the French have succeeded n in dragging their partners backwards e once more. e Further evidence that these negotia- tions have a low political priority- a and not only among European countries-can be found in the wrangling that is now taking place s in the Fund Board over the draft of Sa resolution to he approved by the e Fund Governors at the meeting later this month. Logical procedure would be for the Governors to endorse formally the sugestions for the next stage of the liquidity negotiations made by the Sdeputies of the Group of Ten in their D report last month. This would entail instructing the executive directors of the Fund, by resolution, to proceed t with the task of negotiating a liquidity I agreement over the coming months . n periodic consultation with the - Group of Ten deputies. The less developed countries have i refused to endorse this resolution on r the grounds that it gives undue weight to the \"rich man's club.\" SThey wish either to delete refereice WASHINGTON, Sept. 15. to the Group of Ten altogether or to put them on a par with a number of other bodies such as the U.N. Con- ference on Trade and Development The EEC members, on the other hand, have been adamant that the resolution should recognise the unique position of the Group of Ten as the countries which must guaran- tee any new system. To make matters even worse, the EEC countries are taking the extreme line that there must be no reference in the resolution to the possibility of agreeing on a plan for the creation ot new reserves. Pettifogging The Americans have very reason ably pointed out (to no avail) that the whole object of continuing the negotiations is to reach such an agree- ment and that it would be grotesque not to recognise this publicly- particularly since the deputies of the Group of Ten have already done sc in their own report. The upshot of this pettifogging is that there will probably be no resolu. tion at all. This in itself is not particularly important, but the mood and motives behind the argument are without doubt significant and de pressing.",

   "text_content" : "- U lMMAULALA BY OnR Mi Ctwrporntdent POLLOWING the successful \"splashdown\" of Astronauts Pete Conrad and Richard Gordon in ,a Atlantic, y, est . aj.aits of Sih at'onal A'o r_ a+ uIcs and Sp-ace A.mS intntl are studying t'be redultso thlt Gemini 11 mis- sion, to determine how it may affect current hopes for a manned lunar lading early in 1968. Many aspects o the Gemini 11 mission were brilliantly successful. These included the successful Agena rendezvous; the change in orbital path to the highest that men have yet travelled from Earth-850 miles; the pin-point glimpse of the secret Russian satellite. Proton Three; the record for direct ex- posure to space by Gordon's 128- minutes stand in the open Gemini hatch, during which time he slept for a while; and the return to Barth controlled entirely by an on-board computer. Exhaustion Other aspects of the trip were not so successful, however, indicat- ing the need for more research. These included the extreme exhaus- tion felt by Gordon on his space \"walk,\" causing him to cut it short, the mysterious \"dirt\" that clogged the spacecraft's windows and the problem of perspiration misting the spacemen's visors. The causes, and the implications, of these problems will be studied and action to correct them built in- to subequient manned space flights. But they could shatter hopes of a much earlier manned lunar landing than originally planned. The original target date of put- ting men on the moon and bringin them safely back to earth by 1970 still stands officially, but so well have all the supporting pro- grammes gone till now that a tentative decision to try for a moon landing in early 1968 has been made. There is still one more launch in the Gemini series, and then the big Apollo series of manned space- flights begins, using the Saturn .family of launch vehicles, leading up to the lunar landing. The first three-man U.S. space- flight in the Saturn-Apollo series is SA-204, set for this November 15. A whole series of manned and un- manned launches will follow until, in mid-1967. SA-207 will be launched-a three-man spacecraft in the precise configuration that will be used in the ultimate lunar landing. While these flights are in pro- grass, flight-testing will be in pro- gress on the giant Saturn 5 rocket, which will be used for probably the most significant flight of all late next year. Known as SA-503, this will be a complete simulation, carried out in earth orbit, of the entire lunar mission with a three- man crew. Next week, the U.S. will resume its programme of \"scouting\" for potential landing sites on the moon with the lunch of a new Surveyor spacecraft. This will be the second of seven Surveyor missions, intended to develop the technology of soft- landing on the moon and to pro- vide scientific support for the Apollo manned landing pro- gramme. The second Surveyor, designated Surveyor B, will be launched some time in the four days from Septem- ber 20, aimed at a point in the centre of the visible face of the moon, a site photographed by the Lunar Orbiter. It will carry a TV camera, and it will obtain not only pictures but also data on the con- ditions of the lunar surface. Landing Sites Later Surveyors in the pro- gramme will map other selected landing sites, which will all be studied before a final choice of the best possible site will be made. Beyond the manned lunar land- ing, the NASA is now planning its \"Apollo Applications \" programme for deep-space activities into the 1970s, using the vast Saturn-Apollo complexes built for the Moon pro- gramme. These new ventures in- clude unmanned missions to Mars and Venus, and probes well be- yond into deep space, to the outer planets, comets and asteroids. Technclans of Hughes Aircraft Company prepare a model of the Surveyor to check its power-plant and fuel system. Surveyor 2 is scheduled to be launched around September 20.",

Under the proposal Saskatchewan joins Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta as a \"have\" Province and no longer qualifies for equalisation payments. However, because Premier Ross Thatcher of Saskatchewan pro- tested strongly about losing S35m. in payments from the Federal Treasury, Mr. Sharp has worked out a transi- tional deal that gives Saskatchewan S27m, in the first year of the agree- ment, declining each year to zero at the end of the five yos. w .

No less than Â£12,000,000 of the group's external turnover of Â£39,000,000 in that period was for overseas sales which makes it also the largest exporter of the world's highest grade cloth. In America particularly, there is a good market for the Group's top products-made internationally famous through such names as Broadhead & Graves, Crombie, Josiah France, Learoyd and Pepper, Lee. Through Joshua Hoyle & Sons, Illingworth also has a substantial stake in the Lancashire cotton industry. Illingworth's order book is very healthy, the products are unquestionably good and given more settled conditions from present uncertainties the future of the group must be bright.

(the chairman) presiding. rei The following is an extract from an his circulated review: vo We steadily increased production m in all our British factories through- out 1965 and by the end of that P year we were working to capacity. p We maintained this high output m during the first three months of th 1966 and were thus able to improve upon the results of the first half of Ia our financial year, as I had antici- pated in my interim report. For the whole year we have created g reords in production, shipments and proit. We earned a profit of 2 .036.762 subject only to taxation. 01 You will recall that in March last we paid a higher interim divi- 0 tend than previously in order to beneit' from the provisions of d Section 83 of the Finance Act 1965. f' For that reason the interim dividend a was not related to profits of the first half of the fluancial year arid the same rate of final dividend F could not be expected as was paid ast year. In the light of the cur- t rent economic circumstances in the United Kingdom and of the expressed declarations by respon- I sible employers' national repr- a sentatives in relation to Her Majesty's Government action on Prices and Incomes, your Direc- tors are presently of the opinion that it would be wrong to recom- mend a final dividend of 5% and they propose that it should be t 2%% which makes the total divi- dend for the year 22Y%---this beihs the samie tateas was paid in relation to the previous financial year. . .' have now .compiltd forty ypar in the 'sevie .'o your Com- Ban. during them fast ten of which Share dri t il.

I am proud to tell you that your most important subsidiary com- pany, the British Crane & Excava- tor Corporation Ltd. won the Queen's Award to Industry for 1966. It is one of only 115 com- panies which won the award and one of only 86 which won it for qzport achievement. Cumrt Trmina Mad Future . Proepeet, .., s Results fr the first few months of the new financial year show that we are currently shipping a greater volume and earning a marginally better profit than In thde sa8r period last year. Thi worsening state of the British qoondny in recent months, and the severity of the measres rcently adopted by the Oovernment ln Its effot to re- establish our country's credit abroad have, however, destroyed confidence and Initlativ amongst many of our customers in the home market, with a consequent diminution of our order bqoks, SUnfortunately, we canno: anticipate a sufficient increase in export business to use the manu- facturing capacity thus released in our U.K. plants. The trade recession is not confined to Britain and there is a reduction in the volume of business available in many countries. If Her Majsty's Government persists in credit restrictions, trip- pling taxation and deflationary measures to support sterling 1 fear that unemployment figures will go Sup and investment in the modern labour-saving plant which we manufacture will go down. A good basic load on our productive capacity for home market custo- mers is an essential condition of our successful exploitation of foreign markets. Should both contract simultaneously, we shall 1 Sbe obliged to reduce substantially I the high level of production in our factories. This would be dis- Sappointing after building up both Ssales and production but it would j be no more than a pause in our j progress, as we are well organised d in design, production and sales to r. take full advantage of all markets a when they recover. e We must continuously match i- increases in the costs of materials > and wages with increases in pro- ir productivity and we must always a keep ahead of our competitors in > the introduction of improved de- a signs and new products. In such 5 a policy I believe lies the hope d of survival of Britain as a great l trading nation and the sure expec- *' tation of this Group to attain yet is higher levels of prosperity and Sprofitability in the future.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Cpmupondent THE HAGUE, Sept. 15. The Dutch economy will continue to show a satifactory rate of growth between now and 1970. On average, the gron national product should rise by 4.8 per cent. per annu., production by 5.2 per cent. and productivity by3.9 per cent. pa i ..~c u j ,t ., per cent. anm prodocttvy by .>9 per cen These are the main conclusions of a medium-term forecast published by Holland's Central Planning Bureau. Like the SBureau's annual \" plans\" this five-year projection does not set largets but tries to predict, on the basis of certain assumptions, I how the ennnmu' mn\"n alramai.#. ull Aas . n In this case, the most important assumptions are: 1-That the volume of world trade will increase by 6-7 per cent. per annum. 2-That price rises at home and abroad will be set within fairly narrow limits by anti-inflationary policies. 3-That Holland will try to achieve, by 1970, a balance of pay- ments surplus on current account of FIs.l,000m. (Â£100m.), since this is considered necessary to finance development aid, other foreign in- vestments, and some rise in the Dutch reserves. 4-That the total domestic tax burden, and the corresponding level of Government spending, will either remain at the 1965 level of ots will develop. 25.9 per cent., or, alternatively, rise to 26.7 per cent. or to 27.5 per cent. S-That foreign immigration will continue, while the standard work- ing week will be shortened by somre 5 per cent., or 2% hours. 6-That the housing shortage will be over by 1970 through an increase in 'the annual building pro- gramme (of slightly better quality houses in all categories) to 125,000 units. The general consumer price level will rise by at least 3 per cent. a year, mainly as a result of rent increases, higher indirect taxation, and \"EEC effects.\" If wages, as expected, rise by 6.7 per cent. per annum-which is rather less than in the past three years and seems doubtful in view of the 1970 forecast of only just over",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE FRENCH aircraft manufac- turer Marcel Dassault publicly crossed swords with the U.S. Administration to-day over the latter's efforts to prevent the sale of three of the company's Falcon executive jets to South Africa. In an unprecedented Press com- muniqud, the company states that on May 25 last year the South African Government ordered three Falcon aircraft for the use of officials and visiting foreign dignitaries. The company then approached the US. Department of Commerce for authorisation to export the American made parts of the aircraft which in- clude the engine, electrical equipment, wheels and brakes. However in July this year permission was refused under the terms of the UN embargo on sales of military equipment to South Africa. The communiqud goes on to ques- tion the justice of this decision. stating that the 150 other orders already received for this aircraft from all over the world testify to its strictly civilian nature. It concludes PARIS, Sept. 15. by saying that negotiations with the U.S. authorities are still in progress. Dassault's statement confirms rumours to much the same effect which were reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on September 1. However, it places the blame for the sales hold up squarely on the U.S. Administration and implicitly rebuffs suggestions made at that time that the pressure had come either from the U.S. com- panies which supply parts for the Falcon or Pan American Airlines. which is a major Dassault customer. The Falcon. or Mystbre 20 execu. tive jet as it is sometimes called. carries between eight and 18 passen- gers at speeds of up to 560 mph and has a range of about 2.000 miles. It is fitted with two General Electric CF 700 turbo jets and is priced at around Sim. While no official comment was available from U.S. sources here to-day, no attempt was made either to deny the accuracy of Dassault's account of its negotiations with the American Department of Commerce. But informed observers remained highly perplexed by Dassault's motives for making such a statement when on its own admission talks were still going on with the U.S. authorities.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Norway Shipowners Favour \"Conventional\" Vessels",
   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent From Our Ow NORWAY'S shipowners feel that re. search aimed at improving ships with conventional propulsion should take priority, in Norway, over any further studies of nuclear ship propulsion. This view is expressed in a report to the Norwegian Ministry of Indus. try by Norges Rederforbund (the Norwegian Shipowners' Association). The report says there ie a \"pressing need\" for intensified efforts to im. prove construction and methods of operation and maintenance of \"con. ventional\" ships and this should be given \"clear priority\" over atomic research, Almost seven years ago, a Ministry of Industry White paper on Norway's atomic research plan said special wn Correspondent OSLO, Sept. 15. 0e attention would be given to the de. ih velopment of a reactor type suitable ;0 for ship propulsion. Since then there r has been criticism from Norwegian Sindustry that all types of atomic re. search have been taking too great a rt share of Government spending on s- scientific and industrial research. The ie Rederforbund's report is an annexe ). to a report by a committee which the is Norwegian Federation of Industry appointed to study the whole question. f Norway's Industrial and scientific I. research priorities are due to be de. e bated in the Storting (Parliament) this ic autumn, and the business-orientated coalition Government now in power y can be expected to give considerable Swelght to the commonsense views of 11 the Industriforbund on this issue, ----, 1 per ent. unemployment - the volume of private consumption could rise by 4.1 per cent. a year. This would allow private savings to recover from last year's low (14 per cent. of the net national income) to 15.5 per cent., compared with over 16 per cent. in 1955 and nearly 17 per cent. in 1960. View Reflected The projected growth can only be brought about if investment con- tinues at a high level, says the Plan- ning Bureau. While the volume of investment in fixed assets in the private sector will rise by 5.7 per cent. a year, public investment will rise by 9.6 per cent., and so become the fastest-rising spending category in the economy. The latter development, like the choice between the present high level of taxation and two even higher levels as sole alternative assumptions undoubtedly reflects the political views of the present Government, to whose Socialist Economics Minister the Planning Bureau is ultimately responsible. The need for the public investment rise is explained by the \"considerably increased infrastruc. tural demands.\" The Plan also contains an analysis of growth by industry, which shows that some industries will probably increase their annual production much faster than others: chemicals by 11.9 per cent., and electrical engineering by 8.7 per cent., while industries like food processing (3.2 per cent.), clothing and footwear (2.3 per cent.) will continue their present very modest growth. The average industrial production increase is estimated at 6.9 per cent., while agriculture will produce only 2.5 per cent. per annum more. Natural gas production should reach an annual value of FIs.l,000m. by 1970. Exports are expected to become even more concentrated on the rest of the Common Market than they are already, with chemicals a fast-growing export product, while imports of consumer goods will rise consider- ably.",

Delivery in Britain of the right hand drive models- will not start until January, when the price wil be announced. Engine capacity has been raised to 844 cc from its present 746 cc, pro- ducing 40 bhp, or 334 per cent. more power. It remains a two-cylinder four-stroke, with horizontally opposed cylinders and the increased capacity EINDHOVEN, Sept. 15. has been obtained by lengthening the stroke to 73.5 mm, the bore still being 85.5 mm. A maximum speed of 76 mph is now claimed, with brisker accelera. tion-standstill to 50 mph in 15 seconds. The new body has been designed by Michelotti in conjunction with DAS stylists, 'and has flowing lines, also the spare wheel in the nose to act as a buffer in case of collisions.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Corrpodent BONN, Sept. 15. DR. L. WESTRICK, West German Minister of State and for 15 years one of Dr. Erhard's closest advisers, tendered his resignation to-day. A statement said Dr. Westrck wished to make is easier for the Federal Chancellor to consider Government changes at a later time of his own choosing. Dr. Erhard told the Bundestag he had not yet decided whether to accept the resignation of his chief assistant, who has been under attack lately from within the Chancellor's own party. How- ever, it is understood that Westrick will go. For the time being Dr. Erhard has asked him to carry on in the job created for him. Dr. Westrick has taken care of Chancellery organisation. making use of his considerable talents for smooth. ing over differences. For some time the suspicion has gained ground that this same talent has prevented Dr. Erhard from coming to grips with important problems. Acute Problems Only yesterday Dr. Erhard told the Cabinet that he was not now think- ing of a Cabinet shuffle. Dr. West. rick's step need not give the lie to that, since his tasks could easily go to a civil servant. But to-day's statement makes it clear that Dr. Erhard may well in- tend to move once he has got the better of such acute problems as the crisis in the Bundeswehr and the need for economic reform. Dr. Erhard's proposal on the latter point-a Bill to give him greater powers to manage economic affairs- received its first reading in the Bundestag to-day. At the end of the debate, the Bll and a constitutional amendment that goes with it, were sent to the specialist committees concerned. Herr Kurt Schmuecker, Minister of Economics, promised that serious consideration would be given there to mprovements proposed by the Opposition. On the whole, the debate was sub- dued. The fur did not even fly when Herr F. J. Strauss, the former Defence Minister, went to the ros. trum. Herr Strauss has not hesitated to criticise Dr. Erhard's management of the economy but to-day he defended the Chancellor against Oppo- sition taunts. It was laughable, he said, to. pretend that Government economiqipolicy had faled.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Scientific Correspondent STOCKHOLM, Sept 15. The opening to.day, in the presence of Prince Berti of Sweden, of International Business Machines' Nordic Laboratory, seventh major research centre to be set up in Europe, marks the beginning of an intensive diive by the company on the process control markets I in the Western hemisphere countries. This includes Britain, where sales of automation equipment p to 1970 are estimated at Â£25m. in a market contested by eight f r s sÂ· v I, c r a i r s 1 Y :Â· makers. Process control has been one of the slowest areas of computer application to develop and IBM has not so far deployed anything like as much effort in this field as in business equipment. Take-off Point Now, however, the world market is at the take-off point, the com- pany believes, since last year 600 process control systems were sold while total installations still num- ber only 1,000 worldwide. A 50 per cent. actual growth rate is fore- cast in sales for the next several years to meet manufacturing indus- try's need to double its produc- tivity between now and 1980. The new laboratory with its 150-strong staff of scientists, engineers and electronic technicians will be workilg eItirely on the problems of , capturing information from industrial processes, routine laboratory opera- ions and delicate but complex pieces of research, and turning this informa- tion into a form suitable for processing by computer. The decision to entrust the important task of conceiving and, building these new extensions td coputer capability solely .to the, Nordic Laboratory marks a radical change in'IBM policy. * Hitherto the company has allowed quite a large number of computing 4 projects to go ahead up to the proto- type stage in its various laboratories on the basis that this competition was i. io a maracMi uueswC oy Ue@1u a stimulus to development. But this is now considered too wasteful of skilled engineering effort and will no longer occur, releasin a large propor- tion of staff in the organisatio's 37 world-wide research and development laboratories for new work. The .Nordic laboratory has already developed an' information-capturing system, the 1080, aimed at the uicly growing medical research and labora- tory market.- This machine can take signals from a vast range of labors. tor eq ent and turn them into a full description of a edial test or an experiment, recorded .either on paper tape or on punched cards. Immense Saving It can tackle 100 tests at a time and offers an immense saving on labora- tory technicians' paper work now eti- working time. The ordic organisation ws also involved 'in Ihes development of a somewhat similar system but one aimed at industry, known as the 1070. This unit can be used to operatea whole, remotly-tutely d projct :.by signals transmitted over ordinary telephone lines. Another major task imposed od the Nordic laboratory is to prepare a translator which will turn instructions in the scientific computer language most used in Europe-Algol--mnto the form In which they can be obeyed by System 360 computers. This task, begun in Germany two years ago, will take until the autumn of next year to complete.",

Patoriag, for ong a wellknown phenomenon in America, is only six years old n this country. The term can be used in various ways, but those who describe thmsnelves as factors are quite clear a to what they do. Esentially factor buys the debts of a client company, and so takes over the ledger. this is in contrast to invoice discount- ing, which is rather on an ad hoe bass. The fators offer three pedfic services which they stres no other orgnsia-l tion can offer in a package: the client gains entire crdit-prote- tion; a service of credit controQ account collection and salds book-keeping; and finance, by realising as cash what otherwise would be lying in the balance- sheet as amounts due. Factor- ing accordingly can bring greater efficiency either in a -financial sense, by making the best possible use of assets, or administratively by farming out an area of activity, so that a company can concentrate on production and sales. In addi- tion the company ains what is in effect a full insurance licy. Factoring can serve th domestic and exporting firms: the growth at the moment is greater in the former field, but the method may have par- ticular advantages in exporting, especially when a smalllsh firm is dealing in a number of markets with which it is unfamiliar. Some Reticence It is very difficult to measure the extent of this new business, as few firms publicise their use of a factor; the explanation here seems to be partly com- mercial reticence, but there is also still a prejudice that there must be something wrong with a firm's liquidity if it uses a factor-as opposed to the view the factors themselves advance, that there must be something right with it Factors are now working in the fields of textiles, food, toys, light and heavy engi- neering, timber, footwear, ad- vertising, and others. Most of their clients are neither substan- tial nor well known, but many are developing, rapidly; .several firms with turnovers of Â£3m. and Â£4m, now factor their sales. It is of course an advantage to tIe factors themselves to hav a wide spread, to iron out -1 cyclical tinds within the indus- tries of their clients. International Factor with a. turnover above Â£25m. considers it may have 40 per cent. of the U.K. market, while Portland Group Factors claims it is prob. ably he bigtest in Europe; to. gether they have about 70 per Scent. of the market. There are a number of others-H and H, Shield, Mercantile.,Alex Lawrie, Allied, among them-but as few I figures are published it is diffi- Scult to gain an idea of scale. However, talk of a trade in this .country in hundreds of millions is very misplaced. S Possible Dangers Boom conditions have not been the case for all. Inter- Snational Factors' unfortunate . ,experiences in factoring for. the diamond industry is one indica- t ion of the possible dangers of expecting -American , develop ments to be repeated quickly. Another is, the fact, that S . Gerber for some three years ran a factoring company which is now closing down. GOrbers found. people fought shy of the new factoring idea. but it also a tended not to take over the whole book, and so was not r really a fully fledged factor. t Significantly, though it con- siders factoring has a strong Sfuture, Gerbers prefers not to Sput money in it at the moment. e The factors, too, have a Smarket which has certain limits Salmost by definition; Large it companies can afford adequate ,credit control on a computerised basis, can stand risks, and have access to prime rate money. The factors are looking really f for those in the \"Macmillan Sgap\" with turnovers anywhere between Â£100,000 and LÂ£m. or Â£2m. Within such confines, of course, there is plenty to go for. Shield Factors thinks probably under 5 per cent. of this market e is now factorised.\" SSound Footing s Expressions of confidence are certainly widespread, Inter- h national Factors, which despite a losses has grown phenomenally, v says business is now on a very Ssound footing and is expecting g \"comfortable\" profits next w year: Portland Group Factors Sremarks that it has never less i. than doubled, its size in 12 I- months: Shield, stressing that f growth has been deliberately i- controlled in view of the y novelty of the field, sees expan- il sion now at .about 20 per cent. i. per annum. Most factors seem i. to think they can ride out the o credit squee quite happily. 0 Ironically, in th eonditions -they nsoe mne aqr but they ca do little about What, however of th. it's point of view? They must be of a certain sie. Some factor . will handle a turnover of Â£50,000 p.a., but most find less than Â£100,000 p.a. uneconomi- cal. The charges to clients ar of two sorts. They must pay the service charge on the accounting which the factor provides, individually tailored but ranging from %% to 2%%. They may also draw on the debts they have assigned to the factor, usually up to 80% of the total, for which they now generally pay 2% above Bank Rate. On occasions this can be an extremely useful source of money, but it is costly. The factors, however, offera flexible t service, as the client decides Swhether he wishes to draw the Smoney, and the extent of doing so, while the amount available Sto the client is the direct result Sos his own performance in Sselling. S Closely Involved The client, by handing over his credit ledger, is tying him- self closely to the factor. It might be thought that the t administrative changes in the client's business which will result would create a structural weakness, and certainly in time factor and client become closely involved. This need not be dis. advantageous. Moreover, the S factors say they rarely lose an a account, while there may now Sbe enough of them to provide Ssome real competition. The in- efficiency of book-keeping in s smaller companies is sometimes considerable, and with their size I and notably with computers I factors can bring real savings. S The factors clearly vary Sconsiderably in what they offer as services and how they set Sabout them. Some stress the t financial angle, others the accounting advantage and hope to. remain with their clients, providing an administrative service, when these have achieved access to prime rate B money. But not all industries Sare suitable for factoring, and a the method is certainly no ,panacea for all financial failings. v The Americans have pioneered g essential financial methods, like t hire purchase, which in this s country have not always been Sreadily accepted. Equipment Z leasing, too, has been slow-to t develop. In the United States v now a large percentage of com- a panies factor their sales, with - a turnover of more than . SS.00m., but there is a long Shistory behind this development. P At the least here, factoring has . a clear niche to work in. and s an interesting future before it.",

Par- liamentarians have complained of 'he drain of local talent and foreign exchange, and called for tight screening of applications for foreign participation. A similar review was undertaken during late Prime Minister Mr. hastra's time. This led to tighten- ing up of rules of licencing of joint ventures. The Government's present policy s to turn down all proposals for foreign technical or financial participation in non- priority industries. Even in- the case of priority industries, no pro- posal is approved unless the entre- preneurs undertake to complete acquisition of know-how before the expiry of a three-yea period.

No conference resolution was issued at the end of the three-day meeting but most delegates agreed that close co-operation between national development banks and the regional Asian Development Bank will be an absolute necessity. It was suggested by some dele- gates that the Conference of Development Banks in Asia should become a function of the Asian Bank. No decision was reached on when and where the next con- ference will be held. It was generally admitted by delegates to the 15-nation meeting that it is most important for recipient countries and their development banks to follow solid economic and business policies if additional loans and investments TOKYO, Sept. 15. from industrial nations are to be expected. Many representatives com :ented during interviews at the close of the session that Asian nations must continue cultivating close relations with international financial organisatons and that co-operation will become more im- perative in the future. To-morrow, it was learned, at ast a third of the delegates are expected to visit Japanese Govern- ment offices to determine pos- sibility of increased financial aid for their individual countries.

Agitation against the Throne The Union Nationale des Forces Populaire (UNFP), the party to which Ben Barka belonged, was accused by the King of repub- licanism, and subsequently decided to go underground. The party started agitation against the throne, in conjunction with the Commun. ists and certain sections of the powerful labour movement, dis- tributed inflammatory pamphlets, and called for demonstrations. They had always called in doubt the validity of the constitution voted for in the national referen dum of 1962 and hoped that in a new scheme of things their power would be enhanced. The major Istiqlal or Independ- ence Party, which led the struggle for indelendence over 40 years ago, protested openly against the King's action and is still leading the public opposition to him. King Hassan cannot afford to arrest its leaders, as he did those of the UNEP. Istiqlal's leader, Allal Alfasi, was a close friend of his father and stands for monarchy as the form of government most suitable for Morocco. Furthermore, Alfasi's following in the country is great Some observers feel that King Hassan has made a mistake in not drawing Alfasl and the leadership of the Istiqlai closer to him. Apparently, Alfasi did attempt in the early days to give the King advice, which was reected. Instead the Istiqlal members com- plain, he only listens to his own restricted group of friends-or \"Yes men. At least one in- fluential member of the party has intimated to your correspondent that in such a ituation, he and his colleagues may be forced to jo Sundergmo and join forces with the UNFP. Aware of this danger, the King has turned to the Army for the bulk of his support. Thus, he !77M! IMMENSIRIMMU King Hassan i prefers to undergo diplomatic -trains with France and a suspen- sion of aid rather than sacrifice General Oufkir. the Minister of the interior, and most influential oficer in the Army, to the imperious demands of the old mother cour try. In fact, it could be said that the scandal being publicly aired in Paris at the moment is the least of King Hassan's worries. In the long run, however, th. Moroccan Army can hardly be a substitute for some form of demo. cratic government. Nor will it necessarily be a more reliable prop to the regime than armies elsewhere in the Middle East have been. The Army-as well as the King himself -is already growing restive about the build-up in arms in Algeria which has already created a strong and marked disparity in the two countries' strengths. France no longer supplies the Moroccan Army, and King Hassan is not likely to get any joy on this scow when he visits Moscow. The unems5 within the Army could, coanclv ably, provide a coup flash-point.l: Meanwhile, despite Morocco'a potential, economic life stagnatae Unemployment, exacerbated by lut winter's drought, continues to risefc even among the educated. Witt French aid and assistance witW drawn since the start of the Blea Barka scandal, many projects are at a standstill. Long-term planning is suffering where ministers are merely civil servants liable to dis missal by the King. At the same time French control of a large part of the economy, including agrcul. ture. remains a source of friction. Little Support Abroad Abroad, King Hassan can look for little support. On his eastern border the revolutionary Algerian regime is still smarting from the defeat sustained at the hands of Morocco two years ago, and plays host to some of the King's most hostile compatriots. Tunisia is dis- satisfied with Morocco's neutral stand in the conflict between Presi- dent Bourguiba and President Nasser, and, on the other hand, is the only Arab country to have re- cognised Mauretania to which Morocco lays claim. Diplomatic relations with Syria have been broken off over Damascus Radio and Press attacks on King Hassan. Relations with the UAR are nor- mal on the surface (and on Morocco's part conciliatory), but President Nasser will never forsake his plans against \"the reactionary regime\" in Rabat or withdraw his support for Algeria. All in all, King Hassan, who last, year complained of his Parlia- ment's \" futile debating\" should be pondering whether the convenience of absolutism is not outweighed by the factious opposition that it arouses. At least, some kind of representative Government would share the responsibility for econo- mic ills that now falls heavily on him.

In spite of these excellent fUis. savs Mr. Hellmuth. ie positive seling effort made by British com- panies \"could be improved con- siderably.\" All but two of the categories selected for \"Market Germany\" are consumer goods. but Mr. Hell- muth adds a reminder that 75 per cent. of Britain's exports consist of capital goods (if motor vehicles are el cruded) .dÂ«n there is stwil much we could do to increase.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondet S NEW YORK. Sept. 15. FOR ALL the furore that followed a sales mission to New York last year from Leicester and County Chamber of Commerce, the chamber is to send another group of industrialists to visit American cities next month. This time the mission will visit cities in the South and West. though after it ends four of'its members plan to spend some time in New York. Whereas last year's mission drew its members from both industrial equipment and knitwear manufacturers, the present one will be a more cohesive group with all its members drawn from the textile industry and most of them' representing knitwear and hosiery manufacturers. 1965 visit After the visit to New York in 1965,. Leicester Chamber com- plained bitterly about the failure of the British Government officials here to introduce members of the mission to suitable sales contacts, the furore reached its climax in a debate in the House of Commons. To guard against a similar crisis this autumn, the Chamber's secre* tary, H. Leslie Milliard, who will lead the mission in October, came out to the U.S. last May for a reconnaissance trip to 'cities to be visited. All bad feeling meanwhile seems to have been laid aside and the U.K. Government officials in the U.S. are co-operating closely with the Chamber in arranging a schedule for the industrialists. Between October 10 and 29 the mission will visit Los Angeles. Houston, Dallas, New Orleans and Atlanta. Members will seek both to make direci sales and to examine market prospects in various cities. The mission will have nine mem- bers including Mr. Milliard. Lien drive In a separate export drive a party of about 10 linen merchants from Northern. Ireland will assemble in New York on October 3 prior to setting out individually on con- centrated sales drives which will take them to most parts of the US. and Canada over the follow- in forthight; Most of the members of the Irish linen mission, which will be led by W. Brice Smyth of William Ewart and Son. are seasoned exporters and are reular visitors to the U.S. They will be selling a wide variety of linen piece and made up goods. In 1965' the U.S. took roughly 60 per cent. or S23m. of these goods which were exported from Northern Ireland.",

This is one of the tenets under the association's reorganisation discussed at a meeting in London yesterday. The meeting agreed to amend the association's constitution, electing for the first time a court of presl- dent and five vice-presidents, and to elect on a new basis a council for the ensuing year. A council of 15 was elected to represent more equally the main activities. Consultations The association was formed in 1940 to be the point of contact be- tween the Government and the specialist export houses. Since then BEHA's activities have been largely confined to consultations with various Government departments on matters affecting the export trade. It has also dealt with putting manufacturers in contact with ap- propriate export houses. However. the reorganisation has come about because of BEHA's desire to take mpre initiative in putting forward the views and poli- cies of the specialist companies in the export trade. To this end it has already'extended its activities to in- clude for the first time the export finance houses. Lord AldigrSto The following were- lected to the Court: Lord Aldington, presi- dent; Sir John Burns (Glasgow), Sir Charles Denman, Mr. Hilary Eccles-Williams (Birmingham), Sir Geoffrey Gibbs and Lord Kilmar- nock, vice-presidents. The council includes:. The Hon. R. D. Campbell (Balfour Williamson Export Services); hair- man; Mr, Peter Adam (Adam and Harvey), fortmercbants and'export managers; Mr. J. W. G.

The submarine has al its energy supplied by the pressurised-water reactor - for lighting, propulsion, esalination (for freshwater needed For drinking and bathing) and air- conditioning. Thus a completely self. 1upporting system is made possible. H S i Resolution Is all-British :xcept for the Polaris missiles and assoclated weaponry gear.

The opening of the Wiggins Teape Â£15m. pulp mills to-day was hailed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. William Ross as a milestore for Britain- with a warning of the tremendous allied problems involved. The urban population of the Fort William area would double in about 15 year, the Minister declared, and the local authority and .the Regional. ospital board had to face the problems of pro- viding services to meet the growth. \"I am sure we can conquer these problems. This is a point of return for the Highlands. This is not just Port William's job but Scotland's job, and in relation to the essential problems of the country the U.K.'s job,\" added 'Mr. -Ross. Profssor R.

There was every prospect that those develop. ments would be even greater than the paper mills, Formally openin the mills, the president of the Wfagins Telne Group, Mr. L. W. Farrow, said the Hihlands for too lon had been the ob t of lament. But in their triumph they should still look ahead, and the success of these mills end rowing prosperity of the region could be acheved only by urther eorts and a dedicaton to fierce eficiency. .

Shipyard union leaders today rejected the Geddes Committee's proposal that the number of unions in shipbuilding and ship re pairing should be reduced from 5 to five. The executive of the Confedera- tion of Shipbuilding and.Engineer- ng Unions, meeting here, decided that this idea was impracticable because most of the unions have more members employed outside the shipyards than are in the ship- building Industry. . Alternatives But as an alternativi to union amalgamations, the Confederation is to set up a special committee to conduct negotiations with the Shipbuilding Employers' TFedera- tion. Although this is a modest-alterna. tive to the far-reaching proposal of the Geddes Committee, it will be welcomed by the employers (who will be told about it at a meeing between the wo sides next Wednesday). It/will stop the inter-union jealousy that was caused by the make-up of the Confederation's old negotiating committee for the shipbuilding indus- try. Under the old system, every union was entitled to send a rep. resentative to negotiations with the employers. This meant that the major shipyard union, the Boilermakers' Amalgamation, had the same voting power as the smallest union irr the industry.",

In \"The Promenade\" the tpa has a ttee-iuned Bond Street WhiAh helpi its reputation as one of the oost fashionable shopping centres of the west- even if the High Street which crosses it at its nofthern end has the same chain stores and super- markets' neon signs and mid- century mosaic as Oluouester. In fact, Cheltenham suffers to some extent from a split person. ality. The Refgncy image is carefully cultivated, and its popu- lation probably still includes an above-averag prortion of formet Bmpire-buldrs and army widows. Bdt the young people now stay in the town, rather than drifting away: in- dustry has arrived, and with it good employment prospects. Prized Captures As with the county town, the influx has been largely of techno- logicil engineerin ':concerns, although Cheltnham i'1 rather pleau d with itse= fr, having captured the decentralised por- tion o theFiotieig OQfce and the admiaistrative ~e~quarters and computer centre of Eagle Star Insurance. Cheltenham also has a, good housing record-over 5,000 built since the war, including 1,000 for incoming civil servats--and educationally it can boast three public schools, a couple of grammar schools, two teachers' trkining colleges, and art and technical colleges. The one thorn in Cheltenham's side is its administrative status. Three times it has been recom- mended for county borough status, and three times it has been foiled by a change of Gov- ernment. Until it gets this accolade (assuming it ever does) it will continue to subsidise the rural area* of the county from its rate fund. However, this problem may well be eliminated, one way or another, by the out. come of the Royal Commission on Local Government. GLOUCESTER AND CHELTENHAW-(Contd.) HIGH EMPLOYMENT IN LOCAL INDUSTRY When the first evidens materialised last month that the \"iqueeze\" was beginning to .bite, Gloucester found itself In the headlines in an unaccustome. role. Two hundred, of the 1,000 workers declared redundant at three plants by the Fibres Divl slon of Imperial Chemical Indus tries were on the payroll of the Division's Oloucester works. Immediately before the an. nouncement, the city's unea.e ployment rate had been only 0,9 pe. ent.. and there had in ay. 52 on the Mnlstry of Labur's books looking for work. II the labour pool wa temporarily swelled by the ICI announcement, however, any surplus .seemed likely to be mopped up.quickly: there were immediate Inquiries from other local employer anxious for extra hands. A shortage of labour has been a chrotle problem in Oloucester over the last few year, In Chei. tonham the situation hau been even worse: August's unemploy. ment rate waÂ» 0.14 or Cen.

Among World-famous engineer. ing names centred on Gloucester are Fielding and Platt, the hydraulic specialists, Winget Gloucester and Oloster Saro. But the city is also the base for several companies tied to the timber Industry. 'Prominent among these are 8. J.

British Midland Airways runs scheduled services to the Channel Islands from the airport, andthere is an expand- ing charter business. Eight local busites organisations have air- craft, perating from Staverton. A recent scoop was the accep- tance of Staverton as a satellite to Oxford for the training of BEA and BOAC pilots.

With the introduction of such a control system all the fears of loss of substance (loss of purchasing value) of the Â£ on the side of foreign creditors would be immediately elimid- ated. No further aid would then be needed for supporting, from month to month, the Â£, Gradal Looseing From the precise moment when the Control system is in full operation, the ctedil squeete for industry (and here again, chiefly for the exporting industries) could be gradually loosened by (a) progressively reducing the rates ofinterest on bank credits, bank advance, bank loans, etc., to exporting industries and also, of course (b) gradually increasing the volume of such credits and loans, also by floating middle- term or long-term loans for financing, if needed, certain particular major industrial pro- jects in overseas countries (such as delivery of complete sac- tories, hydro-electiic power plants, oil pipeline systems with pumping and boosting statiods). .:lIt. wold', then als be pos- sible to place at the disposaLo* the inddstris- :workint mailady for 'export greaterwamvoonts of' bank loans at fepasonable rat of interest for carrying througlh 0(a) modesaton ratona tion;,.uto atlion, 0t,f eoift. n plat and equipent, Senlargement of' Exstusg produc' tive capacities and maybp al (c) intensalication of ~pffdrts . .the feldt ps d ard a devel .opment.., , -. . .* ... ,:-. :4 Even it, in the course of time lay-offs and dismissals of workers in certfa partiular branceics of industry (paticu- larly in those working for the consumer market, and market- ing their koods by hitp-Ourcbhse or credit cards) shoul our it would thea bo ome much asier than otherwise to provide for a relatively speedy r-employment of dismissed workers, by promptly re-inforcin the work- sin troops in the factories chiefly or perhaps almost ex- clusively woiking for export. The phastly spectre of a reces- sion ould thus be banned most effectively, and, as a result, the trade, unions would be more likely than otherwise to don- tinue giving their kind support to the Government. Imports (especially of so- called \" nonessentials \") could then be iradually reduced and held within teasonable limits also inl an indirect way, that is, without establishing any kind of a quota system (with \" re- ference periods,\" etc.). and without increasing . customs dqtiÂ«,- by s yimlyI 61s0ib 8i OW obilation y I orttrtto open ievoeable and oflitod credits in favootrof mtia kuctaeC agaidsii B'y- ment hlib ' bs bp ta S& ar f d the wue.of the torr dly o imord rt in Â«, o i my p tanioa\" fabrly tfllc|nL bj'tM for' Import- n 6 imports of non-Fresntia\"lb particular.

BATH COUNCIL RAISES RENTS Bath housing committee has decided to raise the rent of 6,000 council house tenants despite a letter from the Housing Minister, Mr. Anthony Greenwood, which said the rents must not be raised. Increyses of up to 10s a week were approved by the. Bath City Council in July. The housing com- mittee chairman, Alderman Sidney Smith said yesterday: ' It is felt that if the rents are not increased now, it will only mean a larger rise later with the ratepayer bearing the immediate burden.\" LEICESTER PLAN TO PEG RATES NEXT YEAR From Our Own Correspondent LEICESTER, Sept, 15.

This is the obvious.danger tna the greater the extent to whic. the mirror technique is develope to prevent liquidity stresses gettir out of hand, the leWs pressure then will be on the advanced countrie to tackle the root of the problen --which is, of course, the need so a massive enlargement of the re serves that can be owned rathe than just borrowed. Loss of face The new arrangements the U.S Federal Reserve has made with 1 of the foreign central banks participating in its swap credi system will effectively raise the total of American foreign exchange resources by some $1,700m. This will be reflected-the swap credi system being operated on the mirror principle-in an equivalen enlargement of the reserves of the other countries concerned. So the overall effect has been to add a one stroke S3,400m. to the world's foreign currency reserves. Since the new credits the U.K. ba simultaneonsly fixed up with central banks in other tansactiona will add another several hundred million dollars to this figure, the International liquidity stock can now be said to stand very nearly 10 per cent higher than it did a week ago. The central banking community must have been painfully aware hat such a development-coming bard on the heels of the recent nnouncement that another round of liquidity discussions by its ex- perts had revealed no urgent need for action-would be calculated to eave it looking more than a little illy. So an attempt has naturally been made to pass off the reinforce. ment operation as merely a pre- cautionary measure to guard against any eventuality rather than one that was in any sense called or at this point of time. \" It seemed appropiate,* the Bank of England statement explained,\" that international swar operations should be increased sq s to provide a broad mariln of afety more than sufficient to cover any foreseeable contingencies.\" The American announcement, tressin' that \"the broada\"pqi of th credit lines should be seen ;1 _ against a background of market uncertainty,\" was a variation on hbe same theme. The truth of the matter is, of course, that a new elaboration of international arrangements for containing liquidity stresses had been rendered a mord or less urgent necessity by the serious threat to the world's monetary peace posed by the onset of a major international interest rates war-this just at a time when its financial structure was already be. ing placed under considerable strain by the payments difficulties of the reserve currency countries and their efforts to,resolve them. The much-vaunted interhational financial collaboration system having completely failed to take action to prevent-the interest rates war assuming such dangerous pro- portions, it clearly could not afford to stand idly by while the fighting took its tolL It therefore became evident that prompt action by the central banks to reinforce the international reserves structure at its most vulnerable points was imperative, no matter what this might cost them in terms of loss of face. The world financial situation does, of course, look somewhat abnormal at present. But the very fact that it has been necessary to shore up the international liquidity structure at the first sign of trouble is a tacit admission that it is basic- ally weak. There is, after all, no reason for thinking that. such abnormal conditions will never re- turn. Indeed. with so many more countries making extensive use of interest rates manipulation in domestic economic management and to protect their attenuated re- serves against external payments stresses of all kinds, such condi- tions could easily become the rule rather than the eckeption. The disadvantage In short, the idea that there i at present no insufficiency of inter national reserves ba's .bdtn comr pletely exploded. And-\"that itself is naturally all to the- good. The big disadvantate o'ffhis piecemeal treatment of the wetakaiss of the present:systetn is, alis said at the start, that it must tend to dncourags an approach to liqutdity- reform that relies primarily on the defi ciency of teserves beii made good through the creation ftemporary racilitC. or i if Ibecoming more and mnore evident that ht closing of thf reserves gap by sagh means can beb mort thaan : Vy poor su-bsitate. for '.a, formoo-f the system which aifs ti strenthenien the relationship between the re- serves countries can actually own .id their need for international liquidity. \"_*: , . ' _. . ... .,_. It is not only that the prolifera- tion of swap credit facilities does ': nothing to ease the shortage of:' the form of international liquidity of which the world stands most in Deed-gold. And the fact that one of the important secondary pur- poMs of this week's big new exercise is to reduce the danger of the U.S. gold stock being exposed to a new drain provides a further indication of how acute this liquidity shortage-within.a- shortage has become. It is also the case that there is still a widespread tendency to re- gard secondary reserves as being of far less value than owned ones in calculating, how safe a country's currency is. It is a fact that right through the mammoth sterling crisis of the past two years Britain's reserves have been found, when foreign credit lines are taken into account, far beyond normal levels. But this has not prevented anxieties about the state of the pound's defences contributing powerfully to doubts about the countrv's ability to resist devaluation. The endency has been for the outside world to see such special assistance as wholly temporary or as con- stituting a charge on owned reserves. Last but by no means least, though many of the swap credits arranged since this phenomenon irst made its appearance on the world stage in the early 1960's have >roved enduring, such facilities can e withdrawn at short notice or renewed only on conditions that the recipient may find extremely unpalatable. As a stop-gap in other words, the stronger the emphasis on this method of making good the liquidity shortage, the greater the degree to which coun- tries will be subject to interference by others in shaping their economic policies. And while such \"assist- nce \" may up to a point be help- ul, it would be most unsatisfactory to allow conditions to be created wherein large numbers of coun- tries could hardly move hand or oot without obtaining foreign approval It is important, therefore, that the emergency reinforcement of he liquidity structure that has emerged from the events of the past few days should not be regarded as a further step towards an international liquidity reform elying in the main on the enlarge- nent of the supply of conditional reserves. It should be seen only as a stop-gap aimed 'at providing the world with a breathing space while it evolves a realistic plan for achieving the overall enlarge- ment of owned resources' that has now been shown to be urgently needed,",

   "text_content" : "DR. ERHARD, the architect of c the German miracle, has lost a t good deal of his old popularity t since the miracle ran into a trouble. To get the balance of s payments right, it has been e necessary to squeeze credit hard, s and the squeeze has had a sharp t impact both on company profits I and on plans for new industrial t investment At the same time, r however, public sector expendi- i ture has continued to expand i and the rapid growth of incomes I has pushed up prices to an ex- t tent which, though moderate by our own standards, has caused a t good deal of alarm in Germany. The Chancellor himself has added to the general feeling of uncertainty by continual refer- ences to the need for wider powers and tougher measures if the economy is to be regulated without recourse to controls on incomes and the movement of 1 capital. His object, no doubt, has been to prepare the way for the controversial stabilisation Bill which was introduced into the Bundestag this week. Public spending The Bill is designed to give the Federal Government a number of powers, of a sort that are common enough in other countries, to manage the German economy. In,the first place, it would enable the Government to exercise much greater control over public expenditure. Under the post- war constitution, the provincial governments are financially independent of the Federal Government-they take 61 per cent. of the revenue from income and corporation tax- and are responsible for the lion's share of internal public spend- ing. The Bill proposes that both Federal and provincial Govern- ments should in future work to long-term plans, which would be adjusted regularly to take account of the economic situa- tion, and that the former should be able to assume temporary powers to restrict the access of all public sector borrowers to the capital market. This is a highly controversial proposal and one, since it means a change in the constitution, that can only be passed by a two-thirds majority. The other proposals put. forward in the Bill are all intended to lessen the depend. ence of the German authorities As on monetary policy to counter a the business cycle. The Federal ty budget would be used dellber- to ately as an economic weapon! of surpluses collected at times of mn excess demand being paid into a d, special fund for use at other rp times. The Government would ts have power to suspend\" from al time to time the spec itl inm st- le. ment allowances enjoyed by li- industry. The Central Bank id would be able for limited es periods to set a ceiling on x- the permitted level of bank >y advances. And so on. None of a these suggestions will seem y. particularly novel to anyone as familiar with the idea of active of Government intervention in the r. management of the economy, r but they all have their critics. if German businessmen, for ex- ed ample, do not particularly like )n the idea of having their deprecia- of tion allowances moved up and as down. and bankers are afraid he that a limit on their own ill freedom to lend will only benefit he their financial rivals. Political forces Dr. Erhard, however, insists that each of his proposals is e necessary, and it is of some at personal importance to him r that.the Bill should be passed in e its entirety. He has been under s strong attack by his own party ie recently, not only because of the ch economic situation but because lic of the defence row, the loss of tic a key provincial election, and t-some indiscreet remarks about ' the future of Europe. His ly reputation and his political Al future are tied up with the er success of the stabilisation Bill, m and that in turn, since it can , only be passed by a two-thirds s majority, depends on the attitude d- of the Social Democratic S opposition. S They are so far playing the to situation very carefully. They be would like to throw the Bill out, ke n6 doubt, bht are naturally a- reluctant to oppose mea1grci ld which are aimed against the 3y inflation that everyone in of Germany fears. They have to made vague suggestions, there a fore, that they would be willing Ial to co-operate in exchange for ge concessions that would' give the an Bill a more leftish flavour, The 'ds unfortunate Chancellor knows that whether the Bill is rejected hut. or passed only with the help of all sizeable concessionq to the id.

   "text_content" : "51 a rt- Id m ne ie x- ke a- id id mn fit is niy VlTWR or aot the seW S yiv mployment Tax ohieves its object of transferring labour from the service to the mtanufacturing industries remains to be sen. But one thing is already certain: in conjunction with the Govern. ment's other new taxes it will lead to a further substantial In-' crease in the numbers employed by the Civil Service, itself the largest single. employer in the service industries. About 1,000 men and women scattered over the;minlstries of Labour, Social Sqcrilty, a~d Agrictilture will be neededto deal with the SET. and they will be in addition to the 2,000 who are being recruited by the Inland Revenue to handle the extra work resultinfrom the corporation sand capital gains taxes. Nearing Record Already at the beginning of the current financial year the Civil Service was larger than at any time since 1950, with 430,274 members, excluding artisans, cleaners and the like, and at the present rate of expansion it will not be long before it reaches the post-war record of 460,000 estab- lished in 1947. After the Conservatives returned to office in 1951 and began to dismantle all the machinery of rationing and controls the number dropped steadily until 1959 when it reached a low of 377,000. Since then it has increased each year. In fact until the last few months t war s W very little to choose letwen the records of the two pis in this respect. Between Janry. 1960, and January, l^P e- W exakison was 6* per .381.000 to 406,000, a ietreer that date and last A A6 per cent The ainreasnsu for this had Sot t\"dowi'th politics. The qost iportant was quite simply the.nnual rise in the population. Ovei; -the- last six years the Snum wn tof people living in Britain has gone up by more than- 2mm. tb just over 55m., while the working population has risen from 14.5m. to over 25.Sm. With the plethora of forms that now cover every aspect; of our lives these increases have brought more work to practi- cally every Ministry. Moreover, almost all can produce argu- ments to show how they have been specially affected. The In- land Revenue, for example, points out that higher wages mean that more people are now paying income-tax than used to be the case, while the Depart- ment of Education and Science Shas had to cope with the expan- sion of the universities. The second factor has been the increasing complexity of the Swork of many departments. Once i again the Inland Revenue has had special problems with the I two capital gains taxes intro- [ duced by Mr. Selwyn Lloyd and Sthe present administration, which I have led to a sharp increase in Sits demand for valuers. The SBoard of Trade has had to grapple with the effects of suc- cessive governments' interest in the location of industry, while the ministries of Aviation and Defence have been confronted with contracts which become more intricate with every year that passes. Hours Cut The third major reason for the growth of numbers was the cut in civil servants' hours following the pay award of July, 1964. Precise figures on this point are difficult to find, but the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Niall MacDermot, recently esti- mated that this had led to an increase of 1,650 at the Inland Revenue alone. For all these reasons the numbers employed by the Civil Service would have dgone htt in the 'last twod years .aittever \"'hasuret .theGoven t had doubt that the stresari a Wmite Papers, new taxes and depart- mental reorganisations intro- duced since October, 1964, are now resulting in a sharper in crease than would otherwise have been the case. Since it came to power Labour has established the Department of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Tech- nology, the Ministry of Overseas SDevelopment, and the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, -although this is shortly to be m abolished. It has also merged the SMinistry of Pensions and the National Assistance Board into Sthe Ministry of Social Security, i set up two important new F 10 Id re Id ir P!- agencies In the Prices and In. diff comes Board and the Land mei Commission, and reshuffed a ban number of responsibilities. The dep Board of Trade, for Instance, has con gained shipping and marine on safety from the Ministry of is n Transport, but lost the com- Boa mercial attaches to the Foreign cies Office. and engineering to exc Technology. pro The effects of all this are im- and possible to unravel. In some to cases the new ministries have Loa been able to take over whole I offices full of civil servants in almost intact, as when Tech- Ser nology took over the DSIR and rev the DA .incorporated a number ced of Treasury departments. But it I the net result has been an in* not crease in the demand for civil wei servants of all grades. The DEA wa had to look outside for its it clerical staff, and was fortunate cm enough to find a sausage factory ten closing down, many of whose ag, staff were happy to enter government service, while all ca departments needed more princi. . pals and other senior ranks. u S. an Demands Not Met tra r do Despite the growth in its vi : numbers the Civil Service has o . been unable to meet all the o1 a demands placed upon it. Precise T, f figures on how far below 9 i, strength it is are impossible to C, a find. As one Ministry put it: a \"We know we are under q* e strength, but until We get more a a people we won't know by howat r, much. It is just a matter of i V getting the available people to ut do the work that has to bedi done.\" No department likes to admit that it is falling down on the job, and it is usually only when another official agency publicises the fact that it becomes known. Tois happened last week whens the Committee of Public ci Accounts reported that the ol Ministry of Aviation's failure to es keep antadequate check on cost plus expenditures inits ontracts in derived from the \"staff shortage si and pressure of other work\" b, since it has 100 too few technical tv cost offcers, From now on similar situations are likely to b arise in other Ministries. h a1 Falling Short ti een best to take over whi. tiole is fultCl of civil servants i whose annual report sometimes tc betrays a note of helplessness. Last year t managed to recruit b 2,500 new members oa r the a executive class as against ,800 in 1964, but even so it fell 500 tt short of its target. In the case i of the more senior administra- n tive class the percentae short- v fall was even greater. It hade 100 vacancies to fill and could a find only 73 suitable candidates. V There are also big shortages in c the various specialist grades such p as statisticians, who are over a 20 per cent. below the establish s: ment figure, accountants who il are 12 per ent. down, and p an lawyers where there isg a shortage a of 6 per cent. r In the most Junior clerical v class reliable statistics are more b class relirble itatisttci are more b difilcult to find since the recruit* ment for these grades has been handed over to the individual departments so as to leave the commission free to concentrate on the higher ranks. But there is no reason to suppose that the Board of Trade with 170 vacan- cies in London alone is in an exceptional position. In the provinces the situation is easier and most departments are trying to move as much work out of London as possible. In its efforts to fill the gaps in the senior classes the Civil Service Commission has virtually revolutionised its recruiting pro- cedures. Until relatively recently it used to content itself with an- nouncing how many vacancies were open and then sit back and wait for the applications. Now it runs advertising campaigns costing nearly Â£300,000 a year, ten times as much as ted years ago, and has started looking for candidates over a much wider area. The key shortage it in the junior ranks-assistant principal and principal-of the Adminis- trative class, both because the decisions of these officials pro- Svide the work for hundreds of others and because they are the Sofficer cadets of the service. Traditionally the main recruiting Sground has been Oxford and SCambridge, and even now a quarter of the successful appli- Scants are Oxford historians. But Sat last the attempt to persuade f more undergraduates from other universities to come forward is Spaying off, and this year for the e first time more than half the Â° applicants have been non- y Oxbridge. % Borrowed Men However the universities alone n will be unable to flu the.vacan- c cies left by the under-recruiting e of the last few years, and big o efforts are being made to attract It people who have already gone s into industry and other profes- f sions. Last year 25 men were \"borrowed from industry on a d two year secondment, and 70 a were brought in on a permanent o basis. Even so many jobs which were formerly done by principals are having to be done by execu- tive officers, and this is helping to accentuate the shortages in U 'that class., a i;'- n \"the &lt run it' is'lfilcult s to see how the shortages . throughout the Civil Service can it be overcome, and though most 1e senior officials tend to take a 0 \" we can struggle through\" attl. 0 tude, there is a growing fear that t if their departments are given *- much more to do their efficiency It will begin to be seriously im- id paired. Far reaching proposals Id are being considered for merging S, the administrative and executive In classes, and for providing more ,h promotion opportunities for or scientists, economists and other h- specialists. These should help to to increase recruitment and Im. id prove labour mobility within the io service. But they are long term remedies, and the pressure of al work is a problem that has to re be overcome here and now. Olvi SeÂ· :Â·Â·v4r-~~ ji 420 1A 150 '5'",

How is it expected that the ser- vice industries, who have also had to support two rises in fuel tax: increased company taxation, in- creased National Insurance redundancy payments, increased ostape, carriage and rail charges, incrasd rates (now around six times the pre-war amounts in the West and of London) and not pass on some, if not most of this latest imposition? In my view the Prices and In- comes Board on examining mops cases would consider this tax being largely borne by the consumer as Inevitable, and as Mr. Swetman states, that is the object, After all, the Prime Minister himself i. a television interview has recently implied that as the manufacturing industry has purchase-tax, the ser- vice industries now have SET Who does Mr. Bowles imagine pays purchase-tax?

He could even be correct in saying \"most,\" although this term might cover only 51 per cent. of existing mortgages, and yet my contention that the proposal is an attack upon the sanctity of contract would be completely iustifiable.; Mr. Ashworth's statement \"that It is because of the. doctrine of sanctity of contract and ont In spits of it that societies can raise their interest rates\" shows some con- fusion in the use of the Engish languase and is tantamount to say. ing that because one owns a knife one may properly use it either to cut bread or to stab someone in the back. The point is that the proposal to raise interest rates to Other letters Page 11 borrowers without a corresponding increase to depositors and without reference to members, is a UDI (Uniateral Declaration of Increase) for which no case has been proved and which is not supported by the current level of deposits. Some societies are not In agreement with the proposal and this no doubt explains why the Building Societies Association has dithered for so long. Incidentally Mr. Ashworth has unwittingly suggested another reason, In addition tthose out' lined In my letter, as to why there is obstruction to the transfer of mortgages. Could it be that th: creation of new mortgages enable additional clauses to be inserted that were not Included In the original mortgages? can afford to laugh at Mr. Ashworth's suggestin tdat I talked through my hat It would be interesting to know what he was wearing when writing his letter.

This, it is hoped, will give a breakdown of hbortttime and redundancy figures for all BMC plants affected. Meanwhile, at York the Con- federation of Shipbuilding and \"Egineering Unions has called for a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss redundancy problems at BMC and other engineering plants. BMC has already told 800 men at its Bathgate (Scotland) factory, which makes trucks, tractors 'and diesel engines, that they will lose their jobs on October 7. The full- scale redundancy plan-which may involve as manyas,000 worker-r will come into operation on November 4. By then. up to 50,000 out of a total labour force of 112.000 could be on short time. Mr. Jenkins' advice Mr. Roy Jenkins, Home Secre- ary, whose constituency is in Birmingham, said yesterday after a talk with Sir George Harriman, BMCs chairmani \"Talk about a big recession in the Midlands, or a very hard winter ahead is greatly exaggerated . . I think we must all be prepared to face up to these adjustments.\" Mr. Jenkins also. spoke with union ofcials' before and after seeing Sir George, and wheh asked aboot the threats of strike action at shop steward level, commented: \"My advice would certainly be against militant action. Nobody has pretended we can get out of this situation without some adjust- ment.\" The Bathgate workers, where 5,000 are employed, held a mass meeting yesterday to discuss the 800 redundancy notices. When Mr. Andiew Johnston, convenor of the joint shop stewaids committee asked the men whether they would take strike action if redundancy \"'became the ultimate \" only a few raised their hands in sapport Earlier, Mr. David Wilson, Amalgamated Engineering Union shop steward at Bathgate, had told the. workers: \"We will resist re- dutdancy to the full. It is criminal to send workers out when there is only the labour exchange for them.\" Labour MP for West Lothian. Mr. Tam Dalyell who was at the meeting, said afterwards: \"To- morrow I will meet the unions' full-time officials and give them a complete report\" He. would also approach the Scottish Develop- ment Department with a view to speeding industrial development at Livingston New Town to absorb the redundant workers. The Bath. gate plant is in Mr., Dalyell's con- stituency.

The town's piosperity was built on the lace Industry established by immigrant Nottingham workers after the Napoleonic wars: when this declined the town declined, too.. The fact that Calais is no longer offici ally depressed, although wages are still below those of Paris or Lorraine, owes much to the resourcefulness of M, Olivier Le Sourd, head of CEADEC, the local economic development agency. Largest Employers Le Sourd, a tall, dapper anglophile, has helped to per- suade half a dozen British com- panies to settle in the area since he took on his role some five years ago. Two British firms of rather older establishment, Courtaulds and Brampton-a manufacturer of chains and transmission parts for the motor and cycle industries - are already the town's largest em- ployers. Sc.=-! ,. the more recent arrivals, though starting small, promise to be even more important. Undoubtedly Calais' appeal to British business has much to do with the generous investment incentives offered, which at one time were as high as 20 per cent. Several firms, such as British Titan Products, LucasGirling and Johnson Matthe. decided to inves on theb onnent only fter De. 0.pI veto on Brita at t join the Common Market. And the 15 pr c. Commn. Market ex. ^eralI *,rIremaiha the oige. u ,lolenwute to any -rm to ;et up . factq , inn the area. SFor the moment, invest*m t in the region it severely impeded by measures under the 1965 Finance Act, designed to restrict investment by British com- panics outside the sterling area. By the beginning of next year, Tioxide, the BTP subsidiary and the last project in the area to escape the June, 1965, measures, will start to produce Titanium Oxide from its Â£9m. plant BTP's problem is typical of those firms which have in- vested in the Common Market countries. The company had good markets on the Continent, supplied from U.K. plants, but was threatened with the loss of them by Britain's exclusion from the EEC. There would have been advantages in con. centrating production at its Grimsby plant, ihich has ex- panded sixfold since 1948, but at the same time transport costs are heavy, and the firm could hope to sell substantially more in France by being locally based. The tariff factor was decisive, and Tioxide has bought enough land around its resent site to cop. Oftl the potential demand froo tbi BEC ountries for a good man\" years. In tenrm of market pnettra. iion, the most succems\"T Briti frm in tho area-and orobablv in Prance-is Lines Brothe Lib* originally had a factot t~ the Lyons aMeai- wbich' buein ' cause olbbre afte r a cont binatioo of inept labour band linj and Communist dominated unions had caused its closure. The company has fared much better since its purchase of Meccano, which had been doing well in France while its British parent suffered the inroads of Lines and others. Lines- Meccano is now the premier name in French toys, and in a rather fragmented industry, the size and marketing ability of the group suggest that it will achieve a dominating position throughout the EEC. Lines' decision to build at Calais was an inevitable one. After the Lyons debacle, the company was still anxious to have a factory in France. Calais offered proximity to the group's Margate factory, a labour force that was far more tractable than at Lyons, and generous investment incentives. As a toy- maker Lines clearly had to be established in France. French boys want to buy models of French trains and cars, and it is no use trying to sll them tth British variety. The venture, now, inits fourth year, has been outstandingly successful. Labour costs in Calais are superfically very low, at around P3.50 (about 5s) an hour, but oqta the 52-54 per cent.. com- pltlsory, social service levy iq added, they bear comparison with those in North East England, but still much lower than in London. The low wage rates in Pas de Calais, coupled with lower land prices, are part of the reason for the concentra- tion of British firms, which is certainly the largest on the Continent. With the formation of an international Channel Tunnel consortium expected within a few months, and the possible completion of a Tunnel in eight to 10 years, Calais is likely to become even more of a focus for British investment Girling Plant The experience of Girling, which has just established a small plant in an extensively converted farm just outside Calais to produce disc brakes. throws an interesting light on the commercial realities of the Common Market The motor component industry is inten- sively competitive, and large motor firms can usually dictate conditions to their suppliers. Thus, when Girling won a con- tract from Mercedes-Benz it was forced to setup a subsidiary in Koblenz to fit the terms of the order. In Prance, where Girling already supplies Peugeot, French car manufac- turers tend to place orders with French firms; if these are un- able to supply a particular component, the order may go to a Common Market firm, and only failing that to an outsider. As international . competition intensifies in the years ahead and more firms decide to com- pete in specific markets, the practice of having a token local plant on the Girling model may ecome more, not less, neces- sary. If so, Calais really will return in spirit, if not in politi- cal designation, to the empire it left in Queen's Mary's time. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Royal l nurace (see Lex) shows improved underwriting profit in the first half. F. J. Walis In recent years, \" cnsolidation\" seems to have become a stock euph6mism for growth companies goig sour. For . . . Wall, how- ever, it means pre-tax profits 69 per cent, better at Â£174,000 for the first half of 1966. Six new super- markets last year and another three in the past six months have brought the total to 28, includ- inq f1 smaller, self-ervice units. Nothing concrete is contemplated for the rest of this year but profits of at least Â£350.000 are in pros- pet, indicating earnings 30 points higher at 105 per cent. As a close company. Wallis could increase the dividend on that basis by 12 points to 44 per cent., maintaining cover at 2.4 times and retentions in proportion. Whether it will be able to afford it with a Â£%m. warehouse in course of construction is another matter. There are plans for another five or six supermarkets next year, when the new warehousing facili- ties will be able to service them, although Wallis limited to some extent by the Â£50,000 rule on de- velopments. But, meanwhile, it has done quite enough to justify yesterday's 3s rise to 25s, with a prospective P/E raio of just under 12 times. Current yield in 2.6 per cent. Croda Organisation With a 15 per cent. rise in profits (to Â£174,000 pre-tax) resulting from a 3% per cent. rise in sales, Croda Organisation has both reversed the general trend in margins and con- founded the pessimists in the market. This reflects a \"more economic spread of sales,\" which presumably means that Croda, which makes oleo-chemicals. paints, rust preservatives, etc., has been pushing its more profitable lines. There are several small acquisitions under negotiation, but a 15 per cent. rise in annual ptofits would produce earnings of nearly 40 per cent, for the 19 per cent. dividend, and a P/E ratio of iust Over 10 to support the 4.6 per cent. yield at 20s 9d.

When the news of the ultinatuhi has sunk in j44eems likely there will be a brisk Irtl-Brttish reaction. This, it is .thout, could give Mr. Smith's lvgh'iwinig the opportunify to . lo.n.g-staading demand for aseverance of British ties with declaration of a republic. This is allkly to come at once. .Logical Next Step .The .next step would probably await the Rhodesian Front con- 69t; at' Blawayo hett week. To many people here a republic seems . logical next step after UDI, but Mr. Smith may hesitate because he will realise that it willbring a crisis 4t onscience for many essential ... as. 'particularly those civil servnts and soldiers who have sworn an oath of allegiance to the ' Secondly. It is well known that .the Governor has been tired of the lkng tiege and, that Sir Morrice 4aaes came out partly to stiffen his resolve. ;*;people here arc wondering, how- eier'..Whether Britain will be able to '-lld Sir Humphrey Gibbs's sap rt, plfticularly now that the ltimatum held out the prospect of to- independence before majority fult*-* principle which Sir Hum- phrey is strongly opposed to. Sir Morrice saw the Govern6r ..Rhodeshais are not clear about how -ad , *bwen-the Governor is to communicate British plans under the censorship to all sectors of Rhodesian opiion, and about how-or when -the illeal rgimne is to be informed of the ulimatum.

If the rospect 1o eventual and limited sanctiom at th :United Nation is supposed to supp the\" teoth of th ae ulof tuahin i rnghtly or wrongy, the : rnodiarh are not going to be scared. \" In .the eyes at. nmgpt whit, Rhodesians santiop a appled MA far ove fal lted here is s ah o Sadi~,n heprestsil'the ably o dde , to withsaMnd te aend an other sanctios Mr. ,Wilmoa ea-, oa3lrcqtinl reaction is iso be defned with ii~tmlty. Thins di reaction that In probably bec echoed by Mr. Smith when he -eventually - condescends- to comment on the Commonwealth communique. This cotempt of sanctions is not renected'in the buiness community here which is aware of the impact the British sanctions policy has been havIng .o. the Rhodesian economy. But it is in this sector that peoslmis regarding the possibility of an eventual political settlement is most advanced, and this has been accentuated by the ultimatum. These businessmen cannot see any chance of Mr. Smith's seeing sense and yielding his illegal independence under the pressure of this Common- wealth ultimatum. But they cannot view the alternative with any enthusiasm either--they realise that mandatory sanctions might make their lives still more difficult, while in common with the great majority of huropeans here they think African majority rule would be dangerously. prematurr. , h this they almost certainly have an ally in the Governor himself. S. African .Policy aO the most important point of all -the policy of the new South African overnmant-Rhodesians are as much in the dark as anyone else, although Right-Wingers are claiming that Mr. Vorster will without hesitation stand by them. Rhodesians appear to appreciate that the South Africant atitude will be decisive, but they are also aware that Mr. Vorster s an unknown quantity as far as foreign afairn are concerned. Perhaps the main importance of Dr. Verwoerd's death is that Mr. Vorster-whatever his Rhodesian' solicy--will be unable to act as a [oderating influence on the Rhodedian regime at times of crisis is Dr. Verwoerd undoubtedly did. Wr. Vorster is also likely to need ime to play himself in; an early nnouncement of a change in South drica's Rhbdesian policy should not e expected. \"'T;e diicult* in assessing white lodesian opinion-and these days to one bothers even to try to assess he thinking of Rhodesian Africans applies -to reaction to the com- nuniqud as to all-other issues; the ulf between. the. comparative ophisticatidn of a 'few (who are usuallv opponents of. both Mr. Smith nd Mr. Wilson) and the extreme natvete of many Rhodesian Prna suop orter. ' ; Sod at the most sophisticat.e level, tie 'ommo01tili m w eon as remarkably moderate a cd clevr document achieved by Mr. Wils. .under heavy pressurc it is noted that Rhodesia,bÂ«.lit; offered a time for reflection, ind he co muniqud is seen aswarding tat, in terms of eventual settlement i'well as the Impct- of saunton~ thins are going to get much worse. At the simletI level of political analysis the ultimatum is easily dis- missed as making, no difference to an achieved inndpendfc, as further evidence of British perfidy. as the cue for still greater South African assistance and as evidence of the impossibility of going back. No one has ever accused Mr. Smith of sophistication.",

V \" Out of this at leasiiwo ideas concerning Commonwealth aid emergedL Mr. Arnold Smith, the Secretary-General, read a paper to the Conference advocating a Commonwealth aid pool. This idea did not survive the cold water douche delivered by Mr. Arthur Bottomley, U.K. Minister for Overseas Development. Britain did not think this was the time to talk of setting up such a consor- tium. he sald If it would mean increasing Britain's aid commit- ments, then Britain's present position of flnancial stringency was sufficient reason to reject the idea, at least for te, time being. But Mr. Bottomley also invoked an economic Occam's Razor, when he pointed out that there were already enough aid organisations in being. Britain, for her part, had a Ministry purely for the purpose of running a oohesive aid pro gramme, and beildes, between 89 and 90 per cent. of British aid at. present levels already oses to Com- monwealth countries,both on a bi. lateral and a multi-lateral basis. The seiond idea came from Mr. Swaran Sinh, Indian Foreign Min. ilter. Mr. lush said that a major obstacle to the'free Bow of tech. me0l aid and personnel through Ir Commonwealth in recent yea had been the inadequacy of foreign exchange. To rnm.dy this he lu, sited that a Commonwealt rolign xochao fund beo ot up. Mr. Sinlh did not slaborlte tli propopl, but went on to discuss that oontroversial field where aid and ipoliics overlap. \"The aid. iving countries should not try, directly or indirectly, to put politi- cal pressure on the recipients.\" Another idea that emerged yeter. day came from Mr. Forbes Bunbam, and concerned immigration, one tborn which this year's Conference's fles as been spared. \"We inl Guya can supply the space and the oppou nties for West Indiamns rather than reat Britain,\" be said, sakin at lamh to the CointmoerWnWiT of Britain. .r.

   "text_content" : "ANY ONE of at least a dozen horses is capable of winnig the Ayr Gold Cup (3.35) this afternoon, but one who is reasonably certain to give backers a run for their money is Potter, a grey four-year-old colt by Major Portion, owned by Senior Steward of the Jockey Club, Mr. Tom Blackwell and trained at Newmarket by J. Jarvis. Last year, Potter was a convinc- ing winner of the Stewards Cup at Goodwood, and the handicappers were so impressed by his prform- ance that he was allotted lumps of weight for the remainder of the season. Moreover, severe treat- ment has been meted out this year, with the result that he was saddled with 9 st 9 Ibs in the Wokingham Stakes at Ascot, where he ran a magnificent race to finish closeup fourth behind My Audrey, Air Patrol and Barrymore. In his next, and most recent race, Potter carried 9 at 8 lbs into third lace in a handicap at t r, finishing threeUart of a behind Kamsuwr , ttM t later, won the W. V., A. O Wills' Gold Tropy ler.

Irrsper tive of whether Jarvis capture the Gold Cup with Potter, I expect him to land the West of Scotland Trial Handicap (4.5) with The Snob. whose fourth .to Placo at level weights at Newmarket last month reads well in view of Placo's easy victory in the Doncaster Cup. Jarvis may also win the Land of Burns Nursery Handicap (4.35) with topweight Queen Dido, and the Arran Stakes (5.5) with Ben- jamin. At Haydock, The Ambion, a nice filly by Henry the Seventh, is a confident selection for the Lady Hill Plate (3.45). Her form when runner-up to Horned Moon at Newmarket in July and, subse- quently, when dividing Lacquer and Manacle in a nursery handi cap at Sandown a fortnight ago, is distinctly useful.

Continuing to reflect the new swap facilities and the moves in the U.S. to bring the rise in interest rates under control, British Funds made another good showing in Stock Markets yesterday. Turn. over was fairly good again and, with a better two-way business developing, prices made further headway in more comfortable trading conditions. Other fixed interest stocks also gained more ground and the five new debentures which started life yesterday were afforded an active reception. Equities were opened higher after Wednesday's setback, senti- ment being helped by the over- night rise on Wall Street. Attend- ance was affected by the Jewish New Year holiday ahd trading was very slow to develop. Official markings were still well below average at 6.795 compared with 7.170 on Wednesday and 6,579 on Thursday of last week. In the absence of sellers, however, prices of the leaders hardened further and closed on a firm note. THE SINAN. CIAL TIMES Industrial Ordinary share index was 1.1 better at 10.30 a.m. and 1.4 up at noon. This re- mained the position at 2.45 p.m. and by the close the index, at 304.2, was showing a rise 6f 1.6. Few features appeared, but Insur- ance shares went better in the later trading when the Royal Insurance halfyeary tesults were announced. Outside the leaders prices of equities were enerally mixed, rises and falls in FT. quoted Industrials being. fairly evenly matched at about 11 percent.

   "article_dc_title" : "Ministry Prepares to Deal with Bmc Redundancies",
   "text_content" : "BIRMINGHAM, Sept. 15. The Ministry of Labour regional office here was to-day completing arrangements for deal. ing with redundancies at British Motor Corporation plants, and the possibility of more than 50,000 Midlands vehicle and component workers being put on short time in the next few weeks. A special headquarters bureau is being set up and additional staff recruited for those offices likely to come under heaviest pres sure. Ministry of Labour departments are also to be set up within factories- such as Austin, where redundancies will be substantial --to facilitate job changes. The extra work will stretch to the limit staffs already under pres- sure from the recently introduced Selective Employment Tax and earnings related benefits, under which unemployment benefits (for which short-timers qualify) are related to average earnings in the recent past. While memories of 1956-when BMC sacked 6,000 at a moment'i notice-are still sharp, the present situation is not likely to pose quite such acute problems. For one thing there is a breathing-space until November 4, befor- redundancies take effect, and foi another, training schemes are more numerous. Government trairing centred al C r t SRirmin 1hurn T Arafr and T ^n Birmingham, Leicester, and Long Eaton (near Nottingham) have been extended, and are being en- larged still further, while a train- ing centre is being set up at Coventry alongside the industrial rehabilitation centre, In addition training centres are in process of being established in other towns. Companies have also rapidly in- creased their own training facili- ties to meet the new Government requirements. Antipathy But, while prospects for rede- ploying redundant workers have become appreciably better, there is a long-standing antipathy to engag- ing ex-car workers, whom expert- ence has shown are prone to return to their more highly paid jobs when motor manufacturers resume building up labour torces. No one is in the mood to try to belittle the task of reabsorbing workers, least of all to draw con- clusions from the registers of out- standing vacancies. Vacancies These showed an August count of 17,862 .unfilled Jobs for men in the Midlands region, of which 7,000 were in engineering. includ- ing electrical engineering. In Bir- mingham itself the total was 5,000 unfilled jobs, of which nearly 3.000 are estimated to be in engineering. By November the unfilled vacancies in this region, where one in 12 of the workers is directly or indirectly engaged in vehicle and component manufacture will almost certainly be considerably fewer.

   "text_content" : "MADRID, Sept. ,15. AFTER AN almost continuous deficit in the first half of this year, the Spanish balance of payments has registered a surplus of almost $25m. in July and close to S60m. in August, according to provisional figures released here. 1- t. 11 h d It )r d II ly This increased income of foreign exchange came mainly from the tourist trade, and another surplus is expected for September. - Despite a revival of exports, the trade balance has registered a defcit of Ptas.77,000m. (about Â£462m.) in the first half of this year. A down. ward movement of imports was felt in the last few weeks but will probably not last for long now that the current credit squeeze s slacken. ing its tight grip on the Spanish economy. Increased Imports In the coming months may lead to a total balance of payments deficit of close to 300m. at the end of the year. I confirmed this means that Spain's gold and foreign exchange reserves will drop below the S1,000m. level, aanst almost Sl,00Om. two years ago.",

It gives to operators of small fleets the advantages now available only to the largest operators. Vehicles operating within a 25. mile radius of base will be given a 15 per cent. discount. Vehicles used for business only and less than 15 cwt get 10 per cent. A 10 per cent. discount is available for vehicles with driving restricted to one named person, and 10 per cent. is offered to contracts carrying a Â£10 voluntary excess for accidental damage. The Assoclaton yesterday issued a guide to the selective employment tax. It gave a warning that relund of the tax could not be ured where It would noot thrwi be available, by setting up a separate transport sub. sidliry whlch would operate vehicles under Contraet A licence and then rank as a hauleM contractor.

   "text_content" : "This concert marked the Arst appearance at the Proms of Jascha Horenstein and the first perform. ance there of Mahler's Ninth Symphony. Horenstein at his best is a Mahler conductor equal to any to-day. He was at his best and most penetrating ta nigh4, and since the London Smniphony Orchestra were with him to a man it was a memorable performance. Attention was compelled at the outset by the hot, raw quality of the horn's tone in the unsettling phrases that alternately oppose and echo the long mjlody gradually built up by the trings. It was never relaxed throughout the four Ilong movements, played with sear- ,i intensity, vivid colours, harsh when necessary, and a control of pace and direction that still allowed an infinite amount of expressive detail. There was some Untidy Splaying, when things weren't in the strict sense \"together,\" but the ensemble in the deeper sense at thinking, shaping and feeling with the conductor, was not to be faulted. The changes of speed, notably in the second movement, were handled with unerring sure- ness. Some of these changes were a little more violent than Mahler's markings imply, but in this hall, where vagueness is a constant danger, they gave the music admir- able definition. The LSO's playin. had trsemendous awareness and intelliloe. The horns and the frst larnet must be siled out it only beause Mahler givs them. things to do.,Te strigs were ex p liuoatlty rsiopsive, the violin. aevr \"m.aingan ugly sound, traeing the exposdd lines at the end of the fl&ale wt infallible accuracy. Horenstein's treatment of the Adagio was utterly devoid of sentimentality, miles away from the usual programmatic notions of death, life, sorrow, etc. It was pure, transfigured, without selfpity. The Mahler overshadowed Busoni's Indian Fantasy, which was the Prom's tribute to his centenary. It isn't an easy work, even for an enthusiast, to defend very warmly. The piano part is beautifully written; and was masterfully played last night,by John Ogden. There is some typically limpid orchestral writing, but the Red Indian tunes Busom used are, with one excep- tion, desperately unexciting, and little is done to diguise the fact. The temperature remains distinctly low. Sometime's Busoni's horrified reaction to the tough, vulgar Italian virtuoso racket led him, for all his own superior virtuosity, to cultivate a sort of deliberate dilettantism. This is music that one could imagine to be written by a composer in a novel-a novel, of course, of high literary distinction.",

   "text_content" : "by DAVID CAIRNS Nothing falls apart more easily than the production of a work like The Barber of Seville. T'or the re- vivil which opened last night Sadler's Wells have been at pains to revitalise and even drastically re- vise the performance which has been doing faithful business off and on for the last six years. Gone are the townspeople, the rubber- neckers and importunate violet. Ssellers who used to erupt onto the stage at the conclusion of the second act, awaking alarm and de- spondency in the breast of at least one member of the audience. Gone are the lavish soapsuds flying in all directions (the shaving of Dr. Bartolo is still, of course; there, but its function is limited to that de- manded by the plot; it is not made into a sort of sideshow on its own). Perhaps I traduce the original version of this production, which certainly had its good points and which indeed I remember liking when it was new. But this sort of change does no harm. There mav well be those, however, who regret the more obvious energy and exuberance of former times. To my mind there is plenty of fun re maining in this revival (as last night's appreciative audience seemed to agree). It is certainly not lacking in character, force and pungency. But its points, many of them at least, do not come into the category of \" business.\" They tend to spring from the music. If this is less amusing in the short run, in the long run it is more satisfying. The musical side of things is very much of a piece with this approach. The opera is conducted -admirably-by Roderick Brydon, a young conductor of whom we shall undoubtedly hear a great deal more. Again I can imagine people finding his interpretation too measured, not sufficiently spark- ling, though I think they would be wrong to make too much of it, He eschews empty brilliance and in doing so sometimes misses a genuine fizz, Both the beginning and the end of the second act struck me as lacking in animation, But he more than compensates by the warmth and humanity he discovers in the music that are so often ignored. He has a splendid sense of rhythm, and can create the space necessary for a phrase to shape itself in without letting it lose its tension and sag in the. process; he produces crisp textures and has a feeling for the varying weight and density of chords-all essential Rossinian qualities; and under him the orchestra plays with unusual clarity, sonority and style. The cast has many newcomers. Even Eric Shilling's Bartolo is re- studied into a sad. small, strabismic old gentleman, irascible but im- potent, defeated from the start; the famous eyebrows, twitching nose and shooting jaw are little in evidence, but it is a likeable and effective impersonation. The Alamaviva, Ryland Davies. has an attractive, mellifluous and well managed voice. He is at present a rather subdued Count, with a faintly melancholy air about him which hardly suggests the romantic, amorous adventurer of the plot. But under the influence of a disguise-the second one at least-he blossoms; the music lesson scene is delightfully played (once again with a quiet sense of fun that is refreshing). And he is always a pleasure to listen to. So is the Rosina, Janet Coster, a mezzo with a strong, sensual voice that makes you sit up the moment she strikes up from the balcony, a dark lively eye under languorous lids, and a keen, formidable per- sonality that together succeed in suppressing regrets even for the divine mischievousness and in- comparable stylishness of Miss Kern in the part. Only David Bowman's vigorous, sardonic personality and sure stage sense seem oddly out of place in the role of Figaro. Noel Mangin repeats his marvellously funny Basillo, a huge conception of dreadful relish, downy as a chick, a monstrous fledgling egret, with a fascinating relationship with his umbrella which is used for heaven-appealing gestures of apocalyptic grandeur and for stealthy movements of almost feline delicacy.",

   "text_content" : "by DAVID ROBINSON However exasperating the Venice Festival proper can be,' there is always the consolatlp-, 'of the Retrospective, which year by year seems to become more imaginative. This year's theme was \"America allo Specchio \" the 30 films, all made between 1921 and 1929, dere selected to reflect America's dream image of herself in the turbulent, optimis- tic, self-esteeming era which began with, Harding's swash- buckling -administration and ended suddenly with the Stock Market crash. It proved good timing to revive the films at this particular moment. After four lecades the historical evolution of taste has progressed far enough for us to have a new view and a new perspective on the physical appearances of those times. At this distance the clothes and decors and hairstyles no longer seem quaint, or even hideous, as they did five years, or even a couple of years, ago. Absurd they still may be, but we can begin to admire the extravagance of the post-cubist interiors, or the great swirling staircases and colossal curved arches which herald the jazz-modern style, or the swathed furs and tiny fringed skirts of the Charleston age. Fashions in women's looks change too. Some faces are classic; Florence Vidor, Louise Brooks, Alice Joyce or Garbo would be beauties in any day and age; but now (perhaps Mary Quant has somethmg to do with it) we can also start to see again the more individual attractions of the young Joan Crawford, or Gloria Swanson or Clara Bow. The girls, as it happens, have stood the test of time better than their male counterparts. The popular heroes of those times- John Mack Brown, William Haines, John Gilbert, Victor Varcoqi-now seem oddly colourless beside their partners. One reason for this may be a peculiar feminism that per- vades the films. It is not the maternalism that was later to seem so characteristic of American society; but a stage in the progress towards it-an attitude towards the male-female relationship that seems to have derived in equal parts from post-war emancipation and from pre-war fictional images of the wife and mother as the one whose lot is to suffer and to atone. Throughout practically every film it is the woman who is adoring, devoted, faithful, sacrificing: the man who philanders and allows himself to be distracted and seduced by The Wrong Girl. In Stage Struck, for instance, Gloria Swanson. as the little waitress, does Lawrence Gray's laundry and even buys him new shirts, while he flirts with show-boat actresses. In Love 'Em and Leave 'Em the same actor is a window-display man who secures promotion on the strength of ideas given him by the self- effacing Evelyn Brent. True love, in the nature of things Hollywood. always triumphs (or nearly always: in Dancing Mothers Alice Joyce walks out on her pleasure - loving husband and daughter, despairing that they will ever recover from the selfish hedonism which the films all fatalistically accept as the prevail- ing mal du siacle). The men, one feels, simply do not deserve the cliche, or the wonderful girls it gives them. These heroines of the Roaring Twenties are tough and pretty and saucy, with endless funds of re- source and energy and wit and spirit They dance till dawn and then Charleston all the wvay home. They admire good-looking men without inhibition, and pursue them without reserve. They sport a rich vocabulary'of now-vanished slang. \" Hot socks! \" they exclaim on seeing a likely trousered quarry; and faced with a female rival, \" I'll soon take the snap out of her garters! \"' But their toughness is exercised to protect their purity, not to dis- Spose of it; and the man who gets \"fresh\" (which maybe only means a peck in the back of a cab) will probably end up with a sock in the law. Or if he's too much of a gentleman for that sort of treat- ment, the girl will gamely get out of the car and walk home (the now veteran cars which play so large a role in these films have, of course, acquired their own romantic associations). The stars who created this image of young America were themselves a vital part of the twenties scene; yet it comes almost as a surprise to find that the legends-or most of them-were fully justified. They really were goddesses. \"We didn't need to talk,\" says Norma Des- mond (Gloria Swanson) in Sunset Boulevard: \"We had faces.\" And they had. Swanson herself was a superb comedienne. Stage Struck opens, with a colour sequence of the daytdreams of the little waitress who longs to go into the movies. With a tremendous sense of self- caricature, she acts out all the conventional novelette fantasies of the life and art of the diva. One had guessed at Swanson's talent The real discovery of the Venice programme was Clara Bow, who was seen both in her most famous film, It, and in a support- ing role (\"Kittens Westcourt\") in Dahcing Mothers. Tremen- dously witty and vital, she was an actress too, with a distinctive subtle humour, seen at its best in a sequence where, as a poor little shopgirl she is taken to dinner at the Ritz. (The films, as might have been expected, are all very much taken up with social dis- tinctions). Marion Davies, remembered best as William Randolph Hearst's best friend, has been done a dis- service (largely perhaps since Citizen Kane invited us too readily to identify her too closely with Susan Alexander, Kane's talentless proteg6e). She proves in fact to have been a comedienne with skill enough to satirise the pretensions of Hollywood itself. In The Patsy she does cruelly critical impersonations of Pola Negri, Clara Bow and Lillian Gish. In Show People she ridicules the affectations of the twenties divas, down to the primped lips and protruded front teeth which then seemed obliga- tory to pin-up poses. If the in- fluence of Hearst shows in this film, it is in the readiness with Which the stars of the day have provided their services to it. There is even a brief performance (unrecorded in the reference books) by Chaplin. The comediennes had a spunk and spirit- that has now practically vanished. They thought nothing of falling in and out of rivers and waterbutts; and Swanson has a long scene in Stage Struck in which, wearing a stocking over her head, she boxes with a woman twice her size and ends up by falling over the side of a ship and hanging by her drawers from a nail. \"Oh Lord,\" prays the captain, \"Give strength to her trousers.\" Perhaps it is this gusto which made the comediennes survive better than what Marion Davies calls disre- spectfully \"the sob brigade.\" With one exception. Garbo, it is easy to see now, was a miracle. Even in the days of the silent film she was an actress of power enough to give a sort of majesty even to a bastardised adaptation of Michael Arlen's The Green Hat (A Woman of Affairs, 1928; directed by Clarence Brown). She soars above the dead-weight of the male performances (John Mack Brown, John Gilbert, Lewis Stone, Doug- las Fairbanks Jr.)-and of period sentiment, to give sublimity to lines (seen, remember, not heard) like \"You have taken from me the one gracious thing in my life.\" A scene in which she buries her face in a bunch of roses has already all the magic, of the bedroom scene in Queen Christina. The cinema, with its ability to crystallise fleeting youth and the ephemeral moment, is a disturb- ingly nostalgic medium. Behind everything else in these films, behind the immediate preoccupa- tions with passing fashions and the commercial make-haste, they convey the joie de vivre of the people who made them. They are all-directors and actors as well- so young at the time (as witness the number of them, like King Vidor, Frank Capra, Swanson and Crawford who are still working, 40 years later); and though the films constantly reiterate the beloved Hollywood cliche of the suffering and heartbreak that lies behind the make-up smile, they were all, at the very moment of making the films, in the full hap- piness of success. There is an almost documentary conviction about the parties and the yachts and the clubs which provide the settings for so much of the action. \" It feels so good-just to be alive,\" exclaims Wild Diana Merrick (Joan Crawford) in Our Dancing Daughters: and the joy still com- municates itself, giving a strange poignancy to these celebrations of youth and beauty and success under Californian suns that set more than 40 years ago.

   "text_content" : "The end of the summer is tradi- tionally a thin time forfthe London cinemas, with distributors saving their better product for the autumn season. The most entertaining film of the week is certainly The Sleep- Ing Car Murders (Compartiment Tueurs), which opens at the Conti- nentale and Paris-Pullman. Frankly commercial in its inten- tions, it is a craftsmanlike first film by Costa Gavras, a young (33-year. old) French director of Oreco. Russian parentage. The plot is dottily inconsequential; the interest of the film lies in its exuberance and its naive enjoyment of the pollcler conventions-the anti- romantic detective hero with a head-cold (Yves Montand); the bored Interrogations; the red herrings; the final cliff-hanger chase. It has, moreover its own dis- tinctive humour which finds outlet in some predictably enjoyable star and cameo performances. Simone Signoret plays wittily and touchlngly as an ageing stage beauty elated by her last young love; Signoret's daughter, Catherine Allegret, gifted at least with her mother's fascinating eyes, Is an inoffensive ingdnue; and Jacques Perrin, whose career (to judge from the two roles which won him the Volpi Cup at Venice) is now likely to take him away from this admittedly facile sort of role, plays charmingly as the awkward and inexperienced student hero. Other players in. clude Michel Piccoli and Jean. Louis Trintignant. * The Trap (Leicester Square Theatre) appears to be yet another ill-fated attempt to launch feature film production in Canada. This one starts with the insuper- able handicap of a story that i ludicrous almost beyond belief, Eve, a dumb orphan living in a pioneering settlement In British *Columbia some time in the 19th century, is sold by her foster. mother to a tough, untamed, un. elvillsed trapper called, appro. prlately, Jean La Bbte. She is repelled by La Btte's habits, which Include disgusting table manners and an irritating way of bawling out the same verse of the same song all the time, She begins, however, to tame him, saves his life, but then gets carried off by the rapids and eventually lands tp in the settlement she first started from, On the point of emharking on a somewhat In. expllcable marriage with someone else, she runs off and returns t( La Bbte. One might suppose that thi improbable farrago was aimed a a juvenile audience were it not tha the film shows a penchant toward a sadistic horror which would no shame a Hammer production. Jeal gets his foot practically severed ii a hear trap; and subsequently Ev4 amputates his festering leg witi one swift stroke of a wood chopper. Besides this, scenes sucl as that n which she stumbles Inti a camp of Indian corpses; or thi calculated sadism of making he shoot a baby deer to which shi had become attached, seem com patatively mild.

S. 4KQ85 * K Q 8 5 -0 AJ 2 09543 693 North, my partner, dealt, and at L love score bid 1 club, to. which made the atural reply of 1 pade. West came iq with 2 heats, i dangerous bid which piht asily be doubled for a penalty of ;00 or 700 points, if the cards lie adly. After North had raised to I spades, I with my strong hieart lolding tried 3 NT, but North ightly went back to 4 spades. West with some discernment led he seven of spades, ducked in lummy and covered by the nine mnd Queen. In most hands it is :orrect to play on the long suit, mnd this hand is no exception. kpart from the attempt to estab- lish long cards in the suit, the play ias two other purposes. First, it iffords entry into the South hand n order to ruff hearts in dummy; secondly, it helps Discovery, the ittempt to learn the distribution of the unseen hands. Trick 2 was won by dummy's :lub Ace, and a small club went to East's Knave. I won the three of hearts with my Ace, and at once ruffed a heart in dummy. Now :ame a club, on which East threw Mis heart King, ruffed with the five of trumps. The heart discard was most illuminating. I can place West with six hearts and four :lubs. With a Queen-high suit she must surely have the King of jiamonds. Anyhow, the diamonds must be tested, so I finesse the Queen successfully. Now I know the entire hand. Another club from the table is ruffed with the eight of trumps, East letting go a diamond, and a diamond to the Ace leaves this position: N. * A 10 06 6 10 W. E. SQ987 *J43 0J S. 4 K OJ 095 I have eight tricks already, and the Ace and King of trumps will provide two more, but I can make an overtrick. I lead the club from the table, and East lets go the diamond (ruffing does not help him). I can run the club and make eleven tricks, but I ruff with my trump King. I need to unblock this King-this makes it a Vienna coup-and because the club.is a winner, it is surely a grand Vienna coup. Now a diamond forces East, who holds only trumps, to take the trick, and lead into dummy's fourchette.",
