   "text_content" : "By Paul Bette and Roland Rudd SIR Roland Smith was last night forced out from the chairmanship of British Aero- space, one of the largest UK manufacturing groups, at the climax of a day of high drama at the company's London head- quarters. Sir Graham Day, chairman of BAe's Rover Group subsid- iary, becomes interim chair- man in place of Sir Roland. Sir Roland, who held the chairmanship since 1987, has come' under intense pressure from fellow directors and City institutions following the bun- gled launch earlier this month of a Â£432m rights issue and warnings that BAe profits this year will be sharply below expectations. The departing chairman said he had decided to go \"in order to end the damaging specula- tion about the future of the company\". He wanted to allow the management of the com- pany to \"implement its strat- egy without any of the ubcer- tainties\" which had surfaced since the announcement of the rights issue on September 11. The change represents the culmination of a process of increasing disenchantment towards Sir Roland both within the company and in the wider investment community. In par- ticular, his independent man- agement style and his ten- dency to negotiate deals without always keeping his fel- low directors and managers II Leader toppled by unstoppable momentum; Day adds another feather to his career cap, Page 28 * Lex, Page 26 informed, were pointed to as leading tension. It emerged yesterday that in the past year Sir Roland had made an unsuccessful attempt to bring BAe into a merger which intensified frictions inside his group. The groundswell of feeling against the chairman mounted sharply when the company went into its rights issue. The BAe board is understood to have decided unanimously at the beginning of this week to force Sir Roland out. Sir Roland is understood to have put up a strong fight and the fact that the announce- ment came only after a series of delays last night indicated the board's difficulties in per- suading him to go. The failed merger attempt had involved Trafalgar House, the construction and engineer- ing group. Sir Roland approached Sir Nigel Broackes, Trafalgar House chairman, in April with a detailed proposal for a merger between the two companies. The two held a series of meetings before the proposals were discussed by the Trafalgar House board. The get-together would have entailed creating a company to incorporate BAe and Trafalgar House. In the event, the pro- posals were rejected by the Trafalgar House board and Sir Roland was subsequently crit- icised by some BAe directors for his handling of the affair. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, and Mr Dudley Eus- tace, the finance director, also criticised this plan. The subsequent handling and loss of the UK government contract to manage the EH101 Merlin Helicopter project, which finally went to a part- nership between International Business Machines and West- land is understood to have added to tensions. But it was the misfortunate launch of the rights issue - leaked days before the official announcement - and the asso- ciated profits warning that raised the curtain on the final act in the drama. Since the rights issue announcement, BAe shares have lost about a quarter of their value. Sir Graham said that in his role as interim chairman he planned to ensure that Mr Evans and his fellow managers had a stable environment to implement the strategies set out in the rights issue docu- ment. He said Mr Evans and his team had the \"fullest sup- port\" of the whole BAe board. Sir Graham told the Sinan- cial Times BAe needed to press Continued on Page 26 BAe chief Continued from Page 1 ahead to try to deliver the busi- ness strategy outlined in the rights issue prospectus. This will involve focusing on the group's core businesses of defence, commercial aircraft, motor vehicles and property and construction and avoiding long-term aircraft development programmes. This implied the need for partners in its regional aircraft operations. His task would be to try to rebuild confidence in the com- pany which had been badly damaged as a result of the cri- sis of the last few weeks. \"You can lose confidence quite quickly but you don't rebuild it very quickly\", he said. He said BAe required as chairman someone prepared to put in between five and seven years: \"That's not me. I'm not prepared to do that. I like to keep life simple and put my personal position up front.\" But he added: \"I promise I will not just sit around.\" He conceded there was also the need to rebuild a consensus within the company and to heal wounds and rifts. Sir Graham said he was com- pletely satisfied and confident UFin ose Forced out: Sir Roland, pictured last night, came under pressure over the rights issue in BAe's bankers, Kleinwort Benson and Hoare Govett, which he felt had \"unfairly taken a lot of stick\" over the leaked rights issue. The changeover will take Splace on October 7, when BAe , plans an extraordinary general Smeeting. Mr George Simpson, SRover chief executive, will also take on the chairmanship of Sthe cars subsidiary. Along with relinquishing the Rover post, Sir Graham is tak- ing temporary leave of absence as non-executive director of the Laird Group, MAI and Thorn EMI",

Inspectors of the Interna- tional Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog, have pene- trated the ramparts of the al- Tuwaitha compound in repeated missions over the past four months. The inspec- tors' investigations have pro- voked a growing confrontation between Baghdad and the UN. In the latest incident a UN team has been detained in the compound of Iraq's atomic energy administration in Baghdad, after refusing to sur render copies of files identify ing staff behind the pro grarmme. A breakthrough in the impasse appeared possible early today. Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee, the French president Continued on Page 26 Possible breakthrough, Page 4 Iraq's nuclear research centre Continued from Page 1 of the UN Security Council, said Iraq had delivered a letter which \"does not look nega- tive\" about the inspectors.

The pictu, taken recently, shows the remains of al-Ta- waitha's 90 buildinags which, ntil the Gulf war, serve as the centre of Iraq's nuclear weapons research. The site, bombed by Israel in 1981 and again by the allies in the Gulf war, Is at the en- tre of a heavily patrulled mili- tary area.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent The Old Lady, less familiarly the Bank of England, has turned school ma'am. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank, yester- day revealed that it was acting as schoolteacher to the central bankers of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Bank aims to reveal to them the mysteries of the modem market economy. The Centre for Central Bank- ing Studies intends to play a leading role in saving the emerging market economies of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union from hyper-inflation and monetary mismanagement. Its sole weapon is know- ledge, nowadays called \"techni- cal assistance\". Already this year 135 foreign central bank- ers, mainly from eastern and central Europe, have attended training courses. More are expected to follow and the Bank will take its expertise to Prague and Buc- harest in the next six months as well as planning two courses in London for officials from the Soviet Union. The first of these, a fortnight-long course in October, will cater for senior bank supervisors from the republic state banks and will run in co-operation with Barclays Bank and Mid- land Montagu. In a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce yester- day, Mr Leigh-Pemberton underlined the extent of the problems the new centre had been set up to overcome. \"The threat of hyper- Inflation in the Soviet Union is real and imminent\", while cur- rent control mechanisms were \"dangerously inadequate\", the governor said. \"A mechanism needs to be found, and soon, to restore budgetary constraint and effective control over the money supply.\" Mr Leigh- Pemberton said that under the old command economy system, central banks had \"next to nothing to do with the price level\". In the emerging market economies \"they will, I hope, have everything to do with it.\" He addedL \"But they will be operating in a very unfamiliar environment.\" The Bank was therefore prepared \"as a mat- ter of urgency\" to help the cen- tral banks of the Soviet Union and eastern and central Europe to learn to make judgments about interest and exchange rates and to devise techniques for controlling credit and liquidity based on market operations. The Bank has passed on expertise before, to high-fliers from Commonwealth central banks. But the new centre, with 10 staff and its own direc- tor of central banking studies, is its first formal facility. An unofficial estimate put the cost at more than Â£2m a year. Western central banks have been keen to send their know- ledge and influence east. The much smaller Austrian National Bank, for example, provided training for more than 700 central bankers from eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the first half of 1991.

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels and John Hunt in London THE European Commission agreed yesterday after more than two years of debate on a controversial proposal for an energy tax equivalent to $10 a barrel of oil by the year 2000. Brussels wants member states to introduce the tax - based in part on the carbon content of fuels - gradually, starting with a $3 levy in Janu- ary 1993, and rising by $1 each year until 2000. The object is to meet the EC's commitment to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the end of the century, as well as to promote energy efficiency and security of supply. Ministers of the Organisa- tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Geneva, immediately expressed concern about the proposed tax, saying that \"oil is already dispropor- tionately taxed at the con- sumption end\". \"Any additional tax, intended for environmental or other purposes, will adversely affect free trade among nations,\" a statement said. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, Continued on Page 26 Tory 'green' record, Page 10 Editorial Comment, Page 24 Brussels calls for EC tax on energy contined from Pa i said that although the Commu- nity generated only 13 per cent of world CO2 emissions, against 23 per cent from the US, the Community's contribu- tion to global warming was increasing because of the fall in oil prices. Fiscal weapons to combat this were \"the least expen- sive\", and sent a signal to con- sumers and industry that \"environmental costs must be internalised\". Projected increases in the cost of individual fuels - made when Brussels was working on a tax falling 25 per cent on oil and 75 per cent on other forms of energy - vary widely. In industry the cost of coal would rise 30.3 per cent by 1995, and 60.6 per cent by 2000. The equivalent figures for heavy fuel oil are 23.6 and 29.6 per cent; for natural gas 18.9 and 31 per cent; and for elec- tricity, 8.1 and 16.3 per cent. Under the Commission's plan, the tax would be offset by tax cuts in other areas. \"We are talking about changing the balance of the existing tax sys- tem in favour of the environ- ment,\" a senior official said. The EC has no tax-raising powers, so member states would levy the charge. The British government, out- lining a report on the environ- ment yesterday, said it was against levying an energy tax unilaterally, although it was prepared to enter a debate on the Commission's proposals. Mr David Trippier, environ- ment minister, said: \"We have set our face against taking that kind of action unilaterally because it would be disastrous for Britain's industry,\" he said. Two thirds of EC members were against such a tax. Mr Ripa di Meana said the tax would fall evenly, in a 50-50 split, on fossils fuels graded according to their carbon con- tent, and all other forms or non-renewable energy. Thus, the $10 a barrel of oil bench- mark would translate into a $14 levy on the equivalent amount of coal-fired energy, but a $5 tax on the same amount of nuclear-produced energy. Industries with high energy consumption which are \"open to international competition\" would almost certainly be spared the brunt of the levy, unless the RC was able to secure commitments from the US and Japan to introduce sim- ilar tax regimes. The steel, chemicals, non-fer- rous metals, cement, glass, paper and packaging sectors - energetic lobbyists against the plan - were cited as probable exemptions. The proposals are in the form of a discussion paper for the EC Council of member states, but the Commission hopes to get the go-ahead to draft a directive before the end of the year. In macroeconomic terms, the Commission says the tax would at worst cause only a slight reduction in growth, of up to a tenth of 1 per cent by 2000. It could, however, increase inflation by 0.3-.5 per cent a year.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb THE leaders of Croatia, Serbia and the federal defence minis- try yesterday agreed to negoti- ate a lasting ceasefire, while the federal army said it would pull out of the besieged eastern Croatian town of Vinkovci within five days. The accord, agreed during a secret meeting between Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, Mr Slobodan Milos- evic, the president of Serbia, and Mr Velko Kadijevic, the federal defence minister, could now pave the way for opening up political negotiations among Yugoslavia's republics. Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Mr TudJman, said last night \"it was a significant develop- ment\", but added it was \"still unclear what will happen in the republic of Bosnia-Hercego- vina\". Federal troops and Serb paramilitary units are now located in the south west and in the northern part of that republic. Croat officials also said that yesterday's meeting, called at the request of Mr Kadijevic, is seen as an attempt by the fed- eral army to \"retreat honoura- bly\" from Croatia. They added that the army had been weak- ened because of the growing number of deserters and disar- ray among its ranks. The accord comes on the eve of the resumption of the Euro- pean Communnity-sponsored peace conference which opens in The Hague today. Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Mr Tudjman, said yesterday Croatia would not accept any move by the EC to consolidate territorial gains made by Mr Milosevic in order to secure peace in Yugoslavia. Mr Nobilo acknowledged that Serb militants in Krajina, the self-proclaimed autono- mous region in south-western Croatia, would fight rather than accept life in an indepen- dent Croatia, and he said Croa- tia was ready to offer a wide degree of political and cultural autonomy to the Serb minority in the republic. The government of Croatia believes it is now in a position of military and political strength to argue its case in The Hague, following army desertions and the capture of army tanks. Mr Nobilo said the ceasefire, agreed between the federal army and Croatia last Sunday, and which appears to be hold- ing, has given the government in Zagreb an opportunity to \"regroup its forces...\" The success of negotiations also hinges on stability in Bos- nia-Hercegovina, where Bos- nian officials say federal army and Serb paramilitary units are poised to use north-eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina as a bridgehead to link part of west- ern Croatia's Adriatic coast and Krajina with the eastern towns of Vincovci and Osijek in Slavonia.",

Despite official statements that over 93 per cent of reserv- ists in three Serbian towns had reported to local draft boards, antiwar activists claim at least 20 per cent have refused to fight. More than 2,000 reservists who were mobilised in Kragu- jevac had abandoned their positions, said Borba. A further 300 reservists from a battalion from Valjevo left Croatia after an army officer promised they would not be prosecuted. Reservists complain that they are being sent to the front without training. \"I was given a sniper rifle, which I have no idea how to use,\" said one deserter. He said many were sent without ammunition. The army appears to be plan- ning an aggressive campaign to stem further desertions.",

A government communiqud imposed the deadline after a night of sporadic shooting in which four people died and five were injured. Hospitals in the city were on full alert again last night in the expectation of more violence. Speaking inside Georgia's TV centre, Mr Tengiz Sigua, the opposition leader, said the demand to disarm was nothing new. Mr Gamsakhurdia had given the same order to the national guard during August's failed coup in Moscow, but Mr Tengiz Kitovani, commander of the guard, had refused, and had led a rebel unit into hiding outside Tbilisi. \"I am more than sure that his reaction will be the same now,\" Mr Sigua said. \"If he dis- arms, this will be the start of mass repression, against which the national guard is our only guarantee.\" A shooting incident in the early hours of yesterday in the Didube suburb of Tbilisi, in which two government militia men and one rebel guardsman died, provoked a war of words. The government claimed it happened after 40 rebel troops surrounded an administrative building of the electricity sup- ply system, with the intention of cutting off electricity to the city. The opposition claimed the shoot-out occurred after a rebel guardsman, who was taking his sick wife to hospital, was arrested at a militia checkpoint and taken into the electricity control centre. Government forces opened fire as opposition soldiers were attempting to secure his release. In a separate incident, the opposition accused the govern- ment of provocation after two gunmen opened fire from an upper-storey window not far from the TV centre. When rebel guardsmen seized the building, part of Tbi- lisi's Polytechnic Institute, they found a student who had allegedly been murdered by the gunmen.",

The crowds, who had stoned and petrol-bombed the Victory square building, fled down side streets after a large force of troops wearing gas masks launched their offensive. The rioting began after more than 7,000 coalminers from the west Romanian Jiu Valley coalfield hijacked trains to Bucharest to press for pay rises, a price freeze and the government's resignation. The miners, their faces still black from the pits, were joined by local people and together they stormed the building. They hurled stones, petrol bombs and other mis- siles and fought fierce hand-to-hand battles with riot control forces. It was the worst rioting in Romania since clashes involv- ing miners and demonstrators in June 1990. Initial hospital reports said at least seven miners and three policemen were wounded but Romanian television film Indicated the number of injured was far higher. Protesters ran to public tele- phones to call neighbours and friends to join the attack. Shouts of \"Come and help the miners\" rang out in the square and the crowds of locals grew. The government said it would resort to \"all legal means\" to crash the riots. \"This is the second Geor- gia,\" shouted some young peo- ple, referring to a revolt against the Soviet republic's government. Some 52,000 Jiu Valley min- ers went on strike on Tuesday after failing to win pay rises in talks with the authorities. They demanded a freeze on prices, which Mr Petre Roman, the prime minister, liberalised this year as part of his strat- egy to make Romania a mar- ket economy and ditch four decades of Communist-style centralism. The miners are notorious for violence but had once firmly backed the ruling National Salvation Front. In June last year they flocked to Bucharest and mercilessly beat up anti- government demonstrators to save the government from what they called a \"fascist coup\" attempt.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawklns in Paris and Bernard Simon in Toronto CANADA HAS warned the European Commission that de Havilland, the Toronto-based aircraft maker, will collapse if Brussels blocks a Franco-Italian bid for it. The warning, delivered by senior government officials during a visit to Canada by Sir Leon Brittan, European competition commissioner, coincides with Sir Leon's announcement that he opposes the takeover by Adrospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Sir Leon fears the deal would create a near monopoly of the EC market for small commuter aircraft. Canadian officials in Brussels have also approached the Commission with their anxieties. There is no alternative bidder for de Havilland, which is the largest industrial employer in Toronto, with 4,300 employees, and which carries symbolic importance as a guardian of Canadian aerospace technology, said officials. Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport equipment group, considered joining the Franco-Italian bid in June, but was unable to reach agreement with its prospective partners. Canadian diplomats also question whether the EC has a right to apply its anti-trust laws to a non-European country, a sensitive point which recalls similar wrangles over the cross-border scope of competition law between the Canadian government and US anti-trust authorities. The Canadian government turned down the Franco-Italian offer last June, on the grounds that the partners wanted too much state aid and that they were suspected of wanting to reduce de Havilland to a components supplier. Since then, the European consortium has tabled new proposals, which the government is likely to accept, say Canadian diplomats. Adrospatiale was still awaiting a decision from Investment Canada, the government's foreign investment watchdog, said a spokesman for the French aircraft group.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugo Dixon WHATEVER EC politicians decide at the Maastricht sum- mit in December, Britons have already voted for Europe - with their telephones. The UK spends 2bn telephone minutes speaking to other European Community countries every year - the same as France, not much behind Germany's 2.4bn minutes and almost double Italy's l.lbn. While the Franco-German axis is the EC's stron- gest - generating 480m min- utes of telephone traffic in 1989 - the Anglo-German and Anglo-French axes are coming along strongly, generating 430m and 410m minutes each. Britain spoke to the US for l.lbn minutes, while Germany spoke for 700m, France for 360m and Italy for just 240m. But only 21 per cent of UK traffic is with the US against 43 per cent with the EC. There may be no better mea- sure of links between nations than how often they speak. Such traffic flows are detailed in a report* published yester- day by the London-based Inter- national Institute of Communi- cations. The report reveals: * Luxembourg makes more international calls than India, which has 2,000 times the pop- ulation. * Hong Kong, gearing up for the 1997 handover of power from Britain to China, speaks to its new master for 410m minutes a year, about seven times as much as to the UK. * Canada, with less than half the population of Germany, France or the UK, speaks to the US for 2.7bn minutes a year - more than any of the large European nations speak to the rest of the Community. * Italy is particularly badly served by crippling charges. It speaks to other Community nations less than the Nether- lands does, even though it has four times the population. * Japan remains insular, in spite of aggressive moves by Japanese companies into inter- national markets in the 1980s. Its 870m minutes of outgoing calls compare to Switzerland's 1.4bn. * The total volume of interna- tional traffic, estimated at 35bn minutes in 1991, will double to 60bn-70bn in 1995. *The Global Telecommunica- tions T'rffic Report 1991, ITC, Taiotstock House South, Tavis- tock Square, London WCIH WLF T1Pl m71 3a-71 Â£\"5Al ru, ~r ~ vv ~~ u",

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent AN URGENT call for a common European Community policy on exports of arms and dual-use technologies is made in a report published today. The UK-based Saferworld Foundation, an independent think tank and pressure group, warns that despite pro- posals for tighter controls in the wake of the Gulf war \"the past few months have wit- nessed the beginnings of a renewed arms race in the Mid- dle East region and beyond\". It questions the commitment of big exporters such as Britain and France to over- coming the obstacles in the way of an effective interna- tional regime. The report underlines differ- ences in the regulatory guide- lines applied by EC countries, with variances in products and countries subject to control as well as in the enforcement of \"end-user\" certificates, designed to prevent re-export. It warns that completion of the single European market will enable goods and technol- ogies to pass free of controls to the member countries with the least stringent policies and be exported from there to \"unde- sirable\" destinations. \"Unless all EC states har- monise their controls over arms exports at a high enough level, inconsistencies and weak links will undermine the present system of national control, which itself is often inadequate,\" it says. The EC should define groups of client countries to which different export rules would apply.

The proposed move would complete Brussels' drive to break down national protec- tionism by opening up public procurement to competitive tender, chiefly through adver- tisements placed in the EC's Official Journal. The Commission estimates at Ecul45bn (:102bn) the value of services which all public bodies, or private com- panies enjoying special rights, bought in the EC last year. But the Commission is pro- posing exceptions to the ser- vices directive, which comple- ments one agreed last year on supplies and equipment in the the four sectors concerned. Cross-border tendering would only be required for telecom- munications service contracts above the value of Ecu600,000, with an Ecu400,000 threshold for the three other sectors.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "l N OCTOBER 6, Portuguese vot- ers go to the polls in a general \\ e flection that will decide how the country faces the challenge of having its markets opened up fully to interna- tional competition under European Community rules. The choice for voters is essentially between two very different styles of government. They can choose either a continuation of the current social demo- cratic (PSD) administration dominated by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, with its emphasis on liberal market economics and private enter- prise, or the softer socialist alternative which promises greater state participa. tion and more resources to reduce inequalities. The 20-day election campaign has become increasingly fierce and person- alised. Claims and counter-claims have flown between the parties as the rheto- ric of the campaign has sharpened. The immediate effect has been to polarise opinion between the right-of- centre social democrats and the social- ist (PS) opposition, leaving the smaller parties fighting for survival. Mr Cavaco Silva has warned the country faces chaos unless he is re-elected. He says Portugal cannot afford the instability of a minority government. The opposition says that Mr Cavaco Silva is seeking ever more power and is secretly preparing a tough austerity plan, will raise taxes and reduce pen- sions benefits. Mr Cavaco Silva, who runs his party and government firmly from the top, dismisses these attacks and points to his government's achievements. He says Portugal has enjoyed A Cavaco Silva: clear majority Europe's highest growth rates for the past four years and its lowest unem- ployment rate. Standards of living have risen, the country has been modernised and the economy liberalised to encour- age private enterprise. Pottugal is \"on the right road\" towards bridging the gap with its richer European partners, the prime minister says. The economy has grown by an aver- age 4.5 per cent since 1987, with nearly full employment. Mr Cavaco Silva can claim credit for providing a propitious economic environment although much of the improvement is because of Portu- gal's 1986 entry into the EC and receipt of substantial EC aid. Mr Jorge Sampalo, the socialist leader, counters that social inequalities have worsened. Portugal's new middle classes have enjoyed the economic boom with rising living standards but many people, particularly in the regions, are worse off, he says. The opposition also charges that health and education have been undermined by lack of resources, and that housing is in crisis. Portugal's economy has experi- enced \"growth without quality\", and traditional sectors such as textiles and agriculture are unprepared for the chal- lenge of European integration. With characteristic self-confidence, Mr Cavaco Silva has pinned his and his party's future on winning another abso- lute majority, He says he will not head another gov- ernment unless he wins a \"clear\" majority which he defines as half the deputies in the assembly plus one, requiring around 44 per cent of the vote. He says he will take his party into opposition rather than lead a minority or coalition government. In the 1987 election, called after Mr Cavaco Silva's 18-month minority gov- ernment lost a censure motion, the PSD won 50.2 per cent of the vote and 148 assembly seats out of 250. It was the first time a party had won an overall parliamentary majority since the 1974 revolution. The socialists trailed with 22.2 per cent of the vote and 60 seats. Opinion polls - which tend to under- estimate the opposition's strength - point to a easy win for the ruling party, but the opposition could deny Mr Cavaco Silva his clear majority. The socialists have improved their standing since the last election. Mr Sampaio did well in local voting in 1989. and has strengthened what was a weak and fractured party. Recent polls give the socialists about 37 per cent of the vote. But Mr Sampaio has found it hard to fight back against the incumbent who has the full government and PSD propaganda machines behind him and who finds help in many sectors of the media including state-owned television. The opposition leader says minority governments need not be unstable, and he is prepared to lead one if necessary. Mr Diogo Freitas do Amaral, leader of the small conservative CDS party, favours a coalition to force the govern- ment to take account of a broader range of opinion. The CDS, which has close ties to the church, has seen its popular- ity decline sharply in the 1980s. The party hopes to win the votes of those on the right who say they are unhappy with Mr Cavaco Silva. A question mark also hangs over the future of the hard-line communist party (PCP), though it has been more resilient than its critics may have hoped. Its share of the vote has declined from 18 per cent in 1983 and 12.2 per cent in the last election. It retains orthodox Marxist views, though the leadership's initial support for the Soviet coup caused an unusually public outburst of criticism from reformers. The issue was pushed aside once the campaign started. It could win about 8 per cent of the votes according to the polls. The PCP wants an alliance with the socialist party but Mr Sampaio rejects the idea, calling on communist supporters to vote for the socialists as the only way to defeat the ruling party.",

The letter was delivered by Mr Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's delegate to the UN, in response to an earlier request by the Security Council for the release of the 44 inspectors. Yesterday the inspectors remained in a Baghdad court- yard for a second day with Iraqi officials refusing to let them move unless they handed back videotapes and docu- ments found in a search for Iraq's nuclear secrets. The inspectors say docu- ments they took from the building are the \"administra- tive structure of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme\". Iraq says they are personal files on employees. Mr Merimde said: \"It could be a breakthrough. We hope it will be a breakthrough, but we have to study it more carefully. The first impression is a good one.\" In the letter Iraq offered to release the inspectors if they signed for each document. Baghdad also invited a senior UN official for further negotia- tions. Sir David Hannay, British delegate at the UN, said that, based upon the Iraqi letter, \"it appears as if a settlement has been reached on release of the UN inspectors\". Iraq had accused the inspec- United Nations inspectors decontaminating each other after inspecting mustard gas shells in Iraq earlier this month tors of exceeding their author- ity and has also claimed that the leading American in the team is a CIA spy - a charge denied by the UN. Yesterday's developments came as the Pentagon des- patched 96 Patriot missiles and the first of 1,200 US Army troops from Germany to Saudi Arabia to operate them. US President George Bush announced last week he would provide the Saudis with the missiles for defence. While the stand-off in Bagh- dad continued, UN officials expressed some satisfaction that Iraq seemed to have caved in on UN demands to allow unconditional flying rights for its helicopters searching for Baghdad's unconventional weapons programme. White House spokesman Mr Marlin Fitzwater said that Iraq's written assurances on flying rights appeared to have removed the need for military protection of the surveillance helicopters. He noted, however, that Iraq had violated previous ceasefire commitments and said the US was keeping its options open.",

   "text_content" : "FOREIGN troops restored calm to Zaire's capital Kinshasa yesterday after two days of riots and looting killed at least 30 peo- ple, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. France and former colonial ruler Bel- gium flew in hundreds of troops to protect their nationals, whose homes and busi- nesses were stripped by mobs led by muti- nous soldiers angered at not receiving a pay rise. President Mobuto Sese Seko, target of widespread protests, called the riots the worst in the country's history and the government clamped an overnight curfew on the city. French and Belgian officials strongly rejected criticism that they had intervened to prop up the administration of Mr Mob- utu, Zaire's autocratic pro-western leader. Belgian commandos began ferrying Bel- gium nationals out of Zaire across the A total of 49 people have been killed and hostages, including civilians, seized in an army mutiny in northern Chad, according to state-run radio, Reu- ter reports from Ndjamena. The government of the central Afri- can country blamed the violence on troops loyal to ex-president Hissene Habre, who was ousted last December by a rival military force. Zaire river and the French Foreign Minis- try said some troops were being sent to protect foreigners in the copper-rich Shaba province in the south. In Washington, the US announced that it would provide transport for the French troops in Zaire and for the protection and safe evacuation of Americans. But the Pentagon said the airlift did not \"consti- tute an involvement in the internal affairs of Zaire\". Israel evacuated about 100 businessmen and diplomats' families, while Portugal said it was sending a small military con- tingent to assist in evacuating Portuguese nationals, who comprise one of the largest foreign communities in Zaire. Mr Mobutu said on Tuesday night the riots had been instigated by \"seditious tracts\" circulated among troops and he called on soldiers to return to barracks. However, Zairean opposition groups said the violence arose from frustration at the slow pace of a national conference which was supposed to introduce democratic reforms, but has been deadlocked since it opened on August 7. Mr Mobutu said he had called a cabinet meeting and officials were expecting him to introduce changes in the government.",

The move sparked turmoil in financial markets, with inter- est rates tumbling, the stock market rising sharply, and the dollar easing by a cent to 57.4 cents against the US dollar. The NZSE-40 index rose 26.21, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,400.18. Dr Don Brash, the central bank governor, announced from New York that he was easing monetary conditions because evidence had mounted over the last two months that inflation was falling faster than the bank had expected in its August forecasts. It now believed that inflation could fall to 2 per cent this year. The announcement was seized on by the markets as the long-awaited response to the tough August budget. The hectic day's trading was further encouraged by political developments, in particular the meeting in New York between Mr Jim Bolger, the prime min- ister, and US President George Bush, which it is hoped will ease New Zealand's trading dif- ficulties with the US."

   "text_content" : "By David Housego in New Delhi INDIA'S Congress administration yesterday announced plans to reserve almost 60 per cent of central government jobs for those from lower caste and poor families. The measures extend job reservation in central govern- ment to include the so-called \"backward castes\" (farmers and artisans) and to poor fami- lies from the upper castes. Currently 27 per cent of jobs in central government are reserved for \"untouchables\" and students from tribal fami- lies in an effort to compensate for the disadvantages of birth. Similar proposals last year by the then government of Mr V.P. Singh provoked wide- spread rioting and violence across north India by upper caste students fearful at the loss of job opportunities. The upper castes have traditionally dominated the civil service which provides opportunities for patronage and for taking bribes. Mr P.V.Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, hopes to have avoided this by consultation with other political parties and by providing a quota of Jobs for poor upper caste fami- lies. The new measure - unlike Mr Singh's - will require backward caste stu- dents to demonstrate low income before they are eligible for a reserved post. The government's compro- mise formula is none the less a populist measure that runs counter to the market-oriented philosophy that has governed Its recent economic reforms. Senior officials yesterday sought to water down the impact by saying the measures would take a long time to Implement. In addition, cuts in government expenditure to prune the fiscal deficit mean there will be fewer vacancies in the civil service. The timing of the measure has been determined largely by the Supreme Court which is considering whether Job reser- vation above 80 per cent In central government violates the constitution. The court asked the government what level of reservatinm it sought. In proposing -m icrease to S. per eamt the goveument hopes to reap benlIt tn key by-elections next month.

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem and Our Middle East Staff ISRAEL yesterday accused Iran of failing to meet its com- mitments in the Lebanese hos- tage negotiations, and said it would not free any more Leb- anese prisoners without fur- ther information on Israeli ser- vicemen missing in Lebanon. The Israeli statement under- lined the obstacles still in the way of a final settlement of the hostage issue, despite the release on Tuesday night of Mr Jack Mann, a British captive, and Iranian predictions that a US hostage would also be freed soon. Freedom for some 300 Israeli- held prisoners, including Sheikh Abdul-Karim Karim Obeid, a radical Shia Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli forces two years ago, is the key demand made by Islamic fun- damentalist groups holding the remaining Western hostages. The Israeli Defence Ministry said it was ready to continue to co-operate with Mr Javier Pdrez de Cudllar, the UN secre- tary-general, to secure a solu- tion to the hostage problem. Israel is holding out for fur- ther information on the fate of air force navigator Ron Arad, one of five Israeli servicemen still unaccounted for in Leba- non. Israel believes Mr Arad, known to have been captured alive, to have been at one stage in Iranian hands. Mr Danny Naveh, a defence ministry spokesman, said Iran had failed to live up to commit- ments given under Mr Perez de Cuellar's hostage plan to pro- vide clear information on Mr Arad. He said Israel also wanted definitive word on the fate of Private Yossi Fink, a British- born soldier missing since 1986, before making another move. Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's chief negotiator, said Sheikh Obeid would be among the last to be freed. \"It is clear that we will not contribute our share as long as our direct interests regarding our prisoners are not satisfied.\" Mr Mann, the 77-year-old retired British pilot freed on Tuesday by Lebanese kidnap- pers, arrived in Britain yester- lay to be greeted by a Second World War Spitfire performing t victory roll. Mr Mann, who flew Spitfires n the Battle of Britain, saluted he aircraft at the Royal Air Force base in Lyneham, and lis wife Sunnie told a welcom- ng crowd: \"It's the most won- lerful day of my life\". Squadron Leader Garth Man- ling, the chief medical officer iboard the Manns' RAF flight rom Damascus, said Mr Mann was in \"remarkably good shape when you consider he has been n a cell for 2% years\". Mr John Major, the British Ã½rime minister, spoke of his lelight at Mr Mann's release md said efforts would continue to win the freedom of Mr Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Can- terbury's envoy who is the last remaining British hostage. Mr Major has sent messages :o the governments of Iran, Syria, Israel and Lebanon and to Mr Pdrez de Cullar, thank- ing them for their help in sec- uring Mr Mann's release and expressing that hope that other 2ostages will be freed.",

F Next month's meeting in r Harare of Commonwealth r prime ministers is due to dis- a cuss an \"appraisal\" of the r organisation's future role by a group of 10 heads of govern- C ment. t Chief Anyaoku clearly indi- d cated that he did not want the South African problem to dom- inate the talks. The virulent battles between Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, and the other heads of govern- ment, dominated the last few summits to such an extent that the Commonwealth looked like becoming a one-issue forum. The secretary-general sin- gled out four main areas where the association could become a much more effective instru- ment than it had been in the past: political dialogue, eco- nomic development, the pro- motion of \"good governance\" and human resource develop- ment. The really new element in Chief Anyaoku's proposals was the emphasis on promoting democracy, good government and human rights which he said were \"central to Common- wealth principles\". The changed international environment favoured stronger action in this field, of which the international intervention to provide a \"safe haven\" for the Kurds in Iraq was a good example. \"You could get to the point where the international com- munity could interfere in the internal affairs of a country on the basis of consensus.\" Having established that the problem of South Africa was no more than one of several important issues to be dealt with in Harare, Chief Anyaoku nevertheless emphasised that \"sanctions pressure would con- tinue to be necessary for ensur- ing a successful final outcome in South Africa.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Mauthner PRESIDENT Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola yesterday addressed an urgent appeal to the west, and Britain in partic- ular, to help his country over- come its post-civil war eco- nomic crisis. After urging British industri- alists on Tuesday to participate in Angola's reconstruction pro- gramme, the president gave another pledge yesterday that foreign businessmen would be offered favourable incentives for investments. The ending of the civil war with a peace agreement in the early summer, combined with the implementation of a mar- ket economy and an economic stabilisation programme, should be seen as an irrevers- ible process, he told members of the Royal Institute of Inter- national Affairs in London. Both in his speeches during a two-day visit to Britain and in an interview with the Sinan- cial Times, Mr dos Santos out- lined the kind of advantages which foreign investors could expect to find in Angola. A new foreign investment law provided for the repatria- tion of profits and dividends, guarantees for the property of investors and a number of tax exemption or tax reduction measures. The government's economic reform programme included, in particular, the lib- eralisation of prices, the pro- motion and privatisation of small and medium-sized com- panies, the restructuring and decentralisation of the banking system and the creation of new banks with foreign capital. PFiority was being given to rationalising administrative services and streamlining the dos Santos in Street on state enterprise sector. The areas in which the authorities would particularly welcome foreign participation included the oil industry, where British Petroleum was already active, agriculture, transport, the power and water industries and large infrastruc- ture projects in general. In talks on Tuesday with Mr John Major, the UK prime min- ister, the president made a spe- cial appeal to Britain and west- ern industrialised nations in general to facilitate a resched- uling of Angola's mounting for- eign debt. This totalled nearly 96.5bn (Â£3.7bn) last year, only $Sbn less than the country's gross domestic product. A member of the Interna- tional Monetary Fund since 1989, Angola is aware that any decision by international banks and the Paris Club of creditor nations to reschedule its debt is dependent on IMF approval of its economic stabi- lisation plan. A mission from the Fund is currently reported to be in Angola for discussions on the plan with the country's authorities. The president refused to be drawn very far on the political situation in his country, other than to stress that next year's elections would be \"free and fair\" and would be monitored by international observers. However, it had not yet been decided whether parliamentary and presidential elections would be held simultaneously or separately.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE US Senate has passed a bill to extend benefits for the unemployed, setting the scene for a battle of wills with Presi- dent George Bush. Mr Bush has promised to veto the $6bn (Â£3.4bn) measure, arguing it would represent an expensive and ineffective breach of budget discipline. The bill passed the Senate and the House of Representa- tives with a majority of more than two thirds. This is enough for the Democrat-dominated Congress to inflict its first big defeat on Mr Bush by overrid- ing his veto, unless the presi- dent can win rebel Republican senators back to his side. The bill is similar to a mea- sure sent to Mr Bush in August, which would have extended unemployment bene- fits by between seven and 20 weeks beyond the standard 26 weeks, depending on the rate of unemployment in each state. Democrats have used a study by the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington policy group, to argue that, although unem- ployment now appears to have stabilised at about 6.8 per cent, 1.8m people exhausted their benefit entitlement in the first seven months of this year. Last August the president signed the bill but refused to make the declaration of enier- gency needed to bring it into effect. The new Senate bill would allow Mr Bush to use the same tactic, but the House version would automatically declare the emergency. If this version prevails in a Senate-House con- ference, some of the 13 Repub- lican Senators who backed the bill this week may reverse their votes. But the Democrats have already won one round in the battle. In August the adminis- tration argued the recession was over, so the extension of benefits was not needed; this time it implicitly acknowl- edged the continuation of the recession's effects by backing a more limited proposal by Sen- ate Republican leader Robert Dole to extend benefits by 10 weeks. * New orders for durable goods fell 3.8 per cent last month, partially -reversing a large gain in July, the Com- merce Department said yester- day, writes Michael Prowse. Separate figures showed a 2.1 per cent decline in sales of existing homes, further evi- dence that the weak housing recovery is losing momentum.",

The banks have been broadly favourable to a Brazil- ian proposal, made on August 21, which based restructuring on the creation of Brady bonds - as used in the case of Mexico and Venezuela.

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in New York __ MR Kemal SShosib - a Sformer Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) execu- tive accused of acting as a front man in the US - has been fined $20m (Â£11.4m) by the Federal Reserve. The action comes a week after the Fed unveiled a $37m fine against Mr Gaith Phar- aon, a Saudi Arabian sinan- cier, who had been accused of violating US banking laws by acting as a covert agent for BCCI in the illegal purchase of Independence Bank in Calif- ornia. Mr Shoaib, who served as chairman of Independence Bank, was accused of \"per- sonal dishonesty\" in last week's action. Yesterday the Fed said Mr Shoaib participated in the illegal acquisition of Independence Bank by, among other things, identifying the bank for purchase by BCCI and thereafter seeking BCCI's approval over the staffing and appointments to the board. In Los Angeles, a district court froze Mr Shoalb's assets. Mr Shoaib was a personal pro- togd of Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, the founder of BCCI who has been charged with fraud by US authorities. The Fed fined BCCI $200m last July. Investigators in the US are meanwhile examining whether Mr Shoaib had any ties to Mr Clark Clifford, the former chairman of First American Bankshares and also former lawyer to BCCI who has insisted he knew nothing of BCCI's secret control of US banks. Mr Clifford told a congres- sional panel earlier this month he had been deceived and never knew that BCCI main- tained secret control of First American through a series of front men who operated the way Mr Pharaon did at Inde- pendence Bank.",

   "text_content" : "Constitutional change could be jeopardised by trade deregulation, writes Bernard Simon \" jR Brian Mulroney, M | the prime binister. J.Y hais'thrown abihgi y inflamwable ingredient - a bid to unify tradet aid eco- nomic policy - into the long- running debate over whether francophone Quebec should emain part of the Canadian family. Most of the 28 points in Mr Mulroney's latest constitu-, tional blueprint, tabled in the House of Commons on Tues- day, seek to address either Quebec's concern that it be given adequate powers to pro- tect its French character, or to allay the fears of the other nine provinces that Quebec's gain will not be their loss. Ottawa proposes to meet the concerns by transferring a raft of extra responsibilities to the provinces. By dint of being recognised as a distinct soci- ety, Quebec will, for example, have greater control over immigration and cultural pro- grammes. Other provinces wanting similar powers will get them, and more. Aboriginal people, who have Trown into a political force to be reckoned with over the past few years, will be given some form of self-government within the next 10 years. But as a counterweight to the growing clout -of the prov- inces and other interest groups, the government has suggested a sweeping deregula- tion of trade and economic pol- icies. The liberalisation, i4 it comes to fruition, would be as significant for Canada as 1992 is for members of the Euro- pean Community. Under the Mulroney plan, players: (from left) art Bourassa. Joe parliament would be empow- ered to dismantle specific inter-provincial trade barriers, provided it has the agreement of any seven provinces repre- senting 50 per cent of the popu- lation. New curbs on the move- ment of goods, services, people or capital would be outlawed from July 1995. Any province opposed to free trade would be allowed breath- ing space of up to three years, but then only with the approval of 60 per cent of the members of its own legislature. The plan for a more close-knit economic union tackles what many consider a key reason for Canada's poor record over the past decade in the international productivity and competitiveness league. The federal government has estimated the provinces have erected about 500 non-tariff barriers, which in many cases are more restrictive than those which apply to imports from foreign countries. For instance, while people in Ontario can buy French and California wines, government- owned liquor stores do not stock wines from British Columbia. Doctors, lawyers and even trucks cannot move from one province to another without a cumbersome licen- sing procedure. All provinces grant generous tender prefer- ences to suppliers within their borders. Within hours of the constitu- tional plan being published on Tuesday it was clear the eco- nomic proposals will be just as divisive as the political blue- print, if not more so; any move to lower inter-provincial trade barriers are bound to upset hundreds of special interest groups throughout the coun- try. Mr Luien Bouchard, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebe cois, complained that economic decisions could be taken out of Quebec's hands if Ottawa and the other provinces decided the francophone province's policies were not in their interests. \"Not even Pierre Trudeau [who was reviled among Quebec nationalists] would have dared do this,\" Mr Bouchard said. On the political front, Que bec nationalists have been quick to criticise the latest package for giving insufficient weight to the recognition of Quebec as a \"distinct society.\" Ominously, the early critics have included some members of Quebec's ruling Liberal party. The Liberal leader and provincial premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, was due to spell out his initial reaction late yester- day to Ottawa's proposals. Mr Bourassa, who has one of the most sensitive political noses in the country, will be careful not to reject the plans. But with both his party and the province at large appar- ently divided, he is unlikely to withdraw the threat of an inde- pendence referendum, due to be held by October 1992. For the next five months, Canadians both in and outside Quebec will be absorbed in dis- secting the package. A large parliamentary committee will travel around the country hold- ing public hearings, from which the government hopes a broad consensus will emerge. The risk is that a tug at any one part of the carefully crafted package will unravel other parts. Pleas and com- plaints fromn special interest groups could drown out the desire of most Canadians to put the arcane business of writing a constitution and the wrangling over Quebec's role in the federation behind them. Unlike the Meech Lake accord; which required unani- mous' ratification by the prov- inces, the latest measures need to be approved by only seven provinces, again representing / at least 50 per cent of the popu- lation. But the government is gird- ing itself to bring the long-run- ning constitutional debate to a more decisive end. Mr Joe Clark, the constitutional affairs minister, announced this week that he would table legislation within the next few months empowering the gov- ernment to hold the first national referendum since a vote in 1942 on cons- cription.",

   "text_content" : "By John Barham in Buenos Aires BRITAIN and Argentina took another important step towards normalisation of relations yesterday when diplomats signed new accords substantially reduc- ing military restrictions imposed by Britain in the South Atlantic after the 1982 Falklands conflict. The ceremony took place in advance of today's meeting between Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and Mr Guido di Tella, his Argentine coun- terpart, at the UN in New York. They will discuss issues such as oil explora- tion around the islands, control of the region's substantial fish stocks and British investments in Argentina's ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Juan Carlos Olima, Argentine assistant foreign minister, said the accords \"are a product of the increase in reciprocal confidence in military matters. They are a substantial advance in normalising relations with Great Britain.\" The two countries resumed full diplomatic relations a year ago. A British diplomat stressed that nearly all air and sea movements were now subject to standard international accords. He added the agreement was further recognition that \"relations with Argentina are improving and that the behaviour of Argentina's military is also improving\". Under the accords, both countries' navies and air forces must notify each other in writing 14 days in advance of large military manoeuvres within 80 miles of the coasts of Argentina or the Falkland Islands and other British pos- sessions in the South Atlantic. Only 48 hours' notice is required for combat vessels approaching within 15 miles of the coast. Such approaches will be agreed by mutual accord. Previously, 25 days' notice was needed for a broader definition of mili- tary activity over a vast area of the South Atlantic. Furthermore, all navy ships had to give 48 hours' notice before coming within 50 miles of the Islands. Military aircraft could not come within 70 miles without prior notification. Despite its defeat in the war, Argen- tina continues to claim sovereignty over the islands. Mr Olima said the accord in no way recognised British sovereignty over the Falklands and added Argentina would continue to push for a reduction in Britain's mili- tary presence there. Also yesterday, Argentina and Britain agreed regular flights between Buenos Aires and Port Stanley by a Uruguayan airline for the first time since the war. The Falkland Islands immigration department, however, refuses to issue visas to Argentine citi- zens.",

   "text_content" : "EUROPEAN Commission estimates made last year that Japanese vehicle producers' share of the UK car and light commercial vehicle market cduld jump to 29 per cent and that their share of the French and Italian markets could more than triple by 1999, underlie the recent understanding reached by Brussels and the Japanese Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry on Japanese car sales in the single European market. The deal announced at the end of July contained no mar- ket share forecasts, unlike the calculations made by the Com- mission a year ago in an ear- lier stage of the protracted negotiations (see table). At the end of July the Com- mission conceded publicly to Japan - and to the UK govern- ment - that there would be no limit on Japanese investment in the EC and that there would be \"free circulation\" in the EC for Japanese vehicles built in Europe, which effectively ruled out the setting of any formal limits on Japanese market shares. The July deal entitled \"Ele- ments of Consensus\" contained an assumption for the growth of the EC car and light com- mercial vehicle market to 15.1m in 1999 from 13.95m in 1989, which is unchanged, how- ever, from the earlier forecasts produced in August 1990, except that the forecast period has been extended by a year from 1998. When the original forecast with market shares was leaked a year ago it was denounced by Mrs Edith Cresson, now the French prime minister, but then French minister for Euro- pean affairs, on the grounds that all future growth in the EC car market had been ceded to Japanese producers. While Kevin Done analyses estimates of the Japanese share of Europe's market the forecast for the overall market has been left unchanged from the Commis- sion's earlier forecast, Brussels did succeed in the July deal - with explicit Japanese agree- ment - in reducing its forecast for the level of Japanese exports in 1999 by 90,000 vehicles to 1.23m from the 1.32m assumed a year ago for 1998. It has also reduced its figure for sales by the Japanese trans- plants (local assembly plants) in Europe to 1.2m from the ear- lier level of 1.5m, although this is its own internal \"working assumption\", that has not been accepted explicitly by the Japa- nese side. It has also declared its own aim that EC producers should benefit from one third of the growth of the market from its 1990 level. The effect is that the overall Japanese share of the EC car and light commercial vehicle market \"assumed\" by the Com- mission has been reduced to 16.1 per cent in 1999 in the July understanding from the range of 17.5-18.7 per cent in 1998 indicated at the earlier stage of the negotiations last year. The Japanese share was 9.4 per cent in 1989. Significantly, however, the figure agreed for Japanese direct vehicle exports to the UK in 1999 has been margin- ally increased to 190,000 in the July understanding from the earlier forecast.

   "text_content" : "By Andr6w Baxter THE UK ENGINEERING industry is close to the bottom of the recession, but a slow, steady recovery is unlikely to start until the second quarter of next year, the Engineer- ing Employers' Federation said yes- terday. The federation's autumn Engineer- ing Economic Trends report, pub- lished yesterday, predicts that a fur- ther 90,000 jobs will go over the next 12 months, on top of the 150,000 lost in the past year. That would reduce engineering employment to 1.84m, against 3m in 1980. The report, which is broadly con- sistent with the Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of monthly trends, warns of the long-term effects of the recession and reduced fixed investment in the economy. Sustained growth beyond 1992 will depend on an increase in manufacturing capacity, it says. The federaon pointed to two sig- nificant underlying economic trends affecting the industry. First, since April 1990, the pound's rise rel- ative to the Ecu pushed costs up much faster than prices, indicating pressure on export profit margins. 1 Second, the federation takes issue t with forecasts frbm the Organisation a for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on reductions r in fixed investment in the UK econ- a omy for this yea and next. The fed- a eration predictsUdeclines of 13 per d cent and 6 per cent respectively, against the OECO's 9 per cent and 1 e per cent. r The federation believes the engi- t neering industry will face one more e quarter of declining output, mark time in the first buarter of 1992 and si begin an upturn in the second quar- ter. Output growthWwill begin slowly and accelerate later next year. The UK market, though, will remain at a low level next year, albeit higher than this year. Exports are forecast to grow faster than domestic sales. Even so, the federation believes engineering imports will begin to rise faster than exports from around the middle of next year, as the UK economy recovers. The federation noted that the per- formance of engineering exports, r- which began to rise sharply in the y second quarter of this year, had been the principal reason for the reduced L seiverity of the current recession r, compared with that of 1979. Over a that period, engineering exports fell n by 9 per cent, against 3 per ceit to 4 per cent over a comparable period S this time. o Overall, engineering output vol- d ume has fallen some 9 per cent K between the first half of 1990 and the second half of 1991. It is forecast to r- rise 2 per cent between the second 3, halves of 1991 and 1992. The federa- tion predicts a 1.5 per cent rise in engineering sales, at constant pur- chasing power, between the first half of 1991 and the second half of 1992. The previous 18 months saw an 11.3 per cent decline. On the same basis, electronics and computers are forecast to recover most strongly with a 5.2 per cent rise, and only mechanical engineer- ing is forecast to decline further - by 1.3 per cent.

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent MR DAVE NELLIST, the hard-left Labour MP accused of links with Militant, last night refused to rule out contesting his Coventry South-East seat against the party, after his membership was suspended by the national executive commit- tee. The NEC's unprecedented decision also applied to Mr Terry Fields, the Liverpool Broadgreen MP also charged with Militant links. Both are no longer entitled to hold party office or to sit as MPs under the Labour whip, pending the conclusion of an inquiry by the party's disci- plinary body, the national con- stitutional committee. Labour officials would not prejudge the case amid fears of legal actions, but few doubt that the final verdict, expected within a few weeks, will be the expulsion of both men from the party. The three-hour NEC meet- ing, condemned as a \"political mugging\" by Mr Nellist, also ruled that neither man may attend the party's annual con- ference in Brighton next week - an order that the Coventry MP pledged to defy. The Labour leadership's tough action is part of its aim to kill off Tory claims that it remains infiltrated by Trotsky- ites and extremists. About 200 activists, many with Militant links, are under investigation. But protests and emergency resolutions are almost certain to come from leftwing unions and supporters of the rebels at the Brighton conference, which is widely billed as a pre-election unity rally. Questioned after a two-hour meeting with the NEC, Mr Nellist would not be drawn last night on whether he would fight the seat against an imposed official Labour candi- date. \"I rule nothing in or nothing out,\" he said. He went on to claim that the Labour leadership had ignored his defence that he had not breached party rules over Mili- tant connections. Mr Fields, who is on holiday after serving a 60-day sentence for refusing to pay his poll tax, did not attend the meeting.",

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, said yesterday that he favours fixed terms for parliament to end damaging speculation in the run-up to a general election. His comments followed a similar statement by Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the party, earlier this month. The two men's comments make it likely that, if elected prime minister, Mr Kinnock would introduce the necessary legislation in his first term of office. At the moment a prime min- ister can call an election at any time up to five years after the last one. Mr Kinnock said in a party political broadcast shown last night: \"Speculation about the election doesn't do the econ- omy any good because there is a certain instability in the political environment.\" Officially, Labour has no pol- icy on fiXed-term parliaments and the issue is not on the agenda for its annual confer- ence next week. The clear com- mitments expressed by Mr Kin- nock and Mr Hattersley are likely,however, to carry consid- erable weight in the party. Labour says ministers are manipulating the timing of announcements for political advantage. It argues that the power of prime ministers to decide when to go to the coun- try has not been an issue for a decade because Mrs Margaret Thatcher always went well before the full five years allowed. Mr Kinnock said that if a government were defeated in the course of a parliament - presumably on a No Confi- dence vote - there would have to be another election. Fixed terms, however, would, \"take elections out of the manipulative hands of min- isters - any ministers - and put the power of election fully where it should be, in the hands of the people.\"",

Labour would seek to improve crime prevention, increase the number of police, and re-draw sentencing policy so less was spent on keeping people in prison. The increase of 700 police officers promised by ministers this year was only the theoreti- cal number to which police authorities were entitled, Mr Sheerman said as he launched a Labour campaign on police staffing levels. \"In reality many police forces will be unable to afford these increases. . . the extra 700 police officers to which ministers refer are the phan- tom bobbies - the Tories' spectral weapon in the war against crime.\" His figures showed that the increase of 700 officers repre- sented a rise of just over % per cent. Meanwhile crime rates were rising by 18 per cent a year, he said. Mr Sheerman added that a Labour government would make increasing force levels an I early priority. The resources Swould come from elsewhere in the Home Office budget.",

   "text_content" : "By Paul Cheeserlght, Midlands Correspondent MIDLANDS business leaders are becoming increasingly wor- ried about the availability of bank finance to provide work- ing capital for companies mov- ing out of recession and to fund a higher level of invest- ment. This became clear at regional council meetings of the East Midlands and West Midlands Confederation of British Industry, held yester- day in Nottingham and Hale- sowen respectively. Mr Geoff Nicholls, vice- chairman of the East Midlands CBI, noted that companies' cash resources had been squeezed, while banks were not in a strong position to expand lending. The govern- ment should reduce the burden on companies of national insurance payments and SCOTLAND will begin moving out of recession in the current quarter but recovery will be slow, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute, the coun- try's principal Independent economic forecasting body, James Buxton writes. In its quarterly bulletin, the institute expects eco- nomic growth to resume no later than in the rest of the UK because Scotland has sus- feredless from the recession, which began there later than in the UK as a whole. In the past, recovery In Scotland has usually lagged behind that in much of the UK. Output is expected to fall Dby 1.5 per cent this year and rise by only 0.9 per cent in 1992, when total UK output is expected to climb by 1.2 per cent. The institute says a decline in capital spending by UK manufacturers and weak investment intentions will cause difficulties for Scottish manufacturers. Some 27 per cent of their output is devoted to makin investment goods, as opposed to 19 per cent tor the UK as a whole. It points out that unem- ployment in Scotland has been rising since November 1990, reaching 9.2 per cent in August It adds that the jobless rate has been rising faster than in the UK as a whole.

Encouraging industrial investment must be a govern- ment priority. \"It is more important to look at this than to rely on a quick-fix recovery based on consumer spending,\" he said. The West Midlands CBI was concerned about the working- capital requirement of small and medium-sized companies. Mr Edward Roberts, regional chairman, said his members had warned that unless these companies were able to respond to an uplift in demand the recession would lengthen, or more imports would be sucked in to the domestic mar- ket. He said there were few expectations of an upturn in the economy before mid-1992. Bankers taking part in the CBI meetings predicted that there would be more bankrupt- cies as the recession eased. The most vulnerable companies would be those that invested heavily in fixed assets between 1986 and 1988 and which now find their debt burdens increas- ingly onerous at a time of squeezed margins. The CBI worries have been corroborated by Walsall Cham- ber of Commerce, which in a survey of businesses has found that 35 per cent of companies listed the improved availability of cash as a factor that would enhance their prospects.",

   "text_content" : "John Hunt reviews the government's achievements Green finger: Michael Heseltine making his point yesterday at the launch of a 200-page report showing the government's record on the environment HERE WAS no lack of electioneering hyperbole yesterday when Mr Michael Heseltine, the environ- ment secretary, launched a glossy 200-page document list- ing the government's \"green\" record since its environmental white paper a year ago. Seated with his junior minis- ters in front of a banner pro- claiming Action on the Envi- ronment, he said it had been a year of achievement in which the government had intro- duced 400 measures to improve the UK environment. Labour issued a counterblast describing the record set out by Mr Heseltine as \"opportu- nity lost - nothing short of a national disgrace\". Lord Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace, called it \"window dressing\". Mr David Gee, director of Friends of the Earth, said it did not show the decisive leadership on the environment which Mr John Major, the prime minis- ter, had promised. Mr Andrew Warren, of the Association for the Conserva- tion of Energy, gave a qualified welcome. He said there had been some progress, particu- larly in the energy-saving pro- grammes introduced in govern- ment departments. He added, however, that although the UK gross national product had fallen in the past year, there had been a 1.6 per cent rise in emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The new document includes 80 pages, each divided into three columns listing the promise made in last year's white paper, action to date and commitments to further action. It is likely to provide the framework for the Conserva- tives' environmental manifesto at the general election. Significantly, the use of so-called free-market \"eco- nomic instruments\", such as taxation and fiscal incentives to encourage environmental improvements, receive no men- tion in the report. The original document had a big section on this and kept the door open to the introduc- tion of a carbon tax on fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. It was made clear yesterday that neither Mr Heseltine nor Mr David Trippier, the environ- ment minister, has any enthu- siasm for a carbon tax. The document does not have a separate chapter on transport although the rise in pollutants from the large increase in motor vehicle use is one of the biggest threats to the environ- ment. Asked if the government still believed in the \"car society\" endorsed by Mrs Thatcher, Mr Trippier said: \"It is entirely a matter for the Department of Transport.\" He said there would be fur- ther meetings between the DoE and the Transport Department, and that 20 per cent of the UK reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions would have to come from the car industry. The report does contain a rebuke for the Transport Department. The original white paper promised to \"civi- lise traffic in towns\" by refus- ing to provide new road capac- ity for car commuting into con- gested areas. There is an omi- nous blank space against this under the \"action to date\" col- umn and a vague commitment to avoid creating such roads. A similar blank space exists for action accomplished by the Department of Energy to carry through its research and devel opment on renewable energy sources such as wind and wave power. But a new research and development programme worth Â£800,000 is expected to be agreed. The government pledges to play a leading role in interna- tional talks towards a frame work convention to curb global warming. This is expected to be agreed at June's Earth Sum mit in Rio de Janeiro. But the document does not mention that the UK has taken the lead in promoting a \"pledge and review\" policy which, say environmentalists, will severely water down the original concept that there should be strict international targets for reducing carbon dioxide. Under \"pledge and review\", governments could announce general programmes for reducing all greenhouse gases without specific targets for carbon dioxide. Also highlighted is the gov- ernment proposal to set up a national environment agency consisting of the Pollution Inspectorate, part of the National Rivers Authority and taking in the waste regulation functions of local authorities. The government is on safer ground in boasting of its Envi- ronmental Protection Act, which introduces integrated pollution control over air, land and water. The provision that industry must use the best available techniques to control pollution is making companies improve standards. Anticipat- ing criticism, Mr Heseltine wryly observed yesterday that the media \"always looks on the downside even when the upside is so much more evi- dent on a large scale\".

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced rational- isation that will reduce staff numbers in its loss-making general insurance division by more than 14 per cent over the next three years. At least 1,000 of the 6,500- 7,000 people now employed will lose their jobs. Many of those affected are clerical workers. All the company's smallest branches - 48 out of 69 offices - will close next year, and the company's head office and main administration will move to Cheltenham. The cuts, which follow recent announcements of redundancies by a number of other insurance companies, were signalled by Eagle Star last month, when it announced a Â£189m pre-tax loss for the first half of 1991. Eagle Star's losses are among the worst to be suffered by any British insurer. The group has been particularly badly hit by its exposure to the mortgage indemnity market. Mr Michael Butt, Eagle Star chairman, said the group had planned to reduce staff num- bers alongside the introduction of new systems designed to boost efficiency. The compa- ny's recent problems had \"accelerated the pace of change\".

   "text_content" : "By Nikki T.alt in New York A DECISION was reached in New York yesterday to bring a new suit against Lloyd's of London, the UK insurance market, on behalf of \"dozens\" of US Names. There are more than 2,000 Names - the individuals whose personal wealth backs the underwriting market - in the US. The US Names commit relatively large amounts of capital to the market, although they make up a fairly small proportion of the total 26,500 Names. The severe losses incurred at Lloyd's have led to a wave of litigation in the US as Names have questioned the extent of their liability. In general, however, these actions have been brought on behalf of single Names. In this case, the action is likely to be broader, although Proskauer, Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, the New York-based law firm which is co-ordinating the legal initiative, stressed that it would not be a \"class action\". It declined to specify precisely how many Names would appear as plaintiffs, but said that the figure would be at least \"dozens\". The complaint will centre on the allegation that Lloyd's breached US securities law when it recruited US citizens as investors. Lloyd's, however, has already argued in response to this challenge that the US courts do not have any juris- diction over disputes between the London insurance market and its Names. It has claimed that an agreement between the institution and investors in 1987 states that English courts should have exclusive jurisdic- tion over any disputes. More than a quarter of Lloyd's premium income comes from the US, and a wave of bad publicity there could be potentially damaging for its future business prospects. The US suit is further bad news for Lloyd's, which last Friday lost a significant round in its legal battle against a group of British Names. Twen- ty-four members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency in the 1980s allege negligence by Lloyd's was responsible for losses of more than Â£5m. The Appeal Court ruled that when the Names' case against Lloyd's resumes in January the courts will be allowed to see evidence which, the Names claim, shows the extent to which Lloyd's was aware of Oakeley Vaughan's dealings."

BT, formerly British Tele- com, is encouraging the 12,000 users of its Micronet service to switch to the US Compuserve network, which has 835,000 subscribers and is thought to be the world's largest such net- work. Micronet will close on October 31. Micronet was established in 1983 to provide a facility run- ning on BT's Prestel computer network through which owners of BBC B or Apple H micro- computers could communicate to share information, computer programs and other data. BT took over total manage- ment of the network from its partners in 1989, but it admit- ted this week that the service was still not making money. Compuserve charges a sub- scription of about Â£1.25 a month and a connection charge of about Â£3.60 an hour.

   "text_content" : "By Us Wood, Labour Staff A PACKAGE of improved maternity leave in the National Health Service was announced yesterday by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, minister for health. She claimed the pro- visions would be among the best in the country. The agreement, which comes into effect this week, gives women 18 weeks' paid and up to 34 weeks' unpaid leave, sub- ject to a year's qualifying ser- vice. Previously, the NHS pro- vision was slightly above the statutory minimum, with six weeks' fully-paid leave and 12 weeks' half-paid leave after a two-year qualifying period. Mrs Bottomley said she was determined that the NHS EMPLOYMENT should be in the vanguard of employment practices for women. \"Although much remains to be done to achieve this, this new agreement is an important step forward,\" she added. The agreement was reached in the General Whitley Coun- cil, the NHS pay negotiating body, in talks between manage- ment and unions. A letter detailing the new provisions has been sent to all health authorities. The NHS is the biggest employer of women in Europe, but its treatment of them has recently been widely criticised. The Equal Opportunities Com- mission published a report in August on women's employ- ment in the NHS, accusing the organisation of paying \"lip ser- vice\" to sex equality and dis- playing \"deeply ingrained dis- crimination\" towards its 1m women workers. In June this year Mr Eric Caines, NHS director of person- nel, wrote to regional general managers after the results of a report commissioned from the Office of Public Management on equal opportunities. The report found evidence that the NHS was still per- ceived by many potential employees as an inflexible employer which did not have \"woman-friendly\" employment practices. Mr Caines urged managers to consider ways of developing employment prac- tices for women. A combination of the need to improve the recruitment and retention of women, skill short- ages and the personal interest of Mrs Bottomley have already provoked some changes within the NHS. These have included career breaks and the encour- agement of health authorities to provide childcare facilities. * More than 7,000 jobs could be lost in the NHS if the sec- ond wave of hospital trusts is established, the TGWU general union claimed yesterday. The TGWU, Britain's largest union, has 45,000 NHS members. Mr Jack Dromey, a national officer of the union, claimed that 3,000 jobs had been lost in the first wave of opt-outs in which 57 hospitals elected for self-governing trust status. The Department of Health said there was no substance to the allegations, adding that informal evidence on staff numbers in trusts was that they were expected to remain more or less stable this year.

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff EMPLOYERS were yesterday urged by the government and the Confederation of British Industry to introduce targets for the employment and pro- motion of women and ethnic minorities. Mr Robert Jackson, employ- ment minister, said that any equal opportunities policy needed a clear action plan to make it an integral part of management practice. \"Setting targets can demon- strate to everyone that the organisation is actively com- mitted to equal opportunities and is transforming this com- mitment into a reality,\" he said at the launch of a CBI report on employment mea- sures to promote equality. The CBI guide came the day after figures released by the Equal Opportunities Commis- sion showed that the gap between male and female earn- ings was significantly wider in the UK than in other EC coun- tries and that women contin- ued to be concentrated in part-time jobs with low status. The Trades Union Congress, reacting to the EOC findings, warned yesterday that the earnings gap would increase further with the spread of per- formance-related pay and indi- vidual contracts. Civil Service unions have already asked the Treasury to investigate why male and female civil servants appear to be receiving differ- ing sums of performance pay. The CBI stressed yesterday that it was not advocating the setting of fixed quotas for appointments. Organisations should set levels of employ- ment and promotion for under- represented groups, but should appoint and promote on the basis of merit. One of the few organisations to have set targets is the BBC. Out of 26,000 employees, 43 per cent are women - but most are doing lower-paid jobs. A target has been set by the corporation of 30 per cent of senior management and 40 per cent of middle manage- ment posts to be filled by women by 1996. Discriminate on Ability.

Most of the pay of the museum's archaeologists was financed by property develop- ers last year, but the subse- quent decline in development has cut the number of archaeo- logical digs. The tribunal said the museum had failed to consult the IPMS civil servants' union, which represented the archae- ologists, within the statutory period of 90 days before the redundancies started. It awarded them up to Â£2,000 each, and the museum said it might appeal. Teacher vacancies down on year TEACHER vacancies are down by a third on last year, but turnover of teachers is continu- ing to rise, according to two surveys published yesterday. A Department of Education survey of most English local education authorities found the number of unfilled vacan- cies this month 32 per cent lower than a year ago. A survey published by the Local Government Manage- ment Board, which advises councils on training and pay, showed that turnover of teach- ers in local-authority schools had risen from 13 per cent in 1989 to 13.1 per cent in 1990. * Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night defended government education reforms after attacks on them by church leaders. He said a new scheme next year would target funds on many disadvantaged areas.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Hughes, Law Courts Correspondent TWO former leading City merchant bankers will stand trial at Southwark Crown Court, London, today in the second stage of the,prosecution aris- ing from the Guinness affair. They are Lord Spens, former direc- tor of corporate finance at Henry Ans- bacher, and Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell. Both are accused of involve- ment in an unlawful share-support operation mounted by Guinness dur- ing its bitterly fought takeover battle with the Argyll supermarket group for Distillers, the Scottish drinks group, in 1986. They are jointly charged with con- spiracy to contravene section 13 of the 1958 Prevention of Fraud (Invest- ments) Act by conspiring to induce Distillers shareholders to exchange their holdings for shares in Guinness by the dishonest concealment of mate- rial facts. Mr Seelig alone faces another charge under the same act and two Theft Act charges of false accounting. Lord Spens is also charged with one false accounting offence. Both men deny all the charges. Mr Justice Henry will preside at the trial, which is expected to last about three months. Mr Seelig will conduct his own defence, having decided last year that he could no longer afford lawyers. Originally both defendants were represented by QCs, junior barristers and solicitors. In April 1989 Lord Spens announced that he could nc longer afford the mounting legal costs and was dropping his lawyers. Last November, however, he was granted legal aid and will be defended by two junior barristers and solicitors. The prosecution will be led by Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens have had to wait more than three years for their case to come before a jury. Mr Seelig was arrested on October 15 1987 and Lord Spens on March 10 1988. The case against the seven men originally charged in connection with the Distillers takeover was trans- ferred to Southwark Crown Court in November 1988, when the trial was expected to begin the next summer. By June 1989 the date had been switched to the following January. In October 1989 Mr Justice Henry decided on split trials, with Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chair- man and chief executive, in both. Mr Seelig, Lord Spens and Mr David May- hew, senior corporate finance partner of Cazenove, the stockbrokers, were to be in the dock in the second trial. The first trial (Guinness One) involved Mr Saunders; Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron Group chairman; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and the then Sir Jack Lyons, a mil- ionaire financier subsequently stripped of hisknighthood. When that trial eventually began in mid Febru- ary last year it was anticipated that the second trial (Guinness Two) would start that October or Novem- ber. When Guinness One ended in late August, however, the second trial was put back to January and the case against Mr Saunders, who had been convicted on all but one of the charges he faced in the first trial, was dropped. Mr Saunders, Mr Ronson and Mr Parnes ware all Jailed, but have since been released after serving part of their sentences. Mr Ronson was also fined a record Â£5m. Mr Lyons, who was not jailed because of the state of his health, was fined Â£3m. Shortly before Christmas the sec- ond trial was split, leaving Mr May- hew to be tried in Guinness Three. Since then legal arguments and appeals, coupled with Lord Spens' new lawyers' need for time to prepare his defence, have resulted in further postponements. In mid July the Law Lords refused to give Mr Seelig and Lord Spens leave to appeal against a pre-trial ruling, and the last obstacle to the start of the trial was removed. Guinness Three is expected to come to court soon after Guinness Two, with Guinness Four, involving Mr Thomas Ward, a Washington lawyer and former Guinness non-executive director, to follow. Tony Andrews Roger Seelig outside Southwark Crown Court yesterday: he will conduct his own defence after deciding that he cannot afford lawyers",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Reynolds - .1 S1 nIreU nUlilZ agu, UII SJune 25, in Prague an event of historic impor- tance took place which would have seemed unbelievable barely two years ago. The heads of the newly-constituted anti-trust authorities of Poland, Hungary and Czecho- slovakia met for the first time. The meeting took place in the context of the International Bar Association's East Euro- pean Forum Conference. Before an international audi- ence of lawyers, including many from central and eastern European countries, the heads of the new competition watch- dogs explained the competition laws which had been enacted in their countries and the prob- lems they foresaw in trying to enforce them. An effective competition pol- icy and an agency with the teeth to enforce it are indis- pensable components of the transition to a free-market economy. As in western Europe, there is no point removing powerful state monopolies with the ability to dominate the market only to find that they are replaced by private concerns which retain great market power which they may abuse by, for example, charging excessive prices. Experience in the UK has shown how important it is to ensure that newly-privatised undertakings are subjected to supervision and regulation. In addition, it is important to ensure, through merger con- trol, that the privatisation pro- cess does not lead to a situa- tion where a particular market continues to be dominated by one or two significant players. In the period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the re-unification of Germany there appeared to be a merger control vacuum in East Ger- many with the result that one or two West German concerns were able to acquire dominant market positions in the east. Deals such as the acquisition of GDR State Insurance by west Germany's Allianz Insur- ance and the takeover of the east German gas network by Ruhr-Gas eventually set alarm bells ringing in Brussels. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, felt forced to intervene to try to prevent the creation of new monopoly posi- tions in east Germany which might prejudice the interests of German consumers and com- petitors from other EC states. In central and eastern Europe one of the difficulties in applying competition law will be that the rules are being brought into force and oper- ated in countries which have never known such disciplines. Anti-trust laws had no role to play in command economies where often the whole market took the form of a cartel and where control of the economy by large monopolies and price fixing through centralised planning were endemic to the system. Even now, newly-privatised enterprises will continue to operate in the context of a heavily-concentrated distribu- tion system. It will take a long time to shake off bad habits acquired over some 40 years in a system where markets were shared with impunity, com- plete sectors were dominated by a single monopoly and enterprises traded on agreed prices fixed by government. The task facing the new reg- ulators in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia is daunt- ing. In Prague, they made clear their determination to apply the new competition laws to ensure that newly-privatised companies obey the rules of free competition and that merger control provisions are applied to achieve deconcentra- tion where possible. What resources and powers have been put at their disposal? Hungary's Office for Eco- nomic Competition is headed by Ferenc Vissi and adminis- ters the Act on Prohibition of Unfair Market Practices passed by the Hungarian Parliament on September 20 1990. Agreements which restrict competition are prohibited whether they are concluded in Hungary or not. Exemptions are possible, but will be more difficult when the parties have a joint market share which exceeds 30 per cent. Activities which result in the abuse of \"economic superiority\" - defined as a 30 per cent market share - are prohibited. Notification has to be made in the case of mergers where the joint market share of the merging parties exceeds 30 per cent or joint turnover exceeds lObn forints. The Office for Economic Competition can impose fines for infringement of the Act's provisions. Poland's Anti-Monopoly Office was established in April 1990 with Anna Fornalczyk as its president. The office has a staff of 20 lawyers and econo- mists and, unusually, has regional offices in important Polish cities outside Warsaw. Miost cartel authorities in Europe are heavily centralised. Poland's Anti-Monopoly Law, adopted on February 24 1990, prohibits monopolistic practices and abuse of domi- nant positions in the market. Merger control provisions give wide power to the Office to intervene when mergers result in the creation of, or strength- ening of, a dominant market position. Sanctions under the Polish law are more stringent than under the laws of Hungary or Czechoslovakia - indeed, they are more stringent than compe- tition laws in western Europe. Managers of defaulting compa- nies can be fined personally, something which is not possi- ble even under the draconian EC competition provisions. Fines on companies can be up to 15 per cent of turnover, com- pared with a maximum of 10 per cent under EC rules. There is also power to divide and liq- uidate companies which per- manently limit competition. In Czechoslovakia there is a Federal Office for Competition based in Bratislava and headed by Imrich Flassik; a Slovak Anti-Monopoly Office also based in Bratislava and a Czech counterpart based in Brno - three cartel offices where two years ago there was none. The Federal Office has juris- diction where the entrepre- neurs concerned account for more than 40 per cent of the relevant market in Czechoslo- vakia as a whole. It is not sur- prising that jurisdictional prob- lems between the various offices are already emerging. The Act on Protection of Economic Competition adopted on January 30 1991 and admin- istered by the Federal Office is similar to the Polish and Hun- garian laws. Cartel agreements are banned as impermissible and are nullified. Dominant positions arise at 30 per cent of market share and it is provided that such positions should not be misused. Merger control provisions are triggered when the merging undertakings con- trol more than 30 per cent of the market. The fundamental question is: how effective will enforcement of these laws be? Many coun- tries have competition laws on the statute book which are often quietly ignored or enforced half-heartedly. Anti-trust regulators are rarely popular even in coun- tries with a long tradition of competition law enforcement. Industrialists often regard their activities with hostility and they are involved in fre- quent battles with other gov- ernment departments responsi- ble for encouraging industrial development. Political pressure on and interference with the three new agency heads and their offices is likely to be intense in the early days as their coun tries grapple with the new rig ours of the market economy. In Prague they stated their intention to stand up to these pressures. At the beginning, at least, enforcement will depend entirely on them. Although the new laws make provision for enforcement of the competition rules through the courts, it is questionable how many private anti-trust actions there will be in the absence of specialist anti-trust lawyers and judges. An excellent start has been made. The laws themselves are coherent and harmonise remarkably with each other. This is because they have all been based on the model of the EC competition rules - no doubt with an eye to possible accession to the Community one day. That the agencies should be allowed to succeed in the task: of properly enforcing these laws is vital for the success of the transition to a full market economy.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston THE LIQUIDITY, financial adaptability and viability of a company are of vital concern to its investors and bankers. Put another way, a key mea- sure of the performance of any company is the amount of cash it generates. Assessment of any company in this respect, however, is almost impossible using only the information provided in its accounts. Those unschooled in the Alice-in-Wonderland logic of company accounts may find it extraordinary, but there is a world of difference between the profits announced by a company and the cash it gener- ates. Big quoted companies, such as Polly Peck and Brent Walker, have faced severe financial difficulties only months after their accounts showed they were making record profits. Part of the explanation is that even the most conservatively managed companies show as profit sums of money that have not yet been received in cash. As long as accounting rules are not abused, in the way that they are by some companies, reported profits are a reliable guide to performance over the longer term. But during a recession, investors and bank- ers should be more interested in any company's ability to pay its bills - they need to know how much cash it is actually receiving. The first Financial Reporting Standard issued by the Accounting Standards Board, established earlier this year to overhaul UK accounting stan- dards, should at long last force companies to provide useful cash flow information. Profes- sor David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, believes that FRS 1, published today, is the most important of all the new standards which will eventually be produced by the body. A cash flow statement will not need to be produced by all businesses. There is an exemp- tion for small companies as defined by the Companies Act for those satisfying two of the following conditions: they should have sales less than Â£2m, fewer than 50 employees or total assets less than Â£975,000. They usually have few outside investors and the cost of preparing a cash flow statement was thought by the ASB to be excessive in relation to the benefits. However, for all other com- panies FRS 1 supersedes State- ment of Standard Accounting Practice 10 for accounting peri- ods ending on or after March 23 1992. SSAP 10 required com- panies to provide a ledger of the source and application of its funds. But the effective defi- nition of cash - or rather funds generated by operations - in this statement was too crude. In the year to December 31, 1989, Polly Peck disclosed that it generated funds of Â£172m from operations. On the basis of that figure, there was no reason for investors to believe that' within months it would find it impossible to pay its creditors on time. XYZ LTDs CASH PLOW POR YEAR ENDED 01/4/1992 rVm0 rooM Net cash Inflow from operating actlivilles 6,889 Returns on Investments and aervicing of finance Interest received 3.011 Interest paid (12) Dividends paid (2,417) Nat cash Inflow firom returns on Investments and servicing of finance 582 Taxation Corporation tax paid (incliuding advance corporation tax) (2,922) Tax paid (2.922) Investing acIvilies Payments to acquire intangible fixed assets (71) Payments to acquire fixed assets (1,496) Receipts from sales of tangible fixed assets 42 Net cash outflow from Investing activities - (1,525) Net cash Inflow before financing 3,024 Financing Issue of ordinary share capital 211 Repurchase of debenture loan (149) Expenses paid in connection with share issues (5) Net cash Inflow from financing 57 INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 3,0M1 Companies were given too much latitude in preparation of the funds statement. It was dif- ficult to make meaningful com- parisons between what differ- ent companies said about funds generation. In FRS 1, however, the ASB has laid down far more rigid rules. The table above shows how the statement will appear in most accounts. The first line in the new statement, perhaps the most meaningful line, is net cash flow from operations. All companies will be obliged to provide a note to their accounts showing how they reconcile their profits with this net cash inflow from operations. In the basic version of the reconciliation statement, oper- ating profit is adjusted to take account of movements in work- ing capital - stocks, debtors and creditors - and for those items like depreciation, which a do not involve the movement c of cash. d If Polly Peck had been forced t to draw up such a cash flow f statement in its 1989 accounts, i it would probably have shown a a net cash outflow of Â£129m, c because of its sharp increase in t stocks and \"debtors\" (money 1 owed to the company) during the period. That figure, which f might have served as a warn- k ing to investors and bankers, I could have been calculated a from its accounts, but only I after much labour. I The ASB is encouraging a companies to provide a more useful breakdown of net cash a flow from operations by the f \"direct method of analysis\", c although this is not compul- a sory. For a typical industrial i company, this procedure will t show cash received from cus- a tomers, cash payments to sup- a pliers, cash paid to employees a and other cash outgoings. For the first time, accounts should c give an insight into the minu- a tiae of where funds come from. r All the companies interest a and dividend flows will also f have to be shown separately, i which is a distinct improve- s ment over the funds statement. i Another useful innovation is a that companies will have to 1 provide more detail on how cash was invested during the i accounting period. c Payments to acquire fixed c assets will be shown separately c from investments in goodwill, t or intangible assets. The pro- ceeds from asset sales will be deducted from the sum of these two figures to give a net figure for the inflow or outflow from investment activities. In effect, a clearer picture will be given of what the company is doing to generate profits over the long term. Much of the rest of the cash flow statement is familiar. Nonetheless, shareholders are likely to find the overall state- ment invaluable and should perhaps turn to it before looking at the profit and loss account. What could have been learnt about Polly Peck if it had been forced to produce a complete cash flow statement in its 1989 accounts? Drafting the state- ment now is complicated by the paucity of information available in its accounts. But an approximation can be attempted. Overall, it suffered a net cash outflow of Â£883m, taking account of the results of its mainstream trading business and its investments. It financed this outflow by issu- ing Â£286m of new share capital, selling Â£37m of bonds, increas- ing long-term loans by Â£406m and pushing up short-term loans by Â£281m. This was a company expand- ing with remarkable rapidity despite the fact that its trading operations were eating up cash. That would have been useful to know.",

   "text_content" : "John Authers reports on efforts by life assurance and other investment groups to sell their products W hat is this myste- rious woman try- ing to sell you? \"Glamorous\" products, such as clothing and perfume, leap to mind. Perhaps she is about to wrap her tongue round the latest crumb- ling chocolate bar. In fact, the woman is a Scot- tish Widow, and she has spear- headed a successful advertis- ing campaign by a long-established Edinburgh life assurance group - about as unglamorous a product as it is possible to imagine. These tactics are the latest attempt to break out of a severe problem for life assur- ance and other investment companies. Financial products are misunderstood, and the companies that produce them have a low profile. But it is hard to appeal directly to the consumer with- out alienating the large and powerful intermediary network which is in place. Life offices antagonise these at their peril. Scottish Widows' campaign has been arguably the most successful among the large investment houses which have adopted a similar approach. These have included weighty names previously glad to be dull, such as Scottish Amicable and the Prudential. It is easy to see why these tactics seem necessary - mar- ket research suggests that con- sumers are ignorant and dis- trustful of the industry, while much marketing misses its tar- get. Mintel summed up the posi- tion in a damning report ear- lier this year. \"The banks, building societies, insurance companies and credit card sup- pliers spent a staggering Â£424m in 1990 advertising their ser- vices, and the majority of the population still don't know what they are buying,\" it said. Mintel found two main causes for the difficulties that marketeers face. One is igno- rance, which the proliferation of more complicated new prod- ucts has exacerbated. The new advertising is either too com- plex for \"novices\", or does nothing to help them under- stand. The other problem is distrust of intermediaries. Most people believe that there is no such thing as independent financial advice. Distrust is greatest among the people who could provide the most lucrative business. A smaller qualitative survey by Prospektus, another market research company, found that high net worth individuals think that advice is \"sales by another name\". Such scepticism persists despite the root and branch reform of investor protection made by the Financial Services Act in 1987. In some ways, this could have made the basic problem of explaining finance to \"novices\" all the harder. The Act stamped on mislead- ing illustrations and claims for product performance, and insisted on \"health warnings\" to ensure that potential inves- tors understood the risks they were taking. This made it much harder to make a con- vincing case for one company's product without introducing a mass of information. However, the FSA permits companies to avoid small print, provided they restrict them- selves to generic advertising, promoting name awareness alone. This explains the Scottish Widows strategy. We do not know whether the widow holds a pension, a life assurance pol- icy, or a unit trust - all we know is that she represents the company. She promotes name recognition and nothing else. David Lewis of Dewe Roger- son, the public relations com- pany which helped to devise the Widows campaign, explains: \"What the Widows has done is take the discipline of fast-moving consumer goods branding and apply it to the financial market. Until about five years ago advertising in this market was fairly dated and unsophisticated.\" Scottish Widows noticed that much financial advertising falls to put across specific corn- pany names. It also had to con- tend with the disadvantage of a brand name which nobody sitting down now with a clean sheet of paper would choose for a new company. It sounds vaguely intimidat- ing, and implies that its prod- ucts are only for widows. How- ever, the name had built up sufficient reputation - the company has more than Â£12bn under management - that change was out of the ques- tion. The current advertising addresses both problems. According to Lewis: \"It branded the company very clearly, and took the widow head on. Nobody will forget which company was being advertised. Also, it gave Scot- tish Widows a more modern friendly personality than is so suggested by the name.\" Heightened name awareness su helps, although most of the ha company's sales are through ac independent financial advisers, nc unlikely to be swayed by such tactics. If consumers feel corn- ar sortable with Scottish Widows' he name they are more likely to st buy one of its products if an m adviser mentions it. Mi An alternative approach is O1 not to market to \"novices\", but eq instead to aim at \"experts\". uc One of the few groups to use wl this strategy with success is vi' Fidelity, the US-owned group, lei best known as a unit trust manager. It is now the fifth of largest unit trust group in the di UK, although it has only been tu active in this country for ev around a decade. lii Victoria Philip, Fidelity's m marketing director, admits ge that the group's marketing m; strategy to date has been \"very tM much preaching to the con- verted\". bi Thus its newspaper adver- gr tisements have the tone of an Sc approachable \"broker's note\". sa Typically a few paragraphs are pr included, accompanying a sim- at ple exposition of the case for \"s \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t some specific sector. The group's market share suggests this approach must have worked. However, Philip accepts that the strategy has not expanded the market. According to Fidelity, around 4 per cent of Britons hold unit trusts, a figure which still seems to be lower than it might be thanks to the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987. The figure for equivalent investment prod- ucts is 20 per cent in the US, where investor confidence sur- vived the 1987 crash more or less intact. The fundamental problems of an uneducated market and a distrusted intermediary struc- ture remain untouched. How- ever, the experience of two big life insurers with different marketing philosophies sug- gests that more traditional marketing can still be effec- tive. Standard Life is the UK's biggest mutual life assurance group, but has not adopted Scottish Widows' tactics. It says that a brand image which projects a \"persona\" is a valu- able property, but it is only \"skin deep\". However, it is cur- rently in the midst of a \"com- munications audit\", which may lead to a new corporate image. Standard Life has also added to its distribution channels, and its products are now sold by the Halifax Building Society, as well as by indepen- dent advisers. The pre-eminent brand values that Standard Life believes it should aim for are \"level of service\" and \"cus- tomer care\". These sentiments are endorsed by Abbey Life, a much younger group which has built up 1.1m clients over the past 30 years, mostly on the back of a highly motivated sales force. It has decided that the costs of a heavy advertis- ing campaign could not be jus- tified. Lester Young, product mar- keting manager of Abbey Life, does think that the Financial Services Act has levered up the standards of salesmen. But the company has recognised the depth of the problem confront- ing them in public awareness, and simply carried on applying the industry's old adage: \"Life assurance is not bought. It has to be sold.\"",

The agreement represents a rare example of collaboration within the UK engineering design consultancy sector, despite suggestions that it would benefit from a more co- operative approach. Separately, UK consultan- cies including International Automotive Design, Ricardo and Lotus Engineering have established themselves as lead- ing suppliers of design and engineering services to the world motor industry. However, previous sugges- tions by some in the industry, such as Group Lotus chief executive Michael Kimberley, that partnerships should be formed between companies with complementary skills have hitherto gone largely ignored.

   "text_content" : "Louise Kehoe examines why Intel is in danger of losing its dominance in the microprocessor market n the market for micro- processor chips that form the brains of personal computers, Intel is king. Ever since IBM chose an Intel microprocessor for its first PC 10 years ago, Intel has domi- nated the field. In recent months, however, Intel's stronghold has been under constant attack. Mount- ing competition, legal chal- lenges and the changing face of the desktop computer market have raised serious questions about the company's ability to maintain its rule over the PC chip market of the 1990s. The IBM PC standard that anointed Intel's microproces- sors is beginning to crumble. In a joint venture with Apple Computer, IBM now aims to create a new standard for per- sonal computing based upon its own high-speed Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) microprocessors. Rise microprocessors streamline processing by trading off speed against complexity. Compaq Computer, the lead- ing manufacturer of IBM-com- patible PCs (all Intel based), has joined Digital Equipment and others in backing the development of computers based upon the R4000 Rise microprocessor from Mips Computer. Neither IBM nor Compaq Computer, two of Intel's big- gest customers, is planning to abandon the Intel microproces- sor architecture, but it is clear that when the fifth generation of Intel microprocessors, the \"586\", makes its debut next year it will not inherit the PC market crown without some stiff competition. Andrew Grove, Intel presi- dent, is undaunted. \"We are leading in technology, leading in installed base, and leading in the [manufacturing] infra- structure that is required to deliver these things [micropro- cessors] in the multiple tens of millions of units per year,\" he maintains. Building the fastest micro- processors is now only one ele- ment of the competition. Rec- ognising this, Intel is attempting to carry out a sig- nificant shift of corporate strat- egy \"Our whole corporate men- tality has to be changed,\" explains Gro, \"m finding new apphleations for Intel sili- can to makng Intel-baend com- puters superior.\" Thus lvlvs several factors affecting sys- tern performance, including both software i hardware. To dafe an IBM-cneptlbe PC system software been designed to run only on Intel microprocessors, but Intel acknowledges that it may lose this exclusive advantage. \"Sys- tem software is going to be built in such a fashion that it is relatively easy to adapt from one architecture to another,\" in the future, Grove acknowl- edges. \"That is the reality of the open computing world.\" Examples include Sun Micro- systems's recently announced Solaris, a Unix-based operating system that will run on Sun's Spare chips and on Intel's microprocessors. Microsoft's \"Windows NT\", a PC operating system due next year, will run on Mips Computer's R4000 as well as on Intel's chips. While many see these devel- opments as a threat to Intel, Grove maintains that his com- pany is well positioned to take advantage of the boost that these software advances should give to the sluggish PC market. \"I'm overjoyed with the influx of money, resources and talent that are being poured into system software development,\" says Grove. He sees the new operating systems unplugging the \"soft- ware bottleneck\" that has pre- vented computer users taking full advantage of advances in micrCopcessor technology. \"It been very frustrating from an Intel point of view to develop new technology that theoretically doubles perfor- mance and then see the perfor- mance improvement degraded by a 10-year-old operating sys- tenm [MS-DOS],\" says Grove. While one set of competitors aims to unseat Intel's micro- processors with alternative chip designs, another set is focused upon cubashing in on aIntel's success with \"clonmes\" of its current microprocessor products; chips that emulate the functions of the Intel design without directly copy- tag them. Advanced Micro Devkes, a rival Sicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, lacedi its own version of the 386 chip (the procenor which powers most of today's PCs) sit months ago and has alteady won a 15 per cent shMe of the PC mariet. accod- I Andrew Groe: Nobody is going to euLpeiorm our producm' ing to market analysts. I Intel recently lost out to c AMD when Grid Systems, a I subsidiary of Tandy, ( announced a new desktop com- i puter based upon AMD's 386 t chip.

I Unlike some of Its cdmped- a tors, which have banded I together in tears chf ipmk- ers and cumnpuer -cmp-.ns to I support new architectures, I such as those mseal on R 1c processors, Intel insists on d going it alone. The company C has not licensed any other chipmaker to produce its most recent generations of products (the 386 and 486 chip families) except IBM, which manufac- turnes the 386 for its own con- sumption. Intel has also taken a hard line in protecting its Intellec- tual property rights. The com- pany has filed suit against AMD, Cyrix, a small Texas chipmaker, and a number of other \"clone\" chip makers. Now the industry is watching to se whether Cdips & Tech- nologies' new 38a products will also prompt attention from Intets kwySn AMD and Cyrix have, how- ewr, fled countersualts charg tog MIte with antik-ompetit business practices. Intel has denied any nwromgiAig but the company's sales tactics are now also the subject of a US Justice Department anti-trust investigation. \"We developed a product all on our own. We created a mar- ket for it all on our own and introduced it all on our own. If someone else wants to develop a product, in my view they have to do it all on their own . . . not on the basis of any assistance from the intel- lectual property that was developed . . . by this com- pany,\" Grove states adamantly. The company aims to keep a step ahead of the clones by drawing computer makers towards its next generation microprocessors, which have yet to be emulated by competi- tors. The move is risky. By accelerating the pace in the microprocessor market, Intel could prematurely kill demand for established products. Competition has also forced Intel to cut prices of some of its PC devices. These tactics could have a detrimental impact upon Intel's short-term earnings and its long-term strategy. Maximising profits from current products is criti- cal to Intel's future. Microprocessor development and manufacturing costs have increased exponentially over the past 10 years. The 586, due out next year, will have cost Intel several hundred million dollars to develop - up from a few million for the 8086, Intel's first 16-bit microprocessor, launched in 1978. In addition to the 586 proces- sor Intel is already developing sixth and seventh generation microprocessor technology that it says will appear in the mid-1990s. \"Nobody is going to outperform our products. There will be no motivation for anybody to shift from our microprocessor architecture to another,\" says Grove, although competitors see him trying to hold back a tide of competition that will inevitably erode Intel's territory. In addition, Intel will spend more than $1bn en -u-adin manacturing tes t s year and expects to spend as much again in 198I. Tme huge costs of development and manufa- ture of ledingedge emirogr- cemasrs are a urrii to compe- tition, yet the potential rewards of whInnInog gIund in the microproeonr ket - one of the most profitable se mInts IO the semIeenetaOcr industry - ata a U Lget \"We Me convinced tiat eO- user demand fr hfiher mance personab there, that the tc olo =t of Ir \" N is G is t e Mi SS dodid to dc I OWit, aye tOnv",

   "text_content" : "Sponsors of football shirts can gain from televised matches. Jane Fuller reports on other advantages ast week Sheffield Wednesday Football Club took out an adver- tisement in a newspaper that does not have a sports page. Instead of trying to reach the fans, it was using the Financial Times to appeal for a \"big name shirt sponsor\" - the big name being corporate rather than sportive. It has had a sponsor before: Finlux, a Finnish television company. But now that it is back in the first division and holder of the Rumbelows League Cup, it wants to tap a richer vein of financial sup- port. Even last season, before the Premier League was formally mooted by the Football Associ- ation, first division clubs gained more than Â£5m from shirt sponsorship. The average of Â£253,000 per club was well over three times the second division equivalent of Â£75,500. Shirt sponsorship involves selling an advertising space of up to 200 sq cm on the front of the team's shirts. The package may also include the use of hospitality rooms, tickets and advertising around the pitch and in the match programmes. An important lure for the sponsors' clubs is that the com- pany's name will appear on television and in newspaper and magazine photographs. Graham Mackrell, club secre- tary at Sheffield Wednesday, says the motivation of spon- sors has changed. \"In the past, companies became involved because the chairman liked to go to the game with his mates. Now expenditure has to be jus- tified.\" When Mackrell was at Luton Football Club, Luton's sponsor, General Motors, was sent videos of appearances on tele- vision and press cuttings every week. \"If anyone did an inter- view without wearing some- thing with Vauxhall's griffin emblem on there would be a phone call from Detroit.\" Sheffield Wednesday reckons it should feature in at least one live televised game per season and some of its goals will also be included during half-time of other nationally broadcast matches. At the regional level, there is much more. Already this sea- son it has been the subject of two hour long programmes on Yorkshire Television. Television and photographs Watch this space: Sheffield Wednesday seeks another shirt-front are a limited form of advertis- ing in that they only show the company's name, without giv- ing product details or the cor- porate message. However, the the amount of air time a spon- sor receives is impressive. For instance, in one of Aston Villa's UEFA Cup games against Inter Milan, Mita Copi- ers' name appeared for more than 200 seconds. The chro- nometer did not count the numerous flashes of less than a second. Graham Bridgwater, market- ing director of CSS Group, which has been involved in gaining football sponsors, says that a 30-second advertising slot on the ITV network, at a good viewing time, would cost roughly Â£150,000. \"It is not unusual for the production of a commercial to cost Â£250,000.\" It must, however, be remem- bered that a handful of clubs dominate televised matches. The latest Digest of Football Statistics, published by the Sir Norman Chester research cen- tre, shows that in the 1989-90 season only 17 clubs featured in live games from the English League or cup competitions, out of a total of 92. But even within this select band, the focus is on a handful. Indeed a third of the 60 appear- ances involved Liverpool or Manchester United. United, which joined the stock market this summer, has been quick to capitalise. Its income from sponsorship, roy- alties and advertising has dou- bled from Â£1.2m in 1987-88 to an estimated Â£2.4m in the year to July 81. The club will receive another - fillip next year when its new Z contract with Umbro, the Man- chester-based kit manufac- turer, takes effect. But this is a different type of shirt-related - sponsorship. Whereas Sharp, - the Japanese electronics corn- pany, sponsors the club and - takes up the photo opportunity on players' chests, Umbro has bought the rights to make rep- lica kit and use the club badge on other products. Martin Prothero, promotions director of Umbro, says it spends Â£10m a year - about 80 per cent of its European mar- keting budget - on buying these rights from leading Euro- pean teams, including some national sides. The top amount going to any one of them is Â£lm. At second division Brighton and Hove Albion, on the other hand, the club handles its own - replica kit sales, using a Sur- rey manufacturer called Ribero. A new \"jazzy\" blue- stripe design has proved a corn- mercial success. Terry Gill, marketing manager, says the outfit has been compared with \"a Tesco shopping bag and a deck chair\". Yet in spite of the stir caused by the strip, the biggest single commercial income source is the club's sponsor, the TSB bank. The pressure on clubs to build up revenue from sources other than traditional gate receipts has been intensified by the Taylor Report on the disas- ter at Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday's ground, although the 95 deaths happened at an FA Cup semi-final. Implemen- tation by 1990 of requirements for all-seater stadiums will cost the 93 English Football League clubs an estimated Â£360m. Last season, shirt sponsor- ship (excluding replica rights) raised Â£8.5m, but the poor rela- tions in the fourth division were only averaging Â£24,000 each. However, only a dozen clubs - spread over all four divisions - were without such sponsorship. Darren Venn, the Football League's marketing manager, says clubs are having to adopt a more professional approach to their marketing efforts. \"Instead of just employing for- mer professional footballers, they are now taking on mar- keting people from other indus- tries.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Delia Bradshaw he catwalks of Paris and Milan may soon play host to a new group of designers eager to show off their autumn and spring collec- tions. Not the latest inginues, eager to challenge to suited sophistication of Chanel or the haute couture of Yves San Laurent, but personal com- puter manufacturers with the latest fashion in PCs. Leading the way is Japanese electronics manufacturer NEC. At its futuristic Advanced PC Design Centre, in Tokyo, a group of designers and engi- neers have been busy develop- ing a range of \"wearable\" PCs which transfer computer tech- nology from the desktop to the wrist or the waistband. This \"personal environment design\", as design supervisor Hideji Takemasa calls it, will transform the local PC store into a designer boutique rather than a warehouse, says NEC. So, what will the fashion- conscious PC user be wearing 15 years from now? The answer could depend on the job you do, as evidenced by some of the NEC's concept models. In the company's vision of the 21st century the business- man will be dressed in a subtle creation of black and grey. A tube running down his back will contain electronic compo- nentry and loop round to sup- port a visual display held out at waist level. A speaker and headphone atop the tube will enable the businessman to Input data. A camera and fax capabilities are also built into the unit. For journalists or writers the PC bsdlu' s alle O0 W \"Lapbody\" closely resembles the sort of machines available today. But instead of putting the laptop on a hard surface for use, the machines hang from shoulder straps and rest on the chest. The latest model for the up-to-date factory employee will be a two-piece yellow cre- ation, one half worn around the neck and the other on the left forearm. The arm unit incorporates an optical scanner to enable the wearer to read bar codes into the machine. This data can then be checked with data stored in a CD-Rom, for, say, checking stock. A unit jutting out from the neckpiece displays the information for the wearer to read. Emergency medics will wear a machine which keeps both hands free to allow patient treatment to continue uninter- rupted. The TLC (tender loving care) PC combines a hand-held \"track ball\" - which has built in sensors to measure the patient's vital signs - with computer processing power. . This information is displayed on specially-constructed gog- gles. A microphone is used to dictate details of the patient's condition, while a built-in cam- era transmits images to the hospital via satellite links. And for more general con- sumer use NEC has developed the Spoon PC, a round termi- nal face attached to a flexible stand with wheels attached. The PC can be towed along and then rested on the knee for use. In this vivid vision, the futuristic machine is finished in a delicate shade of pink.",

   "text_content" : "Pascale Blaison Ignorance of the company and a programme with illustrations of men in raincoats, somewhat grotesque female nudes, and featuring paragraphs about the search for identity - murky waters where personality dis- solves and the like - led me to approach Driftings with cau- tion. A few minutes after the show began, however, I was startled to find a smile of pure delight breaking over my face as the Compagnie Philippe Genty regaled their fortunate audience with a superb display of theatrical illusionism, pup- petry and dance. Pure theatre, if such a thing exists, must be something like this: skills honed and perfected to allow their practitioners to suggest a world of emotion and mystery from an empty coats- leeve or a slowly turning head - a puppet's head, manoeu- vred with careful fingers in a technique, without strings or awkward artificialities, based on the closest possible contact between the non-human and the human performers. Ancient tricks, quick-change routines, rope dances, fake lev itation, lengths of silk shaken about to suggest varying land scapes, are performed with such committed grace that they move beyond the clever less of skilful effect to operate just where the programme said, somewhere where things dissolve and meanings shift. Part of the magic lies in the quality of observation. The puppets, representing men in raincoats (from very tiny to half-life), glamorous women from half-life to huge) and goldfish, assisted by a tiny train, an aeroplane, an ocean liner and a city skyline which transforms into a jungle-ringed volcano, are superbly drawn and lit. The lighting designer, Eric Wurtz, is really the mas- ter of the revels, for most of the effects rely on the use of deep blackout. Dressed alike, the human and puppet per- formers become interchange- able, definitely identifiable as one only when contrasted with the other, a point made touch- ingly in the final scene. Philippe Genty has travelled the world working with pup- pets for the last 30 years, devel- oping a technique which, though it reminds of much, is ultimately unique. His com- pany serve him wonderfully, whether, like his wife, choreog- rapher Mary Underwood, they have been with him for 20 years, or whether, like the young graduates of Lecoq and Decroux, they have been drawn to work which makes full use of those \"theatre skills\" so often talked of, so little seen. Those whose task it is to bring magic to our stages should rush to Sadler's Wells. Lynn MacRitchie",

   "text_content" : "\"Sick like its author\", was Strindberg's verdict on first seeing A Doll's House. A few years later, he answered Ibsen's feminism with Miss Julie (1888), portrait of a man-hating Amazon whose independent sexuality breaks loves and lives. In a midsummer night's frenzy, Miss Julie seduces servant Jean, then kills herself when he repudiates her. Theirs is a double battle: sex and class: the valet lives on while Miss Julie dies for honour. Class and sex hatred breathes life into the play, but it takes a skilled contemporary direc- tor to negotiate pitfalls of snobbism and misog- yny and let the unconscious motivation, the revelations of inner turmoil, speak for them- selves. A century on, while strong productions can still make A Doll's House seem revolution- ary, Miss Julie is a tougher nut to crack. In Leander Haussmann's major revival of the new Frankfurt season, the play remains a hard, resisting kernel at the centre of a whirligig of irrelevant trappings, additional sub-plots and fancy diversions. An extra cohort of women in white throw midsummery glances at Jean; Julie (Martina Schumann), the most moonstruck, seems almost incidentally the one to get him under the table and hump up and down with tablecloth as sheet and broken guitar as pillow. Jean (Matthias Brenner), unbothered by all the attention, is Leporello rather than Don Gio- vanni, proudly boorish where Strindberg intended wily social climbing, yet easy match for his mistress in cultural razzle-dazzle. When she sings Cherubino, he responds as Papageno; she quotes Hamlet, he answers with Faust. There's rock too, the girls in white howling like Elvis fans when Jean removes his jacket to bop; judo-cum-tapdance in the famous moment when he kisses her shoe, and country and west- ern as Miss Julie finally walks off stage - not, here, to suicide, but to sit out the dance. Strindberg as variety show, Midsummer Night's Dream with only the rude mechanicals and no awakening - if Haussmann wanted cheerful spectacle, why did he choose this play? As an entertainer, he is unable to distinguish wedding from funeral. Heavy symbolism - pearls spilling to the ground at the first embrace; a midsummer maiden brought on dead to compensate for Miss Julie's survival; a green finch slaughtered, its blood drank as wine - shoots through the slapstick and song like the ghost of Thomas Hardy at a comedy writer's feast. Miss Julie is a one-act short sharp shock of a play; Haussmann's clutter spins it out to two and a half hours. The only unity is that cheap thrills dictate melodrama and farce alike. Methinks Strindberg has been entangled with an ass. Jackie Wullschlager British win at the Prix Italia Yesterday in Pesaro the first three full-blown Prix Italia awards for 1991 were announced: British competitors won all three; of the three additional \"special\" prizes, the British won two. In the first of the television categories, Arts, they achieved a clean sweep. The Prix Italia was won by the BBC with the inspiring programme, From Moscow To Pietushki. The special award went to Channel 4's TVDante. In this year's \"extra\" category, for television credits and title sequences, the jury watched 92 entries and awarded the Prix Italia to The South Bank Show. The special prize went to Channel 4 for the \"best over all package\" which included the titles for Going Loco, EArcops, The Manag- eress and others. In the radio music category the Prix Italia was awarded to Who Pays The Piper a hilari- ously funny half-hour history of music, in the form of a poem by Richard Stilgoe, made for Radio 2.

   "text_content" : "J Ithough his talent has never been in doubt, Adrian Lyne has always stood accused of slickness and a clality in his approach to = . Jacob's Ladder provides an emphatic answer to these charges. It is his finest, most serious piece of work to date, a film whose admitted flaws somehow fail to detract from its strange power. Jacob's Ladder tells the story of a Vietnam vet (Tim Bobbins) who is plagued by memories of one confused battle in which members of his platoon seemed to go collectively insane. Sev- eral years after returning home, these bad memories start to become hellish visions. He sees his girlfriend (Eliza- beth Pena) coupling with a demon, watches a horn sprout from the head of a nurse, hal- lucinates about his son who died in a traffic accident some years earlier. These visions are so intense that he suspects he may be suffering a delayed reaction to something that happened to him in the war. He begins an investigation which leads him into a web of government intrigue, the occult and, ultimately, his own troubled psyche. It is a compelling, confusing and often brilliant film, keep- ing you off-balance while still holding your attention. Rob- bins is excellent, his pensive, doughy face capable of remark- able expressiveness as he wan- ders through dreams, moods and situations. Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin writes with more maturity and less senti- mentality than he brought to bear on his earlier film, Ghost refusing pat answers or easy outs. Only at the very end does his story falter by adding one layer of meaning too many. Lyne's direction is both less steady and more inspired than in 9'% Weeks or Fatal Attrac- tion. The expected remarkable effects are all here - the heart- beat-like thump of a helicopter as it hovers above a wounded soldier, the stroboscopic besti- ality of Pena's demonic dance, the charnel terror of an imagi- nary hospital. And yet, there is now a sense that Lyne is not so much creating imagery for its own sake as using it to explore a man's haunted mind. He stumbles occasionally in this attempt, especially by letting things drag a bit midway, though even here I felt these were the flaws of a virtuoso pushing himself for once, rather than playing it safe. It is a pleasing change to witness. Another director who seems to be changing course in mid- career is Istvan Szabo. Meeting Venus marks a radical depar- tuhire from the epic profundities of Mephisto and Colonel Red, showing Szabo to be a satirist with a pleasingly light touch. Unfortunately, he cannot in the end resist the temptation to weigh his work down with symbol and meaning, making for a film that leaves you feel- ing a little cheated. Meeting Venus details the tribulations of a Hungarian conductor (Niels Arestrup) as hie attempts to stage a major production of Tannhauser in Paris. Despite his high aspira- tions, rehearsals soon degener- ate into farce, with union trou- ble, international infighting and a temperamental Swedish diva (Glenn Close) combining to turn an artistic undertaking into a bureaucratic nightmare. In this show, even the under- studies turn out to have dirigi- ble-sized egos. Szabo's render- ing of these backstage squabbles is often hilariously telling, such as when a cacoph- ony of alarm watches inter- rupts a Wagnerian chorus to indicate that it is time for a coffee break. Satire is abandoned, how- ever, the moment that Close and Arestrup share an umbrella during a Paris rain- storm and fall madly in love. Suddenly, light artistic folly is replaced by brooding amour fou, making for an ineffective melodrama that tries to echo the high themes of Wagner's work. And that's the problem - Szabo renders the lovers' emotions in operatic terms, with big lines and inflamed emotions that have no ground- ing in reality. When Arestrup gets arrested trying to break into Close's hotel room, or she tells him he's the love of her life, you wonder if you've missed some scenes. The pro- fundity Szabo hints at here is a big empty. It is as if he forgot what he was poking such wicked fun at in the first part of the film. Arestrup labours heroically to keep up with the script, though Close's inexpli- cable transformation from a headstrong diva to a doe-eyed, crush-ridden girl seems to have befuddled even this most canny of actresses. You cannot help but wish that the lovers had gone on hating each other - it would have made for a more consistently enjoyable film.

Set during the 1950s, it tells the story of a pious undertaker (Forest Whit- aker) who becomes involved with a voluptuous gangster's moll (Robin Givens) after she arrives in Harlem with a cache of stolen gold. Unfortunately, Given's double-crossed boy- friend is hot on her trail, forc- ing Whitaker to seek help from his conman half-brother (Greg- ory Hines). A series of raucous, violent episodes ensue, leading to a finale neater than any- thing you would ever find in real life. Despite the temptation to lump it with the current wave of African-American cinema, A Rage in Harlem is really con- Tim Robbins and Matt Craven in 'Jacob's Ladder' vZentional Hollywood fare, thi blending love story and crime sh; drama into a concoction that is pa smooth and sassy in parts, vio- val lent and vulgar in others. boi Young director Bill Duke Ku shows flashes of stylish talent, ol especially in the atmospheric an opening scenes, but too often sin relies on stagy violence. Worse, fib several of the minor charac- Am ters, including Zakes Mokae as ple a transvestite pimp, are ludi- thi crously underdeveloped. wa Although Whitaker and Hines an are as fine as always, and the Ku stunning Givens is better than you would expect, this is a film So that needed a steadier, more no patient hand behind the cam- sir era to make it really work. Mi * Th Akira Kurosawa's genius has be always been his ability to paint coi on a large canvass, colouring he the screen with broad cine- (J( matic strokes and epic tales. In Mi Rhapsody in August the great thi Japanese director tries with ho mixed success to draw in min- thi iature. The film tells the story sts of an elderly widow (Sachiko ini Murase) who is visited by her th half-American nephew (Rich- ch ard Gere) when he comes to de Japan to make an atonement ck for the fact that Murase's hus- it band was killed by the atomic be bomb at at Nagasaki. The film tel is occasionally moving, espe- fu] cially the scene in which ac Murase's grandchildren visit the school playground where their grandfather died, their shadows on the naked pavement suggesting the vaporised victims of the atomic bomb. But for the most part Kurosawa relies on good old-fashioned sentimentality, an approach which seems singularly inappropriate to the film's difficult subject matter. And Gere is completely out of place, looking more bemused than normal, as if he'd wandered onto the set from another shoot. For die-hard Kurosawa fans only. * Someone who seems to have no trouble at all working on a small scale is writer/director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, whose The Object of Beauty proves to be a finely crafted little comedy. It tells the story of a hedonistic American couple (John Malkovich and Andie MacDowell) living far beyond their means at a posh London hotel. They decide to stage the theft of a small Henry Moore statue in order to collect on the insurance, yet are beaten to the punch by a deaf-mute chambermaid who develops a deep love for the piece while cleaning their room. Although it could just as easily have been a stage play or a television drama, the film is full of witty writing and strong acting. Stephen Amidon",

   "text_content" : "It sounds like carrying coals to Newcastle, though of course less noisy and more soignee. French music in Lyon, yes, and what else is new? The organisers of this new festival see things differently. On the initial bro- chures, \"la musique francaise\" was pre- fixed by the truculent, poignant phrase \"n dtait une fois...\": there used to be French music. Though the phrase was politely omit- ted from the final programme-book (some living French composers were represented, after all) its thrust was retained. In France during the past 30 years, according to the festival directors Marcel Landowski and Yves Petit de Voize, the generically French repertoire has almost vanished amid the standard cosmopolitan concert-pops; Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel turn up as interna- tional competitors, but with their vital roots and their contemporaries forgot- ten. Only some elderly persons still appreciate the lyrical tradition of Gounod and Massenet, and therefore - or arguably, at least! - France's rich music of the late 1800s and the early 1900s falls upon deaf modem ears. There is a defensive syndrome in all that, a sense that Austro-German musi- cal ideals have triumphed, and that the specific traits of French music may seem now to be merely provincial, quaintly charming. If \"symphonic argu ment\" d la Beethoven sets the intellec tual standard for music, even the French can hear that Cdsar Franck and his descendants mimicked the surface but rarely the original muscle. Almost always, counter-claims for distinctly Gallic virtues skid into the language of literary metaphor and the parfumerie. When the eloquent Nietzsche renounced Parsifal in favour of Carmen, he explained himself no better than that. Fortunately, the new Lyon festival doesn't depend upon reasoned justifica- lion. There is a coherent treasury of French music from Cherubini, Berlioz and Gounod to Debussy, Ravel, Poulenc and beyond; appreciating it seriously does require appreciating its back- round-history; in performance, finding the right answers to questions of histor- ical style can make all the differenc- between direct rewards and mere sepia reproductions. The real brief that the Lyon directors set for themselves was to put major pieces from their beloved period into the hands of maximally sympathetic performers, and let them speak for themselves. I thought they achieved that wonder- fully. In line with current fashion, the 10-day Biennale was concentrated around two long, intensive weekends. The first had begun with a repeat of the brilliant period-instrument concert, cul- minating in Berlioz's Symphonie fantas- tique, that John Eliot Gardiner gave in London a few days earlier. I arrived for Marek Janowski's Radio France Phil- harmonic programme: a poised, heart- felt account of Debussy's Damoiselle lue cantata (with soprano Catherine Dubosc), an urgent exposition of Chaus- son's B-flat Symphony - and a notable rediscovery from Andrd Caplet. Like Gabriel Piernd, Caplet rated himself below his leading contempo- raries, and gave selfless priority to pol- ishing their orchestration and promo- ting their music. In Britain only his harp-and-small orchestra fantasy after Poe, The Masque of the Red Death, has done the rounds recently. His Epiphanie with solo cello (Wang Jian) proved to be no less picturesque, depicting the exotic genuflections of Gaspar - one of the Three Kings - before the infant Say- iour in a Cortege, a searching cadenza- soliloquy and a final, quizzical \"Danse des petits negres\". Period-pungent, and genuinely original: other cellists must take it up. Next day Michel Plasson and his Orchestre National du Capitole de Toul- ouse gave us Gounod's \"trilogie sacrde\" Mars et Vita, a very long and pious oratorio which respects the limits of bourgeois French taste to the point of suffocation. Its overweening brass-com- plement for the Last Judgment secured only a modest effect. The American tenor John Aler led the soloists nobly, while the new soprano Isabelle Vernet made a pretty mark despite a slightly breathy, under-supported upper regis- ter. Her teacher Regine Crespin was always brighter and steadier than that. What we got in Mars et Vita were win- somely gracious lines, often over Gounod's favourite accompaniment- trick with soft horn-triplets - unabashed sub-Wagner opera, with dec- orous spiritual intentions. It supplied an essential background (one was Glad to Have Heard It), the better to set off far more interesting works; ru write about those later. David Murray",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "THE DUTCH, it turns out, are gamblers. Halfway through their presidency of the Euro- pean Community, and with only 10 weeks to go the fateful Maastricht summit, the Dutch government has decided to make radical changes to the draft political union treaty already on the table. Predictably, the British gov- ernment finds neuralgic the reference to the EC's \"federal vocation\", the wider role pro- posed for the European parlia- ment and the inclusion of for- eign and security policies within an EC framework. If it is not careful, however, it will strain at gnats, only to find it has swallowed a camel. The new draft is, for exam- ple, right to include foreign, external and internal security policies as an area of co-opera- tion among the Twelve. A com- mon foreign policy should be more effective, because more weighty, than one of any indi- vidual member country. The question is not whether such policies should wear an EC hat. It is how they should be decided and implemented. The failures of the draft lie elsewhere. Above all, it pro- vides only partial answers to fundamental questions about the future of what is already an entity with federal charac- teristics: how best to divide what the Community does from what member states do on their own, and how to decide what the Community does more democratically. Nothing in the Community - either its goals or institu- tions - has ever been thought through from first principles. The time has come, however, to set out a clearer blueprint. In theory, there are two ways to divide the powers. One answer is to write into the EC constitution a \"subsidiarity\" clause, making clear that those matters which are not consid- ered essential for collective action must be left to individ- ual states, while leaving deter- mination to the European Court of Justice. Ambiguous article Draft article 2A, for example, states that where the EC does not have exclusive compe- tence, it should only intervene \"if and to the extent the objec- tives assigned to it can be bet- ter realised at the Community level than at the level of mem- ber states acting on their own...\". Almost everything here hinges on what is meant by \"better\". This ambiguous definition would then be inter- preted by the Luxembourg bench, which would find itself making not only political but also arbitrary judgments. The other and far superior way is to enumerate fields of EC competence, with every- thing else left to member states. The subsidiarity princi- ple should be used not to deter- mine the locus of particular policies, but rather that of gen- eral powers. Education, health and social policy should, for example, be left almost entirely to the member states. Trade policy is for the EC. Labour market, transport, energy and environmental policies should be divided into those that largely affect the residents of the individual member states and those that have significant cross-border effects. This general approach has worked relatively smoothly in the bid to forge the single EC market by 1992, and should do in the case of economic and monetary union: one (federal) bank will run one currency, but economic policy will remain largely with member states, although some co-ordi- nation may be required. In addition, there are areas which logic suggests should be at the EC level, but the reali ties of politics ensure cannot be as yet. Separating the Com- munity role from the states' role in foreign affairs, for example, or in internal policing and immigration control, is hard. Sensitive areas One way of distinguishing sensitive, but legitimate, areas for common policy-making has become the means by which the Community votes on them. Sensitive areas are governed by unanimity. By contrast, when EC states agree to psettle a policy by majority, they are saying that they can be over ruled in that area. This requires either mutual trust or acceptance that the issue can be reliably deemed relatively unimportant. Neither condition holds in foreign policy. The solution must be to include these subjects within the EC framework, but main tain a strict unanimity require ment. Nor, in the case of for eign, security or immigration policies should the EC be allowed to prevent a member state from acting on its own, where it believes a vital inter- est is at stake. A different question-mark hangs over the ways in which the Dutch propose to introduce greater democracy into EC decision-making. More demo- cratic accountability is cer tainly needed in the Commu- nity. The Dutch propose to fill this \"democratic deficit\" by giving MEPs two things. First, a right to reject legislation coming out of a final, second reading by the Council. Sec- ond, MEPs would be made leg- islative co-equals with the Council in certain limited areas (aid, hi-tech and environ mental policies). But this would involve a complicated conciliation procedure, which works (just) in national bi-ca meral systems in the US and Germany, but would further delay the already lengthy EC law-making process. The Dutch proposals for a parliamentary veto should be accepted. Given that there is a parliament, this is the least it can be allowed to do. But the parliament should not as yet be granted co-equal power of initiation. In addition, foreign policy should be included within the EC framework, though under a unanimity requirement with safeguards for independent national action. What is needed most of all, however, is a proper division of powers and limitation of major- ity voting only to the essential areas. The British government should focus its attention here, where it matters, and not waste its efforts tilting at wind- mills.",

   "text_content" : "Robert Peston and David Barchard examine | Abbey National's Â£285m move to broaden its retail banking and insurance base bbey National's ambition, repeatedas a form of antra i ~i~by its directors, is to be \"the i Jk Marks and Spencer of the financial services market\". Its plan to buy Scottish Muitual for Â£285m, announced yesterday, is aimed at widening its product range. Just as. SM and Shas added h1ne furnishings to its range of knickers and salmon en croute, Abbey hopes to offer its own brand of life insurance alongside mortgages and savings accounts. \"Success in financial services lies in the ownership of the most appropriate and effective channels of distribu- tion,\" Mr Peter Birch, Abbey's chief executive, said yesterday. What he meant was that the banks and build- ing societies have a vast base of cus- tomers who should be interested in buying a range of financial products. Mr Birch described the deal as part of an \"acquire and build\" strategy, by which Abbey National uses the pur- chase of a smallish company to build up a new line of business. The benefits it will receive from the deal should include: * The ability to tailor its life assur- ance products to the needs of its cus- tomers; * A reduced reliance on the housing market as a source of earnings. The choice of Scottish Mutual came, Mr Birch said, after Abbey National had decided to buy a medium-sized mutual insurance company - owned by its policyholders rather then out- side shareholders - as a cheaper and more flexible option than starting up its own company, going into a joint venture, or buying a larger company. It will retain Scottish Mutual's tra- ditional business of selling policies though independent brokers. But over the longer term, fastest growth should come from a new company which it will set up with Scottish Mutual, to supply products to its branch custom- ers. The company will be called Abbey National Life, to take advan- tage of the power of its brand name in selling other financial services - the St Michael strategy. Abbey's profits, like those of M and S, are comparatively buoyant while rivals are flagging. It is the fifth big- gest UK bank, measured by the size of its balance sheet. However, its pre-tax profits of Â£308m for the six months to June - 10 per cent higher than the comparable six-month period of 1990 - were treble those of National West- minster Bank and within striking dis- tance of Barclays'. To put that achievement in perspec- tive, Abbey National has total assets of Â£50bn, compared with Barclays' Â£143bn. Abbey's success is based on its refusal to provide services to compa- nies. Losses on loans to businesses has been the clearing banks' Achilles heel during the recession. There is a second advantage to serving the retail market, which will be less than welcome to its customers. If bad debts on mortgages rise, as at 150 1990 Jul'89 1990 Sep 91 some: odesum. ~:iÂ·Â·i :I: i'i Â·-Â· i- :--i. :':::::. :Â·Â·Â·Â· Â·:Â·Â·~ ~ Â·Â·: I Â· '' l~g present, a retail bank such as Abbey can recoup the losses by widening the spread between what it charges for loans and what it pays on deposits. Improving the profit margin in this way is harder for banks serving the corporate market, because the corpo- rate market is so much more competi- tive. \"Unlike any other bank, Abbey has increased its margins every year for the past six years,\" says Mr John Wriglesworth, a financial analyst at the stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew. In theory, Abbey became a bank in July 1989, when it abandoned its sta- tus as a mutual building society and was floated on the stock exchange. However, Mr Birch decided it should concentrate on serving its traditional building society customers. Indeed, Abbey refused to incorpo- rate the word \"bank\" in its name. \"All market research indicates that con- sumers have a far higher opinion of building societies than of banks,\" said Mr Wriglesworth. So Abbey went out of its way to preserve its old image. The latest research shows that few of its customers are aware that it is no longer a building society, for all the publicity that was given to its conver- sion. That is not to say that becoming a public company brought no advan- tages to Abbey. Flotation endowed it with additional capital, which it exploited in buying Scottish. Abbey also freed itself from some of the con- straints on its ability to expand over- seas and on the range of products it can offer personal customers, which were imposed by the Building Societ- ies Commission, the societies' supervi- sor, to protect society members. By acquiring Scottish, it is emulat- ing two banking rivals Lloyds and TSB group, both of which already own life companies. Lloyds bought a controlling stake in the We company, Abbey Life, three years ago. Since then, Lloyds' life insurance profits have been growing at an annualised rate of 40 per cent. In its results for the six months to June, its life profits after tax and all other charges were Â£52m, 28 per cent of the total TSB has been even more successful, having built its own life business from scratch over the past decade. Mr Peter Elwood, its chief executive in charge of UK retail banking and insurance, said that TSB sells 40 per cent of all life policies bought by its 7m branch customers. The compara- ble figure for Lloyds is 16 per cent, though that has doubled in three years and is still rising fast. The success of TSB bodes well for Abbey. TSB's typical customer is less affluent than the average bank cus- tomer and lacking in financial exper- tise. Unlike more prosperous consum- ers, they do not tend to shop around for insurance policies. They buy from TSB because they trust it. Abbey's customer base is similar. Until now, Abbey has been selling the life policies of Friends Provident on an exclusive basis. Most banks and building societies sell policies on the basis of similar \"tied\" contracts with insurers. However, in these cases, the banks are forced to share profits with the insurance company. Mr Wrigles- worth estimates that Abbey currently receives Â£30m of commission income from the 100,000 policies it sells every year for Friends Provident. By manu- facturing the insurance products with Scottish Mutual, its net income should almost double at a stroke. Mr Elwood says a second advantage in owning a life insurer, rather than dealing with one on a contractual basis, is that it is helpful to put the life business under a single manage- ment team. There is a big cultural difference between a typical life salesman and a typical bank manager. In a nutshell, bankers are not salesmen by nature. So Lloyds Abbey Life and TSB have been trying to nurture more of a sales culture within their branches. Mr Don McCrickard, the chief executive of TSB Group, said that the integration of the life company and the bank branches has gone further at TSB than at any other bank, simply because it has been in the business longest and created its own life com- pany in its own image, rather than having to adapt a purchased business. However, the binding of Abbey and Scottish Mutual should be relatively smooth because the two share a com- mon inheritance as mutual societies. Indeed, Abbey wants to preserve Scot- tish's mutual image. Though Abbey dropped the words \"building society\" from its name, it wants Scottish to trade as Scottish Mutual Assurance plc. Abbey is learning all the retailers' sleights of hand.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Lapper on the problems of small mutual insurers emutualisation - the process by which an insurer owned by policyholders is transformed into a limited liability company - is likely to become an increasingly important part of the British life insurance scene. By agreeing to Abbey National's takeover, Scottish Mutual becomes the third of the UK's 20-plus mutual- ly-owned insurers to have embarked on demutualisation since 1989. More than 75 per cent of the com- pany's policyholders need to vote in favour of the deal - already agreed by the board - for it to go ahead. If, as expected, it does, many smaller mutuals could follow suit. Bigger mutual insurers, such as Standard Life and Norwich Union, are likely to remain unaffected. Indeed, they rank among the biggest of Britain's business success stories over the past 25 years. But the picture is different for their smaller counterparts. These companies have been handicapped, not so much by their inability to raise capital on the Stock Exchange as by a weakness that has little to do with their constitutional status: their dependence on independent interme- diaries or financial advisers (the so-called IFA market), usually high street brokers, to sell their products. While many of the most successful life companies of the 1970s and 1980s were developing their own direct sales forces (like Allied Dunbar), most mutuals stayed loyal to the IFA market which was dealt a heavy blow by the 1986 Financial Services Act. To be licensed as independent intermediaries, brokers have had to meet stiff compliance tests, increas- ing their costs and forcing many to develop exclusive ties with bigger Insurance companies. The number of intermediaries has shrunk, making it more difficult for many mutuals to increase the size of their business. This was one of the main reasons w-hy a small Glasgow-based insurer, FS Assurance, now renamed Britan- nia Life, opted to demutualise in 1989. According to Mr Peter Burdon, its managing director: \"Our mutual status made us unattractive to any -potential partners.\" Britannia Build- ing Society eventually paid Â£14m for it in January 1990. Observers believe that it is only a matter of time before many of the smaller mutuals in the UK's highly- fragmepted life insurance market take the same route. \"Life has become difficult for small-to-medium-sized mutuals since the FSA and it is possible that some of them will run for cover,\" says Mr David Nisbet, life insurance analyst with County NatWest in Edinburgh. \"If I were head of a small or medi- um-sized mutual company with new business flat I would have to look at any possible deal very seriously.\" Mr Douglas Patrick, chief executive of Scottish Mutual, insists the deal \"has been taken in the best interests of pollcyholders. The loss of owner- ship is sensitive and delicate, but members will be fairly compensated\". Abbey National will pay Â£285m into the Scottish Mutual's life fund - out of which bonuses are paid each year to policyholders. Policyholders will receive a special one-off bonus, roughly equivalent to 25 per cent of the consideration. The remainder of the money will help guarantee the value of future pay-outs. Mr Nisbet says: \"It's a good deal for policyholders. Bonus levels are enhanced and in the longer term the merger will help keep expense levels down and enhance the security of policyholders' investments.\" Nevertheless approval will not be automatic. A circular is to be mailed to the company's 300,000 policy- holders - of which about 175,000 with-profits policyholders are eligible to vote - in early October, when the implications for individuals will become clear. Scottish Mutual will convene a special general meeting in early November. A court of session hearing will be held in December, before the final completion date, expected to be January 1 1992.",

   "text_content" : "By Samuel Brittan T here could jot have been a bet- ter eample of the low level of British partisan debate than the Labour attack on the governor of the Dank of EnglandrMr Robin Leigh- Peuberton, for saying: J am fit- deit we are now coming out of reces- sion.\" When people like the governor say that the UK is coming out of reces- sion, they merely mean that after four sharply falling quarters output is likely to rise' in the final quarters of 1991. Does the opposition really have to claim that output is set on a course of non-stop decline to make out a case against the government? Economic growth is a normal feature of a mod- em economy. Are Labour's own aspi- rations so impoverished that it has to fear any recovery, however incom- plete, as a triumph for Conservative policy? The governor's main purpose was not to celebrate an upturn, but to read a lecture to all political parties about the dangers of trying to speed up growth by taking risks with infla- tion. The novel ingredient lost in the headline reports was the attempt to spell out more precisely what is wrong with tolerating inflation. (The speech-writer's problem is that the dangers of inflation, like any other risky course, are open-ended; and any Are Labour's own aspirations so impoverished that it has to fear an incomplete recovery as a triumph for Conservative policy? enumeration is likely to omit some of the effects most likely to be harmful next time round.) The clinching evidence that reces- sion is ending is provided by the CBI monthly trends survey, which has proved more accurate than most for- mal forecasts. During the worst of the gloom in February, 36 per cent more business respondents expected output to fall than to rise in the coming four months. This negative balance has now disappeared. The survey last had this configuration in 1981 on the eve of recovery from the previous deep recession. The composition of the trade fig- ures also points to recovery. Export volume has been rising relative to import volume for some time, as the accompanying Teenagers' Guide dem- onstrates. But whereas in the four months, January to April, the improvement came from falling imports and exports were stagnant, in the four months, May to August, imports have started to rise moder- ately, but exports have been increas- ing considerably faster. The results so far are not bad going for a period of almost stagnant world output and trade, and hardly suggest an overvalued pound. Further point- ers to recovery are the rise in imports of capital goods and the sharp turn- round in industrial .construction orders. The most bullish domestic sac- tor is the return of consumer confi- dence; the most bearish factors are the continued depression of the hous- ing market and the high level of cor- porate as well as personal indebted- ness. The main underlying reason for caution about the speed of the recov- ery is, however, a nagging doubt about the firmness of world activity - a doubt nourished, but not settled, by the sluggishness of world money supply growth. The aspect of the present UK turn- round which is spectacularly better than its predecessors is the way that inflation has been hit on the head. Indeed, a very slight majority of CBI respondents now expect prices to fall. Consumer prices will still, of course, creep upwards because of increases in the costs of services, food and public utilities. But it is nevertheless the first time since the CBI monthly inquiry began 16 years ago that it has failed to find a majority of industrial- ists expecting to increase their prices. The present depressed level of price expectations was not seen even dur- ing the oil price collapse of 1985-86. There has, of course, been a high cost to pay in terms of lost output and jobs. The cost will continue to mount, despite \"recovery\". The key forces at work are shown in the chart, which repays a little pondering. The chart is unusual in plotting the level of real gross domestic product, rather than increases and decreases. This feature gives it an undramatic gently upward-sloping shape. Quite a severe recession is represented by a gentle dip. The trend line passes through the first quarter of 1987 and the last quar- ter of 1990. In both these quarters, the Treasury estimates output to have been on trend (to be pedantic, it was 0.8 per cent below on each occasion). The best official guess is that the UK TRADM TrNAGOW' GUIDE (axo. o and am\"arrae) Year Imports Exports 1986 +7.1 +2.4 1987 +8.8 +7.6 1988 +14.6 +4.4 1989 +7.4 +9.2 1990 +0.2 +7.4 1991 Jan-April* -5.2 +0.9 1991 May-Aug* +2.6 +8.2 Over previous tour month annualled Source: CSO 40 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 -40 1965- 120 115 110 105 100 100 The output GAP PS, Ce Balance of ups over downs 95 .. 86 87 88 89 90 91 92a a_ Ii a 1985 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 D.. - Ige5r 120 115 110 105 100 trend rate of growth of non-North Sea output is 2% per cent per annum, and of total output 2% per cent. The two benchline quarters were also ones when the economy was believed to have been running at normal capac- ity. rates. This does not mean the maximum of which the economy was physically capable, but the maximum sustainable without rising inflation. Because of lags, unemployment rates were very different during the two quarters in question. Employers take time both to hire workers when output starts to rise above trend and to fire them when it begins to fall below it. If one averages the two near- trend quarters, the unemployment rate turns out to have been about 8% per cent. This is almost exactly the Nairu - the unemployment rate con- sistent with non-accelerating inflation - estimated by Richard Layard and his co-authors for the UK in their weighty new study.* The shaded area shown in the lower chart represents the \"Gap between Actual and Potential\" output - or \"GAP\" as it used to be known in the US. Even though the economy may be technically in recovery, it will still be experiencing depressed activity. The GAP between actual and potential output is officially expected to carry on increasing until the first half of 1992. It will not, if the Treasury is right, begin to close until after the end of the forecast period and after the last possible date for the next election. By then, output will on offi- cial expectations be some 3% to 4 percentage points below trend. Put that way, it may seem modest; but if translated directly into employ- ment, it means something like a mil- lion fewer jobs. Even allowing for the disappearance of some job losers from the labour market this is likely to take the unemployment total within spitting distance of 3m; and in view of the lags already mentioned, it is diffi- cult to see any levelling off until far into 1992. Of course, the government's advis- ers did not plan their strategy in terms of these particular numbers. But the development of the GAP has not been just due to ineptitude, fore- casting errors, or \"not caring\". A sub- stantial output shortfall has been nec- essary to reduce inflation from the underlying annual rate of 7 per cent to 8 per cent it reached in 1990 to something nearer the French and Ger- man rate of 3 per cent to 4 per cent. The Treasury and Bank of England have Justified their earlier delay in reducing base rates in their normal obscure way. But the true justifica- tion has been the need to create a Margin of slack and a depressed labour market to do what they call \"bearing down on inflation.\" The extent of the downward pressure depends both on the size of the GAP and the rate at which it is widening or narrowing. Once both actual infla- tion and inflationary expectations are down to acceptably low rates, the GAP can be gradually eliminated and output return to its trend line. The point of the chart is to show the forces at work: the projected num- bers are merely illustrations. The slope of the trend line and its position are both controversial. Above an, no one can know beforehand the precise degree of slack required to reduce inflation by a given amount and the length of time the slack will need to persist. This ignorance is not just a deficiency of econometric technique. For these variables depend on chang- ing human beliefs and expectations: for instance on the policy regime believed to be in operation and the resolve with which this or some future government will stick to it. They are thus not even in principle calculable. Governments therefore need to avoid like the plague trying to target output and employment directly. There has been a need to create a margin of slack and a depressed labour market to bring down inflation near to Franco-German levels Wishful-thinking attempts to do so led to the mistakes of the 1960s and early 1970s. Governments need to formulate macroeconomic policy in terms of a \"nominal framework\". Ideally this should embrace a national exchange- rate objective, such as maintaining the ERM parity and a goal for Nomi- nal GDP at Group of' Seven or EC level. It is this latter which is so clearly the missing element that will not be supplied at the forthcoming international meetings. But there is much unfinished busi- ness at the purely domestic level for the next few parliaments. There is an obvious need to reduce the severity and length of the output depressions required to reverse inflationary epi- sodes. (If anyone tries to tell you that the inflationary episode of the late 1980s will never recur, just tell him he is whistling in the dark.) An even more important piece of unfinished business is to raise not so much the growth rate, but the posi- tion of the trend line, so that inflation can stabilise with less economic slack and with unemployment at below the present estimated 8'/ per cent equilib- rium rate. Such a rate would have been regarded as unthinkably high at any time between 1940 and 1980, and is far too high a price to pay for the national dislike of market-clearing pay levels. *Unemployment.

   "text_content" : "'rom iMr Onesimo Alvarez Moro. Sir, The experts from the University of St Andrews (Letters, September 21) seem to believe that setting aside sp- ial1 lanes for taxis and public transport will solve the traffic congestion problem. Their solution sounds so easy that I am surprised the UK authori- lies have not thought of it before. Unfortunately, Madriu, which already has this system in place, is not one of those European cities which has suc- ceeded in making it work. doubt that any exists. While there may be some small benefit - as with many nargtnal solutions - in a spe ial ane, relatively few people coaider public transport as a valid alternative. Public trans- port in Madrid, except during the very limited peak periods, sually has plenty of room. The roads, however, are foll of traffic either trying to get somewhere or trying to :nd a parking space when they even- tually arrive. It has recently been estimated that in the very centre of Madrid, 20 per cent of the traffic at any time is looking for a parking space. Let's face it, while the car maintains its status as a pro- tected species and while the marginal cost of using a car is almost nil, people are going to ignore the alternatives. We owe it to our planet and to ourselves to charge the real cost of the ready use of cars. We all know the costs, Including pollution, both air and noise, the delays, the ner- vous breakdowns, the incivil- ity, the cost to industry of delayed deliveries, and on and on. Let drivers who want the luxury of causing all these things pay for the privilege of doing so. O Alvarez-Moro, PUfoes 2 Lperta 2b01s Mdordh Spam",

Sir, It is clear from your story \"Treasury seeks to cut Â£lbn from budget for training\" (September 24), that training and business development are not connected in the minds of government ministers. They see no link with increasing effi- ciency, improving performance or raising quality standards. No. Training is expedient. It keeps people off the streets. When you can afford it, cut it! What kind of example is that? Especially to leaders of indus- try who, with a cash flow dry- ing up, still keep the vision that training, well directed, will bring us all a brighter future. Irrational and chilling Is the official retort: Haggling like this is \"normal\" at this time of year. Around every man, woman or youth who needs training there is a cluster of people, involved and concerned: the spouse, the parent, the employer, the trainer. Do they think it's \"normal\"?

   "text_content" : "Is the deprivation which remains in Britain's increasingly wealthy soci- ety avoidable? Must income distribution become more unequal to create economic success? These are trouble- some questions, particularly after the recent riots on Tyne- side housing estates where fewer than one in five adults is in work and young adults have little stake in the enterprise society. They are also questions sel- dom raised by politicians, unless turbulent priests stir things up. Yet there remains a big minority for whom inner- city decay, poverty and hope- lessness are part of everyday experience. They are people who often lack access to basic human requirements such as a home of their own, adequate heat and clothing. They experi- ence pain, an uncomfortable word used by David Donnison to describe \"avoidable and cur- able suffering\". The ideology which has pro- vided the framework for tack- ling such concerns - socialism - is on the skids. The failures of its distant offspring in east- ern Europe have knocked the stuffing out of those who would use state power for egal- itarian ends. Even those par- ties of the left which remain in power in countries such as Spain espouse policies little dif- ferent from those of conserva- tive governments in countries such as Germany. In the UK, this historic decline of socialism coincides with Neil Kinnock's efforts to rehabilitate the Labour party's fortunes through a process of ceaseless revisionism. Clause four of the'party constitution, still printed on every member- ship card, calls for \"the most equitable distribution... possi- ble\" of \"the full fruits\" of the industry of \"workers by hand or by brain\". Labour's policy review - with the worthy slo- gan of \"social justice and eco- nomic efficiency\" - contains little to achieve this and still less for those who are denied the opportunity to work by hand or brain. Donnison, an academic and adviser to Labour governments in the 1960s and 1970s, is clearly angry at the failure on the left to create \"a bank of humane, tested, reforming ideas\" that would deal with the A RADICAL AGENDA: AFTER THE NEW RIGHT AND THE OLD LEFT By David Donnison Rivers Oram Press, Â£9.95 most intractable problems. His book is an attempt to formu- late a radical philosophy to address these issues, one which could win support from those not suffering deprivation but uneasy about what they see happening. Although from the \"old left\" intellectual tradition, Donnison has read enough of the \"new right\" critique of welfarism to offer some genuinely radical insights. He identifies the iron tendency of professional ser- vice-providers to create struc- tures, hierarchies and priori- ties which create a dependent underclass: \"... . every study of the matter tends to show that a large part of the huge increase in funds devoted to social services since the second world war has been used to make life better for their staff rather than to improve the ser- vice delivered to customers\". He insists that problems are best sorted out by those on the receiving end, who must be given the power as well as the resources to meet their own needs. The private sector and voluntary agencies have a role to play at least as important as civic leaders, if only to provide choice for those who currently do not enjoy it. It is a radical version of the Citizen's Char- ter, which insists on respon- sive public services not because well-heeled taxpayers demand them, but because those services will not relieve pain if they do not meet the needs of those they are aimed at. Some of Donnison's concep- tions seem dated - an incomes policy for example. But his willingness to ask difficult questions and to consider radi- cal solutions - discarded or novel - is refreshing and not a little disconcerting. Delegates to next week's Labour party conference should pack a copy to browse through during the interminable debates on trade union immunities and rena- tionalising utilities. John Willman",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson in Moscow )~~_Â·_ r_ V_ ~_i~I_ L__-_L-- Â·Â·- tÂ·u- a~^u-- -L-l----- RUSSIA's lumbering banking system has taken two tentative steps towards modernity, by introducing a domestic charge card and unveiling $1.5bn (Â£860m) plans to computerise operations at the republic's biggest bank. NCR, the US computer group recently taken over by AT&T, has signed an agreement with the Russian government and its Russian Savings Bank to automate the bank's 40,000 branches. The agreement would also computerise the communica- tions network of the bank, which handles 124m accounts, and would give it modern banking services, including automated teller machines. The restructuring will take several years, according to Mr Rainer Liebich, managing director of NCR Osteuropa, the German-based arm of the group which has already won banking contracts in Poland and Czechoslovakia. Mr Liebich said the aim would be to take the Russian Savings Bank directly from its centralised system to the most modern, personal computer- based system. Much of the $1.5bn cost estimate is based on supplying 100,000 ter- a minals to the bank's branches. i g Financing has yet to; be arranged and Mr Liebich spid 1 e NCR would solicit backing r from the World Bank and the g European Bank for Reconstruc- i e tion and Development as part i e of a package he hoped would a be complete by February. I A further step towards a i Russian banking revolution a will be taken today by Credo- i a bank, a private Moscow bank, i s when it announces the Soviet i t Union's first Visa charge card, 1 - largely for Russians travelling 1 e abroad on business. s The card will be exclusively i - for hard currency payments. 4 Prospective cardholders, of which! Credobank believes there will be more than 1,000, will have to provide a deposit of $5,000. Payment will be made by direct debit from the clients' hard currency accounts, which have been legal for Russian citizens for only a matter of months. In tandem with Credobank's announcement, Intourservice, an independent company spun off from Intourist, the state tourism organisation, said yes- terday it would introduce a 24- hour, fully automated credit card authorisation service from October 1. Mr Igor Fedorov, chairman of Intourservice, said the two developments were a necessary step towards a market system. \"We see our role as setting up a model of the new systems and technology which will be a school for future credit cards in Soviet roubles.\" However, Mr Toby Mitchell, Visa area manager for the Soviet Union, said a roubles card was some years off. This was partly for reasons of scale and difficulties of convertibil- ity, but the greatest impedi- ments were suspicions about plastic cards and the lack of an efficient service culture.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston BRITISH COMPANIES will for the first time be forced to give reliable information on the amount of cash they are generating. The move follows today's publication of the first Sinan- cial Reporting Standard to be issued by the Accounting Stan- dards Board. ASB was set up earlier this year to overhaul UK accounting standards. Professor David Tweedie, ASB chairman, said its first Financial Reporting Standard, on cash flow statements, was the most important of all the rules it would be issuing. \"A cash flow statement gives a guide to the quality of a com- pany's profits,\" he said. \"Prof- its are not necessarily a reli- able measure of a company's performance. Companies can adjust profits to suit their own purposes by using provisions.\" He said cash flow statements were particularly useful to shareholders during a reces- sion. A series of companies, most notably Polly Peck and Brent Walker, have run into severe financial difficulties only months after reporting record profits. If these companies had pro- duced cash flow statements, ASB hopes, shareholders would have learnt that their core operations were consum- ing, not generating, cash. The new cash flow state- ments will appear in compa- nies' accounts in place of state- ments on the source and application of funds. FRS 1 is superseding Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 10. All accounts for periods end- ing on or after March 23 1992 must contain the new informa- tion, but ASB is encouraging companies reporting results earlier than this to include the new statement. ASB is dropping SSAP 10 for two main reasons: * Funds statements gave too little information on the source of cash. * The rules on the drafting of funds statements were not rigid enough. Companies inter- preted them in different ways, rendering meaningful compari- sons between the accounts of different companies was diffi- cult. ASB plans to tackle four con- troversial issues in the coming year * How companies account for goodwill. * Accounting for intangible fixed assets. * How companies incorporate the accounts of acquired busi- nesses in their own accounts. * How companies value the assets of businesses they acquire.

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith THE EXPULSION of all Mili- tant supporters is highlighted in a poll published today as the move most likely to help Labour win the next election. The findings are published within hours of Labour taking action against two MPs, Mr Terry Fields and Mr Dave Nel- list, who were suspended yes- terday from holding office in the party because of alleged links with Militant. The survey also shows that a bill of rights is seen as a way for both Labour and the Tories to increase their support signif- icantly, while attracting mini- mal extra unpopularity. The Mori report for the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust measured how parties could enhance electoral chances by constitutional reforms as against other policies. A tough stand by Mr John Major on Europe against his I party's right wing was seen as . positive for his election i chances: only 5 per cent of respondents thought it would hamper the Tories' prospects. Stopping more NHS hospi- tals opting for trust status was i most cited - 54 per cent - as benefiting the Tories, but 15 per cent thought it would make them less popular. For Labour, standing up to the unions on seeking to improve quality of public ser- vices scored almost as well as expelling Militants as a cost- free way to gain support. Increasing the tax on petrol by a penny a litre to pay for environmental policies was seen as a popular move for the Liberal Democrats by 46 per cent, but just under 20 per cent said it would cost votes. But the party's pro-European stance has limited voter appeal - only 18 per cent believed it would help the party. A Mori poll for the Electoral Reform Society found that 35 per cent said Labour would be more likely to win the election if it were committed to propor- tional representation for all elections, with only 8 per cent saying it would make Labour less popular. * The Tories have lost the votes of many GPs following the NHS reforms, according to a survey in today's issue of Doctor magazine. Although GPs are traditionally Tory vot- ers, a third of 700 questioned said they would vote Liberal Democrat, a fifth Labour and only a quarter Conservative. Nellist may fight, Page 10",

   "text_content" : "The replacement of Sir Roland Smith by Sir Graham Day at the head of British Aerospace looks the best available solu- tion to an increasingly embar- rassing problem. From the viewpoint of BAe's owners, the issue is simple. During Sir Roland's tenure, BAe's share price has fallen by a quarter against the market. Granted, the fall has taken place wholly within the past month. But the City is an unforgiving place these days, especially when the begging bowl is being passed round. Sir Graham's temporary appointment seems admirably suited to BAe's most pressing problem - the successful sale of Â£432m worth of new equity. He has two basic qualifica- tions: he is used to dealing with officialdom and he knows about motor cars. In the longer term, there is a more formidable managerial challenge which has yet to be addressed. In its present form, BAe is a rag-bag of unfashion- able ideas: defence, property and acquiring privatised assets on the cheap. Sir Roland has been accused of paying too much for Arlington Securities. This misses the point. It was necessary to buy a developer to disguise the profits supposedly to be made from public land bought with Rover, Royal Ord- nance and the rest. None of that strategy has borne fruit. But if the rest of BAe's man- agement had a better idea at the time, we have yet to hear about it. Abbey National The attraction of Abbey National has always been its reluctance to squander its spare cash on grandiose acqui- sitions. Yesterday's relatively modest deal with Scottish Mutual shows it is determined not to stray from this virtuous path, even as it diversifies into insurance. The deal should dilute earnings only margin- ally in the short run; but it creates a new and potentially ample source of qualify earn- ings for the medium term. One could quibble about the Â£285m price tag, which involves Â£65m in goodwill. But even if Abbey has erred on the generous side, it is paying a far lower premium than would have been needed to acquire a proprietary company. More- over, it would always have needed to buy in expertise to have its own life operation up and running in time for the severance of its agency link with Friends Provident in: 1993. Under the new arrangement, Scottish Mutual will continue FMg Zbk Shan FT-A 200 180 160 140 120 100 Source t0 Cd throl pend marl will ent's the 1 mud earn Abbe with some tish: have startÂ· tion. ket's ing ii cent Mu Un worii of b adva were mudl the ment sible out sban those fort justi: have well in in oped instil De new Pioni Life brani the I navii rent the 1 Mutu ticuli theq will taini: same to ha into FT-8E Index: 2,597.8 (+21.2) Abbey National Share price relative to the FT-A Banks Index Jul'89 1990 1991 Source: Oaatreat to distribute its products through the up-market inde- pendent financial advisers' market. Abbey National Life will operate through its par- ent's branch network. In time, the latter is likely to make a much larger contribution to earnings. For the moment Abbey will have to make do with an annual contribution of some Â£20m to Â£30m from Scot- tish Mutual, while it will also have to bear the modest start-up costs of its life opera- tion. On that basis, the mar- ket's knee-jerk reaction in driv- ing its shares up by over 4 per cent was a trifle overdone. Mutuals Until fairly recently in the world of insurance, the virtues of being Scottish and the advantages of being mutual were taken for granted in much the same way north of the border. From manage- ment's perspective, it was pos- sible to take a long view with- out the twin distractions of shareholders and predators. To those who said this bred com- fort and complacency, it was justly pointed out that mutuals have collectively performed well over the last 25 years and in individual cases have devel- oped into major UK financial institutions. Demutualisation is not a new concept. FS Assurance, Pioneer and National Mutual Life of Australasia's UK branch have blazed a trail in the UK, not to mention Scandi- navian examples and the cur- rent case of Equitable Life of the US. Yesterday's Scottish Mutual deal, though, looks par- ticularly symbolic and revives the question of whether others will go the same way. Cer- tainly, most mutuals face the same pressures which appear to have driven Scottish Mutual into the arms of Abbey s I t I t r 1 I I C I 1 L L L I I I I 1 r L r National, notably the break up of established patterns of dis- tribution in the wake of the Financial Services Act. That forced many hitherto indepen- dent financial advisers to tie themselves to a single com- pany, with inevitable conse- quences for those which had previously relied on their busi- ness. Many medium sized mutuals in particular have been slow to respond to the challenge, lack- ing the determination as well as the capital to build up new outlets. Building societies pro- vide obvious partners, as rela- tionships like the one between the Halifax and Standard Life suggest. But whether yester- day's deal with a building soci- ety turned bank signals a more general pattern of takeovers is more doubtful, given that only a handful of societies have sus- ficient free capital. Friendly bids for mutuals from conti- nental insurers are more likely, not least because quoted candidates like Britannic, Ref- uge, and London & Manchester will hardly roll over without an expensive fight. Vodafone Unlike its twin Racal Elec- tronics, Vodafone has not required a bid since the demer- ger 10 days ago to launch its shares into orbit. In that time, Vodafone shares have risen by 16 per cent while the FT-SE index has fallen by 1 per cent. The performance is the more curious since by any measure except that of other interna- tional mobile phone operators, the shares were already on a healthy rating, despite having lagged the market for more than a year. At yesterday's price of 387p, the multiples for this year and next of 23 and 21 rank among the highest in the FT-SE. The question is how Voda- sone should be valued in the short term. The immediate case of Tuesday's paper bid by Bell Atlantic of the US for the indebted Metro Mobile sug- gests a method based on the potential subscriber base. On that basis, Vodafone would be very cheap. But it would also suggest a Â£7bn price tag for a company which, by its own admission, will be generating a mere Â£2bn of revenues by the end of the millenium. One view sees Vodafone as temporarily stuck in a rut at the tail end of the economic cycle. Subscribers taken on now will make little contribu- tion to profits next year. That lag makes the outlook rather more sluggish than the current share price suggests.",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group and second-largest UK mortgage lender, is to enter the life assurance market. It is buying Scottish Mutual, a medium-sized Glasgow-based mutual life assurance company, for Â£285m and will then set up a new life assurance company, Abbey National Life, to sell life assurance policies to Abbey National's 7m customers. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey National chief executive, said yesterday he expected Abbey National Life to become rapidly established in the life assurance market after it gets under way in 1998. \"We needed to acquire a mutual but at the same time build our own life assurance operation,\" he said. Setting up the life assurance will cost Â£65m on top of the price for Scottish Mutual. The purchase, negotiated over many months by Kleinwort Ben- son, Abbey's merchant bank, involves the biggest demutualisa- tion of a life assurance company in the UK. It must be approved by at least 75 per cent of Scottish Mutual's policyholders at an extraordinary general meeting in November and be confirmed by a court hearing in Scotland in December. Yesterday Abbey National said it expected some opposition to the proposals from Scottish Mutual policy-holders but was confident it would win approval. About a quarter of the Â£285m purchase price will finance a one- off bonus to the qualifying Scot- tish Mutual members. The rest will be paid into Scottish Mutu- al's funds to support the level of future bonuses for existing poli- cy-holders. About Â£65m of the Â£285m price represents goodwill for the purchase of Scottish Mutual's business. Scottish Mutual will continue to operate as a separate life assurance company inside the Abbey National Group, selling its policies through brokers. Mr Birch said Abbey National had talked to a number of insur- ance companies before selecting Scottish Mutual, partly on grounds of price, but also because the two shared a vision for the future of the financial ser- vices industry. Abbey National will set up its own 500-strong sales force which will sell policies from the new Abbey National Life through its branches and estate agency chain to the bank's customers. The deal means the end of the tie between Abbey National and Friends Provident, the large mutual life assurance company whose products it has been sell- ing since early in 1988. However, Abbey National will not make the change until 1993 at the earli- est and Mr Birch said yesterday that Abbey National would rec- ommend Friends Provident prod- ucts until then. Abbey National's shares closed at 306p yesterday, up 13p. Takeover habit, Page 24 Lex, Page 26",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller THE SHARE price of Lep Group, the security and distribution con- cern which is 27 per cent owned by ADT, stabilised at 27p yester- day after falling from 87p to 20p this week. The group said it had signed a credit agreement with 23 of its 30 banks, led by National Westmin- ster. Mr John East, chief execu- tive, was confident the remaining seven would come into line. Mr East said Lep had been heading for breaches of its loan covenants, which had been suspended during 2% months of talks with the banks. Net debt rose from Â£400m to Â£470m in the first six months, although just over half of this was exchange-rate effects. Oper- ating profit fell to Â£20.1m (Â£23.3m) and the cost of managing joint property ventures knocked off a further Â£1.lm to give Â£19m profit covering Â£17.1m of interest pay- ments. Interim pre-tax profit fell from Â£10.4m to Â£1.9m on sales of Â£749.1m (Â£740.2m) and the divi- dend was passed. Lep said full- year profit would be less than half last year's Â£29.4m. The group said a Â£20m extraor- dinary provision for losses on US property might be made at the year-end.

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington and Richard Waters in London SECURITIES companies in several leading financial centres could be forced to increase the capital tied up in their busi- nesses, following a tentative agreement between international securities regulators. One British regulator said the agreement could add \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" to the cap- ital needed by London-based bro- kers and dealers. The agreement, representing a majority view of national regula- tors meeting under the auspices of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (losco), aims to impose minimum capital ratios on all securities companies. Under the proposal, dealers would have to hold capital amounting to 8 per cent of their gross equity positions and 4 per cent of their net positions, ate taking account of offsetting hold- ings such as futures and options. France, Japan and the UK have expressed strong reservations about these figures, which they believe exaggerate the risks in holding a diversified portfolio of liquid equities, and argue that different ratios are needed to reflect the varying volatility of different markets. They claim the 4 per cent rule is unnecessarily high for net posi- tions, which carry only minimal risk, and that the required capi- tal backing should be 2 per cent. The higher figure is under- stood to have been insisted on by the US, which earlier this year helped to block an losco proposal it considered too lax. US regula- tors say the 4 and 8 per cent rule would be looser than the stan- dards currently applied to US broking firms. In spite of the disagreement, the latest paper is the furthest losco has moved on the subject of capital adequacy in three years of discussions. \"One thing there is unanimity on is that we cannot have regula- tory arbitrage between different countries,\" said one US securities regulator. Work is under way to lessen the impact of the high minimum ratios in countries with less strin- gent capital regimes. losco is expected to meet the Basle committee of bank supervi- sors in the next few weeks to hammer out agreement on the assessment of securities risks for securities companies and banks. losco has accepted, with reluc- tance, the Basle committee's \"building block approach\" to gauging the capital that compa- nies need to match their risks.",

   "text_content" : "Tracy Corrigan reports on the EBRD's successful first borrowing EBRD president Jacques Attali argues that money is only part of the solution to eastern Europe's problems IuLc Photo: Tony Andrews I wo years after it was first conceived, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has started to borrow the resources it will need to finance the economic regenera- tion of eastern Europe. Yesterday, the bank made its first offering in the international capital markets, raising Ecu 500m from an issue of five-year bonds which was sold out almost imme- diately. Indeed, because of the bank's relatively small funding needs, the paper is likely to have an extra rarity value. Mr Jacques Attall, EBRD presi dent, welcomed the bank's first issue, which successfully lays the groundwork for its future bor rowing plans. The EBRD needs to borrow, even though it is sitting on Ecu 600m (Â£422m) of paid-in capital. The bank's capital, provided by member countries, serves to cre ate an extremely credit-worthy bank, and is not primarily intended for lending purposes. Only equity investments will be made from capital. The bank's Triple-A credit rat- ing allows it to raise debt in the international markets at favoura ble terms. The capital markets will be the primary source of .funds, which theabank will then lend on, charging a margin. The EBRD is expected to be a profitable bank. \"We are not -a profit-maximising but a profit- guided institution. We do not dis- tribute dividends, but we do need to show strength in our financial structure,\" said Mr Rend Kar- senti, the EBRD's treasurer, who formerly held the same job at the International Finance Corpora- tion, the World Bank's private sector finance arm. The bank has now completed four loans to projects in eastern Europe. The first, approved in late June, was to Poland's Bank of Poznan for a heat supply proj ect. The most recent financings, announced this week, include a DMlOm (Â£2.9m) loan to PetGfi Nyomda, a recently privatised packaging company and an Ecu 81.7m agency line to finance a small and medium size enter- prises, in a joint venture with si with NMB Postbank. A $10m E (Â£5.70m) equity investment in the si Czechoslovakia Investment Cor- I poration, a country fund dedi- b cated to small and medium size o enterprises, was also announced i: last week. s THE EBRD'S PROSPKCTIVE BORROWRS Population GNP per Debt (mllions) capita ($) ($bn) Bulgaria 9.0 1,112 10.8 Czechoslovakia 15.6 2,794 8.1 Hungary 10.5 3,011 21.3 Poland 37.0 1,595 41.6 Romania 23.3 1,393 0.5 Yugoslavia 23.3 5,008 60.0 USSR 286.0 4,287 60.0 Source: Morgan Guaranty Trust Around 200 more projects are in the pipeline. Nevertheless, yes- terday's Ecu 500m issue of five- year bonds will provide for much of the bank's lending needs in the next year or so. The current bor- rowing programme is to raise Ecu 800m by the end of 1992. The Ecu 500m deal was primar- ily designed to establish a bench- mark issue, and so promote a strong investor base for future issues. But the advance funding also carries financial benefits. In this particular instance, the fixed-rate Ecu liabilities of the Ecu 500m deal were swapped into floating-rate dollars, Ecu, and D-Mark liabilities at a margin below the London interbank offered rate. The proceeds of the issue are then invested in short-term instruments, paying a higher rate of interest. Conse- quently there is a \"positive carry\" - the bank is able to earn a margin on the funds before dis- bursement. \"We cannot afford to do an issue that would then cost us money to hold,\" said Mr Anders Ljungh, EBRD vice-presi- dent for finance. The larger dollar and Ecu por- tions were swapped at better than 20 basis points below the London interbank offered rate, significantly more attractive terms than could have been achieved by funding initially in fixed-rate dollars. The EBRD's treasury has decided to have three pools of funds, because of early indica- tions of demand for dollars, Ecu and D-Marks. Borrowers can choose which (convertible) cur- rency, and which interest rate basis - fixed or floating - to take. The EBRD is encouraging borrowers to match the currency in which it borrows to the hard currency in which it is best able to generate income, so that expo- sure to currency fluctuations is reduced. For the moment, the bank's liq- uid funds are conservatively invested in Ecu deposits with banks rated single-A and above, but the bank plans to diversify into securities and other money market instruments. The bank also intends to enter the \"repo\" (repurchase agree- ment) market, where it will lend its securities to other institutions for a fee. Mr Karsenti believes the EBRD is well placed to take advantage of the growth of the Ecu repo market, in particular. Next, the EBRD's treasury will start to use derivative products, in order to have the \"flexibility of futures and options, once we are are satisfied that an adequate risk management system is in place\", said Mr Karsenti. With yesterday's bond offering, the EBRD has successfully estab- lished itself as a presence in the world's capital markets but the real test will come as it lends money to larger projects, when the scale of lending, and the risks, are likely to rise. For Mr Attali, lending is only part of the bank's mission. \"A large part of our role is to influ- ence the west\", he said yesterday. If we succeed in opening western markets [to eastern European exporters], our influence will be much bigger than any financing we could do.\" EBRD debut offer sells out, Page 35",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper IN SPITE OF soft insurance 'rates and falling interest rates, ,Hogg Group, the international 'insurance broking company, yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Â£8.26m in the six months to June 30. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 7.52p (6.96p). The interim dividend is in- creased by 5 per cent to 3.15p (3p). Profits from the core broking business rose by 16 per cent to Â£8.15m (Â£7.04m), after deduc- tion of all interest charges and central costs. Turnover rose to Â£55.9m (Â£47.8m) and expenses to Â£51.7m (Â£44.4m). Investment income fell marginally to Â£3.56m (Â£3.58m). Successful hedging helped Hogg reduce the impact of the decline in the dollar - the group traded at an average rate of $1.69 to the Â£1 and incurred a loss of just Â£100,000 on exchange rate movements. Excluding this loss and the adverse impact of recent acqui- sitions, brokerage income grew at an underlying rate of 9 per cent and expenses by 1 per cent. The group generates about 70 per cent of its brokerage income from lower margin retail business and the remain- der from higher margin but more volatile wholesale trad- ing. Brokerage income grew by 14 per cent in the UK - where the group claims that it is win- ning new business and retains a large quantity of existing business. This was offset by a flat per- formance in the US - where insurance rates remain soft. Over the past 12 months Hogg has acquired JIB Insur- ance Brokers of Australia, two small US brokers - one in Texas, the other in Philadel- phia - and in the UK, the Bris- tol-based WJ Shore. In addition the group has purchased the outstanding minority shareholdings in two reinsurance brokers.",

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto SUBSTANTIAL COST savings helped Johnston Press, the Edinburgh-based publisher and printer, avoid the full impact- of the spreading recession and report an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Â£3.48m to Â£3.88m in the six months to June 30. The shares rose 14p to 285p on the news. Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, warned, however, that market conditions remained difficult. \"The results for the half-year clearly reflect cost savings and good housekeeping rather than any buoyancy in the market- place,\" he said. The increase in profits came on lower turnover of Â£31.3m (Â£31.7m) and a fall in the inter- est charge to Â£42,000 (Â£222,000) due to a sustained improve- ment in liquidity. The results for the group, which publishes 56 newspapers across the UK, reflect the resil- ient performance of the group's newspaper publishing activi- ties in Scotland, where the effects of recession were later in coming. The sharp fall in advertising that was seen throughout the UK last year had a particularly marked effect on the West Sus- sex County Times. Neverthe- less, profits remained satisfac- tory, the company said. West Yorkshire also held up well but the performance in Derbyshire was less satisfac- tory. The performance from the bookbinding and library book- selling business was mixed. Printing and typesetting, however, bore the brunt of the recession and further econo- mies were being implemented. Earnings per 10p share rose to 9.4p (8.5p) and the dividend is increased to 2p (1.75p).",

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto DOMINO PRINTING Sciences, a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial Ink Jet printers, is raising about Â£15.3m net through a 1-for-4 rights issue. News of the issue of 5.08m shares at 310p each triggered a 12p rise in the shares to 398p. The group, which yesterday forecast record sales and prof- itsin the year to October 31, plans to use the proceeds for further expansion in its core ink jet operations and related areas. Full-year pre-tax profits are expected to be at least Â£8.8m, an increase of 44 per cent. The board plans to raise the final dividend by 20 per cent to 4.15p (3.45p), following a 30 per cent increase in the final dividend last year. Trading has been buoyant this year for the group, which is a market leader in Europe. It has seen growth of 29 per cent in Europe, 40 per cent in the Far East and 19 per cent in the US. However, Mr Howard White- smith, managing director, said institutional investors had expressed concern about the risks of the group being a sin- gle-technology business. The jet ink business was 10 years-old and in time supply would begin to outgrow demand, Mr Whitehead pointed out. All five competla tors had put in extra capacity this year. Domino plans to invest fur- ther in its core ink jet technol- ogy to increase market share. It intends to strengthen its world-wide distribution net- work. As new markets for ink jet technology develop, partic- ularly in eastern Europe, the Middle and Far East, there was an increasing need for direct support for distributors, the group said. The group will also move into related business areas, such as machines and inks, which tend to involve high lev- els of goodwill since they are technology-based businesses. Development of new busi- nesses will require additional working capital. It has net borrowings of Elm, but expects to become cash positive in five weeks.",

   "text_content" : "Paul Betts reports on the decision of Professor Sir Roland Smith to quit BAe ROFESSOR Sir Roland Smith made headlines a few years ago when at the height of the takeover bat- tle for the House of Fraser, of which he was chairman, he told Mr Tiny Rowland to \"get your tanks off my lawn\". Yesterday, he was unable to deliver sufficient fire power to save his job as chairman of British Aerospace, the UK's leading defence contractor and one of the biggest manufactur- ing groups. For the past 10 days, Sir Roland had come under heavy attack from within his com- pany as well as from City insti- tutions and his group's trade unions. Although never a popular man inside and outside his company - his independent style of management made him many enemies - he seemed, barely a month ago, securely anchored in his position. However, the momentum for his resignation had become unstoppable after the group badly mishandled the launch of a Â£432m rights issue and stunned the City by announc- ing far worse than expected financial figures. In many respects, he appears to have been made into the scapegoat for BAe's underlying problems and the bungled rights issue. But then, as one City aero- space analyst remarked last night: \"When the ship starts to sink, you always blame the captain.\" Since becoming chairman in 1987, Sir Roland had become rnporary successor, air uranam uay the architect of a sweeping diversification strategy to reduce the group's dependence on defence and commercial avi- ation to transform it into a more broadly based industrial conglomerate. He masterminded the Rover Group car acquisition and sub- sequent purchase of the Arling- ton Securities property con- cern. His vision was to forge big international co-operation agreements between BAe and other leading international groups, including unsuccessful talks with Daimler-Benz, the German car and aerospace company. But this long-term strategy was badly shaken by the reces- sion which hit all of the com- pany's four core businesses at the same time. Ironically, the Gulf war had little impact on the underlying trend of declining defence spending, while it had a pro- found impact on commercial aviation. At the same time, the slump in the UK car and prop- erty markets was far deeper and longer than the company had expected. This has forced the com- pany, which is forecasting pre-tax profits of about Â£150m this year - sharply lower than last year's Â£376m - to accelerate the restructuring programme in its core indus- trial sectors. It has also been forced to launch its rights issue to help finance the costly process of both restructuring and diversifying into civil sec- tors. The problems facing its vari- ous businesses renewed in recent days the criticism of Sir Roland's diversification strat- egy, especially his acquisition of Rover and of Arlington, which was acquired at the top of the property boom. The intention was to use gains from property develop- ment activities to finance the restructuring of the defence, commercial aircraft and car businesses. But Sir Roland's departure is unlikely to alter the short-term predicament facing the com- pany. It is also difficult to see how, at this stage, it can radically change its long-term strategy. BAe is committed to capital- intensive programmes with long lead times, like Airbus or the European Fighter Aircraft. Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive who some say led the campaign to oust Sir Roland, confirmed last week that the group intended to speed up its restructuring and concentrate on its core busi- nesses. However, the group now faces a crisis of confidence in the City as well as, one sus- pects, within itself. Sir Roland did not appear to command great loyalty among his internal ranks. Many were critical of his diversification away from traditional defence and commercial aviation activ- ities, his management style and his extensive portfolio of directorships - including the chairmanship of Manchester United, his favourite football club. With pressure for him to go both from inside the company and from some of its big insti- tutional investors, Sir Roland clearly preferred to bow out rather than risk a bruising bat- tle which would only have undermined both his group's and his own reputation and put at severe risk the Â£432m rights issue. In his office at BAe's head- quarters in the Strand, he keeps a little green cushion which bears the motto: \"No guts, no glory.\" For Sir Roland it probably took more guts to step down from the BAe chair than to fight the putsch against him."

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent ONE OF the minor details that crops up in British Aerospace official documents is that the company owns - through its Rover subsidiary - a half share in a London flat in which Sir Graham Day owns the other half. \"The flat is occupied by Sir Graham without payment to Rover, but he has full responsi- bility for the maintenance and all outgoings,\" one learns. Whether he actually has time ever to lay a weary head there, is not recorded, as he speeds from one job to another through a calendar that can know few equals. The sense of wonderment at his capacity for collecting tasks was already palpable when he was appointed chair- man of PowerGen, the electric- ity generator, last November. And in the space of six days the Prime Minister has invited him to head a new body which will review the pay of teachers in England and Wales, and the board of British Aerospace has turned to him to chair - albeit on a temporary basis - the country's biggest engineering group and leading exporter of manufactured goods. Before the latest appoint- ments Sir Graham was already chairman of three substantial companies - Cadbury-Schwep- pes, Rover (the BAe subsid- iary) and PowerGen. His directorships include Laird Group and Thorn-EMI (both of which he will leave temporarily), DAS, the Dutch truck maker where he is vice- chairman of the supervisory board, BAe itself, and MAI, where he is deputy chairman of the media and insurance group. In Canada he is a non-execu- British Aerospace Share price (pence) Source: Datastream ; tive director of the Bank of Nova Scotia among others. In the UK he is visiting professor and a governor at Kingston Business School, fellow of Uni- versity College Cardiff, mem- ber of the City University Busi- ness School council and governor of Birkenhead School. A member of the National Health Service Policy Board, he has just become president of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. Sir Graham was born in 1933 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Can- ada, the son of a British emi- grant. He graduated as a law- yer from Dalhousie University and arrived in the UK as chief executive of Cammell Laird shipbuilders on Merseyside in 1971, after a seven-year stint with Canadian Pacific. From Cammell Laird he became chief executive of Brit- ish Shipbuilders organising committee in 1975-76, a move he has described as \"my big- gest mistake\". In November 1976 the bill to nationalise the shipbuilding industry failed, and he left for Canada. He returned in 1983, \"to try and salvage what was left of British Shipbuilders,\" this time under a Conservative govern- ment. His two crisis appointments by Mrs Margaret Thatcher - at British Shipbuilders and then in 1986 at British Leyland, subsequently re-named Rover Group, have earned him the reputation as a trouble-shooter, a man to turn to in a time of trouble. BAe is not the first to note this quality. Ahead of schedule he achieved the apparently impos- sible task handed to him by Mrs Thatcher of bringing Rover back into the private sector with its controversial takeover by BAe. The man he had to thank for that success was Professor Sir Roland Smith, the man he has supplanted as BAe chairman.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger PORTER CHADBURN, the leisure, packaging and sporting goods group which markets Head and Gola products, yes- terday launched a Â£20m cash call, announced a further acquisition in the US, and appointed a chief executive to head its growing consumer products division. The rights issue is priced at 65p on the basis of l-for-2 ordi- nary shares and 4-for-5 convert- ible preference shares. The shares closed at 83p, a fall of 6p on the day. Mr Raymond Dinkin, chair- man and chief executive, said the cash call would position the group for further acquisi- tions. \"We believe there are better values and opportunities now than there will be in six to nine months time,\" he said. Ipop, the latest acquisition, was a high margin specialist labelling business based in Connecticut. It was \"a hell of a good buy\" at $3.5m (Â£2m) ini- tially, and maximum deferred payment of $2.5m. In the year to July 31 its profits before interest and tax were $944,000 on turnover of $5.3m. Proceeds from the issue would go towards paying for Ipop and two other recent acquisitions: Adam Leisure, a nursery products and elec- tronic games group which cost Â£500,000, and Jones Custom Products, a Texas based self- adhesive label manufacturer, for which Porter paid $13m. These three companies would boost turnover of the consumer products division, which represented 43 per cent of sa last year.

   "text_content" : ",py Andrew Foster in Hong Kong,,John Murray Brown in Irtanbul and David Barchard in London ,AFTER MONTHS of effort, the 'administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed Iruit and electronics group, ,may finally be poised to gain ,access to the company's .records in northern Cyprus. If confirmed, this is one of ,the most important develop- ,ments in the company's trou- *bled history since it went into administration last November. ,The northern Cyprus records Ã½are believed to be the key to Polly Peck's operations and its jexact financial position. .. Access to them has been blocked by a series of court .jriunctions in northern Cyprus Mnce November last year. Mr Mentes Aziz, a lawyer Vand businessman close to Mr I4ksil Nadir, Polly Peck chair- man, said yesterday he had ,sought a partial lifting on Tuesday of three injunctions Jaken out in Cyprus courts in rJanuary preventing the access to Sunzest Trading, Polly Peck's citrus exporter, and Uni- dpac, the Famagusta packaging business. Mr Mentes's move follows a .visit to Turkey on Tuesday by Mr Richard Stone of Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, one of the Jhree UK court-appointed administrators. Mr MenteÂ§ said yesterday that, under the terms of the lifting order, the administra- tors must retain all the Cypriot directors of the subsidiaries in place for as long as Polly Peck's administration order remains in force. The injunctions followed the administrators' decision to remove Mr Mentes and Mr Fahri Tunalier, another direc- tor, from the board of Voyager UK, a trust on the Isle of Man through which Polly Peck owns its Cyprus operations. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, two companies linked to Mr Stanley Ho, the Macau casino tycoon, are today expected to announce they are taking a 32 per cent stake in Sansui Group, Polly Peck's loss-mak- ing Tokyo-listed electronics subsidiary, in return for inject- ing fresh loans. If the deal is approved by the Japanese, Mr Ho's Grande Holdings, which has stakes in a number of small manufactur- ing companies, will form a joint venture with Semi Tech, owner of the Singer sewing machine brand name, to take the Sansui stake. The joint venture company has options to increase its stake at a later stage. The stake fits well with both companies' business and allows them into the Japanese market. It also gives them access to Sanuii's research capability for its medium- to high-range audio products. Grande Holdings was formed last year following its takeover of a loss-making computer company. Since then the com- pany has grown quickly, tak- ing control of a Hong Kong- listed consumer electronics company and making a num- ber of other investments, including a 13.6 per cent stake in Betacom of the UK. In the six months to end- June, Grande recorded net profits of HK$52.5m (Â£3.9m), an increase of 82 per cent, from turnover of HK$343.6m. In a separate development, Albert Fisher Holdings, the German subsidiary of Albert Fisher Group, the international fruit trader, is to purchase Fruco, Polly Peck's fresh fruit import, packaging and distri- bution operation, from Willy Bruns, the company's original owner. The 1989 sale of Fruco to Polly Peck has been rescinded. The deal is believed to be worth about DM36m (Â£12.3m). Mr Nadir is due to appear at Bow Street magistrates' court again today on 18 charges of theft and false accounting.",

Where once there was only one supplier of dealing systems, there now seem to be many - all offering apparently perfect solutions to the problems of dealing room cost and space saving.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Franklin IN A half-year which continued to reflect difficult conditions in the housing and commercial property markets, Dencora, the East Anglian- based property group, reported a further sharp fall in profits. Mr John Bushell, chairman, said that although rental income in-the six months to June 30 rose to Â£4.05m against Â£3.27m, the benefit had been more than eliminated by a reduction of trading income from Â£14.2m to Â£5.94m. There were no sales of com- mercial property in the period, reflecting the decision not to sell at depressed prices. Conditions remained diffi- cult for the housebuilding sub- sidiaries, and house prices continued to weaken as the Gulf war and rising unemploy- ment added to the lack of con- fidence caused by high interest rates, Mr Bushell said. At the operating level prof- its fell by Â£1.2m to Â£2.87m. Net interest payable increased to Â£2.66m (Â£2.56m) on borrow- ings up from Â£71m to Â£76m.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Rawatorne BODDINGTON GROUP'S unsuccessful Â£127m bid earlier this year for JA Devenish, the west country pub retailer, cost Â£3.27m and contributed to a retained loss of Â£4.35m for the half year to June 29. The takeover battle contrib- uted to a rise in debt from Â£46.5m to Â£76.9m - gearing of 34 per cent - and interest charges almost doubled from Â£1.2m to Â£2.33m. Boddington has since raised its stake in Devenish to 20.4 per cent - \"increasing the options open to us in the future,\" said Mr Hubert Reid, managing director. There had been no contact with Devenish since the failed bid, he added. Apart from the underwriting costs of the bid, the results were also hit by a further extraordinary charge of Â£4.19m against the cost of withdrawal from the London restaurant operations, Bentley's and MacArthurs. The restaurants incurred a trading loss of Â£800,000 as business suffered because of the recession and a decline in tourism. Pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to Â£7.52m (Â£8.57m) though turnover on continuing activi- ties was 22 per cent higher at Â£76.1m (Â£62.2m) and trading profit increased by 6 per cent to Â£10.1m (Â£9.5m). Basic earnings per share fell to 5.5p (6.2p) but the interim dividend is raised to 2.35p (2.15p). Turnover of the group's 490 pubs increased nearly 9 per cent to Â£35.8m (Â£32.9m) and although beer volumes fell by more than 5 per cent, trading profit was 4.5 per cent higher at Â£8.5m (Â£8.1m). Capital spend- ing on the refurbishment of 69 pubs.amounted to Â£12m. Worsening trading condi- tions, particularly in June, reduced the profits of hotels and restaurants outside Lon- don by 25 per cent, from Â£l.2m to Â£900,000. Liquid Assets, the drinks wholesaling division, trebled trading profit to Â£500,000. Fur- ther acquisitions have since raised the division's turnover, on an annualised basis, to more than Â£100m. The health care division showed a marked improve- ment, with turnover 20 per cent higher at Â£4.8m (Â£4m) and profits increasing 71 per cent from Â£600,000 to Â£lm as occu- pancy rates in the group's homes for the elderly rose to about 80 per cent. * COMMENT City opinion is divided about the prospect of Boddington making a second bid for Deoen ish next year, but the cost of this year's *defeat seems to have been a chastening experi- ence. In hindsight, the Â£3.27m that has gone in underwriting costs would have bought a good package of profitable pubs, whereas the group now re-enters the market for pubs with a considerably heavier debt burden. The acquisition of two drinks wholesalers since the summer has raised current debt levels to about Â£88m. That expansion should begin to pay off in the second half, and with the pub retailing and health care operations apparently standing up reasonably well in poor trading conditions, ana- lysts are forecasting full year pre-tax profits.of Â£18.1m to Â£19.5m against last year's Â£20.1m.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd GEEST, the fresh produce and prepared foods group, reported a 7 per cent increase in taxable profits for the six months to June 29 on the back of improved efficiency in its fresh produce business. Pre-tax profits at the Spald- ing-based group rose from Â£14.1m to Â£15.1m. Turnover increased to Â£324.1m (Â£303.7m). The shares rose by 15p to close at 353p. Trading profit from the key fresh produce business - Geest imports about 60 per cent of the bananas sold in the UK - rose to Â£11.3m (Â£10.9m). As banana production in the Windward Islands was cur- tailed by unusually dry and windy weather, the group said it had made good progress in establishing a Central Ameri- can operation based in Miami and Costa Rica to provide secure sources of the region's relatively cheap bananas. The total cost will be about $42m (Â£24.7m). The group has net cash of Â£20m. Trading profit from the food prepaiation business increased from Â£2.24m to Â£3.23m. Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said: \"We have now returned to sensible margins of around 5 per cent. In July the joint venture company, established last year with Pomona, completed the purchase of the controlling interest in Bargosa in Spain. The group is building a rpen- ing centre in Barcelona, which Mr Sugden said would give the Spanish consumer their \"first ever decent banana\". The interim dividend is increased to 3.6p (S35p). Earn- ings per share Improved from 13.7p to 15.1p. * COMMNT Geest has impressed the mar- ket by seeking to address possi- ble fundamental changes in the structure of the European banana market in the run-up to 1992. By seeking sources of chea fruit and expanding its distribution networt the group is in a good position to con- tinue its impressive profit increase in fresh produce. Con- centration on margins in the food preparation division, which has already started to pay off with margins of about 5 per cent, should continue to produce better results. The net cash position is expected to be reduced over the next few years, but not sufficiently for the group to feel compelled to tap shareholders for funds. With expected full year taxable profits of about Â£27m the shares are trading on a pro- spective multiple of 13.3.",

Turnover came to Â£13.3m (Â£11.5m). Pre-tax profit was Â£1.6m (Â£1.4m), after taking account of Â£122,000 costs of setting up the joint venture company Axis Lighting and reduced invest- ment income of Â£218,000 (Â£255,000). Earnings per share were 8.2p (7.3p). The final dividend is 1.45p for a total of 2.15p (1.87p). 44% decline at Dagenham Motors After reporting \"remarkably resilient\" interim results for the last two years, Dagenham Motors Group saw pre-tax profit fall by 44 per cent for the opening half of 1991. From turnover of Â£61.2m (Â£63.8m) profit worked through at Â£1.0lm (Â£1.8m). Earnings per share were down to 4p (7.3p) basic and to 3.9p (6.7p) diluted, but the interim dividend is again 1.75p. Lower dairy volumes hit Clifford Foods Clifford Foods, the dairy prod- ucts, fruit juices and chilled foods group, yesterday reported a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. It blamed the fall, from Â£2.7m to Â£2.5m, on lower dairy product volumes and poor per- formances by Roy's Quality Foods and Morton Foods. Turnover fell from Â£72.6m to Â£70.3m, partly because of lower juice and dairy products sales and partly from the group's decision to sell milk to the franchisee rather than direct to the consumer. The interim dividend is increased to 4.4p (4p), payable from earnings down to 10.23p (10.51p) per share. SR Gent tumbles by Â£4m to Â£1.lm SR Gent, the clothing manufac- turer, had warned in August of the likelihood of a sharp drop in annual profits and yesterday it reported a near-Â£4m fall to Â£1.08m before tax. The company, which is a large supplier to Marks and Spencer, blamed difficult trad- ing conditions at home and abroad. Sales in the year to June 30 rose from Â£120.1m to Â£124.6m, but costs and overheads took Â£120.1m (Â£112.8m) and operat- ing profit fell to Â£4.44m (Â£7.31m). A reduced final dividend of 0.75p is proposed, making a total of 2p (3p) for the year, on earnings per share of 1.3p (8.3p). Oceonics falls back from halfway result The benefits of cost cutting measures and the elimination of losses from discontinued businesses helped Oceonics Group, the offshore services and communications technol- ogy company, to raise operat- ing profits from Â£1.49m to Â£1.8m in the year to end-March. However, after exceptional items of Â£319,000 and interest payable of Â£544,000 taxable profits came out at Â£938,000, a turnround from previous losses of Â£1.89m but less than the tax- able figure of Â£1.15m at the half-way stage. Turnover amounted to Â£20.5m (Â£30.7m). Earnings per share of 0.4p (losses of 2.7p). Cambridge Isotope shows recovery Taxable profits at Cambridge Isotope Laboratories recovered in the six months to May 31 from $220,000 to $344,000 (Â£204,000). Turnover of $3.86m ($3.53m) included the first sales of Car- bon-13 from its new separation plant. Earnings per share came out higher at 1.6 cents (0.85 cents). Alliance Resources loss cut to $219,000 Alliance Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, reported pre-tax losses for the year to end-April down from $413,000 to $219,000 (Â£130,000) after an exceptional charge of $322,000 relating to officers' and directors' compen- sation. Higher production resulted in turnover rising from $1.15m to $1.71m and proved reserves increasing fivefold to 3.8m bar- rels of oil equivalent. Losses per share were 1 cent (4 cents). Interim dividend cut at Jove Inv Trust Jove Investment Trust, a split capital trust which invests pri- marily in smaller UK compa- nies, is cutting its interim divi- dend. The move reflects the impact of the recession on smaller companies, many of which have reduced or passed divi- dend payments, and an unprec- edented number of receiver- ships. The dividend cut - from 3.45p to 2.7p - was accompan- ied by a forecast that total divi- dends for the current year would not be less that 5.4p. The trust paids total of 7.65p in the previous year. Net asset value at August 31 amounted to 51.31p, against 51.91p, per income share and 26.62p, compared with 57.75p, per capital share. Earnings per income share for the six months to the end of August emerged at 3.05p (3.33p). Approach to Harvey & Thompson Harvey & Thompson, the pawnbroker, has received an approach from Cash American Investment, the largest pawn- broker in the US, for its 27 shops. A short statement yesterday said that the two companies have agreed to exchange infor- mation. Shareholders will be informed as soon as a formal agreement is reached. Baillie Gifford Japan net assets rise At August 31 net asset value of The Baillie Gifford Japan Trust stood at 596.2p per share, a 4.2 per cent increase on 572.1p a year earlier. Net profit for the year to end-August was Â£53,964 (Â£29,788 loss) and earnings per share came out at 0.49p (0.28p losses). There is no dividend. Fired Earth Tiles tumbles by 70% The first half of 1991 saw pre- tax profits at Fired Earth Tiles crash by 70 per cent, from Â£454,000 to Â£136,000. However, that represented a measure of recovery as the group was in loss for the open- ing quarter. Earnings per share came to only 1.79p (5.11p), but the cash position had improved and directors decided to maintain the interim dividend at 1.625p. uÂ·r Â·urrÂ·ruÂ· ~Â·lurrÂ·u ur rÂ·vcu~."

The Birmingham-based group with interests in auto- motive components, car retail- ing, nursery furniture and air- craft lavatory compartments, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Â£6.51m for the six months to endJune, compared with Â£8.01m in the same period of 1990. Mr Astley Whittall, chair- man, warned shareholders that \"there is no change in the markets which we serve and it is therefore likely to be 1992 before we see an improvement in the business climate.\" Cutbacks in Australian car manufacture and reduced demand in the US for mirrors produced at its Adelaide plant held down the performance of the automotive component division. But UK mirror and car lighting profits were higher, as exports compen- sated for falling sales on the domestic market. The group's Ford dealership in Birmingham has scaled down its operations, refusing to make fleet sales accompan- ied by buy-back guarantees. Three quarters of BSG's 400 redundancies, costing Â£700,000, came from staff cuts in the Birmingham car operations. Car sales, which in the days of fleet sales ran at 15,000 a year, were only 1.500, down from 4,000 last time. Overall turnover declined from Â£342.1m to Â£297.4m, but the consumer and special prod- ucts division provided a bright spot with a rise from Â£55.1m to Â£63.8m reflecting higher efficiency in the Australian and UK car safety seats and nursery furniture operations and sharply increased sales of aircraft lavatory compart- ments to Boeing, the US air- craft maker.

The warning came as the international steam specialist announced a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Â£10.2m (Â£12m) for the six months to June 30. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.7p and Mr Chris Tappin, chairman and chief executive, indicated that the final pay-out would also be held at the same level as last year, barring any unforeseen events, for a total of 8.7p. Mr Tappin said the group had put in a creditable perfor- mance in the first half, given difficult trading conditions worldwide. Interest charges, adverse currency rates, and a sharply lower contribution from South America were the main factors affecting profits. Net interest charges were Â£1.35m (Â£446,000 gain). Two thirds of this was due to sinan- cing three acquisitions. Operating income was slightly down at Â£11.5m (Â£11.6m) on turnover ahead 4 per cent to Â£73.5m.

The impact of a strong pound on overseas earnings put heavy pressure on mar- gins. Exchange rate move- ments also sliced Â£600,000 off taxable returns. Although trading conditions around the world had been dif- ficult, Mr Tappin said, the Far East continued to grow strongly. \"We see that as a major area of potential growth,\" said Mr Simon Harris, finance director. The core steam specialty business - representing 85 per V.Ay V UV % % V V AA cent of sales - maintained vol- ume, although gains in Europe during the early part of the year were wiped out as the recession deepened. Brazil experienced severe pressure on margins and contributed no profits in the first half.

Earnings per share fell 17 per cent to 7.9p (9.5p). * COMMENT With other engineering stocks in free-fall recently, Mr Tap- pin's description of a creditable performance cannot be denied. However, analysts were not prepared for a nil contribution from Brazil, nor for the sever- ity of exchange rate factors. Forecasts were shaved from Â£24m to about Â£22m, for a pro- spective p/e of 14.5. Neverthe- less, the increasing use of steam worldwide bodes well for the group, as does its foray into new ranges - the bells and whistles to add to its basic steam trap product. The main- tained dividend will put it on a yield of 4.5 per cent, slightly below the sector average. A reliable, if not exciting stock, and a good one for long-term punters.",

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto THE SHARP deterioration in the housing market depressed Cornwell Parker in the year to July 31. The furniture and fabrics group reported an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Â£8.71m to Â£8.05m. However, the results, which were at the upper end of City forecasts, triggered a 10p rise in the share price to 255p. The continuing appeal of its branded furniture in the reces- sion helped limit the decline. The group said demand for new ranges was particularly buoyant and the contribution to trading profit from the furni- ture business increased to Â£5.65m (Â£4.59m) on turnover up to Â£58.2m (Â£56m). This compared with a sales fall of between 6 and 10 per cent in the furniture industry overall. Mr Martin Jourdan, chief executive, said the group's tar- get audience of those over 45 tended to buy branded prod- ucts as a kind of \"insurance\" against damage. Furthermore, branded products tend to do well in a recession when peo- ple are more conservative in their buying habits. Fabrics, on the other hand, suffered from the mortgage cri- sis. The contribution from this source fell to Â£2.94m (Â£4.85m) on turnover down to Â£34.6m (Â£36.4m). Combined turnover rose moderately to Â£92.8m (Â£92.4m). Earnings per share slipped to 13.2p (15.lp) but the dividend is maintained at 3.9p. An extraordinary cost of Â£2.03m included a trading loss of Â£302,000 from the disposal of County Kitchens, the loss-mak- ing kitchen furniture division that was sold to management earlier this year.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris AIR FRANCE, the French national carrier, yesterday unveiled a complete overhaul of its organisation, just as industry officials said it was on the point of finalising an alli- ance with Sabena, the troubled Belgian carrier. The French and Belgian groups are expected shortly to announce that Air France is to pay BFr4bn ($116m) for a 35 per cent stake in Sabena, with which it will make a commer- cial partnership based on their main hubs at Zaventem and Charles de Gaulle airports. A Belgian financial consortium is expected to provide another BFr2bn. Air France made no official comment, but it is understood the deal will be completed shortly. Only last year, the group took over its two national competitors, Air Inter, the domestic airline and UTA, the long-haul carrier to Africa and the Pacific. Air France is to shed 3,000 jobs - nearly 8 per cent of its workforce - in the next two years and save FFrl.5bn annu- ally, as a result of the reorgani- sation agreed by the board. The changes follow a study by management consultants Andersen Consulting on how Air France could cut its costs and become more competitive. Air France is to merge UTA's routes with its own and will gradually phase out the UTA flag by the end of 1993, but keep the subsidiary's man- agement and remaining staff in place. Air France and UTA had some overlapping routes, but the change will also allow the national carrier to enlarge its network, said an official. It is not known how the job cuts will be shared between UTA and Air France. There was no question of merging with Air Inter's routes because, unlike UTA, they are differen- tiated from Air France, he said. The French national carrier is also selling its central Paris headquarters for FFrl.6bn. It will move to Charles de Gaulle airport, north of the capital, by 1995. This extra cash comes on top of the FFr3bn of fresh capi- tal to come from the French government and from Banque Nationale de Paris.",

   "text_content" : "By NIkki Tait in New York THE US Department of Transportation has given its tentative approval to most ele- ments of the proposed deal between Delta Air Lines and Pan Am, the ailing US carrier which has been operating under bankruptcy court protec- tion since January. However, the DoT reserved any decision over the Detroit- London route authority which Delta wants to buy, as part of a package of assets, from Pan Am. Opposition to this element of the deal has been voiced by Northwest Airlines, which has a hub at Detroit and has been eagerly seeking the London route authority. Assuming the tentative approval is confirmed and the Detroit-London matter sorted out, this effectively clears any regulatory hurdles to the deal. Meanwhile, shares in Pan Am itself have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, and application is being made to delist them. * Mr Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines, said yester- day his carrier was in negotia- tions with Citibank over the possible management of the Trump Shuttle, which flies between Washington, Boston and New York. The Trump Shuttle is one of the businesses managed by Mr Donald Trump, the heavily-in- debted New York property developer and casino owner. Mr Crandall stressed that American was not negotiating to buy the shuttle, but was in talks over a management deal.",

Nikon has fallen victim to a worldwide slowdown in com- puter sales, which has cut demand for semiconductor chips and caused manufactur- ers to postpone investment in capacity for the latest genera- tion of high capacity memory chips, the 4MB D-Ram (4 megabyte dynamic random access memory) chips. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market has already forced many compa- nies to leave the industry, with the last downturn coming about five years ago. Nikon's difficulties also reflect a broad slowdown in the Japanese economy which has cut into capital spending. This has been caused in part by the plunge in the Japanese stock market and high interest rates, which have sharply increased the cost to Japanese companies of raising capital. Hitachi, Japan's leading electrical machinery company, recently said it would cut its own capital budget by 20 per cent in response to the slow- down. Other semiconductor -makers said they were review- ing investment budgets. Nikon, however, has been hit harder because it is more specialised, with 32.4 per cent of sales last year to the semi- conductor industry. Camera equipment was 41.8 per cent of sales. The depth of Nikon's trou- bles is shown even more clearly by a cut in its research and development budget to Y13bn from Y15bn. The cut is proportionately much smaller than the decline in facilities investment, and spending will remain at a similar level to last year. &",

   "text_content" : "Kerin Hope looks at a Greek industry on the move despite recession RIVATE banks are springing up in Athens like mushrooms after an autumn shower. No fewer than four new Greek banks have opened for business in the past nine months, while two more are expected to start taking depos- its before the end of the year. Several more applications for banking licences are awaiting approval from the Bank of Greece, despite the fact that the capital requirement for Greek banks was raised recently from Dr2bn ($10.5m) to Dr4bn. The rush into banking comes as Greece endures a recession that has deterred all but the most determined businessmen from investing. Interest rates have hovered around 30 per cent for the past two years. More than Dr600bn - about 5 per cent of total deposits - has been withdrawn from the banking system since January, when the government intro- ced a 10 per cent tax on interest earnings. However, cautious but steady deregulation since 1987 has radically changed the structure of Greek banking. Controls on interest rates have been abolished, compulsory reserve requirements reduced and curbs on capital movement lifted. Bank profits rose to record levels last year, led by the two existing Greek private banks which both increased their earnings by over 60 per cent. \"Banks have been making high profits because commis- sions are still large and the spreads are so big - 3 or 4 per cent at least,\" says Mr David Watson of Xiosbank. \"Greek entrepreneurs see a chance of making good money in bank- ing.\" Behind the new banks are some prominent names in Greek shipping and industry. Xiosbank is controlled by the Vardinoyannis group, with interests ranging from ship- ping and oil refining to soccer clubs, a newspaper and a pri- vate television station. Xiosbank wants to become Greece's leading consumer bank. It is launching products designed to draw customers away from the state-owned banks, which still control about 80 per cent of the market despite a reputation for slow, bureaucratic service. Personal loans, interest-bearing check- ing accounts and speedily-ar- ranged housing mortgage loans are all available. \"Capital and money markets here are not very deep or mature as yet, so deposits are king. To run a successful bank you must have a good deposit base,\" says Mr Watson. Since opening in March, Xiosbank has attracted Drl2bn in depos- its, while loans total Dr4bn. Like other new banks, Xius- bank must seek an Athens Stock Exchange listing within three years, and had to make at least 20 per cent of its equity available to a Greek or foreign investor. The minority stake was acquired by Luxembourg ased companies controlled by two other leading Greek ship- ping families, Livanos and Goulandris. Foreign banks have bought stakes in two other newly-es- tablished private banks. Bank Worms of France owns a con- trolling interest in Interbank, set up by Mr Dimitris Kontomi- nas, chairman of one of Greece's biggest insurance companies. Bank of Scotland acquired 30 per cent of Dorian Bank, which belongs to Mr John Mavrakakis, another shipping magnate. he Greek tycoons' new- found enthusiasm for banking reflects both increasing interest in diversify- ing and a renewed willingness to invest at home, where the talents of Greek financial man- agers trained by the numerous foreign banks operating in Athens can be drawn on. Under central bank rules, however, the new private banks can finance only a rela tively small part of their own ers' activities: loans to such companies cannot total more than 30 per cent of the capital. The most ambitious of the new banks is Euromerchant, the Athens arm of the banking empire controlled by Mr John Latsis, with banks in Geneva, Luxembourg, Monaco and Lon- don. The group's total equity amounts to about $500m, of which some $170m is accounted for by Private Bank in London, belonging to the same holding group as Eurom- erchant. Euromerchant has already embarked on a joint venture with Alico, the Greek subsid- iary of American International Group, a leading US insurer. The venture involves creating a management company to set up mutual funds on an interna- tional basis. The bank is also co-managing a venture capital fund in co-operation with Bar- ing Venture Partners and a leading Greek businessman. \"The other banks in our group specialise in private banking, but we're in a differ- ent environment, so we're developing other activities as well - corporate banking for selected clients, investment banking and project financ- ing,\" says Mr George Gonticas of Euromerchant. A veteran Greek banker, Mr Gonticas headed a successful state-owned Greek investment bank and went on to help establish Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), now Portu- gal's leading private bank.",

For the six months to June, attributable net profits rose to FFr697m (122.7m) against FFr567m for the comparable period a year earlier. The company stressed that for the full year profits would not match the interim increase because the group concen- trated asset sales, with associated capital gains, in the first half of the year. For the whole of 1990, Lyon- naise des Eaux-Dumez earned attributable net profits of FFrl.42bn. The company said that, with economic conditions now more difficult, it was con- tinuing its efforts to streamline the company by refocusing on environmental services. Turnover for the six months was FFr39.2bn, against FFr34.6bn a year earlier. The company was formed last year through merger of diversified water utility Lyonnaise des Eaux and construction group Dumez.

Club Med, which entertains about 2m people a year in 237 holiday resorts across more than 30 countries, will build and manage the clubs, and LTU will handle the marketing and transport. The French group set up a German branch of Club Med in 1978, but has managed to attract only about 80,000 cus- tomers a year from an esti- mated potential market of 3.6m.

   "text_content" : "By John Burton in Stockholm NORDBANKEN, the SwedisiV state-controlled bank, yester-. day reported an unexpectedlyk large loss of SKr4.6bn ($755.3m) for the first eight months of; 1991 as credit losses and provi, sions reached almostSKr8bn. , Nordbanken is the first bie Swedish bank to fall into the red following a year-long crisis, in the country's finance and; property sectors which haI saddled the banking industrÃ½y: with a growing amount of bad. loans. Similar credit losses, the, result of financial deregulationq and a borrowing boom in the, 1980s, have affected other. banks in the Nordic region. Nordbanken predicted totals credit losses for the year would, amount to SKr9.5bn, the larg- est in the country's banking, history and far above the fore- cast of SKr3.5bn it gave four months ago. Nordbanken had credit losses of SKr5bn last year. The projected losses for 1991, which consist of about 20 large loans, amount to 3.5 per cent of total lending volume and cover about two-thirds of the non- performing loans on the bank's. books. The sharp increase in losses stems partly from the collapse last month of the cor-- porate empire controlled by Mr, Erik Penser, the Swedish sinan- cier, who had a 13.5 per cent stake in Nordbanken. Nordban- ken, his biggest creditor, took. control of Nobel Industries, the chemicals and defence group created by Mr Penser, after he defaulted on loans. The bank warned expected, credit losses could rise further if the property market wors- ens. Nordbanken is heavily, involved in property lending. Yesterday's result poses a potential political problem for Sweden's new non-socialist government. It wants to privat- ise Nordbanken, but that seems unlikely for the moment with the bank reporting losses. The non-socialists also critic- ised a proposal last month that the Swedish state subscribe to. a SKr5bn new share issue by Nordbanken. This would allow the bank to reach a capital ade-- quacy ratio of 8.3 per cent by the end of 1992, while increas- ing its capital base to SKr22bn,",

However, since Asahi's success in 1987, the growth rate has surged to 6.5 per cent. Last year, shipments by the four companies were estimated at 6.5m kilolitres. With dry beer, Asahi turned itself around from a company with dwindling market share. Dry beer sales surged from 18.5m cases in 1987 to 75m cases in 1988. Sales topped 100m in 1989, pushing Asahi's market share to about 25 per cent, surpassing Sapporo. However, Asahi's problems started last year when Kirin Beer, the market leader, launched a premium-priced luxury beer called Ichibanshi- bori. In March, Asahi tried to compensate for the slowing growth in sales of its dry beer by releasing its highly-publi- cised \"Z\" brand, but the new product failed to replicate the success of dry beer. New beer by Sapporo and Suntory have also eroded sales of Asahl's products. Asahi said that the earlier sales projec- tions of an annual 30m cases of \"Z\" would be hard to achieve. As the beer companies are now garing up for autumn campaigns, Asahi hopes to strike back with yet another new beer. The autumn cam- paigns will be the first launched by the Japanese beer industry, as beer sales, which have tended to flatten out in the cooler weather, have been growing steadily. Slaunched its new pre- mium beer last week, while Kirin has started selling an \"autumn beer\" earlier this month to be marketed until November. Suntory also released its Beer Nouveau - a limited edition product made from barley and hop harvested in the same year as the beer is brewed.",

The announcement formally ends the battle for ACM, although the bidders claimed victory last week after ASP Group, the company's largest shareholder, accepted the A$1.11-a-share offer for its 30 per cent stake. Acceptances from small shareholders have since given the bidders a majority share- holding. Resplendid, the jointly owned bid vehicle, yesterday said it owned 66.83 per cent of ACM. ACM shareholders had ear- lier rejected a key plank in the board's defences against the takeover bid - a plan to sell a 50 per cent stake in its Mount Keith nickel deposit in West- ern Australia to Outokumpu Metals and Resources of Finland. Western Mining last week reached agreement to develop the Mount Keith deposit jointly with Outokumpu if the bid suc- ceeded. Mount Keith, with ore reserves of 270m tonnes, is a potentially important source of low-grade ore supplies for Western Mining's nearby Kambalda nickel refinery. Under an agreement between the bidders, Mr Robert Cham- pion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group will acquire control of ACMs gold mines and some other assets.

Mr Bill Hamel, managing direct9r, said sales had fallen A$400m to A$2bn, despite the company's success in main- taining the Commodore as Australia's most popular car. \"To have the number one selling car and see a profit drop of this scale is as good an indicator as you can get of the difficult economic circum- stances under which the indus- try has been operating,\" he said. Mr Hamel said he was opti- mistic that car sales would grow as the economy begins to recover towards the end of the year. \"Business fleets in partic- ular should begin to move in coming months as the cost of maintaining increasingly age- ing car fleets begins to bite.\" Holden operated close to its full capacity in 1980-90, when demand was strong and sales of the Commodore surpassed initial estimates. \"Unfortunately, this past financial year has witnessed a reversal in all three of these conditions,\" Mr Hamel said. He said Holden's ability to turn a profit in the depressed market proved that the company's structure had positioned it to weather \"even a severe eco- nomic environment\". Holden's result is in line with those announced by three of the other four Australian car manufacturers, all of them subsidiaries of US or Japanese groups."

The move Is part of a cost- cutting programme that aims to reduce annual expenses by $250m by 1994. The fourth- quarter charge will cover sev- erance payments and other provision and reserves includ- ing write-offs of impaired assets. Mr Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide chairman, said the aim was to improve the com- pany's profitability by reduc- ing fixed costs at plants, cut- ting administrative and sales expenses and divesting several small non-strategic businesses. The company's first-quarter earnings were lowered to $838m from $94m - both first and second-quarter income sus- fered from the serious disrup- tion caused by an explosion that killed several workers last March at a chemicals plant in Seadrift, Texas. Mr Kennedy said in a letter to employees yesterday that Union Carbide was dedicated to meetings its health, safety and environmental responsi- bilities. On Wall Street, Union Car- bide's share price rose by '/ to $22% yesterday. * CHEVRON, the fourth big- gest US oil and gas groups, said yesterday it would split it US operations into two sepa- rate companies - one cover- ing exploration and produc- tion activities and the other refining and marketing. The split will coincide with the retirement early next year of Mr Will Price, president of Chevron USA.",

   "text_content" : "By Martn Dikduon in New York THERE was an Englishman, a German and a Japanese, and they all wanted to start up businesses in the US. The Englishman launched a noisy takeover bid for a US rival; the German quietly set up his own green field operation; and the Japanese did roughly the same as the German, with a little more emphasis on joint ven- tures with local partners. Those, at least, are the national stereotypes which emerge from a study of Euro- pean direct investment pat- terns in the US which provides tentative answers to how and where foreign companies spend their money in the US, and what issues cause their manag- ers to lose the most sleep. The study was carried out by KPMG Peat Marwick, the con- sulting firm, for the European Institute, a non-profit organisa- tion concerned with Euro- American relations. It was based on interviews with more than 1,600 European investors in 13 US states. A further 800 foreign investors were inter- viewed. The survey is not exhaustive - for example, the states cov- ered do not include California and New York - but it does throw significant fresh light on corporate decision-making. European direct investment in the US soared from $54.5bn in 1980 to $426.5bn at the end of 1990, and while it is still grow- ing, the pace has slowed sharply from the heady days of the mid-1980s. The survey shows that the rate of growth of new Euro- pean investment in the 13 states decreased by 16 per cent in 1988, compared with the pre- vious year, and by a further 35 per cent in 1989. This is pre- sumably due both to the US recession and the new opportu- nities created by the European Community's single market initiative and the opening up of eastern Europe. CROSS-BORDER acquisitions by UK companies continued to decline in the second quarter of the year, according to figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, writes Simon London. UK companies made 74 acquisitions of overseas companies in the three months to the end of June, with a total value of Â£500m (I866.5m). This brings the total number of acquisitions for the first half of 1991 to 188, totalling Â£1.8bn, significantly less than the 258 deals worth Â£5.3bn In the first six months of 1990 and 528 deals worth Â£11.7bn In the first six months of 1989. The CSO noted that the cost of borrowing may still remain too high, given the expected earnings from an acquisition. Acquisitions of UK companies by overseas corporations totalled 25 in the second quarter, totalling Â£1.6bn, well down on the levels of 1989 and 1990. Most European-owned com- panies in the US are small, with 69 per cent of those sur- veyed having sales of $24m or less and only 10 per cent hav- ing sales of over $100m. The larger companies are predomi- nantly British. The method of establishing US operations also varies sig- nificantly from country to country. Despite the publicity given to takeover bids, nearly three-quarters of the compa- nies in the study were estab- lished as start-ups, compared with 25 per cent through acqui- sitions and 4 per cent through joint ventures. But 40 per cent of the UK subsidiaries were established by takeovers, com- pared with 22 per cent for France, 15 per cent for Japan and 13 per cent for Germany. However, once established, a significant number of Euro- pean companies - 32 per cent said they were now consid- ering expanding through acqui- sitions. British companies were again most interested, with 43 per cent seeking new take- overs, followed by 38 per cent of French companies and 35 per cent of Dutch ones. Only 19.5 per cent of German companies were actively inter- ested in buying a US concern. Ms Francine Lamoriello, the author of the report, says this perhaps confirms that German investors increasingly intend to devote their resources to eastern Germany and other parts of Europe. Her research conflicts with conventional wisdom that tax and other investment conces- sions by US states are impor- tant factors in a company's decision where to locate in America. Being close to key industries and markets tends to be the most important sac- tor, together with convenient air transport. For example, south-eastern states such as Georgia and the Carolinas attract forest industry invest- ment from Scandinavia, and textile investment from Ger- many and Switzerland. Japanese investors are much more likely than European to consider the quality and cost of labour and particular distribu- tional advantages of an area. Says Ms Lamoriello: \"These results perhaps indicate that states and local policies which capitalise on the strength of indigenous industries may be more successful in attracting foreign direct investment than general promotional pro- grammes which provide tax and other financial incentives to all investors.\" 0 European Investment in the United States.

No. 01/00429/06) Extracts from Chairman Patrick Retief's Review Results The financial year was characterised by international and local developments that resulted in unfavourable trading conditions for Johnnies. Against this background, the results are satisfactory. Earnings attributable to shareholders declined from R430 million to R418 million. Equity-accounted earnings declined by 6.1% to R565 million and the total dividends for the year were maintained. The nature and spread of Johnnies major strategic investments insulated the Group from the worst effects of the unfavourable trading conditions. Platinum Earnings from Rustenburg Platinum Holdings grew by 9.6% although the platinum price suffered a net decline over the year Potgietersrust Platinums is to develop a new mine on the Platreef, the working costs of which will be among the lowest in the industry. Gold Income from gold mining investments again declined sharply. Remedial actions taken at Western Areas returned the company to profitability. Diamond The Group's diamond interests continue to account for a substantial portion of its income, although the diamond trade was affected by the general economic slow-down. Ferrochrome The enlarged Consolidated Metallurgical Industries is well placed to take advantage of firmer conditions in the ferrochrome market when these eventuate. Coal The attributable profits of Tavistock rose by 41.7% to R48.9 million and its share of the export market will again improve with the commissioning of the Arthur Taylor Colliery extension. Industrial In a difficult environment the Group's non-managed industrial investments again performed satisfactorily. Outlook The difficult trading conditions experienced by the Group last year will probably persist during the current financial year Although there are indications of a gradual recovery in the World economy this is unlikely to gather sufficient momentum to be of appreciable benefit to our majoi; export-oriented interests. In view of this, it would be imprudent at this early stage to venture a forecast of the Group's earnings for the current financial year The Annual General Meeting will be held in Johannesburg on 24 October 1991.

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron in New York and Sarsa Wbb in London HAVING fluctuated up and down for most of thi day, US bond prices eased late in'the session after market players trimmed their long positions and took profits in the ikie of a moderately successful auc- tion of five-year notes. In late trading, the bench- mark 30ryear Treasury issue was down '/ at 1021, yielding 7.894 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99L, to carry a yield of 6.125 per cent: Early news that durable goods orders in August fell 3.8 per cent led to some sporadic selling - analysts had forecast a larger fall and had also not expected July's initial 11.2 per cent rise in orders to be revised upwards to 11.7 per cent. Prices later rallied as dealers set up positions for the sale of $9.25bn of five-year notes. The auction passed unevent- fully, although there was less customer demand than for GOVERNMENT BONDS Tuesday's two-year notes and bond prices firmed further on news of weakness in the hous- ing market from the National Association of Realtors, which reported that sales of existing single-family homes in the US fell 2.1 per cent in August. Late profit-taking, however, reversed those gains. SIN London, the Liffe gilt future fell from its opening level of 96.09 to close at 96.01, while the benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell to 11411 from 114l. \"The recent rally in gilts seems to have run out of steam\" said one trader, adding that the most recent opinion polls - which put the opposi- tion Labour party ahead of the Conservatives - have unset- tled the market. * THE German government bond market received the sale of DM3.952bn of four-year Trea- sury notes favourably yester- day. Traders reported plenty of shortening trades out of long- dated bunds and switching out of notes of a similar maturity into the new paper. The government accepted bids of 99.55 and above for the four-year Bundesschatzanwei- sungen, which have a 8.75 per cent coupon to yield 8.88 per cent. The Bundesbank kept DM2.044bn for market regula- THEi BANK of England yesterday sold Â£1.5bn of long-dated UK government bonds at auction, but failed to attract the siltk level of interest seen at other gilt auctions this year. The' action of 9'/ per cent Conversion stock due 2004 was versubcrbd only 1.93 times. By comparison, the AprL uloni of n 1Â£.2bn of five-year gilts was oversubscribed 4.5 tujis, with particularly strong demand from foreign buyers. STr4adets said that the bid-to-cover ratio - the degree to hiedh the auction is oversubscribed - on yesterday's auc- tion was disappointing. The Bank said the average accepted price was 99%&, yield- ing 9.54 per cent. The lowest accepted bid was 99&, yielding 9.\", pir cent, while the highest accepted bid was 99M1, yield- ing 9.5 per cent. The Bank said that 46 per cent of the bids were allotted at the lowest price. Following the auction the total size of the 9% per cent gilt due 2004 is Â£3bn. The issue is partly paid, with 35 per cent payable on tender, 35 per cent on October 28 and the balance on November 18. tion. The market had not expected the issue to be partic- ularly well received due to the inconvenient timing of the issue's coupon payments. German government bonds ended the day unchanged as the Liffe bund futures contract opened at 85.31 and traded in a range of 85.29-85.44 before clos- ing at 85.32. News that the cost of living in the state of Hesse climbed 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-September to give a year- on-year 4.6 per cent increase came as a disappointment. Two other west German states reported year-on-year con- sumer price rises of below 4 per cent earlier in the week, raising hopes that inflation was beginning to fall. Elsewhere, traders reported some interest in short-dated Danish government bonds, given that yield spreads over two-year French government paper is around 60 basis points.

   "text_content" : "By Katherine Campbell '; in Frankfurt DEUTSCHE Bank is steppin\"T up its involvement across the'' Elbe with a new venture cap1'- tal company to purchase and restructure former state enter- ' prises. ' East German politiciansr- notably Saxony's premier, MÂ«S Kurt Biedenkopf, have warne4, that the privatisation proO gramme was resulting almost- exclusively in struggling east- ern companies being swat- lowed by large establisheOt\" western names. They point to the dangers dft an economy of subsidiaries which would lack the vigour of a more independent an-\"' varied industrial culture. Germany's largest bank haWr teamed up with industrialist' Mr Peter Jungen, formerly\"' chief executive of Strabag, the big construction company, to run a new venture exploring an alternative approach to resuscitating portions of east German industry. Mr Jungen, who resigned from Strabag in June, had. spent four years attempting tq restore Strabag's fortunes' after large losses incurred by overseas projects, notably in Iraq. Deutsche already owns 92.5' per cent of another venture capital operation, Deutsche\" Beteiligungsgesellschaft- (DBG). In contrast to DBG, which- takes stakes limited to 49 per cent in small and medium-- sized companies, including a' sprinkling in the east, the new business will purchase 100 per cent of larger Treuhand enter- prises, with the aim of restructuring them over a- period of some years. They would be reorganised with a view to a possible stock market listing, a partial man-' agement buyout, or purchase by a foreign company hithert6o daunted by the initial turn around task. Mr Jungen's background is! likely to suggest a focus on the\" construction industry, withl other sectors of interest, including engineering. He will work closely with the DBG. team as well as hiring other industrialists. The venture will initially be capitalised at DM100m. Deut- sche says it plans to attract other institutional investors to enlarge the capital base at a later date.",

A price for the deal was not disclosed. However, Pirelli said Ambroveneto would buy into Caboto via a special rights issue, to be approved before the end of this year. At the same time, Banca Brig! none, the small Turin-based. Italian bank which owns 9.9 per cent of Caboto, would cease to be a shareholder. Ambroveneto and Caboto will set up a joint venture Soc- ieta di Intermediazione Mobil- iare (SIM), Italy's new form of stockbroking and fund man. agement operation. Banca Brignone, in which Pirelli and. Caboto themselves have a com- bined 5.2 per cent holding, will eventually also buy into the SIM.

   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrign THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's debut offering in the international capital markets yesterday was sold o01 within a couple of hours of itslaunch. jWealers said they could have plced their allotments of bonds several times over. INTERNATIONAL BONDS kistribution of the Ecu5OOm deal was also extremely broad, with strong demand from the Fa East and from European r4ail investors, as well as from the large European fund mangers. ian he relatively small size of the deal, compared with other benchmark issues, and the rarity value of the EBRD napne, dealers said the paper could become quite tightly held. The success of the deal, at a time when the Ecu market has been providing a less-than-sparkling performance, was largely attributed to the special interest aroused by the EBRD name. The five-year deal was priced to\" yield 8.92 per cent, which was the same level as Belgium's Ecul.25bn five-year bonds were trading in the secondary market. Spain's Eculbn issue of five-year bonds were trading at a slightly higher yield of 9.02 per cent. Although the EBRD is a stronger credit than both these sovereign borrowers, dealers said the deal was sensibly priced,, given the EBRD's priority of achieving a successful debut issue, combined with attractive financing costs. Coinciding with the EBRD deal, one of its member countries also tapped the bond market yesterday. Hungary, through the conduit of the National Bank of Hungary, launched a DM400m deal, increased from DM250m, via Dresdner Bank. The deal met firm demand from German retail investors, who also bought South Africa's DM400m deal with some enthusiasm. Although Hungary remains encumbered by one of the highest debt burdens in eastern Europe, its economic prospects appear to be improving. The deal was quoted at 98.82 bid, from an issue price of 100'/s, comfortably within 2% point fees. In the dollar sector, Kreditanstalt fifr Wiederaufbau, the German agency, followed up on the success of Belgium's 10-year dollar deal on Tuesday with a further SO50m of 10-year bonds. The KfW deal also met firm demand, as bullish sentiment on dollar bonds persists. In the French domestic market, SNCF, the French national railway, launched a FFr2.8bn domestic bond issue, with a FFrl.bn international tranche. SNCF is one, of a group of French state borrowers trying to promote international trading of its domestic debt. Both the international and domestic portions of the deal were sold out. Elsewhere, the World Bank launched its first deal in the Portuguese market, an Escl5bn five-year \"Caravela\" bond (a foreign bond in the Portuguese domestic market) via Banco Portugues Investimento. It is the 14th such issue in the nascent Portuguese market for foreign borrowers. The coupon level of 12 per cent is the lowest to date, reflecting dropping interest rates in Portugal, as inflation in that country falls and European economies start to converge. The issue was quoted at less 1 bid, well within 1% point fees, with distribution concentrated in Switzerland, Germany and Italy. The deal was swapped into floating rate D-marks.",

   "text_content" : "William Dawkins on plans which should help Paris recover business lost to London N O sooner has the Paris equity market digested its own version of the Big Bang than a fresh round of reforms is getting under way. Over the past three years, the government and the bourse authorities have broken up the old cartels, modernised the market's settlement and trad- ing services, and overhauled its rule book. The first steps to liberalisa- tion began a decade ago, the trend accelerated under the former Gaullist government, and is now being carried on determinedly by Mr Pierre Bdr- egovoy, the socialist finance minister. Ironically, one side-effect of all this has been a flow of busi- ness to London's less-regulated Seaq International, where about 30 per cent of Paris's main stocks are now traded, to the anxiety of local brokers. Stock market professionals are putting pressure on the government, in a report pub- lished in July, to reduce restrictions on the block mar- ket for big investors and to reduce taxes and improve incentives for private investors in order to make Paris more competitive. Local stockbroking firms were losing business to Seaq International even before the 1987 crash, say officials. Many of them have also had their profits painfully squeezed by a fall in commission rates, now at an average of 0.65 per cent, say bourse officials. Several operators have been forced to trim their operations, so that the number employed by Paris stockbrokers fell to 5,000 from 6,500 in 1990 alone, according to a study by Price Waterhouse. There have been inevitable failures, the climax of which was last year's spec- tacular collapse of Tuffler et Associds. The first step in the moderni- sation of the bourse began with the introduction of paper- less ordering in 1984, followed two years later with continu- ous centralised trading on the so-called CAC system (Cotation Assistde en Continu), and the opening of the Matif futures and Monep options markets in 1987. Stockbrokers' traditional monopoly began to crack in 1988, when for the first time banks were allowed to buy broking firms. Since then, all but four of the 58 member- nrms have linked with an out- side partner, and 13 are now majority foreign owned, say bourse authorities. Within the overall total, 12 are inactive and currently the subject of bids from foreign frms seeking an opportunity for cheap way to get a stock exchange seat. The same year also saw the establishment of the two oper- ating bodies, the Socidt des Bourse Francaises (SBF) as market executive and the Con- seil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) as regulator. The CBV works alongside the Commis- sion des Operations de Bourse, which since 1967 has been the market watchdog, and was given independence and more power to impose sanctions in 1989. Brokers were given the free- dom to become market makers and trade on their own account for the first time in 1989, a badly needed new source of profit in view of the disappear- ance of fixed commissions in July that year.

Source: SooldM d BourM FranUaleSF accompanied by the introduc- tion in October of a limited block trading system to allow professional investors to trade large blocks of shares off-mar- ket. A year later, the SBF opened the first stage of a FFr600m ($105m) electronic clearance and settlement system. Relit, for a small number of stocks on the over-the-counter mar- ket. Since then, Relit - said to be the envy of many foreign markets - has expanded and will cover the most actively traded shares from next month. The final step in this first round of reforms comes next January when the stockbro- kers' closed shop, founded by Napoleon, will finally end, leaving any institution free to apply for a stock exchange seat. S o what have these changes achieved? Relit has made settlements fas- ter, reducing the average time to complete a settlement from 13 days before the system was set up to five. It is aiming for three, say CBV officials. In 1988, FWfl5bn worth of deals took more than three months to settle, but no trades were that late last year, says the 3BV. At the same time, the lion's share of business has become increasingly concentrated on *rokers lucky enough to have attracted a parent able to pro- vide capital and back office support, or a big bank share- holder with a wide retail net- work. Around half of market turn- over now goes through the top five brokers, such as market leader Cholet Dupont, or Bacot Allain, owned by BNP and Warburg respectively, while foreign owned brokers proba- bly account for 30 per cent of trading, estimate bourse offi- cials. This leaves thin pickings for the rest, left to find a living as portfolio managers or spe- - cialists in a limited number of broking functions. Specialisation will become easier from next January, when the CBV will start issu- ing separate licences for differ- ent stockbroking activities for the first time. This means, for example, that a small firm could obtain a licence as a pure trader and sub-contract its clearing activi- ties - the most capital inten- sive part of the business - to another broker, rather than having to do it in-house. Segmentation is also being seen as a way of stopping a disaster in one part of the busi- ness from damaging clients' accounts, an important mar- keting advantage. Already, several leading bro- kers have started to put differ- ent functions into financially watertight subsidiaries, to reassure customers following the collapse of 'TIuffier, under investigation for allegedly using clients' money to cover trading losses. In encouraging segmenta- ion, the CBV is acting on one of the main proposals in the professionals' report, prepared by a working party headed by Mr Rend de la Serre, managing director of Credit Commercial de France, the privatised bank. The report also calls for the abolition of turnover tax, between 0.15 per cent and 0.: per cent depending on the size of the deal. This is seen as . disadvantage against London where turnover tax will be abolished when Taurus, the paperless trading system, is ntroduced, and Frankfurt, which abolished the tax in Jan. uary. This is a long-standing demand from French brokers and has so far evoked little enthusiasm from the sinan- cially hard-stretched finance ministry, which would lose around FFr2bn a year if it scrapped turnover tax. However, Mr Bdrdgovoy's advisers are slightly more sym pathetic to the other main iemand in the de la Serre report - for a relaxation in restrictions on block trading between institutional inves ors. Currently, this is only iallowed on a matched bargain basis, in contrast to London's price driven system. Finance ministry officials sav they share the desire of brokers to attract more big nvestors. But before taking iction, they are awaiting the results of a more detailed study on block trading, due to be delivered by a CBV working group in mid-November.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters THE Bank of France yesterday followed the Bank of England in proposing an improved mechanism for clearing pay. ments in Ecus. Both central banks said they were acting to encourage the development of private Ecu markets in their respective financial centres. The Bank of France said any commercial bank which main- tained an Ecu account with it could earmark some of the bal- ance to guarantee loans between it and another bank. Seven of the 45 Ecu clearing banks are based in Paris. The Bank of England this week proposed a similar arrangement for the 11 Ecu clearing banks in London. It added a further refine- ment, allowing banks which need funds to settle their posi- tions by borrowing overnight from the Bank. The borrowing can be secured against the UK govern- ment's Ecu bills or against var- ious forms of sterling public sector debt. The Ecu clearing arrange- ments are operated by the Ecu Banking Association and the Bank for International Settle- ments. The association is now looking at further ways to improve the Ecu clearing sys- tem, which handles around Ecu30Obn a day.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington SECURITIES market regul- ators from the US and the UK yesterday signed a new agree- ment to expand their co-opera- tion in the fight against inter- national securities fraud. The pact enlarges on a 1986 agreement, by expanding the field of possible offences on which the Department of Trade and Industry and the Securi- ties and Investments Board in the UK can co-operate with their counterparts at the US Securities and Exchange Com- mission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The US and UK regulators already exchange information on illegal market practices. The new agreement will also cover the disclosure of share- holdings and the conduct of tender offers. Regulators can now also use compulsory powers to demand documents or subpoena wit- nesses on each other's behalf.",

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hargreaves MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night agreed to raise the ceiling on collective output for the fourth quarter to 23.65m barrels of oil a day (b/d) in the hope that prices will head towards $21 a barrel by the end of the year. As no individual production quotas were fixed for each member country, the ceiling is likely to prove purely sym- bolic, however. Opec output is currently running over 1m b/d above the ceiling of 22.3m b/d set in March. Mr Subroto, Opec's Secretary General, said that member states believed oil prices would continue to rise towards the $21 a barrel Opec minimum ref- erence. Asked about the lack of accord on quotas he replied that \"we are not talking about quotas now because we are still in an abnormal situation\". It would only return to nor- mality when Iraq and Kuwaut produced and exported at their levels of July 1990. Mr Subroto said that a spe- cial meeting of the ministerial co-ordinating committee would be convened if oil prices varied greatly from the $21 reference. Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said: \"It may hap- pen that the ceiling will allow members to produce to their maximum levels, but it is not a free-for-all.\" Saudi Arabia is unlikely to trim its production since its forecast of fourth quarter demand is more optimistic than those of other countries. The kingdom had been push- ing to increase overall Opec production to around 24m b/d. Some of the Organisation's smaller producers had been calling on Saudi Arabia to commit itself to cutting back output next year once Iraq and Kuwait return to the market in more volume. The kingdom has been reluc- tant to specify output levels beyond stating that it will be Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer (left) talks to Homoud Al-Rqobah, the Kuwaiti minister, at this week's meeting flexible. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, wants to maintain the kingdom's pro- duction at 8m b/d or more. Kuwait said that it will pro- duce 800,000 to 1m b/d by next July and it would take another year to return to the 1.5m b/d level prior to the Iraqi invasion in August 1980. Iraq says it can export 1m to 1.5m b/d as soon as sanctions are lifted and that it could fill its Opec quota of 3.14m b/d in the second half of next year. Opec abandonned production quotas in August last year after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in order to compensate for the lack of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil in the market. But the Opec reaffirmed its commitment to a production- sharing agreement reached in July last year that could be revived once Iraq and Kuwait return fully to the market. Because this agreement puts the Saudi output share at 5.4m b/d, it is unlikely to be restored in in its old form. If Opec countries are to get a fair return for their oil, we must move back to a quota sys- tem,\" Mr Aminu said. This should take place when Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude begins to -ave a material effect on the market, he said. A production ceiling of 23.65m b/d would help the Organisation finally achieve its reference price of $21-a-barrel by the end of the year since many market analysts believe that demand for Opec oil will be higher than the ceiling. Mr Michael Rothman, senior energy futures analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York said: \"The supply-demand bal- ance looks like becoming increasingly fragile into the winter.\" He said that he would not be surprised to see New Yor:: prices approach $24 a barrel by the year end. This implies a price of $21 a barrel for the Opec basket. The Opec secre- tariat is forecasting demand for Opec oil of 24.42m b/d in the first quarter of next year.",

   "text_content" : "By Canute James in Kingston, Jamaica FOLLOWING THE failure of their cartel, which controlled the world market for five years, the major nutmeg pro- ducers are trying to production control to end a glut and to push up prices. Producers in Indonesia and Grenada have agreed on new production lev- els that will reduce the volume available on the market, and the Grenadians are contemplat- ing destroying some stocks to lift prices further. Indonesia accounts for 75 per cent of the world's nutmeg out- put, with Grenada producing 23 per cent. Their cartel, which set prices and production lev- els, collapsed earlier this year, following Grenadian allega- tions that the Indonesians had been selling below agreed mini- mum prices. They have now agreed to reduce production from about 11,000 tonnes a year to just under 9,000 tonnes, with the aim of tripling prices which fell to about US$2,500 per tonne from an average of $6,500 when the cartel was intact. While waiting for the effects of the limit on production to be reflected in prices, the Grena- dian producers are in a dilemma over what to do with their surplus. Mr Denis Noel, the island's junior agriculture minister, said local producers must find new markets for the spice, or burn excess stocks to ease the glut. \"If we create an artificial shortage, we keep the buyers hungry and therefore the prices will shoot up,\" Mr Noel said. But destroying stocks should be a last resort and be done in collaboration with Indonesia, the minister said. He did not detail the size of the stocks. With the glut on the world market, Grenada's earnings from nutmeg fell from US$5.9m in 1988 to $1.8m last year."

   "text_content" : "CONCERN ABOUT the unrest in Zaire, an important copper supplier, sparked a rally in the London Metal Exchange copper market yesterday. The cash price wiped out Tuesday's Â£25 fall with a Â£26 advance to Â£1,348.50 a tonne at the close, but it remained Â£17 down on the week so far. Dealers said this week's riots in Kinshasa and signs that the violence is spreading to the mining areas of the country have now become more prominent as market factors. Nickel prices were also firm, the cash position at the LME adding $80 to Tuesday's $70 rise to close at $7,585 a tonne.

However, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch said in a review yesterday that prices were expected to remain under pressure, because of the surge in Soviet exports and poor demand. Recent production cuts by Inco and Falconbridge would have little or no impact on the market balance, he predicted. Technically-inspired buying was responsible for a strong rally in cocoa prices, dealers said.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney THE . AUSTRALIAN government said yesterday that it had agreed to US deiiands. for \"voluntary\" restrictions ons on beef exports to avoid the imposition of legally enforceable quotas. Sales to the US would be restricted to'387,020 tonnes this year, compared with 365,000 tonnes last year, it said. Australian farmers had hoped to repeat last year's sales leveL The agreement is a blow to Australia's farming industry, which has already been bat- tered by the collapse of the wool market, competition frbm subsidised US and Euro- pean grain and falling world prices for other commodities. Mr Michael Duffy, the acting trade minister, said Australia had argued that restraints were not necessary, but had been forced to accept that vol- untary restrictions repre- sented the best deal that could be achieved. \"The government faced the choice of negotiating the best possible export level for the Australian beef industry or accepting the imposition of quotas... which would have led to an immediate cessation of exports,\" he explained. Mr Duffy said the restric- tions would cause \"significant short term disruption\" to the beef industry, but added that the revised sales target would still represent the fourth big- gest level of exports to the US since 1980. The US action will fuel anger in Australia over the conflict between US support in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt for liberalisation of agricul- tural trade, and the protection- ist stance of the US Agricul- ture Department. Australia and the US have already clashed several times this year over sales of subsi- dised US grain to countries regarded as traditional mar- kets for Australia's virtually unsubsidised wheat. Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister, has accepted US claims that its stance is intended to increase pressure on the European Community, which is regarded by both the US and Australia as the chief obstacle to trade liberalisa- tion. Mr Hawke said earlier this week, however, that the disruption of farm trade would be at the top of the agenda when President Bush visited Australia later this year. Farmers are expected to demonstrate against US agri- cultural policy during the visit, and the National Farm- ers' Federation and other groups hope to gather millions of signatures for a petition seeking an end to subsidised US exports.",

   "text_content" : "Damian Fraser talks to the president of the state-owned producer U1 CBA, WHICH has more U than a third of the = world's nickel reserves, is likely to produce just 40,00C tonnes of nickel this year, down from 46,000 tonnes in 199%, according to a .senior Cuban government official. In the first7 half of this year Cuba's nickel production reached 18,500 tonnes. Mr Walter Leo, president of the government-run Cuba- nickel, blamed the sharp fall in iroduction on changes in east- ern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which have lead to shortages in Cuba of sul- pnur and petroleum. However, according to Mr Leo, Cuban nickel production will more than double in'the next five years, thanks in 'part to a $1.2bn investment from a western mining company. Cuba, says Mr Leo, also has found a new way of using extractive technology and eauipment to make smelters more efficient. Cuba exports almost all its nickel production. In 1990 some 70 per cent of exports went to the West, and 30 per cent at a preferential (i.e. high) price to the Soviet Union. This was almost an exact reversal of past years when Cuba exported 70 per cent of its nickel to the former Comecom block, and 30 per cent to the West. Eastern European countries (excluding the Soviet UTnior) have already Analysts in London point out that the plant at Punta Gorda has been usin an ammonium carbonate leaching process followed by drying the concentrates and leached sediments. The total process consumes about 15 tonnes of oil for each tonne of nickel produced. Therefore, production of 10,000 tonnes of nickel would require 180,000 tonnes of fuel oil, which on the open market would cost more than $25m. The proposed Las Camariocas plant was expected by western analysts to use the same process. stopped paying Cuba preferen tial prices for its nickel. This year the proportion of exports going to the West is likely to increase, while next year the Soviet Union may start paying international prices for its nickel, further eroding Cuba's hard currency earnings. As Mr Leo said \"the idea is that all exports will [soon] be at international prices\". The Cuban official refused to say with which foreign com- pany the government had signed a $1.2bn contract. How ever it had signed a \"risk\" rather than a \"service\" con tract with Cuba; the payment it receives will depend on how much nickel is produced. The company is helping Cuba to apply new smelter technology that should enable the country to expand produc tion. The technology was developed mainly by Cubans, but was based on US and Cana dian systems. Thanks to the technology, Cuban nickel plants should use energy more efficiently, while the nickel extracted will be of a higher quality. The first beneficiary will be the Punto Gorda smelter, which has been plagued by operational problems in the past decade. The plant was commissioned more than 15 years ago, but is now only producing at only a third of its capacity of 30,000 tonnes a year. Nevertheless, by 1995 the smelter should be producing at full capacity, according to Mr Leo. The quality of the nickel will be much higher than in the past, so that Cuban mate- rial will be suitable for the 40 per cent of world nickel demand that is currently out of its reach. The Camariocas smelter, which originally was meant to be running by 1992, will start producing nickel in 1993. It should reach its capacity of production of 30,000 tonnes by 1996. The two older smelters, at Moa and Nicaro, can produce about 18,500 tonnes of nickel,a year each - although in 1991 there output will be substat- tially less because of shortages of raw materials. By 1993 thliy will together be able to pup- duce 47,000 tonnes of nickl, says Mr Leo. Cuba has long had amblti(s plans to expand nickel produo- tion, but they have founderd thanks to poor Soviet technol. ogy and irregularity of sup- plies. The Soviets and Cubans have in recent years investfd between $lbn and $1.5bn in the upgrading the two old smelters at Moa and Nicaro, and build- ing Punta Gorda and Camari9- cas, but output has never come close to the target of 100,000 tonnes set for 1992. The Cuban government offi- cial claims that old problems have been sorted out. Cuba, he says, has learnt from past nils- takes; the smelters have twe necessary infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and able Cuban technicians, in place; while the new extractive tech- nology is substantially supe- rior to that in the past. Most Cuban nickel, he says, is close to the surface, and thus \"the conditions are very economi- cal\" to exploit the metal. Nevertheless, as this year's fall in output suggests, future Cuban nickel production remains vulnerable to national shortages of petroleum, and other essential supplies.",

   "text_content" : "By Barbara Durr in Chicago THE MARKET'S assumption that the Soviet Union will sell massive amounts of gold to pay for purchases from the West is likely to be reversed in the next few weeks, sending the gold price upward, accord- ing to the World Gold Council. Mr James Hildebrandt, vice president of the council, which represents 74 gold producing companies, made that assess- ment at a conference for institutional investors in Chi- cago. The conference was intended to persuade them of the timeliness of gold invest- ment now. Mr Hildebrandt said that the market had also been over-esti- mating gold production and reserves in the Soviet Union. He put production at 200 tonnes per years and falling and reserves at 1,000 to 1,200 tonnes. Partly bearing out the coun- cil's message, the gold price rose following the statement on Tuesday that Gosbank would not sell any of its 374.5 tonnes of monetary gold reserves. Mr Hildebrandt also pre- dicted a brighter outlook for gold over the next few years as mine production slows signifi- cantly and demand remains strong. Although jewellery demand, which outpaces all other categories, was flat dur- ing the first six months of 1991, he said jewellery demand con- tinued to exceed mine supply. An economic rebound in the US could also help sales. Investment demand has also not been as weak as many have thought, said Mr Hilde- brandt, \"It has just moved east.\"",

Curragh says environmental approvals are being negotiated and project financing com- pleted. The province earlier this week issued a mining permit. The property will produce __ 250,000 tonnes of sinc-lead con- centrates annually for export. About C$57m (Â£29m) has already been spent on develop- ment and bringing the mine into production late in 1993 will cost a further C$177m. Mine life is estimated at a min- imum 20 years. Curragh owns 70 per cent of Stronsay and associated Astu- riana de Zinc of Spain 30 per cent. ADZ already imports Cur- ragh zinc concentrates for smelting. Curragh operates one of the world's biggest zinc/lead mines at Faro, in the North- west Territories, and this week is opening another mine in Watson Lake, also in NWT. * In north-western Quebec, Aur Resources and Louvem Mines have halted shaft sink- ing on the Louvicourt copper- zinc property while feasibility studies and project financing are completed. Developing the mine to production will cost C$300m. The two companies are backed by Teck Corporation and Noranda.",

   "text_content" : "By Barbara Durr THE US Department of Agriculture has made the terms of its credit guarantees for Soviet Union imports of US agricultural commoditiesmdre attractive to commercial banks. The department said that it would increase its guarantee of the principle to 100 per cent from 98 per cent and raise the interest rate cover to the aver- age rate of 52-week Treasury bills, at present more over 5.5 per cent, from the standard cover of 4.5 per cent. Banks have been unwilling to finance the Soviets' credits under the standard USDA terms because of their worries about Soviet credit-worthiness. They had indicated, however, that a liberalisation of the terms could induce them to lend. The department's action only applies to the remaining $199m worth of credits avail- able during this US fiscal year, which ends September 31. A decision on whether to liberal- ise the terms of the guarantees to the Soviets during the 1992 fiscal year has not yet been announced, though steps to expedite the credits are widely anticipated.",

   "text_content" : "Liguria and the city of Genoa have failed to tackle the problems of the past decade which have hit the region's heavy industries. But now they are awakening to the need for change and are pinning much of ,teir hopes on attracting high-tech industries. Dominick Coyle reports Â¶'TIE PORT city of Genoa is not quite Liguria, but it dominates the region. Then again, Liguria is not quite Italy, although the region nestles there in the country's north-west, forming an arc between the French bor- ider and the coast of Tuscany and surrounded by the power- Jul regions of Piedmont, Lom- bardy and Emilia-Romagna. To the south lies the Ligur- ian Sea, and in many ways that is the key to Liguria and to an understanding of its peo- ple. Genoa and the sea have been inseparable for centuries, and the sea has been the source of its great wealth. , Founded by the ancient Lig- urians in the Fifth Century BC, it was the Romans who first saw its potential as a natural tiading port. Genoa has lived pn it ever since, often glorious, always profitable and some- times - and now is one of those occas-nns, - with some dloubts about its future. Its people have traditionally been merchants, not entrepre- qeurs - a distinction which .most foreign businessmen .quickly observe and one which some locals acknowledge, although it is now waning somewhat - and the chal- lenges facing Genoa today call very much for real enterprise. Genoa has for long depended on port-related activities, including heavy industry (notably steel), shipbuilding and port handling facilities, all sectors which are now in diffi- culties. Genoa and Liguria overall must now seek a new way forward, and this the region is doing, albeit slowly and with some uncertainty, but also with some imagina- tion. Liguria, but again very much Genoa in particular, is not without support from its history: an autonomous mili- tary and trading city state early in the Middle Ages, Genoa in the Tenth Century was the dominant naval force in the whole of the Mediterra nean, and in time was to open up new flows of trade between Europe and the East, including the \"silk route\" to China. Its resultant great wealth made the Genoese the first bankers in Europe, enabling its powerful city families to finance the military adven tures of many European sover eigns of the day. In the 16th Century, the astute Genoese financier, Giovanni Spinola, almost single-handedly financed the Spanish emperor in many of his costly wars, using some of his high interest aenoa ana ugunr overan mus now s=K a neW way Torwra, ana MW me reglon Ir aoing, aiDen slowly ana wnm uncerainzy charges to build what is today the imposing palazzo of the Banca d'America e d'Italia on Genoa's historic and architec- turally impressive Via Gara- baldi, named after one of Genoa's favourite sons. An even more favourite son of Genoa gets pride of place next year with a massive exhi- bition to mark Christopher Col- umbus and the 500th anniver- sary of the discovery of America. Spain has stolen a march with its long-planned 1992 Saville Expo which also has a Columbus focus; after all, it was Spain that provided the money for his great western voyage into the unknown. It is typical of the people of Genoa that they put the blame for Spain upstaging them in these celebrations squarely at the feet of the central govern- ment in Rome which, they claim, took too long to come up with the cash, or even to a sufficiently early commitment in principle to get the Colum- bus exhibition show on the detailed planning road. It snould be said, however, that the introverted and somewhat isolationist Genoese have little or no time for the central gov- ernment at the best of times. They feel - and indeed geo- graphically are - far removed from \"remote\" Rome. They will willingly accept substantial handouts from the centre, but will concede no right to inter- ference or instruction from the politicians in Rome. Being Italy, there is interference any- way, but it is less visible than in other Italian regions. That is part of the attitude, perhaps even the collective psychology, of most Ligurians, and it is probably a leftover from their own glorious and independent past. But the com- mitment from Rome has now arrived, if not all of the money, and the authorities in Genoa are preparing for the great 1992 Columbus event, even if the visitor doesn't detect a great degree of real urgency or much obvious enthusiasm on the part of most Ligurians. It will probably all come right on the day. Meanwhile, Genoa's conven- tional shipping business and, more importantly, ship-build- ing, is in decline. The old port is now obsolete, as are its origi- nal functions, and a new port is being created, with the main emphasis on container han- dling, ferry activities and improved handling of a still active oil and petrochemicals sector. The new grand plan for Genoa, where city will meet water almost without interrup- tion, is overdue, and it is fortu- itous that Expo 1992 has cre- ated a deadline, and provided much of the money. The old steel industry is on its way out, conventional port traffic is in continuing decline, and Genoa has already missed the boat in terms of the container revolu- tion to its southern neighbour- ing port of La Spezia which, while part of Liguria, borders on coastal Tuscany and increasingly seems to think and plan in that direction. The oil and associated petro- chemicals industries located in and around Genoa still sur- vive, and they did surprisingly well last year, but environmen- tal considerations are gaining ground. In today's rather rich Liguria, compared with Italy as a whole, the creation of new jobs often seems to take second place to the quality of living, and of life. The traditional \"black econ- omy\" appears to ease the bur- den on those out of work. And many of them are, in any event, supported by small busi- nesses run by their wives. Some 30 per cent of businesses registered with the Genoa chamber of commerce are run by women. Until its decline, Genoa's steel industry not only pro- vided the largest number of jobs in the city, but it also gave the Communist Party its great strength throughout Ligur- ia - and guaranteed the party a highly influential role in the administration of both Genoa and of the region overall. The party retains that authority today, exercised largely in an informal alliance with the Christian Democrats, although a combination of local, national and interna- tional events (not least recent happenings in the old Soviet Union) may well erode its power in time. Nonetheless, it seems some- thing of an anomaly that a city with more than a fair share of millionaires (and not in Italian lire terms) can co-exist so apparently comfortably with the Communists, even if the party has now changed its name. Much of the \"old\" money in Genoa is still invested outside Italy, mainly in Switzerland, but some in property in Britain and southern France. The declining number of industrial workers still sign on as \"regis- tered\" or nominal Commu- nists, but they go home at night to mostly comfortable environments. Genoa continues to have the highest percentage of home owner-occupiers in the whole of Italy or, by another mea- sure, the second highest. In a quality-of-life measurement, by the Tesitalia Institute, Genoa does well, sixth in the country, and ahead of Milan, Rome and Turin. Complacency? Perhaps. There were some disappoint- ments in overall economic per- formance last year, and not just in the Ligurian heart of Genoa, but also in the three other provinces of Imperia, La Spezia and Savona. But it was mainly due to the poor perfor- mance of state sector indus- tries, and regional GDP grew by some 2 per cent; almost in line with the national average. The small industries sector held up well, but there were setbacks in the agricultural field, mostly because the wrong weather at the wrong time hit the important flower- growing sector. There were also fewer tour- ists last year, continuing a trend in recent years. All signs point to the current year not being much better. The Gulf war, as elsewhere, has not helped and a big oil spill from a tanker off the Genoa coast earlier this year did not help either, although in the event the surface damage was less than initially expec- ted. By the average of Italian standards, Liguria's 1.7m peo- ple (well over half of them in Genoa) live a good life, and most of them know it. But until recently, they have ignored the growing problems of the 80s which have hit the region's heavy industries parti- cularly hard. They are now awakening to the challenge and to the need for change, pinning much of their hopes on attracting high- tech industries, mainly in the services area. The new World Trade Centre in Genoa is up and running and a free port is in the pipe- line, but even the optimists concede that it will be a slow, gradual process. In retrospect, most people admit that valuable years have been wasted.",

Some of these ambitious schemes are completed, others are due to be finished before the opening next year of the Christopher Columbus exhibition. Not surpris- ingly, the region's con- struction industry is booming. Big projects include resto- ration and renovation of the old port and old city, with Italian government funding of at least $850m. The projects are being administered by various government agencies. The new Carlo Felice opera house, with a seat- ing capacity of 2,000, is completed at a cost of $125m and ready for open- ing next month. Refurbishing the Ducal Palace, the government house of the 16th Century, in a co-operative enter- prise between the local authority and the private sector, is estimated to cost $50m - and probably very much more before the work is completed. The San Benigno office complex, a private devel- opment, is costing more than $400m. The World Trade Centre tower and the Italpianti building are already com- pleted and work continues on the new Shipping Tower. The Corte Lambruschini complex, including offices, a theatre and an hotel has been completed at a total cost to the private sector developers of some $210m. The Genoa international conference centre budget is $40m. The new port of Voltri, at a cost of $350m and rising, will have specialist high- tech handling capacity for container traffic.",

   "text_content" : "Dominick Covie examines developments in the port complex and historic city of Genoa, core of the Liguria region GENOA is lavesting heavily in modernising its port facilities and building new ones. The total spend, as with most Italian projects, will certainly escalate before final com- pletion, but the present estimate is for some (400m. The project involves both Italian and foreign companies, and the new role of the port In the Genoese econ- omy is to be that of a modern ser- vice centre, including shipping (with a big emphasis on container traffic), brokerage, technical and commercial assistance, port engi- neering and the already completed World Trade Centre. On the existing port business in Genoa: some 6,500 ships dock annu- ally and last year handled almost 44m tons of cargo, albeit a very large proportion (more than 50 per cent) of oil and related products. Some 500,000 lorries and 65,000 rail freight cars moved through the port, as did almost 2m passengers. There are roughly 40,000 port-related Jobs; 180 companies of ship owners; 280 ship brokers and 140 maritime agents and 3,000 trucking compa- nies. It's very big business indeed for Genoa, but it has been declining nwar the nact danlde and more. In 1980, Genoa handled more than 61m tons of cargo, including oil. Non-oil traffic has chaned little since then, although there has been a 20 per cent growth In container bosiness. Ligurla's second-larest port, La Speaia, has also seen a sharp decline In its total traffic. But it has had a spectacular rise in con- tainer an^\"d . thank largely to its modern facilities and a haro- nious industrial relations history which puat Genoa and Its workforce in the shade. Genoa has got the message, at last. A new, largely container, port is being built at Voltri, some six miles from the centre of the city as part of the long-conceived (1984) Port of Genoa Development Project The renewal of the old port, which dates from the 12th Century and is adjacent to the city centre, is being planned around four main features -a vast complex for next year's exhibition, \"Christopher Columbus: piex, iting back to t he ople of uenos direct aceeM to the harbour and with rage f leisure, sport and shopplIg flitids; a new termi- nal for caqlie shlp and a new ferry terminaL The ferry terminal, planned to be completed next yeu, will have a capacity to handle some 3,500 vehicles awaiting embarcation. It will feature direct on-terminal links with the national motorway system, ihm byrmah =theV f onceated citY ind\"ite Theenrance will have an automated check-in *stem, embar- cation cards being isued at the var- ious gates to 1 berths. The cruise terminal, scheduled for fnal completion in the mid-1990s, will be built within the facade of one of Europe's most famous mari- time stations (Ponte del Mille). Its vast and grand rooms with their high ceilings are being preserved and incorporated into the new ter- minal's design. Meanwhile. cargo traffic is to be centnred on the new port at Voltri, scheduled for completion neut year in time for the start of the Colam- bus Expo. Voltri is to be state-of-the- art, with specialist sections for par- ticular cargo, a high emphasis on automated handling and nearly automated customs clearance, with the whole complex linked to the national road and rail network. The port management, on presen plans, will mostly be in the hands of private companies, a structure which, it is hoped, will result in more efficient control and, impor- tantly, a better industrial relations pattern than in the old port. Mas- sive investment will come to noth- ing if Voltri cannot operate effi- ciently and competitively. Planning for and overlooking all this change is the Port Authority of Genoa a public body with a legal and autonomous status broadly sim- ilar to the port authorities in Lon- don and New York. The 1984 grand derign assigred to the Port of Ge noa a new structure at three levels; institutional, strategic and opera- tional. The Port Authority sets over- all policy, including development; strategy is handled by Porto di Gen- ova, while at the operational level there is a range of mainly private companies, but also with the partici- pation of representatives of the three main \"companies\" of port workers. They represent workers in containers, general freight and cruise ships; the bulk sector, includ- ing coal, minerals and scrap; and the ship repairsector. One thing seems certn; ia the new scheme of things, there will be fewer port workers. Finally, there is already an advanced data processing and tele- communications network within the port area, and to the outside world. The existing container terminals - Genoa was the first Mediterra- nean port to open a specialist con- tainer terminal, while La Spezia today ranks as the largest container port in the region - are inter-con- nected in a sophisticated fibre optics system. Sistemi & Telematica, the company hMndlng the port's com- munications, Is already planning to update the network for users, including the shippn companies, agents, frelght-forw era and rad haulage operators. The experimental phase of the first part of the port users' informa- tion system is complete, to manage the processing of operational and administrative documentation, including cargo manifests, container handling information (loading, unloading, gate in and gate out), orders, booking and invoicing. And Genoa will be the only port in Italy with its own teleport net- work; a ground-based system will link the city via satellite to data, voice, image and text transmission systems serving the principal ship- ping centres of the world. A computerised service, Portotel, already provides customers with data and other information on port operations and traffic. In shipping, time is money; Genoa is hoping that its massive investment in port facill- ties and technology will bring back the business.",

   "text_content" : "GENOA, the core of Liguria, has a famous past but a some- what uncertain future. The port city saw the start of the industrial revolution in Italy, albeit almost a century after Britain's, and British commer- cial contact and direct invest- ment assisted early industrial development of the region. Trade then at least was still following the flag; Britain's first consulate in Europe was in Genoa, although others make a similar claim for Flor- ance. The present British con- sul in the city, Mr Michael Wicks, is sticking to his guns. What is not in dispute is that Genoa was the first part of Italy to go down the industrial road; the region produced the first motor car, the first mili- tary field tank and the first aeroplane. The Rinaldo Piaggio company is still very much in the business of making highly successful aircraft. But being first did bring its own problems. The rich early rewards for Genoa, and indeed in other parts of Liguria, pro- duced in time a complacency when, ultimately, change was desirable and then became essential. The early 1980s saw the decline of Genoa's heavy indus- tries, particularly in the steel sector, and with high costs and the absence of technological change undermining the tradi- tional strergth of Genoa's port, neither employers nor the by- then powerful trade unions could see - or wanted to see - the writing on the wall. Managements in the state sector companies were frozen, awaiting political directives from on high in faraway Rome. Confrontation was the order of the day, most employers stood 4 aloof, and the trade unions stood their ground. Curiously, the situation was much less confrontational in the administration of the city. There, the Christian Democrat party, sheet-anchor at national level of every government since the Second World War, and the Communists, in essence shared the spoils and provided patronage to their respective supporters. They still do to a large extent in Genoa and through- out Liguria, even it they don't go out of their way to advertise the fact. There are, neverthe- less, coalition alliances, although one can sense that the power of the renamed (at national level) Communist party in the region may be on the slide. International events aside, not least in the Soviet Union, the very sharp decline in employment in Genoa's tradi- tional heavy industries can not be helping the Communist cause, and Liguria also has a steadily ageing population and a very low birth rate. The cosy management-union relationship was fine in a ris- ing market and with little com- petition from low-cost produc- ers and suppliers elsewhere in the world. But the unions, sup- ported by the local Communist party, continued to demand, and to get, rates of pay which made the cost of the end prod- uct - whether in steel, ship- building or the handling of port traffic - such that the business went elsewhere. Many employers acquiesced in the private bargaining and perceived mutual self-interest in order to buy industrial peace and in the hope of sub- sidy handouts from the Rome government. This tidy, and until lately widespread, Italian arrange- ment was rudely interrupted by the European Commission in Brussels with its directives limiting the freedom of EC member governments as to what payments they may make to prop up ailing industries or to support new ones. Genoa, for one, has felt the squeeze, most particularly in the key steel sector but also indirectly in port activity and in ship- building. The response in Genoa, which represents well over half of virtually everything in Lig- uria, from population and the available labour force to elec- tricity consumption and the handling of external trade, has been an intermidable debate and, until quite recently, little else. City and regional politicians, the big state sector companies, private industrialists and the trade unions argued long and apparently inflexibly as the area's industrial base declined even further. Everyone was agreed that something drastic needed to be done although no one could or would agree on what. The key port workers, in an uncanny parallel with an ear- lier era by dockers in London which ultimately killed its port, continued to press for higher pay while rejecting new working arrangements, partic- ularly for handling container traffic. They finally reached an agreement of sorts on con- tainer traffic earlier this month, but it may be aca- demic, at least for a while, since most of the container business has already moved south to the more accommo- dating and less expensive port of La Spezia, which now has more business than it can han- dle. The smaller port at Sovana could handle more business, but theoretical co-operation between Liguria's four prov- inces stops short of such trans- fers. Now, suddenly, the overall mood has changed, but in Genoa no one quite knows why. The best guess, and it is supported by Prof Giovanni Persico, president of the regional parliament for Lig- uria, is a general if long-over- due recognition that the crisis facing Genoa could be terminal if something drastic is not done. Confrontation has turned into co-operation between rep- resentatives of state industries and the private sector, within the chambers of commerce (chambers throughout Italy are relatively well-financed public bodies) and even, to a degree, among the political parties. The mood change has also had a focus in the need for Genoa to do something to mark the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas by the city's own son, Christo- pher Columbus. Next year's Columbus Expo has dictated action, and where better than in the declining port area. The old port is being turned into a vast exhibition area, modern port facilities are being created on another site, includ- ing a new terminal for han- dling containers, an updated terminal for cruise and ferry shipping, a marina and improved facilities for ship repairs and, of course, the already completed if greatly underemployed nearby Genoa airport. The May 1992 deadline for the start of Expo is concentrat- ing minds wonderfully, not least in Rome which has to pay for most of the work. Fortu- nately, much of what is being planned for the Columbus exhi- bition will live on, giving a big and long overdue renewal to the vast Genoa port zone. The whole process is being rolled into a progressive pro- gramme of urban renewal gradually opening up access to the old city, and to improving Genoa's overall amenities. It is an overdue process right now. If next year's Expo attracts the expected tourist crowds - one semi-official esti- mate talks of more than 3m visitors - goodness knows where they will all stay. A rela- tively routine trade show in Genoa is worst than the Frank- furt Book Fair when it comes to finding accommodation. It will be even harder to get into the first night (next month) of another great event in the life of today's Genoa, the opening of the new Carlo Fel- ice 2,000-seater opera house. The original Teatro Carlo Fel- ice was destroyed by wartime bombing in 1943/44. It has taken 40 years, and some $125m, from the initial decision to go ahead to the completion of the new Carlo Felice. The people of Genoa will probably be arguing about its exterior design - stark and totally incompatible with the old city - 50 years from now, but inside it is a modem, func- tional and artistic wonder. Appropriately, the new house will open with II Trovatore since Giuseppe Verdi, while not a son of Genoa, was a great admirer of the port city. Genoa's determination to restore the Carlo Felice and to remember Christopher Colum- bus, shows that the city can focus on the big issues - even- tually it may even accomplish it in urban and industrial renewal. A start has been made at last. Dominick Coyle",

Last year it lost an estimated $219m in the process and it would like to get out of the business, just as another IRI company, ILVA, also a very sizeable loss-maker, wants to quit steel-making in Genoa. Traditionally, Genoa has been the city of shipbuilding and ship repair yards, but no more in any great volume. This is in part because fewer ships are being built, but also owing to intense competition from lower-cost yards in other coun- tries. The situation has not been helped by the EC Commission in Brussels which (as part of a much wider investigation) is currently looking at the big state subsidies enjoyed by Ital- ian yards, both state-owned and private. But the biggest immediate squeeze is on the demand side, and this has been aggravated in very great measure by cut- backs in the so-called \"mili- tary\" area, namely vessels for the Italian navy, principally warships. Military procurement has for long been the sheet anchor of the Italian (and Genoese) ship building industry, and the orders have now Just about dried up as part of a general curtailment of military expen- diture against the background of what one trade union spokesman in Genoa described dejectedly as \"peace breaking out all over the world.\" Some shipyards have tried to switch operations to associated areas, including oil rigs, but the competition in that area is also intense. Others have re-tooled to aim at the leisure side of the indus- try, including yachts and plea- sure craft, but this end of the business has long had special- ist and quite profitable provid- ers in Italy, including a num- ber of small yards throughout Liguria, and few of the com- mercial and military shipbuild- ers have made the switch suc- cessfully; fewer still have made it profitably. Some large orders have been coming through for cruise ships, but the emphasis is on size, and the Genoa yards just have not got the capacity. Costa Crociere, among the top six in the world cruise mar- ket and run by a family very much a part of Genoa, has had to go to Fincantieri's Marghera yard in Trieste for its new 50,000-ton vessel, the Costa Classica, which is to be aimed Ip at the profitable Caribbean e cruise market. A second Costa at order has also gone to the al Marghera yard, although the - company has placed some d smaller orders with the Genoe n ese shipbuilders, Mariotti. Dd The ship repair side has been g more encouraging, althought here again there has been a o sharp cutback in business from d the Italian navy and intense at ompetition from yards in other s countries. But Genoa still has one of m the largest and best-equipped i- ship repair centres in the a- whole of the Mediterranean, lu c~ d rhlgbui#lirg mb rMp npllr y~k Tfniltonullyi Qknofl mx operating out of three yards at Gadda, Giano and Levante cov- ering a total area of some 425,000 sq m. There has been a heavy investment programme in the yards in recent years to improve logistics and technol- ogy. The area has six dry docks with improved lifting equip- ment, and employs some 3,000 workers in a wide range of spe- cialities. The workshops can operate on a 24-hour shift basis \"and are ready to go into action at any time, thus avoiding delays for waiting ships.\" Riparazione Navall Porto di Genova SpA acts as main con- tractor, co-ordinating work on repairs and conversions among some 50 Italian companies whose main activities include repair and fitting out yards; steel structure work; electro- chemicals and electronics; woodwork and design; and hull cleaning, painting, flooring and sand-blasting. But as in Genoa's all-but-de- funct steel industry, costs have been escalating in the ship repair and conversion operations. Business, inevita. bly, is going to lower-cost yards in other countries. Direct and indirect govern. ient subsidies have concealed sharply rising costs over recent ears in a business which is highly labour intensive. There are few people in the Italian (or indeed the world) shipping business who ques- tion the quality and skill of Italian .shipyards - indeed teams of workers frequently go abroad on contract, including to the US. But the big question mark today is on price. Dominick Coyle",

   "text_content" : "THE STEEL industry and the port city of Genoa have been inter-dependent partners for the past four decades, but divorce is imminent. The industry has been the area's biggest single employer for more than 30 years, but no more. What's left of the steel industry in Genoa will have gone entirely within the next couple of years as part of the curiously - or encouragingly, perhaps - named \"Project Uto- pia.\" For the city it will be very much an end of of era; \"Uto- pia\" is the plan to oversee the final dismantling of all steel production in Genoa and, hope- fully, its replacement with a range of high-tech industries. It is quite a challenge. Steel came to Genoa as part of Italy's grand industrial design after the Second World War. The De Gasperi govern- ment of the day decided that post-war Italy needed to be self-contained in steel produc- tion in order to power the country's industrial recon- struction and development. Genoa was earmarked as the centre of the new steel indus- try, given its impressive port and its proximity to the indus- trial heartlands of Turin and Milan. A site of some 250 acres was won from the sea in a massive land reclamation and engineer- ing project to establish a vast steel complex as part of the giant state holding company, the Istituto per la Ricostru- zione Industriale (IR). No one at that time worried about environmental issues or the massive industrial eyesore on the Genoa skyline; jobs were more important, and in due course the steel works pro- vided more than 15,000 of them in a city, be it said, with no industrial tradition. The port of Genoa was devel- oped and expanded to accom- modate the steel industry and, by government decree, port workers servicing directly the steel industry were designated as special-category employees outside the normal recruitment range of the trade unions. The unions were, however, free to organise the workforce in the steel industry itself, a unique arrangement which inevitably led to industrial con- flict. The port and the steel industry have rarely been short of disputes ever since, but more especially in recent years with the decline of steel production and of traffic through the port. There were many reasons for this decline, and not just the drop in national and worldwide demand for steeL Under pressure from the trade unions for ever higher wages, and also a fair measure of restrictive practices, Genoa became a very high-cost pro- ducer of steel in the face of new low-cost operations in other parts of the world. Pro- duction processes failed to keep up with technological Belching smoke and Industrial pollution became the concerns of the late 1970s change and the conversion to specialist steel fabrication was too long delayed. This was not, incidentally, because of incom- petent management, but due to the usual processes of delay by IRI's ultimate paymaster, the central government in Rome, to approve change and author- ise necessary investment. Environmental issues, too, began to surface; jobs were the priority of the 1950s, but belch- ing smoke and industrial pollu- tion became the concerns of the late 1970s. Genoa production was by then already at a competitive disadvantage with low-cost producers elsewhere, and the high investment required to make the Genoa plant more environmentally friendly, including the fitting of massive industrial filters, was seen to virtually put the steel business out of business - certainly in terms of price. Politics, as ever in Italy, also played a key part. Pressures to open up the depressed southern part of the country, encouraged by regional politi- cal influences, brought a gov- ernment decision to establish a second big steel production centre in Italy. This was at Taranto, on the instep of the Italian boot more than 1,000 miles from Genoa and more than half that from Rome itself. Taranto was and remains almost as far south as you can get without falling into the sea. The arguments favouring Taranto were entirely political, and the decision was made in the face of strong and compel- ling industrial counter-argu- ments advanced by the man- agement in Genoa. But all to no avail. Not for the first time, and certainly not the last, the IRI group was used by the politi- cians in Rome as an agency of not only industrial but also social (and political) policy; the argument that Taranto, rela- tive to Genoa, would be a low- er-cost producer convinced no one, but the political case won in the end. The remnants of steel pro- duction in Genoa are now to be moved south as part of what most people in Genoa believe is a blatant private deal between various factions of the Chris- tian Democrat party. What they are waiting to see is the price; what is Genoa to get for losing its last toe-hold in steel after almost 40 years? This being Italy, no one is say- ing - and, for the record, no one is even prepared to say that a deal has been done. What is sure is that Genoa is to lose what is left of its loss- making steel industry, and the administrators of the city are seeking a new Utopia. The emphasis now is on attracting high-tech alterna- tives to replace the lost jobs, although employment in the steel sector had already dropped to little more than 3,000. The new Zona Franca (free port) in Genoa is the brainchild of Professor Victor Uckmar of the University of Genoa (he has advised both the Soviet and Chinese governments on the establishment of free port zones) and is intended to make up for the jobs lost in steel. Its shareholding combines the local Chamber of Com- merce, the Genoa Port Author- ity and FILSE,the financial agency of the regional govern- ment of Liguria. It is shortly to get a new and powerful addi- tional shareholder in the shape of Liguria's largest banking group, the Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia. Outside of Liguria, the loss of the steel industry is seen as a regional disaster; in Genoa itself, few seem to be greatly concerned, perhaps accepting the inevitable, but also arguing that a city without an indus- What Is Genoa to get for losing Its last toe-hold In steel after almost 40 years? trial tradition was never a suit- able home for steel in the first place. Better, it is said, to get back to roots, back to what Genoa has always done best - trad- ing. Technology-based indus- tries may not quite be trading, but are closer to the culture of the city than steel production. It is although the steel indus- try was imposed on Genoa against its will, and its time has gone. Trade unions apart, no one seems overly con- cerned, and the environment lobby is certainly happy.",

   "text_content" : "Many uIr Inly - ncn aun lamMuuu naUv vullow aug rurwnswe SANDWICHED between the sea to the south, the mountain ranges leading to the Apen- nines in the east and the Alps to the west, Liguria forms a narrow arc around the Gulf of Genoa, creating one of Italy's tourist magnets. Rarely more than .20 miles wide, Liguria includes over its 155 miles in length many of Italy's most famous seaside attractions and resorts. Genoa, at the tip of the are, divides the \"Riviera di Ponente\" to the west from the \"Riviera di Levante\" to the east. Both are equally famous, although the eastern sector has the more up-market image now, largely thanks to the VIP status of Portofino, the pictur- esque little port which hosts the villas of many of Italy's rich and famous. Tourism accounts for some L4,000bn in annual turnover, making it one of the region's leading money-spinners along- side commerce and industry, says Mr Carlo Arcolao, director of Liguria's tourism develop- ment office. The mix of tourism is heavily weighted towards Ital- ians, who accounted for 77 per cent of all hotel bookings last year. That figure excludes those who maintain second homes in Liguria. These vary from huge villas in the hills above Portofino owned by the Agnellis, Pirellis and the like, to the scruffy concrete bee- hives along the coast hurriedly built in the early 1960s to tap a newly-rich market. Despite its good climate and fine scenery, Liguria's tourism is experiencing tough times, with the number of visitors in summer declining steadily. According to figures for San Remo, one of the main resorts in the region, the number of Italian visitors in July was down by 9.25 per cent while that of foreigners decreased by 7 per cent. Mr Arcolao says the fall in summer tourism, especially among foreigners, has been compensated by an increase in wintertime visits by Italians. However, the net effect is still a reduction. The problems in the tourism industry have both general and specific causes. Summer tour- ism has been losing ground for some years as Itallans have opted for other parts of the coastline or foreign destina- tions. The slight economic downturn in the past 18 months has also made visitors more cost-conscious on the Italian Riviera. This year has also biought specific problems. The collision in April between a Sardinia- bound ferry and a tanker was followed within days by the fire on the supertanker \"Haven\" which sank in the Ligurian sea with thousands of gallons of crude oil on board. Pollution was limited, but the bad publicity, coming just as many families were plan- ning their summer breaks, stuck. More recently, there was panic in some areas following the surprise sighting of a shark off the coast. Special circumstances also partly explain the fall in the number of foreigners. Tradi- tionally the most numerous of Liguria's foreign visitors, the Germans have this year been much less evident owing to new opportunities at home and greater cost-consciousness. Although Liguria's resorts are now known primarily as summer destinations, their touristic origins are almost invariably winter-based. A mild winter climate and plenty of sun were certainly among the reasons which led to the development of resorts such as Santa Margherita on the Rivi- era di Levante or Rapallo, slightly inland. Further along the coast are the famous \"Cinque Terre\", five tiny fishing ports, only some of which are accessible by car, which combine scenic beauty with a sense that life has stood still. Barely scarred by development, the five, linked only by a seaside rail- way and a beautiful clifftop path, sum up the best of what Liguria has to offer the visitor. The western Riviera is slightly different, with much more evidence of commerce and industry, as well as hun- dreds of horticulturalists, par- ticularly around San Remo, which has become Italy's prin- cipal flower market. Many beauty spots remain. Heading west towards the French border, the backdrops become increasingly spectacu- lar. San Remo, despite its unchecked growth, still main- tains an old town perched on a hilltop above the more recent urban sprawl, as do Bordighera and Ventimiglia further west. The fact that all three have strong similarities with the old quarter of Menton, the first town on the French side of the border, reflects the western Riviera's often common roots with its French neighbour, the C6te d'Azur. However, haphazard develop- ment in Italy over the past 30 years means the French Rivi- era, stretching from Menton, via Monte Carlo to Cannes and beyond, is often the more appealing destination. Such proximity poses a prob- lem for Liguria. For while local authorities and regional administrators strive to keep up standards and offer new ser- vices, they are painfully aware that France is just a hop away. For increasing numbers of Italians, the C6te d'Azur often offers not only much better infrastructure and civic ameni- ties, but also the appeal of being \"foreign\". The fact that French hotels, restaurants and services, even on the Riviera, are often better value than their Ligurian counterparts has just added to the pressure."

   "text_content" : "IN GENOA they say it is easier to get an audience with the Pope in Rome than with the now very distinguished native architect, Renzo Piano. The fact that he lives in Paris may not help, but then again Piano is just as likely to be in Amsterdam or Osaka in Japan. The jet-setting image is understandable, the reality is somewhat different. Piano, 54, is master-minding part of the exhibition in Genoa to mark the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Ameri- cas by another of Genoa's favourite sons, Christopher Columbus. He is doing it with style and love; he is immensely proud of his native city. He is also using the Colum- bus Expo to start a process of urban renewal in Genoa and, in particular, to bring city and sea back together, to open up the waterfront to the people. He has about $600m of public funds for the project, much of it extracted from the Italian government after a series of meetings with Guilo Andreotti in his capacity as foreign min- ister and then as prime minis- ter. Piano moves in elevated circles but, he stresses, only to get things done; to get projects off the ground. The son of a successful Genoa building contractor, young Renzo initially disap- pointed his father by opting for architecture rather than enter- ing the family business. The disappointment did not last. Having just turned 30 and still quite unknown, Piano won, with Richard Rogers, a competition for the design of the Georges Pompidou cultural centre in Paris. His career immediately took off. The Pompidou centre was followed by other distinguished assignments, and by many which represented a challenge to Piano. He has designed one- family homes in Milan, the Menil Collection museum in Houston, the Olivetti office block in Naples, the Bercy commercial centre in Paris and the new football stadium in Bari in the south of Italy. The Columbus Expo project in Genoa is the most pressing project but Piano and his team (up to 100 architects and sup- port staff in Genoa, Paris and Tokyo), are also handling a new science and technology museum in Amsterdam, the Kansai international airport in Osaka, rehabilitation of the old Fair Quarter in Lyon and of the Fiat Lingotto factories in Turin. Piano found time to talk with the Financial Times in the new Renzo Piano Work- shop outside Genoa where, in association with Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organi- sation), he and his team are studying the potential uses of natural substances, and espe- cially national fibres, in con- struction. In part this is a reflection of his own obviously strong commitment that design and construction should work with and be part of its environ- ment, not in conflict with it. He gives the impression of working on it 25 hours a day, and expecting little less from his colleagues. Of the trappings of his obvi- ous commercial success, Renzo Piano shows none, apart per- haps for his small cigars. A modest reward. Dominick Coyle",

   "text_content" : "A holding company projected towards the future. CAMELI GROUP The entrepreneurial activity of Cameli Group can be traced back to the beginning of the twenties, during the first post- war period. Carlo Cameli, progenitor of Cameli family, founded his first company in the city of Genoa. Initially, he devoted himself to the sea freight ac- tivity with success, and, with the help of his numerous sons, constituted one of thN largest Italian shipping families wi- thin a few years. Once the Company got over the inevitable sea freight crisis caused by the Second World War, Filippo Cameli, now leader of the Group, con- tinued and widened the sea ac- tivity in the early fifties. At that time, the large-sized fleet of tankers attained was one of the first and most modern of the country. In the early seventies, the economic background changed as a consequence of a recur- rent international crisis that in- evitably affected the sea freight activity. The new generation of the family orientated the ac- tivity towards oil trading, with gradual disengagement of the Group from the shipping sector. Under these circumstances, Cameli & Co was born in 1977. It soon expanded thanks to the contribution of profes- sional and managerial abilities that allowed the achievement of an important position wi- thin the new sector of the ac- tivity. Due to a successful consolidation, the Group be- came interested in new initia- tives ranging from industrial to financial and real estate sectors. The configuration of the Group, subdivided by operat- ing areas, can be schematical- ly summarized as follows: Cameli & Co. is the holding Company on which three sub- holding companies depend: - Cameli Petroli & Co. Sri (Limited Liability Com- pany). - Gerolimich S.p.A. (Joint- Stock Company). - Rodriguez S.p.A. (Joint- Stock Company) together with NAI - Navigazione Alta Italia. Cameli & Co. was constitut- ed in 1977 with its office in the city of Genoa. It still keeps oil supply strategically within its activity, through the com- panies it controls. Cameli Petroli & Co. Sri. with its office in the city of Genoa, manages all Italian petroleum activities of Came- Ii Group either by itself or through the companies it con- trols. It mainly deals with crude oil importation as well as its refining, distribution and wholesale marketing. The refining process takes place either at a refinery in the city of Mantova that belongs to the Group, or at Isab in Melilli a refinery of which Cameli Petroli owns 20% Hence, the products are dis- tributed all over the national territory, through a network of companies that commercialize industrial and heating products controlled by the Group, and also through a network of points of sale hav- ing a convention with the Group as well as with other companies. By the takeover of Energy S.p.A. (that has commercial- ized solid fuel for a long time), Cameli Petroli assumed a leadership position in the trade and import of pit-coal and pet-coke. In this sector, also NAI has a logistical participa- tion with a new initiative (the Terminal Rinfuse of Genoa Port). GerlMk S.p.A., quoted on the Stock Eachange since 1900, is the finance company of the Group. In this way. the Group controls al the indus- trial activities with prevailing subdivision in the sectors of electronics and shop-automa- tion, nursery gardening, and auto components. Sweda Electronic Industries design and produce electronic equipment such as cash registers widely used in the world market (in Italy, Sweda Group holds 25% of the mar- ket). With Floramiata, Gerolimich manages the big- gestand most modern nursery gardening Company of the world, fed by geothermic ener- gy through a complete know- how, unique in the sector, that belongs to Floramiata En- gineering. The aim of the company is to put said know- how at the disposal of opera- tors of public and private bod- ies of the market. Its commitments to protect the environment are also remarkable. As a matter of fact, due to the sensibility of public opinion with regard to the \"environment\" subject, Gerolimich, through con- trolled Technologic Initiative, has developed a series of in- dustrial initiatives for the col- lection and disposal of special, toxic and noxious urban waste. Rodriguez S4.A., recently purchased by Cameli Group, has its office in Messina and it is a sub-holding company in charge of all main shipping and maritime activities. The company, quoted on the Stock Exchange since 1991, holds the block of shares of NAI Navi- gazione Aha Italia, also quoted in the Stock Exchange. Up to now, all activities of the Group regarding the maritime sector were referred to said company. Here follows the list of Companies belonging to Rodriguez S.p.A.: Rodrigez Cadteri NavaH which is a world leader in the design and building of hydrofoil speed boats and fast means to transport passengers, is carrying out a programme of advanced fast means to transport passengers and au- tomobiles (car/passengers ferries). SNAV is one of the main world companies in the fast navigation field that operates in the most important national and international routes, such as the Napoli Gulf, minor is- lands of Sicily, FPtine Island and Denmark. The company is being expanded to the Greek, Egyptian, Tunisian and Spanish routes. The use of Rodriguez hydrofoil speed boats represent the best pro- motion for Rodriguez Cantieri Navali Company. Alimar S.r.l. (Limited Lia- bility Company), area of re- cent activity, aims at the development of traditional navigation for which motor ships for passengers and me- ans are used in international routes between Italy-Spain and Italy-Tunisia. In the shipping sector, NAI, through its controlled Petrol- navi Company, has two petrochemical ships of 12,600 TPL designed according to the best modern technologies; it has boosted the off-shore sec- tor thanks to an increasein the fleet and its use in several safe- ty operations in which it par- ticipated in defense of the sea. The drainage of Genoa and Livorno Gulfs asaconsequence of the well-known accidents,is an example of said operations. According to the interests shown by Cameli Group for the coal market, that has in- teresting prospectives in a near future considering the realiza- tion of a technology of clean utilization, NAI has operative- ly entered into the manage- ment of the Terminal Rinfuse of Genoa port (being part of the privatization programme of the Genoese quay), to which all the operations regarding pit-coal and pet- coke will refer.

   "text_content" : "San Remo: uncontrolled development during the boom years has made the town an eyesore ONCE called the \"pearl\" of the Riviera, San Remo, the main tourist resort between Genoa and the French border, has long lost its lustre. San Remo's fate is an object lesson in how unbridled capi- talism, and possibly corrup- tion, can swiftly ruin even the advantages of a fine location and a kind climate - and in the process create urban chaos. Uncontrolled growth in the 1960s and 1970s has turned what may once have been a pearl into a jungle. By dou- bling its population to 60,000 in less than 30 years, a quiet town, discovered by the British aristocracy as a winter watering-hole in the 19th Cen- tury, has degenerated into a summer dive. San Remo in the winter may still have its charms. Mr Antonio Sindoni, the local councillor responsible for tour- ism, stresses that the winter season is nothing like its sum- mer equivalent. Summer-time San Remo is to be avoided. Inadequate roads and parking, and ribbon devel- opment outside the immediate city centre, have turned the town into a nightmare for motorists and pedestrians alike. Uncontrolled development during San Remo's boom years has left the town an eyesore. As many of the 19th Century villas occupied by notables such as the Nobels and even Kaiser Friedrich III of Ger- many, fell victim to the bull- dozer, their successors - a motley collection of flats, hotels and offices - not only lacked harmony, but appeared scruffy, too. Mr Sindoni makes no bones about the mistakes of the past. There was \"an assault of cement\" in the 1960s and 1970s, he recalls. The city \"lost con- trol of itself' and developed all the problems of any town \"which grows too fast\". The cause was partly politi- cal, but probably not all of San Remo's own making. Inade- quate zoning laws and lax planning controls allowed spec- ulative developments in much of Italy at the time. Meanwhile the Italians' new wealth cre- ated an upsurge in demand for second homes. San Remo is a town with \"the sort of material and eco- nomic interests of a much big- ger city\", he says. Its politi- cians failed to come up with \"an adequate response\" to the material challenges they faced. There is no better focus for such \"material\" interests than the casino, built decades ago to stop Italian money flowing across the border to Menton and Monte Carlo. The casino, along with the annual late-Feb- ruary music festival, are San Remo's two biggest draws, and probably explain why its repu- tation is so much bigger than it deserves. Mr Sindoni tries to look on the bright side. New car parks are being built to help reduce the roadside chaos. Traffic should also be relieved once a new by-pass is completed. The new road will ease con- gestion on the Via Aurelia, the old Roman route which cuts through San Remo and is still the primary route along the Ligurian coast. The road, much of it in tunnels, will lie between its clogged predeces- sor and the Autostrada cutting through the hills to the north. San Remo's third, and more distant, hope, is to remove the coastal railway line which runs parallel to the Via Aurelia along much of the western Riviera. While the occasional train arguably adds character, the railway divides the town from the sea and creates a thin \"belt of iron\" hinting more of industry than tourism, accord- ing to Mr Sindoni. Shifting the railway will allow the creation of a \"green belt\" by the sea and reinforce efforts already made to improve San Remo's waterside facilities, he says. Those will also help the appearance, but hardly trans- form, San Remo's meagre and grossly-overcrowded beaches, which tend to be sandwiched between existing facilities such as the park and the railway station. Seekers of endless sand should look elsewhere. However, some efforts are already bearing fruit. Good design and careful planting at the marina have brightened up a previously shabby area. But \"the pearl\" still has a long way to go. Haig Simonian",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR rose yesterday after the US Commerce Depart- ment reported a smaller decline in durable goods orders than had been expected in the market. The 3.8 per cent fall in dura- ble goods during August com- pared with expectations of a 4.5 per cent drop and the 11.2 per cent increase in July. After the relase of the offi- cial data, the dollar moved up towards the highs struck the previous day, reaching DM1.6855, or about a pfennig above the opening levels in Europe. However, the dollar only momentarily held at the higher levels. There was not much buying interest behind the dol- lar's advance and, as analysts examined the figures, doubts began to creep in as to whether the initial optimism had been overdone. Once a large increase in defence orders was excluded, durable goods fell by 5.Z per cent. Furthermore, durable shipments and unfilled orders data did not point to a strong rebound in the economy, said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank. With many of the latest eco- nomic reports pointing towards a weak recovery in the US, there are fears that Federal Reserve will again cut interest rates.

Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the Spanish peseta recovered slightly amid suggestions that the Bank of Spain had been intervening in the currency markets. This was later denied by the Bank of Spain. The D-Mark fell back from early highs of Pta63.25 to Pta63.10, against a previous close of Pta 63.14. Sterling was steady amid signs that the markets are begining to discount the possi- bility that there will not be a general election this year. Talk that a reduction in rates will not take place until later in the year also boosted the pound. Sterling closed higher at DM2.9150 from DM2.9125; at SFr2.5400 from SFr2.5325; at FFr9.9375 from FFr9.9125; but eased to $1.7335 from $1.7450; and to Y231.00 from Y231.75.

   "text_content" : "Wal Street AFTER TUESDAY's late gains, the stock market settled back into a tight trading pattern yesterday, with share prices finishing slightly lower at the end of a quiet session, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.05 at 3,021.02. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended down 0.83 to 386.88, while the Nasdaq com- posite of over-the-counter stocks edged 1.34 higher to 527.81. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 154m shares. The news that durable goods orders in August fell by 3.8 per cent had little impact on mar- ket sentiment, in spite of the fact that analysts had been predicting a bigger decline. The data showed that the manufacturing sector contin- ues to recover, which might have helped to counteract the negative implications for the equity market of the overall drop in orders. Among individual issues, Upjohn climbed $3% to $47%/ on volume of 2.3m shares, aided by heavy trading in its call options. Of the five most active call contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, three were Upjohn calls. Investors' interest in the drug company appeared to have been prompted by specu- lation that Roche, the giant Swiss drug group, might make a bid for Upjohn. General Dynamics, which has been a strongly supported stock of late, climbed another $3'/ to $49% in active trading on reports that the company expects third quarter profits to come in above analysts' fore- casts of $1.50 a share. The defence contractor also said it was considering buying back some of its common stock or raising its dividend payout. Three stocks received a big boost from strong quarterly earnings reports: Lennar jumped $2% to $26 on third quarter profits of 51 cents a share, up from 32 cents a share a year ago; Best Buy Company added $3% to $28% after reporting that second quarter profits had doubled from a year ago to 20 cents a share; and Horizon Healthcare put on $% to $7% on news of its fiscal first quarter net income of 9 cents a share, well up on the 4 cents a share reported a year earlier. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, Fortis, only recently floated, climbed $1% to $18% ahead of what is expected to be an upbeat presentation in San Francisco by Mr Gordon Cle- mons, chairman of the com- pany which provides medical cost containment and managed care services for the workers' compensation market. Fortis went public in June when 1.5m shares were offered at $10 each. Century Telephone Enter- prises rose $1% to =28%, enjoy- ing the after-affects of Tues- day's agreed bid for another cellular telephone company, Metro Mobile, by Bell Atlantic. Knowledgeware dropped $1% to $17% after Montgomery Securities cut its rating on the stock and reduced its estimate for the company's fiscal 1992 earnings. Going the other way was Oracle Systems, up $2% at $13% in huge volume of almost 7m shares, after it reported net income of 2 cents a share for the first fiscal quarter, against a loss last year of 22 cents a share. Canada TORONTO share prices contin- ued their recent pattern of lacklustre sessions, closing down slightly in moderate trading. According to preliminary fig- ures, the composite index was off 8.02 to 3,390.08 as declines led advances 267 to 244. Volume of 19.3m shares was behind the previous 23.5m and trading value slumped to C$223.5m from C$286.1m. Gold stocks reversed their gains of the past two sessions, recording a 0.85 per cent index decline."

   "text_content" : "INTERIM RESULTS swayed investors in Italy and France yesterday, as bourses ended slightly lower, writes Our Mar- kets Staff. MILAN saw individual declines on company results and forecasts, and was unable to respond to the good news - excellent half-year results from Sip, the telecoms utility, which came too late in the day. The Comit index fell 2.03 to 541.31. After Pirelli SpA's slide into the red, reported late on Tues- day, the shares officially closed L100 down at L1,810, and a later fall to L1,775 left them down 7.1 per cent on the day. Olivetti, which analysts say is likely to announce a first half loss of between L30bn and L65bn tomorrow, dropped L59 to L2,911. Fiat's chairman, Mr Gianni Agnelli, said that its first half results for 1991 would be poor, which was expected, and that its second half would be worse, which was not. The shares fell only L24 to L5,305 on the ses- sion, but lost another L70 to LS,235 in the after-market. Sip's profits, at L604bn com- pared with analysts' expecta- tions of L460bn or so, said Mr Michele Pacitti of County Nat- West. This should improve the mood, he said, especially where Sip and its majority share- holder, Stet, are concerned. PARIS was cautious after a rash of company results. The CAC 40 index reached a day's high of 1,893.35, before going into retreat and closing at 1,877.93, down 7.30. Turnover was moderate, ris- ing from FFrl.8bn to about FFr2.2bn. Of the total, FFr273m was accounted for by Alcatel Alsthom, which rose FFr4 to FFr610; a Paris-based broker issued a strong recommenda- tion on the stock. Suez, the holding company, lost FFr10.70 or 3.1 per cent to FFr329 in volume of 266,940 shares, on worries about next FT-R4 urotrack 100 .

STOCKHOLM fell for the sixth consecutive session, as the market continued to wait for news on the formation of a new government. The Affirs- vArlden General index slipped 3.7 to 1,063.3 as turnover picked up to SKr339m from SKrl84m. Nordbanken lost SKrI to SKr35. After the bourse closed, the bank announced its eight- month results and estimated that credit losses for 1991 would be SKr9.5bn, compared with a previous forecast of SKr3.6bn and analysts' expec- tations of about SKr5bn.

   "text_content" : "The market has run out of steam in spite of good economic news, writes Kevin Brown USTRALIA's stock market bulls are still waiting for the rally a which many had forecast ear- Slier this year, in spite of falling inflation and clear signs of an end to the 18-month recession. The market has risen by just over 20 per cent since the r beginning of the year, mostly driven by an improved infla- tion outlook, caused by weak b demand and a deal with the r trade unions on wage restraint , for tax cuts. However, the , advance has run out of steam, 2 and there seems little prospect that the All Ordinaries index s will rise to 1,800 or even 1,700 t by the end of 1991, as some t optimists were forecasting at t mid-year. r Since peaking at 1,5913 in t August, the index has fallen to t 1,502 during the week of Presi- dent Gorbachev's incarceration in Moscow, and bounced back to the 1,560 level for most of the current month. Yesterday it closed at 1,562.0, up 6.5. The market seems to have f been unimpressed by the gov- r ernment's success in getting inflation down to 3.4 per cent in the June quarter, perhaps because of worries that a one percentage point easing of offi- dal interest rates to 9.5 per cent early this month may renew inflationary pressures. Significantly, the yield on the benchmark Commonwealth 10-year bond has held up at around 10.6 per cent since the easing, reducing the incentive for fund managers to reweight their portfolios towards equi- ties. The 10-year bond yield fell to 10.41 per cent on Tuesday on the release of optimistic infla- tion forecasts for the third quarter, but is still above its low in May, before the recent cut in official interest rates. Inflation is not the only thing worrying the market. High real interest rates, com- bined with political stability, have attracted strong overseas support for the Australian dol- lar, which recently broke through the 80 US cents barrier and is widely forecast to con- tinue rising. The stronger cur- rency is bad news for the resources sector, which accounts for more than 36 per cent of market capitalisation, and is a strong determinant of general market sentiment. The effect on profitability can be severe: for example, Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, US$ per A$ 125 120 115 110 105 100 95 rebased 0.85 0.80 0.75 mÂ·_Â· ~_(I ~'~''\"~~\"~ calculates that its bottom line profits fall by around A$25m for every one US cent increase in the value of the local dollar. On top of these general wor- ries, the market has been unsettled by a string of poor results from companies such as TNT, Foster's Brewing and Pacific Dunlop. Many are fore- casting further problems dur- ing the current year. For exam- ple, Foster's said on Monday that its restructuring pro- gramme would be hampered by depressed profits, and BHP forecast on Tuesday that prof- its were likely to fall in the short term. Nevertheless, the economic fundamentals are moving in the right direction. Most of the leading indicators have turned upwards in recent weeks, including those for employ- ment, housing starts and retail sales. Most economists are forecasting a subdued recov- ery, beginning in the current quarter or the first three months of next year; analysts say that the improvement in confidence should feed through into the market shortly. Mr Tim Monckton, institu- tional dealer at Prudential Bache, says the index should reach 1,600 to 1,650 in the first quarter of next year, especially if falling inflation expectations pull the 10-year bond yield closer to 10 per cent. However, Mr Graham Rog- ers, investment manager at Colonial Mutual Life, says the market will have its work cut out to supply sufficient funds for the large number of flota- tions and placements likely in the next 15 months. The market is soaking up the recent A$1.3bn Common- wealth Bank flotation, and A$1.7bn in rights issues by the National Australia Bank and Pacific Dunlop. But some ana- lysts say that further equity issues could total between A$10bn and A$15bn, including more than A$lbn for the GIO Australia insurance group and A$1.6bn for the Woolworth's supermarket chain. The gradual improvement of the past nine months will prob- ably continue, but the new stock coming on to the market could use up the supply of available funds, reducing the scope for further market gains, says Mr Rogers.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo HIGHER bond prices triggered active arbitrage-linked buying yesterday, and share prices rose on activity by foreign investors and individuals, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 243.72 at 23,577.42, after open- ing at the day's low of 23,403.65 and reaching a high for the day of 23,623.91. Volume grew to 400m shares from 320m. Some domestic investors, such as life insurers and trust banks, were also seen trading for the short term. Advances led declines by 620 to 352, with 158 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 15.23 at 1,812.85, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 2.33 firmer at 1,386.38. The recent popularity of over-the-counter shares spread to high-priced small compa- nies. Traders said the price movements reflected window dressing by institutional inves- tors ahead of the interim book closing. Among video game makers, Sega climbed Y900 to Y13,300 and Nintendo Y800 to Y14,300. TDK put on Y70 to Y5,770 on reports that the company's pre- tax profits for the current year through to next March would rise 11 per cent. Large-capital issues and elec- tricals retreated on profit-tak- ing. Nippon Steel lost Y6 to Y412, Mitsubishi Heavy Indus- tries Y12 to Y737 and Fujitsu Y15 to Y978. Dainippon Ink & Chemicals, the most active issue of the day, rose on continued interest over the company's develop- ment of an Aids drug. Other drug-related issues also gained, with Meiji Seika, the confec- tioner which developed a can- cer drug recently, advancing Y110 to Y1,370. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun SOUTH AFRICA THE CONTINUED strength of the financial rand hit curren- cy-linked industrial stocks. Barlow Rand lost B1 to R50.50 and Richemont 25 cents to R30.55. The industrial index dropped 66 to 4,085, but the all-golds eased only 9 to 1,146. announced yesterday that it is to replace six component issues in the Nikkei stock aver- age. The reshuffle will be effec- tive as of October 1. Taito, Katakura Industries, Teikoku Sen-i, Matsuzakaya, Shochiku and Toho will be replaced by Kumagai Gumi, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Topy Indus- tries, Tomen, Nissho Iwai and Sankyu. In Osaka, the OSE average closed 150.89 higher at 25,879.45 on volume of 35.8m shares. The index was lifted by small-lot buying of smaller capital shares backed by favourable earnings projections. Nippon Densan rose Y450 to Y6,700 on expectations of an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the current year on strong sales of its micro preci- sion motors for computers and facsimiles. Fuso Pharmaceutical Indus- tries gained Y20 to Y1,220 on projections of a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year, supported by steady sales of its blood and body fluid drugs. Roundup THE UNEXPECTED easing of monetary policy by New Zea- land's central bank produced the main feature in a quiet region yesterday. NEW ZEALAND saw steep falls in domestic wholesale interest rates, a plunge in the New Zealand dollar and a rise of 26.21 or 1.9 per cent in the NZSE-40 index to 1,400.18 as turnover doubled from NZ$15.8m to NZ$31.8m. Most blue chips posted solid gains, especially those which had suffered in recent weeks because of the poor outlook for company profits. Fletcher Challenge, the for- estry and resources concern under pressure because of downgraded earnings fore- casts, gained 7 cents to NZ$3.32. Brierley Investments, which produces annual results today, rose 3 cents to 96 cents on the heaviest individual mar- ket volume of 3.8m shares. HONG KONG registered its lowest turnover in eight months, HK$650m against HK$719m on Tuesday, as the Hang Seng index eased 1.86 to 3,902.33. After opening marginally off, the market spent the day trapped in a narrow 15-point range. Analysts attributed its somnolence to a shift in focus by overseas institutions from regional markets to the rebounding Tokyo market. JAKARTA rose 1.7 per cent in active trading, the index adding 4.39 at 258.21. Semen Gresik, the cement producer listed on the exchange in July, rose 100 I M I rupiah to 3,750 on 400,000 shares traded. It reported a sharp fall in profits for the first eight months, although the year-ago figure included pro- ceeds from the sale of its Semen Cibinong holding. SINGAPORE drifted lower as institutional investors contin- ued to liquidate their outstand- ing positions. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 3.78 down at 1,377.46 after light volume. SEOUL was pulled above intraday lows by the rumour of an impending summit meeting between the South Korean president, Roh Tae-woo, and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Il-sung. The composite index closed a net 3.63 off at 680.30. TAIWAN fell on profit- taking, the weighted index end- ing 23.51 lower at 4,790.68. MANILA's composite index showed an advance of 7.08 at 973.67 after a volatile day.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor AFTER some initial nervous- ness, the UK stock market rose sharply yesterday on the back of selective buying of the inter- national blue chip stocks. By the close, the FT-SE Index was within three points of the 2,600 mark, so briefly regained on Friday. The absence of the feared rights issue helped the stock market but did not protect the food manufacturing issues from selling pressure. Equities opened sharply higher, encouraged by Wall Street's overnight rally from early falls and by confirmation that Abbey National was mak- ing its foray into the life assur- ance business by way of a Â£285m cash purchase of Scot- tish Mutual Assurance. While the deal does not put new money into the stock mar- \"d D@iNme Sep2 Oct 10 Od 24 Sep2 Oc 11 Oct 2 Odc7 Oct 21 Nov 4 ket, it implies a confident view of the UK financial sector, which has attracted good investment support over recent months. Market confidence was also encouraged by the absence of the widely predicted rights issue from Asda, the troubled food supermarket group. How- ever, fear of a fund-raising move in the Â£300m-plus range by Asda was not ruled out but merely postponed by hints in the 'stpck market that the group will this week announce the long-awaited appointment of a new chief executive, per- haps in tandem with a take- over move from Tengelmann, the German food retailer which controls A&P Stores, the 1S food supermarket company. Completion\" of an equity trading programme, printed at the close of the previous trad- ing session, also helped share prices, albeit for a while; the market advanced by 12.5 points on the Footsie scale as Warburg Securities, the UK based securities firm, followed James Capel, the institutional broking house, in drawing attention to the favourable bond-equity rating of the Lon- don stock market. The early rise in equities ran out of steam and the gain was cut back by about one third. Buyers then returned and, in the absence of negative news from either political or corpo- rate fronts, share prices moved ahead sharply. By the end of the session the FT-SE Index was 21.2 points ahead at 2,597.8. The final hour of trad- ing saw London moving ahead confidently, with ICI and BAT Industries standing out well. Seaq-reported turnover increased to 596.2m shares from the 452.4m of the previous session. The Seaq total, which takes in both retail and intra- market business, has proved a somewhat unreliable guide to equity activity this week. Stock Exchange statistics show that Tuesday's retail busi- ness remained relatively unim- pressive, totalling Â£813.8m, compared with last week's daily levels of around Â£1.5bn. Yesterday's trading volume totals were swollen by substan- tial broker trades of stocks in oils and food companies. In the food retailing sector, heavy business in Asda was accompa- nied by trades of 2m shares apiece in Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Argyle. Strauss Turnbull, the UK securities arm of Societe Gdndrale, has been prominent among Loindon houses taking a bearish view of the food retailing sector. A large block trade in Brit- isa Petroleum was also noted as having boosted turnover among oil sector stocks. But most of the blue chip issues benefited from Wall Street's steady performance in early trading, reflected in a gain of just over two Dow points in London hours.

   "text_content" : "TAKEOVER speculation again boosted Asda yesterday as turnover rose to 42m shares, with many dealers convinced that at least one substantial stake, and possibly more, had been accumulated in the trou- bled grocery chain. The shares closed 4% higher at 64p amid suggestions that Tengelmann, the German retailing group, would bid for the company and also under- write a rights issue. Several large lines of stock were absorbed by the market and once again US brokers took a keen interest, with Leh- man Brothers and Goldman Sachs both said to have been buyers. There was also talk that a new chief executive would be announced on Friday, although in the absence of the widely predicted appointment, each day brings forth ever more exotic suggestions as to who will take over operational con- trol of the company. The revival of bid specula- tion in the food sector also lifted Cadbury Schweppes, which rose 9 to 413p. BAe hints There was keen two-way trading in British Aerospace in advance of the departure of Professor Sir Roland Smith as chairman. The share price ini- tially dipped to 420p but stead- ied to finish unaltered at 425p on turnover of 2m. One defence specialist said the removal of Professor Smith \"might see the share price pop up a bit, but that would be a knee-jerk reaction\". He added that the arrival of Sir Graham Day would not solve the group's immediate problems. Abbey deal pleases Abbey National rose to within a whisker of its all-time peak of 311p, before ending a net 13 ahead at 306p, after the bank confirmed long-running stories that it was interested in buying a life assurance arm. Turnover in Abbey reached 6.8m shares. The company announced the purchase of Scottish Mutual, for Â£285m. It was rumoured to have run its slide-rule over a number of life companies, notably London and Manches- ter, in recent months. The purchase price and strategy behind the move drew praise from most analysts. Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Daiwa, the Japanese-owned stockbroking house, said Abbey had \"paid a full price for an extremely sound business with excellent long-term potential. It ties in with Abbey's long-term philos- ophy of sound and solid activ- ity.\" Another specialist described the move as \"a rea- sonable deal at a sensible price\". Glaxo was a conspicuous weak spot as sentiment was once again hit by a dispute among doctors over the safety of a class of asthma drugs called beta agonists. The com- pany produces an old but popu- lar treatment, Ventolin, as well as Serevent, seen as stra- tegically significant for the group's growth. Recent scientific surveys have suggested a correlation between heavy use of beta ago- nists and deaths of a small proportion of sufferers of severe asthma. In response to this evidence, the International Asthma Council (IAC), has issued guidelines recommending the use of anti-inflammatories, another class of asthma treat- ment. The guidelines have this week been attacked by the UK National Asthma Campaign. Glaxo lost 11 to 1351p. Standard Chartered shares gave their best performance for some time, closing 21 higher at 371p, with the market respond- ing to suggestions that UAP, the French insurance group, and Liberty Life, the South African insurance concern, were about to launch a joint bid for the bank. The two insurance companies recently formed a venture, Rockleigh, to take control of Sun Life, the UK life assurance group. Heavy trading was reported in the oil and gas sector. Brit- ish Gas moved up strongly to reach an all-time high of 280p, shrugging aside worries about increased regulation from industry watchdog Ofgas. Turnover was 11m shares. BP was the heaviest traded stock in the sector, with 15m shares changing hands as insti- tutions responded to conflict- ing advice from top analysts. Kleinwort Benson and James Capel were said to have been keen supporters of the majors yesterday. BP settled a penny harder at 330p, while Shell, in spite of worries about the divi- dend, moved up 4 to 494p. A number of influential Lon- don broking houses bought the power generator stocks. Turn- over was sharply higher throughout the list, with 21m shares apiece traded in National Power and Scottish Power. The latter, still boosted by a recent bullish note from BZW, gained a penny to 114%p, while the former, a strong performer over the past week, after keen demand from US and UK brok- ing firms, climbed 5 to 170p. One of London's top agency brokers was said to have given the sector a big push, overpow- ering some determined selling from Japanese brokers. Power- Gen put on 4 to 179p on 6.1m and Scottish Hydro-Electric improved to 116p on 8.7m. Thames TV's recent good run, on the back of steady buy- ing of traditional call options, came to an end. Thames eased a penny to 224p, leaving the gain over four sessions at 26. Maxwell Communication Corporation recovered some of the ground lost in the wake of a critical television pro- gramme. The shares improved 6% to 170p, still 4 below Fri- day's close. Recent option activity was largely on the put side. Anglia TV firmed 4 to 199p as the company announced a Â£1.5m deal to make children's adventure game shows for Ger- man and Dutch broadcasters. Anglia said the contract \"is believed to be the biggest sin- gle UK order for foreign lan- guage television programmes\". Unrest in Zaire prompted a FT-A AIIShare Index 1300 1150 Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Excluding: Intra-marke business & Overseas turnover 600 400 200 0 bounce in copper prices and in turn helped shares in RTZ to climb 8 to 546p. The stock was also helped by a technical posi- tion in the traded options mar- ket. The view that metal prices would be generally firm pushed Lonrho 6'/2 higher to 245p and Charter Consolidated 10 better to 548p. The absence of sellers in many larger company stocks exaggerated gains in the more volatile constituents of the FT-SE 100. Among those to benefit were Great Universal Stores, 33 stronger at 1338p, and Reuters, up 19 at 953p. Another volatile security, Rothmans, continued to bene- fit from analysts' recent recom- mendations and climbed to its second new high in succession, adding 9 at 1121p in thin trade. Other stocks with tobacco interests attracted good demand. BAT Industries climbed 13 to 658p in above average trading volume and Hanson firmed 3% to 227p as a busy 6m shares changed hands. BOC advanced on the back of a recommendation earlier this week from James Capel and after recent weakness. The shares moved up another 14 to 593p in good turnover. Other leading chemicals also rose, ICI adding 15 at 1305p. Bell Atlantic's move for Metro Mobile, the cellular radio group, continued to boost Vodafone, which climbed to 391p before closing 12 up at 387p; turnover was a heavy 4.9m shares. Vodafone's former parent, Racal Electronics, attracted some exceptionally strong two-way demand - 9.2m shares traded - and closed fractionally easier at 55'/p. Cable and Wireless rose 15 to 565p with a hefty 6.2m shares traded, after a couple of influential broking houses said the stock had lagged the sector and the market recently. MEPC led the property sec- tor higher after announcing it had let part of its Alban Gate office development in London at Â£45 per square foot, with a 30-month rent-free period. The shares added 11 at. 506p, their best level since May. Incheape receded 6 to 376p. There was talk that one securi- ties house was recommending a switch into Harrisons & Crosfield (up 2 at 156p), but the stock has had a good run and it seemed more likely that investors were merely taking profits. ECC, which gave a presenta- tion at County NatWest yester- day, gained 4 to 476p. News of a rights issue pushed Porter Chadburn down 6 to 77p. The company intends to raise Â£20.3m by issuing 32.3m new shares at 65p. Courtaulds, which had been weak following a recommenda- tion by James Capel on Mon- day to switch into BOC, recov- ered 9 to 472p. Hoare Govett is keen on the stock and argues that it remains undervalued.

   "text_content" : "DERIVATIVES were boosted by heavy rolling-over of posi- tions in the Liffe and stock option expiry on the LTOM yesterday, writes Peter John. The September Footsie future contract opened strongly in the morning and maintained a large premium to the underlying cash market. The spread between Septem- ber and December, which has tended to remain around 45, m..oved sharply higher yester- day and there was a consider- able amount of rolling out. This prompted one US house o buy the September and sell he December. At the official close, the Sep- ember was at 2,608, a pre- Iium of 14 to the underlying index against its present esti- mated fair value of 6 points. The December closed at 2,657.5 with nearly 2,900 lots dealt. Stock option expiry domi- nated business on the LTOM and helped to boost overall turnover to 28,120 lots. Of the busiest seven stock options, all but Asda, which continued brisk on takeover speculation, were subject to September expiry. Abbey National was also affected by news of its purchase of Scot- tish Mutual. RTZ underlying shares were boosted by a buyer of Novem- ber 550 calls and a seller of November 550 puts."

   "text_content" : "Max Wilkinson discusses the lessons of a spectacular series of computer break-ins N SPITE OF much apocalyptic nonsense that has been written about the computer revolution, many people still do not understand how pro- soundly it is altering society. This is partly, no doubt, a reaction to the wilder predic- tions that computer robots will take over the gover- nance of earth. At the same time, the real world tasks which computers perform - airline bookings, payroll cal- culations, bank accounting, for example - have become so familiar that they cease to inspire wonder and awe. Then again, computers are more difficult to visualise than the other great achieve- ments of 20th century tech- nology such as fast cars, jet aeroplanes and television. Physically, they are just boxes of electronics, getting smaller every year. And the programmes that make them run are, to most users, obscure and invisible. In their book, Cyberpunk, two American journalists have found an exciting way to penetrate the barriers of computerspeak and to open up the networks to the imag- ination of the ordinary reader. Their method is to tell three stories of criminals who penetrated the global networks, in one case with spectacular, and in another with devastating effect. CYBERPUNK by Katie Hafner & John Markoff Fourth Estate Â£14.99 368 pages Greed, however was only a minor motive of the anti-he- roes of this book. They were driven by a sense of wonder and obsessive curiosity about the vast new world which opened up on their home computer screens via the telephone line. They were all hackers who exploited lax security in big university computers to pen- etrate the telecommunica- tions networks which link hundreds of thousands of systems in America and Europe. Their targets included military installa- tions, weapons research and commercial secrets. Specialised telecommuni- cations networks were devel- oped in the last two decades to enable researchers in dif- ferent institutions to share data, programmes and ideas. They also allowed research- ers with a small terminal at home to dial up their institu- tion's computer and exploit its full power. They might also instruct the office machine to connect to a col- league's computer thousands of miles away. Once con- nected to the distant machine the researcher could operate this, too, as if he were sitting in the next room. Of course, safeguards were built in: researchers would be allocated passwords which entitled them to access only certain sectors or functions of a particular system. These functions were arranged in a hierarchy of security which presented an irresistible challenge to the Cyberpunk hackers and which are beginning to pose serious general questions for society. Take, for example, the systems operated by banks: many now allow customers to dial up from a personal computer, inspect their accounts and transfer funds. Obviously, the customer may not call up other peo- ples' accounts. But bank employees may inspect many different accounts. The bank manager has access to still wider informa- tion, for example, on the bank's profits. But above even the bank manager, there is another level, that of system manager or superu- ser, controlling the integrity of the machine itself. He can change programmes, alter data and passwords and could, if he were corrupt, switch funds from one account to another. So what havoc could an interloper create if he were able to dial up the computer with the name and password of a superuser. This is what the Californian hacker Kevin Mitnick was doing regularly in the early 1980s. Although he did not penetrate a bank, he did the next best thing, infiltrating himself as a superuser of the computers which controlled the Bell telephone system. This enabled him to re-route calls, alter telephone accounts, set up dummy numbers and even to monitor and frus- trate attempts by real super- visors to trace his calls. Mit- nick, a high school droll-out, an obsessive and a kind of genius, wrecked his mar- riage by hacking all night. He shifted his attention to \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t the network of academic and commercial computers, exploiting human errors and flaws in the operating systems. One simple trick was to sign on as \"GUEST\" (password \"GUEST\") then type in a clever little pro- gramme which would fool the computer into giving him \"superuser\" status. Another was to try standard passwords for system man- agers which were shipped with new machines, but which customers often for- got to disable. Mitnick's epic achieve- ment was to break through the highest levels of security to steal a new operating sys- tem of Digital Equipment's VAX computers while it was still under development. At least three experts knew he was stealing this huge pro- gramme and storing it, dis- guised as an index, on a uni- versity computer. They dared not interrupt him, until they could trace his location, because he had power to wreck the whole system. Although this soft- ware was extremely valu- able, Mitnick's motive seems to have been only curiosity. Mitnick was caught because, in a fit of pique, he disabled all the telephone lines into the firm where his confeder- ate was working. This was the last straw and the friend turned him in. Mitnick's story is followed by that of Markus Hess, the Hamburg programmer, who broke into hundreds of US computers including one at the Pentagon. He was tracked down by Clifford Stoll, a systems supervisor at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California. Stoll's book, The Cuckoo's gg (now a Pan paperback) is the better account, com- bining the excitement and detail of the chase with the authority of an expert. How- ever, Cyberpunk is a good book too, telling a comple- mentary story from the hackers' own perspective. The third story in Cyber- punk is perhaps the most alarming. It describes how Robert Morris, a Cornell Uni- versity student invented a computer virus, which on November 2, 1988 infected and shut down 2,000 inter- connected computers throughout the US. Morris was not evil. He did not use his virus, as he might have done, to destroy data or wreck programmes. But what about next time? Although security has been tightened, no system open to the network can be invulner- able. Moreover, computer systems are now becoming essential to many entirely new classes of user - jour- nalists, for example. From my office terminal, I can now call up a distant computer which will search every news item printed in several dozen newspapers and journals in the last three years. Thousands of journal- ists, salesmen and engineers routinely dial into their office computers over ordi- nary telephone lines. This book shows that a Mitnick or a Hess could easily obtain passwords and cause severe disruption. So in spite of its style of racy formula jour- nalism, Cyberpunk should make sober reading for many corporate executives. Computers may never rule the world, but their misuse could plunge parts it into a terrible mess.",

   "text_content" : "prepare their creden- tials for next year's World Environment Confer- ence, the lofty rhetoric slut- tering through their speeches will be secured firmly to the capitalist mast. Less spectacular than its recent eastern conquests, the free market's transformation of the meaning of \"green\" is hardly less remarkable. Armed with an array of novel political philosophies, the movement's voters came with hopes of radical change. They went, as it were, shopping: green con- sumers. The contradiction between green political ideology and the market is at the heart of Michael Jacobs' book (sub-ti- tled Environment Sustain- able Development and the Politics of the PFutre). But this is not for the strong- hearted, the realist who demands the impossible. Jacobs' outlook is unasham- edly pragmatic; the green economy he describes, through an explanation and critique of \"orthodox\" envi- ronmental economics, is \"feasible rather than Uto- pian\". Ostensibly, the market serves to generate equilib- rium; Jacobs stresses the dis- THE GREEN ECONOMY by Michael Jacobs Pluto Press Â£27.50. 312 pages equilibria it creates: between entrenched consumption pat- terns and environmental protection, between the needs of present and future generations, between North and South. Far from invisi- ble hand, this is the invisible elbow, clumsy and awkward, brushing aside the weak and occasionally breaking the china. Control of market forces is thus the key to a sustainable futture; ideology, as we have seen, is not enough. Jacobs presents his argu- ments by refereeing a con- frontation between the \"greens\" and the \"orthodox economists\", both of whom field their fair share of inval- ids. His story is cogent and persuasive, moving from an analysis of the environmen- tal crisis to elements of a programme for sustainabil- ity and prescriptions for environmental decision-mak- ing. Putting the economic issues in a political context, he demonstrates that the impediments to a sustain- able future are not lack of interest or recognition in principle of the problems, but lack of courage to make the necessary political tran- sitions. But what is the current orthodoxy? Textbook environmental economics now has sustainability in chapter one, and deals with concepts such as cost-benefit analysis and national accounting in terms not unlike those presented here. Jacobs is not keen on the language of economics, and tiptoes around the question - fundamental to arguments between green and growth - of how to compare environmental and human-made wealth. Most of his policy prescriptions would be familiar to orthodox analysts: But theoretical purity and profound analysis are not Jacobs' chief objectives. He aims to explain principles of environmental policy making and to clarify the process by which environmental concerns might get turned into action. By these criteria, this book stands out on the expanding shelves of green literature. William Canmaway",

   "text_content" : "IT IS OFTEN difficult to believe that interna- tional bankers belong to the thinking classes. The developing country debt crisis happened, accord- ing to Cheryl Payer, partly because too many of them glibly accepted the two con- ventions of development the- ory: that developing coun- tries are structural importers of capital and that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank know best how to set their econo- mies to rights. Her book is unlikely to convince many bankers that these conven- tions are wrong, but it is worth a glance if only because it challenges assumptions that are too easily just taken for granted. There is a fundamental flaw, Cheryl Payer argues, in the notion that developing countries should depend on borrowing. It leads to an accumulation of debt that can never be paid back unless the debtors saturate the markets of the industrial world with their exports. Developed countries are reluctant to face such a threat to their own employ- ment and industries, so they do not really want the money back. Instead they allowed the LENT AND LOST: FOREIGN CREDIT AND THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT by Cheryl Payer Zed Books Â£29.9518.95. 154 pages borrowings to pile up on the basis that debt could easily be refinanced, while new lenders would always be found to keep capital flows positive. In the end this was little more than a Pomzi-style con- fidence trick. When no new lenders could be found, the whole system collapsed. Developing countries are left having to make net pay- ments to their creditors of money which could be put to better use in their own econ- omies. Much of this argument is open to question. Ms Payer is not very forthcoming about preciely how develop ing countries should set about raising their living standards, though she obvi- ously prefers an inward looking approach in which foreign exchange is hus- bauded through a strategy of import substitution. That may have worked for South Korea, but it has been less helpful for India. Moreover, productive investment of borrowed funds by developing coun- tries ought in theory to boost local demand, creating new opportunities for export- ers in the industrial world. That would offset the pain of opening their own markets to LDC imports so as to cre- ate resources for repayment of debt. In other words, everybody should benefit, because the overall level of activity would increase. Nonetheless, this book should tweak a little at the consciences of both bankers and the offi- cials who promoted the great lending boom of the 1970s. Too little attention was paid at the time to the question of whether a a policy of indefi- nite borrowing was viable in the long run. If more thought had been given to this point, banks and their shareholders would be better off today. The debtor coun- tries would have faced ear- lier pressure to adust. That might have stemmed the capital flight which has been every bit as great a drain on their resources as debt service. Peter Montagnoe",

   "text_content" : "THIS IS a favourable review, though it may not seem so at first, of what is self-evidently a scholarly work. Not for the National Institute or for its Director, Andrew Britton, the instant verdict on a neatly defined slice of his- tory. 1974-1987 is a bleeding chunk. This study is thor- ough and provocative; but out of date before it appears. The Labour administra- tion of 1974-9 is given the benefit of an account of the Heath disasters which brought it to power, and ulti- mately brought it down, which lends necessary per- spective. There is not even a postscript, though, on the third Thatcher term, the one in which the wheels came off and the leader was replaced. We need a second edition, forthwith: for Mr Britton's approach is illuminating, but leaves us in the dark before MACROECONOMIC POLICY IN BRITAIN 1974-1987 by A J C Britton Cambridge/Natiorl Institute of Economic and Social Research Â£30 the curtain comes down. That is one cavil; and a second may seem fatal. The central conclusion which Mr Britton draws from this his- tory - that in spite of a pro- found change in rhetoric, actual policy actions went on in the same old way - seems to me not only debat- able but, deep down, pro- soundly superficial. It is true mainly in a sense defined by Mr Denis Healey fairly early in this period, when he com- plained of enslavement by the young men who write brokers' circulars. Responses to market pressures are not so much a matter of \"pol- icy\": as simply a conditioned reflexes. They are bound to look much the same from one market flurry to the next, whether the doctrine of the moment is called mone- tarism or Keynesianism, or even KaIdorism. However, even on Mr Brit- ton's restrictive definition of macroeconomics, the changes from high employ- ment to low inflation as the ruling objective of policy, from targeting growth and public expenditure in nomi- nal rather than real terms, and from including asset sales in the planning of the current fiscal account are substantial, and have affected both actions (between market crises) and outcomes. They are indeed noted and discussed, and the book ends with some impas- sioned words about the moral trade-off between inflation and unemployment. One is left, though, with the unspoken conclusion that a change to what Mr Britton would find a more accept- able set of objectives would make little practical differ- ence. Indeed, if he is right, there is really no such thing as macroeconomic policy, but only rhetoric - a view which Mrs Thatcher might secretly accept, but certainly not Labour. Odd, this. Why, then, do I recom- mend the book? Because it is in the honourable tradition of National Institute eco- nomic history - history as a learning process. The Insti- tute has always been com- pletely frank about its own forecasting errors and revi- sions, but in past periods these have been technical matters mainly of interest to other forecasters. In this period, forecasting and ana- lytic errors quite largely I mis 01 an u ua umasrvsauv wime amum zra rpnd Heath and Mariaret Thatcher guided policy. Economic models largely fell apart, since they could not keep up with the struc- tural changes which the Government was introduc- ing in an iconoclastic frenzy like that now seen in Russia. Policy, which in the Bret- ton Woods era had been regarded as a sophisticated automatic pilot became a Heath Robinson contraption of doctrine and string. To see all this lucidly displayed, to be reminded again of such flickering lodestars as DCE or Sterling M3, should be a source of something like nos- talgia to the old, amazement to the young, and an irresist- ible invitation to hindsight - which is the most enjoyable learning process.

   "text_content" : "ESS than three years ago, in the heady days of the late 1980s, it seemed to many that the UK economy had been trans- formed. The Thatcher eco- nomic experiment was declared a success, the UK purged of its \"British dis- ease\". The lady herself seemed invincible. Now little is heard of Mrs Thatcher's \"economic miracle\". For, as is now well known, the talk of this \"supply-side miracle\" in 1988 coincided with the peak of an old-fashioned demand boom. The policy errors which led to another boom-bust cycle are recorded by Chris- topher Johnson, ex-Chief Economic adviser at Lloyds Bank and an adviser to the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee of the House of Commons. THE ECONOMY UNDER MRS THATCHER by Christopher Johnson Penguin Â£5.99, 341 pages The first two chapters trace the main events of macroeconomic policy: the 1980-81 recession, the success in reducing inflation in spite of the abandonment of mon- etary targets, and the \"self-inflicted defeat\" of the late 1980s boom. Johnson also assesses the evidence of a supply-side revolution. In some areas he is damning- \"The curbs on public expenditure made the UK a country of private affluence and public squa- lor,\" while \"Tax reform was piecemneal and incoherent rather than being based on a long-term blueprint.\" Elsewhere he is more mea- sured. Trade union reform \"as necessary, he argues, although it did not remove the tendency to excessive nominal wage inflation. Overall he lists seven suc cessful policies, seven unsuc- cessful and seven mixed out comes. \"The government's record was thus\" he con- eludes, \"like the curate's egg, good in parts.\" The same could be said for Johnson's book. It is in its narrative, description and data. He provides ample sta tistical evidence with which readers can make their own judgments. Johnson's judgments are less carefully argued. The book's main weakness is that it does not analyse its post-war British economic history. The Thatcherite eco- nomic policy and record can- not be judged in a vacuum, and solely against the stan- dards set by the rhetoric which accompanied it, as Johnson is inclined to do. P erhaps this is deliber- ate. \"This is not an economic history or an economic analysis\" Johnson writes, \"although it draws on both disciplines. It is an attempt at political econ- omy.\" The suggestion, surely mistaken, is that political economy is a lesser disci- pline than economic history or analysis. Political econ- omy combines straight eco- nomic analysis and history with an appreciation of the political context and the power and importarce of economic and social ideas and pressures. In this broader context, the statement that \"Mrs Thatcher is likely to go down in history more for her political and military than for her economic and social record\" is surely wrong. The evidence of an economic mir- acle is weak to say the least; but it still makes sense to speak of'a revolution in the attitudes and practices which guide economic life in Britain. Ideas which seemed radical in 1979 such as the priority the Thatcher gov- ernment attached to provid- ing a stable, low inflation environment and the rejec- tion of macroeconomic pol- icy as an influence on the level of output and employ- ment in the medium term, are now part of the conven- tional wisdom. Mrs Thatcher won the argument over the aims of macroeconomic policy, but lost the argument over the means to control inflation. The prevailing wisdom now accepts that low and stable inflation is the priority of policy. Few dissenting voices are heard from the econom- ics profession in spite of the severity of the recession and the rise in unemployment. But the consensus was formed round the European exchange rate mechanism as the heart of monetary policy, and so excluded her. These central intellectual changes do not figure in the book. It seems that Johnson was too close to events to realise, even now, that he was caught up in this shift- ing consensus. Edward Balls",

   "text_content" : "DMUND DELL writes in his introduction that one of the rea- sons for publishing this book now is that many of those involved in the policy-mak- ing processes of the time are still alive, and can make their own rebuttals. Mr Dell was Paymaster General and the number two minister in the Treasury, then Secretary of State for Trade, in the Labour govern- ment of the mid-1970s which presided over one of the most thoroughly docu- A HARD POUNDING: POLITICS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS 1974-1976 by Edmund Dell Oxford Â£20, 306 pages mented of all British eco- nomic crises. He was per- haps the only minister to take the position from the start of \"Come IMF, and wel- come\". Economically, he was vindicated, though he thinks that Mr James Callaghan as Prime Minister threw away the political gains by refus- ing to hold a general election in the autumn of 1978. Nevertheless, the timing of the book is peculiar. We have already had the Castle and Benn diaries and a host of more economic books. It may be asked what the ex- paymaster general has to add, apart from a few snip- pets from his own diary and personal recollections. Mr Dell's book is remark- able for a sustained attack on Mr Harold lever, the one man in the Labour govern- ment who was thought to have high credibility in the City. His comments are not usually personal: he simply thinks that Lever was a poseur who got practically everything disastrously wrong. For example, Mr Lsever sought \"a prosperous diMquilibrium\", which Mr D-1 calls another term for extensive borrow-g\".

The Treasury is savaged for not coming up with strong advice early enough. Eventually some officials came began to support the Dell line. There really were meetings on a bench in St James's Park where officials spoke freely. . The Deli line essentially was that Britain was weak and ought not to rely on the goodwill of its Miends to bale it out. The government should have cut public expenditure from the start. In the end, sense prevailed. Mr Dell's prises go in this order to Mr Callghan \"for guiding the cabinet to a. mutually tolerable conclu- solan\": to Healey \"for his gal- lantry in battle against col- leagues with whom he largely agreed\", to the US for not \"be s too kind to a iend\" an1 to the MS for its \"unwavering determination not be to be deAected hrm what it believed to be right for the UK and for the inter- matlonal ecoammic system\".

   "text_content" : "R LOWELL Bryan, a senior partner at the management consultants, McKinsey and Co, has a habit of making unfashionably gloomy pre- dictions about the banking industry and being proved right. In 1987, he predicted that the US government would face a bill of at least $100bn from the collapse of the savings and loans indus- try. At the time, none of the Washington policymakers took him seriously. Now Mr McKinsey's prediction appears optimistic. In this lucid and stimulat- ing book he forecasts disas- ter for the entire US econ- omy unless the government initiates a wholesale reor- ganisation of the banking system. He estimates that as much as 25 per cent of US banks, controlling over $750bn in assets, are facing losses so huge that they will not be able to extend new credit no matter how low interest rates may fall and no matter how much con- sumers and businesses may want to borrow. His warning therefore is that US economic growth will not recover significantly unless the troubled banks are recapitalised immedi- ately and the banking sys- tem is overhauled. Though he supports much of what the US Treasury proposed for the reform of bank regu- lation earlier this year, he argues that the package is fatally flawed by its unambi- tious plans to change the system of deposit insurance. Indeed, interest in the book outside the US will stem mainly from his discus- sion of deposit insurance. In the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Com- merce International, bank supervisors throughout the world are reviewing their BANKRUPT by Lowell Bryan Harper Business $22.95. 315 pages systems for protecting depos- itors from losses when a bank collapses. There is no question that the US insurance system, which. effectively gives 100 per cent protection to deposi- tors, is at the heart of its banking industry's problems - and was also responsible for the collapse of the savings and loans. For the past nine years, since the enactment of the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act, all banks and savings and loans have in effect been underwritten by the government. They can offer absurdly high rates to attract deposits and then lend the money at absurdly low rate. The profitability of the their business has been irrelevant. Bankers knew that if their institution went bust, the government would bail out depositors. Legislation passed dur- ing the Depression and in the 1950s has been a severe obstacle to US banks restoring profitability by merging or diversifying into areas such as securities trading and insurance. To add insult to injury, insur- ance companies, store groups and securities traders have encroached on the banks' traditional business. Mr Bryan concurs with the Treasury's proposals to end the restrictions on US banks' ability to diversify or buy banks operating in dif- ferent states. But his most radical proposal is that deposit insurance should apply only to a new breed of bank, which he calls the core bank. This is a low risk insti- tution, which would concen- trate on taking deposits from individuals and on lending to individuals, small busi- ness and mid-size companies. Core banks' deposits would be prohibited from paying interest greater than the yield on treasury bills, allowing a recovery in banking mar- gins. If banks wanted to take deposits at higher rates, they would have to do so through separately capitalised sub- sidiaries, which would not be insured under the Gov- ernment scheme. A holding company would own both the insured bank and the uninsured bank. The com- pany's structure would include \"firewalls\", to pre- vent any difficulties at the uninsured bank from infect- ing the insured bank. The proposals are plausi- ble. But the book is flawed by its aim of attracting the general reader. Mr Bryan does not give a convincingly detailed explanation - one that would of necessity be complex - of how his fire- walls and the diligence of bank supervisors can pre- vent a holding company from leveraging its non-in- sured activities off the insured activities. He says research by his consultancy indicates that the core bank would be able to make a respectable profit, but there is little detail on the research. He is therefore unable to quiet the severe doubts of professional bank- ers about the profitability of this breed of bank. On the other hand, bankers are never happy concentrating on bread and butter borrow- ing and lending. If only they were. Robert Peston",

   "text_content" : "LL CASINOS foster fantasies of greed and grand delusions of invincibility, but perhaps none more than Wall Street, the biggest of them all. Such delusions were never more rampant than in the 1980s, the era of the junk bond. As a footnote to that shoddy period, here are two books about a couple of mod- erately successful (though third rank) take-over advis- ers. It is a measure of the times that the main claim to fame of one, Dennis Levine, was his secret second life as an inveterate insider trader, while the other, \"Mad Dog\" Jeff Beck, was a compulsive liar about himself. Levine's recounts his rise and fall, in this mildly inter- esting but oily, sentimental and self-serving autobiogra- phy. His arrest on insider INSIDE OUT: AN INSIDER'S ACCOUNT OF WALL STREET by Dennis Levine Putnam $22.95, 431 pages RAINMAKER: THE SAGA OF JEFF BECK, WALL STREET'S MAD DOG by Anthony Bianco Macmillan Â£17.50, 486 pages trading charges provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with the break- through that exposed the criminal activity of some of era's biggest takeover art- ists. Levine shopped Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur, to whom he had been passing information. Boesky, in turn, walked around wired with a hidden microphone as he tried to extract incriminat- ing statements from other erstwhile partners in crime. The domino effect ended with the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the flashy, upstart securities house, and the conviction of Michael Milken. Levine too worked for Drexel, but his career as a member of an insider deal- ing ring stretched back to his days as a junior in the industry and through sev- eral employers. It was care- fully planned, with trades carried out via an account with a Swiss bank in the Bahamas, and Levine was only caught because the \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t bank's employees began copying his stock purchases. What marked Levine apart was the sheer scale of his operation and the fact that he carried on even after he became a senior figure on Wall Street, earning $1m a year in legitimate wages. Why did Levine risk it? His answer, after rumina- tions inside a federal peni- tentiary, is that he was moti- vated not so much by greed - he did not spend the $10m he had stashed away in Nas- sau - but by a desire to match himself against Wall Street's heavy hitters. \"I came to view myself as an insider trading junkie.\" Believe it if you want, but to plead addiction is to deny personal responsibility, and Levine must have known that what he was doing was wrong. Unbridled greed seems the likeliest motive. Beck's character defect, which led to his downfall, was different - a compul- sion to tell outlandish lies. He called himself the \"Mad Dog,\" a nickname he was supposed to have acquired fighting in Vietnam. But all of this was fantasy, and eventually the Wall Street Journal exposed it as such. Shortly afterwards, Mr Beck resigned from his job at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Anthony Bianco, a reporter for Business Week, tells Beck's story at inordi- nate length and in tedious detail, straining to portray him as a symbol of the decade. Beck is too minor a figure to merit the attention. This is a big book about a rather small, sad man. Martin Dickson",

As biography, Trumped is anything but flawess. The TRUMPED by John R.O'Donnel Simon & Schuster Â£15.99. 348 author spent three years working for one of Trump's casinos in Atlantic City, eventually running the oper- ation before he quit. Now working for a rival Atlantic City property, he plainly dis- likes the hugely-indebted developer with a vengeance. Forget about objective vision or well-balanced insights. This is spit-and-tell. Of course, such a reaction may be understandable - at least, if even half of what O'Donnell writes bears any semblance to reality. For a start, Trump's management methods appear to owe more to New York street life than Wharton business school, which he once attended. O'Donnell's main conten- tion is that staff spend so much time coping with the businessman's tantrums, lust for publicity, and ll- judged deals that running an ellfficient business is inpassi- ble. The string of anecdotes is delivered with a vicious, -6 1 1 thbmt But, while O'Donnell's motves and emotions cloud the storyTrump and his ;b am, 0 d 0 eP',a three-dimensional entities. O'Donnell supplies a wealth of revealing detail. He makes much of Trump's obsession with cleanliness and dislike of crowds, for example. \"It would irritate him to distraction if some- one stepped up to whisper in his ear, or if an elderly woman who abandonned her slot machine in hopes of meeting him got close enough to peck him on the cheek.\" Then there is the apparent vanity. \"He once observed to Mark (Etess, another senior casino executive) that he considered baldness a sign of weakness. He gave a tube of gel he used to Mark, warn- ing him \"The worst thing a man can do is go bald. Never let yourself go bald\". By the end, the reader may not like Trump very much but at least he feels he has encountered someone whose drive derives as much from insecurity as from a Midas-like lust for gold It is all for more usle. in short tlis an unedify- lgbook, probably written for unsdtfig reams, and crstaunly muud on an une- diin business.

   "text_content" : "BOOK based on lecy- cled clippings, lit- A tered with small sac- tual errors, and written by a man whose most striking achievement is membership of a rock group called the Pop Tarts does not sound the most gripping read. In fact, Fenton Bailey's sketch of MiSke Milken and the junk bond world provokes some interesting reflections on Milken's rise and fall. Bailey worked briefly at Drexel Burnham during its glory days, though the clos- est he came to Milken was as an image on a videotape - his job at Drexel was to edit tapes to show to clients and staff. Later, he helped inter- view Milken, once, for a Brit- ish television documentary. His connection with the Junk bond czar is thus largely an electronic one - which is appropriate. One striking revelation of this book is the part videotapes played in Milken's world. Milken sent his wife an electronic billet-doux fronted by the newscaster Barbara Walters. Videotapes were a central element of the annual Drexel High Yield Bond Conference. The sinan- ciers and corporate execu- tives who attended were shown videotapes patterned after television commercials. The electronic enthusi- asms of the Milken world give an authentically Califor- nian feel. The Milken scan- dalfeels different from those perpetrated on the East coast or in Europe. Another Californian ele- ment is the relationship between Milken and the team of junk-bond traders he built in Beverly Hills, far from the established centres of US finance. Bailey defends Milken from the allegation that the the team resembled one of those strange reli- gious or political cults that THE JUNK BOND REVOLUTION by Fenton Bailey Fourth Estate Â£16.99, 282 pages flourish on the edge of the Pacific. But every piece of evidence he presents under- mines his argument. Bailey defends Milken and his team; he criticises virtu- ally everybody else associ- ated with the junk bond era, from the corporate raiders Milken created or nourished, to the Drexel staff in New York, and the journalists and prosecutors who brought him down. You do not have to be a Milken sympathiser to feel that the federal attorneys botched their case against him, and that, on the evi- dence presented, the sen- tence was harsh. But there is little scope for the theory that his actions were harm- less, let alone (as Bailey would have us believe) bene- ficial. The capital market he created was a false one, with conflicts of interest among the participants, and sus- tained by manipulation by Milken and his team. They financed some good busi- nesses but also many bad or excessively risky ones. To do so they routinely suppressed information, coerced or bribed investors, and gave themselves artificially high rewards. The book provides con- vincing evidence that Mil- ken's personal acts of char- ity were great, not merely in money but in time and per- sonal commitment. Milken is clearly not a Bad Man. But the junk bond world he cre- ated was a Bad Thing; and, whatever this book says, no amount of apologetics will make it otherwise. Peter Martin",

   "text_content" : "N 1955, the US accounted for 40.4 per cent of world production of machine tools. By 1988, its share had sunk to a paltry 6.6 per cent, less than that of Italy and little more than a quarter that of Japan. These stark figures from Robert Eckley's book tell a story of industrial decline 'which by now has so many echoes from other sectors that it is scarcely regarded as surprising any more. Yet Americans still find it intensely difficult to come to terms with seeing their country toppled from the position of economic and commercial supremacy it once enjoyed. Obsessed with their massive trade deficit and the ever-growing inroads by Japan into mar- kets once regarded as theirs almost by right, they are consumed with a sense of guilt and frustration. Typically this finds its expression in calls for pro- tection, but it has also led to nervous introspection. The question of US competitive- ness has become a hot sub- ject for policy debate. This book, written by an aca- demic who also has worked in industry as an economist with Caterpillar, seeks to add a new dimension to that discussion. It looks at the problem from the specific experience of seven leading companies that export capi- tal goods. Inevitably the choice of companies - IBM, Boeing, GE, Kodak, Caterpillar, Cummins, Cincinnati Mila- cron - is somewhat eclectic. It is not entirely clear that Kodak should qualify as a capital goods exporter. Nor is there necessarily a great deal of common ground for analysis, although there is a shared story of decline. Five of the seven have lost world market share during the last 20 years and the other two are more vulnerable to loss. General Electric and Cincin- nati Milacron have lost their world leadership position, though the other five are still on top. GLOBAL COMPETITION IN CAPITAL GOODS by Robert S Eckley Quorum Books, Westport CT, Â£27.50. 180 pages One of the encouraging starting points is that Mr Eckley does not believe that a retreat into protectionism is the answer. Indeed it may be counterproductive. Pro- tection of the US steel indus- try has added to the cost base of other manufacturers. For example, one-tenth of Caterpillar's costs are for steel. Nor did trade restraints affecting exports add much to the difficulties the company faced in the early 1980s, though the US shot itself in the foot during this period by banning the sale of pipelayers to the Soviet Union. The equipment was eventually supplied by its rival Komatsu. There is also an admission that some, at least, of the companies' problems were of their own making. IBM was slow to respond to the devel- opment of the middle range competitor by its competi- tors. Kodak failed to foresee the growth in demand for 35mm camera film while it concentrated too long on a camera format that permit- ted film to be easily loaded. Caterpillar, which was heavily dependent on exports, was hit by the rise of the dollar in the first half of the 1980s but it waited too long to diversify its sources of procurement. ne of the saddest tales is that of Cin- cinnati Milacron which has had to contend with a Japanese onslaught in the machine tool market. It would be easy to blame its troubles solely on assistance received by the its Japanese competitors in the form of strategic planning by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and through a Japanese policy of trade protection in the early stages. But this is only part of the story. Two other factors emerge. One is that US research efforts have been much less orientated towards user application and process than those of Japan; the other is that, far from helping, the active role of the US Depart- ment of Defence in procure- ment and research in the 1950s and 1960s may have been a hindrance. \"A problem arose,\" Mr Eckley writes, \"because of the sophisticated nature of Air Force machining require- ments and the vested inter- ests that developed in the early numunerically-controlled tools to meet its needs. This detracted from the evolution of simpler NC approaches by the absorbption of talent and the devotion of resources to highly complex systems for aircraft and automobile manufacturers.\" On this yardstick, Japan's success is just another spin-off from its low defence budget, but, as the book concludes, the reasons for US decline are complex and varied. One of the most serious remains a self-inflicted handicap in the form of deficiencies in education and training. Explaining why Motorola increased its training budget nearly ten-fold during the 1980s, Mr Eckley quotes a company vice-president as saying: \"Much of our work- force was illiterate. They couldn't read. They couldn't do simple arithmetic like percentages and fractions.\" Mr Eckley is confident that US industry can over- come its competitivity prob- lems, but Motorla's admis- sion that half its manufacturing and support staff in the US failed to meet basic primary school stan- dards in English and mathe- matics suggests there is still a long haul ahead, and one that is likely to be beset by continuing siren calls for protectionism.

His conclu- sion is: \"Although there are some problems in Tokyo, such as a higher cost of liv- ing and office space, Tokyo appears to be the fastest- growing and most attractive of the three major centres from the viewpoint of inter- national financial business.\" The book uses information up to 1989 when the Nikkei index was soaring, Tokyo was the largest stockmarket in the world and the mis- ideeds of Nomura and other brokers were only dark mut- terings of disgruntled for- eigners who could not get a foothold in the market.

Tatewaki's book also exposes a problem of letting Japanese academics write - it is extremely matter of fact to the point of being boring. It does not devote enough time to the idiosyncrasies and peculiar pitfalls of the Japanese market for unwary foreigners. The author could certainly have devoted more time to explaining the super- vision that the Ministry of Finance exercises, both direct and Indirect But if you want a guide to Japan's recent financial history (to 1989) along with an explana- tion of Japan's unique sinan- cial markets including the gensaki market, kingai trusts, tokkin funds and the huge Norinchukin Bank, it offers a good (though expen- sive) starting point. Tord Ride's book is a step- by-step guide to setting up a business in Japan, painstak- ingly explaining the advan- tages and disadvantages of representative offices, branches, licence deals, joint ventures or establishing a kabushiki kaisha (Japanese stock corporation). He includes some of the impor- tant forms that have to be filled in and deals with tax and labour laws as well as the tricky problems of nego- tiating with the Japanese., It offers an excellent starting point. Its main omis- sion is of any estimate of the costs of starting up in Japn. Kevia Rafferty",

   "text_content" : "OOKS ON the Euro- pean Community are neither easy to write nor, usually, easy to read. They tend to fall into the category of either short his- tories, with separate chap- ters on the Community's pol- icies, institutions and future development, or more speci- alised studies concentrating on one or other aspect, like the common agricultural pol- icy or economic and mone- tary integration. Three of the latest books on the EC tend to fall into the first category, particu- larly Prof Derek W. Urwin's The Community of Europe. It has the merit of being easily digestible, with good appen- dices of key dates, and it pro- vides a good historical intro- duction to the EC. But it does not pretend to offer either the deeper political insights of John Pinder's European Community or Loukas Tsoukalis's sophisti- cated analysis of the eco- nomics of integration in his The New European Economy. Pinder is an old war-horse of European unification, who makes no secret of what he describes as his \"neo-fed- eral\" views, while neverthe- less remaining laudably objective in his treatment of opinions opposed to his own. A former Director of the Pol- icy Studies Institute, and currently Visiting Professor at Margaret Thatcher's favourite university, the Col- lege of Europe in Bruges, Pinder is at his most persua- sive when analysing what he considers the inexorable nature of the Community's development towards eco- nomic and political union. He clearly sympathizes with the \"neo-functionalist\" view that, because economic problems are interdepen- EUROPEAN COMMUNITY by John Pinder Oxford Â£22.50/Â£6.99, 248 pages THE NEW EUROPEAN ECONOMY by Loukas Tsoukalis Oxford Â£25 333 pages THE COMMUNITY OF EUROPE by Derek W. Urwin Longman Â£18.991Â£8.99. 274 pages dent, the solution of one by joint action will lead to simi- lar action on others. Thus, one of the motives for the single market programme was the fear that internal Community free trade would be undermined by the multi- plicity of non-tariff barriers. Yet the author recognises that the \"linkage\" explana- tion of the Community's development underestimates the capacity of contradictory forces, such as the national- ism practised by General de Gaulle and Thatcher, to slow down or halt the march towards integration. Func- tionalists can explain the process of integration, but without reference to the final objective and the means to achieve it. Federal- ists, on the other hand, have a much clearer idea about the final goal and the steps which have to be taken. With some important res- ervations, Tsoulakis, a pro- fessor at the University of Athens and Director of Eco- nomic Studies at the College of Europe, shares the view that the integration process has its own dynamic, creat- ing pressures for a further De Gaulle: blocked the march to unification extension of common poli- cies and institutions. But he strikes a caution- ary note in his conclusion to an informative and percep- tive analysis of the project for economic and monetary union. Further integration, he warns, is likely to stum- ble upon the economic diver- gences and disparities in the EC. The Community has nei- ther the instruments nor the institutions to cope with the problems it faces. If it is to play a more active role in world affairs, it must be. endowed with greater sinan- cial powers, more central institutions and greater dem- ocratic control. In that respect he is very much on the same wave- length as Pinder, but it is not a message likely to appeal to supporters of the nation-state. Robert Mauthner Robert Maudwer",

Instead, the privatisation is held to have missed two opportunities. First, the gov- ernment failed to make the concept of sustainability a cornerstone of its energy pol- icy - it took instead a nar- row economic view; allowing the distribution companies a direct profit incentive to dis- tribute power, rather than forcing them to promote energy efficiency. Second, privatisation failed to destroy the corpo- ratist basis of the ESI, even by the limited aims of its own principles. It is perhaps too early to make a defini- tive judgment on the mecha- nisms designed to control ES, although further regula- tion seems inevitable. .Adrew Etwemar",

   "text_content" : "IRONICALLY, Horst M6n- nich has created a 1950s Cadillac of a book - very long, somewhat self-in- dulgent and with an excess of styling ornamentation - to portray a company whose reputation is all to do with conservative efficiency. Nearly 600 pages to chart the doings of a concern whose history spans barely 75 years imply an excess of detail, given that the author's divisions are wholly chronological. Of chapters which might have been devoted to specific issues of current close concern to a car maker - marketing, per- haps, or coping with the march of technology - there is no sign. Business readers hungry for further insight into the detailed strategies and means by which BMW, as a relatively small, albeit pres- tigious, manufacturer, might continue to survive in a globalising motor industry overshadowed by Japanese 'lean' production will thus emerge (eventually) from Mr Monnich's book largely dis- appointed. The BMW Story is long on anecdote and short on analysis of all but the past.The future is dealt with briefly in the form of epilogue. THE BMW STORY: A COMPANY IN ITS TIME by Horst M6nnich Sidgwick & Jackson Â£25 588 pages Not unreasonably, per- haps, for a book meant mainly as a history. Yet BMW is a living entity, and part of one of the world's great industries at a time of profound uncertainty about the shape of the future. To that extent, it is an unsatis- fying format. Monnich's epi- logue raises plenty of ques- tions about the future in the form of a quoted dialogue with Eberhard von Kuen- heim, BMW's current chair- man, but he forgoes the bur- densome task of investigating the possible answers. Perhaps Mr M6nnich is exhausted by his labours, given that the work was seven years in the writing. It is based, he proclaims in his foreword, on \"hundreds\" of interviews conducted before- hand with \"foremen, fitters, engineers, designers, manag- Sales drive: BMW 2000 CS Coupe, New York, 1965 ers, secretaries, dealers and shareholders\". What M6nnich does pro- vide is a remorselessly detailed chronicle of the rise, temporary falls, wartime and other fortunes of one of Ger- many's proudest companies since its formal listing as the Bavarian Motor Works in Munich in 1917. Sociologists could well find in it as much, if not more, of interest as anyone seeking lessons and pointers for contemporary industry, for the author is punctilious in putting BMW's activities in their social, political, economic and even his own philosophi- cal context. And his treat- ment of those activities is encyclopaedic: from motor sport to a blow-by-blow account of the crisis days at the end of the 1950s when BMW came so close to extinction. There can be few fears about inaccuracies. Monnich describes his role as \"more that of detective than author\". By comparison, Holmes himself is a dilet- tante. John Griffiths",

   "text_content" : "I The white heat of an Industrial revolution SOMEONE was going to have to put an oxygen lance into that naked bath. Thomp- son swung around on his feet and cried, \"Lance it!\" The bathtub was within thirty sec- o,.ds of overflow. Big Dave Thompson looked around No one moved. No one knew who was supposed to lance the bath. Thompson grabbed an oxygen harpoon. He cracked the lance valve and oxygen hissed from the tip of the lance. Thompson jumped on to the bathtub. He drove the lance into the hot metal fish- ing the jet through liquid steel, feeling for the drain opening of the bathtub. He felt the lance strike the stop- per. Keeping the tip of the lance against the stopper, he guided the tip down into the drain hole. There was a thud in the bathtub. A terrifying spray of sparks 'billowed into the air and Thompson van- ished in the spray. ANYONE WHO thinks the steel industry is boring should read Richard Preston's gripping account of how Nucor, a leading US mini-mill group, built its Compact Strip Pro- duction (CSP) facility in the cornfields near Crawfords- ville, Indiana. It is a drama of people and technology, of entrepreneur- ial ambition and physical courage. A young company with a young staff, many of whom have never seen hot metal before, is installing an untried process for casting steel into thin, flat strip. If it works, Nucor will be making sheet steel at a cost far below that of \"Big Steel\", the long-established integrated producers. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, is trying to do for the steel mill what Apple had done for the com- puter - \"to cram a steel mill into a box\". The process was invented by Schloemann-Siemag in Germany. The Germans, writes Preston, were uneasy. at first about the Nucor style. They \"did not like the idea of Indiana farmers pour- ing hot metal into their cast- ing machine. . .These Americans were clever with their hands but they were irresponsible. They were like children. They liked to play with fire and they had to be watched\". Preston's prose is some- times purple, but be admira- bly conveys the technical complexities of the pro the nervous cmaraderi the casting deck (\"people's mouths were open, they were either screaming In fright or cherasing or both\"), Â·.:._(Â·rT Â·_owji Â· yinlw , 3 ).w \\ AMERICAN STEEL by Richard Preston Prentice Hall Press $19.95, 278 pages CHANGING PATTERNS OF INTERNATIONAL RIVALRY edited by Etsuo Abe and Yoshitaka Suzuki Univ. of Tokyo Press Â£50, 315 pages out!\" as molten steel gets loose in the machine. The brash Nucor men think little of the bureau- crats of Big Steel - their business schools, their hunt- ing lodges, their soundproof meeting rooms. \"The one thing they never understood was how to invest money shrewdly in manufacturing technology, and their task of managing a giant steel company was not made easier by the fact that they never much cared for the men on the bottom who made the steel. They were never able to inspire the hot metal men to do much of anything except to go out on strike.\" Yet is management failure an adequate explanation of the decline of Big Steel after 1960? Paul Tiffany, in his contribution to Changing patterns of international rivalry - subtitled \"Some lessons from the steel indus- try\", a set of papers given at a business history confer- ence in Japan - argues that industry leaders \"failed to find common ground with traditional adversaries, in both organised labour and the government, over a strat- egy for long-term success.\" e blames the govern- ment for clumsy attempts at price control - highlighted in the clash between President Kennedy and Roger Blough of US Steel in 1962 - and for its indiscriminate use of for- eign aid to subsidise new steel industries around the world. As for the American lag in switching from open hearth to basic oxygen fur- naces, in the early 9ISis, the new process was then untried in large operations and the companies were under strong pressure from the government to expand capacity quickly to meet the needs of the Korean war. Other contributors suggest that the olgopolistic struc- ture of the nladustry, domli- nated by an tPerMient Iprie WPM\", k MOM,:.~;Q#~~e~ agea mnovaton. woum per- formance have been better if US Steel had been broken up? (The question might be asked about the car industry and General Motors.) Interestingly, the even more dominant Japan Steel was split in 1950, on Ameri- can orders, into two separate integrated companies, Yawata Steel and Fuji Steel. This change, according to Seiichiro Yonekura, prompted an entrepreneurial response from Kawasaki Steel, at that time a non-inte- grated producer that had relied on Japan Steel for sup- plies of semi-finished steel. It decided, against the wishes of MITI, to invest in a state-of-the-art integrated works on a coastal site at Chiba. This initiated a wave of investments in large coastal works, incorporating the latest technology, and paved the way for Japan's dominance in world steel. It was remarkably similar to the heyday of the American steel industry between 1890 and 1930 when innovative companies such as Armco, Inland and National expan- ded rapidly. competitive business environment, market growth, technologi- cal opportunity, a supportive or at least not actively hos- tile government - these are the ingredients which seem to foster an efficient steel industry. Yet it must be said that the absence of strong domestic competition has not prevented POSCO of South Korea from becoming one of the world's most effi- cient producers. No doubt, as Sung-il Juhn argues in his paper, T.J. Park, the founder of POSCO, was an outstand- ing entrepreneur, but \"national champion\" status has evidently not damaged the company's performance. As the American mini- mills have shown, a deter- mined maverick can make a success even of an unpromis- ing environment. How big and lasting the maverick's impact will be is another question. Will Nucor be another People Express, the entrepreneurial airline that lost its way as it became big- ger? Preston reports talk in Nucor of leapfrogging Japan and of America becoming the world's low-cost pro- ducer. Now that really would be, as the Crawfordsville manager put it, \"the biggest turnaround since Henry Houdini escaped from a cos- fin at the bottom of a froaen river\".",

Its difficult birth from the amalgamation of 18 differ- ent, often disparate unions was seen at the time as a triumph for its first general secretary, Ernest Bevin. His- torians concurred with con- temporary judgment. This July, the T&G's 34th BDC (Biennial Delegate Con- ference) at Blackpool was Ron Todd's last conference as general secretary. He received a warm display of affection from delegates and a fulsome eulogy from Bill Morris, the general secre- tary-elect. Todd and Morris come from the union's left wing, which has dominated its leadership since Frank Cous- ins gained the top office after the previous incum- bent's sudden death. The T&G left wing shared other socialists' negative view of Bevin. He was anti-commu- nist, arrogant, undemocratic, THE HISTORY OF THE TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS' UNION VOLUMES I: PARTS I and II by Ken Coates and Tony Topham Basil Blackwell, Â£95 (Â£20 to TGWU members), 909 pages and had done little to merit their respect. It was there- fore remarkable and moving to hear Bill Morris accord Ron Todd a place in the roll of venerable T&G general secretaries beginning with Ernest Bevin, and continu- ing through Frank Cousins, Jack Jones, and Moss Evans. Morris expeditiously altered the actual line of succession by omitting the two general secretaries who were Bevin's immediate successors and keen Cold War crusaders! Morris's revisionism is timely. The T&G may have weathered the coincidence of statutory attack and Britain's manufacturing atrophy, but Bill Morris faces an enormous task in guiding Britain's largest union back to its pre-emi- nent position in \"the move- ment\". The FT has regularly reported the political in- fighting within the union's executive; there are continu- ing financial difficulties. The union and its members need the self-confidence and con- viction of both the justice and importance of their cause which is Bevin's legacy. were given the first instalment of the T&G's official history. It is handsomely produced in a boxed set and covers the eventful period from the London Dock Strike in 1889 to the T&G's birth in the aftermath of the First World War. The punctilious may cavil that this is actually the union's pre-history. Ken Coates and Tony Topham provide ample justification for its inclusion. They record the declarations of the new union's founders who self- consciously fashioned tradi- tion to include their particu- lar litanies of battles and heroes. Coates and Topham examine the source of these activists' inspiration: the memorable upheavals of the early 1890s and the period from 1911 to the outbreak of war. Readers should not be deterred by the first vol- ume's length. The history is a very good read. The peo- ple, the strikes, and the debates about strategy and tactics spring vividly to life from its pages. One of the people who emerges unex- pectedly from the mists of the past is Robert Williams. Williams is- generally neglected because of his place in labour movement demonology for his alleged betrayal during Black Friday in 1921. Coates and Topham ernest nvin: assoivsu o0 charges of 111ltreatment of union leaders argue that his sentence is wholly unmerited, and report his capable and ener- getic leadership of the Trans- port Workers' Federation during the war. Though the authors have clearly written for a non-aca- demic audience, they do not fail to address the main aca- demic disputes surrounding the union's history. They record their own viewpoint, but always provide sufficient evidence of the other side to enable readers to make up their own minds. Coates and Topham take a thorough-going revisionist view of Ernest Bevin. While they make no attempt to conceal their own strong commit- ment to workers' control and industrial democracy, they chronicle fully the circum- stances which led Bevin to become a centraliser. They also quote extensively from his early speeches and writ- ings to show how in many ways his own views on the world coincide with their own principles. They absolve Bevin from the notorious and familiar charges of ill-treatment of other union leaders, notably Ben Tillett. They acknowl- edge the \"negative\" qualities of the man - the unusual force, bluntness, and over- weening arrogance. But they do not accept the left's usual verdict that these qualities were prima facie evidence of Bevin's \"dictatorship\". British trade unions have been no less affected by national characteristics than British business or British politics. Even when there have been marked upheavals and con- flicts, and notable peaks and troughs in their develop- ment, they have usually invented a continuous tradi- tion to prove their legiti- macy. Coates and Topham have shown that the T&G is no exception to this strong desire for an authenticated past. Nevertheless, readers will also find the evidence which gives authenticity to this presumption of continu- ity. Certainly, the spirit and culture which the force of Bevin's character infused into the institution he founded were still very much in evidence at the union's BDC in July 1991. Instead of the barely con- cealed holiday atmosphere which accompanies British conventions held by the sea, the delegates were disci- plined and serious-minded. They came to the rostrum to proclaim to the all the world (whom they assumed to be listening) the dilemmas and injustices faced in their workplaces. Bevin moulded the T&G in the belief that his union would make history. The del- egates in Blackpool still behaved as if they were peo- ple of destiny. Reading the official history can only rein- force their sense of having been called to serve \"their\" and Bevin's people.",

   "text_content" : "HT i wiiiam Morris industry has been in flood in recent years: craftsman, designer, artist, poet, socialist, utopian, romancer - his life has been fully and respectfully described in a succession of volumes, often with the bonus of splendid illustra- tions. That is fair enough, and no one these days will deny him his fame and his distinction. This latest book most excellently fills a gap. It is the story of Morris as busi- nessman, and the gap exists because none of his admir- ing biographers has previ- ously been particularly interested in the fact that for 35 years he was a suc- cessful, hard-working \"small businessman\" (in today's phrase), a vigorous Victo- rian entrepreneur. The authors of William Morris: Design and Enter- prise in Victorian Britain describe his business career as \"one of the most singular and colourful of the nine- teenth century\", which may be slightly over the top, but certainly they are right to show that his success as a businessman \"made him an influential figure of national WILLIAM MORRIS: DESIGN AND ENTERPRISE IN VICTORIAN BRITAIN by Charles Harvey and Jon Press Manchester Univ.Press Â£451 Â£12.95, 257 pages importance, and indeed was crucial to his success in other fields.\" Those other fields included the passionate and sustained advocacy of a socialist revolution. We are not talking here in terms of Sir Terence Conran or Anita Roddick standing up on a Labour or Green platform. Morris came to believe that art, which was vital to life, could only flourish in a soci- ety liberated from the destructive forces of com- mercial warfare in \"our hateful modern society\", and he spent much energy and money in his middle years in pursuing the cause of revolution rather than radical reform. W as he therefore a hypocrite in pro- claiming revolu- tion while making (as these biographers put it) \"no attempt to run the firm in accordance with socialist priadples\"? They do not try to evade the quiesti: they acknowl- edge that, Ina the midst of his soulalism, Morris was deing the Interior decoration for St James's Palace. They note that in his later a he ISa the emscon to prodace editions which ldy the rich cosid hopto buy - \"His was a serios purpose and that purpese demied that he say bme.

Of course, the self-pro- claimed disciple of Ruskin, whose firm's products by definition adorned only the homes of the rich and whose employees were hired and governed according to the conventional terms of the time, was criticised in his own lifetime for hypocrisy. This \"business biogra- phy\", which could hardly have been done better save for an element of repetition, reminds us of Raskin's demand that we recognise the true social purpose of \"Idividual goalor profit, should never be a goal in itself .. rollt Is [sad Rus- kn) not hie obeldt of life to a true merchant .. .it is 'to understand the very root eUtie of the thing he deas n, and the meas of obtaINte It aIn pOld a it; ad be has to so ya his in rol to \"\"udud it the -epftt pissibl prie where meat Meeed.\"' r, ha veo him elb s ely JD F JOes",

   "text_content" : "HEN IT happens, Virtual Reality (VR) will change how we live, work and com- municate. I felt like Keats reading Homer when I had finished Howard Rheingold's wonderful book, Virtual Reality: \"Much have I trav- elled in the realms of gold, and many goodly states and kingdoms seen.\" Anyone interested in the next 20 years must read this. VR is a computer-based technology which gives the illusion of immersion in an artificial world, or of pres- ence in a remote location in the physical world. For state of the art VR, one must be able to move around in the computer-generated environ- ment and interact with it. There are three essential pieces of kit: first, a stereo- graphic helmet that contains two miniature television tubes sending images to each eye; second, a \"datag- love\" that allows the com- puter to plot the position and interpret the commands of the hand so it can reach out and grasp a virtual object in the virtual world- and third, a set of computers calculating the space coordi- nates for each particle of the virtual world, at 32m or so instructions per second. If mathematics is queen of the sciences computer graphics is the riyal interpreter. The essence of VR is to present data in a form com- patible with our own systems of perception. Read- ing or typing, for example, are not inherently natural activities. But watching movement or colour, feeling hot or cold, are. VR is a com- puter world operated not by keyboard, but by gesture, voice, walking and looking. Any three-dimensional problem can be tackled by VIRTUAL REALITY by Howard Rheingold Secker Warburg Â£16.99, 415 pages TECHNOLOGY 2001: THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION edited by Derek Leebaert MIT Press Â£26.95, 392 pages VR. The applications prom- ise much for architecture, firefighting, surgery, scien- tific modelling, education and communication - the industrial and entertainment applications are mindbend- ing. Imagine a surgeon recreat- ing his patient in three-dimensional VR before focusing real radiation beams on the real tumour. In October 1990 The New York Times mentioned Citicorp funding attempts to display financial data in 3D. VR technology hitched not to a human but to a robot allows remote operations - telerobotics - in hazardous locations. There is even the threat of VR-pornography. Rheingold, a technology journalist, gallops through the origins,, development, applications and future of VR on a journey ftom the caves at Lascaux to the Uni- versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Kansai Science City outside Kyoto. VR has proved to be the interdisciplinary venture. It began in the late 1960s with Ivan Sutherland at the Uni- versity of Utah who saw the computer display as a looking-glass to a mathemat- ical wonderland, believing that it should inform one's sense of touch, sound and sight. Advances in computing, stereoscopy and simulation have brought VR to a usable state in academic, military and commercial research. A basic and crude kit costs around $15,000 (Â£8,875) to $20,000, plus the computer. Next century, as text by the Library-of-Congress-load sings down the fibreoptic cables, it will takesomething more amenable than a PC and modem to cope. VR is an enabling tool; it is still pretty crude - there is a time-lag as the computer cal- culates each new position as the visitor moves through the virtual world. But Rhein- gold has no doubt: \"When today's infant VR technology matures in a few years, it promises (and threatens) to change what it means to be human.\" After Virtual Reality, the collection of essays in Tech- nology 2001 covers more familiar territory, and is much more specific about every day hardware. There are fine, simple essays on supercomputing, optical storage, and imaging capa- bilities. Science Fiction is never far from new technology, either in the form of William Gibson (his 1984 Neuroman- car is essential VR reading) or Arthur C. Clarke, whose preface to Technology 2001 finds no reason for any \"fun- damental difference between a device constructed of sili- con and one of carbon.\" In general, however, the collec- tion preserves the machine- human divide by raising moral and pre-legal ques- tions of access and privacy in the communications world we are building.

   "text_content" : "INTERNATIONAL Busi- ness Machines (IBM) is the company which introduced machine compati- bility to the computer indus- try in the 1960s, threw away over the next two decades much of the ground it gained, and is condemned to spend the early 1990s repeat- ing its earlier history. This book explains why. Those who see IBM as an all-pervasive force may be surprised to find that the giant of the computer indus- try has feet, if not of clay, then of some material less hard than granite. It has so dominated its competition over the past half century that only with the emer- gence in the 1980s of two industry trends, downsizing and networking, were the extent of the anomalies in its product ranges revealed. Companies downsize when they replace large expensive computers with smaller, cheaper systems.

And this In spite of a flying start in the U0o o the intro- IBM's 360 AND EARLY 370 SYSTEMS by Emerson W Pugh The MIT Press Â£33.75, 819 pages duction of the industry's first single family of compat- ible computers - Sys- tem/30. Computer programs written for any processor in the System/360 line could be run on any other processor with equal or greater mem- ory capacity. Introduced in 1964, the effect of System/M60 on the industry was shattering - over 1,100 orders for the were received in the first month. Today, some 25 per cent of the value of all com- paters of all sies made by all manufacturers conform to the System/3NO design. To accommodate custom- era with smaller data pro- cessing loads, less expensive computer designs were intro- duoed which were incompat- ible with System/bal. The book also tells the story of the abmandoment in 195 of \"uture Series\", the computer fualy that was to replac h ystenta . Tecani- ally innovative, it Intro- duced computing concepts that were not to become pop- ular for another 20 years. It became too technically challenging and it was aban- doned at great cost. System/ 360 instead evolved into Sys- tem/370. Now IBM is again trying to ensure compatibility across its product lines through Systems Applica- tions Architecture (SAA), a set of rules and protocols defining how IBM's systems should behave. SAA is out- side the scope of the present volume, but Emerson Pugh and his co-authors provide a clear insight into the argu- ments over machine compat- ibility as well as a host of intriguing details about the development of disk drives, semiconductor memories and the like. IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems is clearly written but will nevertheless appeal chiefly to the technically competent. A pity, because the stories it tells are com- plementary to more ortho- dox business histories of IBM and an invaluable aid to understanding the develop ment of the world's most important computer manu- faltuCer.

   "text_content" : "F THE business owner or would-be entrepreneur read only a fraction of the \"small business\" books published each year he would have little time left to run his company. The diffi- culties encountered by the small firms sector in the recession do not appear to have persuaded the publish- ers to cut back. Indeed, since most small business books set out to solve problems, the recession may have stim- ulated the publishers. An irritating characteris- tic of some of the authors in this field is their tendency to write down to their audi- ence, to present wild gener- alisations or glib assump- tions as business expertise. T.K. Hayes' The Money-Mak- ing Guide To Choosing A Retail Business (The Small Business Information Ser- vice. Â£29.95. 178 pages), for example, suggests - opti- mistically and certainly wrongly - in its section on greengrocers \"Once you have set up your first shop, it is easy to expand to own- ing two, three or four shops.\" Curiously, it nowhere discusses the prob- lems related to renting or buying a shop. Even Gary Jones, in Starting Up (NatWest Busi- ness Handbooks. Â£8.99. 248 pages), an otherwise excel- lent guide to getting started, is not immune to oversimpli- fications. The NatWest series is just one to be launched by the banks in recent years. Their entry into the small business publishing field has done a great deal of good in a previ- ously rather self-indulgent sector. Among the most recent of the NatWest titles are Book- keeping and Accounting, now in its second edition, by Geoffrey Whitehead, which provides a very readable guide to dry but essential topics such as VAT, accounts and double entry systems. Marketing Decisions, another Gary Jones book in the NatWest series, is a down-to-earth and informa- tive guide to a subject which too often attracts jargon and hyperbole. The Barclays series of small business books treats many of the same issues. The Barclays Guide to Mar- keting, by Len Rogers, pro- vides a comprehensive expla- nation of subjects such as market research, product choice and pricing with an extensive list of useful con- tacts and a glossary of mar- keting terms. The breadth of coverage of titles in both of the banking series, as well as of the sin- gle-volume Lloyds Bank Small Business Guide (Pen- guin. 426 pages. Â£12.99) by Sara Williams, makes for good value for money. Other publishers have opted for more specialist guides. It is sometimes questionable though whether this justifies buying another book. Do Your Own Advertising (Hutchinson Business Press. 192 pages Â£7.99) by Alastair Crompton combines fluency of style with examples and detailed practical hints. Finance For Your Busi- ness (Waterlow Publishers. 284 pages Â£16.95) provides an exhaustive though dry cata- logue of methods of financ- ing business. The book ranges widely over venture capital, factoring, export finance and leasing and, since author Peter Walker is a barrister, an explanation of the legal issues.",

Well, take this: \"Her husky voice tingled his eardrums and sent a mes- sage flushing through his body to his genitals.\" \"I recommend we increase the bid to an equivalent of 300 pence per share by offer- ing another 10 pence in cash and 10 pence in unsecured loan stock, with an option to take it all in loan stock for those wishing to do so for Capital Gains Tax purposes.\" \"She struggled her hand to his chest, ripped off the but- tons of his shirt and tore it off him.\" \"We need a holding position that does not preju- dice any of our prospects.\" \"She laid her head back, crooked her left knee against the back of the sofa and dropped her right leg over the edge.\" Sorry, reader, my mistake: it's just that when three of the latest (and the hottest) sex-and-scrip issue thrillers land on your doorstep with PINSTRIPED PREDATORS by Roger Kryss Book Guild Â£14.99, 293 pages PYON by Peter Burdon New English Library, Â£15.99. 323 pages WINNING by Ritchie Smith Headline Â£14.95. 311 pages the literary editor's compli- ments, it's hard to review all three simultaneously with- out your mind beginning to spin and your quotations getting a little jumbled. Now, where were we? That's right, just climbing into bed together: \"What I have in mind is a total com- ing together of our two com- panies, Richard, to create a single powerful unit.\" No, wrong plot. Here we are: \"It was a night of nights. It could have been a month, or a second. It was for both of them the most supreme of conjugation.\" That was one helluva joint venture: \"After two vigorous, speechless hours, they both lay back exhausted, certain that it was the best either of them had ever known.\" All right, I hear what you say, we do seem to have reached the post deal ration- alisation rather quickly. But wait a minute, this is more promising: \"I've known Christy Pyon for over thirty years, and acquisitiveness is like a disease for him. He's obsessional and compulsive in his drive. That's why he so often wins. But I've never seen him as he is over Chemco.\" ut what a woman that Chemco proves to be: \"The blood rushed to his head and he knew he would have to love her, now, savagely, till he had pene- trated the Japan that was her and she had drained him of all his tension.\" Sorry, I'm confused again. Which is which, Chemco the accom- modating Japanese PA with the \"small, pert breasts\", or Sujiki, the multi-national, multi-billion chemicals com- pany? If ever three books could persuade me that the Take-Over Code resembles nothing less than a corporate Kama-Sutra, then these three airport thrillers managed it (Pinstriped Predators, written by a former corporate lawyer, is by far the cleverest). Here's everything they never tell you in the Investor's Chronicle: how shareholders come to be screwed (in every sense); how you notice an illegal support operation; and what happens when business standards deteriorate in the most surprising ways. All of this brought to you exclusively by Rentaplot, with special help from Brandname. Mark Archer",

THE ECONOMIST NUMBERS GUIDE edited by Penny Butler Business Books/Economist Books Â£14.99, 237 pages If you answer yes to most of these questions, you will probably gain something from this book. You will find in this slim volume ways to work out averages, regressions, risks, capital employed, \"z\" scores, two-tail tests and minimum spans. You can also find such matters as the inner meaning of relevance trees, the \"t\" ratio and quartile deviations. There are some surprises. A saddle point is nothing to do with sore horse riders but is a term borrowed from analysis of pricing policy. You would not -buy a runs test from the chemist's shop; it is a way of working out statistical randomness. Numerous other technical terms are described in lots of detail and the book is generally written extremely lightly to aid understanding. There are particularly good sections on seasonal adjustment and investment analysis. However, you are advised not to read it in one sitting, as all these numbers are bad for the brain. Peter Marsh",

   "text_content" : "AR TOO MUCH sinan- cial journalism con- sists either of named- ropping about the corporate elite - as Lord Hanson said to me at the Savoy Grill - or the mind-numbing accu- mulation of technical detail. Michael Lewis, author of Liar's Poker, is that rare beast: an author who can write about matters of finance with wit and clarity. So one can forgive his chutz- pah in issuing a collection of journalism at the age of 30, even if inevitably the vol- ume, at under 200 pages, is rather slim and contains one or two obvious pieces of filler. There is still plenty to enjoy, including much which the UK reader will not have seen before. The pleasure often lies in the incidental details with which Lewis illustrates the follies of the 1980s. I partic- ularly relished the tale of the Australian mogul who threw an Argentine theme party for some Buenos Aires polo players. Unfortunately, inaccurate cultural research caused him to serve his bas- fled guests enchiladas, tacos and guacamole. As a former Salomon bond salesman, Lewis's focus is inevitably on the financial, rather than industrial, trends of the 1980s. How- ever, given that the 1980s was a decade when the pro- cess of making money was seen as far more glamorous than making anything prac- tical, such as cars or com- bine harvesters, that is not too much of a handicap. Lewis, who has made plenty of money both from working for Salomon and from running the firm down, is generally success- ful at combining the air of amused outsider and knowl- edgeable insider. Once or THE MONEY CULTURE by Michael Lewis Hodder & Stoughlon Â£14.99, 188 pages twice, however, the desire to be provocative seems to overcome his intellectual consistency. For example, he is scathing about manage- ment buyouts - the title of his piece on the subject is \"Leveraged rip-off\" - but he leaps to the defence of Michael Milken, the jailed junk bond king. For me, three pieces stood out from the rest of the book. One was a funny, and devastatingly logical, demolition of the rationale for owning an American Express card. The second was a frightening study of a little-discussed topic - the effect that a Tokyo earthquake might have on the world economy. The third was a surreal account of an American investment seminar, combined with a boat cruise up the Amazon. But I suspect most people will buy the book to hear more tales about rich and greedy bankers, and how they came to grief. Such as the fired Chemical banker, described by Lewis, who was told by the personnel department on his way out of the door that the company Porsche should be returned soon. The next morning he drove the Porsche on to the pavement in front of the bank and parked it flush against the front door. He then turned on the car alarm, locked the door, and threw the key into the Thames. Philip Coggan",
