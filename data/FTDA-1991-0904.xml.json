   "text_content" : "vy John Lloyd in Moscow MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, yesterday with- drew Monday's proposals to grant the republics political supremacy and instead sought support for a new plan to retain some Union structure. Mr Gorbachev, who finally took the podium at the second session of the Congress of Peo- ple's Deputies, withdrew a con- troversial proposal to set up a transitional parliament of republics. He called on depu- ties to save the Union from oblivion. The new proposals would retain a Supreme Soviet, but with one chamber nominated by the republican parliaments and one directly elected. He said the leaders of the 10 republics, who on Monday had jointly proposed the transi- tional Council of Representa- tives with him, had agreed to drop this element. He won the backing of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, who said he was sure that 14 of the 15 republics would sign the earlier-proposed economic agreement. In a sop to deputies who were angered that the earlier plans would have given repub- lics full control of federal bod- ies, Mr Gorbachev said the Supreme Soviet could continue to exist as a lawmaking body for the transitional period until a new constitution was signed. The latest formula, rushed out by the Soviet president and the 10 republican leaders who are now co-operating to push through new federal struc- tures, would retain some ele- ment of all-union representa- tion - and implies immediate elections to the new body. It leaves unclear, however, which republics would partici- pate in such elections, and the deputies: \"I trust Mikhail Gorbachev more now than three weeks ago\" THE SOVIET UNION SSwift reversal saves ti Union from oblivion; US may end Soviet space deal ban, Page 2 U Edward Mortimer: A fair deal for minorities, Page 17 announcement gave the impression of a hurried policy change in response to com- plaints of unconstitutionality and lack of sufficient influence for Russia in the council of rep resentatives. Mr Gorbachev, in a speech powerfully delivered, if short on detail, pleaded with the republics - all of which, except Russia, have now announced some form of inde- pendence - to agree to a new Union treaty in which they could be federative, confedera- tive or associate members. \"Let this Union be really voluntary so that it meets differing inter- ests\", he said. Mr Yeltsin sought in a short speech during the morning ses- sion to calm fears that Russia would use its stock of moral capital and economic power to dominate any Union. As he was speaking, Mr Yuri Shcherbak, the Ukrainian envi- ronment minister, told report- ers that he still feared the renewed imperialism that Mr Yeltsin disavowed. Mr Yeltsin squarely blamed Mr Gorbachev for laying the conditions for the coup by pro- moting and encouraging hard- liners in his government. How- ever, he said: \"I personally trust Mikhail Sergeycrich Gor- bachev more now than, for example, three weeks ago.\" The Russian leader later said that the other republics in which nuclear weapons were sited - Ukraine and Kazakh- stan - were working on an accord to return them to Rus- sia, where most are now based. He said: \"We need to continue our work to eliminate all nuclear weapons,\" echoing an earlier position taken by the Soviet president. Disagreement over economic reform emerged at a press con- ference attended by the four members of the Committee of Management of the National Economy.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor, in Beijing AN UNCOMPROMISING attack on China's human rights record by Mr John Major yesterday overshadowed new Sino-British commitments to ensure the smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. During the second day of his talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing, Mr Major told Li Peng, the Chinese premier, that Britain intended to maintain \"unrelenting and unremitting\" pressure to win the release of political dissidents and other detainees. Li responded with an equally firm defence of China's politi- cal and cultural system, argu- ing that the most basic human right in a country of l.lbn peo- ple was to have sufficient food. He reminded his guest of Britain's inglorious record on human rights during its inter- vention in China last century. Speaking in uncharacteristi- cally sharp terms at a later press conference, Mr Major said his visit to Beijing was not a signal that the world had for- gotten the crushing of the Chi- nese pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 and the subsequent clamp- HK airport deal seen as basis for co-operanon ..........Page 4 Ctic arm set to control Han chong Investment.......Page 25 down on basic freedoms. \"There is worldwide concern about human rights...I made the worldwide concern per- fectly clear in my remarks today. They were free, frank and forthright exchanges,\" he said. Referring to what he termed a series of \"hard-phrased and specific\" criticisms covering religious repression in Tibet as well as political detentions, Mr Major said that he had pres- ented Li with a list of individ- ual cases. They included two members of the pro-democracy move- ment currently on hunger strike in jail, prisoners of con- science identified by Amnesty International and four Hong Kong residents in detention in China. \"Our discussion today on human rights is not the end of the matter,\" he said. He prom- ised to take a \"personal inter- est\" in future talks on the issue between Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart. At a press briefing Wu Jian- min, China's official spokes- man, omitted to mention the lengthy discussion on human rights between the two pre- miers until asked by a ques- tioner. Mr Major, who earlier in the day had been intensely irri- tated when Chinese security police prevented him from mix- ing with local residents during a tour of the city, pointedly Continued on Page 18 Major Continued from Page 1 declined to issue a reciprocal invitation for Li to visit Britain. lQan, however, will meet Mr nurd in London next spring.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent THE chief executive of Brel, Britain's biggest railway train manufacturer, has lost his job because of the company's fail- ure to deliver trains to British Rail on time. Mr Peter Holdstock, 60, who led the management-employee buy-out of Brel from BR in April 1989, has been replaced by Mr Bo Sodersten, a 53-year- old Swede with long experience in the railway equipment industry. Brel has plunged into losses because of its continuing inability to meet production schedules on new trains for BR. The most serious delays have been with a new express train called the Class 158 which was supposed to have led to a leap in quality of ser- vices on Regional Railways and Scotrail routes from Sep- tember 1989. Instead, timetables were thrown into chaos when pro- duction difficulties led to a year-long delay in delivery. Teething troubles with te new trains have caused further seri ous problems since they started entering service. Brel has also fallen badly behind schedule on the produc- a tion of a new class of subrban i trains called the Class 165, des- tined for Network SouthEast's Chiltern routes out of London's Marylebone station. Mr Ian Forrester, Brel's director of personnel and busi- ness services, said the delays a in deliveries meant sales income was failing to match the company's heavy outgoings on labour and materials for the I new trains. He would not speculate on i the scale of the expected es I this year, but acknowledged I that they would mark a signii- cant reversal hfom the pre-tax prots ofr 22.4m in the year to I September 1990.

Each of these owns 40 per cent of BrD, with the remaining 20 per cent owned by the management and employee.

   "text_content" : "By Michael Smith, Lisa Wood and Alison Smith MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour party leader, yesterday greeted with relief a decisive trade union vote to reject left- wing demands to scrap all the \"anti-union legislation\" intro- duced by the Conservatives since 1979. The Trades Union Congress, meeting in Glasgow, gave overwhelming support to a rival motion backing Labour's policy of a more limited reform of employment laws. Mr Kinnock, in Glasgow for a dinner with the TUC general council, said the votes would improve Labour's electoral chances. More important, he said, they signified an \"atti- tude towards constructive industrial relations which is reciprocated by mangers around Britain\". However, Mr Michael Howard, the employment sec- retary, described the debate as a sham and added that every section of the labour move- ment wanted a massive shift in power in favour of unions. The debate on employment was the most controversial of the TUC congress week. Dele- gates voted 5.8m to 2.2m against the motion, calling for repeal of all anti-union legisla- tion, proposed by Mr Arthur Scargill, National Union of Mineworkers' president. Mr Norman Willis, TUC gen- eral secretary, said the NUM motion would give comfort to \"our opponents\" and could be interpreted to mean the aboli- tion of legal requirements for strike ballots and ballots for executive elections. \"The public certainly won't accept that and poll after poll has told us that our members won't accept that either.\" In its employment law reform plans, Labour has said it will keep legal requirements for ballots on industrial action and for elections of senior trade union leaders. However, it would restore the right to take sympathy action \"where there is a direct interest between two groups of work- ers of an occupational or pro- sessional nature\". Mr Scargill said the TUC should not abandon its princi- ples on the false premise that it would be wrong to rock the boat and undermine a Labour Continued on Page 18 Congress reports, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 16 Kinnock Continued from Page 1 victory. It was far better to be open and honest \"and say all laws should be repealed\". He said he was not against bal- lots, but unions should be free from state interference in the operation of them. However, Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the National Communications Union, criticised unions which failed to give their full support to Labour policy. \"They detest this government. Yet, unwit- tingly may keep it in power by their insistence on continuing the argument over whether we should accept any legal regula- tion of union affairs,\" he said. The motion carried by the TUC urged the repeal of anti- trade union legislation, but also called for the right of union members to elect princi- pal officers and a right to a strike ballot. Mr Howard said there was no practical difference between the two rival motions. Labour would give unions privileges denied them even by Mr Michael Foot in the 1970s. These included the right to force employers to recognise them and absolute protection against dismissal for strikers. racmng aereat: Arur Au cargin aunng me vow on nsU mouon cmagl zor me repeal e an ana-union legaUIaon",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop- ment (EBRD) yesterday adopted a plan of action for its operations in the Soviet Union this year that will focus on the provision of technical exper- tise. A meeting of the EBRD board, which was attended by a delegation from the Soviet Union and the Russian Federa- tion headed by Mr Ernest Obminsky, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, decided to concentrate technical assis- tance in the areas of privatisa- tion, the financial sector, agri- cultural distribution systems and energy. The bank, which was set up earlier this year to help the emerging democracies of east- ern Europe develop market- based economies, also announced that it will take immediate steps to establish an office in Moscow. A statement issued after the meeting made no reference to recent suggestions for an increase in the bank's limited ability to lend to the Soviet Union. It is understood this issue did not figure on yesterday's agenda. Although the European Community favours increasing the EBRD's lending capacity, the US, Japan and some other members of the bank are opposed. The bank's action plan stresses the importance of training Soviet managers in how to privatise companies and how to develop a financial services industry. The bank is also providing advice on privatisation to the governments of the republics and municipalities. An EBRD spokeswoman said the bank would welcome indi- vidual applications for mem- bership from the newly inde- pendent Baltic states as soon as they were fully recognised by all of the governments rep- resented on the EBRD's board. A team of EBRD officials is currently visiting the Baltic states,of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, she said. * Two US congressmen said they would introduce a bill to give Most-Favoured Nation aht*ato the th. e Blti states, Rinter reprts from Washington."

Mr Madigan, who is to lead a high-powered US delegation to the Soviet Union this month, warned that food-rich republics might argue over the distribu tion of food with poorer neigh bours. During a news conference irn Washington, Mr Madigan said that it would be difficult to supply individual republics with export credit guarantees to buy US farm produce because the US had no idea of their creditworthiness. A team of experts led by Mr Richard Crowder, under- secretary of agriculture, will leave as early as the end of this week to conduct a preliminary survey of areas likely to see food surpluses and shortages this winter. The findings of the two teams will be presented to President George Bush, who will share the information with the Group of Seven industria- lised countries and other nations willing to take part in a coordinated effort to supply food aid this winter. * Mr Theo Waigel, the Ger- man finance minister, yester- day warned strongly against fragmentation of the Soviet Union and called for guaran- tees that existing Soviet debts be met, Quentin Peel writes from Bon.",

Two weeks later, however, Mr Shamlev and other senior oficlals remain at their posts and Mr Shamlev's supporter have even formed a defence committee to protect his power and rputation. The only sign that the coup found support in Kazan is a mall hand-written sign declaring \"lory to the GKChP\" (the unpronounceable acronym of the coup commit- tee) which still graces the wall of a small river bridge carrying Tatarstan Avenue towards the city centre. Last Friday, the Tatar Supreme Soviet, the local par- liament, in which communists hold 218 of 250 seats, endorsed the stand taken by Mr Shamiev as consonant with the defence of the national interests of the republic, which forms part of the Russian Federation. Parliament declined to set up a special commission to Inves- tigate the coup. Its aly con- cession was reluctantly to endone President Ukba Go- bechev's order to susped the activities of the Coimmunst party, and place a guard on its property. In vain, Mr Maioult haI- zov, and other radical deputies from the 30-strong People's Power faction, called for the resignation of Mr Shamiev and the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Mr Farid Mukhamet- shin, before walking out in pro- test. \"Unfortunately, the coup did not last long enough for its hidden supporters to reveal themselves,\" Mr Khaflom com- mented bitterly. The reason why many sus- pected coup supporters kept their heads down during tbse crucial three days was Inadver- tently revealed by Mr Nail Samiulin, the first deputy minister of the Interior. He, Ike other senior aicials, was still on holiday when the coup b*gn. As on s he retunreI to his ice, his fist prit was to find out from Mon which way the wind was blow- ing. The word from Mocow was that the coup leadrs were incompetent and had little chanee of sucamcss. That genaty Mr Samlullin ignored instruction from the Soviet Interior Ministry, headed by Mr DBais PM eos the mop ers, ana took his odor omy from the RslaM i f the Inaterior, which was ab ordiate to Mr Yeltsin.

Kaan, an independent khanate until absorbed into the Russian empire after its defeat by Tsar Ivan the Terri- ble in 152, remains the north- ernmost outpot of Islam. Tatar nationalism now helps to sustain Mr Shamiev in power. The local parliament's declara- tion of independence on August 30 10 artffly merges the desire of ethnic Tatars to reassert their cultural and reli- glous identity with the desire of the local Coamunist party to retain Its grip on power by playlng the natiooalst card.

   "text_content" : "By John ULloyd in Moscow THE Supreme Soviet, and with it some notion of the Soviet Union, appears to have been saved from oblivion. In his sudden, almost throwaway, announcement to the Congress of Peoples Deputies yesterday, Presi- dent Mikhail Gorbachev has, it seems, revived an institution which would draw its elective mandate from the Union. He has thus contin- ued the constitutional life of the Supreme Soviet, albeit in a new form. He also seems to have ceded to demands that Russia be given power more commensurate with its size. The precise import of. his announcement is, as is now com- monplace, still unclear. But what Mr Gorbachev told the Congress yester- day appears to be this. The Council of Representatives originally proposed to the Congress on Monday - which was to act a a kind of transitional parliament, made up of 20 representatives from each republic, until a constitution -i signed - will not now be formed. Mr Gorbachev said that in discus- sions with the 10 republican leaders who are now co-operating with him in trying to preserve some form of a union, the question of its legislative powers was \"repeatedly raised\". They seem to have decided that it could not, constitutionally, be a leg- islative chamber - although Mr Ser- gei Alexeyev, the Constitutional Compliance Committee chairman, had earlier said it could. ., As a result, the Soviet and republi- can leaders have fallen back on another modelk not the old Supreme Soviet, but -a revamped Supreme Soviet as described in the Union Treaty - which was to have been signed on August 20. -This is conceived of as a two- chamber legislature, with the upper, and superior, chamber being the Council of the Republics. The mem- bers of this council will be delegated by the union republics - and by the autonomous republics, regions and areas that exist within the union republics,cespecially within Russia. The draft treaty says that the dis- tribution of seats in the new upper chamber will be the same as for the Council of Nationalities in the pres- ent Supreme'Soviet - 11 each from union republics, four each from autonomous republics, two each from autonomous regions and one each from autonomous areas. The second chamber is the Coun- cil of the Union, elected on a territo- ilal basis across the' Soviet Union from constituencies of equal popula- tion - which means that Russia has over half the votes. In the draft treaty, the houses are given responsibility for jointly tak- ing many key decisions. The Council of the Republics would take the remaining major ones - such as leg- islating on the shape and function of the federal authorities and supervi- sing inter-republican relations. Laws enacted by the Council of the Union would also have to be ratified by the Council of the Republics. This would mean that Russia would have a majority in one house ,and a substantial minority in the other - through its own votes and those of the autonomous republics, regions and areas on its territory which would, in most cases, vote with it. This answers the complaint made by many Russian deputies that the Council of Representatives, with 20 votes to each republic, took no account of Russia's importance. It also answers the complaints voiced on the floor of the Congress yesterday that the abolition of the present Congress of Peoples Depu- ties and the Supreme Soviet violated the constitution. In addition, the new proposals also address the objections by the auton- omous republics that they had no representation on the Council of Representatives. Adding to the pressure for change was the conclusion of a joint meet- ing of the committees on legislation and constitutional supervision, released last night, which said that the law-making function of the Supreme Soviet should be preserved in the transitional period until a con- stitution is signed."

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE US government is considering relaxing its restric- tions on the launch of US satel- lites by Soviet rockets. This move could open the way for the Soviet space pro- gramme to start marketing its services around the world. Soviet efforts to break into the market for commercial sat- ellite launches has been inhib- ited by the fact that US regula- tions forbid the export of such high technology items to coun- tries like the Soviet Union for reasons of national security. A large proportion of the world's satellites are either owned or made by the US. Washington has refused to allow satellites to be shipped to the Soviet Union, even for the short period necessary for a launch into orbit. The rules have been relaxed in the past, however, to allow US payloads to be lifted into space by the Chinese Long March rocket. The world satellite launch- ing market is dominated by Arianespace, the European consortium, in competition with General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas of the US. Increased Soviet access to the world satellite market is likely to meet stiff opposition. Commercial launchers like Ari- ane complain that the Soviet and Chinese programmes can undercut them because their prices bear no relation to their costs nor to market reality. Soviet space officials have periodically proposed their ser- vices to the US, notably offer- ing their huge Energia rocket as a heavy launch vehicle. They have also sold seats on their space flights to astro- nauts from other countries. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has an agreement to co-operate with the Soviet space agency; the two agencies fly instruments on each other's space vessels and pool data in a number of areas. However, the Soviets have never made any formal commercial offer to Nasa. Efforts to market Soviet space capabilities for hard cur- rency, including the orbiting space station Mir, may inten- sify now that the country's increasing economic difficul- ties are puttng pressure on the space bd. The Soviet space programme has already been scaled back, but Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Rus- sian president, has complained that too much is spent on space exploration at a time when the country's standard of living is too low."

   "text_content" : "ani reas newspapers auring a Dreax m yesterays session or me onugress or reople-s uepaues THE THREE breakaway Baltic republics yesterday took the first step to United Nations membership, as Britain and France presented formal appli- cations to the UN sec- retary-general on their behalf. The US said It would sponsor a resolution to cut the usual waiting period from 35 to seven days The requests by Estonia, Lat- via and Lithuania must still be submitted to the UN Security Council and approved by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. Mr Aleksander V. Denisov, Soviet mission spokesman, said the Soviet Union would not block membership for the Baltics. \"On the contrary, we will support it,\" he added. The request to Mr Javier Pdrez de Cuellar asked that admission be given immediate attention so that the Baltics could participate in the 46th General Assembly session, which begins on September 17. The move came as the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies put off until today a key vote on whether to recognise the independence of the three republics. Although they have been recognised as independent by most western countries and by the Russian Federation of Mr Boris Yeltsin, they have still to receive an officiadal \"exit visa\" from the Soviet Union. The Congress - still for- mally the supreme law-making body in the Soviet Union - could provide such recognition, but there are fears that the By Leyla Boulton in Moscow, Gillian Tett in Vilnius, Chrystla Freeland in Kiev and agencies anti-secessionist \"Soyuz\" (Union) group may muster enough votes to block the two- thirds majority necessary for a constitutional change. A draft resolution also due to be debated today calls on the Congress to recognise the declarations of sovereignty issued over the past year by every single Soviet republic. Representatives from the three Baltic republics will today arrive in Moscow to observe the talks between the Soviet republics on future eco- nomic ties within the Union. The presence of the Baltic representatives suggests that, however keen the republics are to assert political indepen- dence, they are increasingly realistic about the need to retain economic ties with the remains of the Soviet Union. \"Sorting out the political and legal issues [about the Baltics] could take a long time at the Congress. But economic rela- tions have to be decided right away,\" explained Mr Vytas Navickas, the Lithuanian rep- resentative at the discussions. In other developments yes- terday: * The parliament of the Ukraine approved the appoint- ment of the republic's first -defence minister, General Konstantin Morozov. The move underscores the republic's determination to form its own national guard, place Ukrai- nian soldiers on all its borders, and take control of those units of the Soviet army stationed in the Ukraine. * Separatist Russians in the Transdnestr region of western Moldova agreed a compromise with Moldovian officials yester- day, backing away from a threat to cut off gas and elec- tricity to the rest of the self-de- clared independent republic. A six-strong delegation from Transdnestr, which declared itself independent from Mol- dova on Monday, also said it would return to its capital Tir- aspol to try to persuade pro- testers to stop blocking the railways. Women blockaded Tiraspol station to call for the release of Transdnestrian leader Mr Igor Smirnov from jail, where he is being held on suspicion of backing the hardline Soviet coup two weeks ago. * Azerbaijan rejected as unconstitutional the decision of the mainly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to declare its independence. Nagorno-Karabakh, where 800 people have been killed in bloody ethnic clashes over the past three years, declared itself independent on Monday, tak- ing with it the neighbouring Shaumyan district to the north, as the \"Nagorno-Kara- bakh Armenian Republic\". Workers in Azerbaijan yes- terday ignored a call by the southern republic's nationalist opposition for a general strike, local journalists said.",

   "text_content" : "By hetr Marsh THE Soviet Union's three Baltic republics look likely to share in a windfall payment of several tens of millions of dol- lars as the prize for regaining their independence. Latvia, Estonia and Lithua- nia would divide between them cash which has been piling up in a Swiss bank account for the past 52 years, ever since their assets were seized by the Soviet Union at the time of the communist takeover at the out- break of the Second World War. The money has been con- trolled over this time by the Bank for International Settle- ments, the Basle-based central bankers' bank set up in 1930. The three Baltic states were among the 21 founder members of the bank, and since the Soviet takeover the dividend payments which should have gone to them every year have been kept separately in secret bank accounts. It is likely that, assuming the Baltic states regain their independence formally over the next few months, they will set up their own central banks, at which point they will be readmitted to the BIS. Separately, the Baltic repub- lics could also lay claim to about $6m worth of gold which they entrusted to the Bank of England in the 1930s and which the Bank sold to the Soviet Union in 1968 as part of a government agreement., Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister who arrived in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius yes- terday, dald he would consider proposals to resolve the issue.",

   "text_content" : "By Quentin PeIl in Bonn A BARRAGE of criticism of continuing government profli- gacy greeted Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday after he presented a 1992 budget intended to control the soaring costs of German unification. German industrialists, in the shape of the Federation of Ger- man Industry (BDI), and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), called for spending cuts to reduce the government debt. There is no agreement, how- ever, on where the cuts should fall to allow the continued flow of cash to the collapsing east German economy. Mr Waigel yesterday put a brave face on his plan which would allow a spending increase of just 3 per cent next year, to DM422.5bn (Â£143.7bn), and a cut in the central state borrowing requirement to DM50bn (Â£17bn), instead of this year's DM66bn (Â£22.4bn). The costs of unification, he told the German parliament, were entirely justifiable, and he would not allow the ceiling on spending to be raised \"by one millimetre.\" Presentation of the budget in the Bundestag, which has until the end of November to deter- mine its final shape, was greeted with scepticism by Mr Heinrich Weiss, the BDI presi- dent, who called for far more drastic measures to curb public sector spending generally in the former West Germany. \"We must not allow the eco- nomic capacity of our country to be undermined, because pol- iticians do not have the strength or the will to resist the spending demands from all sides,\" he said at a news con- ference shortly after the bud- get speech. The real level of public sec- tor deficits, Including the indi- vidual German LAnder and state corporations, as well as the federal government, would be more than DM200bn in 1991, or 7 per cent of the gross national product, he said. The result in higher interest rates, and higher inflation, was already taking its toll of Ger- man industry. His comments coincided with industrial production sta- tistics showing a 1.2 per cent decline between June and July in the former West Germany, although activity is still well up on 1990 before German uni- fication became a reality. The BDI is increasingly con- cerned at industry's apparent loss of competitiveness, and in particular at the slump in for- eign investment in the coun- try, compared with neighbour- ing west European states. Mr Weiss said that in 1990 German companies invested DMSObn outside the country, compared with an investment inflow of only DM3bn. He forecast a continuing slowdown in the economy, based on rising taxes and duties, and the latest round of excessive wage rises outstrip- ping productivity. Mr Weiss called for further government spending reduc- tions to control the deficit, coming from reduction in state subsidies, and further cost cuts in the public sector. Mrs Ingrid MatthAus-Maier, SPD finance spokesman, focused rather on the need for defence spending cuts, and an abolition of unnecessary tax privileges. She also strongly criticised reductions in com- pany taxation, and the govern- ment's proposed 1 percentage point increase in value added tax to 15 per cent."

   "text_content" : "By David Garwner in The Hague THE European Community surprised itselesterday by the speed at Vwhi it movedo t consolidate Monday's break- through in what can cautiously- be described now as the Ygo - slav peace process. When Mr Slobodan Milos. evic, the Serbian president, ^ signed a ceasefire and media- V tion accord - gracelessly and:: reluctantly - early on Monay morning in Belgrade, it became imperative to put him and the other warring Yugoslavpartie on the spot. It was the Serbian leader's refusal to put his signature to a similar, verbal agreement on'. August 4 whith bought him' the month he naeded to carve out the slices of Croatia he wants to join to a Greater Serbia. The EC's first exercise iit international peace-brokering will thus open this Saturday at the Peace Palace in the Hague - soon enough, it is hoped, t. avoid any irrevocable breaks down in a ceasefire which has yet to take hold. The current Dutch presi- dency of the EC had scheduled the peace conference for Sep- tember 16. Pressure from Ger- many, France and Italy got the date moved forward a week to next Monday. But then, as the Twelve's foreign ministers realised why they were acceler- ating, the conference was set even earlier, for Saturday. \"The problem for us now is not to lose momentum,\" a senior Dutch official said. The preconditions for the confer- ence going ahead are: * A ceasefire in Croatia, to be verified by 200 EC monitors who start arriving today. * Disengagement beyond combat range of the contend- ing parties, including the with- drawal of the Croatian National Guard, the return to barracks of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federal army and dis- bandment of Serbian paramili- taries in Croatia. But all of this has yet to be implemented and the continu- ing fighting in Croatia on Mon- day and yesterday showed that there is a vacuum which has to be filled quickly if the accord is going to get anywhere. \"The whole country is brim- ming with weapons. Nobody can guarantee that not one sin- gle shot will fired between now and the conference,\" a senior Dutch official said. \"But equally, you can't have a con- ference if full-scale fighting is going on. You have to judge where the balance is.\" More fighting in Yugoslavia is not the sole consideration. If the balance is judged to be against a conference going ahead, then Germany warned yesterday it would recognise Croatian independence. A spokesman for Mr Hans-Diet- rich Genscher said that the German foreign minister had told a delegation of Croats yes- terday that \"if it is not possible to bring about a conference, we will go forward to recognising Croatia.\" This stance diverges from the agreed position of the Twelve, and underlines the risk of the peace process break- ing up on the side of the medi- ators as well as the Yugoslavs. Assuming the conference does go ahead, it will chaired by Lord Carrington on behalf of the EC. A separate five- strong arbitration board will be attached to the conference. The Community has named to it three eminent constitu- tional lawyers - Robert Badin- ter of France, Aldo Corrasaniti from Italy, and Roman Hertzog of Germany. The Yugoslav par- ties are to name two other members. EC foreign ministers, the Yugoslav presidency, federal government, and presidents of all six republics will kick the conference off on Saturday. Thereafter, it will divide into working groups, with the most sensitive issues put out to binding arbitration. The delin- eation of frontiers, for exam- ple, is expected to be one issue the arbitrators will have to set- tle in what looks set to be a long haul. The hope is that the arbitra- tors can to some extent \"depol- iticise\" the most intractable problems, before feeding them back into the conference. But, as Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, explained yesterday, \"accept- ing this procedure means accepting the outcome\".",

Thoughi greatly respected at home and abroad, especially for the lhading role he played in the negotiations which led to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, Lord Carrington felt it was a matter of honour for him to resign two years later, after the Foreign Office had failed to foresee the Falklands crisis. His career in British politics included several important ministerial appointments such as first lord of the Admiralty, secretary of state for energy and secretary of state for defence. He was one of the most influential figures in the Conservative party, of 'which he was chairman in 1972-74, and later became one of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's closest counsellors. Though the Falidands resig- nation ended his political career, Lord Carrington went on to become an eminently successful secretary-general of Nato from 1984-88. In this position, he became a strong advocate of the need for the west to keep up its military guard, at a time when the end of the cold war could only be dimly perceived on the hori- son. On his retirement from Nato, Lord Carrington became chairman of Christie's Interna- tional, the art auction house, a position he still holds.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Tokyo and Foreign Staff THE Japanese ministry of finance, which is preparing reforms in the wake of the recent spate of scandals, is con- sidering taking measures against inves- tors as well as stockbrokers over com- pensation payments for trading losses. The proposal was announced yester- day by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, who intends to pres- ent a package of legislative changes to parliament. These will deal with com- pensation payments and with other recently discovered wrongdoings, including links between securities com- panies and gangsters. Mr Hashimoto, apologising to a com- mittee of the upper house for lax super- vision of the broking industry, spoke in terms which were last night inte=prsted in some quarters as suggesting that he was contemplating resigning. \"I want to do as much as I can so that in the future any person taking up my Job will never have to feel the way I do now,\" he said. However, he is thought likely i to stay at least until a new securities law passes the Diet later this month. The proposal-to punish investors as well as brokers for compensation pay- ments is controversial. Some MPs oppose it because it will increase the finance ministry's powers over non-fi- nancial companies at a time when the ministry has been under attack for itself contributing to the scandals through lax supervision. Other mem- bers of parliament are concerned it would be wrong to punish investors since some may not be aware they were receiving compensation. Compenaton payments are illegal only if they are covered by a prior-guarantee. Securities companies jave admitted paying compensation but insist that they have not issued any pledges. How- ever, the ministry is investigating the possibility that some payments were covered by guarantees - it found that in 59 out of 617 cases payments were made to clients who had suffered no losses. The ministry suspects such pay. ments may relate to accounts covered by P mosl aups o scific 1rnm. that the securities companies, which have admitted making pa-ments upto March 1990, also paid compefsatn after that date. Firm evidence of mr recent payments would bring fresh embarrassment to the astockbrokni groups since it would expose reports they have filed to the ministry as incomplete. * Mr Susmu Ishii, frmer chairman of the Inugawaka crime syndicate who had been lked to the securities scan- dal, died yesterday at 67. He had been in hospital for some time."

   "text_content" : "By John Ridding in Seoul FOREIGN investors will be allowed to buy up to 10 per cent of the shares in most South Korean companies from the beginning of next year, according to final market open- ing guidelines announced yes- terday by the country's finance ministry. The guidelines, which were largely in line with expecta- tions, allow for only a gradual opening of the country's stock market. The market, which is capitalised at about $11Obn (Â£65.4bn), is the the fifth larg- est in Asia. The 10 per cent limit on for- eign investment will apply to all companies listed on the stock exchange other than pub- lic utilities or strategic indus- tries. Companies engaged in these areas, such as Posco, the country's largest steel com- pany, will have a foreign own- ership limit of 8 per cent. Other companies, which are barred by Korean law from having foreign investors, will remain off limits. This restric- tion will apply to Kepco, the state electricity company. Foreign securities companies in Seoul said that the guide- lines still left a number of important questions unclear. For example, the announce- ment failed to clarify whether strategic foreign invest- ments - such as the 10 per cent of the shares in Kia Motors which are held by Ford of the US - will count towards the foreign ownership ceiling. \"The guidelines provide a certain broad framework,\" said Mr Philip Smiley, chief repre- sentative of Jardine Fleming, one of the four foreign securi- ties companies given permis- sion to set up a branch in SeouL \"But there are still a number of technical issues which must be resolved prior to market opening.\" These include the procedures for dealing and commission arrangements and the practi- calities of repatriating profits and dividends. According to the guidelines, the ceilings on foreign owner- ship will include existing Euro- market issues such as convert- ible bonds, country funds and bonds with warrants. The only exclusions will be for unit trusts and recently issued matching funds. These have a combined value of about 0.7 per cent of the Korean market. Foreign brokers estimate that between $2bn and $4bn of foreign capital will flow into the Korean market in 1992. The market, which saw dramatic growth in the late 1980s has slumped since then. It is one of the few Asian markets to have fallen this year, but is expected to recover as the date for market opening approaches. South Korean business leaders yesterday attacked the government's proposed budget for next year, con- demning it as inflationary and calling for a spending reeze, John Ridding reports. The proposed budget, which plans a 24 per cent rise in spending to Won33,500bn (Â£7bn) is cur- rently being discussed by the ruling Democratic Liberal party before being submitted to the national assembly. But there is growing criti- cism over South Korea's ris- ing rate of inflation. Con- sumer prices increased by 8.3 per cent in the first eight months of the .ear, the biM- gest rise for 10 years. Several of the country's most powerful business groups, including the Seder- ation of Korean Industry, the Korea Chamber of Com- merce and Industry and the Korean Employers' Associa- tion, attacked a plan to raise civil service salaries by 12.4 per cent. \"This violates the govern- ment's own policy of keeping wage increases below 10 per cent,\" said an SKI official. \"It will make it much harder to restrain pay awards next year.\" The government argues that a sharp increase in expenditure is necessary to Improve the country's infra- structure. It iSmplementng ambitious plans for roads railways, ports and power stations. It pledged other step to rduce the rate of Inflatlon and to keep consumer price rises within its target of 10 per cent for the year. Mr Choi Gak Kyu, the dep uty prime minister and min- Jiter for economic plannln, mid yesterday that inflation would be tamed by maintain- Ing the growth of the money supply at between 17 and 19 per cent for the rest of the year and by cooling the boom in the private con- struction sector.",

   "text_content" : "By Jullan Ozanne, recently in Kinshasa THE ZAIREAN capital Kinshasa was brought to a standstill yesterday as the country's pro-democracy move- ment, fighting to oust Presi- dent Mobutu Sese Seko, tight- ened a strike in the city a day after police killed at least one person in anti-government rioting. The civil service-led strike call, which closed some govern- ment offices and brought traf- sic to a halt, came after police used teargas and clubs on Mon- day to disperse demonstrators who rioted and erected barri- cades in the poorer suburbs of Kinshasa. The clashes have exposed tensions as the country heads deeper into political and eco- nomic crisis. Hyperinflation, estimated conservatively at an annual rate of 1,500 per cent, critical shortages of foreign exchange for vital imports, and conspicuous consumption by the political elite have created a discontented urban population. Fears are growing that the strike and demonstrations, if prolonged, could affect Zaire's production of copper, cobalt and diamonds. The opposition is seeking to force Mr Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, to allow a repre- sentative national conference on the country's political and constitutional future. An attempt to hold such a confer- ence failed in the face of a boy- cott after Mr Mobutu packed the meeting with 000 bogus del- egates and security men loyal o t his regime.",

   "text_content" : "By John Murray Brown in .Ankara PHILIP Morris, the US cigarette maker, already the largest private buyer of Turk- ish tobacco, yesterday won government approval for a $Oft (28.77m) joint venture investment to produce its Marlboro brand in Turkey. The desl repreents Turkey's largest single investment this year and further redues pro- tection for local producers. It also takes considerable pres- sure off Turkey's balance of payments, given substantial cigarette import costs. The decision follows Ank- ara's liberalisation of the tobacco sector in May, which paved the way for investors to price and distribute their own products and import tobaccos for blending, activities until now handled by Tekel, the state tobacco monopoly. BAT Industries of the UK and the American company RI. Reynolds are in talks with the Turkish Investment board and are expected to follow suit. Turkey is the world's sixth largest tobacco grower. Domestic consumption is growing at about 2.5 per cent a year and stands at 77,000 tonnes a year. Turkey's tobacco sector has attracted little foreign interest hitherto, largely because of Tekel's domestic monopoly. Rothmans set up a small investment in Bitlis in Eastern Turkey in 1987 to produce the local Best brand. High import tariffs and the development of locally-made American blend cigarettes had given Tekel an apparently unassailable position in the local market, where it controls some 80 per cent of sales. Under the new rules, a com- pany is still required to instal a fully-integrated factory, a disincentive to the small inves- tor. Investors will also only be allowed to import brands they already produce locally. At full capacity, the Philip Morris plant will produce around 30,000 tonnes, the equivalent of 30bn cigarettes a year.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Thonnmson in Tokyo THE Japanese government is reviewing the flow of informa- tion back to the US on develop- ments in military-related US technology. The technology is improved by Japanese corporations, working under licence. Japan is sensitive to US Congress criticism that the US military has become over-reliant on for- eign suppliers for high technol- ogy, and that some of these suppliers were slow to respond to US needs during the Gulf war. Senior Japanese Defence Agency officials indicated yes- terday that they would use a regular bilateral meeting later this month to emphasise that Japanese companies are will- ing to transfer information on refinements made to US tech- nology. The two countries have an agreement for joint develop- ment in five military-related areas, including ceramic engines and rocket technology, while Japanese companies have various other research projects designed to upgrade US aircraft and missile tech- nology. Defence Agency officials expect the US will raise the unauthorised exports to Iran of missile parts and aircraft elec- tronics by one Japanese com- pany. These exports were used to upgrade US-made technol- ogy used by the Iranian mili- tary. \"We realise that the US has some concerns about technol- ogy development and we will do our best to make sure they have access to the latest tech- nology. We are aware they want more information about advancements by Japanese companies,\" a Defence Agency official said.",

   "text_content" : "MR Christopher Steffen is a man who sud- denly got religion: three years ago, before he joined Honeywell, the large US manufacturer of controls, he knew or cared little about one of the hottest topics in interna- tional trade - the protection of intellectual property. Now, however, he is a pas- sionate advocate of a global agreement to safeguard com- mercial ideas. The reason for his conversion is simple: a long-running patent dispute between Honeywell, where he is chief financial officer, and Minolta, the Japanese camera manufacturer, which will go to trial on September 19 in a fed- eral court in New Jersey. The case is important for Hone- ywell, which claims to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in potential royalties. But the company maintains it is also important for the American high-technology industry as a whole, which the US government reckons is los- ing up to $60bn (Â£35.7bn) a year, through what it afleges as the international piracy of its ideas. Mr Steffen argues that tech- nological ideas are one of the US's few remaining areas of comparative industrial advan- tage and that \"if we don't pay attention, we're going to throw away an investment of a cou- ple of hundred years\". he Minolta suit, he says \"puts a stake in the ground and shows we're not going to roll over and play dead\". The case revolves around the invention in the 1960s and 1970s by Mr Norman Stauffer, a Honeywell employee, of autofocusing tech- nology for single lens reflex cameras. The company had a photo products division when this work first began and, although that has long since been sold, the company holds about 80 patents relating to the technol- ogy. Honeywell signed so-called \"advance disclosure agree- ments\" with several Japanese companies in the late 1970s, giving them information which would allow them to incorpo- rate its invention in their cam- eras. The company claims in its suit that Minolta engineers involved in this project set up a secret parallel programme designed to develop a substi- tate to the Honeywell process and thus avoid royalty pay- ments. Minolta was the first com- pany to introduce autofocus cameras, which it did in 1985 with its popular Maxxum 35m mo de, and its lead has since been followed by.mmny other Japanese companies, Nilta w NLkk m h.P tax sad which Hone- Ywell argmes may also have violatied i pitaen.

Minolta's sales of auto-fo- cus cameras are estimated by Honeywell to be running at about $lbn a year in the US alone, and the alleged patent infringements date back to the mid-1980s, representing a very large stream of potential royal- ties. The US group would fol- low up a New Jersey victory with suits against the 15 other Japanese companies with which it is in dispute. The climate for pursuing patent cases in the US has improved markedly over the past decade. Plaintiffs used to be viewed suspiciously by the courts, as potential monopo- lists. However, the Reagan administration established a special federal patents appeals court in Washington in 1982 which has done much to ensure uniform standards in patents cases. 'The Minolta suit puts a stake in the ground andsbphws we're not going to roll over and play dead': Martin Dickson reports While the court denies it, the legal profession says statistics suggest that a patentee's chances of winning a suit have improved significantly in recent years. At the same time, there has been a Oharp increase in the value of dam- ages awarded. Congress has also helped, with a 1988 amend- ment to section 337 of the Tar- iff Act of 1930. The Tariff Act allowed US manufacturers to petition the International Trade Commission to ban the import of products they claimed infringed their patents. The amendment extended this right from manu- facturers to include companies which had made a substantial investment in the development of a technology or a significant effort to license it amendment in its fight against Minolta, which had been dragging through the courts since 1987 and might not reach trial before the US company's patents begin to expire in 1992. It appled last year to the ITC for an import ban, explaining to the court that it was doing so out t frus- tration at the legil delays. That in turn prompted the judge in the patent 'ase to expedite the headit this month. I Mr Steffen argues that its success with Section ediaer lines the need fowr an aterna- tional framework to kprtect intellectual property which will include controls eh the import of goods ulllda eas US compni ebiber own, and a.m.cllsor speedy reselutiot dwisuites.

In-a speech in Maine, en route to Washington. after a month-long holiday dominated by the Soviet crisis, Mr Bush cast himself in the role of an \"education president\" commit- ted to raising standards in schools. In the next four weeks the White House has scheduled trips to at least 10 other states to show that Mr Bush has a domestic agenda on which to contest next year's election. The focus will be on education, as well as the administration's crime and transportation bills. Democrats led by Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, believe domestic issues are Mr Bush's Achilles' heel. Turning to education yesteri- day, Mr Bush seized on last. week's news that scores in the verbal scholastic aptitude tests a broad, nationalmeasure ds performance at high school - had fallen to their lowest level sidWe 1983. The figures showed that, although the percentage of US students who score highly has remained consistent for a decade, the low scorers are fall. ing further behind. Some educational experts warn the system is creating an educational dlite and an under- class of students in high school. Individual states, rather than the federal government, bear most of the burden of run- ning and funding schools. Mr Bush has avoided promising more federal money, relyng instead on the \"Amerca& 20(X prograihme - a joint effort with state governors to Oet education goals to be achieved by the end of the century.

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington US manufacturing continued to revive last month as new orders increased sharply, according to statistics pub- lished yesterday by the National Association of Pur- chasing Management (NAPM). The purchasing managers' index, which provides a widely watched early measure of the industrial economy's health, rose to 54.8 per cent in August, its highest level for nearly three years. This was the third consecu- tive month in which it stood above 50 per cent, indicating the manufacturing economy is expanding. Government economic statis- tics in the last few weeks have given contradictory signals of the health of the US economy, but the purchasing managers' index provides support for esti- mates that the economy is now recovering reasonably strongly from recession. Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM, said his associa- tion's index had averaged 45.1 per cent for the first eight months of the year, which past experience showed would be consistent with a growth rate of only 0.4 per cent in the whole economy. If the index remained at August's level, however, this would be consistent with real growth of about 1.4 per cent for the full year. The rise in the index was fuelled by the fourth consecu- tive monthly increase in new orders. New export orders also continued to grow. Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose by 1.6 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $404.9bn (Â£241bn), the first increase since April. However, spending was still 10.6 per cent lower than a year earlier.",

   "text_content" : "B RAZIL's economic policymakers are attempting to end the country's international sinan- cial isolation which has per- sisted since it suspended pay- ments on its foreign debt, the developing world's largest, in July 1989. New hopes have emerged of an agreement with the Interna- tional Monetary Fund, and Brazil's recent proposal for rescheduling its $52bn (Â£30.9bn) medium- and long-term commercial debt has been greeted as realistic by surprised creditors. \"What you are seeing now is a realisation that we have to be part of the world,\" Mr Arminio Fraga, international director of the central bank, explained yesterday. Thus while economic news at home worsens daily - with inflation rising to more than 15 per cent last month - nearly all senior officials of Brazil's Economy Ministry and central bank are abroad negotiating with foreign institutions. Mr Roberto Macedo, the chief economic policy secre- tary, is in Washington this week for talks with the IMF. Negotiations with the fund for a standby facility reopened in June after a letter of intent signed last year was torn up when the government failed to meet economic targets. A new agreement is vital as a guarantee before creditor banks agree on a restructuring. Brazilian officials say they hope for a new letter of intent by the annual IMF meet- ing in Bangkok next month. Mr Fraga said. yesterday: \"We're not going to shoot for an extended fund facility but we hope to get an 18-month agreement for more than $lbn which we could subsequently turn into an EFF.\" An EFF programme usually lasts for three years. Brazil is hoping through credits from Japan to augment the collateral needed to back the concessional Brady bonds which it proposes to offer to banks as part of its debt pro- posal. Mr Marcilio Marques Mor- eira, economy minister, arrived in Tokyo yesterday to sign a loan agreement for $478m - the first loan from the Japa- nese government since 1986. On Friday Mr Moreira will go to Paris for talks with Mr Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Paris Club of creditor gov- ernments, with which Brazil must also negotiate. She flurry of overseas activity which leaves only two senior officials in the Economy Ministry in Brasilia marks a radical change of strategy for the gov- ernment of President Fernando Collor de Mello. It had previ- ously insisted it had to resolve internal problems before begin- ning external talks, believing this would enable negotiation from a position of strength. The administration appears to have at least half an eye on the success of Mexico, whose debt restructuring deal -. con- cluded last year - provided Brazil FGV Price Index 20 15 10 5 n - Jan 1991 Aug Source: Gtulbo Vargas Foundation the backdrop for increasing confidence in the country's economic prospects. Senator Roberto Campos, a former planning minister, said: \"Brazil has belatedly realised that playing the tough guy just irritates people and brings no benefit and that there is a link between internal and external adjustment.\" However, an adviser to Mr Collor had a dif- ferent explanation: \"The presi- dent is fed up with being seen on his travels abroad as the man who doesn't pay his bills.\" The change in the Brazilian stance was made possible by a replacement of Brazil's entire economic team in May and the appointment of Mr Moreira in place of the confrontational Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello, who had infuriated bankers with her aggressive manner, delay- ing an agreement on the repay- ment of more than $8bn in past due interest until April. Brazil made its first payment on arrears in July and is already benefiting from its new consensual approach; the Inter- American Bank has agreed loans exceeding $lbn over the next two years. After suffering a net outflow of capital over the past three years the country's recent opening of its stock exchange to foreign investors has attracted considerable interest, bringing in $140m in August alone. Last month a Eurobond issue in London by Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil com- pany, drew so much interest that the issue was raised from $100m to $250m and the com- pany now plans a further $200m. The Petrobras issue marked the first time a debtor country, technically in arrears and with no agreement with its credi- tors, has been able to return to the world capital markets. But Brazilian officials are under no illusion that import- ing virtue and capital from abroad will succeed in impos- ing the domestic stability that the government has so far failed to achieve. An IMF agreement may be threatened by predictions of a 2 per cent Treasury deficit this year. At the same time, another change of economy minister or - against the back- drop of widespread public cyni- cism - a sixth shock economic programme in six years could jeopardise any accord with creditors and quickly staunch capital inflows."

But the Post Office would reduce the current two daily deliveries to one. Sir Bryan Nicholson, Post Office chairman, said yesterday in .his first interview since the government announced its decision to sduce the letters monopoly that the proposals enabled him to put forward his own options for change. He said: \"The advantage of liberal- isation is that it provides the public with a rationale for change. \"It is very difficult to explain changes when you are a monopoly; it is much easier when you are operating in the marketplace.\" In July, Mr * Peter Llpy, trade and indust secretary, aipounced plans to reduce the delivery charge under which the Post Oce retained its monopoly to about the cost of a first class-stamp - to be raised to 24p next week.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Juliet Sychrava NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear company, and British Nuclear Fuels, which sells and reprocesses nuclear fuel, will today announce what they claim is the biggest contract ever signed between two parties in the UK. The value of the con- tract, which is expected to last 15 years and be backdated to 1989, will be announced today. The agreement could open the way for Nuclear Electric to opt for a long-term alternative to reprocessing spent fuel from its advanced gas-cooled (AGR) reactors at a time when the alternative of storing fuel on site is increasingly viewed as more economic and environ- mentally acceptable. The agreement may bring big cost savings to the com- pany. Spent fuel from the Mag- nox reactors is unsuitable for storage, and so has to be re- processed, and Nuclear Electric is locked into reprocessing AGR fuel in the short term. Scottish Nuclear, the com- pany's sister organisation in Scotland, has already made clear its preference for on-site \"dry storage\". Today's contract follows more than a year of talks dur- ing which Nuclear Electric has tried to cut costs by replacing with a fixed-price contract the open-ended cost-plus contracts with BNFL that date from the days of the Central Electricity Generating Board. The contract is expected to cover the 10 years to 2002 after the start-up at Sellafield. in Cumbria next year of BNFL's Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp). It is also expec- ted to cover the purchase of about 1,800 tonnes of AGR fuel. There is unlikely, however, to be a full commitment to reprocessing beyond 2002. Industry and environmental group sources said yesterday that Nuclear Electric might wait to see how the Scottish company's dry-storage pro- posal succeeded. That could spell trouble for Thorp, the environmental group Friends of the Earth said yesterday. \"BNFL desperately needs contracts for 2002 onwards,\" said Mr Simon Roberts, FoE energy cam- paigner. \"Even a contract from Nuclear Electric won't keep Thorp's head above water.\" Thorp was criticised as uneco- nomic in December last year by Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit. BNFL said yesterday it had contracts with German electrical utilities worth Â£800m for the second 10 years of Thorpe's life. Nuclear Electric said it viewed reprocessing and dry storage as technically and environmentally equal, and would opt for the more eco- nomic of the two. Friends of the Earth said reprocessing produced large volumes of nuclear waste as well as redundant plutonium and uranium. Business and the Environ- ment. Page 12",

   "text_content" : "I guaru poince in nio gear pauu asu e indsworth shops were velncies stonea By Andrew Jack POLICE in riot gear clashed with youths for the fifth evening running on the Blackbird Leys housing estate, Oxford, late last night. As up to 100 officers moved in to clear the square in front of the Blackbird pub, where more than 150 youths had gathered, bottles and stones were thrown at them. About half-a-dozen arrests were made on the Ely Estate, Cardiff, although the atmosphere was said to be less tense than on previous nights. The third area which has seen clashes with police, Handsworth in Bir- mingham, was quiet last night. Yesterday, Mr John Patten, minister of state at the Home Office, condemned the rioting in the three cities and ordered urgent police reports on the disturbances. \"I utterly condemn this mindless hooliganism and yobbery for which there can be absolutely no excuse,\" he said. The Home Office has backed the police in playing down the incidents, arguing that the outbreaks were essen- tially local incidents caused by oppor- tunism combined with alcohol and the exceptionally hot weather. However, all three took place in depressed urban areas characterised by high unemploy- ment and a concentration of social problems. West Midlands police arrested 19 peo- ple on Monday night after 200 officers arrived to quell looting in shops in Handsworth. Three police vehicles were stoned but no injuries were reported. The looting began after a blackout on Monday evening when the fire brigade turned off an electricity sub-station in danger from a nearby fire. About 40 people have been arrested sinced Friday night on the Ely Estate, Cardiff, where crowds of up to 300 gath- ered to throw bricks and petrol bombs. There have been no injuries. The trou- ble started after Mr Abdul Waheed, a local Asian shopkeeper, obtained an injunction against a neighbouring shop to prevent it selling bread and nfllk. A woman was yesterday recovering in hospital from severe stab wounds after clashes the previous night in Oxford. The woman's boyfriend and a police constable were also injured. The clashes started after police acted to pre- vent joy-riding through the estate in stolen cars, sometimes in front of crowds of up to 100 spectatators.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent THE PRIVATE sector should be given the opportunity to build a freight-only rail line from the Channel tunnel to Scotland, according to a report from the National Economic Development Council pub- lished today. It warns that British indus- try will suffer higher costs, growing congestion and less reliable delivery times if the so-called rail spine is not built. The report, by the NEDC's construction industry sector group, says the opening of the tunnel in 1998 will create the opportunity for more interna- tional freight to go by rail. Continental Europe, it says, is already moving towards the use of combined transport, whereby freight loads are transferred from lorries to trains for the long-distance part of their journey. But, the report says, Britain is in danger of being excluded from this new European com- bined transport system because UK railways lack the clearances necessary for wider and taller European trains. It says the government should study the feasibility of building a continental-size freight railway from the Chan- nel tunnel to the north and invite the private sector to build it, as with the tunnel itself.

The ASA said it had received more than 800 complaints about the poster, which depicts a blood-smeared newborn baby. Benetton had been advised by the ASA before the cam- paign that the poster, produced in Italy, was \"likely to cause great offence\". The ASA council has ruled that the poster is \"offensive and could cause shock and dis- tress\" although it does not have statutory powers to ban the advertisement. It has warned Benetton that posters \"should have regard for gen- eral standards of decency and propriety\". The ASA has also criticised Benetton's advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson, and the poster contractors. Graduate job offers concern COMPANIES affected by the recession are reneging on job offers to graduates, Mr Keith Dugdale, chairman of the Asso- ciation of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, said yester- day. He told the association's annual conference that equal- opportunity recruitment poli- cies were at risk because those employers still recruiting were overwhelmed by applicants. Average starting salaries had fallen during the past three months, he said, and there was no sign that the drop in graduate employment had bottomed out.

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith A FINANCIAL strategy involving national savings tar- gets as well as the familiar call for rapid progress towards European economic and mone- tary union was outlined by the Liberal Democrats yesterday as the party attempted to enhance its economic credibility. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, said that the policies in Economics for the Future represented \"the first comprehensive new piece of economic thinking in Britain since the advent of the term 'monetarism' into our political lexicon\". The paper will be discussed at next week's party confer- ence in Bournemouth and rep- resents the first time the Lib- eral Democrats have had a comprehensive economic strat- egy to debate. At the heart of the party's macroeconomic policy is the proposal that government's sis- cal stance should be devised not to obtain a balanced bud- get over the medium term, but to \"ensure that total saving in the economy, including both public and private saving, meets target levels\". The paper includes a com- mitment to an independent central bank, which underpins the anti-inflation strategy. It includes a plan for replacing mortgage-interest relief with a housing-cost relief weighted towards those most in need and available to those renting as well as purchasers. The latter relief would be intended to assist labour mobility and prevent another housing surge. It also addresses the need for regional pay bargaining and envisages a top rate of tax, including national insurance contributions, of 49 per cent or 50 per cent. Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said that competition policy would be tougher, with strengthened powers for a more independent Monopolies and Mergers Com- mission, so that it had more ability to intervene. But politi- cians would have less scope to influence competition policy decisions. The party wishes, in particu- lar, to see more competition in the banking sector services available to businesses, and there were signs that it might look to building societies to be given a greater- role. Mr Ashdown said that the party had commissioned fur- ther studies on restrictive prac- tices, and on anti-trust laws similar to those in the US. He said more work would be done to flesh out ideas he had raised at last year's party con- ference: how to break up BT and how to enable private-sec- tor services to operate on the British Rail network. The MMC would be able to forbid a merger or takeover not only for reasons of competition and monopoly, but also for other reasons. One example given by the party is that the proposed merger would seri- ously reduce the amount of research and development undertaken by the companies involved. The paper advocates a shift away from taxes on income to taxes on pollution and use of non-renewable resources, although the party acknowl- edges that environmental taxes will not replace wealth taxes in the immediate future.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent THE latest survey of independent forecasters moni- tored by the Treasury shows a slight deterioration in UK growth expectations this year in spite of the improvement in business sentiment over the past month. The August survey of 26 City and non-City forecasters yielded an average forecast of a 2.1 per cent decline in gross domestic product this year. This compares with average expectations of a 2 per cent decline in GDP in June. It is, however, in line with the find- ings of the Financial Times summer compilation of fore- casts, published on Monday. For 1992, the Treasury sur- vey indicated average expecta- tions of 1.9 per cent growth. This is unchanged from the result of its June survey, but slightly more optimistic than the FT compilation which pointed to GDP growth of 1.72 per cent next year. The latest Treasury survey includes a review of medium- term projections from a nar- rower group of eight City and non-City forecasters. The aver- age of this group suggests that GDP growth will recover to 2.6 per cent in 1993 and 2.7 per cent in 1994."

   "text_content" : "By Norms Cohen, Investments Correspondent THE Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imnro), the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has published a revised rulebook that greatly reduces the investor protection that professional money man- agers enjoyed previously. The old rules, however, still apply to so-called private clients - people who are investing their own money. Imro is the first self-regulat- ing body to release a new rule- book intended to comply with the Securities and Investments Board's core rules - broad principles aimed at protecting consumers of investment ser- vices. The rulebook has been tentatively approved by SIB and will take effect from November 30. Imro has reduced the length of the rules and simplified them. Under the revised rule- book, professional money man- agers will no longer be required to enter into pre- scribed customer agreements with investment managers. Such agreements require investment managers, among other things, to make decisions that best suit each client and to offer best execution on all deals. Professionals will be allowed to sign much simpler agreements. The rulebook also allows Imro to establish a register of investment professionals who have been disciplined for breaches of rules. Imro said that SIB had rejected a proposed rule that would have lifted the require- ment that investment manag- ers disclose their soft commission arrangements - commission paid in the form of services - to professional cli- ents, if the client agreed. * Public disquiet about the risks of investing in financial futures and options has forced Prudential Holborn, the UK's largest fund management group, to postpone its planned launch of a unit trust investing in this sector, probably until next year, John Authers writes. SIB cleared the way for unit trusts to invest in futures and options funds (Foss) earlier this year. Geared futures and options funds where up to 20 per cent of the fund can be invested in futures and options, were particularly con- troversial in the industry because it is possible for these funds to lose all their money. Prudential Holborn was the only company to declare a firm intention to launch a geared Sos. The launch date was planned for October this year.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent MR JOHN WAKEHAM, energy secretary, yesterday rejected some of the arguments advanced for relocating part of the Department of Energy from London to Aberdeen. Scottish Enterprise, the offi- cial economic development body, says moving the Explora- tion and Development Appraisal Unit (Eadu), which regulates oilfield development, to Aberdeen would attract oil company head offices to the city. It says the move would also achieve the \"critical mass\" needed to make Aberdeen Europe's leading centre of oil expertise. At present that expertise is split between Lon- don and Aberdeen. The move, which would involve fewer than 100 civil servants, is strongly opposed by Energy Department staff, but has been backed by the Commons energy committee. Mr Wakeham, speaking in Aberdeen at the start of the bienidal Offshore Europe exhi- bition, said the case against relocation was \"substantially stronger than some reports say.\" He added: \"It is clearly not sensible that officials who are advising ministers on policy should be located in a different part of the country from the rest of the government.\" He emphasised, however, that he still had an open mind on the issue. Scottish Enterprise argues that a unified oil centre could create 15,000 jobs in the UK, many of them in Scotland. Mr Wakeham warned the off- shore industry against compla- cency in spite of current record levels of activity and invest- ment. He said the speed with which North Sea activity had taken off in the past 18 months had taken many UK companies in the sector by surprise. As a result, some large orders had been lost to continental com- petitors.",

   "text_content" : "By Vanessa Houlder, Property Correspondent UNIT TRUSTS which allow private investors to put money into commercial property have been launched by Norwich Union and Barclays Unicorn, the investment groups. The trusts are the first to be authorised by the Securities and Investments Board, the City regulator, for marketing to private investors. In the past, property unit trusts had to pay capital gains tax on profits, so that they were attractive only to tax-exempt pension fuinds. The new Authorised Prop- erty Unit Trusts (Aputs) have been launched in the belief that the commercial property market is at its lowest ebb. \"We take the view that com- mercial property is at the bot- tom of the cycle,\" said Mr Paul Ashby, marketing manager at Barclays Unicorn. \"This year we have the opportunity to pick up proper- ties at a price we would not have dreamed of a couple of years ago,\" said Mr Chris Lax- ton, a fund manager at Nor- wich Union. Mr Laxton said that, in the short term, income rather than capital gain would be the main attraction of the trust. The poor performance of res- idential and commercial prop- erty over the past few years is likely to dampen,the appeal of the funds for the pub)ic. A fur- ther disadvantage is the illiq- uid nature of property invest- ment. In an attempt to overcome this, only 80 per cent of the funds in the new trusts will be put into property. Both Aputs are based on existing funds. The Norwich Union Property Trust, which was launched a year ago, already has Â£53m committed. The Barclays Unicorn Property Trust owns property worth Â£20m.",

   "text_content" : "WEAK SECURITY at the City of London offices of Industrial Bank of Japan was exploited in an unsuccessful attempt to steal more than Â£4m, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday. Nineteen unissued certifi- cates of deposit were stolen from the bank and were pres- ented in June 1990 for pay- ment, Mr Michael Hill QC, prosecuting, said. The unissued certificates had been kept in a locked safe at the bank. The key to the safe was kept in a locked drawer, and the key to that drawer in an officer's jacket. Certificates honoured by the bank were stored in a cabinet by another officer. The key to the cabinet was kept in an unlocked drawer. One week- end, the key was placed with the bank's messengers and maintenance engineers while the cabinet was moved. Many of the honoured cert- ificates went missing and, it was alleged, were used as the basis for authenticating the stolen unissued certificates. Mr Thomas Farrelly, of Islington, London, denies theft and two offences of handling stolen goods. Four others, Mr Jonathan Alder of south Lon- don, Mr Anthony Parris of Islington, London, Mr Stephen Medlen of Erith, Kent, and Mr John Traynor of Kilburn, Lon- don, deny handling stolen goods.

   "text_content" : "By Llsa Wood, Labour Staff THE NUMBER of apprentices joining manufacturing compa- nies in the engineering indus- try this summer has dropped by an average of about 30 per cent, the new Engineering Training Authority said yester- day. The ETA, which was estab- lished this month after the winding up of the statutory Engineering Industry Training Board, was responding to a claim by Mr Bill Jordan, presi- dent of the AEU engineering union, that the number of craft and technician apprentices joining the engineering manu- facturing industry this year had fallen by about 40 per cent. Mr Jordan is a member of the National Training Task Force, a government-appointed body of senior industrialists and trade union leaders, and is also a board member of the ETA. He made his claim about apprentices at the TUC confer- ence in Glasgow. He said there was widespread concern in the country about the level of recruitment into the industry and the possibility that poorer training schemes were being introduced. He said he had urged the government to pro- vide extra funds to assist train- ing in the sector. The ETA said that inquiries in June at a representative sample of engineering training centres suggested that employ- ment of craft and technician apprentices would fall by between 25 per cent and 50 per cent, with an average of about 30 per cent. It said the Mid- lands appeared to be worst affected. Mr Pennant Jones, of the ETA, said the main reason for the reduction in recruits at every level in the industry was the recession, with cuts in gov- ernment allowances for young people taken on under the aus- pices of Youth Training a less significant reason. Last year engineering manu- facturing companies recruited about 9,000 craft and techni- cian apprentices, after a fall to about 7,000 in the mid 1980s. In the late 1970s about 20,000 trainees were taken on. Mr Jones said some compa- nies were expressing worries about skill shortages when the recession ended.",

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff THE UNION representing top civil servants yesterday said there was evidence of sex dis- crimination in its members' pay, and threatened legal action if the government failed to act. Ms Elizabeth Symons, gen- eral secretary of the Associa- tion of First Division Civil Ser- vants (FDA), said Treasury figures showed 52 per cent of top male civil servants quali- fied for extra performance- related payments, while only 38 per cent of top women did so. When the Treasury was con- fronted with the disparity, it admitted the figures showed \"a worrying imbalance\", Ms Symons told Congress in a speech supporting a motion on equal rights. After several years of performance-related pay in the Civil Service the system had revealed itself as having potential for allowing sexual discrimination to flour- ish, she said. The FDA examined perfor- mance awards to about 16,000 civil servants in Grades Five to Seven - which broadly cover the graduate intake into the service - taking only those of equal seniority at the top of the pay scales. The disparities between men and women were the same for the three grades, Ms Symons added. Women make up about 20 per cent of Equality aemana: suzaDe\"ui symoTs y.merayo uimn pay imbalances between top male and female cvil servants employees at those levels. She said later that the pat- tern was likely to be similar throughout the Civil Service and that problems would increase if discretionary pay elements rose under the gov- ernment's Citizen's Charter. The union had asked for a full Treasury check of all the figures as part of its review of performance pay agreed during this year's salary negotiations. The union would decide whether to take equal pay cases after the review was completed in October. Until a full analysis had been carried out it was difficult to tell at what point in the process discrimination was taking place, Ms Symons said. The Treasury said it would examine the issues raised by the FDA as part of an agreed review of performance-related pay."

   "text_content" : "IT MAY seem hard to believe, but the TUC recently rejected moving to a biennial congress because the annual get- together plays \"an outstanding role in publicising and promo- ting the trade union move- ment\". After yesterday's ill-tempered debate over employment law, union bosses may be wondering whether publicity and promotion are not mutually incompatible. The debate was a straight replay of last year's argy-bargy between those who want to repeal some anti-trade union laws and those who want to repeal all anti-trade union laws. The defeat of those who believe that the 1970s were the golden years of industrial rela- tions was pretty conclusive last year, but that didn't stop Congress devoting almost two hours to a reprise of the argu- ments. This year, the Labour party had awarded its seal of elec- toral safety to a 1,500-word motion attractively dubbed Composite Four. Composites are motions compiled by spatchcocking all resolutions TUE NOTEBOOK By John Willman on a particular subject into one motion containing everything including the kitchen sink. The ideal composite allows unions supporting diametri- cally opposed policies to vote for the same resolution. Unfor- tunately this could not be achieved on such a thorny sub- ject, but Composite Four still managed to range extensively from self-employment in the building industry to the Euro- pean Social Charter. The composite was moved by Ron Todd, the retiring leader of the TGWU, in what is likely to be his TUC swan-song. Todd is one of a dying breed of leaders in the modern trade union movement: he didn't go to university and he has actually worked in a factory. A likeable character with a ready wit, Todd's speeches have offered some memorable headlines in recent years. His attack on yuppies toting Silo- faxes and mobile phones derailed Neil Kinnock's relaunch of the Labour party at its 1988 conference. And he memorably attacked High Court judges who were awoken at night and revived with a whiff of brandy to issue ex parte injunctions which led to the seizure of union funds. Arthur Scargill unsportingly reminded him that the TGWU had previously backed the repeal of all Conservative trade-union legislation. Mr Todd replied that he was \"not interested in arguments about the width of a butterfly's wings when my members are being slaughtered from Land's End to John o'Groats\". This revelation swung Con. gress convincingly behind Composite Four. But, as Nor- man Willis put it, the TUC had indulged in \"an annual media jamboree as regular as the boat race but a lot less popular\"."

   "text_content" : "|s njobasa ar ket manager n was 55. \"My nerves sufferd after two armed hold-ups,\" be explains. ItJhought rd better That was fivears ago and, like many workers of hs age, he has bean stick dicetn th si a job that pays a basic rate of less than Â£ anihour. That puts it below the pinimum wage pionsed th Labo party. hch isexpcted to be backed by Congress today. Mr Parker earns Â£.59 an hour for his day- time shift as a guardfor a lead- ing contract security company. Beginners in the job earn Â£285 an hour, and those working nights receive an extra Â£1.50 for a shift of 18 hours. When Mrs Lauren King, a sewing machinist with more than 20 years' experience, is on top form she can earn about Â£190 for a 89-hour week. To achieve that, the weather has to be right - as the tempera- ture climbs inside the factory, her productivity drops. Her earnings are based on the number of garments she can complete, with a minimum rate set by a wages council of Â£100, equivalent to Â£2.60 an hour. \"It isn't good, but this trade has never been good,\" Mrs King says. Both Mr Parker and Mrs King (not their real names, for neither wants to risk losing their employment, however poorly paid) work perfectly legally for above-board compa- nies. Unions and campaigning groups such as the Low Pay Unit say such employees are the tip of a low-pay iceberg. As Mr Soner Erden, a regional organiser in the hotel and catering industry for the GMB general union, explained \"There is no bottom line. There is one well-known Soho restau- rant, for example, that has no pay slips. Earnings are from tips, and that's it.\" Even in sec- tors covered by wages councils, rates are difficult to police. It is with pay rates such as these in mind that unions, par- nourny minimum wage proposea oy me Lauour parLy ticularly those representing lower-paid workers in the pub- lic sector, have been pressing for a minimum wage. Congress is due today to pledge unequivocal support for Labour party proposals for a minimum equivalent, at today's rates, of Â£3.40 an hour. This is in spite of reservations from some craft unions, nota- bly the AEU engineering union, about the implications such a minimum rate would have for differentials between their members and other groups of workers. A recent survey by National Opinion Polls for the TUC indi- cated that 85 per cent of the electorate support the idea. But a number of questions hang over the implementation of the policy and how far it will go towards reducing poverty. Mr Michael Howard, employ- ment secretary, said up to 2m jobs would be lost as employ- ean cut thefr O*Wkorcis u a nMsequence ofi the 'mifilini wage and red:o dRM Vit ha sure Is widely s lu- to be an exaggeration# although independent esti- mates and indkitions Dom the US and Rance sugst that tp to 1)00 jobs cou'ld be shed. One of the latst stuIl&s of the issue, tby the Ins\" f -t Fiseal StuAdie, makes no attempt to caloulate Job se but conentrtes on gatgin the effect of natiohal i- mum wage on family lnomu. The results are strtlin. Among- those families whic would be afiected by a mini. mum wage, the families that would gain most are alreafd among the.best off - the iatns to the best.off 30 per cent would exceed those to the poor- sit 30 per cent. In total, 2m of the 5m families which would gain from a minimum wage are dual-income families, the best- off category of family, and a further 2m would be single people with no dependants. The real issue concerns incomes, not wages, for, as the institute points out, those with very low incomes are not in id employment. As a mea- sure to reduce poverty, a national minimum wage would do little on its own. It could eventually be paid for by job losses among the most vulnera- ble groups. Many alternative sugges- tions revolve around reform of the taxatioi and social security systems, with wage levels left to the marketplace. Individuals or households would be guar- anteed some form of minimum income, whatever their employment status, age or level of health, topped up by appropriate allowances. Such guaranteed minimum income schemes - which, by their very nature, are not delivered through the exercise f rights in the workplace - will never be as popular with unions as proposal for a mini- mum wage. A traditional union view could even see a guaran- teed income as a depressant on wages.",

   "text_content" : "Seware if you own prop- .erty that was once isused as a petrol sta- or dry cleaners - yuii could be sitting on a poten- tial uability. Next Aprillocal authorities in the U will begin to list properties which may be con- taminated as a result of their current or previous use. Regis- ters will include a wide range of sites from nuclear plants through to petrol stations and the local dry cleaners. Any property that could have ome contaminated with noxious substances, such as oil, heavy metals and cleaning spirits, will eventually appear on the list1 whether or not the land is actually contaminated. And once listed, the property will never be removed. The register - part of the UK's new set of \"green\" laws, the Environment Protection Act - is designed to reduce the problems and costs of dis- covering contamination during redevelopment. And it will pro- vide the basis for the first nationwide survey of poten- tially contaminated sites. It should also prevent houses, for example, being built on potentially dangerous soils, as happened in 1980 in the small town of Lekkerkerk in the Netherlands. There, 286 Developers fear the move will alarm the public and devalue properties houses were built on a former refuse tip. Unknown to the developers, the dump had been illegally used to dispose of toxic wastes which rose to the surface and made people ill. The UK government is now considering comments from the public consultation exer- cise about its proposed register before it finalises the exact nature of the list. Property owners and developers are alarmed about the broad sweep of the definitions suggested by government. But more impor- tant, they are fearful that the register will cause planning blight, public alarm and devalue properties. They have every reason to be concerned, considering the experience with similar regis- ters in Germany, Holland and Denmark. \"The net has been cast too widely. Registration in this form will raise more issues than it solves,\" says David Coates of the UK's House Builders Federation. Hanni Helps, director of the British Property Federation, says the public would assume that all property on the list is contaminated. \"And that will, obviously affect the value.\" Lenders, such as banks and building societiesstand to inherit the problem if the own- ers default on their debts. Insurers, unless they have spe- cifically excluded pollution in their policies, could also find themselves with an unexpected bill for cleaning up. Denmark has had a similar, but not identical, register since 1983. Henning Reinholdt of Gaarde, Denmark's leading industrial property agency, says it is difficult to sell prop- erty that appears on the list. \"Potential buyers are wor- ried about the high cost of decontamination. When we sell a site or a factory the contract is subject to the discovery of any polluted soil. The seller has to prove that the soil. is clean and if pollution is found then it has to be removed or the price adjusted to pay for the cleaning,\" he says. Denmark's rules on contami- nated land, as in Holland, are rigid because nearly all its drinking water comes from underground supplies. Any risk of water contamination is quickly dealt with by the authorities and the property owner could be liable to bear the cost. In Denmark, government funds are available to clean up sites, but these are limited and property owners with lightly polluted land invariably clean it up themselves if they want to change the designated land use, rather than wait for grants to become available. \"Once registered as contami- nated, many sites turn from a positive into a negative value,\" says Lars Skov Andersen, an environmental consultant with the Danish firm of Cowi Con- sult. The company advises developers on how best to develop contaminated sites. Cowi's business in this field has grown substantially since the register was set up. \"Our impression is that decontamination is taken as De mcIUnUU on 1me Uft 1110 4HcUUIIBU1UI 51155 yet another development cost. But then developers think twice about developing such land,\" says Andersen. Thinking twice, or not at all, is the cause of much of the blight that already affects the UK's so-called brown-field sites. Developers say it is diffi- cult enough developing these sites, such as old gas works, without the added problem of the property appearing on a register forever. In Denmark properties can be removed from the register once they have been cleaned up. This can, however, prove to be difficult because, as in Hol- land and Germany, there is much debate about what con- stitutes clean land.

He was born in the Manitoba prairie town of Oak Lake (population then 400) nl 1929, the year of the Great Depression. He became an apprentice far trader with the Hudson's Bay Company in the Northwest Territories where he fell in love with the environment and learned to respect the Inuit native people. At 18 he became a tempo- rary security clerk at the United Nations headquarters and then returned to Canada where he worked as an oil and minin securities analyst and, aged 23, made his first real money in a new oil company. By his 35th birthday, he had become president of the Power Corporation of Canada, one of the country's largest compa- nies. He left his business career to become sec- retary-general of the UN Con- ference on the Human Envi- ronment and later went on to become the first executive-di- rector of the United Nations Environment Programme. Thereafter, he returned to Canada to run the national oil company, Petro-Canada. Strong believes that Indus- try in general has woken up to the environmental challenge and is doing much to reduce pollution though there is a long way to go. In terms of pollution control technology and working to a national environmental plan stretching into the next cen- tury, Strong believes that the Japanese have long since sur- passed other western industri- alised countries. \"Japan is on the way to becoming an environmental superpower. It is already well advanced in the eco-industrial revolution. The Japanese see the importance of the environ- ment in economic terms. They are product-oriented and are changing their patterns of pro- duction and consumption. They are well along the road of cleaner production.\" Japan, for instance, pos- sesses 80 per cent of the world's scrubbers to remove sulphur dioxide from power station emissions and reduce acid rain, he said.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Rationalisation Gives Linde a Lift",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Sj or a company which ii the wad Uleader in one of ito activities and among the top producers in other - er, Linde s surprisingly reluctant to blow its own trumpet. When the German industrial group bought, Lansing Bagnall of the UK three years ago, it became the world's biggest producer, of fork-lift trucks. It is also a prominent producer of gases, industrial plant, and refrigeration systems. None of these industries is particularly exciting. Nor do. there seem to be any obvious links between them, though the company insists there are some synergies. So what makes Linde tick? More to the point, what makes it so profitable? Based on the outskirts of Wiesbaden - the elegant capital of the state of Hesse, which also includes the much more bust- ling financial and commercial city of Frankfurt - Linde does not go out of its way to encourage publicity. \"We have a restrained style,\" admits Hans Meinhardt, 60, the chief executive. \"Firstly, we are not so big. And secondly, we want to gain attention through our performance and not through making lots of noise.\" Its record is one of steadily improving results. Turnover has doubled in the past 10 years, with an 11 per cent rise to DM6.lbn (Â£2.1bn) in 1990, and a further gain of at least 10 per cent expected for 1991. Net profits were 14 per cent higher at DM212m (Â£72.Im) last year, though the rate of increase in 1991 will be less than that of turnover because of a heavy invest- ment programme; in the second half, pre- tax profits were 5 per cent higher at DM236m, with turnover up by 13 per cent to DM3.1bn. Under Meinhardt, chief executive for 15 years, Linde has streamlined its main activities, shed peripheral businesses, and expanded in both western and eastern Europe. By the time he took on the top job at the age of 45 in 1976, the company had spread far beyond the origial activity of ice-making and reoferation equipment started by ts. founder, Carl Linde, a Meinhar d Linde was in too many areas of business. His thlnking had been strongly influenced by a three-month spell with Ratbdon, the US electronics company bd ear Boston. Tom Phillipe, then the company's president, Instlled some bqsic lessons into the young Maein- hardt, who returned to Linde with firm ideas about its future. Since Meinhardt took the wheel, Linde has sold off activities which produced around DM2bn of turnover. \"We had more thin 10 divisions. Now, we have only four.\" Among the businesses to go were machine tools, large refrigeration and air- conditioning units, diesel engines, and welding equipment. \"Linde didn't look too good then,\" Meinhardt says of the time when he became chief executive. Through being in so many areas, it had lost its way. One lesson Meinhardt learnt from Phillips was that diversified companies had to be with the leaders in whatever activities they took part. Another was that the businesses and products of such a group had to be large enough for its total size. There was no point in being in areas which took up too much management time for little reward. Today, Linde's six-man .board of direc- tors is closely involved in operations, as well as taking care of strategic planning and financial controls. \"We are a company where the management looks after the operations. We are not a conglomerate with a holding company at the top.\" Linde only wants to be in areas which are technologically challenging and which its directors can understand. Meinhardt adds that the management board must also be no bigger than if Linde was a one-business company. Thus, each board member has responsibility for a function such as development, production market- ing, or inance. Each division also has a direto presenting its interests at board lerel - \" \"We want short decison-making chan- nPleb* says Meinhardt. Between 70 and 80 per cet of the daily decisions are madeby thW: operational line managers.; The remainin 20lper cent orso, includingbig Investments and acquisitions, is for the board. The director responsible can sort out many issues himself r with the chief executive. Thus the full board only has to discuss the biggest policy moves andis not bogged down with detai or bureaucracy. Meinhardt stresses \"We are competing with companies which are only active in one sector. We have competitors which only make fork-lift trucks, or only produce gases, or only build industrial plant. And we want to be able to react just as quickly, competently, and flexibly as if we were only in one business area.\" Meinhardt sees good prospects in all of Linde's sectors. In industrial gases, for example, it is spending heavily on new plant in east Germany and Czechoslo- vakia. At Lansing, an investment pro- gramme of more than Â£50m is under way. On the industrial plant side, Linde is building a DMIbn ethylene facility for BASS, the German chemical concern, in Antwerp; this is Linde's biggest ever con- tract. In addition, the group wants to squeeze more profit from its divisions through bet- ter organisation, logistics, and rationalisa- tion. The purchase of Lansing, for exam- ple, has led to a reshaping of Linde's industrial truck manufacture between its British, German, and French factories. Because of the depth of the UK reces- sion, Lansing's reorganisation is taking place at a rough time for the domestic materials-handling market. But the revamping is on schedule and last year's turnover at Lansing of around DM560m uld be areptdl 1s1,. with a rise to well over D=o in ln9. In 1984 ths gure .hould exceed DM700m, with a um on sales of 7 per ent or more e ta, in line with th rest of the division. Last year, the materias-bdng divi- imiihrkih tI Kt ruck andh ydrau- lit machinery, accounted for Just over half of turnover. But, as other \"ctivtes like gasesand plant construction grow faster, thib proportion wll drop to around 45 per cent in a fewyears. Linde is investing some D*200m in new gas'plant'and equipment in jthe east Ger- man chemical complex of U na As the east German economy pick$ up - Mein- hardt sees signs that this is beginning - demand for industrial gpesi there should rise sharply. In the meiantine, it can sup- ply the new eastern states from its present fadlities. A further DM150m is bei invested in gas plant in Czechoslova Thus, while industrial gases now accoupt for 20 per cent of turnover, they should move up to 24 per cent, with process plat (now 16 per cent) and refrigeration (13 per cent) also Improving their shares. In all four of its sectors, Linde .faces tough competition. The Japanese are its toughest most spirited rivals in fork-lift trucks, though it is also up against US and European producers. In refrigeration, there are numerous European competitors. Since industrial gases are too awkward to export, this market tends to be divided regionally. But the big European produc- ers have pushed strongly into Germany. Thus in all its activities, management agility will be at a premumi Linde is also alert for opportunities in the US, where its representation is weak and where the Jap- anese have over-run the industrial truck market. Self-effacing or not, Linde will cer- tainly have to be aggressive in coming years. Un laces toughn compeiors in or im utrucKs om mne Japanese -Â· Â· Â·- Â·",

J Longhurst in Accoun- tancy (UK), Apr 91 (2 pages) Sets out the attributes of design which make a good annual report: reading encour- aged, ease of information access, key messages con- veyed. Examines the growth of design companies geared to produce improved presenta- tion, and specified some recent successes. Simulating ownership for line managers. QB Stewart in Jour- nal of: Applied Corporate Finance (US), Autumn 90, (9 pages) Considers the use of ecom- omic value-added as a perfor- mance measure to encourage managers to become \"owners\" and to compensate them for their efforts. Shows how EVA can be used as an incentive to improve performance through the use of two case studies at Coca-Cola and Applied Power (hydraulic/sensor technology). Details how such a scheme should be separated from the budgetary and strategic plan- ning process and how it can be fnanced. Strategic transformation: the success of high-technology companies. E B Roberts in International Journal of Tech- nology Management (Switzer- land). Special publication 1991 (22 pages) From a study of successful high technology companies in the greater Boston area of the US, attempts to identify the strategic actions needed to go on from some degree of success to the realm of super-success - to go, beyond \"better\" and become \"the best\". Concludes that a market-ori- ented strategic transformation is crucial to super-success. Changes in employee share scheme law. D Cohen in the Law Society Gazette (UK). March 91 (2 pages) Reviews the changes in the funding of employee share ownership plans (Esops) and the newer employer share own- ership trusts (Esots) brought about by the Companies Act (1989) and the Finance Acts of 1989 and 1990. Competitive advantages in manufacturing through IT. JD Goldhar and others in Interna- tional Journal of Technology Management (Switzerland). Special publication 1991 (19 pages) Examines the dominant trends that characterise today's business environment - such as shortened product life cycles, fragmented markets and more rigorous quality standards - which militate against mass production strate- gies and demand more flexible production methods which can be provided by flexible automa- tion and computer-integrated manufacturing. The Rolls-Royce experience. K Janes in Logistics Today (UK), Jan/Feb 1991 (2 pages) Briefly outlines the steps taken by Rolls-Royce to intro. duce the total quality concept to its management and staff. Emphasises the \"top-down\" approach; explains the use of a steering committee to launch the concept and how various other agents were used as it permeated through the organi- sation. Concludes that total quality is a journey rather than a destination. Restructuring is a continuous process. J F Bandrowski in Long Range Planning (UK)0, Feb 91 (5 pages) Explains why companies choose to restructure by con- centrating on the core business and divesting those parts of the organisation that no longer fit with a new vision which is planned rather than being a short-notice, knee-jerk reac- tion. Cites reasons for restruct- uring and presents a five stage restructuring process for a multi-division company to undertake: profiling the busi- ness, developing a vision, determining the major moves, and rejuvenating, divesting and acquiring. Changing the company cul- ture. E H Burack in Long Range Planning (UK), Feb 91 (8 pages) Looks at the issues of corpo- rate culture, defining what cul- tures and sub-cultures are and how instigating cultural change can be difficult (case studies provide examples). Warns that attempts to change the culture often fail because of poor understanding and over-reliance on quick-fix solu- tions, or a failure to deal with such problems as the leader- ship of the business or staffing matters. Insists that changing the corporate culture can be of value; stresses the role of human resource development programmes. Characteristics and practices of \"Christian-based\" compa- nies. N Ibrahim & others in Journal of Business Ethics (Netherlands), Feb 91 (10 pages) Describes a study carried out to assess the characteristics and culture of \"Christian\" companies (described as firms which operate on a combina- tion of business and religious values). Focuses on four major relationships these companies have with employees, custom- ers, the community, and sup- pliers. Finds, among other things, that such companies engage in on-site religious practices, play music on com- pany premises and invite cli- ents and suppliers to pray. Unleashing a plant revitalisa- tion.

Car designers, says Sacco, are \"applied futur- ologists.\" The trick is to produce shapes that will live long and well in the public consciousness.

The first news of the eason was bad: Channel 4 has decided not to commission any more of After Dark, the late night, open endedsere which, wbeh It first appeared 'iJthis, country in 1987 (copiedfroim an Austrian programme) achieved the seemingly impossible. It proved that there aus sope- thing new you could do with the studio discussion - make. it intimate, long, and, Cra- cially, live - and that when you did so, talk on television could once again be fascidat- ing, significant, and even dan- gerous. It could also be long winded and embarrassing, as when Oliver Reed was allowed to indulge his boorishness for far too long. I understand that the reason for the axing offered to the independent producers is that Channel 4, under the terms of its famous \"remit\", cannot stop being innovative and must therefore find space for a fresh round of innovation. This is an interesting but highly suspect argument because whereas After Dark is different from everything else, Brookside and ,by th need vatotyw nuove of the year, C4 has announced it the rights tq h (i lste 'proxmote the sae-f l ts own , entob sas the sense to Sh Dark ( h an-. nel BC2, thus siOultaeously winning the gratude o the viewers, brownie points frko his superiors, and another chunk of independent produc tion'to, goP toathO BBCa 25' per cent quota. - Meanwhile the new season has already begun n lsome places.

Their new series,* The House of Es ot, if not a cone, looks like a close rela- tive. As with pop records which attempt to repeat a suc- cess by reproducing s nearly as possible the characteristics of the previous chart topper, so here we have many of the same essential ingredients as before. True UD was set in a household belonging to a. minor aristocrat whereas the,\" Eliotts are merely middle class, but both families are clearly genteel. True, too, The Eliotts is set in the 1920s whereas UD began before the first world war, yet it stretched on into the 1920s. Most important of all, both are which revel in the artefacts of the age of empire: boaters, :,boneshakers, and third class ralway carrlagw.It looks sus- ig on atavism. None of which is to suggest that this wll be an unsuccess- ful dramia Mid-eyvnntg on a Saturday, the story,of two sis- ters, left in fifia al difiicul- ties by their late womanising father, will probably achieve Sbig ratings. But while Atkins ndt dMarsh had personal tea- -son* for creting - Upstairs Downmstairs (both.had parents wi6i bhad been in service) The zEUotts simply looks like a ; shrewd effort to exploit a known formula. , Ah elderly woman in the opening episode was playedby.. Jean Anderson who, inciden tally, was required to remark of a girl whose father was in trade that he was \"A bit below the pale\" which makes a change from being beyond the salt. Miss Anderson will be remembered by many as the matriarch in The Brothers, BBCl's drama series in 1972, produced by Gerard Glaister. He brought new interest to what would otherwise have been a fairly routine yarn of amours, family politics, and money by setting it against an unpuiri bulsness' -16 -And mere fx-4conunday evening eb.usinesi wa be; qt.. fTiK& seeason Glaister has troeubis busio inasm w usamea bttt, tR'Yoru, D kegllumand t is e Dt an he signs of ovr b een written by somebody fn th a passionate desire to use the drama to con- vey their unigue perception of the human condition, and it showed no promise of teeingu you anything you did not already know about the way eople beve.

Much the most interesting series so far in the new season, however, has been BBC2's The Last Days Of Lenfngrud which, in each ofits slots, i pairing a fairly substantial documentary with an edition of 600 Seconds; an opinionated 10-milnute cur- rent affairs programme, origi- nated in Leningrad, which has become famous all over Russia. The great value of the BBC2 series is that it serves as a brake on any euphoria one might have felt about events in the Soviet Union. For anyone who thought from the news progammes that we were wit- nessing the triumph of the spirit of enlightenment, these documentaries will come as a \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (top) and The House of Elliot (right) .b icket of cold water. Listening to the people in Leinad yo realise it is not a question of \"Onwards and upwards to democracy\" but \"Give us back. or glorious two-headed agle\", net progression but retrogres-, sion. There is little vWidence hbre of a desire to moe for-'. wards to a modern state but many hints of a longing for old certainties. Even Nevzorov, the young journalist who has man- aged to establish 600 Seconds as his personal pulpit, turns out to be a a KGB-loving reac- tionary who declares that he does not understand democ- racy. He tells his viewers that the accounts of deaths in the Baltic republics under the tracks of Russian tanks are fairy stories. Out in the streets fierce old ladies tell the cam- eras that in Stalin's time the shops were stocked and Russia was a top nation. It all sounds remarkably like nostalgia bor- dering on atavism.

   "text_content" : "LYI1C STU1 lO, HIAMNRI i H M Stephen Jeffreys' adaptation of Hard Times is a workmanlike condensation of Dickens which was first performed in 1982 and stands as a compact little monument to its time. Commis- .ioned by Cumbria's Pocket Theatre,at a time when the RSC's Nitholas Nickleby had miade the Victorian novel into big box office, it picked up a trend that had been pioneered during the 1970s by companies such as Mike Alfreds' Shared Experience. While the taste of the time was for extrava- gant epics (eight hours in the case of Nicholas Nickleby), Jeffreys - who had served his apprenticeship in the impoverished regional sec- tor - shrewdly opted for a chamber version, refining the novel down to a two-and-a-half hour piece for four actors and a dozen or so costumes, most of these only glancingly represented by a lace fichu, a gaudy waistcoat or a hurriedly draped shawl. The result is ideal for the small companies working in small venues that have continued to keep the royalties flowing Jeffreys' way ever since, and which finally brought it to the notice of the GCSE examiners. It arrives somewhat wearily at the Lyric, Hammersmith, at the end of a lengthy tour by the cheekily named Not the National Theatre, an actor-led ensemble founded in 1964. The combination of play and performers pro- vides the sort of evening that is food and drink to the literate theatregoer, if not exactly cham- pagne and caviar. Under Giles Block's solid but unfizzy direction, the inhabitants of Coketown emerge a little mustily at flrst, although Jef- freys is an accomplished enough story-teller to carry them through early longueurs. Here, in the performance of the evening from Jeffrey Perry, is the joyless schoolmaster Grad- grind - butt of Dickens' anti-utilitarian sermon - and his maudlin, gamester son; here, from a purse-mouthed Dierdre Edwards, is Gradgrind's long-suffering daughter, Louisa, the very essence of filial repression. Alaair Mufr Leonard Kavanagh and Lilian Evans But Leonard Kavanagh gives an oddly listless performance as the self-promoting Bounderby, elderly industrialist husband to Louisa, and the treacherous Harthouse, who attempts to seduce her. Lilian Evans, pertly convincing as the circus-girl. Sissy, lacks the starchy venom of the vile Mrs Sparsit. It is all very competent, but one looks in vain for the imaginative exuberance, the cutting edge of caricature that has distinguished the best interpreters of Dickens, from Boz to Emlyn William.

There has never been eal of activity in the other direc- the Orchestre de Paris does e ore visits than it used to. This week the orchestra came over for a pair of Promenade concerts. I heard the rst on the radio on Sunday and found it very disappointing. The lack of rhythmic fibre in the accompaniment to Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto was so debilitating that it was difficult to see how any prog- ress could be made against it by the solo- ist, Philippe Bianconi. His clear-headed playing presupposed a quite different kind of performance. Nor did the main work of the evening, Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony, carry any more eclat. Semyon Bychkov, the orchestra's Music Director, kept the sym- phony from drifting into self-indulgently slow speeds, but the playing was still slug- gish. There was no comparison with the thrilling performance by Jansons and The Philharmonia earlier in the year. Assuming the possibility of a poor relay, I attended Monday's Prom in the hall. There the orchestra's sound could unques- tionably be, heard to be thick and ungainly, a legacy perhaps of its time under Daniel Barenboim. The strings hang a heavy curtain across the orchestral spread through which other instruments, save for the braying horns, find it difficult to penetrate. They play with cellos in the middle and violas to the right, the same arrangement as the Czech Philharmonic used in Edinburgh last week, though to the opposite effect: the Czechs made every- thing crystal clear, while the Parisians leave us hearing less than usual. These problems notwithstanding, Bychkov aims to get his orchestra to play with virtuosity. Kodaly's Dances of Gal- data opened the second concert with rac- ing speeds to get the adrenalin going. His performance of Strauss's Also sprchd Zarathustra later in the evening was less showy than expected, but again the music sounded unpleasantly congested. The Royal Albert Hall has had some of its acoustic flying saucers removed this year and there is a longer echo to deal with; but no other orchestra has suffered from it as badly as this. The Orchestre de Paris's ensemble is simply not sharp enough. The item of value in this second evening was the Second Symphony of Dutilleux, written in 1959. The music, even at its most derivative, is always alive with inter- est. Dutilleux inherited the native French gift for conjuring exotic sounds from an orchestra and this work is full of allure, even when the composer seems intent on telling us how much he loves The Rite of Spring. Bychkov and his players gave it a convincing symphonic thrust, though not the pointilliste precision of colours that it demands. That would seem to be outside the orchestra's powers in its present state. Richard Fairman"

   "text_content" : "ONNII SCOTT'S Somehow Ronnie has managed to squeeze Sun Ra and his eleven piece Arkestra into his Frith Street club for the week - much to the bewilderment of passing trade. Bringing much the same line-up as was seen at Brecon last year, with the addition of a mighty African drum, 77-year-old Ra himself appeared terribly frail on Monday night He had to be helped into place by two bearers and fixed, deadpan at the key- boards in his twinkling gold Lurex robes. The Arkestra's space cadets, dressed as astral pearly kings, had moved into posi- tion earlier and set up an ominous rum- bling of percussion and trumpet fanfare which, with the arrival of their master, slid into a severely wonky Ra anthem, \"Love in Outer Space\". \"A celestial refrain,\" as the lyric goes, which is sung smilingly and endearingly without time by violinist June Tyson alongside a swaying brass section. The heartwarming big band singalong has been played innumerable times by the Arkestra and still it is delivered with the fervour and genuine eccentricity of a cult sect meeting after a lengthy break. The component parts of the Arkestra's music are more or less straightforward, comprising overtones from Ellington big band sounds through Monk-style bebop to freeform. The difference is, he is an origi- nal - he has pioneered the use of synths in jazz - and he can stir all this music together, with much percussion, in one glorious Technicolor set. This night Ra stuck with his own chant- able material, \"Sunset on the Nile\". for example, with its searing solos passed down from trumpets to sax to flute. He entered the free zone with some rip roar- ing improvisation from altoist Marshall Allen and, at last, the churning tenor of John Gilmore, an Arkestra acolyte for 40 years. After an attacking trombone solo from Tyrone Hill and Tyson's smoking vio- lin, the entire ensemble, Ra aside, went walkabout between the tables, their energy uncontainable. Sun Ra, silent throughout and even more solemn than usual behind his sun- glasses, scribbled the while on keyboards, eventually reining in the itinerants with his melancholic theme, \"Space is the Place...outer space is a pleasant place.\" Garry Booth",

   "text_content" : "WHEN the Polish government bravely set about the radical path to economic reform in 1990, it set high standards for the rest of eastern Europe. Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister, and one of the chief architects of Poland's reforms, embarked on a pro- gramme aimed at bringing down inflation, reducing the budget deficit, and making the zloty a stable currency. His uncompromising stance earned praise from the international community. But as unemploy- ment rose to 8.4 per cent of the labour force and, in the first five months of the year, gross domestic product fell by 14.9 per cent, the resolve of the Pol- ish government was tested. This is understandable. Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime minister, faces the electorate next month. The recession cannot be attributed solely to Mr Balcer- owicz, or his prime minister. The main problems have been the rigidities of the old Polish economy and the slow pace of structural reform. That slow pace has been partly a result of the political constraints on more decisive action. Last autumn's presidential election campaign, which was won by Mr Lech Walesa, inter- rupted the reform process. Also, by agreement with the former regime, the government is saddled with a parliament not democratically elected and still dominated by communists. To its credit, the Sejm has worked at top speed to enact financial and economic mea- sures consistent with Euro- pean Community practice. But in failing to seize the opportu- nity last May for holding free parliamentary elections, the government was deprived of a mandate to consolidate the reforms. Pressure to soften pol- icy in the run-up to the elec- tions will be great. Lax discipline It is this lack of legitimacy which has slowed the pace of privatisation and structural reforms. Regulations concern- ing foreign investment have still to be settled. Discipline in the banking system is lax, as witnessed by one conspicuous scandal. Controls on lending to insolvent enterprises are few; the quality of loan decisions to state enterprises is inadequate. These hangovers from the old centralised system are delay- tng sustained economic recov- ery. The external climate has also been unkind. The continu- ing reluctance by the EC to lift trade barriers, particularly for agricultural products and tex- tiles has hindered the expan- sion of exports. Despite some success, Poland will end this year with a trade deficit of over $lbn. Furthermore, the switch to the dollar, clearing system between eastern Europe and the Soviet Union led to a sharp fall in contracts and profits for Polish enter- prises. Taken together, these factors explain why the budget deficit has risen from 0.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GDP over the past eight months. Unpopular decisions The prime minister is in a bind. On the one hand, he wants to reassure western financial institutions that he will persevere with the reforms. This will mean mak- ing unpopular decisions about reducing the deficit before the elections. On the other, Seim deputies also face the elector- ate and are reluctant to agree cuts in public expenditure. This deadlock has prompted Mr Bielecki to seek constitu- tional amendments enabling the executive to bypass parlia- ment. If accepted, this proposal would set a precedent in which accountability invested in any future democratically-elected parliament could be weakened. Mr Walesa and his prime minister are taking these steps because they fear that an elec- toral law based on proportional representation will lead to a proliferation of parties and hence to political instability. The need to strengthen the executive is as much a response to the fears of dealing with an unwieldly parliament, as to fear about the economy. Poland does need a strong executive to deal with the problems it faces, but it also needs parliamentary account- ability. A balance will have to be struck. But, for now, the government must not panic. Mr Bielecki's government must persist with a sound financial policy, since this remains the only viable path towards a suc- cessful and competitive Polish economy.",

   "text_content" : "TODAY'S TUC debate, entitled i collective bargaining strategy i for the 1990s, is sure to gener- j ate much heat. Regrettably it 1 will throw little light on what i is a central challenge for UK ( economic policy. The delegates will debate a contradictory ( motion that suggests a need for j co-ordinated pay bargaining, t without specifying what this ( actually means or why it is 8 important. The reason, of I course, is that union behaviour t is part of the problem. c It is, in fact, much easier to f diagnose the UK pay problem than to prescribe a cure. The i age-old problem of excessive wage inflation has persisted through the 1980s; greater i decentralisation has not helped. In that decade, the annual rate of wage inflation in manufacturing remained * above 6.9 per cent, despite C record unemployment. Once unemployment started i falling in 1986, and as skill shortages developed, unions pressed for higher wages while companies were happy to out- bid their competitors. The result of this leap frogging was a rise in wage and then price inflation. Companies raised I their prices to protect profit margins, while UK unit cost growth outstripped the Euro- pean competition. The rest is painfully recent history. Membership of the exchange 4 rate mechanism only makes ' the cost of this collective irra- tionaltty more immediate. With I sterling fxed in the ERM, UK unit %abour costs cannot 1 exceed those of the competition without further reducing the competitivene of the coun- I try's exports. UK wage settle- ments must therefore fa ton annual rate of between 4and 5 per cent. After for quarters of I receai n they have still not < dlen far eaogh.

Furthermore, coordination must be combined with decen- tralisation so that wage differ- entials reflect local market conditions. What form might this coor- dination take? First, employers and unions should accept that the style of pre-ERM wage bar- gaining, with pay deals based around a backward-looking measure of retail price infla- tion, is no longer feasible. The correct inflation rate to bar- gain around is the lowest expected average rate of wage inflation in the ERM. Shorter round This forward-looking esti- mate would ideally be made by a new and independent fore- casting body, a council of eco- nomic advisers, before the autumn wage round. The incentive for companies not to leap-frog would be further enhanced if the annual wage round were compressed into a much shorter period. This is about as far as pay coordination in Britain should go. Centrallaed bargaining-type meetings between employers and union leaders m as unde- sirable as they are, in the near future, unlikely. Even more damaging would be so-called deals between employers or unions and the government, whereby the latter promises increases in nomnal or real incomes, or other social bene- fits, but only in return for wage restraint.

Given the unpredictable pace of change on the international scene; it might have been rea- sonable for critics to overlook a temporary error of judgment. What makes the Mitterrand episode so interesting is that, like a tropical storm, it has continued to roll round and round the French political. fir, mament, rumbling ominously and casting an ever darker shadow. Part of the explanation, of course, is seasonal. When the Soviet putsch story broke, France was on holiday, and it is only now that the heavy hit- ters in politics and the media are returning to the world of work. Moreover, the seaside conferences of the main politi- cal parties, which peaked early this week, have been providing excellent platforms for pump- ing up the controversy. But it is beginning to look as if the Mitterrand episode may have been more than an epi- sode. In the Soviet Union, the consequences of the failed coup have been far greater than any- one could have predicted two weeks ago; by the same token, its international ramifications, and its impact on French poli- tics, may also be more far-reaching. If the tropical storm is still rumbling around the French political firmament it is because the tropical storm is still rumbling around the international firmament. As so often, the most pene- trating analysis of the situa- tion has come from Mr Serge July, the brilliant editor of the newspaper Libdration. The deep problem, he suggests, is not that President Mitterrand is old or enfeebled, but that his natural rhythm of political action is out of kilter with the pace of events. Throughout his political life, Mr Mitterrand has repeatedly proved his mas- tery as a strategist. But that mastery has been demon- strated in the long rhythms of a marathon runner; whereas today's unstable world requires much quicker responses. One of Mr Mitterrand's most often quoted maxims is: \"Ii faut donner du temps au temps.\" [We must let time do its work]. He put it in practice on the domestic political front with his 10-year strategy through the 1970s for embrac- ing and then stifling the French Communist party; this made the Socialist party the biggest party in France, and then gave him the presidency in 1981. He is still putting his strategy in practice abroad, with his long-term programme for leading the European Com- munity along a quasi-federalist road. President Mitterrand's talent for playing long worked spec- tacularly to his advantage three years ago, when he com- prehensively outmanoeuvred his right-wing rivals in the ~S~Â·~i~4~~ presidential elections of 1988. But since 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world has moved too fast for him. Throughout the past two years, Mr Mitterrand has put on a display of serenity; but he has repeatedly revealed that he really wanted to slow down the kaleidoscope of change, whether it was the unification of Germany or the rise of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian repub- lic. This underlying pattern was obscured earlier this year, because President Mitterrand was able to give a virtuoso per- formance of his slow strategy during the long six-month build-up to the Gulf war. Not The deep problem is not that President Mitterrand is old or enfeebled, bunt that his natural rhythm of political action is out of kilter with the pace of events merely did he soar to new (if temporary) heights of public popularity, but he reduced vir- tually all his political oppo- nents to loyal acquiescence. They are now taking their revenge, by attacking him in the inner sanctum of his for- eign policy; and they are also drawing a sweeping domestic conclusion from the aftermath of events in the Soviet Union: Socialism, they smile, is dead. From such people such a conclusion is obviously wishful thinking. But there is little doubt that the upheavals in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe are creating large addi- tional complications for Presi- dent Mitterrand's strategies at home and in Europe. At home, President Mitter- rand has long pursued a strat- egy of a de facto union of the left, in which the reduced Com- munist party could be relied on to support the Socialists in par- liament. Mr Michel Rocard, the former prime minister, tried to build ad hoc coalitions in the centre, but his replacement in May by the more left-wing Mrs Edith Cresson looked like an attempt to breathe new life into the old alliance. And yet this old alliance was already beginning to suffer from fatal weaknesses. The shrinking Communist party is already fast losing any plausi- ble future as a parliamentary prop; Mr Mitterrand had no intention of gratifying it in pol- icy terms; and there is little evidence that a leftward swing would be an election-winning recipe. These weaknesses can only be magnified by the col- lapse of the Communist party in the Soviet Union. Mr Mitterrand may be a life- long anti-Communist, but he has no electoral interest in the disappearance of tIhe French Communist party; for in the last analysis, a reduced Com- munist party in France can hope for nothing except an alli- ance with the Socialists. His histinctive preference would be a slower pace of change; but that option seems to be evapor- ating fast. In Europe, President Mitter- rand's strategy for securing far-reaching new treaties on political and economic union this year can only be compli- cated by the dislocation of the existing order in Europe. In logic, the disintegration of the Soviet Union should reinforce the case for a more united Community; but in the short term it could become a pretext for opponents of the Commu- nity model who would use the example of the breaking up of the Soviet empire as an argu- ment against moves towards federalism in Europe. But it is at home that Presi- dent Mitterrand's dilemma is most acute. Since the spring, it has looked increasingly proba- ble that the Socialists would be comprehensively defeated in the next general elections in 1993; an opinion poll in May suggested that the traditional conservative parties would win a sweeping majority of seats, without having to depend on the extreme right-wing National Front. If the appointment in the same month of the raucous Mrs Cresson was intended to reverse the trend, it backfired badly; almost immediately, her standing in the polls plunged steeply, and she has taken President Mitterrand down in her wake. Speculation now suggests that President Mitterrand might dump Mrs Cresson, and call on Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to replace her. Even if Mr Delors failed to avert defeat in the elections, he would have made a dignified re-entry to French politics and would be poised as a plausible Socialist candidate for the pres- idential elections of 1995. Such a stratagem would have a double logic. First, Mr Delors is largely untainted by the bitter factional rivalries inside the Socialist party, and might be able to pose as a uni- fying compromise candidate. Second, the mobilisation of a unifying candidate would have the immense commendation for President Mitterrand of keeping out Mr Michel Rocard, who has long stalked the suc- cession to Mr Mitterrand. The polls suggest that Mr Rocard would have the strongest chance of winning the election, but his victory would be gall- ing to Mr Mitterrand. Only one word is now miss- ing from these plans and strat- agems, and that is the word socialism. President Mitterrand evidently did not care for Mr Rocard's social democracy, which avoided any ideological dogmatism; and yet the Elysde Palace now feels compelled to damp down the crude left-win- gery of Mrs Cresson's utter- ances, which seem anachronis- tic without being popular. If the British Labour party once suffered from excessive com- mitment to old-fashioned socialism, the French Socialist party may now be suffering from the virtual absence of any clear political message. Per- haps the conservatives are right after all: perhaps social- ism is dead.",

   "text_content" : "t is not customary for the head of a nationalised monopoly to come forward with radical proposals for increasing competition in his industry. However, at first sight something like that appears to be the intention of Sr Bryan Nicholson, the Post Office chairman. Faced with government plans to erode the Post Office's monopoly on delivering all letters costing less than Â£1 by allowing private couriers to compete, Sir Bryan says he embraces the idea of liberalisa- tion, and is putting forward his own ideas for change. In one sense he has no choice but to endorse his sole shareholder's aims. But Sir Bryan has reasons of his own for advocating more competi- tion: he wants the Post Office to be freed from the shackles currently imposed on it by the government, so as to be better able to take on the private cou- rier companies that are keen to enter the UK mail delivery business. And - whatever the government intends - he wants to do it on his own terms, with minimal official regulation. \"The [letters] monopoly was always a bit of an albatross,\" he says. \"The government's proposals take us off the hook of having to stay were we are. It is difficult to change our ser- vice within a monopoly frame- work; it is much easier within an open market.\" This is not Sir Bryan's first attempt at getting the govern- ment to accept changes to the Post Office's status. Earlier in the year Mr Lilley rejected his proposal for a so-called pre- mium delivery service, guaran- teeing an early next morning delivery, which would cost about 35p an item. Residential delivery would have been stag- gered throughout the day. The government was not convinced that the implicit discrimina- tion between business and resi- dential mail would be politi- cally acceptable while the Post Office retained its overall monopoly on mail services. Mr Lilley now plans to reduce that monopoly to ser- vices costing less than 25p - just above what will soon be the price of a first class stamp - but also to regulate the industry more closely. Here is the rub. Sir Bryan thinks these proposals need much more consideration. \"It is a delicate balancing act to inject more competition while preserving a uniform national service. It can be done, but it will require a lot of work.\" He believes the Post Office could maintain its universal and uniform service nation- wide - within a competitive framework - by separating first and second class mail operations. The Post Office would retain its monopoly over letters costing less than 24p. This would be a standard pub- lic service which he claims would be better than current second class but not as good as first - and would make a profit on its own; at present, second class mail, costing 17p, is heavily subsidised by first class. A report by the consul- Sir Bryan: more competiton tants Ernst and Young, com- missioned by the Post Office, showed that this separation was feasible. The Post Office would also offer a premium service - a new first class service aimed at businesses - costing about 35p an item and guaranteeing an early next day delivery. This is a variation on Sir Bryan's ear- lier, rejected proposal - but he thinks it stands a greater chance of acceptance now that the government has decided to erode the letters monopoly. In addition, Sir Bryan is tak- ing the opportunity to try to free himself from another gov- ernment-imposed shackle: the requirement that the Post Office deliver letters twice a day. \"I can imagine the sce- nario where the public would want a different pattern of ser- vice,\" he says. \"That may mean that one delivery a day would be acceptable.\" As with other nationalised or once-nationalised companies, however, the real dispute that lies ahead is over regulation. Sir Bryan wants the Post Office to be subject to less of it, not more as envisaged by Mr Lilley. The government would strengthen supervision of the industry through the appoint- ment of a new body, Ofpost, similar to Oftel, the telecom- munications regulator. This would advise on whether each step towards competition could be undertaken without com- promising the Post Office's ability to deliver a universal service, which is likely to remain the government's main concern. The government - and natu- rally enough Sir Bryan - are anxious that private operators, such as TNT, the Australian transport group, should not be allowed simply to pick off the most lucrative business routes, leaving the Post Office to han- dle loss-making provincial ser- vices. As he sees it, the regula- tor - preferably publicly accounting for its decisions rather than operating in secret as Oftel does - will play a crucial role here. Mr Lilley has received a monthly briefing from Sir Bryan on how the corporation is adapting to the proposed changes since they were pub- lished as part of the Citizen's Charter in July. Both men are intent on change, but Sir Bryan Is preparing for intense bargaining on how to imple- . ment it.",

   "text_content" : "rom Mr David Purchase. Sir, I was interested in your report (August 30) from the British Association meeting on the plea from Professor Bob Williamson to ban discrimina- tion by life insurance compa- nies based on the results of genetic testing. This is yet another example of the current trend to argue that, if no \"fault\" is involved, then social pressures against discrimina- tion outweigh normal scientifl- cally-based judgments. Atti- tudes to HIV testing are, of course, the most topical and critical example. The social pressures are real and understandable. However, if you ban such discrimination by life companies, how do you also control discrimination against them by those who do actually know that they are at higher risk? If the average sum insured is Â£50,000 but those at higher risk insure themselves for Â£250,000, the \"community\" - here the remaining policy- holders - are paying not only for the higher risk but paying for it fivefold. A limit on cover is not the answer, as those at greater risk could easily insure themselves with far more companies than the norm. Whenever there is a choice on the part of the indi- vidual seeking cover, insurers must remain free to exercise their own judgments. Professor Gordon Dunstan is surely right to say that, if society then wishes certain adverse conse- quences to be avoided, society itself should pay the bill.

   "text_content" : "rT he iqternatioial tele- S.phone cartel, which is jp.V mesoible' for interna- average two to four times coSisgearing up for reform. The Iternatioal Telephone anqd .Telegraph Consultative C6niiittee (CCIT), based in Geneva, is meeting tomorrow andfddy to discuss changes to ihef'complicated accounting rate system which is blamed for the high level of prices. It is estimated that telephone users across the world are being overcharged by $10bn-$2Obn a year., The meeting is likely to be a milestone on the path to lower prices because there now seems to be a general mood in favour of reform. But a defini- tive agreement on changes may have to wait until the con- sequences of specific reform proposals have been analysed. The accounting rate system grew up in the first half of the century because of the monop- oly structure of the telecommu- nications industry. National telephone companies, typically state-owned, were not (and are still generally not) allowed to operate in other countries and so had to use their counter- parts abroad to deliver calls to their destination. Some means of compensa- ting the foreign phone compa- nies for their work had to be devised. The accounting rate system, which operates under the CCITT's auspices, is the main one. An accounting rate - set bilaterally between countries - determines how much each company pays the other for delivering every minute of tele- communications traffic. Phone companies settle on the basis of the net traffic between their countries. In some cases, the payments are large. For exam- ple, US telephone companies paid Germany's Deutsche Tele- kom $167m net in 1989. Theoretically, the rates are based on costs. But in fact they are determined by bargaining. The phone company receiving payment has an incentive to keep accounting rates high because that maximises the amount of money it is paid. Therefore, although costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, rates have stayed high. The high level of accounting rates has provided a floor beneath which the phone com- panies have been unable to cut the prices they charge custom- ers. Reforming the system has not been easy because the countries which are net benefi- ciaries have a vested interest in its continuation. However, over the past year, those countries which are net losers have been stepping up pressure for its reform. The \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t US, which paid out $3bn last year, is leading the campaign. Australia, Canada, Sweden and New Zealand, which face sub- stantial deficits, have also been advocating changes. Momentum for change has been boosted by the fact that the CCIIT is no longer acting in a vacuum. The European Commission's competition authorities have launched an investigation into accounting rates and call charges, and the US Federal Communications Commission has threatened to cut accounting rates unilater- ally in 1993 if they have not fallen far enough by then. Meanwhile, there have been economic reports arguing that high call charges restrain world trade and could be harm- ing the interests of the phone companies by curtailing the use of international telecoms. The argument at this week's meeting of CCITT Study Group 3 is likely to be less about whether accounting rates need to come down than about how to achieve this. There are four main proposals for reducing accounting rates. * Lower accounting rates should be negotiated but the system itself should not be changed. Mr Bernard Rouxev- ile, a France Telecom execu- tive who is also chairman of CCITT study group 3, says there is no need for radical change: \"By 1993-94 most of the problems raised a few years ago will be solved. Accounting rates will be close to costs.\" The move to lower account- ing rates has certainly acceler- ated over the past year. US car- riers, led by the largest - AT&T - have negotiated phased reductions in account- ing rates of 50 per cent or more with the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. European phone companies have also agreed to cut intra- European rates by about half. But experts such as Mr Tom Luciano, who is responsible for accounting rate negotiations at AT&T, argue that rates are still generally far above costs - while costs continue to fall. * The CCITT should set maxi- mum levels for accounting rates. Sweden has suggested that for calls up to 3,000 km in length there should be a top rate of 0.6 special drawing rights (SDR) - the IMF inter- national currency unit - per *ut\", riing to SDR 1.0 for himieft lgur on iccn ntlUm rates are not pubilshed except by the US but some are under- stood to be as high as SDR 5.0 This proposal as been crit- icised by the US anl the UK on the grounds that price caps often end up being norms and that the rates suggested by Sweden are still above cst Mr Bertil Tborngren, dirctor of corporate piianinl at Tdv- erket, Sweden's telecommuni- cations operator, freely admits this but argues that the figures uroposed would still in many ases be below the rates now in force. * CCITT recommendations should be changed to contain a dear statement that account- ing rates should be based on costs, that the rates should be published and that phone com- pniat should not discriminate etween different countries. The US, which is pushing this line, believes that, so long as accounting rates are kept secret, it is difficult to know whether they are based on costs or not. It is also difficult to determine whether a phone company is being unfairly treated. The US argues that publication would lead to downward pressure on rates, because a phone company would.be able to argue that its counterpart was giving other phone companies a better deal. * The system should be abol- ished. Although this is not on the agenda at the CCITI, this line is being advocated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The idea is that the account- ing rate system should be replaced with a new system of \"termination fees\". Every phone company would publish one as the price at which it would agree to deliver calls to their final destination. This fee would be the same no matter where the call came from and would be no higher than the country's most expensive long-distance call. If the CCITT moves to bring accounting rates nearer to costs, that will be only part of the story. Lower accounting rates would remove a barrier to cutting the prices customers pay but that is not the same thing as giving the companies an incentive to cut their prices. The surest way of providing that incentive would be for governments to allow competi- tion in international telecom- munications. Dismantling the industry's monopoly structure would also remove the ratio- nale for the accounting rate system, because phone compa- nies would then be able to pro- vide customers with competing end-to-end services. Most gov- ernments, however, have yet to bite that bullet. I l il I1 I",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "From Mr Perry Aldred. Sir, There is no need for \"forecasters to fly blind\" (Leader, August 31) if they can find a lodestar. Anthony Harris was on the track of one when he wrote \"Avoiding the crunch questions about credit\" in his column on April 2. Here he referred to the number of deci- sions in UK banks which were being made on the basis of the effect they would have on the career paths of the bankers involved rather than for com- mercial or economic consider- ations. The same is true in the US, where similar decisions made for career reasons can create actual changes in the flow of funds within the US economy, some of which tend to be overlooked. What tends to happen in the US after a year suchas 1990 is that US banks will have spent the first quarter of 1991 identi- bying and reserving for prob lem loans, and the second avoiding surprises and hoping for stability. Given the compet. itive pressures the 12,000 US banks cause - where pausing for breath is not ae b - the current quarter, third, is seeing the start of new led- ing in the US as banks strive to create fresh loan books. There is a similar process at work in the UK, but iven the half-yearly reporting Cyle here and the -mmo dimng epe- rience, starting at the same time as its US counterpart, January 11, a UK bank will only be raisim ts hda above the parapet and making new loans, not in the third quarter but in the third half-year. this will start in January 19M2. The Yasada Trust Europe Outlook predicted for this reason that there would be economic recovery in the US in the third quarter of 1991. Using the same logic, the Outlook forecast the UK recovery to come through at the beginning of 192. There has been no reason to change these forecasts made at the beginning of January this year. Given the various linkages which there are in place through the ownership ofmul- tinationals, through the whole- sale money markets and the forex markets, the UK econ- omy is much more dependent upon that of the US than is generally believed, with a lag here of six to nine months because of the more sequent reporting periods in the US. This is a view formed by observing the US economy emere from successiave reces sions. It has also been formed by making comparisons between the behaviour pat- terns of US managers over a number of years as they have reacted to the extraordinary pressures which quarterly reporting causes in an open society sach as the US and the decisions taken in a more relaed timeutable in the lss umery Alred, Yom.a 2sht Sb n UL 4^2Ci~r",

   "text_content" : "The peoples of both Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union face acute problems of self-determination. Minority rights are the key AFFAIRS The chances do not seem good. Practically all the ingre- dients of the Yugoslav tragedy are reproduced in the Soviet Union, only on a much larger scale and with even greater complexity. Both were federal states, on paper rather loosely constructed, but held together by a single Communist party which held power in all the constituent republics. In both, the republics were identified with different \"nationalities\", but their territory corre- sponded only very roughly to the area inhabited by people of that nationality. In both cases the largest nationality (Rus- sian and Serb respectively) was present in large numbers on the territories of most of the other republics, and was seen by the other nationalities as dominant; yet its own mem- bers tended to see themselves as the main victims. In both there were lesser nationalities without republics of their own, but enjoying varying degrees of autonomy. In both, as com- munism broke down, the com- munist leaderships presented themselves in more and more nationalistic terms, but their success in staving off the rise of nationalist opposition move- ments varied among republics. Already several outlying areas of the Soviet Union - Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, the Ferghana Valley - have become the scene of local and apparently perma- nent ethnic wars similar to that which has affected Croatia in the last two months. But in none of these local conflicts has the Russian population been one of the main protago- nists; and, perhaps for that rea- son, the Soviet armed forces have not intervened in such a systematic and one-sided way as the Yugoslav army, which has sided with the Serbs. At the beginning of last week, Mr Boris Yeltsin did begin to sound alarmingly like the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, when he warned (or allowed his spokes- man to warn) that Russia reserved the right to negotiate new borders with any republic, 'The central question in toe net phase *of European history is: can the Soviet Union avoid the fate of 0A other than the Baltic states, which sought to leave the union. In the short term that piece of sabre-rattling seems to have paid off, since both the Ukraine and Kazakhstan - the two republics most vulnerable to Russian irredentism - after first protesting loudly, has- tened to sign agreements with Russia maintaining economic and military co-operation. But the threat has revived old fears of Russian hegemony in the other nationalities. Distrust and resentment of Russia in the non-Russian republics is understandable. It seems to them that Russia is arbitrarily and unfairly using the Russian diaspora to limit their right of self-determina- tion. Ulster unionists feel a similar resentment about the Irish Republic's pretension to interfere in Northern Ireland in defence of the Catholic minority there. Yet there are limits to the right of self-deter- mination, in practice if not in It is unwise for a majority to disregard a large minority, especially if it is supported by a powerful next-door state theory; and the most important of them is this: although the right is normally exercised by the majority of the people liv- ing in a given territory, it is very unwise and dangerous for the majority to disregard the views of a large minority, and especially so if that minority is supported by a neighbouring state larger and more powerful than the territory in question. Ulster unionists may be able to hold their own against the Republic, at any rate so long as they still have the power of Great Britain behind them. But Greek Cypriots were no match for Turkey, and the Croats look heavily outgunned by the Serbs. Let us hope that the Ukrainians remain wise enough to avoid setting them- selves on a similar collision course with the Russians. (The Kazakhs, who barely outnum- ber the Russians in their own republic but have a much higher birthrate, would be best advised to bide their time.) Letters will now pour in from outraged Croat and Ukrainian nationalists, not to mention Greek Cypriots. How can I espouse such cynical rea- poUti?. Is it not the task of the international community to resist these bullyboy tactics and uphold the inviolability of national frontiers? Should not Britain defend the right of the majority in Croatia, Ukraine and Cyprus, as it does in Northern Ireland? Well, I am bound to agree that Britain defaulted on its obligations to both communi- ties in Cyprus - a special case because Britain had guaran- teed by treaty not only the international sovereignty of the island but also its domestic constitutional order. (The Turks violated the former on the pretext of countering Greek violations of the latter. Britain did not attempt to reverse either, but contented itself with supplying peace- keeping forces to consolidate successive faits accomplis.) But it seems to me doubtful whether Croats and Ukrainians are entitled to claim any inter- national status for frontiers which were established only as administrative divisions within what were then, from an inter- national point of view, single states. Secession in itself involves the creation of new international frontiers. Both Serbs and Russians have a good point when they say that any such new frontiers should be fixed by negotiation. But that does not mean that either are entitled to try and pre-empt the issue by force: it is that attempt, in the Serbian case, which the EC is rightly strug- gling to block. Wherever frontiers are drawn there will still be minor- ities on the \"wrong\" side of them, unless they are to be eliminated by acts of genocide or mass expulsion. (Such acts disfigured European history in the recent past, but still have not arranged the peoples of Europe into ethnically homoge- neous territorial blocs.) The aim of both national and inter- national policy should be to make these minorities feel at home, so that their grievances do not serve as fuel for endless frontier conflicts. How should this be done? The necessary condition is that individual human rights should be guaranteed, espe- cially the right to travel and communicate freely across frontiers. But in many cases this will not be sufficient, and some group rights will have to be recognised as well. Minori- ties will not feel at home if they do not have access to edu- cation and information in their own language, which means they must be guaranteed a fair share of the state resources devoted to schools, universities and television, with the right to decide for themselves how those resources are used. Where a national minority is a local majority it is specially important that it should feel at home if it is not to be tempted by secession. That means that it must feel confident about its ability to remain a majority in its own area without having to change its state allegiance, something which can often only be assured by placing lim- its on individual freedom. A good example can be found in Minorities and Human Rights Law, a report issued by the London-based Minority Rights Group. The Aaland Islands in Finland maintain their Swedish charac- ter through regulations on lan- guage, education, regional citi- zenship and the acquisition of property - even to the extent that the consent of the local commune is required for a child of Finnish-speaking par- ents to be educated in Finnish. Five years' unbroken residence is required before a newcomer can acquire land or vote in regional elections. These provi- sions have their origin in one of the first decisions of the League of Nations in 1921. The League awarded the islands to Finland, and the Finns accepted this special status for their Swedish minority as the price of avoiding a destructive border dispute with Sweden. Who is to say they were wrong?",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in The Hague and Laura Sllber in Belgrade THE European Community yesterday called a peace con- ference to try to settle Yugo- slavia's worsening ethnic con- flict. It is scheduled to start this Saturday in The Hague. The Community's first attempt to settle an interna- tional crisis will be chaired by Lord Carrington, the former UK foreign secretary and Nato chief who presided over the 1979 Lancaster House negotia- tions which ended Zimbabwe's civil war. The conference follows Mon- day morning's acceptance by all the Yugoslav combatants of a ceasefire, the extension of EC monitoring to the areas of Croatia disputed between Serbs and Croats, and the dis- engagement of the contending forces. As violent Plashes continued in Croatia yesterday, Mr Hans Van den Brok, foreign minis- ter of the Netherlnd, which currently holds the presi- dency, said they underlined the urgent need for independent monitoring of the ceasefire agreement he secured at the weekend in Belgrade. At least three civilians were killed, including a 1S-year-old girl who died when her home on the outskirts of Osijek was hit by mortar fire, Four soldiers and several civilians, including three chil- dren, were killed in fighting overnight in Petrinja, 50km south of the Croatian capital Zagreb site, of the republic's blgest food proceming plant. Mr vai den Broek aid: \"There are many versions about who is responsible and this Is bound to continue with. out impartial control.\" He said a team of 200 monit6rs, from the EC and four ountries thom the 35-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, would start arriving in Zarb tomorrow. He warned that they would remain in the Croatian capital until their safety was sure. While no one would say so yes. terday, it is a precondition for the conference to go ahead that a ceasefire sufficient to reverse the escalating violence of the past month be in force by Fri- day, when the Twelve meet in Brussels. The conference was brought orward from September 16 to maintain the momentum gen- erated byMonday's agiement. The accord marked the first time that -Mr Slobodan MieO- &eic, the Serbian prsldent, ha agreed to ll.EC mediation. The three premises on whch the conference s based are: * Yugoslavia's internal bor- ders cannot be changed by force; * Rights of minorities in the republics, such as Serbs in Croatia, must be guaranteed: * \"Full account [is] to be taken of all legitimate con- cerns and legitimate aspira- tions.\" After mdorsement of these picipues it ths Hague's Peace Palace on Saturday by the Twelve and rnves of Yugosavia's momderaan repub- uican authorities, the confer- ence will break into working . The most insoluble - such as rIng tis- will go to an arbi- tration committee of leading European constitutional law- yers for binding decisions. The EC also signalled that it would restore nearly $1.Obn (2590m) in aid and credit pro- grammes to Yugoslavia \"as soon as possible\", and provide emergency assistance.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent HOPES for an early cut in British interest rates mounted yesterday as operators on the domestic money market detected less resistance to an easing of monetary conditions in Bank of England activities. The important three month interbank rate - which acts as a bellwether for UK bank base rates - fell by % percentage point to 10% per cent yester- day, thus widening the gap against current base rates of 11 per cent. According to some operators, three month money, which has fallen sharply since closing last week at 101o per cent, was quoted at one point yesterday close to 10% per cent, a level that would justify a '/ point base rate cut. Instead of acting to damp the fall in interest rates, the Bank was seen to adopt an accommo- dative stance in its money mar- ket operations. This strength- ened the feeling that a new round of interest rates cuts could be brought forward. Underpinning such hopes is a growing perception in sinan- cial markets that inflation has ceased to be Britain's main economic problem. The retail price index for August is expected to show a sharp fall in the annual rate of inflation as last year's sharp increases in petrol prices drop out of the index. September 13, when the RPI is published, has been widely tipped as a possible date for a rate cut But the government has an incentive to act sooner, if it is confident about the disinfla- tionary outlook. An early cut in interest rates would allow Mr Norman Lamont, the chan- cellor, to hold out the promise of a stronger recovery at next month's Conservative party Sterling's relatively strong recent performance has also boosted haopes of an earily rate cat The pound strengthened galst the dDar to dose in New York at $1.0145.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans WATER companies were warned yesterday that they should consider making volun- tary reductions in their pro- posed charges for next year if they wished to avoid the pros- pect of enforced cuts. Mr Ian Byatt, director gen- eral of the Office of Water Ser- vices (Ofwat), the industry's economic regulator, wrote to the managing directors of all 34 water companies in England and Wales to tell them he would decide on the 1992-93 charging levels by October 31 and they should submit any additional relevant information to him by then. A review of water company charges, which are based on the level of inflation plus a sac- tor known as K to take account of heavy investment commit- ments, is not due until 1994. However, Mr Byatt has said he will review K factors this year because of the higher than expected profits and dividends announced by the water com- panies. The letter is the latest in a series of increasingly tough warnings from Mr Byatt to the companies on their dividend and diversification policies, and was seen by company chiefs as an attempt to bully them into voluntary cuts in charges for next year. At the same time, Mr Byatt announced that stringent new regulations have been agreed with the water companies to ensure that customers are not affected adversely by any diversification from the core businesses of supplying water and sewerage services. All water companies in England and Wales have accepted proposed licence changes aimed at guaranteeing that the companies always have adequate financial and management resources for their core businesses. The amendments, which come into effect immediately, require directors of the 10 pri- vatised water and sewerage businesses and the 24 water- only companies to confirm annually to Ofwat that they have the resources to run the core services effectively. They will also be expected to consult Mr Byatt when under- taking any signiicant diversifi- cation, although this is not a formal licence requirement. The announcement confirms that the water industry faces a far tougher regulatory regime than other privatised indus- tries such as electricity, gas and telecommunications. Before privatisation in late 19M9 there was widespread con- cern at ambitious diversifica- tion plans proposed by many of the water authorities. In the event, diversification has been modest and has been targeted mainly at consultancy, engi- neering and waste manage- ment, all closely linked to core activities.",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels GERMANY yesterday put its weight behind new Dutch pro- posals that would require European Community mem- bers to meet tough inflation, budgetary and monetary tar- gets before joining a European currency union. The proposals, discussed for the first time yesterday by rep- resentatives of EC finance min- isters, drew criticism from sev- eral southern countries. Many are worried they will be unable to meet the strict conditions required for economic and monetary union (Emu). The UK, which has stressed the need for economic conver- gence to precede monetary union also backed the propos- als. Its specific concern - that the UK parliament be allowed to decide later on any eventual British participation - is, for the first time, explicitly catered to in the draft Emu treaty. The Dutch text says: \"Mem- ber states which fulfil the [con- vergence] conditions shall decide whether they will par- ticipate in stage three [of Emu].\" The previous text, drafted in June by Luxembourg, dealt only with the case of countries such as Greece and Portugal, which might be economically incapable of following the majority into Emu. The posi- tion of countries such as Britain, which might be politi- cally unwilling to do so, was not discussed. The prospect of a twospeed move to Emu is further enhanced by the Dutch sugges- tion that Emu could start when only six states were eco- nomically and politically ready, rather than the eight earlier proposed. On present rating, the six could be Germany, the Benelux trio, Denmark and France. Sig- nificantly France, which other Mediterranean countries want as an ally, did not join Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece in criticising the Dutch proposals. The Dutch draft, which will be discussed by finance minis- ten next Monday, proposes that the transitional stage two (starting in 199) is reviewed by end-196. It suggests that no state should be eligible to enter stage three unless, for two years previously, it had met certain 1C.aic I et."

   "article_dc_title" : "The Cracks at Taylor Woodrow",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "There are two possible reactions to yesterday's dread- ful gures from Taylor Wood- row. One is to assume that the plight of other UK contractors must be even worse than previ- ously thought. The other is to question whether the company still merits its tag as one of the sector's blue chip investments. It is not that the 33 per cent slump in pre-tax profits was badly out of line with market expectations. The real worry is the size and nature of the first half provisions and the fact that these were only offset by capital gains from a major south-coast property disposal. The Danish bridge problem, to be fair, was well enough known, though yesterday's hit is thought to be more than double the Â£4m provided at the end of last year. Nor does a write down of the St Mary Abbots housing development - perhaps of the order of Â£7m-Â£8m - come completely out of the blue. Probably the most alarming of the three troublespots is the US contract- ing side where another Â£8m is thought to have been provided for in the first six months. The difficulty for the shares, which stand on a prospective multiple of more than 25 at last night's closing price of 213p, is not just the prospect of further provisions in the second half - development properties and land in the US and Spain being possible write down candi- dates. Without much in the way of UK housebuilding the shares can hardly look attrac- tive to those still punting on early economic recovery. Viewed as a property play they are trading on a premium to net asset value. And, while the company's financial strength is the envy of Costain and Wim- pey, it will be needed to pay two years of uncovered divi- dends. Bowater Given the dire state of the paper and packaging sector, Bowater's interim figures are commendable, even if the 5.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits is not quite what it appears. Net interest income is swollen by nearly Â£8m as a result of capitalisation of inter- est on the new Australian tis- sue plant and amortisation of the group pension surplus. Nonetheless, Bowater has managed to contain the fall in its operating margins to just one percentage point in the face of sharply contracting vol- umes. Its new Australian plant has added to capacity just as it is being reduced by its main competitor, Kimberley-Clarke. FT-SE Index: 2m.0 (-10.6) Taylor Woodrow Share price relative to the FT-A AI-Share Index 115 90 85 8 1990 J 1991 S -auo: Dutaaearn Overall, the company is well- placed to exploit recovery when it comes. The big uncer- tainty is how soon this will be. Bowater itself is not particu- larly sanguine, particularly as it sees very little sign of the normal pre-Christmas pick-up in orders. With the shares on a prospective multiple of around 15, the stock market appears to be finally honouring the new management's achievements. But it may also be prematurely discounting recovery in Bowater's main markets. Water companies Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water shares, out comes another of Ofwat's carefully- phrased letters. Mr Ian Byatt is showing a remarkable persis- tence, refining his earlier state- ments on diversification as well as reminding the compa- nies that their price formula can be subject to unscheduled review. By previous standards, though, yesterday's interven- tion was gentle. The companies can afford to be a little relaxed. They know that Mr Byatt is likely to stick to his previous line that the investment needs of the industry must be viewed in a medium-term framework. Assuming he is not provoked, he is simply looking for a few voluntary gestures on pricing like those made last year by Yorkshire and Southern. It all suggests that the com- panies are reaching an accom- modation of sorts with the reg- ulatory regime. So long as they respond positively to Ofwat's needling they face a gradual attrition of their operating freedoms rather than a rude ducking. It is tempting to damn the instability created by such regular interventions on the grounds that it damages the market's ability to price water shares. While there has undoubtedly been a long-term \"Byatt effect\", there is no really conclusive evidence to prove the short-term thesis. The stock market's ability to shrug off yesterday's news sug- gests the sector is driven rather more by the fluctuating attractions of other cyclical stocks than by specific regula- tory moments. Sedgwick The market is likely to be rather more interested in what David Rowland has to say about Lloyd's of London than it was in yesterday's rather flattish interim profits from the company he chairs. Follow- ing similar noises last month from Willis Corroon, though, at least a consistent picture of the UK insurance broking sector has emerged. The main sea- tures are determined cost cut- ting (with Sedgwick perhaps having the edge), a continua- tion of dull premium prospects in the US and severe reinsur- ance capacity shrinkage in the UK. The extent to which Sedg- wick's oil and gas business can be placed is one of several uncertainties for the second half. Comparisons with Willis are inescapable. The latter's US links look the more promising in the long term, Sedgwick seems better placed in Europe in the short term. Prospective multiples of around 20 suggest that investors are expecting a great deal from both. Interest rates It is hard to believe that just three months ago the UK gov- ernment seemed caught in a vicious circle oft interest rates. With economic pessimism undermining its standing in the polls, it was constrained from delivering rate cuts required to secure a recovery. Now, thanks partly to Mr John Major's sudden prominence on the world stage, the outlook is a little brighter. The polls have moved in the government's favour and sterling is firm. Whether or not the authori- ties decide to rush in, there is probably room for only a cou- ple of half point cuts between now and the end of the year. Political prudence might sug- gest conserving the first till closer to the party conference in early October, after the large fall expected in the head- line rate of inflation for August. By contrast, moving now would open up the possi- bility of a second cut before a November election.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Hugo Dixon THE government has been told by its advisers in the sale of part of its BT shareholding to sack Salomon Brothers as its lead US manager. It seems inevitable that Salo- mon will be removed from its high profile role when ministers meet this morning to decide what to do. Mr Norman Lamont, chan- cellor of the exchequer, and Mr Francis Maude, financial secre- tary, are then expected to inform Lord Young, the former cabinet minister who is now a director of Salomon. Unless he can provide what one adviser called a \"wild card\" explaining why Salomon has to be retained, the firm will be fired as US lead manager. Goldman Sachs, which was runner-up in the original selection, is expected to be appointed by the end of the week. The other finalists were Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stan- ley. Ministers would like to make their decision known today before tomorrow's BT presenta- tion to around 70 analysts. This is the final briefing before ana- lysts' research papers are pre- pared later this month in advance of the Â£5bn BT sale in November. However, an announ- cement is not expected until later in the week. The recommendation to sack Salomon is a blow to the firm as it tries to re-establish its reputa- tion following the news that it rigged recent US Treasury bond auctions. Mr John Gutfreund, the former chairman who was recently forced to resign, made the origi- nal presentation to the UK Trea- sury. However, Salomon's expected removal will not come as a stir- prise to some directors. They believed that it would have been difficult for ministers to keep the firm in its present role. Lord Young, who is leading the committee responsible for ensur- ing that Salomon keeps within the rules, said that he did not believe there were any more \"skeletons in the company's closet\". He said that if Salomon was removed from its present role that would be a \"political deci- sion\". But he argued that time would eventually restore the company's credibility. The government's advisers, however, believe that the firm made a fatal error when it made it known that it was worried about losing its position as the US lead manager. The advisers believe that this increased media speculation which further dam- aged the firm's position. Lord Young, who is also execu- tive chairman of Cable and Wire- less, the UK-based international telecommunications group, sought to reassure C and W shareholders that he would not be side-tracked from this job by the Salomon role. \"It will be an increase in responsibility but not in work- load,\" he said."

Brent Walker's directors are concerned about their legal posi- tion under insolvency law, in the event that the company is trad- ing insolvently. They have asked Standard Chartered, which heads a steering committee of the com- pany's banks, to obtain confirma- tion that they have not changed their minds about backing a refi- nancing of Brent Walker, which has debts totalling Â£1.5bn. If any bank says it will no lon- ger support the reconstruction, Brent Walker will go ito receiv- ership. The director of an inter- national bank said: \"Standard Chartered has its work cut out.\" Another banker said there was no formal deadline. \"Standard needs to provide an assurance to the directors within the next cou- ple of days,\" he added. There is a risk that some banks will withdraw their support, fol- lowing the company's decision last week to invite the Serious Fraud Office to examine its affairs.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fidwhr in Frankfurt TALKS about joint shareholding between Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnais have collapsed over differences of banking policy and management style between the German commercial bank and the French state-owned insti- tution. The breakdown in talks came amid news that the rival German Dresdner Bank and the French stateowned Banque Nationale de Paris were on the way to an agreement on cross-holdings and frther limited cooperation. Commerabank has made clear in recent weeks that it was uneasy about earlier plans which would have led to it taking a 7 pe cent stake in Credit Lyon- .els, which would in turn have t 10 per cent of the German Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, has taken a more sober approach to the qu- tion of co-operating with Crddit Lyonnais since Mr Martin Kohl- haussen succeeded Mr Walter Seipp as chief executive in June. The French bank recently opened a further German branch in Baden-Baden, thus making it apparent that a joint holding would not hinder it from expand- ing on the other bank's territory. The German bank has made no statement yet about the ending of talks with Crdit Lyonnais, which still maintained yesterday that it hoped for an eventual sharehol agreement with Both Mr Seipp and Mr Kohl- haussen have stressed that the bank could easily go it alone if no deal was signed by the end of this year. Like Dresdner, Germany's second largest bank, and Deut- sche Bank, the country's biggest, Commerbank has moved heavily into east Germany and plans to expand in eastern Europe. Mr Stephen Lewis, banking analyst with Salomon Brothers, said discussions between Com- merzbank and Crddit Lyonnais had looked like going sour over lack of compatibility in strategy and corporate culture and because the German bank did not want to be pulled into other ven- tures as it was investing in east- ern Germany and beyond. Credit Lyonnais has aded its foreign operations and ding considerably. Group lending grew by more than 80 per cent in the four years to 1980. One of its more controversial activities has been its lending to the US film industry, where its exposure is estimated at around $2.5bn (l1.47bn). This includes around $700m owed by MGM Pathe.

   "text_content" : "Japan's scandals alieriated private investors, reports Michiyo Nakamoto ~r*r~rrsPI*-,- ~C1I InsideTokyo's stock arrhbane: g volume has slumped to below MH)m shares as ~ivate investors have staved awav s officials from Nomura Securities, Japan's big- gest broker, gather this month for their biannual branch managers' meeting to assess the barm done by recent securities scandals and consider strategies for the future, their thoughts will no doubt turn to one of the most damaging legacies of the recent events - the alienation of the individual investor. Private investors are still fum- ing over revelations of unequal treatment by the country's lead- ing brokers. Their anger has been fanned by rising suspicions that Nomura Securities had manipu- lated trading in a particular stock to benefit a gangster group. Morale in the industry has hit rock bottom. Daily trading vol- ume, which averaged between Ibn and 2bn shares in the mar- ket's heyday, has slumped to well below 500m. Last month, volume shrank to below 200m shares for nine trading days in a row. The brokers admit that the alienation of the private investor has necessitated a reassessment of their future strategy. \"It is impossible for the time being even to tryto recover the trust of private investors while the public is gripied by the mood of securi- ties company bashing,\" says one Nomura official. \"But private investors are a very important source of busi- nesi for nus.- Once things have quietened down we will have to work seriously to regain their confidence.\" The Tokyo market has long benefited from private investors to an extent that neither London nor New York could claim. Pri- vate investors have also been a lucrative source of income for the securities companies, which still enjoy fixed commissions. At the large Japanese brokers, retail business has accounted for between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of overall business while at medium-sized firms the figure rises to 50 per cent or more. \"It is not surprising that UK brokers who rely on institutional investors are not as profitable as Japanese share traders scramble for a slice of the action Japanese brokers which have a high proportion of private client business,\" one Japanese broker said just before the scandals broke out. \"Private clients in Japan do whatever you tell them to,\" he confessed. With a combined salesforce of several thousand complemented by hundreds of sales staff work- ing in about 500 share shops all over Japan, the big four leading brokers had little difficulty drum- ming up activity in the country's low interest rate environment of the 1980s. For much of the glory days of Japanese equities, Nomura Secu- rities alone was responsible for about 30 per cent of trading. Together the big four accounted for about 75 per cent of market activity. Shares that were tar- geted by a Nomura sales cam- paign were thought to be virtu- ally assured of a strong rise. The questionable practices that the scandals have exposed were not unknown even to non-profes- sionals on the market. There had always been talk of brokers churning portfolios - turning them over more than is neces- sary to generate commission. Certain highly volatile stocks were known to be targeted by speculative groups. The existence of political stocks - stocks which are thought to be tools for political fund-raising and which often rose sharply for reasons that were never quite clear to the layman - was taken for granted. So were the industry's links with gangsters, although it was generally assumed that the more respectable brokers kept their distance. Individual investors went along with the game as they believed that they also stood to benefit from whatever it was the securities companies were up to. By bringing these practices into the open, the scandals destroyed the myth that, rigged as it may be, the market was providing everyone with their fair share of the gains. The Japanese finance minis- try's confirmation this week that it suspects Nomura of having manipulated stock in Tokyu Cor- poration to benefit the head of a criminal organisation, is tanta- mount to an allegation that Nomura sacrificed the interests of private investors for the bene- fit of one favoured client. The evidence of favouritism within the industry that has emerged with the scandals is only the latest blow to individu- als' confidence in the market. The growing influence of arbi- trage trading had already unset- tled private investors. Then last year the sharp falls in the market that slashed 40 per cent off the Nikkei average, further alienated individuals. \"The feeling of despair among individual investors is very strong,\" says one private inves- tor. \"We cannot believe what the brokers tell us any more.\" The private investor exodus is perhaps part of an inevitable trend towards greater institution- alisation of the Tokyo market. At the beginning of the 1980s individual investors comprised nearly 40 per cent of commission- based trades by Japan's inte- grated securities companies while institutions made up about 19 per cent. By last year, individ- uals accounted for 24 per cent and institutions 40 per cent. The big four will continue to need substantial retail business to sustain their extensive branch networks. Yet doubts are surfac- ing as to whether the mass-mar- keting strategy that helped pro- pel them to their present international status, has any part to play in their future strategy. he effectiveness of mass- marketing is waning also as a result of changing attitudes among the younger Jap- anese. The peer pressure that drove sales staff to do anything short of robbery to meet commis- sion targets, works less on the new generation, says one broker. The surge of individual activity fuelled by the mass-marketing tactics of the leading brokers, was an important factor behind the rapid rise of the Tokyo mar- ket. That rise, in turn, helped finance the expansion of Japa- nese corporations. In trying to bring the market up to the regulatory standards of the west, the authorities are walking a tightrope between the need to regain respectability and concern that drastic action could undermine the market's role as a source of cheap funds for corpo- rate Japan.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE SHARE price of Taylor Woodrow fell 12p to 213p yes- terday after the property and construction group announced substantial provisions to cover potential losses on interna- tional construction contracts and a London property devel- opment. The provisions, thought to total more than Â£20m, were announced as Taylor Woodrow revealed that pre-tax profits had tumbled by a third to Â£25.3m during the first six months of this year. Mr Peter Drew, chairman, said the results were \"an elo- quent reflection of the wide- spread effects of the current economic recession\". The company said that the provisions, which had been unexpected by analysts, had been offset to a large extent by the sale of Churchill Square, a development in Brighton, and by a 49 per cent reduction in tax from Â£12.9m to Â£6.6m. The decline in the tax charge was brought about by a change in the mix of property dispos- als during the first half, according to Taylor Woodrow. Individual provisions, each thought to run into several inuuon pounrsi, nau oeen 1140 against: * St Mary Abbotts, a town house and luxury flat develp- . ment in Kensington; * several substantial US con- struction contracts for which claims were being considered; * building the western bridge for the Stogebaelt project which will connect the said of Zeeland to the Jutland insular in Denmark. The con- tract has been awarded toi a consortium in which Taylbr Woodrow has a 21 per cent stake. This is the second batch of provisions to be announced by Taylor Woodrow on the Stote- baelt project. The bompany intends to submit claims to cover cost increases caused by design changes. I It had also imposed strict controls over taking further construction contracts in the US to. prevent further losses and provisions. Mr Drew said: \"We are enduring the worst conditions for over half a century and, despite all attempts to insulate the company from a major cyclical downturn, the impact of sustained high interest rates \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and a widespread lack of confi- dence has affected all sectors of the company's business adversely.\" Earnings per share, after adjusting for the Â£162m rights issue, slipped from 6.9p to 4.9p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.86p. About half of the rights issue cash had been commited for investment including the Â£41m purchase of a freehold indus- trial property portfolio from Slough Estates. The group had also acquired a modest office development in Berlin jointly with Norwich Union. At the end of June net debt had been reduced to 9 per cent of shareholders funds. Mr Drew said this reflected a healthy operating cash flow and a strong balance sheet. See Lex *",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper INTRUM JUSTITIA, the Netherlands-based debt collec- tion agency which obtained a London stock market listing last year, yesterday reported a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Â£4.6m for the half year to end-June. Following strong expansion, especially in the UK, turnover from fee income rose to Â£36.6m (Â£20.9m). Expenses climbed to Â£30.2m (Â£17.6m) and net financial income and expenses amounted to Â£1.8m (Â£256,000). Earnings per share advanced to 3.7p (2.9p) and the interim dividend is increased from 0.6p to 0.8p. The group's commercial debt businesses generated about 50 per cent of income, but over a third of revenues came from the UK, where buoyant demand from banks, building societies, credit card compa- nies, mail order companies and utilities fuelled growth in the consumer debt division. Mr Gert van Laar, European managing director, said Intruin now had a share of between 37 and 40 per cent of the market for consumer debt collection. UK revenues amounted to Â£13m. Elsewhere, Intrum remained strong in Sweden, where the company was founded in the 1920s, with turnover of Â£10.5m; Finland put in Â£2.5m, Germany Â£1.7m, Norway Â£3.3m, Switzer- land Â£3.3m and the Nether- lands Elm. Although the company only has 2 per cent of the UK mar- ket for commercial debt collec- tion, Mr van Laar believed there was potential for expan: sion in this area - especially in the area of cross-border debt collection. Intrum already works with NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, in a scheme offering a com- bined trade credit insurance and debt collection scheme to small and medium-sized busi- nesses.",

   "text_content" : "By Mlchlyo Nakamoto A SHARP drop in interest charges helped Scholl, the sup- plier of foot and personal healthcare products, lift interim pre-tax profits despite a decline in turnover. Group profit improved from Â£11.5m to Â£11.6m largely as a result of a fall in interest costs to Â£874,000 (Â£2.07m). Borrow- ings were eliminated with the net proceeds of Â£24.5m realised from the rights issue in May. Turnover fell to Â£82.9m (Â£87.3m) in the face of adverse exchange rates and a wide- spread downturn in consumer demand. The effect of a 4 per cent weakening in exchange rates was particularly pronounced as a large proportion of Scholl's business was based outside the UK. In the first half 75 per cent of turnover was derived from non-UK markets. Bad weather across Europe affected the footwear products business for which the months between April and June were crucial, said Mr Neil Fran- chino, chief executive. Meanwhile, severe destock- ing programmes adopted by both organised and indepen- dent traders in the UK and Europe affected business. It got to the point where chemists didn't care whether the cus- tomer had to go to the next store to buy what they wanted, Mr Franchino said. Turnover rose in the rest of the world, however, he said. Market share has been increased or maintained in all of its worldwide markets and a cost cutting programme had enabled operating margins to be broadly maintained. Scholl is looking to increase its presence in the market for over-the-counter health care products. With the help of a reduced tax rate earnings per share increased 12 per cent to 11.3p (10.lp). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p on the higher capital.",

As part of the reorganisa- tion, Lord Young, executive chairman, has also promoted Mr Peter van Cuylenburg, Mercury's previous chief exec- utive, to group director with responsibility for businesses in OECD countries. Mr Brian Pemberton, currently manag- ing director of C and W world- wide services, becomes group director for non-OECD coun- tries. The reorganisation follows the departure last month of Mr Gordon Owen, the group's managing director. It involves the creation of a new execu- tive chairman's committee consisting of Lord Young, Mr van Cuylenburg, Mr Pember- ton and Mr Rod Olsen, group director for finance and busi- ness planning. C and W argued that Mr Harris, 42, had the right com- bination of marketing skills and background in technology to make a success of Mercury. He is credited with making First Direct a force to be reck- oned with in competition with the big four clearing banks - a task Lord Young compared to Mercury competing against British Telecom. Lord Young made clear that yesterday's reshuffle was not the end to management changes. He reaffirmed his intention to appoint a new group managing director within a year saying that cur- rent members of the executive chairman's committee would report to this new executive. Mr van Cuylenburg point- edly corrected his chairman by saying that the roles of those in the committee rather than the individuals would report to the new managing director. This comment apparently revealed that Mr van Caylen- burg considers himself a frnt-ranner for the Job. front-runner for the lob.",

The company supplies a wide range of customers across many industries in the UK, US and Australia, and is highly sensitive to shifts in demand. Mr David Lyon, chief execu- tive, said theVe had been no improvement in its order books. \"It's damn difficult to tell when the recession is going to end,\" he said. In the first half, Bowater shed 670 employees and warned that a further 200 to 300 job losses could follow unless there was a pick-up in demand. In the six months to June 80, pre-tax profits advanced from Â£48.4m to Â£51m, although this improvement was entirely due to a reversal in the company's interest position. Operating profits from con- tinuing businesses slumped from Â£57m to Â£46.5m. But the company received interest income of Â£4.6m - including a credit from the amortisation of its pension fund surplus and capitalised interest - com- pared with payments of Â£11.5m In the comparable period. Gearing rose to 38 per cent during the half but this largely reflected the rise in the value of the dollar rather than an outflow of cash. At the end of the period Bowater had Â£250m of cash in London but had US and Aus- tralian dollar-denominated bor- rowings of Â£350m (revised to Â£405m following the 16 per cent rise in exchange rates during the half year). Sales from continuing busi- nesses fell 8 per cent to Â£606m (Â£658m). Operating profits from print and packaging slipped from Â£38.8m to Â£31.8m, although these were adversely affected by the division's expo- sure in Brazil. The coated industrial films division recorded static profits of Â£8.5m, engineering activities yielded a much-reduced Â£2m (Â£5.3m) and tissue and timber operations contributed Â£500,000 (Â£1.lm). But building materials saw a strong gain against the market trend to Â£3.7m (23.3m). Fully diluted earnings fell to 21.2p (23p). The interim divi- dend is held at 9.5p. See Lex",

   "text_content" : "ARD HEIT by a combi- nation at the recession and the costs of new product introductions, Psion, the London-based electronics company which is the UK's standard bearer in hand-held computers, barely turned in a profit in the first half of 1991. Its sales and profits before tax, substantially below last year's figures, raise fresh ques- tions about prospects for small, innovative European compa- nies in today's fast moving, cash-hungry, electronics marketplace. Pre-tax profits at Psion - best known for its Organiser electronic filing system - have now fallen for three consecu- tive half years. Mr David Pot- ter, founder and chairman, warned that although he believed the second half of 1991 would be better than the first, he did not anticipate a dra- matic improvement. Psion shares fell 2p to 40p on the news to equal their lowest price this year. For the six months to June 30 the company had turnover of Â£11.53m, some 25 per cent lower than in the first half of the previous year. Profit before tax of only Â£27,000 compared with Â£314,000 a year earlier and with Â£1.63m for the first half of 1989. For 1990 as a whole, sales totalled Â£31.4m. First half earnings per share fell from 0.87p to 0.12p but the interim dividend is maintained at Ip on the grounds that gear- ing remains low and that the company's financial position is sound. Mr Potter identified two rea- sons for Psion's disappointing performance. First, the failure of the MC range of laptop computers which should by now have 'taken over from the Organiser family as the main source of Psion's revenues. \"A gap in the company's products\" was how Mr Potter euphemistically described the failure of the range yesterday. The MC machines, in fact, contributed only about Â£1.25m W.on S mum M - 40C 35C 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 SoWa: DMmbam to revenues in the first half of the year and there is no indica- tion that the range is set for a sales revival. Mr Potter says the range will continue to be supported and developed, how- ever, including the introduc- tion this year of high quality word processing software. The MC machines were well received when first introduced, but sales were hampered ini- tially by a shortage of periph- eral equipment and business software from which they have never recovered. The company clearly under- estimated the scale of resources necessary to intro- duce and support such an inno- vative new product family. By the time peripherals and soft- ware had been developed and brought to market, the trend to Japanese \"notebook\" comput- ers had already started and Psion had lost a window of opportunity. \"We were unlucky in our timing\", Mr Potter says. econd, the recession brought an unprece- dented decline in capital spending which has damaged Psion's key corporate markets. The group's early success was based on the flexibility of the Organiser hand-held machines. Designed primarily for retail sales as an electronic diary and filing system the Organiser quickly established itself as a corporate tool finding applica- David Potter: Two reasons for the poor results tions in department stores, public utilities, banks and tele- communications companies. Retail sales of the Organiser have been in decline for two years as a result of competition from Japanese manufacturers offering more up-to-date tech- nology, but sales to corporate customers continue to provide the greater part of Psion's reve- nues. Mr Potter believes the Organiser has another three or four years of life, but sales - have inevitably been depressed during the recession. What hopes are there for recovery? The company has already cut business costs by 28 per cent and reduced stocks to a \"modest\" level. It is now looking to the breadth of its product line and the potential of new hand-held products to generate renewed profitability. Mr Potter believes there will be explosive growth in hand- held devices when business recovers, based on the power that can be built into a hand- held unit these days and the potential for linking hand-held computers over radio net- works. He argues that: * Problems at the company's troubled Dacom data communi- cations subsidiary, which depressed profits in earlier years, are now under control and the unit is contributing slightly to profits. * The company's new range of HO hand-held business com- puters was launched in April and has been well received; the range will make a contribution to profits in the second half of the year. * The company will launch a new pocket-sized computer next week which should attack a market that Japanese manu- facturers and US specialists in hand-held machines, like Hew- lett Packard, are trying to make their own. Mr Potter says- the new Psion computer will leap-frog Japanese prod- ucts in terms of power and functionality. Will the cost of supporting the new pocket computer prove as burdensome as supporting the MC range? Mr Potter says that the com- pany is ready to reap the bene- fit of its investment in technol- ogies for portable computers. All Psion's ranges use the same design principles, the same software and the same communications systems. \"Like a motor manufacturer, we can put different engines into the same chassis\". ut while it profited greatly from being first on the market with the Organiser type of product, there are already a number of pocket computers on offer. Has the window of opportu- nity again been lost? Mr Potter says the capabilities of the new device outstrip anything seen so far in pocket computers and at a significantly lower price. He believes it will set the stan- dard rather than follow it. The fact is that virtually all computer companies have been hit hard by the recession but Psion remains unsatisfactorily vulnerable both to fluctuations in the business cycle and to fashion. The MC range did not sell well because fashion in portable computing had, to some extent, passed it by. Analysts are suggesting pre- tax profits of Â£200,000 for the full year on sales of approxi- mately Â£25m. If there is to be jam at Psion, it will not sweeten Mr Potter's life before late 1992.",

Emap, the newspaper, maga- zine and local radio operator, which has a holding of 17.6 per cent, indicated that it would do so when forcing Mr Oyston's resignation. Mr Oyston, who holds n per cent, told the annual meeting that he would also take up his rights. Trans World's hopes of averting its debt crisis were dashed by recession and the slump in advertising during and after the Gulf war.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper AN UNEXPECTED fall in insurance rates in the US and the impact of exchange rate movements depressed Sedg- wick Grdup, the UK's biggest insurance broker, leaving it with interim pre-tax profits down from Â£67.7m to Â£65.3m. Earnings per share fell to 10p (10.4p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 4p. At constant exchange rates revenues for the six mopths to June 30 fell only 1 per cent, but declined 6 per cent in sterling terms to Â£355.7m (Â£377.5m). Operating income - from bro- kerage commission and fees -. decreased by 5 per cent to Â£326.lm (Â£842.8m). Lower UK and US interest rates were responsible for a 15 per cent fall in investment income to Â£29.6m (Â£34.7m). The impact was offset by a reduction in expenses to Â£286.6m (Â£303.6m), although the fall was marginal in constant exchange rate terms. Mr David Rowland, chair- man, admitted that the decline in rates over the second quar- ter in the US - which gener- ates about a third of operating income - had been surprising in view of the already depressed state of that market. \"We hadn't expected that the US market would weaken again. Rates are still going down. As the year has worn on it has become clear that people are writing business for market share,\" said Mr Row- land. Commercial insurance rates were also soft in the UK and Europe. Rates for marine and avia- tion insurance in the London market have risen, but the impact of increasing rates in the catastrophe reinsurance market in London had been off- set by a marked shrinkage in capacity with a number of rein- surers - Lloyd's syndicates and companies alike - quit- ting the market. EW Payne, the reinsurance subsidiary which generates about 15 per cent of Sedgwick's operating income, experienced an 11 per cent reduction in income to Â£42.4m (f47.9m). The unevenness in rating trends meant this was \"a very difficult market to do business in,\" said Mr Rowland. Despite the recent strength of the dollar, on average Sedg- wick was able through hedging to obtain a more favourable exchange rate in the first six months of 1990. Sedgwick claims continuing success in its efforts to reduce expenses, especially in North America. See Lex",

However, ongoing activities showed higher profits of Â£1.46m, against Â£1.12m. In the second half of the previous year the garden products and insurance broking activities were sold. The pre-tax figure was struck after net investment income of Â£814,000 (Â£275,000 charge). Turnover was Â£7.64m (Â£28m). After tax of Â£681,000 (Â£1.06m) earnings per share were 6.2p (7.7p). An unchanged interim dividend of 3.5p is declared. There was an extraordinary profit of Â£360,000 (Â£3.45m) aris- ing from the sale of the MV Iron Kirby for $3.9m (Â£2.2m). Stonehill Stonehill Holdings, a whole- saler of household goods and hardware, reduced its losses from Â£2.2m to Â£1.13m pre-tax for the year to March 31. Turnover totalled Â£1.6m (Â£5.76m), generating operating profits of Â£577,000 (losses Â£720,000). Interest accounted for Â£1.7m (Â£1.48m). Losses per share worked through at 5.34p (9.32p). After taking account of extraordi- nary credits of Â£135,000 (debits Â£3.87m) and preference divi- dends the retained loss amounted to Â£935,000 (Â£5.73m). Record In a \"reasonably satisfactory\" half year, Record Holdings achieved pre-tax profits of Â£1.57m, compared with Â£2.1m, after allowing Â£323,000 for the establishment of a new distri- bution facility in Toronto. Turnover for this manufac- turer of hand and power tools, fell from Â£18.9m to Â£13.4m. Activities discontinued or sold accounted for half of the home sales decline. Operating mar- gins improved from 13 per cent to 15 per cent. Earnings per share were 3.42p (4.83p) and the interim dividend is again 1.15p. OEM Taxable profits of Office and Electronic Machines rose from Â£10,000 to Â£14,000 for the half year to June 30. At the operating level the company incurred losses of Â£341,000 (profits Â£35,000) but these were offset by excep- tional credits of Â£273,000 and a swing from interest payable of Â£25,000 to income of Â£82,000. Turnover of continuing activities totalled Â£720,000 (Â£1.19m). Earnings per share emerged at 0.2p (0.13p) and a same-again nominal interim dividend of 0.lp is declared. Peek In the first half of 1991, Peek, the international traffic and field data systems group, saw pre-tax profit halve from Â£6.08m to Â£3.02m, \"in line with expectations in a generally weaker market\", explained Mr Ken Maud, chainnrman. Traffic operations continued to advance in Edropeand the US. The integration of the traf- sic systems business of Philips, acquired in April, was prog- ressing well and significant new contracts had been gained. Turnover rose to Â£38.1m (Â£35m). Earnings per share were 2.01p (3.98p) and the interim dividend is again 1.05p. Arthur Wood A 4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, from Â£39,000 to Â£41,000, was achieved by Arthur Wood & Son (Long- port). For the six months to June 30 turnover of this maker of earthenware products rose 10 per cent to Â£1.71m (Â£1.55m). Earnings per share edged ahead to 1.36p (1.28p). Isotron Isotron, the irradiation service group, announced a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30. Turnover rose 18 per cent to Â£6.44m, but trading profit declined slightly to Â£2.55m (Â£2.59m); with interest receiv- able down to Â£256,000 (Â£363,000) the pre-tax balance fell to Â£2.81m (Â£2.95m). Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said all the group's market sec- tors suffered from the reces- sion and some parts of the healthcare market had been unsettled by the NHS reforms. The electron processing busi- ness had been fully integrated and had a successful year. Earnings per share were 15.1p (15.5p). The final dividend is a proposed 2.34p for a total of 3.59p (3.12p). Thomas Jourdan Thomas Jourdan, the con- sumer products group, tumbled from pre-tax profits of Â£532,000 to losses of Â£595,000 for the half year to June 30. Turnover fell 16 per cent to Â£11.2m (Â£13.3m). Losses per share worked through at 2.21p (1.92p earnings) and the interim dividend is cut by Ip to 0.5p. WSP WSP Holdings, a consulting engineering group, reported a marginal fall in pre-tax profits from Â£636,000 to Â£613,000 in the six months to end-June. The result was struck on turnover slightly reduced to Â£5.27m (Â£5.31m) and after net interest payable of Â£187,000 (Â£59,000). The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.lp, payable from earnings per share of 4p (4.9p)."

The success Looking closer at the of the Confucian causes, one of the first philosophy in the things that springs to mind computer age. are the teachings of Confu- cius, dating back over 2,500 years ago - a school of thought which laid the groundwork for an unusually favorable economic environment. The foundation for success has been built on an uncompromising recognition of competence, the importance of getting a good education, and especially the individual's profound feeling of being at one wit th society and his employer. It goes without saying that such strengths, which have evolved over generations, also involve duties. For in order to sustain the climate of harmony, each individual is expected to comply with various, and at times subtle, rules of behavior. To take an example: those much- beloved and protracted business dinners are not designed primarily as a medium for business negotiations. But by fostering a state of harmony and creating the correct atmosphere, they do help one successfully conduct business. If in the course of negotiations you are confronted with a situation where you could in some way cause your counterpart to alose face,\" you should refrain from persisting even if you are clearly in the right. You can expect this demonstration of good will to be met with grateful recognition, even if none of those present openly show it. By behaving in this way, you will have by no means lost influence. On the contrary, you will have shown that you have taken to heart the most important rule of conduct: always permit your counterpart to save face in a dignified manner. And by doing so, you will also further your own interests. Business in Asia require:' patience and time. But once accepted, you'll always be accepted. Dresdner Bank has been an active and respected member of the Asian business scene for many years now, with nearly five hundred committed professionals - both western and eastern - serving customers with their experience and expertise.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay MTM, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday reported a 94 per cent increase in profits as it successfully began to inte- grate last year's acquisition of Hardwicke, which nearly dou- bled its fine chemicals produc- tion capacity. Pre-tax profits in the six months to end-June rose from Â£5.3m to Â£10.3m on sales up 70 per cent at Â£61.4m. Mr Richard Lines, chairman, said organic profits growth, stripping out the effect of last year's series of acquisitions, was about 30 per cent. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 9.2p and the interim dividend is raised 10 per cent to 1.87p. Net debt since the year end has risen by Â£28m to Â£71m, giv- ing gearing of 60 per cent. Mr Lines said that Â£13m of that increase resulted from the effect of translating dollar debt into sterling for reporting pur- poses. Debt had also risen as a result of increased working capital levels, which Mr Lines said was seasonal, and because customers were taking longer to pay. The trading performance in agro-chemicals was hit by the late spring in the US and Europe which limited growth. Pharmaceutical and research chemicals enjoyed a 70 per cent advance in profits as the com- pany's share of the expanding market continued to grow. Profits from performance and speciality chemicals - which are supplied to indus- trial users for specific tasks, as opposed to fine chemicals which are bought for what they are in terms of chemical specification - also held up. Mr Lines said that a larger proportion of the capital expen- diture budget was being spent on health, safety and environ- mental investments. About 30 per cent of the Â£7.5m capital spend in the period was allocated to these investments, which have become increasingly imnportant with the passage of new envi- ronmental legislation last year. * COMMWNT ICI's placing of its stake in March has recently caused MTM's shares to trade at a dis- count to the chemicals sector. But yesterday's results support the view that its targeting of resilient sectors across a range of countries is working. In par- ticular, the company's invest- ment in pharmaceutical and research chemicals last year appear to be paying handsome dividends. Of some concern is the level of debt, exaggerated by translation from dollars for reporting purposes, but never- theless substantially up. For MTM to grow it will have to either make more acquisitions or invest heavily in capital equipment, both of which might be difficult at these debt levels unless it issues paper. This year James Capel is fore- casting profits of Â£23m, giving earnings per share of 20.8p, and a prospective multiple of 12.8.",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard RISING COSTS and lapsed policies in its life assurance subsidiary led to an interim loss of Â£4.26m at Hambro Coun- trywide, the estate agency and financial services group. The taxable deficit for the six months to June 30 com- pared with adjusted profits of Â£952,000 last time. Despite lapsing into the red, the group increased market share selling 15 per cent more houses than in the comparable period. Mr John May, joint manag- ing director, said that the losses had been incurred chiefly because of increased provisions against policy lapses in Hambro Guardian Assurance, the life assurance subsidiary, and the cost of developing a direct sales force. There had also been addi- tional costs in the estate agency branches reflecting staff numbers increased from 2,600 to 2,700. Turnover was Â£46.6m, up from Â£43.53, but life assurance profits were down from Â£4.85m to Â£2.89m. The residential estate agency division benefited from slightly higher commission rates which offset the decline in average house prices. Turnover in the division was Â£29.6m, up from Â£26.3m, but losses rose from Â£3.03m to Â£3.82m. Losses per share were 1.3p against earnings of 0.19p. The interim dividend is maintained at a nominal 0.05p. Mr Christopher Sporburg, chairman, said that conditions for the remainder of the year would be tough, but the com- pany continued to believe in its strategy of reducing depen- dence in the medium term on the housing market.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger PENTOS, the bookselling, stationery and office furniture group, yesterday surpassed most forecasts with static pre- tax profits of Â£2.9m. Analysts, who had been pre- dicting profits of between Â£2m and Â£2.9m for the six months to June 30, said the results were commendable in the cir- cumstances. The shares closed up 14p at 263p. The group also announced plans for a nationwide dis- counting campaign in the autumn which could spark a price war, thus signalling the endof the net book agreement. \"The fact that one of the four major publishing houses has decided to leave the NBA has changed things dramatically\", said Mr Terry Maher, chair- man. The Reed Group, which incorporates Octopus, Methuen and Hamlyn, has abandoned the agreement to fix prices and Andre Deutsch has published a non-net title for the first time. Discounting would have a beneficial impact on profits, said Mr Maher. He cited signifi- cantly higher sales during the discounting of last year's Booker Prize shortlist, before a court injunction intervened. Turnover rose from Â£69.9m to Â£85.8m. However, profits growth was held back by a decline in the office furniture division. Retail sales, which incorporate the Dillons book shops, Athena print and card stores and Ryman stationery, were ahead by 33 per cent to Â£75.6m for trading profits of Â£3.2m (Â£2.5m). Mr Maher said the introduc- tion of electronic point of sale systems in Dillons had led to better stocked shelves and thus much higher sales in several shops. Hatchards, the loss-making book store chain bought in August last year, had done bet- ter than break even before tak- ing into account central costs, said Mr Patrick Hooper, finance director. Earnings per share fell from 2p to 1.7p and the interim divi- dend is raised to 0.7p (0.6p).",

Bombardier will receive a dividend of Â£8m, the first time in many years that Shorts has been profitable enough to make a distribution. Turnover in the year to end- January was Â£355m, a riseof 31 per cent on the previous year's annualised figure. Comparison with the last accounting period of 10 months was difficult as it included six months under gov- ernment ownership and four in the private sector. Nevertheless, the results reflected the radical changes in working practices under Bom- bardier The most important element of the outcome was interest received from cash reserves invested on a short term basis. Shorts was able to utilise large reserves received from the gov- ernment as part of the arrange- ments transferring the com- pany to Bombardier. Mr Roy McNulty, managing director, said the results were encouraging and that the com- pany's business plans remained on course.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt and William Diwkb in Paris DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second largest bank, and Banque Nationale de Paris, France's largest state-owned bank, are on the verge of com- pleting a wide-ranging collabo- ration agreement which will involve cross-shareholdings of around 10 per cent. The two banks will shortly present their proposals to the European Commission in Brus- sels - possibly in a few weeks - and to their shareholders. BNP said several details remained to be worked out, including the exact size of the mutual shareholdings. Both banks indicated, however, that these were likely to be around 10 per cent. Like Commerzbank, the third biggest German bank, and Credit Lyonnais, also state-owned, Dresdner and BNP said earlier this year that they hoped soon to take mutual shareholdings. But Comnierzbank has given up the idea of negotiating cross-holdings with Crddit Lyonnais after differences on future expansion policy and in management and banking styles. In April, Commerzbank said talks were at an \"advanced stage\". Since then, it has reas- sessed its association with Credit Lyonnais, which recently opened another Ger- man branch in Baden-Baden. Talks have now ended. The links between Dresdner and BNP were recently extended with the two banks' decision to open a joint ven- ture bank in Prague, possibly with a local Czechoslovakian partner. They already have combined operations in Hun- gsry, Turkey and Switzerland, and plan to start up shortly in Poland. The possibility of closer links between German and French banks was given a new impetus in April, when the French government decreed that private concerns could take minority stakes in state- owned groups. The Paris administration's latest plans to extend partial privatisations further improved the political climate for such moves. Analysts said the reason that the Dresdner/BNP deal was now going ahead, while that between Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnais was not, reflected differences in style between the French banks. Commerzbank was uneasy about the aggressive plans of Credit Lyonnais, while DIed-- nor was obviously satisfied that BNP's ambitions were more restrained. Moreover, Dresdner and BNP have had .members on each other's boards since .1989. Both are expected to agree to refrin rom expanding in each other's markets. There could also be joint acquisitions in third markets and, possibly later, some form of amalgamation of the two banks' foreign operations. The conclusion of the BNP deal will add a further big shareholder to Dresdner's own era, following the news in July that Allianz, the leading Ger- man insurance group, had raised its stake in the bank to 23 per cent. Dresdner's market capitalisation is DM13.5bn ($7.8bn)",

The group made BFr2.lbn ($58.4m), boosted by the 20 per cent increase in net profits from its 800 Food Lion super- markets across the US which made $93.5m on increased sales of $2.91bn ($2.47bn) in the first 24 weeks of 1991. The compa- ny's Super Discount Markets, near Atlanta, began to break even in the last month of the first half. Delhaize said that, in the first 32 weeks of 1991, the sales increase at Food Lion had slowed slightly to 16.9 per cent because fewer new stores were opened in the first half of the year. During the last 20 weeks of the fiscal year the company intends to add up to 75 stores to the 809 already operating. In the first half, Food Lion sales accounted for more than two-thirds of the group's total consolidated sales of BFrl49bn.

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins THE FRENCH and German aerospace industries are on the point of announcing a co-operation accord in the production of a new generation of short-range anti-aircraft missiles. Thomson CSF, the French defence electronics group, Adrospatiale and MBB, the German aerospace group, plan to announce details of the agreement tomorrow, according to officials of the French companies. The agreement comes six months after Thomson shelved plans to pool its missile-making business with British Aerospace, a move which the French company attributed at the time to the changing requirements of the defence market in the aftermath of the Gulf war. Speculation has been growing over a reshuffle in European missile co-operation in recent days, since the decision by A6rospatiale, MBB and Matra, the French space, telecommunications and transport group, to shelve indefinitely another joint programme, launched last year, to produce a faster version of the Roland ground to air missile, to be called the RM-5. The existing generation of Roland missiles is produced jointly by Adrospatiale and MBB. The decision to delay the modernisation of the Roland missile has left Adrospatiale and MBB seeking new partners in missile development at a time when Thomson was also reassessing its plans.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins COMPAGNIE Bancaire, the French financial services group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent decline in group net profits to FFr676m ($113.42m). Compagnie Bancaire, the largest subsidiary of Paribas, the leading French investment bank, saw a 42 per cent decline in operating income to FFr561m. The bank, which specialises in leasing, consumer credit, mortgages and direct mail insurance, attributed the earn- ings decline to a fall in profits from its British activities and from its property lending and investment division. There was an increase in profits from lending to individuals and from life insurance and savings. Overall, the demand for new loans in France and abroad fell by 9 per cent in the first half. Credit outstanding rose by 12 per cent over the past year to FFr229bn by the end of June. The latest results bring Com- pagnie Bancaire's group net profits over the 12 months to the end of June to FFrl.22bn, a 33 per cent decline on the pre- vious year, while operating profits have fallen 41 per cent to FFrlbn over the same period.",

By contrast, the state-con- trolled company's trading per- formance slipped only slightly, with a 1 per cent decline In operating profits to Fr8.38bn over the same period. Rhone-Poulenc said it was aiming for substantial growth in operating income for the year. Operating income rose sharply in the second quarter, by 19.4 per cent from the same period of last year, to FFrt.6bn. Rh6ne-Poulenc attributed this to the continued strong demand for health-care prod- acts, which stockbrokers esti- mate account for more than half of operating profits following last year's acquisi- tion of Rorer, the US drug- maker. Chemicals and fibres saw an improvement in income during the second quarter, as did the Brazilian subsidiary, Rhodia. Agrochemical profits fell in the second quarter. Group sales rose by 5.7 per cent in the first half, to FFr42.28bn from FFr39.99bn in the first six months of 1990. Interest charges rose from FFrl.66bn to FFr2.2bn, a leg- acy of a heavy international buying spree over the past two years. - Gains from the asset sales which Rh6ne-Poulene is mak- ing to reduce its debts fell from FFr804m in the first half of last year to FFr201m. Asset sales were only FFr76m in the second quarter, against FFr440m in the comparable period last year. Analysts are expecting asset sales to pick up again towards the end of this year. * SANOFI, the pharmaceuti- cals and cosmetics unit of Elf Aquitaine, the French state oil company, reported first-half 1991 net consolidated group profit up 15 per cent to FFr405m from FFr351 a year ago, on revenues up 1.6 per cent to FFr9.57bn from FFr9.42bn, Our Financial Staff writes.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Fosbr In Hong Kong A CONSORTIUM led by Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of Peking's China and International Trust and Invest- ment Corporation (Citic), is set to win control over Hang Chong Investment, a trading and agency group which is one of Hong Kong's largest unlisted companies. The consortium, which also involves some of Hong Kong's leading businessmen, yester- day announced a HK$6.94bn (USbsOlm) cash offer for Hang Chong. The company's board is recommending the offer, and 44.3 per cent of shareholders have already accepted. The bid needs 50 per cent approval to become unconditional. The deal will transform Citic Pacific into a leading concern in Hong Kong, and the com- pany is now likely to apply to become a constituent of the Hang Seng index. According to some analysts, Citic Pacific will be Hong Kong's first mainland Chinese \"hong,\" or trading conglomer- ate, as 1997 - and return of the colony to China - approaches and companies like Jardine Matheson leave. The Citic group is known as the most aggressive and capi- talistic of China's state-owned corporations. It moved into Hong Kong in the 1980s and last year took over a shell com- pany which has been expanded to become the publicly listed Citic Pacific. This listed arm owns a 12.5 per cent stake of Cathay Pacific Airways, 20 per cent of the Macau telephone monopoly and other property holdings. The private arm, Citic (Hong Kong), also owns 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom. Citic Pacific has a 36 per cent stake in the consortium and will finance the purchase through a placement of 1.29bn shares to raise HK$2bn. Other shareholders in the consortium include Mr Li Ka- shing with 19 per cent, Mr Rob- ert Kwok's Kerry Trading with 7 per cent and Mr Larry Yung, managing director of Citic (Hong Kong) with 6 per cent. Citic Pacific also announced yesterday its first interim prof- its since a restructuring in June which saw the company's name changed from Tylfull. Net profits rose 34.5 per cent to HK$41.8m; the interim divi- dend is 1.7 cents a share.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn PENTLAND Group, the British sports shoe group, may increase its shareholding in Germany's Adidas sportswear concern beyond its current 25.05 per cent, Mr Rend JAggi, Adidas chief executive, hinted in Munich yesterday. He also forecast a 50 per cent increase in Adidas's operating profits this year - from DM40m to around DM60m - with further progress to come. Mr Jiiggi claimed that Pen- tland had exercised the option to buy a further 5 per cent of Adidas, which it took out last month when it paid Â£46m ($77.28m) for its initial 20.05 per cent stake in the company. He thought there would be more to follow, noting that Pentland was likely to reduce further its stake in US competitor Reebok. Pentland raised around $396m earlier this year by sell- ing part of its holding in Ree- bok and used part of the cash in July to buy the Adidas Pony sports shoe brand. It followed up a month later with the pur- chase of its stake in the Ger- man group. Adidas' turnover to the end of July, at DM2.12bn ($1.21m), was 8 per cent up on the com- parable part of 1990, Mr Jiggi said. Revenues from continued sales of subsidiaries and brands would at best equal last year's figure of DM56m, and he said he was \"certain\" of pre-tax profits for the year of DM8Om to DM90m when proceeds of these sales were added to oper- ating income. If the proposed disposal of the Le Coq Sportif brand pro- ceeded according to plan, the pre-tax result might even reach DM115m, Mr Jiggi added.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications and auto- mation group, yesterday reported a 2.7 per cent advance to SFr1.39bn ($909m) in first- half sales. Incoming orders at SFrl.4bn declined by 2.4 per cent com- pared with the first six months of 1990. Newly-consolidated companies contributed some 6 per cent to the increase in sales volume. Despite the strained eco- nomic situation, Ascom said, the operating profit for 1991 as wva a whole should be slightly higher than the SFrl32m in earnings before interest and tax recorded last year. First- half profits were not disclosed. Last year, the group generated a cash flow of SFr249m on con- solidated sales of just under SFr3bn and recorded a net profit of SFr52m. In June, the management forecast slight improvements in both turnover and earnings this year. Yesterday, it said it expected to maintain turnover at around the 1990 level, while the restructuring introduced two years ago should ensure a higher operating profit. Ascom has been trying hard to expand outside Switzerland, and the first-half figures do not include this year's new acquisi- tions which are expected to expand group turnover by 10 per cent over a full year. In a joint venture with Mer- cedes Information Technolo- gies of South Africa, the Swiss group paid $207m for the Time- plex networking arm of Unisys, the US computer company.",

   "text_content" : "By Nikki Taft in New York &nd Haig Simonlan in Milan CONTINENTAL Corporatlon. a US property-casualty nsur- ance group, said yesterday it had reached an agreement in principle with Generall, the large but secretive Italian insurer, on future co-operation between the two companies. Continental will service and underwrite all North Ameri- can exposures on Generali's multinational accounts. The two groups will also \"provide mutual access to their world- wide facilities in support of multinational activities\" and \"pursue joint marketing and production of multinational risks\". Continental added that the companies would \"continue to explore other areas of mutual interest throughout the world. There has been much specu- lation that Generall, based in Trieste, might be limbering up for acquisitions, possibly in the US where it has only mod- est representation, unlike many of its European competi- tors. The speculation intensi- fled following the announce- ment of a record Ll,750bn ($1.3bn) rights issue in May. Mr Michael Marchesani, president of Continental's international operations, stressed the deal represented a \"straightforward commercial insurance opportunity\", with no other \"financial conse- quences\". He suggested that Continen- tal stood to gain credibility through the link-up, and would benefit from Generall's access in Latin America and Europe. In 1990, Continental's premi- ums totalled $4.59bn, while after-tax profits slipped to $141.1m, against $153.1m the previous year. Generall has been wary of giving any details of how the funds from its rights issue, due to be launched on the Milan bourse shortly, will be used. Mr Eugenio Coppola di Canzano, Generali's chairman, said the funds would used for expansion, particularly in life Insurance. However, the com- pany has also hinted at acqui- sitions.",

   "text_content" : "By NIkki Talt CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier which has operated under bankruptcy court pro- tection since last December, yesterday confirmed it had held \"very preliminary\" talks with an investor group headed by Mr H. Ross Perot. Mr Perot runs the privately- owned Perot Group, which developed the Alliance Air- port, a cargo and industrial facility in Texas. A spokesman for Continen- tal sought to downplay the sig- nificance of the talks, describ- ing them as no more than \"tire-kicking\". He also suggested that talks with potential suitors or investors had not been confined to the Perot Group. Much speculation has sur- rounded the future of Conti- nental, formerly run by Mr Frank Lorenzo. The carrier, the fifth largest in the US, is heavily-indebted and made large operating losses last year, when it reported a $2.3bn after-tax loss. While a large part of this sum reflected write-offs related to its sister carrier, Eastern Airlines, the bottom- line figure did contain a $273.8m operating deficit. 0 A US bankruptcy court yes- terday delayed until today a hearing on a proposed $155m financing package for America West, the ailing Phoenix-based airline. The package includes $35m of debtor-in-possession financing from Britain's GPA Group and another 30m from Northwest Airlines.",

   "text_content" : "By Kamni Fossil in Oslo THE OSLO Stock Exchange has strongly criticised the for- mer management of Christi- ania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, for failing to accurately report credit losses. The bourse's investigation started about three weeks ago, shortly after Christiania announced first-half net losses of NKrl.637bn ($239m) and the resignation of Mr Sverre Wal- ter Rostoft, the bank's former president. ,Mr Kjell Froensdal, a bourse official who led the probe, said the former management of the bank had ignored advice from internal accounts auditors on reporting of credit losses. Mr Froensdal said the bank's credit losses may not have been reported at the appropri- ate time; this would have given an inaccurate picture of its financial status in the 18 months to June 1991. \"While the bank's previous leaders ignored advice . . .this was a demonstration of bad judgment, but not of a calibre which suggests a delib- erate infraction of the share law,\" Mr Froensdal said. Mr Froensdal said this policy prejudiced the interests of shareholders who have a right to know the bank's true sinan- cial position. Mr Borger Lenth, Christi- ania's new president, said he agreed with the bourse's find- ings, but said that it was the bank's new board chairman who earlier suggested possible financial reporting irregulari- ties. \"The earlier management was not realistic in the estima- tion of losses and this was despite the warnings and advice of those in charge of accounts,\" Mr Lenth said. The bourse said that Christi- ania's accounts reporting would be monitored, but dis- missed further investigations into possible violation by the bank of reporting of stock sen- sitive information, which may have led to insider trading. \"The case is now closed ... and the bank can get on with its task of securing the right footsteps toward the future,\" Mr Lenth added.",

   "text_content" : "A MERGER between Nora Industrier and Orkla Bor- regaard, two Norwegian food and drinks companies, is to be delayed at least three weeks until the government has com- pleted an anti-monopoly inves- tigation, writes Karen Fossli. The merger, which was announced in mid-June, would create Norway's third biggest company with an annual turn- over of NKrl5.5bn ($2.27bn). The investigation will be undertaken by the govern- ment's Price Directorate, which advises the Price Coun- cil. The council can block mergers that it believes would hinder competition. However, it is widely expec- ted that the Price Directorate will allow the merger to go for- ward, with the condition that the two companies reorganise some segments of their busi- nesses. The new company is to con- centrate on consumer goods, with the main emphasis on food and drinks, but it will also focus on activities in chemicals and finance. The merger has wide politi- cal backing mainly because of concern that foreign compa- nies might acquire control of the stock of the two individual companies after 1993, when a free trade agreement is imple- mented between Efta and the European Community. Norway is a member of Efta. The merger has recently been overshadowed by an investigation by the Oslo Stock Exchange into alleged insider trading by three Nora board executives ahead of the formal June merger announcement.",

Mabanaft has annual sales of 260,000 tonnes of crude oil products, mostly gasoline and gas oil, and in 1990 achieved a turnover of $100m. The deal is expected to be finalised in October. Statoil did not reveal the purchase price. Statoil, the world's largest net exporter of light crude oil outside OPEC, is evaluating other possible acquisitions and co-operative deals to strengthen its foothold in the British export market for crude oil products. Statoil said the acquisition had grown out of previous co-operation between the two companies. In the past couple of years, Statoil has supplied Mabanaft with 160,000 tonnes of gasoline and gas oil. * Arcade Shipping, a listed company with interests in -shipping and oil drilling rigs, has given Reading & Bates, a US-based drilling rig owner, an option to buy its 42.6 per cent stake in Arcade Drilling for NKr583.9m ($85.6m).

   "text_content" : "By Loulis Kehoe in San Francisco COMPUTER Associates has agreed to buy Pansophic Systems for about $282m, in its latest move to achieve domi- pance in the computer soft- ware market. Pansophic's shares rose sharply on news of the agree- ment to close at $15% from a close of $11% on Friday. Computer Associates has agreed to pay $16.15 a share for all of Pansophic's 17.5m shares. Pansophic has established itself as a leader in the field of mainframe information retrieval software. Based in Lisle, Illinois, the company had 1990 revenues of $232m and net income of $20.6m. In the first quarter, to July 31, it reported losses of $9.9m on revenues of $44m, after an $8.3m restruct- uring charge. The company had closed 13 sales offices and laid off about 300 employees. Computer Associates, with 1990 revenues of $1.3bn, is sec- ond only to Microsoft in the computer software industry. While Microsoft focuses almost exclusively on the personal computer sector, Computer Associates offers software for a wide range of computer types, from mainframes to personal computers. Over the past five years the company has acquired several US software companies. Last month, it launched a cash ten- der offer to purchase On-Line Software International, in a deal valued at nearly $90m.

   "text_content" : "By Rhobet Thn m on In Tokyc FIVE senior officials from Mitsui Trust and Banking have begun restructuring the sinan- dally-troubled Dalichi Corpora- tion, the core company of Japan's Dalichi Real Estate group, which has been hurt by a downturn in property prices, higher interest rates and a weak stock market. The five, including a director of the Mitsui Trust board, are expected to recommend sales of the company's property and securities holdings in an attempt to reduce group debts reckoned by Dalichi to total about YlO,0bn ($8.8bn). The appointment of Mitsui Trust staff follows the collapse last week of Maruko, a prop- erty company which filed for court protection with outstand- ing debts of Y277.7bn after a sharp downturn in the market for one-room apartments, a popular speculative investment during the late 1980s. While Maruko's bankers rejected a restructuring plan proposed by the company, Mlt- sui Trust said the bank had decided to back Dalichi Corpo- ration because the collapse of the company could be disas- trous for the real estate sector. The transfer of staff from a main bank indicates to other lenders that a troubled com- pany will not be allowed to fail, though Japanese banks have been forced to become more selective about the com- panies they support. Mitsui Trust said the size of a company, the integrity of its management and the potential impact on the financial system are assessed before a decision is made on a restructuring. Dalichi said the company had asked for direct involvement by the bank because of the \"worsening conditions in the property market\". Daiichi Real Estate has also been hit by the problems in the apartment sector and by the general sluggishness of the Japanese property market. New apartment construction in July fell to its lowest level in almost two years, and apart- ment prices have fallen sharply in some areas. The continuing weakness in the market will make difficult the sale of property holdings, which include Japanese ofice, apartment and resort develop- ments, as well as two buildings in New York.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Westfeld in Sydney AUSTRALIAN mining group CRA has blamed soft alumin- lum, lead and zinc prices and production problems at its coal mines for a 49 per cent drop in net profit for the half-year to June 30. Earnings after tax for the six months fell to A$137.4m (US$107.3m) from A$269.5m, but the 1990 first-half figure was inflated by a A$60.8m abnormal contribution from the sale of part of the group's holding of convertible notes in Germany's Kl6ckner-Werke steel group. CRA has joined a string of Australian groups hurt by the recession to cut its dividend, in this case to 10 cents, fully- franked, compared with 24 cents for the 1990 first half. The group chief executive, Mr John Ralph, said CRA expected \"marginally higher\" earnings for the second half because of continuing strong results from its iron.ore divi- sion and improvements in the coal operations. CRA's sales for the first half of AS2.28bn were 4 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year, due mainly to improved volumes and prices from its Hamersley iron ore mine in western Australia. The group shipped a record 23m tonnes of iron ore from Hamersley, which earned the group A$189m, compared with A$139m in the first half last year. CRA had resolved pro- duction problems at two of its NSW coal mines and would receive a boost from the first shipment of coal from its 50 per cent-owned coal project, Kaltim Prima Coal, in Indon- esia. CRA booked losses from its 40 per cent-owned smelting group Pasminco, and a 64 per cent fall to A$20.4m in contri- bution from its 67 per cent sub- sidiary Comalco."

The medium Hong Kong bank, one of several local insti- tutions affected by depositor mini-run after the govern- ment's decision in early July to place Bank of Credit & Com- merce Hong Kong into tempo- rary liquidation, attributed the performance to a 16 per cent growth in deposits and a 31 per cent rise in lending.

   "text_content" : "A FTER three years of strong growth, Japa- nese machine tool-mak- ers are finally facing a slow- down. With machine tool orders down for the seventh month in succession, compa- nies are bracing themselves for lower sales and smaller profits. Most machine tool compa- nies are projecting a downturn in earnings for the current year to March 1992. Yamazaki Mazak, the largest Japanese machine tool-maker, says that a decline in orders is expected to depress earnings by 10 to 15 per. cent compared with last year. Amada, a leading metal- working machine-maker, says it will probably have to revise down its forecasts of a 9.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits of Y28.7bn ($209.9m) on a 5 per cent decline in sales of Y162bn, for the current year. For the past three years, the industry has seen orders soar by double-digit figures. Last year, helped by strong demand from the auto and electronics industries and a boom in capi- tal expenditure, machine tool orders rose 11 per cent to a record Y1,410bn. According to the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Associ- ation, machine tool orders started to weaken in October last year. In June, the seventh consecutive month of decline, orders fell 19 per cent. Ana- lysts at Salomon Brothers have revised down their machine tools orders estimate for the 1991 calender year from Yl3820bn to Yl,,00bn. Amada says that, while capital spend- ing plans were being imple- mented, the company had started to cut down on travel expenses and advertising. The machine tool industry has shown a pattern of cycles; the previous troughs have been in 1982, after the second oil shock, and int 1987, when the Japanese economy was affected by the appreciation of the yen. Given that, the cur- rent downturn does not come as a surprise. The question is, whether the trough will last longer than those of the previ- ous cycles. Higher interest rates have curbed companies' appetite for capital investment, and con- sumer demand for products such as cars has declined sharply. Registrations fell 8.3 per cent year-on-year in June, from double-digit increases last year, and VTR shipments for July fell 19.8 per cent, the fourth consecutive decline. Nissan Motor, for example, has recently announced plans to reduce plant and equipment investment for a while. Meanwhile, the fall in the stock market has also made fund-raising difficult as equity financing, which allowed com- panies to finance at low cost at the height of the bull market, has become expensive. Banks, having to clear capital asset ratio requirements, are cutting lending growth. Mr Michael Remington, ana- lyst at brokers SG Warburg, says the outlook has become more bearish as the expected recovery of the stock market has not materialised. Mr Ken Kaname, man- aging director at Yamazaki Mazak, says the sluggish orders reflect slower economic growth. While higher capital costs had yet to affect demand, \"it will defi- nitely be a problem\". Makino Milling Machine, which specialises in machining centres and electrodischargers - electronic cutting devices - tries to put on a bold face. The company has projected an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y8.9bn on a 1.8 per cent decline in sales to Y61bn. Makino says that the labour shortage is one boon for demand as the lack of plant workers is forcing manufactur- ers to look for labour-saving factory automation. The June employment statis- tics show that there are 43 per cent more job vacancies than applicants, and this shortage, while on a gradual ease, is expected to continue for some time. The trend of young Japanese avoiding the \"three K\" jobs - jobs that are kitanai (dirty), kitsui (difficult), and kiken (dangerous) - is also adding to staff shortages at plants. Machine tool companies are looking to automated systems machines that can run for lon- ger hours without supervision. Yamazaki Mazak says that, once demand picks up, orders will concentrate on flexible manufacturing systems, or an automated line of computer- ised numerical controlled machine tools. Companies which rely on exports, such as Mori Seiki, with 35 per cent of its sales abroad, are expecting economic recovery in the US and Europe to help business. But the majority of machine tool-makers depend heavily on domestic sales as overseas business for the industry has declined to 28 per cent of total sales, down from 41 per cent five years ago. Since machinery orders act as a leading indicator, usually running ahead six months on an economic downturn but tending to lag behind the econ- omy by half a year on an upturn, it may be some time before companies see a recov- ery in business."

   "text_content" : "IMPROVED crude oil refining margins and the enhanced per- formance of the Sasol 2 plant assisted Sasol, the synthetic fuel and chemicals company, to record significantly improved profits in the year to June 25, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Turnover rose 50 per cent to R7.56bn ($2.62bn) and operating income was 55.2 per cent higher at R1.89bn. Despite a large increase in the interest bill, due to a big acquisition, attributable income was 40 per cent higher at R1.04bn. Mr Jo Stegmann, chairman, said the company was \"extremely pleased\" with its performance and was looking forward to a \"very bright future\". Sasol is entering a new growth phase, with R3bn in capital expenditure under way and a further R2bn worth of projects being considered. The projects will mean a further shift in the group's activities from synthetic fuels to petro- chemicals. In the past year, synthetic fuels contributed some 50 per cent to profits. The feature of the year was the acquisition of the Central Energy Fund's 50 per cent stake in Sasol 3, which now becomes wholly-owned. The total value of this transaction was R2.9bn, and it accounts for the leap in the group's interest- bearing debt to R2.17bn from R416.5m. The two main reasons for the leap in profits were the increased volumes at Sasol 2 and much higher refining mar- gins before and during the Gulf war, when petroleum product prices rose substantially more than crude oil prices. Earnings per share rose 39.5 per cent to 184.7 cents and the dividend was 20 per cent higher at 71.5 cents per share.",

It was the index's sev- enth consecutive monthly rise, and its third straight month above 50 per cent, indicating an expanding economy.

   "text_content" : "THAILAND has approved a Finance Ministry proposal to set up a regulatory agency for its growing securities industry, Reuter reports from Bangkok. A cabinet spokeswoman said the proposal was part of a Securities Investment Board (SIB) bill that the government planned to push through par- ent this year. She said the SIB, modelled on the US Secu- rities and Exchange Commis- sion (SEC), would be charged with protecting small stock investors on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Finance Ministry and central bank officials involved in draft- ing the bill have said it is designed to beef up govern- ment efforts to fight insider trading and increase surveil- lance of stock manipulation. They said the wide-ranging bill introduces a regulatory framework for corporate take- overs and lays down structures of over-the-counter (OTC) and financial futures markets. The officials said the bill also provides for the launch of an equity futures and options market in Bangkok in the next few years and refines the rules covering the issuing of equity and debt instruments by pri- vate companies. Senior SET officials said a Thai futures market is likely to start trad- ing in stock index futures. A central bank official said that the bill imposes criminal penalties for both executives leaking inside corporate infor- mation and stock investors benefiting from it. He said cor- porate raiders would be required to report to the authorities their acquisition of more than a 5 per cent stake in a listed company. * SOUTH KOREA has finali- sed guidelines on the opening of its stock market to direct foreign investment. The system, which will start in January, includes several limits on foreign ownership of local stocks.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb MEXICAN COMPANIES are expected to launch a steady stream of international equity issues over the next few months, taking advantage of favourable stock market condi- tions and international inves- tors' appetite for the emerging markets in Latin America. The decision to raise equity internationally comes at a time when the Mexican stock INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES exchange is putting pressure on those companies with poor- ly-traded shares to improve their liquidity. Grupo Carso and Empaques Ponderosa are the two most recent Mexican companies to announce international offer- ings of about $250m and $65m respectively, both to be lead managed by Salomon Brothers. They are likely to be joined by Televisa, the Mexican tele- vision and publishing group, which is thought to be prepar- ing a $500m equity issue for this autumn with Goldman Sachs as global lead manager. Grupo Carso is a listed hold- ing company with interests in telecommunications, mining, manufacturing metal products, cigarettes, and the restaurant and retailing industries. It acquired 20.4 per cent of the share capital and 51 per cent of the voting shares in Telmex, the recently-privatised Mexi- can telephone monopoly, in December, and is expected to receive 1 per cent of Telmex sales in management fees. As a result of the $250m international offering, Grupo Carso will increase its share capital by about 10 per cent. The funds will be used to reduce debt and to build up shareholdings in subsidiary companies. Salomon Brothers is lead manager for the issue, with Lehman Brothers as co-lead in the US, and Barings, Lehman Brothers, and Nomura acting as co-leads in the international offering. Grupo Carso is con- trolled by its chairman, Mr Carlos Slim, and his family who together own about 70 per cent of the company. The hold- ing company has an estimated market capitalisation of $2.68bn, and reported an oper- ating profit of $153m on net sales of $1.18bn in 1990. Separately, Ponderosa Indus- trial, a Mexican forestry prod- ucts producer, is reducing its ownership of Empaques Ponde- rosa, a holding company with interests in paperboard produc- tion, through a $65m initial public offer. Half of the issue will be aimed at US investors and the remaining half at other international investors. As a result, Ponderosa Indus- trial's holding in Empaques Ponderosa will be reduced from 100 per cent to between 61 and 64 per cent. An estimated 85 per cent of the proceeds will be used by Ponderosa Indus- trial and the remainder by Empaques Ponderosa. Empaques Ponderosa reported net earnings of $12.6m on revenues of $67.1m in 1990. Salomon Brothers and Bear Steams are lead managers for the issue.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick HNarvearaon in New York UBS SECURITIES, the US subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland, said yesterday that it had uncovered an \"iso- lated trading irregularity\" in its New York fixed-income trading department. In a short statement, UBS said that the relevant authori- ties had been notified of the irregularity, and that \"reme- dial action\" within the firm had been taken. The company, which is a primary dealer in US government securities, said neither clients nor UBS itself had been financially harmed. Although no further infor- mation was available from UBS, it is believed the irregu- larity did not involve a trader in Treasury securities, and that the matter was not linked to investigations into the US bond markets by regulatory authorities in the wake oa the Salomon Brothers scandal, in which the group admitted forg- lag orders and violating Trem- sury rules in auctimns of new gourament securities.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawith in Johannesburg FOREIGN investors will soon be able to trade on the South African Futures Exchange (Safex) through the financial rand, thus allowing them to enter the market for a lower capital outlay. This follows the Reserve Bank's authorisation of the request made last year by Safex. The decision, which should take effect in two to three months, is expected to boost liquidity on Safex and perhaps also on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) if the ability to hedge exposure on futures encourages investors to invest in the underlying stocks too. Mr Stuart Rees, Safex chief executive, said it could also be expected that \"an input of fresh viewpoints, strategies and skills will enliven the South African market\". The financial rand is a fixed pool of investment currency, which only foreigners may trade in. Its function is to pro- tect the balance of payments by preventing capital outflows from South Africa. The sinan- cial rand trades at a discount to the commercial rand - cur- rently about 12.5 per cent, although it has been as high as 50 per cent. To date, the flnancial rand has been used primarily for the purchase of listed shares or gilts on the JSE, as well as for property investment. Mr Rees said the Reserve Bank's dedc sion represented the accep tance that the derivative must be in the same currency as the underlying instrument. Mr Rees said the interest on margin deposits would proba- bly be paid in commercial rand. \"This means that the overseas investor in South African futures will be able to finance his investment rela- tively inexpensively with the financial rand discount for a favourable return on his money.\" In order to control the cur- rency flowing through the financial rand mechanism into futures, Safex will standardise all amounts involved, includ- ing the interest and commis- sions. Commission of about US$32 will be charged for a standard lot size of 10 equity futures contracts. Daily trade volumes on the Safex futures market, which opened a year ago, stand at over 3,000 contracts a day, mainly in index futures. Safex is also examining the addition of options to its product range by early 1992."

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb OLD MUTUAL, South Africa's largest life insurance company, is due to launch the first South African investment company with a London stock exchange listing. The steady pace of political reform in South Africa has awakened interest among international institutions in investing in the country. Smith New Court Securities, which is sponsoring and under- writing the placement, said that a poll of 110 UK institu- tions revealed that while 25 per cent already invest directly in South African equities, 45 per cent are changing their views on South African investment as a result of recent political changes. In spite of South Africa's gradual international rehabili- tation, ethical investors may still baulk at buying shares with South African links. \"Our contacts with ethical investors suggest that people do not feel the time is right to invest there yet,\" says Mr Peter Webster, executive secre- tary of Ethical Investment Research Service, a company which screens individual UK companies for involvement in various fields including South African interests. The $50m closed-end Old Mutual South Africa Fund will provide institutions with an opportunity to invest in South African blue chip shares as well as \"other well-managed companies which have been identified as offering exciting growth potential\". The mini- mum investment is $10,000.",

   "text_content" : "By Sinmon London BANKS participating in a planned Eurobond issue for South Africa risk losing the business of two of the biggest borrowers in the international bond market - Province of Ontario and Ontario Hydro. The two borrowers have raised $5bn equivalent from Eurobond and global bond offerings since December last year. Both have a policy of exclu- ding from their bond syndi- cates any bank \"which has participated in underwriting new loans to the Republic of South Africa or any of its agen- cies\". Ms Standard Tychsen, direc- tor of finance policy at the Province, said yesterday that the policy was unchanged and not under review. In particular, the Province's close relationship with Deut- sche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, could be at risk. The South African govern- ment said last week that it was \"engaged in exploratory discus- sions with Deutsche Bank regarding the replacement of a DM200m bond issue\" which falls due later this year. Hence, Deutsche Bank could be excluded from participation in Ontario or Ontario Hydro bond issues if the Republic of South Africa issue goes ahead. Deutsche Bank was the lead manager on the Province of Ontario's last bond issue, a CS500m deal launched in June. It was also a participant in Ontario Hydro's global bond offerings. A Province of Ontario offi- cial commented that the Deut- sche Bank had kept it \"fully appraised of the situation in regard to South Africa with full and frank communication on both sides\". * SOUTH KOREA'S second largest carmaker, Kia Motor, plans to sell $100m of deposi- tory receipts in the US and London, Reuter reports from Seoul. It will be the third deposi- tory receipt issue by a South Korean firm and Kia's first overseas issue. Lucky Securities will lead manage the issue which is niannned for mid-November _Â·~ I Â· ~ I ~ ~ t Â· nn Pfr iNv .",

   "text_content" : "By Suimson Lion THE PACE of new issue activity in -the International bond market Jbegan to plc up yesterday following the sum- mer lull, with borrowers taking advantage of currency and NTERNATIONAL BONDS _ interest rate swaps opportuni- ties in the Canadian dollar and sterling sectors of the market. Osaka Gas and Toyota Motor Credit launched C200m five-year and C$150m four-year deals respectively, lead man- aged by Goldman Sachs and Wood Gundy. The Canadian dollar market continues to generate buying interest from investors, much of it driven by heavy redemp- tions of existing bonds. In Sep- tember and October, C$2.6bn of outstanding bonds fall due for redemption. Both deals fared well, with the Toyota deal tightening from an initial yield spread of 41 basis points over Canadian dollar paper to 32 basis points by the close. The Osaka Gas deal tight- ened from an initial spread of 71 basis points to 69 basis points. AsfMin, the Austrian state- backed road finance agency, had also been expected to issue in the Canadian dollar sector but instead launched a Â£100m 10-year deal lead managed by UBS Phillips & Drew. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating rate yen, a rare currency swap opportunity out of the UK cur- rency. The paper carries a cou- pon of 10% per cent and was priced to yield 38 basis points over gilts, on the basis of a top triple-A credit rating. Woolwich Building Society became the latest UK mutual savings institution to borrow in fixed-rate sterling rather than by issuing floating rate notes, the traditional funding path. The Â£100m five-year deal launched yesterday, lead man- aged by Hambros, pays a cou- pon of 11 per cent and was priced to yield 80 basis points over UK government bonds. Meanwhile, National Bank of Hungary launched its Ecu200m five-year deal, lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The deal will be priced later this week to yield between 12% per cent and 12% per cent - the highest yielding paper in the sector. Hungary does not have the largest external debt burden in Eastern Europe. At $20bn, its foreign debt is only half that of Poland. But the country has a population just one quarter the size of Poland, and its per capita debt burden is the highest of all the countries in the former Soviet bloc. Add to this the state of near civil war in neighbouring Yugoslavia and political tur- moil in the Soviet Union: there are many reasons to be cau- tious. Yet Hungary has never defaulted on its external debt and remain considered one of the best improving credits in the region. The deal drew comparisons with the Ecu400m seven year deal launched by Greece, also through CSFB, in May. Yester- day Greece was trading on a yield of 10.4 per cent with the Hungary paper offering a yield pick up of around 170 basis points."

   "text_content" : "By Grog Hutchinson in Manila and Stephen Fidler in London THE PHILIPPINES requires a minimum $640m from interna- tional financial institutions and foreign governments to support a debt restructuring accord agreed with its leading creditor banks. The funds are needed chiefly to provide collateral sufficient to guarantee principal and interest on the concessional bonds for which banks will be asked to exchange their loans. The figure was provided to journalists in the Philippines by the central bank governor, Mr Jose Cuisia. There are concerns among bankers and others, however, that insufficient funding may be available to allow the deal to go through. The main risk would be the failure to obtain ratification of the agreement which allows the US to retain a military presence in the Philippines after September 16, after which date the Americans are sup- posed to begin an orderly with- drawal. The agreement is sac- ing strong opposition in the Philippine senate. \"It's proba- bly unlikely we would get resources required to close the deal if there's no ratification,\" said Mr Cuisia. The treaty's ratification directly opens the way for funds from the US Treasury that can be used for debt relief. The US will also be influential in securing funding from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the Japanese government. Formal approval of the debt package is also contingent upon two things: the country, notably its zealous senators, agreeing to treat the debt of a controversial and allegedly cor- rupt nuclear power plant like any other debt paper; and the Philippines success - now in some doubt - in complying with an IMF economic stabilis- ation programme. The deal is the first under the Brady plan, which includes as an option a co-financing with one of the international development banks. Banks may opt to lend money through a co-financing with the Asian Development Bank, which provides a con- duit for commercial bank loans to the Philippines. This may encourage Japanese banks, which otherwise would be reluctant, to lend \"new money\" to the Philippines. This, in turn, will reduce the danger that the money will run out to fund collateral needed to back the concessional bonds taken by those lenders not lending new money. Many traditional bank lend- ers will in any case be unwill- ing to make new loans. How- ever, there are some holders of Philippine debt - including some more innovative interna- tional investors - who believe that the \"new money\" option will provide the best return to lenders. The agreement with repre- sentatives of the country's creditor banks, led by Manu- facturers Hanover of the US, could, according to central bank calculations, yield more than $2.3bn in fresh funds and debt relief over the next six years and reduce the nation's $29bn foreign debt by about $1.5bn. Applicable commercial debt totals $5.3bn of medium to long-term loans.",

   "text_content" : "By David Buhan in Brussels THE EUROPEAN Commission said yesterday that it was buy- ing 45,000 tonnes of surplus Hungarian wheat to give to food-short Albania. This is the first such \"trian- gular\" operation in the Euro- pean Community's aid pro- gramme for eastern Europe, in which Brussels has decided to use the surplus in one Eastern European country to meet the deficit in another. Past proposals by the com- mission to buy eastern Euro- pean food to meet the much greater food needs of the Soviet Union have foundered in the Council of Ministers, in which a majority of EC govern- ments have insisted that the Ecu250m (Â£175m) of EC food aid pledged to the Soviet Union should come out of EC stocks. This will finance about 84,000 tonnes of food, of which some 5,000 tonnes have already been dispatched. Commission officials said they were unsure whether the Albanian operation could be used as a precedent for aid packages elsewhere. It was only possible because the EC executive could act on its own authority to take the Ecu5m cost of the Hungarian wheat out of money already approved for Hungary under the commu- nity's aid programme for east- ern Europe. The commission has a stand- ing request for approval by EC governments and the European Parliament for 50,000 tonnes of food for Albania, and it announced yesterday it was raising this request to 100,000 tonnes. The officials said Albania was desperately short of food, needing some 50,000 tonnes of bread-making wheat a month until the next harvest in mid- 1992 to maintain adequate lev- els of consumption. Consider- able amounts of aid have been pledged by Italy, which is anx- ious to keep Albanian refugees out. But the capacity of Albania's ports was very lim- ited, officials said, and the great advantage of the Hungar- ian wheat was that it could be delivered almost immediately by rail.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn GERMAN FARMERS set new records for grain production this summer. The harvest rose by 2.4 per cent to 38.5m tonnes despite cuts in the area under cultivation and a substantial drop in yields in the former East Germany. Surplus sup- plies put further downward pressure on prices, the food ministry said. Lower market prices and ris- ing input costs had resulted in a 25 per cent drop in western farmers' incomes over the past two years, the ministry added, and new season cereal prices were already between DM1 (34p) and DM2 a tonne lower than last year's. Almost 28m tonnes of the total harvest came from the west, where 500,000 fewer hect- ares than last year were sown - a reduction of 0.9 per cent. However, a 7 per cent surge in yields to 62 quintals (100 kg each) a hectare more than com- pensated for the cuts. The area under grain in the east fell almost 17 per cent and yields per hectare dropped by more than 6 per cent to 53 quintals. Next year, according to official estimates, German cereal growers are expected to reduce plantings by a further 500,000 hectares. 0 A big decline in sowings of quality bread-making wheat in the UK has led to a wide pre- mium emerging over feed wheat this year. The Home Grown Cereals Authority said yesterday that, while there were as yet no fig- ures for the total harvest, seed certification figures showed that only 21 per cent of the total area sown to wheat this year was of bread-making qual- ity, compared with 30.5 per cent last year and 41 per cent the year before. This year's UK harvest is expected to total around 15m tonnes. Milling quality wheat for delivery in September in East Anglia has fetched Â£139.50 a tonne, compared with Â£113.75 for feed wheat, the authority said. However, since the har- vest started, the premium has begun to fall as quality appears better than was expected. Farmers expect a fair pre- mium for bread-making wheat, as the yields on such high-pro- tein varieties are lower. In the last couple of years the pre- mium has fallen as low as Â£3 to Â£4 a tonne.",

   "text_content" : "MARKET REPORT Nickel prices closed just ahead of nine-month lows struck earlier on the LME. Dealers said the losses were prompted by the recent breakdown below $8,000 a tonne for three-month metal as well as a 492-tonne rise in LME nickel stocks to a two-month high of 7,224 tonnes. Expectations that demand from stainless-steel mills will be below levels seen earlier this year are likely to keep the market under pressure, although further price falls could result in production cuts, they said.

This helped the market to shrug off news that LME stocks rose by 3,800 tonnes to 307,050. On the bullion market silver and platinum moved ahead. Dealers said that silver had broken into its previous 390-400 cents a troy ounce range, with previous resistance at 390 now tentative support. Platinum advanced in the wake of an overnight short-covering rally in Tokyo and a shift in sentiment towards the view that the white metal might now recover to parity with gold.

The two countries hope to form a unified stance to pres- ent to the meeting of the Inter- national Coffee Organisation in London on the September 28. Mr Jorge Cardenas, presi- dent of the National Coffee Federation of Colombia, said his country would receive fin- ancing for the scheme through American banks. It is still uncertain where Brazil will obtain the funds. According to the coffee market here, Fun- cafe, the government coffee agency, will offer some financ- ing, and the private sector will provide the rest",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "ARLY THIS year Mr Maurice Cartwright from Matlock, Derby- shire, bought a Siberian coal mine,.thus becoming the first West- erner to own a Soviet mine. Last Friday he exported his first cargo of coal to Japan and by 1992, he estimates, he will have made a total profit of 22m. It all began in January, when Mr Cartwright, a coal engineer who set up his own business three years ago, found himself in Siberia. \"A Muscovite inter- mediary tipped me off,\" he says, but he expected nothing more than some con- sultancy work, hisusual line of busi- ness. Making his way to the snow-bound mine, known as Polosukhinskaya, deep in the heart of Soviet coal mining coun- try in western Siberia, Mr Cartwright met Mr Igor Aladun, the mine's manag- ing director. \"I turned up at their door. I didn't know they wanted a Western partner, I thought they wanted an engineering consultant. Talks developed, and I real- ised that they did want a partner.\" Three months and several meetings later, the British Siberian Coal Com- pany, or Britsico, was born. In July, it was fully registered as a 6040 UK-Soviet joint venture - number 290. The UK partners are Mr Cartwright, Mr Heinz Stolting of the Swiss coal marketing company Trico AG, and their accountant. The Soviet partners are the local ministry, the local railway, the mine's managers and its 1,900 workers, Il shareholders. They have owned the mine as leaseholders since 1990, when the local ministry handed it over to the management to run under a private Most of the $9m capital being put into the venture by Mr Cartwright will be spent on modern mining equipment, including the first long wall system in the Soviet Union. The potential of the mine is consider- able. It 's set in perhaps the richest coal .iinf basin In the world, an urea the MotHungary known as the Kuzbass Basin with reserves of 4A0m tonnes, the mine produces 25m tonnes of high quality coking coal a year. Mr Cart- wriht a will double that by 19. He will then sell the coal on the world market, for dollars. Of the total production, 1.8m tonnes to fill a state quota, but the balance can be transported by rail to Odessa, where it is loaded onto ships. \"The main problem is the infrastruc- ture, the railway,\" Mr Cartwright says. \"There's nothing we can do about that.\" Apart from that, he seems untroubled by recent events in the Soviet Union, although he admits to having some sleepless nights a week ago. One of the mine's directors, Mr Yurl Gerold, is close to Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, and was with him during the upheaval. Mr Cartwright, whose last two jobs were recovering coal from lakes in Swe- den and improving procedures for load- ing coal onto ships in Venezuela and Colombia, is something of a cool cus- tomer. His ambitions do not end with Polo- sukhinskaya. He has also personally bought Burzass, an opencast pit produc- ing 1.4m tonnes of steam coal, about 300 km (180 miles) away. \"It will come on stream in 1992, and I can double its output,\" he says.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Howard Schiswl EQUATORIAL GUINEA is set to become in October the new- est member of the West Afri- can oil producers' league with the coming on stream of the offshore Alba gasicondensates field, the first time such a dis- covery is developed in Africa. Initially, however, only the condensates in the Alba field will be exploited, production is to start at the rate of 2,000 bar- rels a day (b/d), moving up by the mid-1990s to the 4,000-5,000 b/d range. The Alba field, boasting reserves of 42m barrels of con- densates and 850m cubic feet of gas, was discovered in the mid- 1990s by Spain's Repsol. In 1990, a group of American independents led by Texas- based Walter International took over the licence area, located north of Bioko island close to the maritime boundary with Cameroon and Nigeria. To date, only scant explora- tion has taken place in the country despite the fact that it is at the very heart of the Gulf of Guinea, a proven hydrocar- bons province. Holding back exploration work was the belief among oil men that Equatorial Guinea's continental plateau tended to be gas-prone. However, certain specialists now reckon that drilling deeper structures could yield more rewarding results. Indeed, deeper formations on the Alba block will be Walter's target in 1993 when it is scheduled to drill a wildcat well. Other exploration plans in this former Spanish colony involve acreage offshore in Rio Muni enclave, wedged in between Cameroon and Gabon.",

Initial output from the NKrlObn (Â£870m) platform is estimated at about 40,000 bar- rels a day but is expected to achieve design capacity of 110,000 bid within the next two months. In May Norway produced a record 1.96m barrels a day but that was reduced sharply dur- ing summer platform mainte- nance programmes. Oseberg C is 14 km (8.5 miles) north of. the main Ose- berg platform which produces 320,000 barrels a day of crude. When the C platform achieves full production, the Oseberg field will overtake the Gullfaks field which produces 360,000 barrels of crude oil a day, and will become Norway's second biggest producer after Statoford, which pumps about 750,000 barrels a day. Pressure maintenance in the reservoir to boost crude oil out- put is helped by re-injection of the gas from Oseberg C.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent SOVIET METAL exports to the west, which have risen very sharply in the past year, may have peaked, suggests Mr Jon Bergtheil, analyst with the James Capel financial services group. He argues that, if the Soviet Union is given access to more western credit as a result of the failed coup, \"the focus of attention is likely to swing back to downstream produc- tion within the Soviet Union rather than the present empha- sis on pushing as much raw material as possible across the borders in the chase for foreign exchange\". Mr Bergtheil, in Capel's International Mining Review, suggests that Soviet metal exports have increased \"simply because the state has managed to make the maintenance of metal production a priority while internal usage of down- stream metal products has col- lapsed along with the econ- omy\". Meanwhile, he points out, most Soviet smelting and resin- ing capacity has been deterior- ating while the finance required for expansion has been limited. The Soviet Union also has starved its satellite and associate states (such as Cuba) of many raw materials during the past few years, pre- ferring to sell its product to the west in exchange for \"mean- ingful money\". Mr Bergtheil recalls that Soviet exports of the most heavily-traded metals - cop- per, aluminium and nickel - have risen substantially. Copper exports have jumped from 30,000 tonnes in 1966 to 180,000 tonnes last year and were running at an annual rate of 230,000 tonnes in the first half of 1991. Aluminium exports were up from 170,000 tonnes to 270,000 tonnes and were at an annual rate of 520,000 tonnes in the first half while nickel exports rose from 35,000 tonnes to 78,000 tonnes over the same period and in the first six months of this year were at an annual rate of 120,000 tonnes. He says the economic recov- ery of the Soviet Union will almost certainly be a long and slow process. But the Soviet Union will have to divert raw materials from exports to local production if it is to provided adequate living standards for its people. He adds: \"It is possible we have now seen the worst excesses of Soviet metal dump- ing in the west and that this phase will dovetail perfectly with the revival of western economies, driving metal demand to such a point where the recent stock build-up is reversed.\" 0 About 10,000 tonnes of Soviet nickel is in Rotterdam being cut into sizes suitable for delivery to London Metal Exchange registered ware- houses, traders say. If there were customers for the metal it would not have to be cut and therefore it is likely to be moved gradually into LME stocks, they suggest. The problem stems from a relaxation of state controls enabling Soviet nickel produc- ers to sell directly to world markets. This has caused many sales agencies to spring up and some lack foreign trade experience, they add. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, says the market has already taken account of the Soviet nickel in Rotterdam. He says: \"It should not push prices any lower.\""

In addition, OECD policies 'Increase world price variabil- ity by around 15 to 30 per cent, in particular by shifting the burden of adjustment to world shocks onto other countries and exporting domestic shocks to the world market\". Support is given mainly through high domestic market prices, which also helps pro- ducers of alternative sweeten- ers, the OECD points out. \"By encouraging the development of substitutes to sugar, policies contribute to lower sugar con- sumption levels, lower returns to sugar producers and higher costs of policy operation, and therefore pose a threat to the sustainabllity of the policies themselves in their current form.\" World trade has been low- ered and distorted, the report suggests. Two studies have estimated developing country exports to be about 3.5m tonnes lower than they would otherwise have been. Changes to OECD countries' policies \"will be necessary if market signals are to play a greater role in allocating resources in the world sugar market\", the report concludes.

   "text_content" : "I In an effort to build up domestic dominance before looking outside their own borders, Dutch financial institutions have embarked on an impressive series of mergers which have transformed the country's financial world leaving a small but powerful group of operators, writes Ronald van de Krol THE normally slow-paced world of Dutch finance has changed beyond all recognition in the space of a single year. A dizzying round of mergers and consolidation has left the Netherlands with a handful of big operators who, will need to look abroad for future growth and acquisitions.. The first of the financial mega-deals was the merger of the country's two largest banks, Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (Amro Bank) and Alge- mene Bank Nederland (ABN Bank), which took place in September last year. This transaction was swiftly followed only two months later by the surprise news that Nat- ionale-Nederlande, the leading Dutch insurer, was to merge with NMB Postbank, the coun- try's third-biggest bank which was still struggling to carry out a merger that had created it in the first place. The link-up of Nat-Ned and NMB Postbank to create the Internationale Nederlanden group was made possible by changes in Dutch regulations which had previously barred insurers and banks from own- ing more than 15 per cent of each other's share capital. Although relative latecomers to the concept of Allfinanz or bancassurance - the German and French terms, respec- tively, for banking-insurance partnerships - Dutch banks and insurers have taken to the concept of \"financial supermar- kets\" with all the enthusiasm of the newly converted. In fact, unlike many bank- ing-insurance partnerships in the UK, Germany and France, which involve cross-holdings of minority stakes, the Dutch have preferred to conclude full mergers rather than opting for a looser form of alliance. Among recent examples in the current bout of consolida- tion has been Rabobank's acquisition of the insurer Inter- polis, as well as the full merger between Amev, the third-larg- est Dutch insurer, and VSB, the Netherlands' largest savings bank group. (Amev/ VSB later merged with the Bel- gian insurer AG to create the Fortis group). All in all, 1990/1991 has proven to be the most eventful period in Dutch finance since 1963/1964, when the original ABN, Amro and Nat-Ned were created through an equally extensive series of mergers. The past year's transactions between ABN and Amro and between Nat-Ned and NMB Postbank are by far the largest mergers in Dutch corporate history. The two mergers have cre- ated a powerful concentration of financial strength which in many other countries would have been more difficult to achieve because of stronger anti-monopolistic traditions. Between them, ABN and Amro have about half of the corporate banking market, although their share of retail banking is far lower at around 15 per cent. Together, they and their sub- sidiaries also account for at least 40 per cent of all trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Internationale _ Â·-. Â· . ~ i ... ;. . . :, -I... Â·ri Â· .< ,, .rs Nederlanden is by far the larg- est shareholder in the Nether- lands, owning stakes of 5 per cent or more in virtually every important bourse-listed com- pany. The new bank ABN Amro, which ranks among the 10 larg- est in Europe, has made clear from the start that it wants to grow abroad by acquisition. So far, it has bolstered its existing presence in New York and Chi- cago through smaller pur- chases, but it has yet to make the big banking acquisition at which it hinted in mid-1990. Internationale Nederlanden, which claims to be the second most profitable financial insti- tution in Europe after Banco de Bilbao y Viscaya of Spain, has also said that it will con- centrate on banking when it is ready to start making interna- tional acquisitions. At the top of its priority list are wholesale and merchant banking, fol- lowed by retailing banking and insurance. Despite the flurry of activity, not all of the Netherlands' pre- mier financial institutions have taken the merger route. Rabobank, which, as a co-oper- ative bank, is not bourse-listed, has chosen to conclude co-operation accords with a number of foreign banks such as Lloyds Bank of the UK, Credit Agricole of France and Banco Popular of Spain. In insurance, Aegon, which was highly critical of the Nat- Ned/NMB Postbank merger, has said that it will not merge with a bank, although it has not ruled out partial co-opera- tion with a banking partner. Unlike the series of US bank- ing mergers announced during the summer, both the ABN Amro and Internationale Nederlanden mergers were not motivated primarily by a desire to cut costs. And, unlike the US institutions, the Dutch merger partners were also not seeking to solve problems caused by poorly-performing loans: all four were conserva- tively managed and all pos- sessed good quality assets. Instead, the driving force behind the merger trend has been the desire to consolidate and strengthen domestic domi- nance as a prelude to expected expansion abroad, especially in Europe. This pattern of big domestic link-ups is a far cry from the \"Euro-euphoria\" of the late 1980s, when the buzzword of Dutch finance was the cross- border partnership, exempli- fied best by Amro Bank's plans to merge with G6ndrale de Banque of Belgium. This bi-na- tional merger, billed as a first for European banking, fell through, and Amro's later deci- sion to merge instead with ABN is indicative of the new emphasis on sewing up national markets before embarking on cross-border expansion. In this sense, both the ABN Amro and Internationale Nederlanden mergers have come to be regarded as strongly defensive moves, motivated in part by the wish to deny foreign competitors the chance to steal into the open Dutch marketplace and wrest away further banking and insurance business. In the case of Internationale Nederlanden, the marriage between Nat-Ned and NMB Postbank was a way for the Netherlands' biggest insurer to ensure that it gained full con- trol over NMB Postbank's extensive distribution outlets, which encompass the more than 400 branches of NMB Bank and the 2,500 Dutch post offices used by the Postbank. This network is a potentially lucrative channel for selling Nat-Ned's insurance policies to the Dutch public. Allfinanz has not existed long enough in the Nether- lands to draw firm conclusions (1 Â· Â· Dam Square, found between Amnterdam'a soc excnange ana option excnange .i, r ..:Â·nÂ·Â· iÂ· ii :~Â·~Â·' Â·Â·Â·,Â· ~,, 1`';*31Â·.1.Â·1Â·Â·:: : Â·Â·Â· Â· Â· i~Â· :Â·Â·.

But there is little doubt that the arrival of banking-insur- ance groups has fundamentally reshaped the Netherlands' financial community. Among those most immedi- ately affected are independent Dutch insurance intermedi- aries, who distribute 45 per cent of all the insurance poli- cies written every year in the Netherlands. Many intermedi- aries were severely critical of Nat-Ned's plans to harness NMB Postbank's outlets, and the Association of Independent Insurance Agents - one of two important groups of insurance intermediaries - has called on its members to boycott the company. Despite this opposition, it is clear that AUfinanz is in the Netherlands to stay, bringing with it far-reaching changes for consumers, banks, insurers and brokers alike."

With one third of all Dutch companies doing business with Rabobank. Today, with total assets of more than US $ 115 billion, Rabobank is one of the top 50 banks in the world, with offices in major financial centres and ports around the globe.

   "text_content" : "RABOBANK, the large cooperative bank, likes to see itself as a bit of an outsider. The bank feels it has no need to follow the crowd. So Rabo, ensconced in its new Utrecht headquarters, has been unruffled by the momentous changes going on in the Dutch banking scene. In the space of two years it saw its main four competitors reduced to two through mergers. Since then Rabo has become the second largest bank in asset terms in the country. Rabo and ABN Amro together now have a strong grip on the Dutch market. So it is not as if the bank has been left empty-handed and wishing as if it had acted earlier. On the contrary, Rabo's chairman Mr Herman WiUffels feels all this merger activity will have more advantages than disadvantages for Rabo. Most corporate clients like to have two advisers. Because of the ABN Amro merger clients have to find an alternative. \"The client's choice has become so much smaller that we are often a natural choice next to ABN Amro,\" says Mr Wljffels. Another advantage is that the competitors are busy getting their act together. \"In the meantime we can spend our time develop- ing new business,\" says Mr Wljffels. But this relaxed attitude does not mean that Rabo has been standing still. It has moved from being a largely domestic agri- cultural bank to being an international all-rounder with specific expertise in the global agri-business. Last year the bank purchased a medi- um-sized insurer, Interpolis, immediately after the regulations that kept insurers and banks apart were changed. At the end of last year it signed a co-operation con- tract with Robeco, one of the largest inde- pendent fund management groups in Europe. The bank has also set up agree- ments with Britain's Lloyds Bank, Spanish Banco Popular and France's Credit Agri- cole. These co-operation agreements allow Rabo customers to use the branch net- works of the foreign banks. It might appear as if Rabo were pur- posely avoiding mergers in the banking sector. Mr Wijffels denies any strategic decision to keep out of the way of straight mergers but points to a lack of possibili- ties. \"Most of the time the potential candi- dates are either too expensive or bad qual- ity.\" Also, the co-operative structure of the bank makes mergers with other banks nearly impossible. Rabo has been a Johnny-come-lately to the international banking scene. This is largely because its internationalisation has followed its domestic clients abroad. The goal has been to provide services to its Dutch business clients in those coun- tries that are most important to Dutch trade. But there has to be a balance between where and what clients would like to do and potential profits or losses. Mr Wijffels points to Japan. Many times, partly because of its agrarian client base, the bank looked at possibilities in Japan and i Ã½ . - - - 1 Â· Herman Wjlliels: merger activity will benefit the bank discarded the plans. A profitable situation seemed too difficult to achieve. In general, however, Rabo wants to be present in all the important financial capi- tals in Europe, because that is where the clients need most help. Most foreign branches are quite profitable according to Mr Wijffels. \"It is difficult to do well abroad. The reason why we were relatively successful is because we always maintain a good synergy between head office and branch, put people we trust in charge of the branches, and focus the business nar- rowly on what we are good at at home.\" So Rabo kept clear of junk bonds and compli- cated financial engineering while it stuck largely to business that was related to agri-business. Rabo's triple-A rating is now so rare that it reinforces the \"outsider\" image in the international financial community. But the top rating also helps international development. Who would not want to do a deal with one of the few triple-A rated banks? The bank is relatively confident it can hold on to this rating, \"but you never know what can happen,\" says Mr Wijffels. \"If the general level in international bank- ing keeps dropping eventually we will be affected too.\" But net profits grew by 8 per cent in 1990 while the profits of its direct competi- tors fell by around the same amount. Pre- dictions are that earnings growth will slow this year as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown and continuous cost increases. If Rabo was originally the bank of farm- ers, agri-business companies and small and medium-sized businesses, it is now also trying its luck among the larger prey. The bank has a full-scale wholesale bank located within the head office with a money and capital markets division and a corporate division with some merchant banking activities. Rabo was also a latecomer to securities. The bank was in some ways acting as a savings bank. \"In the 80s we realised that savers turned into investors. That was one of the reasons why we linked up with Robeco,\" says Mr Wiffels. Rabo is now a good example of the Allfinanz concept. The Rabo saver can now put his savings as just as easily into life insurance as securi- ties. Mr Wijffels sees the large 2,200 branch network as a strength rather than a liabil- ity. To him it is an excellent distribution channel for insurance, banking and invest- ment products. However, the branch net- work will need to be thinned out in the next couple of years. Based on its domestic dominance through its retail network - the bank holds 40 per cent of the savings deposits, 25 per cent of the home mortgages, 40 per cent of financing market for small- and medium-sized businesses and 90 per cent of lending to the agricultural sector - Rabobank can successfully hold on to the quiet confidence of an outsider.

A country which always had and will have to adopt an international perspective. A country where English is almost the official second language. Where business and trade nearly always mean contact with other countries. For Dutch companies, running into the risks of doing business with international trading partners is not a sudden necessity occasioned by the pressure of 1992. Rather it represents a fact of business life, the origin of which goes back some four centuries. By definition a credit insurance company in a (small) country such as the Netherlands has to have optimal international information. It has to be decisive and fast on its feet so as to be able to adapt flexibly to international economic conditions that can sometimes change overnight. A credit insurance company which has grown up in such a country has an unsurpassed ability to think European and act European. The Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij of the world's largest credit insurance companies. Located on one of Amsterdam's canals, where you can still sense the entrepreneurship of the seventeenth century merchants,the NCM is now an extremely modern and sophisticated company. A company which offers its domestic and foreign clients the possibility of a computer terminal link to the NCM databank. With the obvious benefits of rapid decision-making and fast action. A company which also gained a lot of ex- perience working for a considerable number of multinationals and large concerns. And which there- fore offers a highly varied range of international credit insurance facilities. With cover that can be tailored to the exact requirements of the individual company. The NCM has been ready for 1992 for quite some time now. And the sum of all this is that for example a British businessman doing business with Germany (or any other European country) and the NCM can substantially reduce his worries.

   "text_content" : "UNTIL January 1990, banks and Insurance companies in the Netherlands were sepa- raited by the Central Bank's structural supervision policy, under which banks and insur- ers were forbidden to hold more than a 15 per cent stake in each other's companies, with a 5 per cent limit on vot- ing rights. The removal of this obstacle, the forthcoming disappearance of EC borders and the accom- panying threat of increased international competition helped spur the current wave of consolidation and banking/ insurance mergers. In addition, Dutch compa- nies' desire to maintain their independence has encouraged them to seek merger or alli- ance partners. The Dutch industry has also been scram- bling to catch up with the trend in several other Euro- pean countries, where banks and insurers have been moving closer to each other for some years. A survey last year by Arthur Anderson among 420 directors of insurance companies in 15 European countries concluded that the European-wide move- ment would peak in 1993-5, with banks capturing 20 per cent or more of the European insurance market. Respon- dents predicted that the Netherlands, with its open, deregulated market, was among countries likely to attract more foreign interest and acquirers, especially as the 150 foreign insurers active in the Netherlands now hold only about 10 per cent of the mar- ket. First off the mark last year were insurer Amev and bank- ing group Verenigde Spaar- bank, which had taken 5 per cent crossholdings ahead of deregulation with the stated intention of merging when this was permitted. It was also the first group to link up with a cross-border partner, Belgian insurer AG. The group, which has been named Fortis, has the same structure as the Royal Dutch/ Shell group, except that Amev and AG are 50/50 partners. In May last year, the co-oper- ative bank Rabobank took over insurer Interpolis and also linked up with investment fund group Robeco, completing its version of the Allfinanz con- cept, according to Rabobank chief Mr erman Wiiffels. Last August's marriage between ABN and Amro Bank, one of the two Dutch mega- mergers, did not involve an insurer, although Amro Bank has its own insurance operations. NMB-Postbank, the country's third-largest bank, completed its controversial mega-merger with insurer Nat- ionale-Nederlanden to form Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) on March 3 after overcoming strong opposition from a group of shareholders led by rival insurer Aegon, the only important Dutch insurer which has so far failed to find a banking partner. A partnership with an insurer such as Nat-Ned vastly increases NMB-Postbank's financial clout, as Nat-Ned's solvency ratios are much higher than those of NMB-Post- bank. This in turn can facili- tate faster expansion abroad, particularly in services to com- panies and investment banks. The domestic market has been slowly changing shape for years, one key development being Robeco's introduction of the Roparco giro savings scheme a decade ago. Operat- ing without branches, it could offer competitive interest rates, sharpening up growing compe- tition for \"free\" (non-contrac- tual) savings. Since then, many new higher interest rate savings products, such as the private time deposit account, have been introduced, moving interest rates closer to money and capital market rates. Even before 1990, the tradi- tional strict separation between Dutch savings banks, lending banks, insurers and independent insurance brokers had become blurred. An indus- try survey last year showed that 98 per cent of independent brokers were active in mort- gage business and 85 per cent arranged personal loans. An ABN Amro report, \"Europe 1992 and the Dutch banking sector\", concluded that competition between domestic suppliers of financial services would hot up further, with the stress on capital man- agement and savings and investment products. This is because the age profile of the Dutch population is gradually rising, while the economy is expected to continue to show steady, it moderate, growth. For the banks, a key factor has been the shifting savings market structure towards instruments such as life insur- ance, while other growth opportunities such as corpo- rate banking have come under threat as big international companies expand their trea- sury department in-house banking activities. In countries such as France, Germany and the UK, banks have been successful in increasing their share of the life insurance market, with French banks now capturing more than half of new life busi- ness. Rabobank's alliance part- ner Credit Agricole set up a life insurance subsidiary, Predi- cam, in 1987, which has since grown to become one of the top three in France. For insurers, a banking part- ner provides access to a rela- tively loyal banking customer base. Cost reductions achieved by distributing insurance prod- ucts through banks can be as high as two-thirds, according to some industry experts, with experience in other countries demonstrating that insurance agents can sell more efficiently through a bank's clientele than through \"cold\" contacts. Supervision is now being combined at group level Amev/VSB-AG management board secretary Mr Leo Lewin explains how his group has pioneered the new approach to the market. Banking and insur- ance operations continue to be managed separately, but under combined supervision at group level. Sales of insurance products by VSB are showing \"some spectacular development\", Mr Lewin says. From an insignifi- cant base, VSB is now the larg- est seller of Amev life insur- ance products, and has made an important contribution in selling fiscally-attractive single premium products. He esti- mates that about 15 per cent of total life products sales is through the banks, with VSB accounting for about 5 per cent. For sales of savings products with a banking character, he says VSB has developed two new selling lines using Amev insurance brokers. It has also agreed an office license for- mula with several firms of bro- ker, who will sell banking products for VSB while remaining free to sell for other companies, Mr Levin says. \"The general idea in the Dutch market is that insurance intermediaries increasingly want to sell other products. All products are available through all channels at the same price - that's very important,\" Mr Lewin says. For VSB, the need to become more aggressive and active in selling was already well understood before the merger. VSB is in the process of transforming itself from a savings to a commercial bank. The new groupings have come under fire from some quarters, particularly the ING merger. The independent insurance brokers, on which Nat-Ned is dependent for about 85 per cent of its domestic activities, complained bitterly about the ING deal, under which NMB-Postbank will only sell Nat-Ned insurance prod- ucts. However, independent brokers in general remain well placed to meet growing demand from increasingly sophisticated customers for expert, tailor-made advice, industry experts say. The consumers union Consu- mentenbond sent a letter to Sir Leon Brittan at the time of the ING merger expressing fears that it would lead to monopo- listic tendencies, price increases and a deterioration in the consumer's position, as well as damaging product inno- vation as tailor-made products would give way to standardisa- tion. It was also concerned that home buyers might be forced to take out an insurance com- pany with the same company as that providing their mort- gage. The combined offer of ser- vices clearly offers potential cost-savings for companies and benefits for customers, but how far customer benefits emerge in practice will depend on how comprehensive the supply of services is, and par- ticularly on adequate competi- tion, forcing suppliers in all types of combination to live up to their stated aim of becoming more client-oriented.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "LAST year the atmosphere among Amsterdam financiers was tinged with fears that their financial market - one of the oldest in the world - would be sucked up by giant competitors such as London. Today, this feeling of panic has been replaced by a calm deter- mination. The fort has to be held but there is a good chance Amsterdam will keep its place among the solid, if second-tier, world financial centres. The earlier fear served a pur- pose, however, spurring an important initiative supported by such figures as Mr Willem Duisenberg, president of De Nederlandsche Bank and Mr Ed van Thijn, mayor of the City of Amsterdam. The group produced an anal- ysis of Amsterdam's strengths and weaknesses in order to identify real opportunities. The exercise was then to enhance the traditional position of Amsterdam as an international centre for financial products and services. In March of 1989 this group issued a report which called for the implementation of more than 20 initiatives to reinforce and extend Amsterdam's com- petitive position. The foremost goal was to ensure that Amsterdam would remain in all respects attractive as a financial gateway to the Euro- pean market. An impressive agenda was set up, part of which was com- pleted by July 1990. The work was to deal with both the inhibiting factors on the mar- ket and the physical shortcom- ings of Amsterdam itself. One of the main worries of the financial community was the fact that some said as much as 80 per cent of the large guilder bond market was going through London as a result of restrictions on the Dutch market. Most of these contraints were lifted last July. For example, stamp duty on securities transactions was abolished and fixed settlement was set up. Market transparency was improved by the reporting of trades involving foreign inter- mediaries. A market making system - \"the open order book\" -was installed to increase the liquidity of the bond market. These measures were specifically tailored to bring back the market share in guilder bonds that was lost to London discount houses such as Cantor Fitzgerald. During the time when these measures were being put in place many bankers were scep- tical. It seemed too little and too late. But public financial opinion has been changing for the better and many now feel that the measures have been beneficial. According to Mr Jan Stein- hauser, director of Amsterdam Financial Centre there are still things to be done. A market making system for equities is still in the pipeline. The settle- ment system should be com- pleted with an active securities lending market. More difficult problems are being tackled, too. Amsterdam Financial Centre has commis- sioned an academic study into whether and why the price/ earnings ratio of Dutch compa- nies is much lower than in other countries - a common complaint from foreign inves- tors. If, says Mr Steinhauser, it all is a rumour it can be did- proved and if not measures can be taken to tackle the causes of the problem. Many are concerned over how successful last year's bond market-related measures have been in bringing the guilder market back to the Amsterdam stock exchange? The question is still largely unanswered and is hostage to great deal of sub- jective analysis. Nevertheless, there is some good news. The last quarterly of De Nederlandsche Bank wrote that the \"position of London with respect to the trading of Dutch government bonds has lost in importance\". The Bank admits that it does not have precise figures of guil- der bond turnover in London but many individual invest- ment bankers have admitted that a large part of the \"lost\" transactions are now being car- ried out in Amsterdam once again. The other goal of the Amsterdam Financial Centre is to promote the advantages of Amsterdam as a hub. The choice of London as a centre for the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD) was a blow to confi- dence. But all eyes now rest tentatively on the proposed European central bank or Eurofed. The hope is that Amsterdam as a location for the central bank will be seen as a good choice. According to Mr Steinhau- ser, Amsterdam has some advantages over London. The Dutch speak languages well (particularly English), the country is open-minded inter- nationally and monetary policy has had an excellent reputa- tion. Also, the fiscal climate for foreign firms is benevolent. The geographically central position of the Netherlands in Europe is an added attraction. The influx of foreign banks is steady, especially Japanese banks, which usually follow their clients, but many of which prefer living conditions in the Netherlands above those in London. On the other hand the American banks have nearly all severely cut back their Dutch operations. One of the most tangible results of the whole pro- gramme is the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, which has recently finished the second semester of its merchant bank- ing course and the first of a portfolio management course. The tutors are from top-level schools all over the world, varying from INSEAD to New York University. It offers a selection of high-level, short-term courses. The first aim of the Institute has been to improve the professional level of Dutch bankers. The other aim is to attract and inject international financial know- ledge into Amsterdam by giv- ing high-powered seminars and organising speeches. A large British merchant bank has already expressed interest in sending its staff there. \"This type of educa- tional specialisation cannot be found anywhere. We have filled a gap in the market,\" says Mr Philip Todd deputy managing director of the insti- tute. Edi Cohen",

   "text_content" : "An introduction. Internationale Nederlanden Group Earlier this year, the merger of NMB Postbank Group and Nationale-Nederlanden created a major financial services group in the Netherlands. In terms of capitalisation on the Amsterdam stock exchange it is the third listed Dutch company of any kind. In Internationale Nederlanden Group, the merger created a new entity with significance far beyond the fron- tiers of our home country. As one of Europe's major financial services institutions, it is a business with the critical mass to seize the opportu- nities presented by the Single European Market, and by other developing markets throughout the world. As a business which employs over 50,000 people in 41 countries across the globe, it is a significant player on the world stage. And most important of all, as a group which balances banking and insurance interests, it marks a new stage in the evolution of the financial services industry. Internationale Nederlanden Group now has the re- sources to meet the financial needs of its customers, from private individuals to major multi-national corporations, more comprehensively. We have the capital base, the assets and the necessary skills to builfc upon those strong foundations throughout the world. In this way we can continue to serve the interests of our customers, our intermediaries, our staff and our share- holders alike. ING GROUP Thg ymw#rsmwI IIIWNW' -- domSqWtmrwSth6=mitgs -.-.1.

   "text_content" : "THE single biggest operator on the Amsterdam stock exchange is located not, as one might expect, on a fashionable canal in the centre of the Dutch capi- tal but in the provincial town of Heerlen, which is about as far south as it is possible to travel in the Netherlands with- out straying into Belgium or Germany. It is here that the Dutch civil servants' pension fund ABP - or Algemeen Burgerlijk Pen- sioenfonds - manages its vast assets of F1157.5bn ($79.50bn) making it the second biggest pension fund in the world after TIAA-CREF, a US pension fund for teachers. The fund, whose assets are channeled mainly into fixed- rate securities, is the biggest buyer by far of Dutch govern- ment bonds, holding more than 20 per cent of the state's out- standing debt. Its portfolio of Dutch shares, while relatively small as a per- centage of total assets when compared with the standards of Anglo-Saxon pension funds, is nevertheless significant. With the exception of Royal Dutch Petroleum, ABP holds, on average, a 3.5 per cent stake in every important company listed on the Amsterdam bourse. ABP's location in Heerlen is a legacy of Dutch government policies in the 1970s, when pub- lic institutions were trans- ferred away from the crowded Amsterdam-Hague-Rotterdam triangle to economically disad- vantaged regions in the north and south of the country. From the perspective of 1991, the decision to move ABP to the country's southern-most tip can be seen as symbolic of the fund's wish to expand beyond the relatively small financial markets of .the Netherlands to find new oppor- tunities in Europe and North America. In 1988, ABP was finally freed from severe legal restric- tions which had barred it from investing anywhere outside of the Netherlands. The new rules allowed ABP to invest up to 5 per cent of its assets in foreign property, shares and bonds, and the pension fund has grad- ually but steadily taken advan- tage of this new-found free- dom. In the UK and the US, for example, it has bought build- ings in London, Philadelphia and Cambridge, Massachusetts. It has also taken a 4.5 per cent stake in Hammerson, the UK property development and investment group, with which it plans to make joint venture investments in Europe. So far, ABP has bought a 70 per cent stake in a Hammerson-owned shopping centre in Essen. ABP's overseas property portfolio was worth Fl789m at the end of .1990, representing a sharp rise from Si 126m in 1989. Since 1988, its holdings of for- eign shares have expanded from nil to F12.7bn, represent- ing 34 per cent of its total share holdings but only 1.7 per cent of its total assets. With more than three years of international investment experience behind it, ABP is now seeking permission to expand its foreign investments to a maximum 20 per cent of total assets. This would be done gradually over a number of years, but because of ABP's sheer size, even a cautious expansion of the fund's over- seas presence would herald the emergence of a significant global investor. Mr Jan-Willem Goslings, executive vice-president of the ABP, says the pension fund will probably reach its current 5 per cent celling on foreign investments in late 1992 or early 1993. Besides its desire to step up foreign investments, ABP is also hoping to be freed from two further restrictions, one which forbids it from owning more than 5 per cent of an indi- vidual company's share capital and another which stipulates that no more than 20 per cent of assets may be invested in shares and property. ABP is seeking a combined 30 per cent ceiling on shares and property, with a long-term goal of 40 per cent by the year 2010. Officials say that this would give the fund a much better mix of yields and risks. Jan-Willem Goslings: foreign assets growing Currently, some 90 per cent of ABP's assets are tied up in bonds, loans and mortgages, with only 5 per cent in shares. In share ownership in particu- lar, ABP lags well behind its counterparts in the US and the UK, where shares can often account for 50 per cent or more of a typical portfolio. Because of ABP's size and power, any increase in the scale of share buying would have extremely important implications for the Dutch stockmarket and Dutch compa- nies, especially if the fund becomes a big shareholder in individual companies. In early 1991, ABP publicly joined several other institu- tional shareholders in putting pressure on Nationale-Neder- landen, the insurer, to sweeten the terms of its merger with NMB Postbank. This openly critical stance was out of char- acter for ABP, raising ques- tions about what its position will be if hostile takeover attempts become more preva- lent in the Netherlands in the 1990s due to the expected aboli- tion of certain anti-takeover defences. Mr Goslings says ABP has no intention of becoming an \"aggressive\" shareholder in the mould of some US institu- tional shareholders, adding that the fund's investments are made with a long-term view. He also argues that Dutch com- panies would do well to take cross-stakes in each other, not only to increase their takeover protection but also to create stable industrial structures. \"Big funds can play a stabilis- ing role, and that stability is also in the national interest.\" Although little known abroad, ABP is a giant in the Netherlands, providing pension and disability coverage to im civil servants out of a total population of nearly 15m. The fund's huge size is a result of its funding methods. Rather than paying current pensions out of incoming contributions, ABP's pensions are fully funded in advance, meaning that it starts accumulating cap- ital decades before the pension is paid out. The riches of ABP and other Dutch pension funds and pen- sion plans - which together have assets of Fl480bn - have attracted the attention of poli- ticians looking for ways of reducing the national debt. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime min- ister, has suggested that, because employees pay no tax on their pension deductions and only pay tax on these funds when they reach retire- ment age, 10 per cent of pen- sion funds' assets should be paid to the government now. This transfer of nearly Fl50bn in \"deferred taxation\" from pension funds to state coffers would save the state an annual F15bn in interest pay- ments because it would lower the national debt. Mr Lubbers' idea has been criticised as an artificial method of reducing the budget deficit without having to resort to politically painful spending cuts. The prime minister's trial balloon has quickly been shot down, and ABP seems to be in no immediate danger of having to relinquish some of its assets to The Hague. Ronald van de Krol",

   "text_content" : "AFTER years of losing money on payment transfers, Dutch banks are moving to introduce transaction-linked charges to recoup their losses. At the same time, the wall between the two national payment transfer systems is at last crumbling, and banks are seek- ing to encourage the use of more efficient, automated forms of payment transfers. Last May, the large Dutch banks announced that a sur- prise compromise agreement had been reached on the intro- duction of a National Pay- ments Circuit, bridging the gap between the Postbank's giro payments system and the BankGiroCentrale system run by the rest of the banks. The ground-breaking compo- nent was an agreement over interbank charges: a 30 cent charge for bank giro collection slips and a 10 cent charge for automatic payment slips. Ear- lier, interbank charges had been strongly opposed by ABN Amro Bank. This was a breakthrough on two counts, both as enabling the creation of the long- awaited National Payments Circuit to go ahead and because it facilitated the intro- duction of a system of payment transfer fees related to the cost of the type of transfer, getting rid of cross-subsidisation. Talks on a National Pay- ments Circuit began 16 years ago. The reason it is such a long-running issue is that until the 1960s, the banks did not play a significant role in small payment transfers, but dealt primarily with corporate and institutional payments, while the former Postal Cheque and Giro Service, now the Post- bank's giro payments system, handled virtually all the pay- ment transactions of private individuals. This changed when the com- mercial banks needed addi- tional deposits to expand their lending operations, and began promoting personal accounts. Corporate clients also encour- aged this move, to facilitate payment transfers for staff. As automation accelerated in more recent years, the com- mercial banks (excluding Post- bank) developed their own effi- cient BankGiroCentre automatic clearing house. Today, this clearing system and that of the Postbank are about equal in size. Today's polarisation of bank- ing operations stems from this history. At one end is ABN Amro Bank, characterised as a \"wholesale\" or \"credit\" bank with predominantly corporate clients. At the other is NMB- Postbank, created by the mar- riage between the dominant 'people's bank, Postbank, and Nederlandsche Middenstands- bank, a commercial bank with strong traditional links with small businesses. Because of the way the sys- tem works, this creates an imbalance. The \"debit bank\", Postbank, has a large number of small clients making numer- ous small payment transfers to a wholesale bank such as ABN Amro. The input (making the trans- ser) is more expensive than the output (receipt of the transfer). The BankGiroCentrale is the commercial banks' intermedi- ary, carrying out the adminis- trative work of transferring payments. It makes tapes and sends these to the wholesale banks, which put them in their computers and credit the rele- vant accounts. At the other extreme, \"wholesale\" bank ABN Amro's characteristic payments are high-volume, regular payments such as salary transfers. Trans- ser is cost-efficient, with tapes of large customers sent direct to the BankGiroCentrale. Input costs are therefore much lower, while output costs are the same. The problem was the debit bank. Money going from one bank to another not only bene- fits the creditor but also the bank where the creditor's account is kept. In short, the credit bank profits more and has lower costs. One solution is to let the cli- ent pay. But if NMB Postbank customers paid the real costs Dutch banks must remain profitable as competition Increases in the run up to 1992 of transfers, small banks and savings banks as well as pri- vate individuals would run into serious difficulties. The Central Bank and the finance minister, Mr Wim Kok, have both said that it is impor- tant to cut transactions costs as Dutch banks must remain profitable as competition increases with the approach of the single European market. But they also say that the pay- ment system must be accessi- ble and affordable for all par- ties, including private individuals, small banks and savings banks. Costs of the present pay- ments system are inherently unstable. Last year, it was actually profitable, purely due to high interest rates. But before that, a KPMG survey showed that the banks regu- larly made substantial losses on payment transfers: results depended heavily on develop- ments outside the payment system, and there was no rela- tion between the client's pay- ment pattern and proceeds for the banks. In the past, banks could get around that through cross-sub- sidisation, with the profitable clients or services subsidising the unprofitable. As banks in other countries are discover- ing, this will not work any more with increasing competi- tion. What is needed now is stability and cost-coverage per service, according to industry experts. Sitting between the whole- sale and retail banks is the co- operative Rabobank. As Rabo- bank started off with small, rural clients (farmers), but has built up a considerable corpo- rate business, it has a foot in both camps. It is no coinci- dence therefore that Rabobank last year pioneered a system of transaction-linked transfer charges for its customers. Postbank launched a tariff system from July 1 1991. In the first year, it is charging 45 cents for impayments, but it Will not carge smaller dients with tractons of Iless than 1 18,000 annually. In the sec- ond year, it plans to Intiodaun a 15cent charge on direct deb iting and change its charges on direct debiting. This incensed some of its larger clients, and mail order company Otto en Neckermann took Postbank to court in an effort to make it change its mind, claiming the tariffs were much too high. ABN Amro began talks with its business clients this year in the summer on the introduc- tion of a system of indicative prices, with agreements to be made individually based on their payment traffic profile. Cheaper, automated payments will attract lower fees. Such moves have been facli- tated by the May agreement to pay internally through inter- bank charges for differences in costs. A bank whose account is debited gets 10 cents from the bank whose account is cred- ited, while \"impayment\" using pre-prepared transfer forms costs 30 cents. Thus banks with large numbers of small clients are compensated for the large amount of paperwork involved. The other key ingredient in increasing efficiency, encour- aging cheaper, automated transfer systems also got a boost in the same week in May when the Dutch banking asso- ciation NVB reached agree- ment with lobby groups which have been opposing banking charges. The lobby groups comprised the \"No bank charges\" organisation of pri- vate bank customers and pay- ment services, the organisation for business users of the pay- ments system and the whole- sale and retail business organi- sation, as well as the two large employer organisations. These bodies agreed to work together to promote cheaper forms of payments, which experts estimate could save up to Fl lbn annually in the cost of payment transfers, NVB says. This means both switch- ing usage from the most expen- sive form, ordinary credit transfers, to pre-prepared pay- ment transfers (impayment) and also encouraging a move- ment up to the next rung, to direct debiting. Impayments are about three times as expen- sive as direct debiting on aver- age. Meanwhile, work on unify- ing the two payments systems into the National Payments Circuit is pressing ahead in stages. Direct debit will come first, followed by impayments and guaranteed cheques, to be completed by the year-end. This will eliminate the extra day presently taken to transfer from one system to the other. Corporate salaries are already transferred directly. The more successful the banks are in encouraging use of cheaper, automated payment transfer systems, the faster they can reduce costs, enabling them to keep whatever pay- ment fees are introduced mod- est, helping defuse objections to fees.

   "text_content" : "LONG accustomed to having an array of legal weapons to ward off potential predators, Dutch companies are grow- ing ncreasingly nervous about Euro- pean Community plans which could force them to lower their guard against unfriendly takeover bids. The EC's plans, if adopted, would cover all 12 member countries, not just the Netherlands. But Dutch companies say they would be particularly vulnera- ble to takeovers if proposed changes to BC directives reduced their ability to put up technical barriers to hostile bid- ders. A study by Coopers & Lybrand on behalf of the Amsterdam bourse and the Dutch Association of Listed Compa- nies underlines the sense of concern in the Netherlands. \"With the removal of the technical barriers, the Netherlands would join the UK in becoming one of two EC countries with virtually no technical barriers and only weak struc- tural barriers to takeovers.\" The EC proposals, put forward by Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commis- sioner, would severely curtail the use of the some of the most widely-used anti- takeover techniques available in the Netherlands. Restrictions which limit the voting power of individual shareholders, regardless of the number of shares held, would also be abolished. Dutch compa- nies argue that, unlike counterparts in France, Italy and Germany, they would be most at risk to unwanted takeovers because of the fact that they rely only on these technical, legal barriers to keep predators at bay. Concern about the EC's intentions marks a new phase in a campaign by companies in the Netherlands to retain their extensive anti-takeover mecha- nisms. With their traditionally low price/ earnings ratios and their close trading ties with the rest of Europe, Dutch com- panies see themselves as easy prey for foreign companies wishing to establish a springboard into the EC's planned single market. Until recently, the focus of corporate attention was the Amsterdam stock exchange, which has long believed that excessive takeover protection depresses Dutch share prices and makes for an imperfect market. In 1989, the stock exchange's controversial proposals for regulating the scope of anti-takeover mechanisms were heavily watered down after strong opposition from listed Dutch companies. The eventual compromise, perceived as a victory for proponents of the status quo, exempted all companies already listed on the bourse from the new rules, pending the formulation of EC-wide diredtives. With the focus of concern now firmly centred on Brussels, the government in The Hague has said that it will \"vigor- ously oppose\" any changes to EC take- over rules that do not create a truly level playing field. So far, unfriendly takeover bids in the Netherlands have been exceedingly rare and invariably unsuccessful. The last attempt was the hostile bid by Elsevier, the Dutch publishing group, for Kluwer, a fellow publisher, in 1987. Kluwer, which escaped Elsevier's embrace by activating anti-takeover devices and then merging with another company, denounced Elsevier's tactics as \"unDutch\" and therefore unaccept- able. Significantly, the climate of opinion has shifted since then, partly as a result of shareholders' frustration with their limited voice in the running of Dutch companies. At the same time, dramatic losses by such leading concerns as Phil- ips, the electronics group, and Ned- Ioyd, the shipping and transport comr pany, have - in some cases - shaker investor confidence in existing manage ment. For all these reasons, traditional Dutch distaste for unfriendly takeover bids is waning, albeit gradually. One sign of the times was the launch in April of a new investment fund, Dutch Take-Over Targets, on the stock exchange's parallel market. Even if anti-takeover devices are cur- tailed, no-one is predicting a great wave of hostile takeovers or the sudden emer- gence of Dutch asset-strippers. The Dutch system of corporate governance would frustrate any attempt to push through the rapid closing down of facto- ries or large-scale lay-offs of workers. A bidder, whether domestic or foreign, would need to reckon with - and work inside - a business culture that empha- sises consensus rather than conflict. Ronald van do Krol"

   "text_content" : "AFTER decades of accepting a heavily circumscribed role in the running of Dutch compa- nies, shareholders in the Netherlands are increasingly demanding - and sometimes getting - the right to be heard on matters of vital importance to a company's future. The new-found voice of Dutch shareholders was heard loudly and clearly earlier this year when some of the coun- try's most powerful institu- tional investors joined forces and openly criticised the terms of the merger between Nat- ionale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank. In a surprising and unusual display of shareholder muscle, the Robeco investment group, the civil servants' pension fund ABP and Unilever's corporate pension fund put pressure on Nat-Ned, the country's largest insurance group, and NMB Postbank, the third biggest Dutch bank, to sweeten their swap offer in favour of Nat-Ned shareholders. In the end, Nat-Ned and -NMB Postbank bowed to this unprecedented pressure and agreed to pay Nat-Ned share- holders an extra F16.50 per share. This was less than the institutions had originally sought but enough to win their support and guarantee that the merger could proceed as planned. The most unusual aspect of the strife between Nat-Ned and its shareholders was the fact that all the participants were Dutch-based. Until the contro- versy erupted, most cases of shareholder \"militancy\" in the Netherlands had involved for- eign firms. In November, for example, Fidelity Investments of the US led efforts - which later failed - to force Pakhoed, the Rotter- dam storage and transport group, to raise its friendly takeover bid for Furness, the Dutch stevedores. Fidelity's campaign came half a year after dissident shareholders in Verkade, a Dutch biscuit maker, had wrung a signifi- cantly higher takeover price out of United Biscuits of the UK. In the case of the Nat-Ned/ NMB Postbank merger, another new and significant development was the vigorous role played by the Dutch share- holders' lobby group, the Ver- eniging van Effectenbezitters, (VEB). Led by its chairman, Mr Robert de Haze Winkelman, the VEB mounted a novel newspaper advertising cam- paign aimed at collecting proxy votes against the merger terms. Its efforts were ulti- mately unsuccessful but the VEB claimed a moral victory nevertheless. \"The VEB has drawn the conclusion that investors are increasingly prepared to voice their opinions as sharehold- ers,\" it said. The VEB is quickly emerg- ing as an outspoken advocate of shareholder rights. Soon after its prominent role in the Nat-Ned/NMB Postbank con- troversy, the lobby group threw its weight behind attempts by Mr Torstein Hagen, the London-based Nor- wegian investor, to win three seats on the supervisory board of Nedlloyd, the Dutch trans- port group in which he holds a stake of more than 20 per cent. Backed by the VEB, Mr Hagen convinced shareholders to withhold approval of Ned- Iloyd's 1990 annual accounts in protest at the company's refusal to submit to his demands. Mr Hagen argues that his significant sharehold- ing, plus his plans for turning around the loss-making com- pany, entitle him to represen- tation on the board. Nedlloyd counters with the argument that Dutch compa- nies, unlike Anglo-Saxon com- panies, do not apportion board seats on the basis of share ownership. Instead, the self-perpetuating supervisory board is designed to represent the interests of all \"stake- holders\" - employees, custom- ers, management, the commu- nity, as well as shareholders. This concept of stakeholders is the pivot on which the Dutch debate on shareholder rights turns. In the 1960s and 1970s, shareholders rights were gradually eroded in the belief that this would guarantee the continuity of companies and, more importantly, the survival of jobs. The downgrading of the shareholder's role is best illus- trated by the process of \"certi- fication\". Many companies asked shareholders in the 1960s and 1970s to give up their ordi- nary shares in exchange for share \"certificates\". These enti- tle the holder to dividend pay- ments but not to real votes in shareholder meetings. Instead, the voting rights are exercised by an administration office which, in practice, is closely allied to existing man- agement. Through these and other methods, Dutch compa- nies managed to create effec- tive barriers to unfriendly takeovers. Not surprisingly, the current debate about shareholder rights is part of a wider re-ex- amination of the desirability of toppling some of the many hur- dles to hostile takeovers erected in the Netherlands over the years. In effect, the dual issues of shareholder rights and hostile takeovers are central to the debate on how far the Nether- lands should go in adopting Anglo-Saxon practices. The greater vocality of sharehold- ers is itself a reflection of Anglo-Saxon influences that have seeped into the normally staid world of Dutch finance with the globalisation of national capital markets. This does not mean that Dutch institutions will want to start playing as active a role as some US and UK institutions do. But the experience of the past year does show that insti- tutional investors in particular are no longer content simply to put up capital and then to allow management an entirely free rein. The days of share- holder passivity seem well and truly over. Ronald van de Krol",

   "text_content" : "WEWELER, spring producer for the truck industry, started out in 1989 with a quote of F175 a share on the Amster- dam parallel market, the sec- ondary market where small stocks are listed. In six months the shares had soared to Fl 150 on takeover rumours. Every- one, including James Capel, praised the company in the highest terms. The company itself issued warning statements that inves- tors should not expect too much. But to no avail. The potential takeover fell through because of market conditions in the UK and because of the investors, largely individuals, who scrambled for cover in a total panic. The share price crashed to under 35 and stands now around Fl 39. This course of events has been typical of the relatively short history of the Amster- dam parallel market. After years of meteoric price rises the market dropped suddenly during the crash of 1987. Since then it has had to work hard to shed its cowboy image. True, performance has been volatile based on thin vol- ume among quick-to-panic, mostly private investors. The stabilising factor of large insti- tutional investors has been absent. But generally speaking, says Mr Richard de Rooy, head of capital markets department at Credit Lyonnais Bank Neder- land, one of the leaders in par- allel market stocks, the market has been relatively successful. Aside from the patchy liquid- ity, both investors and issuers have become more mature. Approximately 75 companies are listed in comparison with, for example, the Belgian sec- ondary market where only five inactive stocks are quoted. Anothr maoltive mint awrd. ing to Mr de Rooy, is that many parallel market stocks are moe active than many an Micial market stock. \"There are twospedalsts who are solely inpealed i parallel market stocks and threfore chase them harder than many asa (Iar- ket makers) on the offial marr who ave many diaer- set shares on their books,' elains r de Rooy. Our esample was a star perfoer on the pa market until it graduateod to ieoud imlarketw rei s- Maisd in the i- ,anrket was Iramin SIS pur*n as tsabm forml the was a fa1redk mantitd maMt oa wtBch tl Iar s ofsecrul- ties were traded unofficially. The price-making process was non-transparent, with few supervision or regulations. Because of these shortcom- ings the business community thought it necessary to set up a secondary market in addition to the official market. There were few limitations for the potential companies. Required capital started at a minimum of Fl 250,000. The application costs were negligible. The new secondary market started with around 19 listings and quickly gained momen- tum. After Tulip, Datex and Content a whole range of com- panies came to the market Until October 1987 every- thing looked rosy. But the crash left the market reeling. There was enormous supply and hardly any demand. Share prices were totally dependent on panicking private investors. Soon some black sheep among the listed companies were exposed and horror stories about certain companiessuch as Text-lite and Homburgmnan- aged to scare many investors away. It was clear that the dubious image of the parallel market had to be cleaned up. In early 1990 the Amsterdam stock exchange installed a set of new regulations. The name was changed to the official parallel market. With the intervention and name change, the stock exchange succeeded in trans- forming the whole perception of the parallel market. It had previously looked upon the market as a stepping stone to the main market. Now, the official parallel market was seen as an integral part of the Amsterdam market system. In order to even-out the volatile price fluctuations, the minimum market capitalis- ation was raised to FL 5m. The idea was that if the required market capitalisation was raised, the stability of the market would be automatically improved. New issues have been scarce but the higher market capitalisation has not been the cause. If this 2,000 per cent raise is an inhibition for a company that is fine. He will just have to go to the unlisted parallel market,\" Says Mr A deBrun, head of invest- ment banking at Credit Lyon- nais Nedfland. Another new regulation is that companies have to show three consecutive annual reports. In the old market, newborn companies were Credit Lyonnais Bank Neder- land (CLBN), which is sped- alised on the parallel market and is wellknown for bringing about some successful new issues, is pleaed with the way the market is going. Many would welcome more entrants to the market, but the main hope is that more institutional investors will develop an inter- est. According to CLBN's Mr de Rooy there is little chance that this will happen in the near future. \"The smaller pension funds simply don't have enough people to watch the tiny parallel market funds the whole time and the larger ones have too many options from all over the world,\" says Mr de Rooy. One sign of the growing maturity of the market has been the fact that there have recently been some signs of interest from foreign investors who previously steered clear of the uncertainties. In the middle of the Gulf cri- sis CLBN made a private place- ment of parallel market shares of Grontmaj, an environmental company. In spite of the bad timing, the placement was suc- cessful and received a reason- able amount of interest from institutional investors in the UK. For CLBN this was a sign that the market was now bet- ter known abroad. But in order to attract more foreign investors, information about the companies has to be improved. CLBN and ABN Amro do regular research in English on the various compa- nies but there is still room for improvement. The main problem of the par- allel market is its meagre liquidity and dependence on the whims of private investors. There is little the financial community can do about this for the moment. But it can control the gen- eral quality of the listed com- panies. CLBN and ABN Amro are busy trying to do just that by perfecting the due diligence procedures before issues and holding companies carefully by the hand after the issue has been completed. Edi Cohen"

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR finished weaker in Europe after a quiet day, with the US currency gaining some support from a larger than expected rise to 54.8 from 51.8 in the August US National Association of Purchasing Managers index. The market expected a figure of about 52.7. It was the sev- enth consecutive month that the NAPM index increased and the third month in a row that it was above 50. A reading higher than the 50 level indi- cates that the manufacturing sector is expanding. There were no other impor- tant factors with the market also showing little reaction to a rise of 1.6 per cent in July US construction spending, after a gain of 0.3 per cent in June. Dealers are now waiting for Friday's US employment data, amid speculation that the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 from 6.8 per cent in August and that non-farm payrolls climbed 50,000, after falling 51,000 in July.

The government has already admitted that it will exceed the FFr8Om deficit set for a target in 1991, while some economists expect it to be above FFr1OOm. The finance ministry now sug- gests that the deficit will reach 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year, rather than the target of 1.17 per cent on which the budget was origi- nally based. The Spanish peseta showed no movement at the top of the ERM as the Bank of Spain left its money market intervention rate at 12.6 per cent at a 12-day repurchase agreement tender. The next likely opportunity for a change in Spanish monetary policy is seen as publication of the August consumer price index on September 12.",

   "text_content" : "INTEREST RATES continued to fall and prices of short ster- ling futures rose in London yesterday as optimism increased that bank base rates may be cut about the time of the next UK retail prices index on September 13. A sharp fall to around 4.7 from 5.5 per cent is expected in the year-on-year inflation rate. Three-month sterling inter- bank fell to O1N-10A from 10- 10 per cent and 12-month money was quoted at 10ft-10 against 10&-10% per cent. On Liffe December short sterling UK dldl ba hbW khin raM 11pw se \"m JMy 12, 1I1 futures rose to 89.9 from 89.2. Day-to-day credit was in fairly short supply on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Â£800m and revised this to 2SIm at noon and to Â£1000Im in the afternoon. Total assistance of Â£802m was provided. An early rounld of help was dered and at that time the authorities boght tbm whu Including 1270m outright in band I at 10% per cent Another t17ma bills were purchased for resale to the market on September 10 at an inerest rate of 1o0 per cent. There was no further intervention in the bill market during the day, but late assistance of Â£15m was provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Â£648m, with the unwinding of repurchase agreements on bills absorbing Â£307m and bank balances below target Â£175m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Â£170m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Â£160m. In Frankfurt call money eased to 9.05 from 9.10 per cent as the Bundesbank ofered to add liquidity via a three-tranche securities repurchase agreement tender. It was the first time the central bank had offered repurchase funds on three separate dates, but dealers said it was a clear sign that the Bundesbank was trying to increase the flexibility of its money market operations. The move allowed the central bank to move expiring funds forward to mid-month, rather than allowing ctilities to finish at the start of each month. Some 40 per cent of outstanding funds are due this week. The 14, 28 and 6day repurchase acts were ered at variable bid rates and will offset two faclities toalling DN49.4bn expiring today.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street SHARE PRICES fluctuated wildly yesterday as the market wrestled with the implications of the latest news on the US economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.93 at 3,017.67, while the more broadly-based Standard & Poors eased 3.28 to 392.15. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks ended down 4.76 at 520.92, and NYSE turnover was a modest 155m shares. The Dow gained almost 15 points in the first half hour of trading, after the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported that its index of manufacturing trends rose from 51.8 per cent in July to 54.8 per cent last month. It was the seventh consecu- tive monthly rise, and the third month running that the index has been over 50 per cent, which is an indication that the manufacturing econ- omy is expanding rather than contracting. Investors were able to take a positive or a negative view of the data. On the plus side it showed that the US is pulling out of its recession, but on the minus side the strength in manufacturing could persuade the Federal Reserve that inter- est rates do not need to be cut to stimulate economic activity. The latter argument took hold later in the session, send- ing prices lower. The market hopes that if this Friday's August employment report shows weak labour market conditions, the Fed will ease monetary policy but these hopes were unable to stem a burst of late program selling, which left the Dow at its lows for the day. Among individual stocks, Aetna slipped $% to $35% on forecasts that claims from Hur- ricane Bob, which hit the US eastern seaboard a fortnight ago, would reduce the insur- ance companys third-quarter profits by about $27m. or 25 cents a share. Koger Equity dropped $% to $5 after the trust was forced to cut its dividend from 32% cents a share to just 12 cents a share because of financial diffi- culties at Koger Properties. Compaq Computer jumped $1 to $36% after Mr David Korus, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, raised his rating on the company from \"underper- form\" to \"buy\", citing his approval of measures that Compaq had taken to improve its performance in the highly competitive personal computer market. Browning-Ferris fell $4'/ to $21% on volume of 3m shares as Wall Street analysts cut their earnings estimates fol. lowing a pfts warning fom It haidncome from continu. ing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter ending this month would be about 15 per cent to 2 per cent lower than in the third quarter. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, prafit-taking dropped Intel $1 to $4W%. Microsoft (2% to $83%, and Amgen $2% to $157%. Collagen shed $1% to $19 on the news that the Food and Drug Administration is considering asking the com- pany to change the labelling on some products. TORONTO stocks closed lower in light trading, pushed down by falling transportation stocks. According to preliminary fig- ures, the composite index closed at 3,504.86, down 13.03 points from Friday. Declining issues outnum- bered advances 271 to 246 on volume of 15.3m shares valued at CS183m. Thirteen of 14 stock groups closed lower, led by transporta- tion, off 2.6 pc. Laidlaw 'B' dropped 3/8 to 12 83/4 to lead the group. Mining fell 1.6 pc, indus- trial products and consumer products also closed lower, and. financial services posted a slight drop.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES moved in a narrow range yesterday, track- ing movements in the futures markets. The Nikkei average finished almost unchanged, as foreign buying continued to absorb arbitrage-related sell- ing, writes Emiko Temazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed up 0.79 at 22,469.80 after a high for the day of 22,597.21 and a low of 22,419.00. Turnover again totalled 320m shares. Contin- ued buying by foreign inves- tors supported volume, but traders said domestic institu- tions were reluctant to commit funds before the September book closing. Gains led losses by 443 to 359, with 240 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first sec- tion stocks shed 5.55 to 1,744.15, but in London trading the ISE/ Nikkei 50 index ended 4.03 firmer at 1,334.89. Futures prices fell, led by a volatile bond market; the cash market was affected but found support from selective buying.

   "text_content" : "THE BRUSSELS stock market is not the most comfortable place to be at the moment But the locals still have confidence in the exchange, in spite of the much- publicised financial difficulties of its clients - the small stock- brokers - and of the bourse authorities themselves. Cobepa ort for Compagnie Bege e Participations Pari- bas, is Belgium's largest hold- ing company after the better- known Socdtd Generale de Bel- gique and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert. Within the last fort- night it has made public a desire to improve the liquidity of its shares on the Belgian market, 66.7 per cent of which are owned by Groupe Paribas, of France, with much of the balance held by cautious Bel- gian institutions. This year, Cobepa shares have risen only 6 per cent, reaching BFr4,980 yesterday, compared with a gain of 13 per cent in the local-currency FT- Actuaries Belgium Index. In spite of being one of Bel- gium's largest quoted compa- nies, with a market capitalisa- tion of BFr42.4bn ($1.2bn), Cobepa is frustrated by the Shue pkos rebesd (BUFo) public lack of knowledge about the group. This is not a new problem. But the stickiness of Cobepa's shares has also high- lighted the fact that they are trading at a widening discount to the group's net asset value. Cobepa likes to describe itself as the 20th century equiv- alent of a 19th century mer- chant banker/investor, provid- ing financial advice but also owning a wide portfolio of minority holdings in its own right. That partly explains why it is still comparatively face- less. Unlike its larger counter- parts, such as Socidtd Gdenr- ale, Cobepa does not take a strong operational hand in run- ning the industrial strategy of groups in which it has a stake. And because it insists on a friendly relationship with its associate companies, it rarely makes the headlines. Mr Christophe Evers, who is in charge of Cobepa's Treasury and market operations, says that improving the ability of investors to trade Cobepa stock would provide a service to existing shareholders, and encourag contacts with other international companies. Mr Evers, who is responsible for the group's short-term share portfolio, stresses that Cobepa neither wants nor needs to raise new funds imme- diately. That reflects the com- pany's attitude to its own investments on the Belgian exchange: \"Basically we are cautious at the moment. We are investing, but not that enthusiastic about investing on a large scale and that is true of the trading portfolio and the longer term shareholdings.\" Such caution is understand- able given the present climate of the Brussels exchange, When not becalmed, Belgian company shares risk being rocked by squalls of short-term speculation. For example, Elec- troral, a small Belgian holding company, set the rumour mills spinning three weeks ago when it revealed that Tonton Tapis - \"Uncle Carpet\" - a Belgian chain of carpet retailers in which the holding company has a 40 per cent stake, was having severe financial diffi- culties with its French stores. Released from temporary suspension by the bourse authorities, Blectrorail stock has become a prey for specula- tors. The shares slipped nearly 20 per cent in five days, and the company was forced to pro- duce a statement pointing out that the problems at Tonton Tapis were the sole reason for the share suspension. Last week, the shares jumped 8.5 per cent, closing yesterday at BFr284. \"It was a story of one- way sellers and no buyers,\" explains one analyst. \"And then last week we saw some really speculative buyers.\" Shares in Colruyt also attracted attention last week, rising more than 6 per cent after institutions decided to sel some large stakes in the Belgian retail group, exciting buyers' interest. The shares have now increased by more than 40 per cent since the beginning of the year, standing yesterday at BFrS,900, and some brokers still believe they are undervalued. \"People are investing for fundamental reasons: they are going to get good results [from Colmryt]. On top of that, there is always the speculative possi- bility that at some stage part of the family holding might be sold,\" says Mr Evers. He retains his confidence in Brussels, in spite of its recent overall sluggishness. \"It has a bit of catching up to do in rela- tion to the other markets. It is still true that in ratio terms the Belgian market is cheaper than its neighbours.\" Yester- day the Bel20 index rose 7.69 to 1,139.95. If Cobepa does eventually expand its shareholder base, it will at least give analysts something to talk about. As one Brussels broker puts it: \"There is never really a story around Cobepa. It's been a lit- tle bit boring in recent years.\"",

   "text_content" : "BOURSES REMAINED quiet yesterday, with marketmakers accounting for much of the trading volume, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed near its 1991 high in moderate trading, but there was little excitement in the market The CAC 40 index added 9.66 to 1,873.18, com- pared with a year's high of 1,874.81 set on June 11. Turn- over grew to about FFrl.95bn from FFrl.l5bn. State-owned companies con- tinued to attract interest, on hopes that the government would attach voting rights to investment certificates. One dealer said that the rally in the certificates was now probably over, adding that it was unlikely that the state would cede control of more than 25 per cent of any company. Certificates in BNP, which is said to be on the point of tak- ing a cross shareholding in Dresdner Bank of Germany, gained FFrl6, or 5.5 per cent, to FFr307 with 161,225 exchanged. Pechiney also #dded FFr16, or 5' er cent,'t FFr339 with 132,400 changing hands. However, Rh6ne-Poulenc's certificates fell FFr5.80 to FFr411.20 after the chemical and drug comhliany announced second-quarter results at the low end of expectations. Elsewhere, Peugeot fell FFr11 to FFr62S on the news that its car sales had fallen 23.8 per cent in August from the same month last year. Sanofl, the pharmaceuticals company, was steady at FFr948 before reporting first-half fig- ures better than most expecta- tions after the market closed. FRANKFURT saw movement in a few second liners as the bulk of equities drifted in thin volume. German market turn- over recovered to DMSbn from DM2.7bn, as the FAZ index eased 0.64 to 687.30 at midses- sion and the DAX closed 5.18 higher at 1,655.64. Continental, seen as a specu- lative buy by James Capel, the stockbrokers, after Friday's interim report, rose DM5 to DM220 after a gain of DM33.30 on Friday. A financial adviser to Pirelli Spa, the Italian com- pany involved in an extended courtship of the German tyre- maker, said on Monday that Pirelli had not been buying Conti's shares. Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), the computer arm of the electricals giant, rose DM7.50 to DM245.50. On Monday, SNI said that it had won a DM130m order to equip 1,400 savings banks in eastern Germany with elec- tronic banking systems. MILAN edged higher in sub- dued trade. The Comit index rose 2.52 to 555.48. Mr Roberto Morelli of County NatWest estimated that turnover might have risen from L45bn to L70bn, but that L20bn to L25bn of this reflected stocks sold in the liquidation of two failed stockbrokers caught in the lat- est share scandal FT-MS WurerMBk 100 - Sep 3 Hourly ohanges Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1pm 2 pm 3 pm Close 1128.27 1128.43 1128.64 1128.53 1128.43 1127.93 1129.38 1128.91 Day's High 1129.80 Day's Low 1127.77 Sep 2 Aug 30 Aug 29 Aug 28 Aug 27 1126.81 1125.84 1124.82 1121.03 1118.91 Bua valu 1000 (210190). Meanwhile, telecoms recov- ered. County noted that SIP rights not taken up in the recent issue, estimated at 12.5 per cent of the total, had been sold in the Turin bourse for a nominal one-hundredth of a lira. With the potential over- hang removed, Stet rose L30 to L1,958. COPENHAGEN edged lower overall, but telecoms stocks moved sharply higher. There was speculation that the price at which telecoms companies' shares will be converted into Teledanmark shares next year will be higher than previously announced. JTAS rose DKr70O or 28 per cent to DKr320 and KTAS gained DKr25 or 13.2 per cent to DKr215. STOCKHOLM eased on profit-taking and pre-election uncertainty. The AffirsvArlden General index fell 11.9 or 1.1 per cent to 1,078.5 in turnover of SKr247m, after SKr274m. Trelleborg restricted B shares fell SKr5 to SKrll2. The company has said that Custo- dia, the investment company in which it holds 25 per cent stake, was in need of an injec- tion of new capital. The news that the mining and industrial products group has agreed to sell property worth about SKr500m also triggered specu- lation about a deterioration in second-quarter results. OSLO declined in moderate trading, with the all-share index down 4.78 at 515.11 in tu ver of NKr281m. ZURICH virtually stood still, the Credit Suisse index closing a mere 0.1 higher at 536.3. Alu- suisse followed suit, steady at SFr1,050 in spite of forecasting a fall of about a third in profits this year. The aluminium and chemical company said that it expected to pay the same divi- dend for 1991. AMSTERDAM slipped in quiet trading, after lower-than- expected first-half results from Gist Brocades, the biotechnol- ogy company. The stock lost F11.80 to F135.30, as the CBS tendency index fell 0.1 to 91.5.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor HINTS OF an impending rights issue restrained the London stock market yesterday, and with Wall Street making a slow return from the Labor Day hol- iday, UK stocks gave up about one third of the gains achieved in the previous session. Many of the stocks tipped as bid favourites on Monday slipped back yesterday and the market looked cautious ahead of the heavy list of corporate profits news due over the next fortnight. Increased Seaq turn- over of 432.3m shares, against 368m the previous day, indi- cated some profit-taking by investors, although traders said that intra-market business was also brisk. The FT-SE Index closed 10.6 off at 2,669.0, having touched 2,667.1 at the day's low. In early trading, the market A 8P 2 8P 16 Aug 1 Gsp 12 sop s Aug 30 Sep 13 Sep 27 Seso e s 23s sut 7 I- I OR No oM \" moved erratically, gaining four points on the Footsie scale with the help of an initial improvement in the Footsie futures contract. However, the subsequent fall in share prices reflected selling by investors. While generally disturbed by fears of a rights issue, traders were in disagreement when it came to mentioning names. Several analysts doubted that rights issues, in current trad- ing conditions, need be linked to corporate profits announce- ments. They pointed out that und-raisers are now likely to be driven by opportunistic motives linked to the present strength of equities and by doubts as to whether these lev- els will be held in the short term. The underlying tonW of the equity market remained one of optimism on the domestic front, but balanced by some caution on the international side. A sluggish performance by other European markets emphasised London's inclina- tion to hold back ahead of pub- lication on Friday of thelatest employment data from across the Atlantic, which will give further evidence of economic trends in the US. Some UK analysts, notably the economics team at Smith New Court, suggested that domnestl. base rate m ht be reduced by another half-polnt following the August retail price Indx figures, de Dnet week on August 18. The Smith New Court team also predicted that the headline rate on domestic inflation could drop to 3.3 per cent by October this year, underpinning market seen t and. further bolster- ing the Conservative govern- ment's standing in the public opinion polls. Other equity strategists remained optimistic on pros- pects for the London stock market. Kleinwort Benson Securities maintained that the Footsie is \"on target\" to reach the 3,000 level, encouraged by falling inflation, further base rate cuts, increasing signs of economic recovery, an approaching upturn in earn- ngs, reduced fbars hof er German interest rates and all Street's strength. However, te UK merchant bank also admits. that the eco- noaic recovery may po and that forthcomin rL ht isues and the poilMaoutlo could cloud the proapect for equities. Overhanging other factore is the uncertain timing for a UK general election, although few strategists now expect an election thsu year. At Hoare Govett, Mr Richard Lake believes that 73 per cent of the Footale stocks are now in bullish trends and that the Footsie Is set for 2,780 over the short term. Yamaichi Interna- tional (Europe) believes that expectations of a Footsie at 2,800 in 12 months time \"are not overly ambitious\".",

   "text_content" : "THE commencement yesterday of a series of presentations to analysts by Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, prompted a sharp fall in the share price after the company voiced concern over the perfor- mance of its Aids drug Retro- vir. The shares fell 21 during early trading but recovered to close 14 off at 746p after a turn- over of 1.3m, very heavy for the stock. The company told pharma- ceuticals specialists that the drug was being used by Aids sufferers but not being taken up by people who were merely HIV positive. As a result, Leh- man Brothers cut back its fore- cast for Wellcome's 1992 profits by Â£20m to Â£460m and its 1993 estimate by Â£30m to 570m. Lehman, which had been one of the optimists on Wellcome, was the first securities house to be visited by the company. The cut drew attention away from a slight upgrade in fore- casts by Robert Fleming. Mr Franc Gregori of Fleming said: \"We already had a conser- vative estimate on Retrovir and we are slightly more posi- tive on the prospects for the company's anti-herpes drug Zovirax.\" Waters active Water shares opened on a strong note, boosted by the late bout of buying activity on Monday, but then ran back as the market reacted to news that Ofwat, the water industry regulator, had agreed licence changes with the English and Welsh water companies, ensur- ing that diversification does not harm existing customers. A susbsequent statement from Ofwat was regarded as more conciliatory and share prices stabilised to close with just some minor losses on the day. Also affecting trading in the waters was the impact of the exceptionally heavy deal- ing late on Monday. Big deals carried out then affected Anglian, which closed 5 higher yesterday at 385p, Sev- ern Trent, 6 up at 350p, Thames, 3 firmer at 381p, and Yorkshire, 3 ahead at 400p. Reuters optimism Reuters was one of the big gainers in the Footsie yester- day as the market picked up talk that problems over the company's two new dealing systems could be coming to an end. The shares rose 11 to 908p, the first time they have been above 900p since Reuters announced in August last year that it was having trouble with the systems - Dealing 2000-2 and Globex. Mr Brian Newman of Hen- derson Crosthwaite said: \"There is speculation in the trade that the two systems should become revenue pro- ducers in the first quarter of next year. Also, a number of US houses have turned buyers in the past week.\" He added that the rise was further helped by breaking through of what several analysts consider a significant chart barrier. Glaxo slipped back 15 to 1358p after a recent strong per- formance. The company was informed yesterday that the holding of Glaxo shares in the US had been boosted by 14m to 330m over the past two months. More than 22 per cent of Glaxo's shares are now held in the form of American Depos- itary Receipts (ADRs) by the Bank of New York. Taylor Woodrow declined 12 to 213p on 2.2m shares as the market gave the thumbs down to interim profits that had fallen from Â£38m to Â£25.3m. The dividend was unchanged. Analyst began chopping full- year forecasts; Robert Fleming Securities cut 1991 estimates from Â£60m to Â£45m and next year's from Â£74m to Â£55m. The broker said investors wanting exposure to the con- tracting sector should switch into Laing; on 27 times earn- ings for this year and 24 times for next year, Taylor's shares are not the obvious UK hous- ing recovery play, Fleming went on to say. Guinness was the main sea- ture among drink stocks on talk that the company would announce a share split with figures due later this month. The shares added 5 at 1033p, helped by a squeeze and a buy recommendation from Hoare Govett. Turnover reached 1.5m. Bass followed the market lower, shedding 9 to 994p on 1.2m. BZW remained buyers of the stock, but while sticking to its profits forecast of Â£490m for the year to September 1991, it cut back 1992 expectations by Â£25m to Â£580m. Profit-taking after Monday's run weakened Allied-Lyons. The shares eased 5 to 612p. Dealers spoke of a deter- mined seller of BP shares, which fell away to close a net 4% lower at 349%p on above average turnover of 5.4m. Shell, on the other hand, moved up 4 more to 537p on good turnover of 2.8m as a number of brokers took the view that the shares had been oversold. Switching out of BP and into Shell was also reported. Stories of an imminent rights issue continued to take the shine off Burmah-Castrol, leaving the stock a fraction easier on the day at 595p. Spe- cialists refused to write off the chances of a cash call from the lubricants group and high- lighted the company's 60 per cent gearing. Premier Consolidated put on 1% to 35%p after being recom- FT.A All.Share Index 130C 115C Turr Exdlu In(Ra- 600 400 200 men the vain the 1 tial ingl Thai W1 endi: fron Ausf Al the CRA state cillec arou So boot isswt that marl exag tors ing; of o JSl Teac Inn was hanr aus to 51 Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Excluding: Intramu-nM busness Ovwrm tumove mended by Strauss Turnbul; the broker highlighted the value of Premier's stake in the Wytch Farm and the poten- tial of its forthcoming drill- ing programme in the Gulf of Thaland RT3 dropped to 586p before ending 13 off at 590p as the market reacted to poor results from its 49 per cent-owned Australian associate CRA. Analysts were dismayed by the cautious line adopted by CRA in the accompanying statement. Brokers have pen- cilled in full-year forecasts of around Â£315m for RTZ. Food retailers were given a boost as Kleinwort Benson issued a circular which argued that the worries over a super- market price war had been exaggerated. It advised inves- tors to bring their food retail- ing holdings back to the level of other sectors. Kleinwort's particular favourites were J. Salnsbury, up 2 at 367p, and Tesco, 4 firmer at 275p. Pentos moved ahead 14 to 163p as the UK's second biggest bookseller announced interim results that surpassed most analysts' forecasts. Sears, up a penny at 90p, was again a busy two-way mar- ket with 7.5m shares changing hands. Reports of a large seller caused Kingfisher to weaken 9 to 572p. Concern over its Australian operations depressed BTR, which fell 9'/% to 432'p ahead of romorrow's interim results. Industrial management group Tomkins set an all-time high of 400p (up 4 on the day) as buyers looked towards recovery in the US. Radiant Metal gained IS to 106p. It has risen sharply over the past few days from a low of 70p as one institution has taken interest in the stock. Results for Bowater were better than even the most opti- mistic expectations and the shares rose 8 in early trading. However, the accompanying chairman's statement cast doubts on improvement in the second half. The shares slipped back to close 2 off at B69p. Suggestions at an analysts meeting of a possible upturn in WI's UK markets in the first quarter of 1992 lifted the shares 7 to 265p in spite of news of interim profits down 37 per cent at Â£40.1m. Vickers were wanted and the shares firmed 8 to 214p. Dowty gave up 7 to 181p on a reported downgrading from Kleinwort Benson. A squeeze benefited 3M Group, 13 up at 373p. West- and, 5 higher at 140p, contin- ued to be cheered by the com- pany's winning (together with BM) ofthe order for 44 Merlin 1H101 helicopters. News that Hickson Interna- tion was preparin to sell its flooring subsidiar to footwear and fabric group Headlam for Â£10.5m pleased the market and Hilckson was lifted 13 to 206p. Trading in Headlam was suspended at 63p at the com- pany's request. MARKET REPORTERS.

   "text_content" : "STOCK index futures contin- ned to Indicate a positive out- look for UK equities yesterday in spite of a modest setback in the share market on rising turnover in the London deriva- tive markets, writes Jim McCallum. The September FT-SE 100 index contract spent much of the session trading at a pre- mium of around 25 points to the spot index, compared with fair value of approximately 9. Such a high premium reflects the futures markets' belief that London shares can make further gains In spite of alread having advanced to new following the col- lape ofthe coup In the Soviet Union. Part of the reason for the large premium is technical an linked to large arbitrage positions built up in the Sep- tember contract ahead of its expiry at the month's end. The September FT-SE closed 14 lower at 2,m89 with a clos- ing premium of 21 over the spot index. Turnover was swelled by switching into the December contract. In the options market, deal- ing was boosted by a large trade in Sears, with a broker baying 1,000 of both December 80 and December 100 puts and selling 2,000 December 90 puts. There was also a buyer of 8,000 October 2,800 calls.",
