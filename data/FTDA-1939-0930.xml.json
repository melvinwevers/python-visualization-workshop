FRIDAY Evening. There were quite a few interesting features in City circles to-day, among these being the firmer tendency in sterling, the cheap terms upon which the Government borrowed on Treasury bills and a further sharp relapse in silver prices. The result of the Treasury bill tender was below market expectations, but keen outside competition was indicated by the fact that applications totalled no less than Â£96,270,000. All the Â£55,000,000 bills avail- able were allotted at an average rate of discount of Â£2 8s 9.83d per cent., as com- pared with Â£3 6s 1.25d per cent. the previous week. The market syndicate obtained a quota of only 47 per cent. Tenders will be invited next Friday for the reduced amount of Â£50,000,000, but corresponding maturi- ties are only Â£37,000,000. Even prior to the tender the clearing banks had bought December Treasury bills at 2% per cent., but, subsequently, business was reported elsewhere down to 2 per cent. Leading houses quoted 2%-2% per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts, but it is doubtful whether the lower level was fully effective in competi- tion. Short loan conditions remained extremely easy and fresh overnight accom- modation was available at 1% per cent. in outside quarters. LOANAs DIcoUNT PE1 ClAT. PER CENT.

A further sharp fall was seen in silver prices, both spot and forward delivery being %d down at 22%4d and 22'/,d per ounce respectively. Selling by speculators caused this fall, but subsequently there was speculative buy- ing. It is believed that the Indian Govern- ment has withdrawn from the market for the moment. Sterling Firmer In the foreign exchanges sterling was again adjusted upwards in terms of cer- tain official currencies. 'The sterling- dollar rate remained at $4.03 middle, but the Belgian belga weakened to 23.77%, Dutch guilders to 7.55 and Swiss francs to 17.75. In the \"free \" market the only altera- tions were in Brazilian milreis and the Shanghai dollar, the former easing to 3%/d and the latter to 4%d. Quotations were announced for two more currencies, Latvian lats and Estonian kroner. Fol- lowing the reduction in Bank Rate, for- ward rates were adjusted slightly more favourably to sterling.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 29th Sept. The Stock Market closed easy after a very dull session. Net losses generally ranged from fractions to $1, but falls in Steels and Chemicals reached $2. Turn- over only totalled 1,130,000 shares-440,00n fewer than yesterday. The opening tone was heavy, with Steels under pressure. After the initial selling wave, support, including some replace- t ment buying, notably Motors, lifted prices substantially above their low levels. The volume, however, contracted, and a long list was still anything to $1 lower by midday. In the early afternoon the rally was slightly extended, reducing most losses to fractions. Coppers and Utilities were neglected, but Rails, Chemicals and Air- crafts were easy. Motors responded to Ward's estimate of higher production this week. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing c average declined 0.96 to 150.16, Rails 0.71 to 34.31, Utilities 0.26 to 24.83. Dealings comprised 832 stocks, of which 574 de- clined, 109 improved and 149 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Govts. ad- vanced, but Rails eased. Sales were $10,120,000, against $13,000,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index was 168.3, against 169.8 yesterday. Railroad freight loadings for the week to 23rd September totalled 814,800 cars, an increase of 9,100 on the week and of 139,200 over a year ago to the highest since 1937.

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange opened yester- day morning under the shadow of the Russian bear, who was seen as stretch- ing out his claws in all directions from the Baltic to the Balkans-and, accord- ing to the congenital pessimists, even farther. Yet once again the investing public and the House itself faced the latest developments with admirable philo- sophy and unruffled calm. Partly because it was Friday, selling orders were less easy to execute than on the previous day. On the other hand, several leading Industrials regained early losses. Gilt-Edged and Money Continued demand for Conversion Four and a-Half demonstrated im- plicit confidence that Government will be able to carry on with its cheap money policy for, anyway, a very long time to come. This particular stock- which can be redeemed on 1st July next and must be redeemed by 1944- rose 4 further to 102, or 14 above the minimum. Mr. J. M. Keynes's plea that the Treasury should \"find methods of borrowing during the war at an average rate of interest not exceeding 21 per cent.\" aroused much discussion, in some cases of an embittered character. With income and surtax ranging from 7s 6d to 16s in the Â£, it was complained more or less violently that this economist's rate of interest would not constitute a living wage for money. Theory and Practice Theoretically in a closed economy Government has a giant's strength to control and restrict prices and interest, but it would be tyrannical to use such powers to the full. Certainly it would hardly be possible to borrow long-term at 3 per cent. without either first forc- ing up the level of existing stocks or using an undesirable measure of com- pulsion. Nevertheless, by borrowing short on as large a scale as possible and post- poning the projected loan issues until the reservoir of savings has been filled to overflowing-by such a policy of biding his time the Chancellor may quite probably borrow at much nearer Mr. Keynes's average than would at first sight seem on the cards. In Brief Home Rails suffered a modest relapse yesterday on the overnight statement by the Minister of Transport that dis- cussions as to the compensation to be paid to the companies remained uncompleted. Canadian Pacific Non-Cumulative Preference (sterling) stock was again bought at up to 30. The market esti- mates that the full 4 per cent. is now being earned, but does not look for a restart of dividend payments until early next year. Anglo-Iranian were the black spot of the day. The company's properties in Iran and Iraq are obviously situated in potential storm centres. At the close yesterday Iranians were being offered at 56s 3d, against a peak this year of 98s 9d, so that it would seem that any possible perils have now been pretty well discounted. Shell were only a fraction easier yesterday at 81s 3d. Before the war their best price this year was 90s bid. A fortnight ago the units were up to 92s 6d. This week 50,000 to 60,000 Shell must have been sold and yet the price has not gone below Â£4. At that limit first-class investment support appears to be attracted. hor itarits",

   "text_content" : "FRIDAY Evening. The course of Stock Exchange values to-day was largely a repetition of yesterday's movements. Markets opened very dull, but the tone im- proved later, and a large part of initial losses was recovered before the close. Quotations were marked down in the morning as a precautionary measure in view of the implications of the Russo-German announcement. Sell- ing was light, however, and further consideration of the announcement pro duced a more hopeful atmosphere. The price recovery, however, was only partial, and most quotations show a decline on balance. The total of bargains recorded in all markets was 2,205, against 1,931 yester- day. Conditions in the gilt-edged market showed practically no change, the rise in income-tax and uncertainty regarding the war borrowing programme again imped- ing activity. Sales at minimum prices remained almost impossible, except where buyers were prepared to pay a relatively high price for short-dated stock taken for reinvestment of sale proceeds. Deals of this type were reflected in special marks in Conversion 4% per cent. up to 104. The quotation for normal busi ness, however, was % higher again at 102, against a minimum of 100%. Another notable feature of the record of business done was the marking of Conver- sion Fives at 105, or 1% above the fixed quotation. Gilt-edged prices Page 4 CHINESE LOANS DOWN Business in the Foreign Bond market remained extremely quiet and few price movements were recorded. The news of the Russo-German peace proposals stimu- lated a little speculative inquiry for German bonds and the 5 per cent. issue was marked 1 point higher at 6. Similar considerations imparted a somewhat firmer tendency to Belgians and the 4 per cent. 1936 issue was 1 point up at 52. Elsewhere scattered buying orders for Argentines were easily satisfied at over- night prices. The day's international developments were interpreted as a bear point for Chinese bonds and losses up to 3 points were recorded. The Boxer loan closed at 30, as compared with 33 previ- ously, and 4% per cent. 1898 and the 5 per cent. 1913 issues wbre each 2 points easier at 40 and 26% respectively. Foreign bond prices Page 4 RAILS ABOVE WORST In common with other sections of the Stock Exchange the Home Rail market was quieter. Prices were marked down sharply at the opening, but the movement was one of sentiment rather than a result of selling pressure. Little week-end profit-taking was reported, although there was some disappointment at the absence of any announcement of Government com- pensation plans. During the day a par- tial recovery took place, and closing quo- tations were in many cases above the worst. Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary fell % a point to 58 in the morn- ing, but subsequently recovered to 58%. Great Western Ordinary were finally 1 point down at 29 and L.M.S. suffered a net loss of % at 11%. Prior charges lost part of the headway made during the week, but selling for profit-taking appeared to be small. L.M.S. 4 per cent. remained comfortably above the minimum price at 54, after being 53%Y earlier in the day. The 4 per cent. 1923 issue were also 1% points lower at 35Y. and L.N.E.R. 4 per cent. First Prefer- ence shed 2 points at 29. In the Foreign Rail group conditions were quiet, but the few changes that were recorded showed an easy tendency. Argentine issues continued to receive a little support and remained for the most part unaltered, although B.A. Great Southern were % a point off at 9. Anto- fagasta met with some selling and dropped %, to close at 8%. Yesterday's buying orders for Canadian Pacific appeared to be completed, and the stock suffered a fall to 6%. Following Wall Street the Ameri- can Rail market opened easily and most quotations lost ground. Home and Foreign Rail prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS INACTIVE Steadier in Places After a Weakish Opening Business was very quiet in the Indus- trial market and the tone opened dull, with prices in the main showing an easier ten- dency. The Russian news created an unfavourable atmosphere and naturally tended to restrain enterprise, but it in- spired no nervous selling. Realisations were light and no weakness developed. Later the trend became steadier on some quiet inquiry for shares, and prices were inclined to go better towards the end. The late improvement continued among Brewery shares, but it was not general. Tobaccos were reactionary but rallied, with the exception of British-American, which were depressed mildly by world con- ditions. A few Steel and Aircraft shares attracted some inquiry. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 84.3, against 85.2. In general, BANKING shares were reac- tionary after the late improvement, and apart from Midland part-paid, % lower, recessions ranged from Is to 2s each. Exceptionally, National Provincial (14s paid) were firm, being favoured at 39s. Chartered of India and Union of Australia were each % lower. INSURANCE issues re- mained idle, with Northern and Scottish Union \" A \" each % easier. Some down- ward readjustments were made in quota- tions of INVESTMENT TRUST stocks. Some attempts to realise ELECTRIC SUPPLY securities caused prices to be lowered sharply in a few directions. Metro- \"olitan changed down to 32s 9d and were uoted Is 6dlower at 34s. British Powers closed Is 6d down at 21s, at which busi- ness was reported. Crompton Parkinsons attracted up to 15s 6d and English Electrics at 28s; other- wise ELECTRICAL issues were dull, with Ever R\"ady and G.E.C. 6d easier. Leading MoTOr were inactive, and no quotable changes were made, apart from firmness of Napiers at 5s 9d in sympathy with AIR- caArA issues. Among these, Bristols were .6d better at 15s and Hawker Siddeleys harder at 12s. Dealings in. Triplex Glass ranged from 23s to 24s 3d. Changes among SHIPPING issues were a matter of a few pence either way. Cable and Wireless stocks drooped and Canadian Marconis were 3d easier. Moderate demand was experienced for low-priced IRON and STEEL shares and rices were a shade firmer for Baldwins, Consetts, Richard Thomas and Richardsons Westgarth. John Browns found support at 25s 6d and B.S.A. at 23s. Vickers and United Steels were 3d easier. Bolsover Collieries and Wm. Cory improved, while Staveleys were favoured up to 39s 6d. Several MANUFACTURING issues turned easier, such as Murex, Turner and Newall United Molasses and Pinchin Johnsons, Yesterday's rise of 9d in Imperial Chemi- cals induced some selling and the shares changed down to 2(s 4/sd, closing at 27s with a net loss of 6d. A rise of 7Vd to 20s 7%d occurred in British Plaster Board. On the preliminary statement re- turning a heavy net loss, Electric and Musical were lowered 9d to 7s 3d; the selling was small. TEXTILES were dull, with Coats 6d off at 24s 3d and Lancashire Cottons changing at 12s 6d. Fine Spinners rose 3d to 3s 6d on moderate buying. RAYONS were feature- less except for a fresh rise of 6d to 18s 6d in British Celanese First Preference. American were lower. Courtaulds closed dull at 25s 9d. Comparative steadiness characterised STORES. Marks and Spencer were %' firmer and Woolworths attracted up to 55s 7/d. Whiteley changed at 5s 6d. Boots Drug were dealt in from 33s 1%d to 35s 3d. Weak in TOBAccOS was British-Ameri- can, down .o to 4. Imperials also opened lower, but after 5V rallied to 5%, which left them only /, lower. In BREWERIES, Meux were Is better at 21s and a few other gains ranged from 6d to is 3d. Guinness and City of London Preferred were down 2s 6d each. Dis- tillers reacted Is 6d to 86s. Tate and Lyle and Lever & Unilever Preference were better. Hudson's Bays were fd easier in LAND shares. American Industrials showed an easier tendency, Bethlehems being 113, Chrysler 105, General Motors 65, U.S. Steels 92Y, and Nickels 45%. Industrial share prices Page 4 RUBBERS DULL The Rubber share market remained dull in the absence of business. An advance in the commodity from 9%d to 9%d during Stock Exchange hours brought in a few buyers of florin issues, some of which closed the turn harder. Cheviot rose from 2s 10%d to 3s, and Narborough advanced from Is 2%d to Is 3d. Malayalam, on the other hand, were bought for investment, and added 3d at 27s 9d. In Mincing Lane Rubber shares were again quiet. Rubber Trust finished at 27s, Anglo-Java 6%d and United Serdang 3s. Stock Exchange prices for Tea shares were dull, but some support was noticeable at the lower levels recently established. Price movements were few, but usually downward. Limbuguri were weak, a seller appearing and depressing the price from 36s 3d to 35s. Rubber Prices Page 4 LOWER LEVELS FOR OILS Oil shares suffered the fate of other sec- tions of the House and closed with a general decline in prices.

   "text_content" : "Some investors are perturbed by the thought of a special tax on the incre#se of wealth during the war; or, in other words, the prospect of a capital levy. Nothing can be done until the advent of peace. If the aim is to take the profit out of war, the authorities may have diffi- culty in attributing any increment in the market values of Industrial and Home Railway securities entirely to war conditions. Scope for appreciation in Industrial shares is now very much restricted by the taxation burdens on industry. Profits are subject to N.D.C., Arma- ments Profits Duty and E.P.T., as the case may be, and from any surplus 7s 6d in the Â£ is deducted for income- tax. Since the State claims the lion's share of profits above certain amounts, the war profiteer belongs to the past. Confidence as Factor There are other major difficulties. Will the authorities take the market values of an investor's securities im- mediately before the war and assess any increment when peace is pro- claimed as the war accumulation? Security values prior to the declara- tion of war had been depreciating steadily. Reference to THE FINANCIAL TIMES indices shows that on 31st August the index for Home Rails was 41.6, against the 1938 average of 51.6, Industrials 96.6, against 105.5, and Gold Mines 194.3, against 206.3. It would not be a misstatement to assert that the holdings (other than gilt-edged) of the majority of inves- tors show depreciation of 20 per cent. and more on purchasing prices. Any improvement in values during war surely will be more in the nature of a partial recovery as confidence returns than inflation of prices due directly to war. Tobacco and Brewery Shares Business on the Stock Exchange con- tinues narrow and investors are adopt- ing a cautious attitude in view of the developments in Eastern Europe. The effect of the increase in income-tax has been to create a demand for tax-free Preference shares, but the supply is so limited that only small lots are avail- able at prices that scarcely can be regarded as attractive. Good-class Industrial equities are in quiet demand, particularly those of companies not to any extent directly handling war supplies. Tobacco and Brewery shares are expected to come into favour when markets are cheered by some really good war news. It is not thought that the higher duties will prove onerous. Home Rails Again The suggestion in this column a week ago that Home Railway stocks possess speculative possibilities for the near future has been realised in the gains of 5 to 8 points secured among the popular issues. Southern Preferred Ordinary, ad- vised a week ago around 50. are now 58. Assuming the full 5 per cent. dividend is forthcoming, this stock would still be cheap, but unless busi- ness generally broadens, a temporary reaction seems probable in view of the extent of this week's rises. rritaf",

   "text_content" : "4Satisfaction will be derived from the confirmation by Mr. Hudson, Secretary for the Overseas Trade De- partment, of the Government's desire to continue the work of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Apart from the exclusion of trade with enemy territory, British traders will thus be able to obtain export credit guarantees for the promotion of busi- ness with overseas markets as in the past. It is not to be expected that there will be the same latitude regard- ing the duration of credit covered by such guarantees in view of the greater risks which are now involved in trad- ing with certain parts of the world. Nevertheless, Mr. Hudson's reply to Mr. Pethick-Lawrence regarding the apprehension felt by British traders over the risk of not being able to obtain payment in sterling in respect of exports to European neutrals was adequately reassuring. It was to the effect that the Government was pre- pared to continue existing arrange- ments for guaranteeing sterling pay- ments and transfers in respect of U.K. expdrts to most European neutral countries. That such guarantees will be avail- able for sales on cash terms or short- term credit is natural enough. Trans- actions of this kind alone are properly insurable, in that the Department can effectively spread the risks involved. Such business is, in fact, almost entirely self-liquidating. The same thing does not apply, of course, to the medium credits, which have been one of the most successful of the Department's activi- ties. Seeing that these particular credits have in the past turned out to be in the nature of short-dated foreign loans, it is evident that fresh commit- ments in this field are unlikely to be undertaken other than in exceptional circumstances. While the Export Credits Guarantee Department may not be ex- pected to function as fully as in peace- time, it has, nevertheless, many useful services to render British exporters by way of covering current sales to over- seas markets. There is no need to stress at this point the importance of maintaining, and indeed increasing, our foreign trade. In so far as exports constitute the principal means by which this country has to pay for its purchases of war and civilian imports from abroad, they constitute a vital weapon of national economic defence. In what manner our foreign trade policy should be prosecuted will become clearer when the demands of the various Ministries, including that of Supply, have been sorted out. At the moment the problem is to ascertain how far British industries can be made to pro- duce over and above the national defence requirements for export pur- poses. Naturally, the line has to be drawn somewhere, for our military and economic objectives are now closely related to each other. What is certain is that if industry can produce the goods it should have little difficulty now in selling them in foreign markets.",

   "text_content" : "The exact position of the Electric and Musical Industries group is not assessable from the preliminary figures for the past year. A net loss of Â£132,000 is reported, against a profit of Â£146,500, but both amounts are subject to important qualifica- tions. Twelve months ago the total included Â£81,900, received in connec- tion with the sale of certain shares, but at the same time consisting largely of profits previously undistri- buted. This exceptional and specific receipt has as its opposite number this time exceptional allowances for contingencies. The only indication of their nature forthcoming so far is that they are due to the international situa- tion, while their amount is not stated. In any case, the actual trading posi- tion would seem to be less unsatisfac- tory than a superficial comparison of the two net figures would suggest. A year of such political unrest as that which separated the Munich Agree- ment and the declaration of war could not be other than unfavourable for the luxury side of the group's business represented by such things as wireless sets and gramophones. On the other hand, the Government work for which the companies' special experience fits them was not expected to have got into its full stride in time to give maximum help to the financial year just ended. No doubt it has been speeded up since.",

   "text_content" : "The interim dividend of 15 per cent., an increase of 5 per cent., now declared by G. D. Peters and Co., should adequately compensate shareholders for the postponement of the interim pay- ment usually made in July. The altera- tion in the date was decided upon in order to make a half-year's interval be- tween the interim and final dividends, the latter being announced in March. The increase accords well with expec- tations, for market talk puts current profits ahead of those of last year, when record results were obtained. The company is engaged mainly in the manufacture of rolling stock equip- ment. Last year's profits were helped by the London Passenger Transport Board's heavy purchases of rolling stock, for which this company supplied coupling and automatic door apparatus. Similar orders may not have been on the same scale in the current period, but in other directions it is understood the business is doing very well. The in- crease in the interim dividend promises well for the final payment, which was 15 per cent. last time. The 5s shares are quoted at Â£1, several shillings under the high point touched before the out- break of war.",

   "text_content" : "Full details of the Excess Profits Tax of 60 per cent. outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during his Budget speech were made known in the Finance (No. 2) Bill issued last night. The new levy follows broadly the lines of the now defunct Armaments Profit Duty, which it replaces, but applies to all trades and businesses. As in the case of N.D.C., Stock Exchange members come within its scope. The tax will be charged on standard profits fixed by refer- ence to profits of a standard period, the trader having the choice of accounting years, and will be computed, subject to certain modi- fications, on the same principles which govern the computation of profits for income-tax purposes. The National Defence Contribution is being retained in so far as tax will be levied under N.D.C. or E.P.T., whichever is the higher. In the case of trades or businesses commenced on or before 1st July, 1936, standard profits for a full year will be the amount in one standard year, and, where the standard period is two years, half the amount of those profits. If the average amount of capital em ployed in any chargeable accounting period is greater or less than the average amount in the standard period, standard profits for a full year will be increased, or decreased, accordingly. Busifesses commenced on or before 1st January, 1935, will have the option to take the accounting years of either 1935 and 1936, 1935 and 1937, or 1936 and 1937. STANDARD YEARS Traders' Option Where business was begun after 1st January, 1935, and on or before 1st January, 1936, the standard period also at the option of the trader will be 1936 or thatand the following year, while for trades commenced after 1st January, 1936, and on or before 1st July in that year, the standard period will be such consecutive period of twelve months ending not later than the end of June, 1937, as the trader may select. The Board of Referees will have power, if satisfied that in the standard period the rate of profit or the volume of business was less than might then have been reason- ably expected, to direct that the standard pro its for a full year be ascertained as if the profits for the standard period were such greater amount as they think just. This is subject to the proviso that in the case of a company the amount shall not exceed that necessary to provide divi- dends for the standard period of 6 per cent. per annum in respect of the paid-up SOrdinary share capital, and as respects any other paid-up share capital of the company at the fixed rate per annum payable in respect thereof, unless the Board is satisfied that owing to some specific cause peculiar to the trade or busi- ness it is just that a greater amount should be allowed. So far as busineAses are concerned which [began after 1st July, 1936. the standard profits for a full year, in relation to any chargeable accounting period, will be the lstatutory percentage of the average .amount of the capital employed in that period. This percentage is defined as 8 per cent. in relation to a trade or business carried on by a body corporate (other than a company in which the directors have a controlling interest); and 10 per cent. in relation to a trade or business not so carried on, provided that in relation to any decrease of capital the statutory percent- age will in all cases be 6 per cent. Where a partnership or a company in which the directors have a controlling interest is concerned the minimum amount which may be declared as the standard profit is fixed at the greater sum, not ex- ceeding Â£3,000, as is arrived at by allowing Â£750 for each working proprietor. Busi- -sses whose standard profits are below ,000 are not affected by the tax. CAPITAL AND PROFITS WeComputation Principle Provision is made for the computation of profits and capital. The average amount of capital employed will be taken to be, so far as it consists of assets acquired by purchase on or after the commencement of the business, the price at which they were acquired, subject to deductions where assets consist of debts due to the person carrying on the trade or business. The value of any assets other than a debt will be subject to a deduction of any sum contributed, directly or indirectly, by the State towards the acquisition of the asset; for wear and tear or for depreciation. Relief will be afforded in respect of de- ficiency of profits if they are less than the standard profits, or if a loss is sustained in the chargeable accounting period. The amount of the deficiency will be taken to be, where profits have been made, the amount by which the profits fall short of standard profits, and where a loss has been sustained the amount of the loss added to the amount of the standard profits. Where a deficiency of profits occurs in any chargeable accounting period in any trade or business, the profits chargeable with excess profits tax will be deemed to be reduced, and relief will be granted by reducing by the amount of the deficiency the aggregate amount of the profits chargeable for the previous chargeable accounting periods. Where the deficiency exceeds the aggregate amount of profits chargeable for previous accounting periods, the balance of the deficiency will be applied in reducing any profits subject to tax for the next accounting period, and so on. In the case of inter-connected companies, capital employed in, and profits and losses arising from the business of the subsidiary company will be treated as one with those of the parent company. A subsidiary is defined as a corporate body if not less than nine-tenths of its Ordinary share capital is owned by another corporate body, whether directly or indirectly. The accounting period for the purposes of the tax is fixed as any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April. 1939.",

   "article_dc_title" : "City and War Loan Issue Date",
   "text_content" : "City discussion of the timing of the Government's war borrowing programme was stimulated by Sir John Simon's further statement (published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday). Replying to the Budget debate on Thursday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the time was rapidly approaching when bor- rowing plans must be announced. This statement was held in some quar- ters yesterday to modify Sir John's state- ment in his Budget speech that the time for borrowing had not yet come. Indivi- dual interpretations of the Chancellor's words led to a good deal of variation in Stock Exchange estimates of the time that will elapse before a War Loan is launched. As short a time as a fortnight was sug- gested in some quarters, as a possibility, but something over a month was the more usual estimate. It is held that several weeks at least would have to be taken before the ground could be sufficiently prepared for a big loan issue. An obvious preliminary to any such operation would be an unfreez- ing of the gilt-edged market, and presum- ably the creation of conditions in which minimum prices could be abandoned either with or without the assistance of a further cut in Bank Rate. In addition, steps to render the bank- ing system more absorptive of a new loan may well be considered necessary. So far, money is being raised comfortably by the Government on Treasury bills, now being taken at a much lower rate. Further expansion of the issue would be quite easy and might be considered desirable. On the other hand, too long a wait be- fore borrowing is undertaken would bring the heavy January tax demands too near for the creation of really favourable loan conditions. This consideration alone sug- gests that a loan operation will be under- taken well before the end of the year, and many City observers consider Novem- ber the most likely month.",

   "text_content" : "Steel prices may be raised after 31st October, the date until which they have been stabilised under a recent Government Order. Some increase may be found unavoidable as the prices of numerous materials required by steel manufacturers-from timber to aluminium-have been raised well above the pre-war level. Observers within the industry are somewhat perturbed at what is de- scribed as the dual principle apparent in the Government's schemes for price regulation. They point out that in many trades over which a control system had to be superimposed after the outbreak of war, prices were fixed at levels which made allowance for higher war risk insurance costs and which reflected the buying rush conse- quent upon the outbreak of hostilities. ON PRE-WAR BASIS By contrast, in the steel industry and in other trades which were already subject to rigid centralised control there has been no change in the price levels which were calculated on a pre-war basis. The impending re-examination of steel- makers' costs may be expected to show increases in the charges for numerous raw materials, particularly those, such as ore and scrap, which are imported in large quantities from abroad. As output is running at the peak of capacity, no counteracting economies may be antici- pated from a fuller use of plant. Thus the case for passing some part of the addi- tional cost on to the consumer may well find approval in official quarters.",

In numerous cases the wisdom of the companies in refusing suggestions that branch lines and other services which formerly were barely, or not at all, re- munerative should be closed down is being proved. Branch lines are now carrying a heavy volume of traffic and in many instances are proving of vital importance. Programmes of works which the com- panies had in hand at the outbreak of war are being reviewed. In most cases it has been decided to proceed only with those of urgent importance. In common with others, the railways have difficulties to contend with in the securing of supplies of materials and of labour, while it is also necessary that they should retain stocks of essential materials against possible emergency use. Discussions are continuing as to the terms upon which the Government will compensate the companies for the use of their systems during the period of control. A statement will be issued immediately a decision has been reached.",

   "text_content" : "The result of the weekly Treasury bill tender yesterday was a big disappointment to the Money market. Keen outside com- petition and expectations of a further cut in Bank Rate were the contributory factors. Applications rose by nearly Â£10,000,000 to Â£96,270,000-the highest since 4th March, 1938, when tenders for Â£45,000,000 bills amounted to Â£97,810,000. It has to be borne in mind that the Exchange Fund now holds nearly all the early October bill maturities, and tenders by the Fund doubtless contributed to yes- terday's result. It is believed, too, that clearing banks tendered on behalf of clients. All the Â£55,000,000 of bills available were allotted at an average rate of dis- count of Â£2 8s 9.83d per cent., or almost a full 1 per cent. below the previous week's average. The cut in Bank Rate has there- fore been given full rein, and a further fall in the official minimum is anticipated. As a result of the big outside applica- tions, the market syndicate obtained the disappointing quota of only 45 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "The thirty-sixth ordinary general meet- ing of Thos. Ward, Ltd., was held yester- day at the Royal Victoria Hotel; Sheffield. Ms. Jos. WARD, LL.D., J.P. (the chair- man), who presided, referred to the great loss sustained by the company in the death of his son, William A. Ward, who was assistant managing director, and of Mr. Albert Senior, local director. Mr. W. A. Ward had been with the company 31 years. He had an unique practical knowledge of mechanical and electrical engineering. To fill the vacancies of the Board the directors had elected Mr. J. Bussey as full director and Mr. C. A. Lee had been made a local director. Both Mr. Bussey and Mr. Lee had been made directors of Thos. Smith and Sons, Ltd. Continuing the Chairman said: Once again our country has taken a stand for freedom and liberty, qualities so vitally important for the ultimate peace of the world. Your company is doing its utmost in many directions to help forward the production and distribu- tion of materials for national work and will embrace every opportunity of helping the Government to achieve its object. You will be interested to know that our assistant managing director, Mr. George Wood, has been appointed Deputy-director of Scrap Supplies under the Ministry of Supply and a number of our directors and managers are rendering very useful service in posi- tions they are well able to fill. In presenting the thirty-sixth balance- sheet my first remarks must have reference to the very great honour that has been conferred on Mr. Ashley S. Ward, joint managing director, by his appointment to the office of Master Cutler, which dignity will be bestowed upon him on Tuesday next. He will worthily uphold that important office and maintain its high credentials. The company has now passed its diamond jubilee year. The brochure pub- lished to mark this event has been received with great favour by over 14,000 friends; acknowledgments have conveyed their best wishes for the continued success and prosperity of the firm. CONTROL OF THOS. SMITH AND SONS We have taken a controlling interest in Thos. Smith an\"' Sons Rodley, Ltd., Leeds, established in 1820. They are well-known loco overhead and dock crane and excava- tor manufacturers of the country. We have had business connections with the firm for over half a century and, being closely allied with our loco and crane con- tractors plant department, negotiations were concluded by our acquiring 75 per cent. of the Ordinary shares of Messrs. Smith's. We have become the sole agents for Messrs. Smith's products for many parts of Great Britain and certain coun- tries abroad and have every reason to believe this development will not only strengthen our manufacturing interests- a marked feature of the last 15 years-but will give us an added source of revenue. Our large operations in scrap iron and steel continue. The importance of this industry needs no further recommendation on my part as it is now acknowledged as one of the most vital materials in the manufacture of iron and steel and its con- trol a very necessary part of the organi- sation of the British Iron and Steel Corporation. I am still confident that it would be a very wise policy for all our steelworks to increase . largely their storage accommodation for scrap to aug- ment supplies whenever the opportunity offers. I regret to say that our shipbreaking operations have been anything but satis- factory and to-day the majority of our ship dismantling works are idle through lack of tonnage for demolition; unfortun- ately the position is not likely to improve under present conditions. mÂ· Â·Â·Â· I Â· Â·Â· C The rail department have had an exceed- ingly busy year, having supplied large quantities of rails and accessories of all descriptions to many large works and col- lieries. They have been particularly busy in supplying and laying railway sidings in all parts of the country. The Darlington Railway Plant and Foundry Company, Ltd., have had a successful year and are working in close co-operation with our rail depart- ment. A very large order book for switches and crossings and turnouts of all descriptions will keep them fully occupied for a considerable time. Our machinery department has shown a good turnover with satisfactory results. The Midland Iron Company and Low Moor Best Yorkshire Iron, Ltd., both of which felt the falling off in trade in the early months 'f the year, have neverthe- less been able to show a fair return upon our investments and to-day are very busily occupied. The results of the year's trading of George Cooper and Sons are favourable. Ketton Portland Cement Company, Ltd., has had a very successful year and full year's dividends were received by the Ketton Company from its investments in Ribblesdale Cement, Ltd. Shareholders would be interested to know that while the tonnage was a little less than last year the turnover of the business with that of the subsidiary and associated companies was over six million. Referring to the balance-sheet, the Chairman said: Our reserve fund is Â£135,000, which we propose increasing to Â£150,000. The amount of our liquid assets is two million, while our creditors are only Â£610,213. YEAR'S PROFIT The net profit after writing off deprecia- tion and making full provision for income- tax and N.D.C., directors' salaries and in- terest is Â£150,965. Your directors have no hesitation in saying that the volume of reserves and carry-forward apart from the increased value of investment securities places the company in the strongest financial position it has ever held. The developments mentioned and the increas- ing importance of our operations in many directions, with the full confidence of many patrons, enfold a feature of greatest satis- faction to us. The Chairman in conclusion paid a high tribute to the indefatigable labours and loyal service of his colleagues on the Board and thanked the local directors, managers, representatives, staff and workmen for their services. Mr. Ashley S. Ward, joint managing director, said that the company's interest in Marshalls Gainsboro had been enlarged to the benefit of both concerns. From the few hundred men they had when the reorganisation took place they had developed until they had upwards of two thousand men employed. While being pretty fully employed on dismantling work during the year there had been no very major operations except that they had acquired the works of the Triumph Com- pany at Coventry, together with the whole of that company's assets. Mr. Geo. Wood, assistant managing director, said the reductions in the prices of scrap for steel making were substantial, averaging about 8s 6d per ton, about 15 per cent. of its total value; but despite that when the renewals of demand came in 1939 they as a firm and the country as a whole were able to provide large sup- plies for those defence purposes which were now so necessary to our existence. He could truthfully claim that the scheme of control of scrap supplies to the steel manufacturers had worked very success- fully. The report and accounts were approved and the dividends recommended declared. _Â· Â·Â· _ _ _",
