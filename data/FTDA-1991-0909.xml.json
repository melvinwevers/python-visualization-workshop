   "article_dc_title" : "Ec Concern over Latest Proposals for Emu",
   "text_content" : "By David Buchan and David Gardner in Brussels PRESSURE is growing among European Community mem- bers for changes to proposals on European monetary union put forward by the Dutch pres- idency of the EC last week. These are due to be discussed by finance ministers in Brus- sels today. Italy in particular is con- cerned that tough economic conditions should not be imposed on countries wishing to participate in a European currency union. The European Commission has joined Italy in expressing concern that Dutch proposals increase the prospect of a two-speed move to Emu. The core proposal of the Dutch government, which has always aligned itself closely with Germany on monetary policy, is that economic con- vergence must precede mone- tary union. Specifically, it suggests that, when the transitional second stage of Emu is reviewed in 1996, no state should be eligible to enter the currency union, unless for the previous two years it had kept its inflation rate close to that achieved by the best-performing state. It must also have avoided \"exces- sive\" budget deficits and kept within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism without recourse to devaluation. The Dutch paper also implies that convergence along these lines must have lasting credi- bility in the eyes of the sinan- cial markets. The Dutch claimed that, when these proposals were dis- cussed by senior officials of the Twelve last week, they only drew serious criticism from Greece. But Italy, it seems, and per- haps other southern countries worried about being left behind by the north, may have been holding their political fire for today's ministerial debate. France's position will be cru- cial, but French officials said they had no idea what line their finance minister, Mr Pierre Bdregovoy, would take. Italy and the Commission complain that the Dutch paper's strict convergence cri- teria also depart from the Octo- ber 1990 Rome agreement out- lining plans for a European central bank in 1994. This agreement was never sup- ported by the UTK and has been questioned by Gtrmany. The Dutch paper proposes a European Monetary Institute for the transitional stage of Emu, with the European cen- tral bank only being estab- lished after the final decision to create Emu has been taken. The general feeling in Brus- sels is that events in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe make it all the more important to finish the intergovernmental conferences on Emu and politi- cal union this year. \"We can't dNitorld Commnnt......Page 14 move into 1992, with so much happening in the world, still gazing at our navels,\" said one ambassador. This sense of urgency explains why France has been so bitterly attacked by many of its partners for failure to put geopolitics ahead of its farming interests. France believes the Commis- sion is trying to bounce the EC into accepting its plan for the overhaul of the Common Agri- cultural Policy, using as its weapons negotiations with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the need to bind eastern Europe more closely to the EC. Paris badly misjudged the mood prevailing after events in the Soviet Union and was left isolated last week, even though countries such as Ireland have similar misgivings. Mr Uffe Ellemann Jensen, the Danish foreign minister who called for a European summit to endorse the Com- mission's concessions to Hun- gary, Poland and Czechoslo- vakia, called the French attitude \"a disgrace\". \"Certain countries make fine statements about Europe and democracy, but when it comes to small concessions and con- fronting their own vested inter- ests, they behaved as if they are living on another planet,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Martin and Richard Watera SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank caught up in allegations that its trad- ers rigged US government securities auctions, says the scandal has lost it few clients. Mr Deryck Maughan, appointed as chief operating officer of Salomon Brothers last month, said yesterday that 24 of the bank's 27 most impor- tant fixed-interest clients worldwide continued to do active business with Salomon's trading desks. Of the remaining three, one - the World Bank - has suspended business with Sao- mon Brothers until the end of this month, when it will review the new management's clean-up efforts. Another, the California state pension fund, is not dealing with the firm on government secrities, but is still on a mortgage4backed ui and equities. The third is not investing in bonds at the moment. Similarly, said Mr Maughan, Taskhg o magger at of Sdlm ........................Page 17 92 of the firm's 100 top equity- trading clients are continuing to trade actively with it. In investment banking, there had been one well-publicised lors of business - the UK Treasury's decision last week to drop Salomon from the sale of the government's remaining stake in British Telecom, due in November. \"I think that decision was largely taken on UK domestic grounds,\" said Mr Maughan, rather than because the US authorities had warned the British government against using Salomon Brothers, or because its ability to find homes for the shares in the US had been harmed. \"Corporate America is sticking with us.\" Mr Magan visited London at the weekend to talk to UK- based sta, dclients, and sinan- cial authorities. Salomon Brothers' future depends on the penalties the US regulators decide to impose. \"If the government takes away your licences, you're out of business,\" said Mr Maughan. \"If it levies a fine out of all proportion to history and your capital base and the crime, you're out of business.\" He did not think US regula- tors wanted to put the firm out of business, however. Mr Maughan did not rule out the possibility that further damaging disclosures about the firm's past activities might emerge during the investiga- tions. The new management's knowledge of what had taken place was based entirely on what those involved had told it; a government investigation had greater powers than the firm so it might find out more, he said. So far, however, \"we have suffered some reputation dam- age but I would say our ftran- chise is essentially preserved at this point\".",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor Confident: Paddy Ashdown yesterday said the morale of Labour supporters was declining MR Neil Kinnock toughened his party's stance on nuclear disarmament and currency devaluation yesterday as the Labour party was joined by the Liberal Democrats in challeng- ing Mr John Major to call an autumn general election. Senior ministers insisted that the government did not see its recent opinion poll recovery as a trigger for a November election. But they acknowledged that election fever would be fuelled by an optimistic assessment of the economic outlook in a speech by Mr Major later today, when he will reiterate his view that the recession is over. In spite of Treasury caution, some cabinet ministers see the chance of another cut in inter- est rates before next month's Conservative party conference. The return to the domestic political battleground was marked by the opening yester- day of the annual party confer- ence season with the Liberal Democrats gathering in Bournemouth. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, in positive mood after the Liberal Democrats' recent stronger showing in the opinion polls, declared that falling Labour support meant the Liberal Democrats offered the only realistic alternatives to the \"failed policies of the Conservatives\". He cited a letter from Mr Jeff Rooker, a Labour backbench MP, calling for a deal with the Liberal Democrats, as evidence of a slump in the morale of Mr Kinnock's supporters. But even as senior party fig- ures admitted that his best hope was to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament, Mr Ashdown declined to say whether he would be prepared to make post-election pacts. Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign manager, said the Liberal Democrats were fully prepared for a November elec- tion and ready to fight 632 of the 634 seats which will be con- tested in Great Britain. Mr Kinnock sought to dis- miss the Tories' opinion poll lead as a temporary reflection of Mr Major's recent interna- tional exposure. Another sur- vey yesterday gave the Conser- vatives 41 per cent against Labour's 39 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 15 per cent. Labour plans a determined campaign to shift the focus of voters' concerns back to the economy, lealth and educa- tion.

   "text_content" : "By Our Foreign Staff EEiCUTIVES of the Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional were reported to have been seized by plainclothes policemen at the bank's main ofices in Abu Dhabi yester- day. The bank executives were ftaken away in three police vans, according to witnesses quoted by the Associated Press news agency. Mr Swaleh Naqvi, formerly chief executive of BCCI, has been living in Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, for some months. The BBC reported last night that he was among more than 30 BCCI offi- cials held. In July, Mr Naqvi was indicted in New York, along with BCCI's founder, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, on fraud charges. Witnesses said that the group was taken from the sixth floor which houses the offices of senior executives. There was no official announcement. Banking executives in Abu Dhabi quoted by Associated Press said that the group may have been taken for interroga- tion by a committee which was set up last week to assess BCCI's future. On July 5, the Bank of England shut down BCCI's operations in Britain because of suspected massive fraud. Its attempt to wind up the bank later that month was delayed by a High Court rul- ing in favour of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, which owns more than 77 per cent of BCCI. The High Court gave Abu Dhabi, and its ruler Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, four maoths to come up with a restricturing plan that could revive BCCI. There are approximately 600 employees of BCCI in the United Arab Emirates. More than half of them have filed private claims and petitions against the local receiver, All al-Sharhan, demanding termi- nation payments. They want these to be based on their total length of service. Mr Sharhan won an Abu Dhabi court ruling last week to cut, at least temporarily, the number of employees, by giving them three months leave without pay. London meeting, Page 6",

   "text_content" : "y Mark Nieholson in Moscow THE first chilly days of autumn in Moscow have brought with them a series of dire warnings about food and energy shortages across the Soviet Union this winter, and their possible political conse- quences. The Moscow city council this weekend set up an emergency committee to ensure food sup plies to the capital, with Mr Valentin Karanaukhov, its chairman, saying* \"The cata- strophic situation with food supplies dictates such emer- gency measures.\" Mr Karanaukhov said Moscow might be without any reserves of potatoes this win- ter. His committee was negoti- ating supplies of vegetables with other republics. As part of an emergency response to a prospective food shortage, more than 20,000 Soviet troops have recently been drafted into the country- side around Moscow to help with the harvest. Meanwhile, Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, said at the weekend that fuel stocks for Soviet power sta- tions stood at just 60 per cent of required levels for the win- ter. Oil production in the Soviet Union has fallez to 10m barrels a day this year from levels of 12.5m bid last year, while coal procurement is Just 20 per cent of planned targets. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign min- ister, warned at the weekend US grain sales to the Soviet Union may be halted temporarly because American and foreign bianks have biled to take ip the Bush admlnlstrations offer of loan gu.rlntees to finance the shipments, Lionel Barber writes from Washington. Offdals fear a hlt In sales could further complicate erts toco with a winterfood crisis in the Soviet Unionm. resident Bush said two weeks ago he would make avail- le 81m (Â£186m) out of $500m agricultural loan guaran- tees which had been planned for October 1, but so far the commercial banks have remained wary. With some administration experts forecasting a 25 per cent drop in the Soviet harvest this year, the prospect of large- e emergency assistance is drawing closer. On Friday two relief agency executives told a congressio- nal committee a humanitarian operation 'must start this month if it was to be effective. that a severe winter on top of these shortages would bring \"very serious problems\", adding: \"People could take to the streets spontaneously... very dangerous people could then take centre stage.\" As the Soviet grain harvest enters its last weeks, most Soviet and western officials are expecting a poor yield of around 190m tonnes, against 240m tonnes last year, leading western diplomats in Moscow to estimate that the Soviet Union will need to import between 77m and 110m tonnes this year. The harvest's effective yield will be much lower, however, both because up to 20 per cent of the harvest is traditionally lost to poor transport and stor- age, and .because farmers, increasingly disillusioned with prices and incentives offered from the central authorities, are hoarding grain. As the republics haggle over the terms of their economic ties with each other, and par- ticularly with Russia, supplies of food across the union also risk becoming a political bar- gaining chip. Nevertheless, Mr Vladimir Tikhonov, an academic at the Soviet Agricultural Academy, said in this week's Soyuz mag- azine that the choice of food would be poorer this winter, but said: \"Famine is ruled out - and I say this as someone who knows the situation well.\" Mr Tikhonov said the prob- lem was not lack of production, but inefficient, centralised dis- tribution. \"This country pro- duces 70m tonnes of potatoes a year - as much as China, Britain, Geimany and the US put together. Americans pro- duce 15m tonnes a year, and find this quite sufficient.\""

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels IN their first international negotiation, the Baltic states today start talks in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, with the European Commission on win- ning trade and aid concessions from the EC. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC's external affairs commis- sioner, is to meet representa- tives of the three new coun- tries to discuss their economic needs. The commissioner goes on to Moscow later today, but a team of EC officials will visit Riga and Vilnius this week. The Baltic states' foreign ministers were in Brussels on Friday to tell their counter- parts from the Twelve of their eventual wish to become \"asso- ciated members\" of the Com- munity. \"We are shifting towards the west, towards the EC,\" said Mr Algirdas Sautar- gas, the Lithuanian minister. \"It is too early to discuss mem- bership, but the shift is in that direction.\" Today's talks, however, have a much shorter focus. On offer to the Baltic states are the standard trade and economic co-operation agreements that Brussels now has with east European states. But since Bal- tic trade is still tied to the remaining Soviet republics, the immediate issue is extension of the aid programme of the Group of 24 western industria- lised countries, which is co-or- dinated by Brussels. The EC's initial estimate is, in the words of a Commission paper, that the 8m Bailts will need \"$2bn-$3bn [Â£l.lbn-Â£1.7bn] a year for the three countries taken together, in the form of emergency and technical assis- tance, project loans and bal- ance of payments assistance, including support for the tran- sition to currency convertibil- ity as soon as basic reforms and adjustments programmes have been implemented\".",

Â·~Â·--~--rr *:Â·Â·Â·Â·. ~:: tÂ·Â·:iÂ·l\\~.:Â·k iÂ·~Â·Â·'i~ Â·Â·: Â·~~ :Â· ___ T HE VULTURES are already circling over Mr Gorbachev's gleaming white mansion perched on the Crimean coast. The centre of a momentous political struggle last month, the luxury dacha is now caught in the middle of an economic conflict which illus- trates how much has changed in the 20 days since Mr Boris Yeltsin rescued his old rival from golden captivity in the seaside retreat. At least six different govern- ments are battling for control of Mr Gorbachev's holiday home and the 150 other clinics and sanatoria which form a necklace of privilege around the sunny Crimean coast. The Ukrainian government has put its bid in first, claim- ing all of the Communist party property on its territory. Cri- mea, which declared its sover- eignty last week, would like to get in on the action as well. So would the municipal govern- ment of Yalta (where most of the dachas are), the Russian republic and the central gov- ernment. The final complica- tion is that in Crimea, as in all other regions of the Soviet Union, various republics and republican branches of the Communist party own prop- erty. A microcosm for the compet- ing economic claims which beset a disintegrating Soviet Union, Crimea's dachas also represent the vast land's eco- nomic potential. Crimea - which is like the French Rivi- era without the people, prices or pollution - already plays host to 7m-10m tourists, 100,000 of them foreigners, each year. However, so little tourist revenue stays in Crimea that tourism does not amount to a single percentage point of the region's annual income. Agri- culture accounts for 60 per cent of the economy. Mr Nikolai Bagrov, the local strongman, hopes to change all this: \"This was an upside-down system. We must turn it around. Tourism should be the biggest industry.\" Generally shy western capital sees the obvious opportunities in Cri- mea and Mr Bagrov has had Turkish, German, Italian, French, Spanish and even Aus- tralian delegations knocking on his door. But Mr Bagrov is an orthodox communist and he tells them all that land and buildings are not for sale. Western businesses can only buy shares. This reticence means that Crimea has concluded only one foreign deal: Gabrich, a Ger- man concern, last month began building a 150-room, five-star hotel in Gorzuf, near Yalta, which will be run as a joint venture. Politics could interfere with Crimean economic develop- ment in another way. Crimea depends on the Ukraine for 80 per cent of its electricity and for the water which irrigates the 380,000 hectares which yield one-half of Crimea's har- vest. If the pro-Russian cur- rent, now a minority view, gains popularity, Crimea might be subject to an economic blockade. Moreover, Mr Bagrov fears that a candidate such as Mr Viacheslev Chornovil, a former dissident and an advocate of radical reform, might win the Ukraine's forthcoming presi- dential elections. According to Mr Bagrov, in Crimea \"the ideas of Chornovil are not accepted. It is one thing to move towards the market, another to switch completely to capitalism.\" Mr Bagrov's opinion is cer- tainly shared by the denizens of Nizhna Arianda, a beauti- fully outfitted sanatorium near Yalta. A guest from Moscow, Vera Adamovna, urges: \"Don't write about it [the sanato- rium]. If you do, they [western- ers] will buy it and our people will not be able to afford to come here.\"",

   "text_content" : "Recession forces a downward revision of figures for the UK By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent A SURGE in sales in a unified Germany is expected to trigger a slight increase in overall western European new car sales this year, despite falling demand in several other key markets. According to DRI Europe, the automotive analysts, the strength of the German market has surprised even optimistic observers. DRI, which forecast earlier this year a 2.2 per cent decline in west European new car demand, says in its latest report that the market is now expected to expand by 0.5 per cent to 13,268,000 vehicles. The figures have been dis- torted by the strength of Ger- man demand and inclusion of east Germany in German new car registrations since the start of 1991. Excluding Germany, western European new car demand is forecast to fall by 9.3 per cent. Of 16 markets in western Europe only four - Germany, Austria, Greece and Portugal - are likely to enjoy higher demand levels this year. DRI forecasts that new car sales in Germany will jump by a third to 4.07m, from 3.04m in west Germany alone last year. Since its last forecast in May DRI has raised its estimate for German car sales by 510,000 and has increased its projec- tion for the share taken by east EUROPEAN CAR SALES FORECAST (000's) 1990 1991 1992 1993 1995 Western Europe total EC total Germany\" Italy France UK Spain Eastern bloc total 13,197 13,268 13,005 13,908 14,841 12,154 12,322 12,024 12,821 13,663 3,041 4,070 3,350 3,553 3,757 2,348 2,253 2,290 2,352 2,350 2,309 2,070 2,159 2,245 2,407 2,009 1,580 1,748 2,065 2,234 982 895 983 1,086 1,318 2,299 2,046 1,937 1,892 2,333 EUROPrAN CAR PRODUCTION PORECAST (o000') 1 ler n191 1992 1im le Westm Europe total 13,574 13,27 13,233 14,147 15,243 EC total 13,238 12,930 12,831 13,716 14,790 Germany\" 4,661 4.772 4,639 4,776 5,059 France 3,295 3,139 3,117 3,330 3,564 Italy 1.875 1,754 1.741 1.836 1,936 Spain 1,679 1,623 1,606 1,697 1,869 UK 1,296 1,216 1,306 1,561 1,756 Eastern bloc total 2,449 2.180 2,090 2,059 2,516 *1990 actual. 1991/95 forecast. \"From 1991 Germany total Includes East German states.

While the size of the increase in German sales has surprised the motor industry, it has also been forced to revise down- ward forecasts for the UK, in the face of a severe recession, and for France. UK new sales are projected to drop to 1.58m, a 31 per cent fall in two years and the lowest level since 1982. DRI suggests the picture will be reversed next year with the start of a recovery in France and the UK, where new car sales are expected to show a 10.6 per cent increase to 1.75m. Demand is likely to slip back in Germany from this year's inflated level, with an 18 per cent drop to 3.35m in the face of tighter economic conditions. While this will depress over- all western European demand by 2 per cent, the rest of the western European market, excluding Germany, is forecast to increase by 5 per cent. DRI estimates that the share of Japanese cars in the Euro- pean Community market will rise from 10 per cent in 1990 to 12.3 per cent in 1995, with the UK offering one of the biggest increases; from 11.7 per cent last year to 17.3 per cent in 1995.

   "text_content" : "By Hugo Dixon INTERNATIONAL telephone charges are likely to remain high for some time after national companies and minis- tries failed last week substan- tially to reform accounting rates. The rates are seen as responsible for keeping call charges considerably above costs. A meeting in Geneva of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Com- mittee (CCITT), grouping world companies and minis- tries, was described by one del- egate as a \"complete flop\". He added: \"Cartels have a hard time reforming themselves.\" The US delegation, which was leading the campaign for reform, drew some consolation from the fact that the thorny issue of accounting rates had been discussed. The CCITT has been under pressure to reform itself since last year when it was disclosed that international phone users were being overcharged by more than $10bn (Â£6bn) annu- ally on their calls. The accounting rate system, which is used to determine the allocation of revenue from international calls between phone companies, has been identified as one of the princi- pal causes of above-cost prices. Last week's meeting was called to examine ways of bringing rates into line with costs. The discussion centred on three US proposals: * To make accounting rates publicly available. This was rejected out of hand. Canada and Sweden, supported by Por- tugal and Spain, led the attack arguing that the rates should remain confidential. * That rates should be cost- based. This was opposed by South Korea, Chile and many Third World countries. The developing world is thought to receive several billion dollars annually under the system. Agreement, however, was reached on a diluted proposal that rates should be cost orien- tated. One participant argued that this did not go far beyond the status quo. * That rates should be applied to all countries in a non-dis- criminatory fashion. This was diluted to a proposal that rates should be applied on a consist- ent and equal basis. The CCITT could not agree to the wording of the proposal and will meet again to discuss the matter, probably in March."

   "text_content" : "David Gardner sees the EC peace conference begin with an exchange of vitriol between principal parties \"EUROPE Is on the edge of a disaster on the question of Yuslavia,\" judged Mr Douglas Hurdz t'e U for-\" en secretary, having Just seen the, EC's eace conference on Yugoslavia open in The Hague to an exchange of vitriol between Croat and Serb leid-: er. Lord Carrington, the fornmer UK for- eign secretary chosen to chair the, conference, remarked drily afterwards that he foresaw \"considerable difficul- ties ahead\". Indeed - but progress so far can Justly be said to be par or slightly better for a particularly treacherous course, despite the heat of Saturday's clashes. Mr Franjo TudJman, the rlght-wIng president of Croatia, which a g ith Slovenia declared itself Independent on June 25, accused Serbia and the Serb-dominated federal army of wag- ing a \"dirty, undeclared war\" against his republic which had claimed 2,200 dead and wounded. He suggested \"direct military intervention\" to pro- tect Croatia. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, won instant if ephemeral advantage by replying in English pol- ished into perfect sound-bites. The \"totalitarian and chauvinist regime in Croatia\" had set off the bloodbath by attacking its Serbian minority, which it would not be allowed to imprison inside a new and hostile state. Ser- bian paramilitaries in Croatia were defending themselves against \"the repetition of genocide\" carried out by the Nazi-installed Croatian republic during the Second World War. Yet it was only to be expected that the main combatants would use the \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t iobodu'iMlog c (left) aand rfo Tlij ma used the opening session to stake out their uncompromdslng positions opening - beamed back to Yugo- slavia - to stake out uncompromis- ing positions. It was equally predict- able that when the EC foreign ministers last week set Saturday as the date for the conference to start, there would be a great spasm of vio- lence in Croatia as each side sought last minute advantage on the ground. Lord Carrington's experience of these affairs, moreover, is now com- plemented by a new sureness of EC touch - which was lacking when the Community started its first interna- tional fireman's job 10 weeks ago. The EC's nerve was tested last week, when Germany appeared to have set off a campaign to recognise Croatian independence. Most of Bonn's partners see recognition as a final weapon, a sort of diplomatic nuclear bomb. But Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, has gone quiet on recognition. This is not least because his colleagues demonstrated that the Croats last week deliberately provoked combat with the federal army in order to \"internationalise\" the conflict. All this reflects growing knowledge of and engagement with the forces driving events in Yugoslavia. Much of the credit for this reflects on Mr Hans van den Broek, the tough-minded Dutch foreign minister and current president of the EC Council of Minis- ters. After being duped by Mr Milosevic on an earlier peace plan on August 4, he wielded the EC's few diplomatic weapons well enough to get all parties round Saturday's table. When Mr Milosevic insisted that Yugoslavia's internal boundaries were purely administrative, Mr van den Broek insisted the EC would never recognise \"any change unilaterally of internal or external borders\". And the Serbian leader signed a joint declara- tion agreeing. The Dutch minister's careful open- ing speech said the manipulation of nationalist sentiment to fill \"the emo- tional vacuum which accompanies the demise of communism\" was not acceptable. Europe would not allow itself to be sucked back into tribalism. Having accepted EC mediation, he told the Yugoslav leaders, \"you and we stand for a historical choice. Either we allow the violent past of Europe to return or we overcome this legacy and continue along the path towards unity in a Europe at peace with itself.\" Ringing words but they do not gain- say the intractability of dealing with a Croatia which sees its best chance as widening the civil war or with a Serbian leadership, using a thin fed- i eral cloak to hide its expansionism, whose grip on power is tightened by' the conflict. The conference is due to reconvene i on Thursday. Lord Carrington, Mr van den Broek underlined to his col-: leagues, will be the \"one, unanimous' voice\" of the EC, working from an office in the Dutch Foreign Ministry. He will have a secretariat of probably three senior EC diplomats, and divide the conference into working groups. These will seek maximum political: agreement before isolating those issues, such as frontiers and the' future of the federal army, which may require the binding arbitration to be: provided by five leading EC constitu- tional lawyers. But this is just structure. To coax along political agreement and accep- tance of arbitration, Lord Carrington will use the bilateral talks tactic which served him well at Lancaster House in 1979 when he tackled the Rhodesian issue, and which is the standard EC means of breaking log- jams. This means working with the factions on a one-to-one level, away from the spotlight which led to Satur- day's grandstanding. As this one-nation Tory patrician and former bear-hunting companion of Marshal Tito confronts the fissipa- rous tribes of Yugoslavia, one of his successors, Mr Hurd, recalled that \"Lord Carrington taught me the art of pessimistic diplomacy\". The deliber- ate creation of low expectations was his opening gambit in a peace process which is in for a very long haul.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem and Uonel Barber in Washington MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, said yesterday any link between Israel's request to the US for a $10bn loan guarantee and the planned Middle East peace con- ference could upset the region's peace process. The premier was thus step- ping up the rhetoric in the row with Washington over extra US financial assistance for Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel. President George Bush has taken an opposite view, asking Congress not to take up the issue of guarantees for $l0bn in Israeli borrowing until Janu ary, so as not to endanger deli- cately poised plans to launch Arab-Israeli peace talks next month. But the US administration, while deliberately picking a fight with Israel over its request, may still be prepared to offer some short-term help with the housing problems in Israel. Mr James Baker, US secre- tary of state, is to visit the Middle East this month after talks in the Soviet Union. His mission is to remove the final obstacles to a Middle East peace conference, and he may offer \"temporary\" aid to Jeru- salem to avoid \"linkage\" between the housing issue and participation in the peace talks. Mr Bush could have tied the request in red tape, as last year when Israeli sought $400m in loan guarantees. Instead, he went public with an unusual appeal to Congress to delay action for 120 days, until the conference was under way. Israel has protested loudly against \"linkage\", saying the loan guarantees to fund immi- gration are a separate issue. \"I said the act of linkage could endanger the nature of the peace process,\" Mr Shamir said on Israel Radio. \"Why? Because, at the moment, the Arabs suddenly get a gift like this which they don't expect. They will dance on the rooftops, the level of Young Palestinian men run from burning tyres during a weekend clash with Israeli troops, who broke up a march in support of Israeli-held prisoners, near Nablus on the West Bank their demands will go up and up, and this would not permit a peace process.\" In a speech to mark the Jew- ish New Year last night, Mr Shamir defied another US stric- ture, saying the momentum of increasing immigration went \"hand in hand\" with the momentum of Jewish settle- ment in the occupied territo- ries. Washington wants Israel to halt new building to settle Jews, which it calls an obstacle to peace. Israel went ahead at the weekend with the formal pre- sentation to the US govern- ment of its loan guarantee request, hours after Mr Bush had called on Congress to delay it. Despite this, and the strong protests at the weekend, Mr Shamir's government has avoided saying explicitly that it will try to win early approval of the package in Congress, in defiance of the president."

   "text_content" : "Israel's aim is deeper integration into the world economy, writes Hugh Carnegy T\" HE amount of foreign borrowing Israel must raise to fund the immi- gration of Soviet Jews is so great that US guarantees are needed to ensure it can be secured, according to Mr Jacob Frenkel, the newly ensconced governor of the Bank of Israel. Less than four weeks after exchanging the role of director of research at the International Monetary Fund for the central bank job, Prof Frenkel finds himself at the centre of the increasingly controversial debate over the guarantees. \"The world capital markets are so tight and the needs so vast that a small country like Israel coming to the market - even a good borrower like Israel - is going to have to pay rather stiff rates of inter- est. Also it is not clear that Israel may not face some avail- ability problems,\" he said. President George Bush has angered the Israeli government by asking the US Congress to delay until January consider- ation of its request for guaran- tees to back borrowing of $10bn (Â£5.9bn) for fear of upset- ting Middle East peace efforts. The government has already factored early approval of the guarantees into its 1992 budget plan. Prof Frenkel said the guarantees would affect Israel's need for a further $10bn from outside the US. \"With such loan guarantees Israel can go to the market place with an implicit vote of confidence in the economy, its prospects and in the economic strategy that it has, so we believe [granting the guaran- tees] is extremely important and we put it forward also as a means to assist in an extraordi- nary humanitarian challenge. \"Israel is not asking the US for loans. What Israel is asking is for loan guarantees which. . . will cost the Ameri- can tax payer very little or nothing at all.\" Prof Frenkel is due in Wash- ington later this week to argue the case - unless he is called back by Prime Minister Yit- zhak Shamir following Presi- dent Bush's forceful demand. He will inevitably face ques- tions about giving Israel addi- tional financial assistance when it refuses US calls to stop expansion of Jewish settle- ments in the occupied territo- ries. rof Frenkel was appointed, after all, by the most hardline gov- ernment Israel has ever had, which many believe puts the issue of keeping and settling the occupied territories above all others. But the governor says he cannot envisage diver- sion of resources away from \"the more important activities\" that immigration absorption demands. In Israel, the governor of the central bank is also chief eco- nomic adviser to the govern- ment. Prof Frenkel therefore has a potent role. to play in how the country copes with the influx of an estimated 1m Soviet Jews. Much of the debate focuses on the need for more rigorous reforms to cut down the role of the state. It is a debate which is also relevant to the loan guarantees because many economists argue that Israel has developed an over- dependence on foreign aid - mainly from the US - that has curbed the incentive for reforms. \"I think this point is valid as a matter of principle,\" says Prof Frenkel. \"But I think that by now everyone recognises that marginal changes in the economy will not do the job. Everyone recognises that we are now starting an era when one will need to see a funda- mental shaking of the tree.\" He cites recent moves to streamline and speed up priva- tisation as an example of this new mood. He also regards the recent cabinet debate over next year's budget in the same light, despite a deficit set at 6.2 per cent of gross national prod- uct. This is down on 1991 and all ministries, except defence, accepted cuts. Ministers agreed to legislate a staged elimina- tion of the deficit. They did not raise taxes. \"It was a very cou- rageous, determined political stance,\" says the governor. Prof Frenkel's overriding aim in his term of office is to oversee the deeper integration of Israel into the world econ- omy. But, again, does not the government's political stance stand in the way? Prof Frenkel chooses his words carefully. \"We are not in a vacuum, that's for sure. . . my job is to present to the government the economic consequences of various actions and to provide recom- mendations based upon these economic equations. At that stage the government takes this into account and puts it into the overall equation.\" Is he satisfied he will be lis- tened to? \"A1l I can. say,\" he laughs, \"is that I havw.been here three weeks and I haven't lost my voice yet.\"",

   "text_content" : "TURKISH officials yesterday welcomed a proposal by UN secretary-general Mr Javier Pdrez de Cu6llar to let Iraq make additional oil shipments so as to meet Turkey's transportation costs for the six-month export operation approved last month by the UN security council, reports John Murray Brown in Ankara. After the Gulf war, Turkey controls Iraq's only working oil outlet and would incur much of the cost of run- ning the 1,000-km pipeline from Kirkuk in northern Iraq to the Mediterranean terminal of Yumurtalik. The recommendation is part of the report on UN resolution 706, released at the weekend. It suggests Baghdad be allowed to raise up to $2.4bn (more than the $1.6bn approved in August to buy food and medicines), while making pay- ments to a war reparation fund and other costs covered under the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. An earlier draft failed to mention Turkey's costs. However, in \"response to requests,\" the UN chief recommends Iraqi oil shipments over and above the approved amount, to pay Turkey either in cash or kind. The UN says the actual costs still have to be negotiated. Turkey has pro- posed $264m. This comprises a charge of $1 a barrel for the proposed six months, compared with 77 cents levied on Iraqi oil before the crisis. Turkish officials \"will not agree to anything which does not reflect the real costs.\" They say the charge reflects increased start costs, personnel expenses and the $50m of debt servicing on the project's foreign loans during the period. The UN Security Council is due to start discussing the report today.",

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington THE US is ready to discuss the withdrawal of battlefield nuclear weapons from western Europe, Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said at the weekend. He said the US expected to discuss the issue with its Nato allies during a meeting of the alliance's nuclear planning group this month. Mr Cheney's comments sug- gest that the Bush administra- tion is considering further changes in its nuclear strategy in Europe following the col- lapse of the Warsaw Pact and the recent favourable develop- ments in the Soviet Union. Speaking on US television, Mr Cheney said: \"Both sides [US and Soviet Union] have short-range systems, artillery shells, short-range missiles with nuclear warheads on them which no longer have much validity in the new Euro- pean environment.\" Despite his offer on short-range nuclear weapons, Mr Cheney ruled out immedi- ate large-scale cuts in the US defence budget in the light of events in the Soviet Union. The present five-year plan would already bring down the size of US armed forces to its lowest level since before the Korean war. \"You cannot make those kinds of fundamental decisions about long-term US security requirements based on devel- opments day-to-day or even week-to-week in the Soviet Union,\" Mr Cheney said. The Pentagon's interest in opening talks on battlefield nuclear weapons stems partly from concerns about the prolif- eration of such weapons inside a Soviet Union which could be unstable over the next few years. More broadly, it points to general agreement that a more enlightened Soviet leadership which is prepared to cut defence spending and shrink the size of the Red Army opens the possibility of \"new thinking\" in US military strat- egy.

   "text_content" : "George Graham sees candidates' tentative start in Sioux City ITH five months to go before the first party primaries and caucuses of 1992, some Demo- crats were starting to worry about the shortage of candi- dates willing to take on Presi- dent George Bush. This weekend, however, there was a dress rehearsal, at least, for the campaign when contenders for the Democratic Party nomination gathered at Sioux City, on the Iowa bank of the Missouri river, to rally the faithful. Iowa voters are used to being courted long and hard by Dem- ocratic candidates, for the state's caucuses carry dispro- portionate weight as the first in the electoral calendar, so there was a feeling of relief that campaigning was under way at last. \"We have, finally, candidates who are willing to take on George Bush. This is the kick- off of the 1992 campaign,\" pro- claimed Mr John Roehrick, chairman of the Iowa Demo- cratic Party. He may have spoken too soon. As yet, only two candi- dates have formally declared that they are seeking the presi- dential nomination: ex-Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachu- setts, who presents himself as the best economist in the Dem- ocratic party, and Mr Larry Agran, who describes himself as one of the three Democrats in staunchly Republican Orange County, California, His blend of environmentalism and defence cuts would make him a convincing Green candidate in Europe. Sioux City attracted these candidates, both widely viewed as outsiders, but also drew two probable con- tenders who may come to sym- bolise the Democratic debate over how to shake off the party's long losing streak. Senator Tom Harkin, on his home turf in Iowa, embodies a wide range of traditional Dem- ocratic constituencies, from labour unions to civil rights organisations. He calls for deep cuts in the overseas military The White House remains concerned about the slow pace of economic recovery in the US, before the presiden- tial election next year, Mr John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, said yesterday, Lionel Barber reports from Washington. Mr Sununu avoided earlier administration calls for lower interest rates to spur economic activity but he gently nudged Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in that direction. Mr Sununu said on television: \"We would like a stronger recovery. . . I think he understands that we lean a little further towards the loosening of interest rates than he has.\" presence in favour of massive infrastructure projects. His message is that the Dem- ocrats have lost the last three presidential elections through having abandoned their tradi- tional values and tried to be more like the Republicans. On the other side of the party is Mr Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the longest-serving governor in the US but only 45, who argues that the Democrats have to overhaul their message to attract the people who have not voted for them in the past. Mr Clinton, whose goofy grin masks a keen grasp of policy detail, recognises the wide- spread antipathy to federal government intervention of the kind favoured by Mr Harkin. \"One of the things the Demo- crats are going to have to do to be credible in this election is to show that we can reform the government we created,\" he said. In Iowa this weekend, these differences were papered over. However, as more candi- dates, such as Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska or Gover- nor Douglas Wilder of Virginia, enter the race in weeks to come, the cleavage could widen as the Democrats seek a win- ning message against an incumbent president who seems invincible.",

The decision reverses one of the main promises of the New Democratic party before the election which brought it to power a year ago, but reflects its growing sensitivity to criti- cism of its economic policies. Mr Bob Rae, premier, said the scheme would \"cost too much money and too many jobs.\" The government would look for other ways to cut driv- ers' premiums and to expand accident victims right to sue. The province's insurance industry, dominated by US and British companies, lobbied strongly against the scheme. * More than 100,000 Canadian federal civil servants were to go on strike at midnight last night in protest against gov- ernment wage plans.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawlth in Johannesburg THE South African government has announced a package of investment incen- tives which are likely to result in several big capital projects being given the go-ahead. The incentives, aimed at encouraging exports of more highly refined mineral prod- ucts, offer accelerated tax write-offs for capital expendi- ture. They will reduce start-up costs of large projects and pro- vide assistance in early years. The announcement will probably lead to the go-ahead for the R3bn (Â£652m) Columbus stainless steel project, a joint venture between Highveld Steel and Samancor, respec- tively controlled by Anglo American and Gencor, the country's two largest mining houses. The plant's initial capacity would be 300,000 tonnes a year, rising to 400,000. Mr Dawie de Villiers, minis- ter of economic affairs and co- ordination, said the short-term measures had a maximum qualifying period of two years. The main benefit allows depreciation of the cost of machinery and plant from the year when the expenses were Incurred, rather than when production started. The exist- ing rate of 2 per cent over five years still applies. Other benefts include depre- ciation of the annual allowance of 5 per cent of the constru- tion costs of qualiing build- ings, and the d-duction of pre- production interest on qualiy- ing assets, both in the year expenses are incurred. To quality a project must be internationally competitive and add at least 20 per cent value to the base mineral or intermediate project processed, with at least 60 per cent of the value of the intermedi- ate or final product being exported. Another possible project whose go-ahead depends on incentives such as those announced is a plan by Alusaf, the aluminium producer, to build a R3.5bn aluminium smelter.",

   "text_content" : "MANY civilians have been killed or wounded in three days of fighting in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, Mogadishu radio said yesterday, but order was being restored, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The radio blamed the vio- lence on \"irresponsible ele- ments\" and denied there had been fighting between rival groups in the United Somali Congress (USC) which controls Mogadishu. Diplomats and aid workers in Nairobi had reported heavy fighting and said limited hospital facilities there were trying to cope with large numbers of casualties. Aid workers flying out of the capital reported an apparent conflict between the USC leader, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, recently appointed interim president of Somalia, and his army chief, General Mohamed Farah Aldeed. Colonel Umar Hashi Adan, regional commander of the Mogadishu area, called for a ceasefire and told local elders and community leaders to cooperate in restoring calm. The weekend radio broadcast referred to a \"security crisis\" in Mogadishu in which many innocent people had been killed or wounded and houses and other property destroyed. It said the security forces would now take immediate action to enforce a ceasefire."

   "text_content" : "POLAND'S communist-dominated parliament decided at the weekend to delay voting on a request by the Solidarity govern- ment for temporary special powers to issue economic decrees with the force of law, Reuter reports from Warsaw. Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, prime minister, made the request on Friday to try to overcome a logjam holding up reform legislation and a stalemate in government efforts to introduce budget spend- ing cuts in the face of a recession. The vote will be postponed for at least a week while a commis- sion considers the request. Earlier the bill narrowly survived a proposal by a peasants' hardline group in the lower house, or Sejm, to have it thrown out altogether. The planned reduction in budget spending has been fiercely criticised by opposition deputies in the Sejm. During the debate on the cuts last week, an ex-communist group tried to unseat the government ahead of a parliamentary poll in October. Optimism over W German orders Manufacturing orders in west Germany slipped 0.5 per cent in July from the previous month, despite a 3.5 per cent rise in foreign orders, David Goodhart writes from Bonn. The Economics Ministry welcomed the increase in foreign orders and suggested west German industry might be recovering its old exporting strength. The ordefigure for June and July is 2.5 per cent above the April and May figure and 4.4 per cent above the same two months of last year.

Senators who have threatened to kill the accord said the cold war was finished and it was time forces withdrew from the former US colony. Communist rebels, fighting against the US presence for the past 22 years, offered a truce if the senators rejected the treaty. The anti-bases faction in the 23-member Senate gained ground yesterday, picking up a ninth senator to sign a joint resolution calling the treaty a \"one-sided, 'unequal agreement\" and urging its rejection.

   "text_content" : "By David Houmsgo in New Delhi INDIAN industry called yesterday on the government to allow companies to improve efficiency by speeding up cuts in labour forces. Mr V.L. Dutt, newly elected chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said the government should amend labour laws so that industry could retrench about 5 per cent of its labour force annually \"without going through the proper legal and labour proce- dures\". FICCI is one of two main employer associations in the country. The World Bank has identi- fled overmanning in industry as one of the most serious obstacles to greater competi- tiveness; a recent bank report said the public sector had a surplus workforce of 250,000 to 300,000 people. The government - which announced a new industrial deregulation policy two months ago - is hesitant to draw up an \"exit\" policy for industry, fearing it could pro- voke union anger. Although the unions' response to the industrial liberalisation mea- sures has so far been muted, officials fear rising inflation and redundancies could trigger a backlash. According to figures released yesterday, the year-on-year inflation rate - as measured by the wholesale price index - rose to 15.2 per cent in the week ending August 24, more than double the rate of the pre- vious year. Reflecting the.new competi- tive pressures that industry feels are being imposed on it, Mr Dutt said companies should have freedom to close units when they were non-profitable. The government does not want to move in this direction until a welfare safety net has been established for employ- ees. Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said in his budget that the government proposed establishing a fund to finance early retirement, to which industry would be asked to contribute. Mr Dutt also said the govern- ment should either privatise the nationalised banks or open the banking system to the pri- vate sector. Bank employee associations are strongly resisting such pri- vatisation.",

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atdna MR PETER BROOKE, North- ern Ireland secretary, has embarked on the laborious task of reviving talks on the province's political future by calling for consultations with local political leaders. In spite of the proximity of the general election and Union- ist preconditions which have, if anything, hardened over the summer, Mr Brooke believes a fresh round of \"talks about talks\" would be constructive. He will seek the views of the government of the Irish Repub- lic at a meeting of the Ango- Irish Conference in Belfast this week. Meetings with Unionists and the nationalist Social Demo- cratic and Labour party are expected to be arranged soon afterwards. In July the first round-table talks for 15 years between lead- ers of nationalist and Unionist parties on the governance of the province ended without conclusion when a pre-ar- ranged 10-week gap in Anglo- Irish conference meetings expired. The setback undermined hopes that a solution to Northern Ireland's decades of political intransigence could be found at the negotiating table. Mr Brooke had spent 14 months carefully preparing the rules for those meetings. Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Brooke emphasised the com- munity pressure for negotia- tions to restart and the lack of recrimination following July's setback. He would seek discus- sions with the political leaders in a \"low-key and relaxed way\". Unionists have not ruled out participating in fresh talks. But the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, has increased demands over the 1985 Anglo-Irish agree- ment, under which the regular inter-governmental conference meetings are held. Most Union- ist MPs argue its workings have to be suspended for far longer than 10 weeks, if not indefinitelyp Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, set Northern Ireland's prob- lems in a European context at the weekend. He said the Anglo-Irish Agreement was, like Lenin's tomb, an obscene relic of less enlight- ened times. Given past form it is unlikely much progress could be made, even if the general election were delayed until summer. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strang- ford, said Mr Brooke was \"unwise\" to start talks so close to an election. \"Everyone will be looking over their shoulders now,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Cane A MEETING of Bank of Credit and Commerce International depositors and staff last night heard angry demands for Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, gover- nor of the Bank of England, to apologise for or retract sugges- tions that a \"criminal culture\" had existed within the bank. The meeting at Brent Town Hall in north-west London was set up to hear the results of a fact-finding tour of Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong led by Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who heads the paliamentary cam- paign to help BCCI depositors. Mr Qaiser Malik of the staff and depositors' co-ordinating group said that all the bank's former employees had been smeared by Mr Leigh-Pemb- erton's suggestion. He knew of some who had received between 90 and 100 rejection letters from prospective new employers because of what he described as the BCCI taint. Organisers of the co-ordinat- ing committee are to see Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign sec- retary, today. They will urge him to support a relaunch of the bank, and ask for Mr John Major to travel to Abu Dhabi to repair relations. After last night's meeting a number of anxious investors who had stayed on to question members of the committee heard Mr Ahmed Shahzad, a Brent councillor who had helped set up the meeting, report the detaining of a num- ber of senior BCCI officidals in Abu Dhabi. Earlier on, members of the fact-finding group spoke of the \"deep hurt\" felt by the Abu Dhabi people. Banking officials in Abu Dhabi were determined to clear up the affair but it was essential they felt confident of the intentions of the British government. Mr Dominic Teuma, of the BCCI Staff Distress Group, told the meeting \"We all feel it was a very hasty action taken by the Bank of England - incor- rect action, inappropriate action - and we want to see justice done.\" The chairman of a group of BCCI investors. in Gibralter said that more than 5,000 Brit- ons who had lost EÂ£9m in the local branch had been ignored by the depositors' protection scheme, which offered British depositors a Â£5,000 interim cash payout.",

   "text_content" : "vy Edward Dlaft FURTHER evidence that British business leaders believe the worst of the sreoasion Is ' over is published today in the lastest Institute of Directort' bi-monthly survey.. The survey suggests buti- ness confidence is higher than. at any time in the past two years, but for a short-ilved surge after the Gulf war. Business is still tough, how. ever. Nearly half of respon- dents say business volume is down compared with six . months ago, and less than a a quarter say volumes are rising. Mr Peter Morgan, loD direm- tor-general, said: \"Business performance is still flat for many companies but directors, the decision makers, can see the blanket of recession is. beginning to lift.\" The same number of direc- tors are more optimistic as are less optimistic about the pros- pects for the economy, an improvement on the last sur- vey. The proportion of respon- dents more optimistic about prospects for their own com- pany is also higher. \"Inflation is being defeated. Interest rates are coming down and the economy can be expec- ted to show signs of recovery in the final quarter of this year,\" Mr Morgan said. Out oft e gloom: \"directore. can uee the of recemion sys IFerf Morgan Yet there is little tangible evidence that a recovery in spending is under way. Mr Morgan hopes 10 per cent inter- est rates will be a psychologi- cal point at which consumer spending resumes, demand increases, and the recovery begins. The loD said the con- tinued fall in inflation would justify another half-point cut in interest rates next month. The survey is based on a random telephone poll of 320 directors in the first two weeks of August. It asks questions similar to those in the quar- terly Confederation of British industry Industrial Trends Sur- vey, but is smaller and less systematic. Yet it does offer some clues about the possible nature of the recovery. Busi- nesses are significantly more optimistic in the north of England than in the Midlands or the south. In the north, 70 per cent of respondents claim their company is performing either very well or fairly well, against 60 per cent in the UK as a whole. The survey also suggests the service sector may lead the recovery just as it led the econ- omy into recession.

SALES of new commercial vehicles fell by 29.2 per cent in August compared with a year earlier to 28,946, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The decline was led by a fur- ther steep drop in truck demand. Sales in the first eight months at 151,107 were 30.3 per cent lower than in the corre- sponding period a year ago. Mr David Gill, truck market- ing and sales managing direc- tor for Leyland DAS, the UK subsidiary of DAS of the Netherlands, said yesterday the rate of decline and the depth of the recession in the UK commercial vehicles mar- ket was unprecedented since the Second World War. He said the present recession was biting much deeper than the last recession - in the early 1980s. He forecast that truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) would fall as low as 32,000 this year, a drop of a third from the 48,000 achieved last year and less than half the 1989 sales level of. 69,000. There was no sign of any respite in August as truck sales fell by 35.7 per cent to 3,819. In the first eight months truck sales have plunged by 37.8 per cent to 21,944. Sales were 55.6 per cent lower than in the same period two years ago. Mr Gill said it was \"highly unlikely\" that truck registra- tions would show any signifi- cant recovery before the end of the year. He did not expect market conditions to worsen further in the final months of the year, however, and forecast that sales could begin to recover to a level of 37,000-43,000 in 1992. In the past three months Leyland DAS had experienced a \"modest\" increase in new orders, and he said some truck rental companies had started ordering again for the first time for two years. In addition a substantial part of the UK truck fleet was more than three years old and would need replacing soon. * DAS is closing its interna- tional marketing and sales office in Salford, near Man- chester with the loss of about 115 jobs. The office, which was estab- lished only two years ago, is being transferred to the com- pany's Netherlands headquar- ters in Eindhoven, where about 80 jobs will be created. The move is part of DAF's drive to cut costs and stream- line its organisation in the face of heavy losses."

   "text_content" : "By Paul Cheerlight, Midlands Correspondent CENTRO, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority's operating arm, which stands to lose more than Â£2.5m in the BCCI ddbdcle, is to restrict its cash balances to Â£500,000. Any funds above Â£500,000 will be managed for Centro by Coventry City Council, the lead council on the authority. That is one of a series of steps taken at Centro after the Bank of England closed BCCI on July 5. Only 4'/% hours before the closure Centro deposited Â£lm with BCCL This deposit was one of three total- ling Â£2,550,361.29 which were frozen by the action of the Bank of England. The immedi- ate reaction of Mr Bob Tarr, Centro director-general, was to obtain reports from Mr Phil Evans, director of finance, and from Mr Brian Moore, internal audit manager. Mr Tarr later asked KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the external auditor, to look at Centro's procedures for depos- iting funds not needed for immediate use. The results of these inquiries have been published with an umbrella report by Mr Tarr as background documents for a meeting of the authority's pol- icy, resources and external relations committee. They do not show any evi- dence of impropriety in Centre. But they do throw a spotlight on the money management of a typical small authority. Peat Marwick found that Centro's internal guidelines on where its officers could deposit money were \"too wide\" and observed that \"there was no investment strategy which clarified the objectives in terms of the level of risk per- mitted in depositing surplus monies\". For Centro, as for all public authorities under pressure to maximise income, the deposit of surplus cash represented a significant extra source of income. Such investments raised Â£.2m for Centro in the 1990-91 financial year. If Centro had a surplus of less than S.5m, it would place it with Midland Bank. If it had more, it would. place it with other institutions through a broker. Those institutions, according to the internal guidelines, were \"very safe bodies.\" Like other authorities, Centro drew comfort from the fact that BCCI was on the Bank of England list of licensed deposit-takers, and hence fitted into the internal guidelines. Mr Evans had the right of veto over where deposits could be placed and received weekly reports on what was happening to short-term deposits. He had used the veto to stop deposits with Liverpool City Council and Lambeth Borough Council in London. But, Mr Tarr says in his report, no one in Centro picked up \"doubts and rumours\" about BCCL The day on which BCCI was closed, Centro had Â£7.3m on deposit at seven financial insti- tutions. Decisions on placing its funds depended on what was on offer from London money-brokers. It could have placed all its surplus at Midland Bank for onward investment in the money market at no risk. But on Friday July 12, according to the Moore report, Midland's 3-day rate for a Elm deposit was 10.625 per cent. The best rate available from a broker was 11 per cent. The difference in return proj- ected over one year would be Â£3.75m. The difference in rates encapsulates the dilemma of balancing risk against reward that Peat Marwick thought Centro had not fully clarified. Ltters, Page 15",

   "text_content" : "By Vanessa Houlder, Property Correspondent COMMERCIAL property rents are falling by a record 10 per cent a year, although the decline may now be over, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. In the three months to August the decline in rents gathered pace, reaching 4.5 per cent. This reflects the recession and the surplus of commercial property erected in the building boom of the past few years. Hillier Parker said, how- ever, that rents of shops and City of London offices appeared to be close to their turning points. By far the largest decline has been in the office sector, which has a particularly large oversupply of space. Office rents fell 7.9 per cent in the past quarter and 18.8 per cent in the year to August. The largest falls in rents have been registered in the central London office market, which has a vacancy rate of 18 per cent. The City fringe was the worst-performing market,. with a fall of 32 per cent. The best-performing sector was shops, where rents fell 2.1 per cent over the year and 1.4 per cent over the quarter.

   "text_content" : "By Rolaind Rudd THE Post Office is considering .joining the joint venture between five state-owrned postal administrations and TNT, the Australian transport group, to supply a worldwide express service. When the deal was announced in July, analysts assumed that the UK Post Office had been barred by the government from joining the venture. However Sir Bryan Nichol- son, Post Office chairman, yes- terday told the Financial Times that he thought it could be in the interests of his organ- isation to join if it were shown that the venture was sinan- cially practical and would improve the express services available. \"There is no doubt that there is a very strong case for having closer links with other national post offices to provide a high quality of service to individual customers,\" he added. \"There is also no doubt that TNT has an effective world- wide network which the other post offices wanted access to.\" The new venture will com- bine the post offices' interna- tional express operations with those of TNT Express World- wide, a subsidiary of TNT. Sir Bryan said that since the UK Post Office was a national public-sector body it would have to justify to the govern- ment a decision to join the ven- ture. He added that be could see no reason why ministers would object to a recommendation to join the venture. Five post offices from Ger- many, France, the' Nether- lands, Sweden and Canada have formed a new group, GD Net, to take a 50 per cent stake in the venture. The other 50 per cent will be held by TNT. * GD Net's structure allows for the participation of other postal administrations. The new company will be autono- mous and managed indepen- dently of both shareholders. Sir Bryan has recently had a series of meetings with the chairman of the five post offices involved in the new organisation, which will have about 20 per cent of the inter- national express market. It will start operations by the end of the year and should be profitable by 199293, the first full financial year, according to the partners. The UK Post Office will be able to join the group after operations have started if it has satisfied itself that the ven- ture will be profitable.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy BRITISH Sky Broadcasting is on target to have more than 2m satellite dishes receiving its programmes by the end of this year, following a strong perfor- mance last month. According to the FT Satellite Monitor, 62,000 dishes were installed in August in spite of the recession and the fact that television equipment sales are traditionally slow in summer. The monitor's August figure, based on interviews with more than 5,000 adults, matches BSkyB's internal sales figures. More than 180,000 satellite dishes have been installed since June, giving a total of 1.74m, according to the moni- tor. This does not include those who watch satellite channels on cable TV networks. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, which produces the FT monitor, said 2.2m dishes by the end of December was a difficult but possible target. \"If BSkyB and the retail trade promote as heavily as might be expected, then this could happen - and a figure of 2m by Christmas seems almost certain.\" BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a sig- nificant stake, will launch a marketing campaign this week. Intentions to install satellite dishes remain low, and only 198,000 householders say they will definitely installone. The main decline came among 45-to-65-year-olds, with under-45s showing a small increase in intentions to install. Satellite television is particularly strong in homes with children. Of the 7m such homes in Britain 733,000 - 10.5 per cent - have dishes. Scotland and the north of England have emerged as the strongest regions for satellite television. In Scotland 22 per cent of householders have a dish or say they will probably install one. In the north of England the percentage is 18.5.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent TOP executives at London Transport have come out in open rebellion against the gov- ernment's plans for the privati- sation and deregulation of Lon- don's buses. They are furious over the governinment's decision to strip London Transport of all responsibility for the capital's bus services and hand it to a new body called the London Bus Executive. Mr Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman, has said in an internal memorandum to all LT staff: \"The board of Lon- don Transport and I have been surprised and disappointed by this decision. \"I would like you all to know that I believe it is not in the best interests of passengers, or of London, to discard LT's years of experience and know- ledge and to start again. \"It is my view that the gov- ernment has chosen the most expensive and least effective option, and I have told them so.\" The government's plans for the deregulation of London's buses were first set out in a consultation paperlast March. The paper poposed thatILo- don =a ' bus openation should be privatied and that any other operators should be allowed to compete against them. The paper also proposed that a central body should remain to organise unprofitable but socially necessary services, publish route maps and time. tables, look after bus stops and administer the Travelcard through-ticket scheme. Although many of London Transport's employees and managers are opposed to dere- gulation, LT's executives, who are appointed by the govern- ment, had until recently sup- ported it. Their support rested, how- ever, on the assumption that London Transport would retain an overall responsibility for bus matters. Their rebellion follows July's publication of the govern- ment's detailed plans for de- regulation, proposing that the central functions should go to the government-funded Lon- don Bus Executive. - Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, aid pri- vate operators did not want London Transport to, have this role because It had ompeting transport functions through Its responsibility for the Under- -ound system. London Transport, however, believes the creation of a sepa- rate body will throw away its long experience in bus trans- port and lead to the breakdown of coordinated travel informa- tion services in the capital It plans to lobby for changes in the proposals when, in the event of a Conservative victory at the next election, they are presented for legisla- tion early in the next parlia- ment. It says that, if the govern- ment's proposals go through in their present form, one conse- quence could be that 18,000 bus stops in the capital would have to be replaced, because London Transport holds the copyright to the familiar logo which appears on them.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans REPRESENTATIVES of water- company customers have given a mixed response to a series of options for calculating bills. Some favour metering and oth- ers a system of banded charges based on type of household. Three main charging options - metering, property banding and a flat-rate licence fee - were put forward in a consulta- tion document published last November by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the industry's economic regulator. Responses from Ofwat's 10 independent customer-service committees covering England and Wales, published today, show five favouring metering. The five are Anglia, Wessex, Wales, Southern and Thames. Four (Central, North West, Yorkshire and South West) chose some form of banding, while Northumbria offered qualified support for banding and came out firmly against both general metering and the flat-rate licence fee. There is general support among the responses for a con- sumer-friendly meter option in areas where compulsory meter- ing is not introduced, with cus- tomers being allowed easy pay- ment facilities. There is opposition to high standing charges, which reduce the incentive to save water and the customer's ability to control the size of the bill. The present method of charging for domestic water and sewerage services, basedd on a standing charge and a property's rateable value, will cease to be legal at the end of the decade, following the aboli- tion of domestic rates. An alternative method is therefore needed. The Water Act lays down the structure of the industry, which was privatised nearly two years ago. It leaves charg- ing policy to the individual companies under the supervi- sion of Ofwat. Mr Ian Byatt, director- general of Ofwat, said: \"Cus- tomer-service committees have played a vital role in promo- ting public debate in their regions about future methods of charging for water. \"There is no single or easy answer to the question of what should replace rateable-value- based charging . . . I will attach considerable weight to the views of the committees in drawing up a strategy to guide water companies in reaching their decisions about future methods of charging.\" Ofwat proposes to publish its guidelines later this year.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Tomkins explains why a leading manufacturer has ousted its chief executive B REL, DBLtain's biggest trainmnakeri I n trou- ble. There can be no doubt of that after last week's ousting of its chief executive and the discovery of further serious defects in the compa- ny's most important product. But the full explanation for Brel's problemslies less in the events of the past few days or weeks than in the period lead- ing up to the company's priva- tisation in April 1989. Although Brpl was part of British Rail at the time it was sold, and was therefore BR's biggest supplier of rolling stock, a policy of making it compete with the private sec- tor for BR orders had been in place for several years. It was therefore against tough competition that, in November 1987, it landed the Â£200m contract to build a new type of express train - the class 158 - which was to form the backbone of BR's Regional Railways fleet. Brel won the order by offer- ing quick delivery of a product which represented a technolog- ical leap forward in train tech- nology. Instead of evolving out of earlier models, the design for the class 158 started on a blank sheet of paper. Innovations proliferated. Passengers were to be cosseted with microprocessor-controlled air conditioning; turbocharged diesel engines under each car- riage promised fast accelera- tion and high speeds; and, most significantly, the train bodies were to comprise a sin- gle, lightweight aluminium shell instead of the traditional steel body on a steel chassis. As Brel got to work on the order, preparations for privati- sation were moving ahead. In April 1989 the company was sold to a management- employee buy-out team backed by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Trafalgar House, the UK construction group. A significant hurdle had to be cleared before the sale was agreed. It now emerges that ABB and Trafalgar House were acutely concerned that Brel had overreached itself with the delivery schedule it had prom- ised for the class 158. Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar House's representative director on Brel's main board, com- pares Brel's new product with a revolutionary car, built from Slow train cominr: rl class 165 which, lke the 158, Is running several months behind schedule a new material, with sophisti- cated new electronic controls, a new engine and a new drive train. \"You would not put the first vehicle you produced in a showroom and expect it to be picked up by Joe Public and driven away without any faults emerging,\" he says. \"But that is what the con- tractual arrangement was between Brel and BR for the class 158. Twenty months into the contract, the vehicles were due to start rolling off the pro- duction line at the rate of five a week with no allowance for prototype testing whatsoever.\" So great were the concerns of ABB and Trafalgar House that they insisted on re- negotiating the agreement to buy Brel from BR in an attempt to build in guarantees against claims arising from the class 158 contract. Once the sale was concluded, they stood back. Although each now owned 40 per cent of Brel's shares, compared with the 20 per cent held by man- agement and employees, the deal had been done on the basis that the buy-out would leave the incumbent manage- ment in place. Within months, however, the class 158 contract had started to go wrong. The first train was due to be handed over to BR in October 1989. Instead, the schedule was thrown back six months after the discovery of serious structural weak- nesses in the aluminium body- shell. The problems multiplied as more faults were discovered. Delivery schedules slipped fur- ther and BR fumed as its time- tables were thrown into chaos. W hen the trains even- tually started to enter service a year late, they developed a series of teething troubles. By early this year it was becoming clear that Brel was plunging into losses after reporting a pre-tax profit of Â£22.4m for the year to Septem- ber 1990. In June it emerged that the discovery of another structural defect in the class 158 meant the entire fleet would have to be returned for more modifica- tions under warranty. But the majority sharehold- ers' patience seems to have snapped when delivery sched- ules started to slip on another crucial contract - the produc- tion of the class 165 and class 465 Networker trains which are to form the backbone of BR's Network SouthEast fleet in the next few years. The Networker, to some extent a derivative of the class 158, is another revolutionary aluminium-bodied train intended to provide an upward leap in quality of services for passengers on Network South- East. Problems on the scale of those which have afflicted the class 158 could cause a public outcry so serious as to have political consequences, and Brel's reputation as a train- maker would be destroyed. No longer content to be pas- sive investors amid this deep- ening crisis, ABB and Trafal- gar House have now asserted control over the company. Mr Peter Holdstock, the Brel chief executive who led the buy-out, has been replaced by Mr Bo Sodersten, a Swede nominated by ABB, and other management changes are imminent. Still to be resolved, mean- while, is the question of who is going to pay for the class 158 fiasco. The defective trains have been mended at Brel's expense, but Regional Rail- ways says it has incurred addi- tional costs of Â£20m in revenue losses and the extra cost of keeping older, inefficient trains in service. The majority shareholders are naturally reluctant to accept responsibility for what they see as mistakes made when Brel was still owned by BR. Further, says Mr Gormly, the renegotiated agreement for the purchase of Brel from BR reflected the shareholders' con- cerns about the risks presented by the class 158 contract. He said: \"The agreement sets out arrangements for the par- ties to see how the costs have arisen and how they are to be shared between the parties. \"There are going to be some interesting discussions between ourselves and British Rail about the commercial settlement of these issues.\"",

   "text_content" : "By David Owen THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS yesterday outlined plans to set up a \"comprehensive tier\" of English community and neigh- bourhood councils with \"greatly extended\" powers as part of its local government policy. The party's proposals are designed to engineer a decen- tralisation of power at the local level. Mr David Bellotti MP said: \"We would decentralise power to the level closest to the people wherever possible.\" Under the recommendations poll tax would be replaced by a local income tax, levied at a rate set by the council and col- lected via the Inland Revenue PAYE and other income tax systems. The uniform business rate would in turn be abolished in favour of a system of site value rating, set by each coun- cil and related to the value of the land as opposed to the buildings on it. The party claimed that this would promote the efficient use of land and free control of significant chunks of council income from \"Whitehall's grip.\" Equalisation of council income would be taken away from central government con- trol and exercised collectively by local councils. A string of regional authori- ties would be established throughout England to exer- cise power that the party would devolve from central government. Priority would be given to the creation of a Greater London regional authority. All related elections would be held by proiprioa repre- sentation ussingthe single transferable vote syste. The party said that it envis- aged a six-year timetable of reform. * The Labour-affiliated Fabian Society has advocated the widespread introduction of customer contracts for council services while. highlighting \"the dramatic centrallsation of power that has taken 'place under the Tories.\" In a pamphlet on improving public services it proposed that council services be devolved to neighbourhood offices to pro- vide a \"one-stop\" arrangement where residents could \"pay the poll tax, deal with a housing repair or complain about a noisy neighbour.\"",

Known as especially diligent towards local needs since his election (with the princely majority of 57 votes) as Liberal MP for Berwick in 1973, Mr Beith will be resuming his annual pilgrimage around 120 Northumberland villages in a mobile office as soon as the conference ends. \"I hope I have not changed the level of commitment I have to local constituency needs,\" he says. In several respects, notably its espousal of free trade and advocacy of a strengthened competition policy, the new paper represents a reiteration of traditional Liberal economic philosophies. It also focuses on a number of the former New- castle upon Tyne University lecturer's pet concerns. Into this category would fall its emphasis on the need for openness in economic decision- making and for increased investment in education and vocational training. On Europe, it proposes a rapid and timetabled move towards economic and mone- tary union, incorporating an independent central bank. It advocates a national savings target, met with the help of fiscal adjustments, in a bid to ensure that investment levels are maintained. The party has acquired a notoriety in political circles for publicly admitting that it would put a penny on income tax if need be to finance its education proposals. far from committing electoral suicide, Mr Beith believes that the pledge will end up winning the party support among \"the thinking electorate\". He explains: \"We believe that there is a substantial sec- tion of the British electorate which realises that certain things have to be done and we are not shy about saying so.\" He is keen \"that the party does not become one that is soft on taxation or thinks that high taxation is a good thing.\" In answer to the assertion that independent central banks and savings targets will not cut much ice on the average door- step in Batley or Bideford, Mr Beith suggests that the impor- tent thing is to be recognised as having serious and well. thought-out economic policies. The party can tell voters that \"the interest rates we have had would not have been necessary if the disciplines we suggest had been in place,\" he says. These disciplines would act as \"protection against the sort of mortgage misery we have experienced\".",

   "text_content" : "By AlMson Sm MR PADDY ASHDOWN, leader of the Liberal.Demcrats, yea- ted diimed his party was the onl' one ca16 be a chalo lenging both Labour and the Tories. He also, attacked Labour for havingleft \"a huge vacuum\" inBritish politics and asbein incapable of beating the Tories. At the start of the party's conference, Mr Ashdown said Labour had missed its opportu- nity to provide a real alterna- tive to the Conservatives and was paying the price. Its surge in the opinion polls had been checked, and he believed Labour could not win. He cited in support of this a letter he had received from Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Bir- mingham Perry Bar. Mr Rooerp, who is a junior social security spokesman and a cam- paigner for electoral reform, wrote to Mr Ashdown to try to secure his support for Labour in seati where Liberal Demo- crat candidates had no chance of winning. The Liberal Democrats have been at pains to play up their ability to provide an alterna- tive attractive to voters throughout the UK, emphasis- ing their consistent perfor- mance in recent byelections. While the Tories lost their deposit at Liverpool Walton, and Labour lost its deposit at Eastbourne, the Liberal Demo- crate came second to Labour in Walton and took Eastbourne from the Tories. Mr Des Wilson, the party's camnpaigns manager, said the Liberal Democrats were ready to fight an election on Novem- ber 7. The third prty's prob- lem had always been that it was seen as a wasted vote. \"The whole game changes if Labour is perceived as a wasted vote,\" he said. The Lib- eral Democrats were on course to reach its target of Â£1.25m for the election fund. The party estimates that some 2,000 delegates will attend the conference, which an upbeat Mr Ashdown insisted would not be spent talking about a hung parlia- ment. He said the party would use the time to spell out and sharpen its message on educa- tion, the economy, environ- mental policies and Europe. But, facing the inevitable question about what he would do if the Liberal Democrats held the balance of power, he signalled that the party would not acquiesce in keeping a minority government in power to avoid the uncertainty that would be created by two elec- tions in quick succession. Mr Ashdown rejected the idea that, without a deal. his party might be disadvantaged because its stance was mseen a the cause of the second elec- tion. He warned that if the Conservatives or Labour sought \"to grab power and have a period of instability, the electorate will know what to make of that\".",

   "text_content" : "Alison Smith explains how the party's tactics are aimed at maximising election gains THE sophistication of Liberal Democrat by-election tactics has long been a source of pride to the party and annoyance to its opponents. It was not a feature of the 1987 election campaign, how- ever, as the confusion of hav- ing two differing Alliance lead- ers blunted the party's message. This time the party is determined to make its resources and expertise count. At the heart of the party's campaign plan is the tactic of \"layered targeting\" - catego- rising each of the 632 seats in which a Liberal Democrat can- didate will be standing and establishing how much effort should go into fighting it. The plan is primarily the work of Mr Des Wilson, who has been at his post of cam- paigns manager for about 18 months. He is emphatic that planning this use of the party's resources does not mean that some votes do not count. \"It's not our strategy to target seats, but we're targeting seats within the strategy. We're fighting every seat for every vote and we mean it.\" In discussion with the party at regional and national levels, each constituency is being given objectives. In most of the seats where aiming to win is other than quixotic, the achievement would be at the expense of the Tories. There are only five seats in which the third party came within 5,000 votes of the Labour MP in 1987. For areas where the party has scarcely had a presence, the objective might be an increase in membership or sim- ply publishing an election address. In other seats, it might be establishing the repu- tation of a new candidate or holding second place. The party is also conscious that merely retaining the 21 seats it holds must be a pri- mary objective. Mr Wilson esti- mates an assumed anti-Tory swing makes about half of them safe, but others, such as Mr Simon Hughes' seat in Southwark and Bermondsey, have already been identified as needing a special effort. Officials are keen to empha- sise that the categorisations are far from being based solely on the results in the 1987 elec- tion. The local elections since then are regarded as important Seaside meeting: Paddy Ashdown with party campaigns manager Des Wilson in Bournemouth yesteraay benchmarks, and even the party's disastrous performance in the Euro-elections showed them that support held up in Cornwall and Plymouth. Though the Liberals' tradi- tional strength in the south-west means that region contains a high number of tar- get seats, the same does not seem so true of the other \"Celtic fringe\" areas where many of the party's MPs have their constituencies. In Scotland, apart from Kin- cardine and Deeside, where a by-election is due, their best prospect seems to be Edin- burgh West, where a swing of less than 2 per cent would unseat Lord James Douglas- Hamilton, a junior Scottish office minister. In Wales, the best target looks like Conwy, where Sir Wyn Roberts, a Welsh office minister, is defending a major- ity of less than 4,000 against a Liberal Democrat who has fought the seat twice before. The strategists also take into account more personal factors such as a particularly strong candidate or good local party machine. At Southport in the last election and in the Ribble Valley by-election the party benefited when a long-standing and popular MP stood down. With the aim of maximising that effect again, the party has particularly in its sights seats such as Falmouth and Cam- borne, where Mr David Mudd is standing down. The Liberal Democrats also believe that Mr Sebastian Coe, the athlete, will have a hard Job to match his predecessor's 5,000 majority. Squally, the continuing presence of an MP whom the party believes can be presented as weak on local issues is seen as a benefit. The party has strong designs on Cornwall north, where Sir Gerry Neale is defending a majority of about 5,500. They say also that a maver- ick MP where the party is in second place can prove \"very uniting from our point of view\". That is what they will be hoping for from the cam- paign in Littleborough and Saddleworth, the seat Mr Geoffrey Dickens currently holds with a majority of just over 6,000. Beyond the high-profile seats the party believes it stands a good chance of winning - such as Cheltenham, Hereford, and Portsmouth south - are many where its aim is for the next election to be a \"staging post\" so the party is poised for victory at the election after. A campaign organiser said: \"Very few of our MPs were elected first time round.\" Mr Wilson is tight-lipped about the number and names of seats in each category, but areas of Liberal Democrat suc- cess in the May local elections provide a pointer. While the prospect of a Lib- eral Democrat surge in Gos- port, where Mr Peter Viggers (C) won by a margin of more than 13,000 in 1987, and in Con- gleton where Mrs Ann Winter- ton (C) is defending a majority of almost 8,000 may seem fanci- ful, the party took control of both those local councils in the May elections. Mr Wilson points out that being a high-category seat may not make a vast difference financially: \"Our resources nationally are so limited that there is only an extent to which we can do that anyway.\" Nonetheless, he is on course for his target for the election fund. The real benefit, however, is in the expertise at the disposal of target campaigns, and in the prospect of a media-intensive visit from Mr Ashdown on the campaign trail. In the same way that the Association of Liberal Council- lors has traditionally shared its experiences, so now the party's national headquarters is spreading \"best practice\" and making the most sophisticated briefing available to the most likely seats. Training for candidates, par- ticularly in dealing with the media, and for their agents, is under way. Headquarters and the regions are also encouraging activists from seats where their presence may, effectively, be academic, to work in areas where a strong campaign could be decisive.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Smih, Labour Correspondent A BALLOT on whether to create a 250,000-strong Civil Service union begins today amid increasing acrimony between leaders of the two unions involved over whether the amalgam- ation should proceed. The vote among 128,000 members of the Civil and Public Services Associa- tion follows a similar one last year that produced a slender margin in favour of amalgamation, but which was aborted because of difficulties in distributing ballot papers. This time CPSA leaders are being more forthright in their opposition to the merger with the National Union of Civil and Public Servants. Attached to the ballot paper is a doc- ument outlining 10 ieasons why mem- bers should reject a merger. On the ballot paper, the box to vote against appearsAbove that for votin in avour. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCP general secretary, said yesterday that the CPSA executive's desperation to secure a \"No\" vote had overcome any Judgment on fairness and balance. He said CPSA members were too intelient to allow their nterests to be Ieedso badly by an executive who were concerned about their personal position in a merged union. Mr John Ellis, CPSA general secre tary, said the executive's action fol- lowed a vote by the union's conference to campaign against a merger. Among their 10 reasons for voting against, the CPSA executive say that m agerial grades could dominate a mergedu nion, ensuring their interests are advanced at the expense of former CPSA members.\" A merger would result in a top-heavy administration with increased costs but no guarantee of increased services or efficiency. \"Work has already begun among all Civil Service unions to secure greater cooperation, unity and better use of resources,\" says the iterature. \"That Is the way forward, not simply a merger with the NUCPS.\" Last year members of the NUCPS voted by a margin of three to one in favour of merging. Their leaders believe a merged union, representing about half of Britain's non-industrial civil ser- vants, would be more powerful in pay and other negotiations than the two organisations separately. Voting in the CPSA ballot will take place until October 28, with the declara- tion of the result a few days later. * Leaders of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation including general secretary Mr Clive Brooke will meet Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, this week to push for an increase in a S5 per cent pay offer."

   "text_content" : "David Goodhart profiles the privatisation agencys progress in selling off an east German pharmaceutical company T he Treuhandanstalt, the east German privatisation agency, may one day beregarded a a model institution, besieged by privatisation officials from China and Cuba begging for information about how it managed to sell off east German industry so quickly and effi- ciently. In today's real world it continues to be Germany's favourite punch-bag. East German workers think it is heartless while west German manag- ers think it is ponderous (only 34 per cent of west German managers said it was doing a good job in a recent poll). Some accuse of it selling off east Ger- man companies too quickly and cheaply, others of selling too slowly and bureaucratically. Even where the Treuhand appears to have done a good job selling off a desirable company relatively quickly, and for a tidy sum, the organisation is often subject to threats of legal action and accused of anti-competitive behaviour. A case in point is the sale of Jena- pharm, an east German drug com- pany with healthy earnings potential, to Gehe of Stuttgart, west Germany's biggest pharmaceutical wholesaler. Jenapharm, indirectly connected to the Carl Zeiss optical instruments igroup n Jena, was the monopoly pro- dicer of the birth control pill in the former East Germany; its 2,000 work- ers (at the end of 1990) also produced steroids, antibiotics, and vitamin pills, many for export to the Soviet Union. Dieter Taubert, the 39-year-old head of the company, Is one of the brighter young east German managers. Soon after the fall of the wall he began taking advantage of his new freedom to add several generic drugs to the company's portfollo. Meanwhile, by mid-1990, Gehe had already taken a large stake In the east German pharmaceutical wholesale network. From that base it made an assess- ment of the main drug producers with a view to acquisition. It concluded that Jenapharm had the best reputa- tion among retailers and the most attractive product mix. It also had its own research department with 240 sci- entists. Towards the end of 1990 Gehe talked to the Jenapharm management and in January 1991 made a formal enquiry at the Treuhand. The Treuhand originally received eight enquiries about Jenapharm. It subsequently received four firm offers from Gehe, from Schering, the west Berlin-based multinatioWal drug pro- ducer, and from two other west Ger- man consortia. No foreign were involved and ,no atem W made t attract foreign interest. There were plentiful sources of information for Gehe and the other bidders. All wouidbe purchasers were fre to make their 4own valatios and talk directly to the an t. The DM balance sheet gave a positive sum of DM280m (t78.2m) although t was qualified by various unknowns, and the profit and loss account for the second half of 1990 saw a small loss on sales of DM90m, of which half came from the contraceptive pill Jen- apharm was one of the few larger east German companies that had a posi- tive cash-flow in the first few months after economic union. Negotiations began in spring 1991 with the Treuhand in the unusually happy position of having four serious bidders. After preliminary talks all four were asked to give details of their bid price, their planned invest- ment and the number of workers they planned to keep on. In the first round of negotiations, bids ranged from DM28m to DM70m, promised investment from DMBOm to DM120m and the number of jobs to be retained from 850 to 1,300. But because of the keen interest, and because one of the Treuhand officials involved had previously worked for Schering, the organisation decided to ask Booz Allen, the international con- sultancy firm, to make an outside assessment of the bidders. Booz Allen favoured Gehe and one of the two consortia, and the negotia- tions went on primarily with those two. An initial \"final offer\" accepted by the Treuhand negotiators was rejected by the Treuhand executive as inadequate. A deadline was set for improved offers and Gehe emerged the winner and signed the deal on July 1. Gehe paid DMllOm cash for Jena- pharm, not a huge sum considering that Jenapharm is expecting to make pre-tax profit of DM30m on sales of more than DM200m this year. But the total cost to Gehe, including taking over DM16.5m of corporate debt and DM35m in pension liailiues, was more like DM160m. On top of that Gehe promised to invest DM80m by 1993 and to keep 1,250 jobs. Unlike some earlier Treuhand deals these promises were written into the con- tract with penalty clauses if they are not kept. Gehe bought the land as well as Jenapharm's tour pipnts but the sale price for th and, of about DM12 per 3 metre, IUbe to.eew in s9s and I;bbe may have to pay more. The company alo bad' to provide about DWMOm to cover the cost of environmental damage. Dieter Kimmerer, Gehe finance director, says that cost reductions, new wo practices and Job losses, were n directly aftdr the take- over. He admitted that the company had been pushed into paying more and taking over more liablities than had originally been envisaged but he was confident that Gehe had bought an excellent company that would very soon pay its way. He added that dealing with the Treuhand was not like making a deal in the private sector. KAmmerer, none the less, says the organisation had become far more proessional in its dealings with would-be bidders between deals struck by Gehe in mid- 1990 and the acquisition of Jenapharm inmid-1991. m Schering, however, was furious not to have succeeded and threatened legal action. It had returned to the negotiations towards the end and, convinced of victory, put out a press release announcing that it had acquired Jenapharm. The Treuhand negotiators admitted that Schering had offered more money, but they favoured Gehe mainly because it wanted to keep and expand Jena- pharm's research facilities while Schering with its own research facili- ties, would have found them superflu- ous. Judging from what Sir Leon Brit- tan, the EC commissioner for competi- tion, has said about the Treuhand, Jenapharm would make a classic case for EC Intervention. In an interview in the German newspaper Die Zeit, just after the competition directorate had announced that it intended to keep a close eye on the Treuhand, Sir Leon said: \"If the Treuhand receives a number of offers and accepts not the highest but a lower offer, that is pre- sumably a case of special state assis- tance.\" In the Jenapharm case the Treu- hand did, in effect, offer Gehe favour- able terms in the name of retaining part of the east German research base. That seems a reasonable enough goal, especially as, according to some reports, the number of scientists working in east German industry has ~LI I ~h~ fallen from 86,000 to under 30,000 since re-unification. If such an attitude is none-the-less considered an unacceptable venture into \"industrial policy\" then the same could be said of a large number of Treuhand deals where, for example, an industrial company offering jobs and investment is chosen rather than the higher cash offer of a property speculator. But the fact that the Treuhand does have broader interests than a private company when selling its subsidiaries does not relieve the organisation of the duty to explain its actions clearly. Many companies, such as Schering, feel themselves to be the victim of arbitrary decision-making when \"broader interests\" take precedence over a superior offer. But the Treuhand creates other competition problems which probably should be acted upon. For example the Federal Cartel Office is currently investigating three building compa nies in Cottbus on the Germnan-Polsh border, all owned by the Treuhand, which have allegedly been winning public contracts by bidding under cost, safe in the knowledge that the Treuhand will cover their losses. The building company managers naturally want to keep as many jobs as possible. But to recently privatised competitors in the Cottbus building trade, with no state holding company to cover their losses, the argument looks rather different. This is the last of thee articles on the Truhanid the others were published on August 16 and 2&",

   "text_content" : "ECONOMIC commentators this week will be watching out for new information about under- lying inflationary trends in the UK. The data could shed light on the speed with which interest rates may come down further in the next two months. Last week, chancellor Mr Norman Lamont cut UK inter- est rates by one-half of one per- centage point, to 10%l per cent, partly on the grounds that inflation is falling fast and that the still-fragile signs of any recovery in the economy justi- fied an easing in monetary policy. On Thursday, many econo- mists expect the Department of Employment to announce that the annual rate of rise in underlying earnings across the economy - 8% per cent in June - continued its fall of the past six months and dropped to 8 per cent in July. The annual rate of rise in the retail prices index, 5.5 per cent in July, is also widely anticipated to have come down by a full percentage point in August, a figure which is due to be announced on Friday. Also on Thursday, analysts are expecting the announce- - ment of a further large rise in seasonally adjusted unem- ployment in August. Many believe the figure will be about Unemployment (m) Earnings (%) Total UK 2.4 unemployment 14 2.2 \"11012 2.0 10 1.8 8 1.6 Avwrage eanings 6 1990 91 Sourae: Dt-lmn 58,000, compared with 68,000 in July. Although the German Bund- esbank is holding a regular council meeting on 'Thursday, few expect any change in Ger- man interest rates, which were increased at the last council meeting on August 15. The consensus is that the German economy likely to slow down over the next year, as a result of a levelling off in the surge in demand due to reunification, and in this con- text many in the Bundesbank may well feel that no ftrther rise is justified. There will also be interest in data fom the US on the money supply, retail prices and whole- sale trade, which will prdvide new clues on the rate of the US recovery.

   "text_content" : "G ehe said it planned to keep most of Jena- pharm's east German managers, although not neces- arily In the same positions. Other west German compa- nies which have made acquisi- tions in the east say they Invariably need to put west- erners in charge of finance, marketing and administration. The competence of east Ger- man.. management in other fields varies enormously but they are usually strong in technology and production. Replacing managers is more difficult for the Treuhand itself which, despite the strong flow of companies to the pri- vate sector, still controls more than 7,000 companies. About 1,500 east German managers have been sacked for incompetence or because of their political past, but the Treuhand does not have the resources to parachute in the 30,000 qualified managers which, according to some esti- mates, it needs. Birgit Breuel, the Treuhand chief, admits that \"several thousand\" qualified managers are needed but she also praises the east Germans for their ability to learn- new skills quickly. A few dozen west Ger- man pioneers have gone east to manage companies and the Treuhand has hired - on short-term contracts - hun- dreds more. Also, nearly half of the 1,000 companies with more than 500 workers have established their own supervisory boards. This means that at least occasional advice and guidance is avail- able from western business- men and politicians. - That guidance is often badly needed. To the frustration of Treuhand officials trying to sell Deutsche Waggonbau, the world's biggest railway car- riage maker, the chief execu- tive recently signed a long-term deal with the Soviet Union to sell at, or even slightly below, the cost of pro- duction. The chief executive and most of the other senior east German managers have now been sacked. Jost Prescher, a manager at the prestigious east German machine tool company, Fritz Heckert, says that the reaction of most east German managers to the high cost structures revealed by monetary union was to double prices. He did, uen: nmanagers nooeae however, also point out that Treuhand-owned companies often suffer'special disadvan- tages. \"We have lost a lot of con- tracts because customers do not want to place long-term orders with us and then dis- cover we have been sold to one of their chief competitors.\" Despite those problems and its'having only a sprinkling of western managers, the Tren- hand's automotive sector, con- sisting of about 150 unsold companies, reported in mid- July that 40 per cent of compa- nies were breaking-even or better. Less good news for the Treu- hand's finances is the news that the cost of selling busi- nesses is proving expensive. According to Ken Paulin, a director in the automotive sec- tor, more than 40 companies in the sector have been sold, securing 20,000 jobs and bring- ing receipts of about DM250m (Â£85m) and investment prom- ises of DMSbn (Â£1.7bn). However, liabilities shoul- dered by the Treuhand in order to sell the companies come to DM900m."

   "text_content" : "here is one face that stands out in the Roman crowd this summer. The piercing eyes and clear countenance of Gianlorenzo Bernini dominate the loan exhibition of old master drawings from Oxford's Ashmolean Museum, showing at the Palazzo Ruspoli until September 15. The striking face of one of the most brilliant of Rome's architects leaves' such an indelible impression thlt he almost overshadows the glorious works by Raphael, Michelangelo and Dfirer that have been sent from Oxford. The Palazzo Ruspoli was built in the late 16th century on the Largo Goldoni by the Florentine architect Bartolo\"o Ammanti and it is famous for the grt series of allegorical frescoes by Jao*o Zucchi that decorate the gallery. Te palace has recently been opened for' exhibitions under the auspices of the Memmo Foundation. A series of rooms has been well arranged and lit for the Ashmolean show. The drawings seem to have acquired a new lease of life by being shown against a strong and styl- ishly Italian background of blue watered silk. Bernini is not the only architectural figure from Oxford to be in Rome this September. Twenty-five students from nine countries, who make up this year's Prince of Wales's Summer School in Civil Architecture, have come to Rome from Magdalen College, Oxford. In Rome they are being tutored from the sources of classical architecture, and they will spend the last week of their course at the remarkable Villa Lante, north of Rome, lent to the school by the Italian government. Readers of this column might have enjoyed the sight of their correspondent in hard hat, clambering on a specially erected scaffolding to witness the accu- rate measuring by the students of Bra- mante's cloister of Santa Maria della Pace. There is nothing to beat closely observed architectural details, and the cloister, which was built by Bramante in 1500, reveals both the simplicity and the complexity of the proportional lan- guage of classicism. It was Bramante's first work in Rome and was based on his last work in Milan at San Ambrogio. It is the placing of the slender column of the upper logia directly over the centre of the arch beneath that gives this apparently simple cloister its extraordinary sense of life. The student's other Roman project is to design a home for a new school of architecture on a currently vacant site on the Via Guilia. The challenge is to design a new building that will appear to belong in this 16th century street. It is one of the most handsome streets in Rome and the only one that retains along the whole kilometre of its straight length a sense of one of those artificial theatre perspectives. Standing in the street is actually like being on the stage set that Palladio designed for the Teatro OUimpico in Viii. . Rome is probebly the owl place in' Italy where architecture and theatre work as partners to make the whole city a magnificent stage fi*ciic perfor. mances f baroque ntensi. It is a partidular pleasure this year to MLtwo great masterpieces of western archile. ture emerge at last from years behind the restorers scaffolding. The facade of San Andrea della Valle on the Corso Vittorio Emannele is famillaras rthe backdrop to the first act of bsca. It has been hidden away for restoration for a long time and today t: looks as new and as remarkable as it .ust have looked. when it was eveuth- complted inthe second half of te 17th centiury. It has a complicated arcl tectural history, and what weOl tode is the result of the combined efforts cf three architects, Maderno, Rainaldi and Fontana. It now looks quite sumptuous, with every detail of the sculpted figures by Ferrata revealed. The strange asymmetry of the facade results from the presence of a carved angel only on the left hand side of the facade without a matching one on the right. The story has it that the sculptor was so offended by papal criticism of his first angel that he refused point blank to carve the second one to bal- ance the composition. Artist-client rela- tionships were as difficult then as they are now. The other great revelation in Rome is the emergence from its scaffold of the masterpiece of Borromini - San Ivo della Sapienza. This church was built at the end of the courtyard of the Palazzo della Sapienza between 1642 and 1660. It is one of the most daring and original designs in western architecture and to see it so immaculately restored is a joy. Perhaps its most famous feature is the spiral that twists heavenwards from the lantern. It seems to suggest both the flames that consumed the martyrs and some kind of slippery ramp for angels to slide down from heaven. The central ground plan of this icur s in the form of a hexagon of six triangles that is surrounded by a cle with both concave and convex surifaces. Because of the cramped nature of the site, Borromini could not the thrust of the dome with bu ttre , which explains the unusu- ally solid nature of the sp for the cupola. Whether Borrom=if knew about the ancient circular temple of Baalbek as a source for this design is a matter for speculation. The symbolism of the of this church is also highly and enpdlessly fascinating. It I astildifficult to see the interior of this church, although there is a regular Sun- day imis held there. But search out the courtyard of the palace on the Via della ISapiena for a brigt new vision of one of the most original buildings in the world. Renewal and restoration seems to be the theme in Rome at present. I was interested to see the interior of the recently renovated Palazzo della Esposi- doni on the Via Nazionale. This was one of the great late 19th century public buildings built after the unification of Italy. The architect was Pio Piacentini and his work, like that of the prolific Gaetano Koch, is the subject of serious reappraisal by scholars and critics. The scale and impact of 19th century classi- caism on Rome after the unification of Italy, was staggering and it clearly is time to look closely at that neglected period of Rome's architectural history. The revamping of the Palazzo della Esposizioni was carried out by Profes- sor Dardi, who has imposed an elabo- rate high-tech lighting and air condi- tioning grid on the building that bears little relationship to the classical revival style of the original. But what- ever is done in Italy is done with panache and a faith in the almost divine qualities of good design. Rome renews itself all the time and so is always the most rewarding of architec- tural experiences. Colin Amery",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALBERT HALL, RADIO 3 Andrew Porter greeted Tippett's setting of W. B. Yeats on this page when it arrived in New York in April, a few days after the world premiere in Chicago. The first performance in Europe took place at the Proms on Friday; as in the US, it was sung by Faye Robinson, here with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis. In a fascinating programme note, Meirion Bowen described Tippett's setting as thriving on the \"Yeatsian polarity between the actual and the visionary\", a return to self-contained musi- cal utterance after the large- scale extra-musical explora- tions implicit in The Mask of Time and New Year. Certainly Byzantium seems more sustained and concen- trated than either of those. The five stanzas are shaped into a satisfying arch, linked by the tersest of interludes, interlaced by recurrent motives; the musical ideas are vivid and potent, the vocal lines richly complex. The brass calls that summon the image of the holy city in the introduction are cousins of the fanfares conjur- ing up Troy at the opening of Kibg Priam, while the rich-tex- tured string chords that under- pin the soprano's ripest lyri- cism have the luminous intensity of the great set-pieces of The Midsummer Marriage. For though the sound world of Bypantiun is typical of Tip- pett's scores of the 1960s, it is The Midsummer Marriage almost 40 years older, that seems its closest spiritual twin. The libretto of that opera ends with a couplet from another Yeats poem, and the shapes and inflections of the new vocal line bring together ele- ments from the arias for both Jenifer and Sosostris, drawing upon the firm-footed reality of the one, the unblinking visions of the other. It is a compelling piece of artistic renewal, as beautiful as anything Tippett has written for two decades. Robinson was a wonderfully agile interpreter, better bal- asiced in a tape of the Radio 3 relay than she was in the hall but still unclear in her enunci- ation. The words as launch- pads for the music need to be heard; Byzantium magically fuses the two. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALBERT HALL, RADIO 3 On this showing, the Boston Symphony justifies its place in the first division of interna- tional orchestras with ease. The equality of tone and cer- tainty of phrasing which run deep through its ranks are mightily impressive, a feature which seems to be peculiar to the best of the American orchestras, where no hint of slackness is ever felt. The Bos- ton SO certainly carries no passengers and that is the source of its strength. So any doubts about this concert must be addressed to the conductor. When Seiji Ozawa visits us, he is invari- ably at the head of a top for- eign orchestra. He gets each to play exceptionally well. He can conjure clouds of wondrous sounds and myriad sparks of orchestral virtuosity with a wave of his baton in the man- ner of the best orchestral magi- cian. But somehow he manages to produce a dead rabbit out of the hat almost every time. This programme opened with Beethoven's Eighth Sym- phony, which encapsulated all his strengths and weaknesses. In many ways it was an exem- plary performance, full of energy and still with time to savour lyrical moments; but every dramatic gesture was so well rehearsed and produced to order as to deny it any force at all. The fiery exhilaration of great Beethoven conductors like Jochum or Sanderling was simply not there. In the second half Berioe's Symphonie fantastique did come alive in a genuinely fren- zied ending, though the earlier stages had again been too neatly calculated. Technically the standard of playing was first-rate. The lead trumpet consistently per- formed marvels, as did the dev- ilish E flat clarinet in the witches' sabbath, while the clarity which allowed them to be heard so easily was a trib- ute to all the other musicians. Ozawa, as the Boston Sym- phony Orchestra's Music Direc- tor since 1973, must take his own share of the credit for that. His and the orchestra's fortunes are inextricably bound up together.

   "text_content" : "GUILDFORD CIVIC HALL For dance-lovers, one of the most intriguing aspects of perestroika has been the increased freedom for Soviet dancers to venture into the west. Over the past few years we have seen artists given a chance to find work for them- selves, to accept responsibility for their theatrical destinies. Touring companies have sprung up - some of them no more than a convenient agglomeration of dancers eager to find new opportunities and hard currency - to satisfy a seemingly insatiable appetite for \"Russian ballet\". There are problems inherent in this situ- ation, not least the limited rep- ertory available (the old clas- sics have to be the staple fare), but we are at an historic moment when real possibilities for artistic exchange can bring huge benefits to both Russian and western ballet. Significantly, four Moscow- based troupes are to be seen in Britain during this autumn. I caught up with a regional tour by Moscow Festival Ballet at Guildford on Friday night. The company is in its third year of existence, boasts some 36 danc- ers, and offers the statutory classical gems to its public, with no stage design but an adequate orchestra. There is nothing wrong with that, since the troupe is clearly intended to play in medium-to-small locations. The Civic Hall in Guildford can accommodate - just - the 18 swans who are the complement for the second act of Sloan Lake, which opened the evening, and I respect the way in which the well-drilled ensemble pre- served the outlines of the tradi- tional Soviet text. The joy of the occasion was to find that the company - which visited Britain briefly last year - had acquired Lubov Kunakova as a guest. A senior ballerina of the Kirov, she shone in Swan Lake during the company's Coli- seum visit last year. In the close quarters of the Civic Hall she yet produced a reading whose distinction of means had an Ingres-like clarity and unerring line. She was well partnered by the elegant Vik- tor Fedorchenko. The rest of the evening brought an assemblage of clas- sical divertissements, with numbers extracted from Bay- adere, Laurencia, Giselle and The Flames of Paris. This last brought some enchanting dancing from two young artists whom I hope I have correctly identified as Marina Shebolen- kova and --rgey Savoschenko. (The programme book is a mine of alternative castings and disinformation; a hurried listing of events from the stage is impossible to follow). Both Shebolenkova and Savos- chenko were bright, fresh, infectiously happy in their technical prowess, and they nipped through difficulties with the sweetest zest. There was also, of course, Fokine's Swan in extremis. The text was distinctly odd; the dancing by the Lithuanian ballerina Yolanta Valekaite - whom I admired last year with the company - was distinguished by its restraint and lyric ele- gance.

   "text_content" : "The new Royal Opera season began on Saturday, and it began very well. We heard what must be the third or fourth revival of Nuria Espert's Rigoletto production (now staged by Jeremy Sutcliffe), but this time the singers fully lived up to Ezio Frigerio's grandly looming sets, which seemed deeper and more sinise- ter in Bruno Boyer's lighting. The principal trio, all making their first Covent Garden appearances in these roles, offered some excellent Verdi- singing and plausible drama such as only a well matched trio can generate in Victor Hugo's guignolesque tale. Mariella Devia is the new Gilda (until September 28, after which Alida Ferrarini assumes the role): light, true, prettily stylish. A slight edge had van- ished by \"Caro nome\", which boasted not only real depth of sentiment, but in her cadenza an impeccable, bell-like excur- sion up into Miss Devia's \"Queen of the Night\" territory. Later she was touching in her fatal youth's disguise. Rigoletto is the veteran Leo Nucci, still capable of poignant force, and not shy about playing the Hunchbacked- Jester stereotype in the court scenes. It is a premise of the opera that he has something to be guilty about, a reason to feel justly threatened by Mon- terone's curse (angrily deliv- ered by Roderick Earle, if not in the ideally doomy tones). Modem Rigoletti often indulge themselves with the notion that they were trapped by cir- cumstances: that is too modern for the text, and sentimental. Nucci will be succeeded from September 24 by Matteo Manu- guerra, and from October 9 by Piero Cappuccilli. As the unre- generate Duke, young Giu- seppe Sabbatini stays longer (until September 28, when Franco Farina takes over), and is eminently worth hearing. Until six years ago he was a double-bass player; now he is a tenor who wields a sharply stylish line with confidence, and acts intelligently enough to make something quite com- Poignant force: Leo Nucci as iugoletto piex and moving of his Act 2 scena. He earns more good marks for returning to his overbear- ing-cad persona in the scene by the Mincio, with no hint of remorse. Near the top, the voice becomes slightly steely and white: his needlessly sus- tained last note in \"La donna 6 mobile\" was unworthy of the elegant waywardness - a little too wayward for the conduc- tor's forthright instincts - with which he had freshened that old number. The forthright conductor is Sian Edwards again, who must still develop a rapport with Italian singers to match her admirable drive and her ear for orchestral colour. Never mind: she played no small part in making Act 2 exercise a real, old-fashioned grip, and the impetus carried through the final act. Patricia Bardon's Maddalena was a great asset, articulate and penetrating and sexy. I worry a little about the stage-storm: it is terrific, culminating in a real downpour, but the sense of contrivance is awkward before a final scene which has to wring our withers. David Murray",

   "text_content" : "SALISBURY CATHEDRAL The Prince of Wales is in the ideal position to make people offers they cannot refuse and his invitations to selected artistes to get down to Salis- bury and sing for the spire pro- duced the kind of bill usually compiled by theatrical agents suffering from delirium tre- mens. There were Domingo and Jessye Norman as the heavies from the operatic world; Charl- ton Heston and Kenneth Bran- agh to represent the stars of stage, screen, and pseudery; Peter Donohoe and Ofra Har- noy striking up for the concert platform; and Phil Collins rep- resenting the common man, millionaire class. Aided by more than 10,000 charitable groupies, Friday's gala in the Cathedral Close should produce most of the Â£1.5m. still needed to ensure that Salisbury's wobbly 400- foot spire lifts the spirits for another seven hundred years. Speeded on its way by a prayer from the Dean, the occasion was more pleasurable than most command perfor- mances, when everyone is on their best behaviour and playing safe with party pieces. The quality of the artistes virtually guaranteed success, especially if you were sitting in the second row and could see Domingo's chest inflating as he pulled himself together for the high notes of Verdi and Puc- cini. He judged the audience well and ended with the schmaltzy \"Be my love\", ensur- ing a bigger ovation that that commanded by Norman who stuck to the class stuff, four songs by Richard Strauss. But while the great voices brooked no critical argument, the evening was made by Phil Collins. Slouching on to a stage emptied apart from his piano, this \"decent bloke\" was the first performer to notice the crowd. He had been preceded by Charlton Heston describing the entry of the Israelites into the Promised Land with a dra- matic frenzy which would ensure rapid promotion among the less inhibited Scottish Elders. Collins lowered the tone nicely: \"A hard act to fol- low, God\" - leaving it open as to whether he was referring to the jut-jawed, burning-eyed, Heston or to the Almighty. He then invited us all back next week for a similar benefit for the roof of his house. After Collins everyone relaxed and enjoyed them- selves. You could even forgive Branagh's knowing smile as he declaimed the best bits from Henry V, against Patrick Doyle's exhilarating music, from his recent film about our director's crusading ancestor. But with Handel's firework music (boisterously played by a hard worked English Cham- ber Orchestra under Richard Armstrong) dispatching rock- ets by the hundred into the sky and Jerusalem to finish off the evening, any incipient tedium was scotched. Indeed, the vocal fervour with which the audience took up Blake's passionate dedica- tion to his native land, inspired, no doubt, by the visual beauty of the setting, the emotional uplift from the performers, and the justice of the cause, suggested that the Prince of Wales had touched the right popular nerve through this ambitious event.

   "text_content" : "THE FOREIGN ministers of the European Community came to Brussels on Friday to discuss how to conclude long- drawn out negotiations on EC association agreements for the three central European states: Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. They saw the need for prompt action to underpin the transformation of these coun- tries into stable market econo- mies and incorporate them within the ambit of the Euro- pean Community. Then, far from conquering, they ran away from their responsibili- ties. They refused to agree to liberalisation of imports of food and textiles, preferring instead to postpone the issue until the end of the month. Many outside the EC take the view that if one scratches the EC one finds little more than a protectionist trading bloc. This is a slander, but by its behaviour in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks within the Gatt, and now again in relation to the coun- tries of eastern and central Europe, the EC has gone some way to make it seem true. Thus, bowing to pressure from Portugal, the EC minis- ters decided to delay a decision on ending quotas on central European textiles until agree- ment had been first reached in the Gatt talks. This is a cun- ning move: because of the EC's obduracy over farm policy, that agreement looks a long way off. Risible increase Similarly, confronted with opposition from France, keenly supported by Belgium and Ireland, the EC ministers failed to agree to allow more imports of meat from central Europe, even though the proposed increase in the first year of the agreement on beef would have been less than 0.01 per cent of EC consumption. True to its farm policy traditions, the plan is for the EC to fund eastern European dumping into the Soviet market instead. But this would be little more than a short-term palliative. If a relatively poor country such as Portugal or Ireland needs help to adjust to the loss of export earnings, such help should be given. The policy of the EC as a whole should not, however, be held hostage to the sectional interests of small member countries. As for France, arguably the EC's most influential single member, its government needs to close the gulf between its pretensions and its performance on the global stage. The issues at stake are too important for its current political games. Smug protectionism The contrast between the scale and political riskiness of the adjustments now occurring in eastern Europe and the smug protectionism of the western part of the continent has, in fact, become little short of scandalous. Countries of eastern and central Europe have experienced huge declines in output, soaring unemployment and the col- lapse of trade with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the EC, gaz- ing fixedly at the navel of its inter-governmental confer- ences on economic and politi- cal union, has failed to begin serious reform of its absurd farm policies. It has been pre- pared to watch the interna- tional trading system disinte- grate, and has refused to provide a commitment to open markets for neighbours now painfully emerging from the dark night of communist tyr- anny. The countries of eastern and central Europe must suspect that the EC preferred them shackled. Then, after all, its members would not have been required to adjust to increased competition in their farm and textile sectors. But they must also be wondering what they have done to deserve their friends. First, they had to sus- ser the ineffectual efforts of the western allies to secure their independence before the Sec- ond World War. Then they had to accept the embrace of their fraternal Soviet \"liberators\". Now they have to put up with apparently empty protestations of friendship from the EC. What the EC is doing is a serious error. The foreign min- isters have postponed the issue of the association agreements until the end of the month. What is needed, instead, is a meeting of the European Coun- cil, the council of heads of gov- ernment, devoted to the EC's responsibilities as a trading power at both the regional and global levels. Those responsi- bilities have been evaded too long; they should be evaded no longer.",

   "text_content" : "THE DATE of the next general election may be in doubt, but the campaign starts today. Britain is occasionally envied, particularly in the US, for the brevity of its electoral process. In the US, squaring up to presi- dential campaigns seems to start shortly after the mid-term elections to Congress. The Brit- ish prime minister tradition- ally announces a date that allows only three or four weeks to polling. This time the par- ties are off the mark anything between two and six months before the voters are likely to be asked to decide. They will set out their stalls at the series of conferences that begins with the Liberal Democrats today and ends with the Conservatives on October 11. Contrary to con- ventional wisdom, the process is likely to reveal important differences between the con- tenders. The strong ideological currents of the 1960s may have abated, but the next election in Britain will settle more than the technical question of which assemblage of career politi- cians is best qualified to man- age a market economy. The three possible outcomes - a Conservative victory, a Labour victory, or a hung parliament - are not all of a piece. The Conservatives are better placed to win than they were at the start of the summer, but they have yet to demonstrate that they would promote fur- ther radical reforms.

It has learned, doubtless from Mrs Thatcher, the value of fiscal prudence. Its proposals for tak- ing public control over water are mitigated by the unlikeli- hood that it would be able to afford to do so. It is no longer unilateralist; nor does it pro- pose to withdraw from the EC. Questionable liaison It remains, however, the Sarty of big government, her taxation and a still questionable liaison with the trade unions. Every problem it perceives is to be solved by a mechanism financed, managed, or promoted by an official body. The top rate of personal taxation would be increased from the present 40 per cent to 59 per cent. As to party man- agement, even when the union vote is reduced, as it will be under present proposals, trade union bosses will remain pow- erful The protestation that as prime minister Mr Kinnock would be no pushover for pro- ducer interests has to be taken on trust. With no hope of winning, the Liberal Democrats are best placed to offer radical ideas, not all of them new.

   "text_content" : "Vaesa oul lerinthe biggstonumen to London's property glut 3 office stock, i:-an the n gw ts Itcurvid rooy and glass belly is one of Lon- don's most flamboyant exam- ples of post-modern architec- But whatever its architec- tural merits, Alban Gate is most famous for the jibe that it is the City's biggest white ele- phant. At 400,000 sq ft, it is the largest empty building in cen- tral London. There has never been a worse time to be looking for tenants in the City. The com- pletion of Alban Gate in November will coincide roughly with the City's highest recorded vacancy rate. It has almost 1im sq ft of unoccupied offices, about 18 per cent of the total stock, according to Debenham Tewson Research, the chartered surveyor. \"The figures are by any standard - absolute, historical or what- ever - awful,\" says Mr Chris Walls, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. The recession has come just at the culmination of the City's biggest building spree. Demand is half what it was three years ago and the trickle of lawyers and financial services compa- nies looking for new space are spoilt for choice. Officially, MEPC, Alban Gate's developer, is asking for Â£45 per sqft in annual rent. Agents and brokers think the company would be lucky to get Â£40 and it could get as little as Â£30. Even taking the more opti- mistic figure, however, the building is unlikely to break even. According to estimates by Kleinwort Benson Securi- ties, it is worth Â£160m - Â£50m less than it cost to build. Sympathy for MEPC's pre- dicament is limited. \"Why did they embark on this massive development in the City?\" demands Mr Walls, MEPC's most vocal critic. \"You cannot justify it. What is the matter with this company? They are incapable of doing the most basic research.\" Although MEPC cannot shrug off all the criticisms, it resents the accusation that it charged into the City at the height of the market. \"When City rents jumped from Â£30 to Â£60 per sqft following Big Bang, we didn't immediately rush out and buy City sites,\" says Mr James Tuckey, manag- ing director. I did see, uhowever, an opportunity to upgrade its existing portfolio in the City, distinguished by the grey, con- crete towers characterised by John Betieman's phrase \"rent collecting slabs\". One of the worst was Lee House, which it had owned since July 1985 when MEPC bought English Property Cor- poration from the Canadian Reichmann brothers. Built in the mid-1960s, it was a shabby glass block on the wrong side of London Wall with neither the air conditioning nor the space for computer cables a modern office needs. There was not much that could be done with the build- ing. The case for rebuilding seemed evident in the light of the desperate need for new office space on the part of the securities industry. Its head- long growth sent City rents through the roof. These virtu- ally doubled between 1986 and Lydia van der Maor Albamn Gat: derled as the City's blggst white elephant 1988, reaching a peak of Â£70 per sq ft. Agents speculated that prime City rents would reach Â£100 per sq ft by the early 1990s. Pressure from the expanding financial services industry and the growing rivalry of the Docklands inspired a relax- ation of the rigid planning con- trols in the City. In 1986, the City Corporation decided to allow an additional 20m sq ft of office space. This provided an opportu- nity for an audacious rework- ing of the old Lee House. Mr Terry Farrell, the architect, worked out that it would be possible to erect a building on a massive arch straddling Lon- don Wall. The Alban Gate scheme was given planning permission in February 1987 after a 14-month battle. The City Corporation gave MEPC a new 125-year headlease, and the right to land foundations on the south side of London Wall, in return for about 15 per cent of the rental income. It was one of the first schemes to illustrate the City's new approach. Alban Gate, said Mr Peter Rees, the chief planning officer of the Corpora- tion of London, was the type of building the City needed. \"They don't all need to be like that, but we do need some of that size and scale, with their dealing floors and the sort of accommodation they can pro- vide for major bank headquar- ters,\" he said. MEPC decided to go ahead - a decision defended even now by Mr Tuckey. It was not that the company failed to take account of research, but that the research turned out to be hopelessly invalid. With a few notable exceptions, the fore- casts made by the companies and chartered surveying firms underestimated supply and overestimated demand. Even less reliable were pre- dictions about the growth of the financial services industry. As late as 1989, one of the best- known firms of chartered sur- veyor estimated that financial markets would grow by 10 per cent a year, creating 120,000 new jobs in the City by the mid-1990s. Events have worked out quite differently. \"We did not know that there would be such a shake-out in the financial services industry,\" said Mr Tuckey. In the teeth of the recession, the financial ser- vices sector has been forced to reappraise its strategy. Clear- ing banks have announced cuts of several thousands jobs, some large overseas banks are rationalising their operations and securities firms are still shedding staff. The writing has been on the wall for well over a year. But buildings acquire a momentum of their own and property deelp r find it virtally adttoc clr~ircumsa. Delays, how- ever, have made Albn Gate particularly vulnerable. At the outset, it was expected to be finished in early 1980. Part of the reason for the delay was the innovative and complex design. Mowlem, the contractors, said Alban Gate was \"one of the most complex and technically challenging building projects currently under way in the UK\". Its size generated criticisms which continue to circulate around the property market. \"Agents have not been deeply impressed. It is deep and da,\" is one comment. \"The sheer size is very offputting for most clients. They would rather move into a building that doesn't need fur- ther subdivision,\" says another critic. \"Also there is a feeling prevalent amongst one or two people that it has an awful image. It is a white elephant\". The building is also dogged by complaints that it does not have an obvious front door and that its ability to accommodate large trading floors makes it an anachronism. Some of these gripes are unjustified and have been assuaged as agents tour the building. \"The prejudice about darkness and depth has virtu- ally disappeared,\" said Mr lain Watters, a director of MEPC. The charge that Alban Gate was built for dealing rooms is only partially true. From the outset, MEPC tried to ensure that even the three largest floors would be flexible. As the building nears com- pletion, the lack of an obvious front door may become a vir- tue rather than a hindrance. The building has two entrances, allowing for arrival from both the road and the walkway network above ground level. The scale of Alban Gate gives it a vaguely north Amer- ican character. The impression is appropriate as the oversuppl- ied London market increas- ingly takes on the shape of its north American counterpart. As London labours under oversupply figures that are common in the US, landlords have been forced to adopt US- style incentives for tenants, such as rent-free periods, fit- ting-out costs and taking on tenants' cast-off offices. \"Any- one paying, say, Â£38 per sqft for Alban Gate would be disap- pointed to get less than two years rent-free,\" says a City agent. That is the equivalent of knocking another 40 per cent off the price for the first five years. Nobody denies that rents are falling in the City. There is less consensus about their long-term future. Mr Tuckey believes that rents will start to rise again in three years, secur- ing the future of Alban Gate, which will be kept as an investment. \"I am confident in the long-term future of the City. We have seen cycles before. I think the City will bounce back,\" he says. Not everyone is so sanguine. Mr Chris Turner, an analyst at BZW, believes that the creation of new City jobs on the scale of the last two decades is unlikely to be repeated. \"Traditionally the City was brilliant because it had tight planning and high demand,\" he comments. \"Now you have neither. I don't think the City will be the same for 10 years.\" _ Â·",

   "text_content" : "Angus Foster on democratic campaigner Martin Lee MAY I first finish my rice?\" After an hour of reminis- cences, political philosophy and criticism of the Hong Kong government, Mr Martin Lee turns his attention to his din- ner, and falls silent. Mr Lee, patrician, barrister, democrat, Catholic and ideal- ist, is also the most outspoken local critic of the Hong Kong, Chinese and British govern- ments. His political party, the United Democrats of Hong Kong, is expected to win a majority of the 18 seats on offer this week in Hong Kong's first direct elections. The other seats for the 60-strong ruling council will still be indirectly elected by business and trade groups or appointed by the governor. But Mr Lee's perfor- mance in the election will be an important gauge of the desire in the colony for greater democracy. Mr Lee wants full democracy before Hong Kong is handed back to China in 1997. He is not happy with the pace of reform or with plans for only 20 out of 60 seats to be directly elected in 1995. He talks of the UK's broken promises and says the UK is \"kowtowing\" to Beijing, most recently during Mr John Major's visit last week. \"It is highly ironic Mr Major is prepared to criticise China's human rights record while con- tinuing to deny Hong Kong, a British colony, the basic human rights of democracy and free elections,\" he says. Mr Lee was born in China but came to Hong Kong aged 12 with his father. \"Pop\" stud- ied in Paris with Zhou Enlai but later joined the national- ists, becoming a general in the war against the communists. Like father, like son. Mr Lee is detested by Beijing's hard- line leaders. He is regularly attacked in the pro-Chinese press and was expelled from the drafting committee for Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, after his sup- port for the Chinese students during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Nor does he mince his words now on China's future. \"The Pope has said communism is at an end,\" he says. \"And I believe he is infallible.\" With conscious irony, Mr Lee bases his ambitions on a quotation from Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader: \"With a good political system, evil men cannot do evil. With- out a good system, even good men cannot do good.\" He adds: \"That's what Hong Kong needs, a good system. If we have one, it doesn't matter who the [Chinese-approved] chief executive is after 1997. I believe my task is to give Hong Kong this good system.\" Mr Lee's new career as a grassroots politician contrasts with his previous life as a suc- cessful barrister, with cham- bers atop a smart skyscraper on Hong Kong island. But he still drives a Jaguar and is always stylishly dressed. His political aspirations LAW. nut everyune a nero began to germinate in the early 1980s, when many of his friends despaired of Hong Kong's uncertainty and emi- grated. \"I had to decide whether to join them or to stay. My boy was a baby, and I had enough savings to go any- where in the world. But I thought, 'What have I paid back to my people, what have I done for Hong Kong?'\" The decisive moment came in November 1985, when a senior Chinese representative in Hong Kong gave a press con- ference attacking plans to introduce limited democracy. Mr Lee felt impelled to aban- don his previous approach of trying to use his links with Chinese leaders as a \"bridge\" for Hong Kong. \"I thought about standing down from the Basic Law drafting committee and saying nothing. But then I thought, why not fight on? Democracy won't be handed to us on a silver platter: it needs to be fought for.\" Most Hong Kong politicians and businessmen would be derided for using such lan- guage. Mr Lee gets away with it. In recent opinion polls, he scored a 70 per cent approval rate, enough almost to chal- lenge Hong Kong's traditional icons, the Cantonese language pop singers. Mr Lee is not everyone's hero. The government and most businessmen dislike him because his outspokenness jeopardises relations with China. The powerful business lobby also questions whether Hong Kong really wants full democracy. Some say Mr Lee's party merely represents the views of a small group of activ- ists, many of whom are idealis- tic intellectuals. But its cam- paigning for this week's election has been more suc- cessful than expected. Mr Lee may never get the full democracy he is seeking. According to present plans, the number of directly elected seats will be increased to 20 out of 60 in 1995 and then 30 by 2007. China is most unlikely to agree to further reform. But Mr Lee is clear: he will continue to fight for democracy and for Hong Kong's interests even after 1997.",

Sir, Barbara Ellis (Finance and the family, August 24) rightly highlights one of the dangers for unit-linked policy- holders, the value of whose policies can go down as well as up on a daily basis. The prob- lem may be more serious if the policy is a pension one, with a need for immediate income on retirement. The answer in many cases is within the policies themselves. Fund switching can be used for many purposes. A timely switch to a deposit fund, or simply to a less volatile fund, can minimise or extinguish the risk altogether. When to switch depends on circumstances, but in the case of pension policies the correct time may be years ahead of maturity. Switching just before signing the forms at maturity may eliminate problems that would occur following major falls in the markets such as happened recently.

I refer to his review of my book The Economy under Mrs Thatcher 1979-1990 in his Economic Viewpoint (\"A clubland view of Thatcherism\", September 5). However, some of his points demand a rejoinder. 1. I do not assume that Mrs Thatcher wanted a tighter monetary policy than Nigel Lawson in the late 1980s. I only say: \"She failed to overrule him where she should have done, notably on the abandon- ment of monetary controls and the shelling of demand by tax cuts.\" She may have failed because she agreed with him at the time; but there was no one else who could have overruled him. 2. He condemas views expessed by the Treasury Select Commitee about fore casting, the balace of pay- ments, and mnuftacturing, as if they were in my book. They are not. If he disapproves cf other views in my book which were also those the Tkreury Committee, he should con- demn me, not the committee. &.

My determination to do sco was increased by the breath- taking Ignorance among so many people who confuse it with Croatia and who advised me \"to take a helmet\", oblivi- ous of the fact that the Yugo- slav army has been withdraw- ing peacefully ever since its unsuccessful incursion in June, and that Slovenia has a homogenous population with- out ethnic conflicts. My journey could not have been more peaceful. The train was clearly Croatian, its blue and white colours contrasting with the orange of the Aus- trian Bundesbahn; and the bus- set car menu was in Croat, Slo- vene and German. Customs officials wearing the insignia \"Republic of Slovenia\" quickly passed through the train in the Alpine tunnel leading to Jesen- ice; and I was outside the sta- tion, slightly ahead of time. There was not a Yugoslav red star to be seen. The train itself terminated at Zagreb; that was the end of the line, as communications with Belgrade have been cut by Serbia, as part of the attempted total economic blockade on the two breakaway republics. Although there is great con- fidence that Yugoslav military forces will not return to Slo- venia, no-one is taking any chances. The government is believed to possess anti-aircraft missiles, and there are anti- tank defences on the borders with Croatia. This is not typical. Much of Slovenia looks like a part of Austria where they happen to speak a Slav language. (It was part of the Austrian province of Carinthia for many centu- ries and its survival was largely due to its language.) The capital Liubljana seems a sleepy Habsburg provincial town, with its yellow and white buildings and exotic baroque churches. But a closer look shows strong resem- blances to neighbouring parts of north-eastern Italy, which has thrived on the basis of small-scale industry spread through the countryside and small towns, often combined with family farms. The Slovene population of 1.9m is only 8 per cent of the Yugoslav total. But the repub- lic accounts for 19 per cent of Yugoslav gross domestic prod- uct. Slovenia had in 1990 an average GDP per head of $12,600, similar to Austria's and only just behind Britain. This compares with a Yugo- iHIi 65 3-a5ama 7-WIMA ...0....

The Slovene independence movement is partly a response to developments in Serbia. The individual republics and in par- ticular Slovenia had a good deal of autonomy under the 1974 Tito constitution. It is the nationalist-communist Serbian leader, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, who came to power in 1987, who has taken the initiative, either to secure a more central- ised Serb-dominated Yugo- slavia or a Greater Serbia. Even the European Commu- nity foreign ministers, who have unwisely staked so much on a unified Yugoslavia, blamed in their communiqud of August 27, Serbian irregulars, \"for trying to solve territorial problems by military means\" (eg killing innocent civilians). They also accepted that \"ele- ments of the Yugoslav army have been lending their active support to the Serbian side\". Milosevic has been compared not with Hitler or Stalin, but with Saddam Hussein. Some Slovenes believe that the most effective non-military sanction on Serbia, which is desperately short of petrol, would be an oil embargo. Although the independence of the Baltic states has put new heart into Slovene leaders, I found no jingoism. Slovene separatism rests partly on a desire to escape from the chronically weak and crisis-rid- den Yugoslav economy. For some moderates the last straw was the \"raid\" on the Yugoslav central bank at the end of 1990 when it was forced to grant Serbia inflationary credits. (The current rate of inflation is 200 per cent.) Last December some 88 per cent of the Slovene electorate supported indepen- dence in a plebiscite. Slovene leaders are ambiva- lent towards Croatia. They cri- ticise early insensitivity towards the fears of Serbian minorities, but also the readi- ness to hand over to federal Slovenes desire to escape from the chronically weak Yugoslav economy forces the arms of their territo- rial defence, which Slovenia never did. Nevertheless, they realise the fate of the two republics are intertwined and arms are believed to have passed to Zagreb. Can a country of 2m subsist? The Slovene population is in fact more than five times that of Luxembourg and the coun- try's area is half that of Swit- zerland.

   "text_content" : "From Jagdish Bhagwati Sir, Your profile of Dr Man- mohan Singh (\"India's sinan- cial architect\", September 2), the Indian finance minister who has embarked on long- overdue economic reform, needs a corrective. The reforms are attributed by you to a conversion trig- gered by his membership of the South Commission in Geneva since 1967 and by his visits then to South Korea and Taiwan \"where he was much struck by the pacd of economic growth under export-oriented policies\". But his own D.Phil thesis at Oxford showed in the 1950s that India's export poten- tial was underestimated. Besides, a man of reflection and scholarship, he had long been aware of the massive the- oretical and empirical research through the 1960s and 1970s that settled for most of us the debate over import substitu- tion versus export promotion, as appropriate strategies for efficiency and growth, in favour of the latter. Indeed, none of the reforms is newly-conceived. Since the mid-1960s, a few of us were out front, fighting for these reforms, among them the dis- mantling of the licensing sys- tem, greater use of exchange- rate flexibility and shifts to export promotion. It was a hard role to play in an area infested by left-wing economists who confused talking about poverty with doing something about it. The number of converts grew hand- somely in the 1980s. Among them were many who had pre- sided over India's disastrous economic regime. Dr Singh was not one who needed to be converted. If the years in Geneva helped, it must have been by giving him the opportunity to see that the failure of India's economic model had marginal- ised the country in world eco- nomic affairs. Increasingly, India's voice was irrelevant. The resulting anguish has surely marked Dr Singh's con- version, not to the idea of reform, but to the passion that he has manifested in pursuing the reforms that alone can restore India to the status it enjoyed in the 1950s. There is reason to suspect that much of India's elite has increasingly come to share this anguish. There's the reason for opti- mism, even as the reforms run into inevitable difficulties.

   "text_content" : "W ho does David Owen thinks he is? The question is asked seriously and is kindly meant, for even Dr Owen seems to admit that there is a problem of identity. This, his autobiog- raphy, runs to 822 pages. That compares with Lord Callagh- an's 584 pages, Denis Healey's 607 and Lord Jenkins of Hil- lhead's (to be published on Thursday) 658. Lord Callaghan had been prime minister, and had held all three top ministerial jobs before that. Roy Jenkins was chancellor, home secretary, president of the European Commission, part founder of the European Monetary Sys- tem and the man who pre-emi- nently tried to break the party mould of British politics. Healey was defence secretary and chancellor and remains one of the longest-serving fig- ures in British politics. Dr Owen, by contrast, was a young foreign secretary and leader of the now almost defunct Social Democratic Party. He is 53 and leaving the House of Commons at the next general election. The almost inevitable reflection, perhaps especially today as the party conference season opens, is how different it all might have been. Dr Owen could have been leading the party chal- lenging for power, yet for rea- sons hard to fathom he threw it all away. There is a chapter in this book that suggests he is aware of the problem. Called \"First Love\", it describes how he lost his (unnamed) first girl-friend because she did not believe that he was sufficiently com- mitted to her. He then went on to break off his engagement to another woman to whom, it seems, he was equally attracted. It would be easy to say that he was vain, interested only in himself or peculiarly cussed. Yet that explanation does not entirely fit. There have been other occasions when he has been remarkably loyal both to friends and ideas. Nor is there anything particularly odd about his background which could explain his sometimes extraordinary behaviour. Dr Owen may have been a late TIME TO DECLARE By David Owen Michael Joseph, Â£20.00 developer, but he was well-edu- cated and there has never been the slightest doubt of his abil- ity to grasp even the most com- -plicated subjects. On southern Africa or defence he was as informed as anyone. He came to economic policy relatively late, but he still came to it. Nevertheless, the fact remains that at certain critical times in his political life, Dr Owen blew it. The principal political influence seems to have been Hugh Gaitskell; it was because Gaitskell was leader of the Labour party that Dr Owen allowed his name to go forward as a parliamentary candidate in 1962. Perhaps Dr Owen was in the Gaitskell mould, and certainly British politics might have taken a dif- ferent course had Gaitskell The fact remains: at certain critical times in his political life, David Owen blew it lived. When he died, Dr Owen was much less at home in the party of Harold Wilson, George Brown and, subsequently, Michael Foot. Dr Owen might have sur- vived with James Callaghan and Denis Healey, and indeed tried hard to do so. It was only when they allowed the party to move to the left that he decided to break. That was not an eccentric decision: after all, others went with him and Roy Jenkins had been considering the realignment of British poli- tics for some years. The foun- ding of the SDP was seen by many as glad, confident morn- ing. It is sometimes forgotten that the new party seemed to carry all before it until the out- break of the Falklands War suddenly restored Mrs Thatcher's fortunes. With hindsight, not only Dr Owen but all the leaders of the SDP and the Liberals made a fundamental mistake. They should have attacked the Labour party with the aim of replacing it as the main opposi- tion. Such Tory leaders as the now Lords Whitelaw and Pym were at times terrified that that would happen; in which case, there would be serious defections to the new party. In the event, there were very few and the Labour party, under new leadership, began slowly to recover. Dr Owen, however, made additional mistakes of his own. He challenged Roy Jenkins very early for the leadership of the party. He disliked, and let it be known that he disliked, the Liberal party and was opposed to any form of merger. When the two parties failed to make a large breakthrough in the 1987 election, effectively he threw in the towel and refused to have much to do with David Steel, the Liberal leader, in those post-electoral weeks in which the merger was agreed by the vast majority of mem- bers. Even then Dr Owen could probably have been the leader of the new Liberal Democrats. He turned his back on the opportunity. He explains in this book that he was opposed to the Liberals because they were essentially \"federalist\". (That is also, we now learn, why this once pro- nounced European is opposed to many of the developments in the European Community.) The merger, he said at the time is \"basically defeatist. It Is a lack of nerve, and... the lack of nerve comes from the liber- al-minded people in this coun- try because they are the people whose nerve always fails\". Dr Owen appears to have few regrets. \"I am a Social Democrat... .The SDP was des- tined to be the hard Centre.\" As recently as early this year, the top of the Tory party was still seeking his support, as had already happened under Mrs Thatcher. Perhaps the emergence of the SDP did help to retrieve the Labour party. Yet, as he walks away, Dr Owen might note that a third party under Mr Paddy Ash- down, practically written off a year ago, is doing quite well in the opinion polls. He could have been there.

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow and Chrltopher Prkes in Bonn FEARS over the ability of the Soviet Union to maintain for- eign debt repayments have emerged after Mr Thomas All byegov, deputy chairman of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, said Moscow might be forced to request debt resched uling. This, he said, was only the \"worst possible option\" If talks aimed at securing new credits failed. The total Soviet debt stands at more than $60bn (Â£35bn), with $15bn-20bn in short-term debts repayable over the next 2% years. Western economists attend- ing a Moscow meeting of the World Economic Forum said they were convinced that Moscow would soon request debt rescheduling, because of the fall in Soviet oil production and foreign sales.

He said in Bonn that the west should pump in $4bn-$5bn in bridging loans if a debt crisis - or worse - is to be avoided. He also stressed that Moscow's existing financial institutions must be kept intact. In Moscow, senior figures in the Soviet and Russian govern- ments said the rouble would become convertible next year - in spite of fears that this might fuel hyperi2flat1io and cause social unrest.- ir IvanSlayer, thRaussian four-strong Committee for the Manage mntof the National Economy, told the 'forixm on Saturdira \"I thinkwe would be able to do this [make the rou- ble conertible] nt year. I believe it w i hap n I1992.\" This contiasted with pessi- mistic assessments of rouble convertibility given to the con- ference by Mr Alibyegov, sup. ported by Mr Valerian Kulikov, deputy chairman of the State Bank and Mr Ivan Ivanov, an independent foreign trade expert. Mr Kulikov revealed that a committee of bankers and economists had told the previ- ous government of Mr Valentin Pavlov that its aim of internal convertibility by January 1992 was \"an adventurist measure\". He claimed that Mr Pavlov's support for the August 19 coup was born of the desperation he felt about being unable to meet that target. Mr Ivanov said convertibility would require at least $20bn a year for three years from the west to allow the State Bank to support the rouble. Mr Saburov pleaded for urgent humanitarian aid from the west to prevent food short- ages in the coming winter. This will be discussed at talks between Soviet leaders and western foreign ministers who arrive in Moscow today for the opening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In a newspaper interview Mr Saburov said that plans to pri* vatise large parts of the Rus- sian economy immediately had been set aside in favour of pur- suing emergency measures to secure food and fuel supplies, as well as to convert defence industries to civilian production. The Committee for the Man- agement of the National Econ- omy is expected to produce a blueprint of an inter-republi- can economic agreement over the following week.

   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Belgrade and David Gardner and Ronald van do Krol in The Hague YUGOSLAVIA'S federal army and Serb militants tightened their grip over strategic Cro- atian towns yesterday as part of their drive to control the republic's central and eastern regions. The renewed fighting poses a threat to the peace conference which opened in The Hague on Saturday with European Com- munity foreign ministers and representatives of all the Yugo- slav republics agreeing that last week's ceasefire must be \"observed in all its elements immediately\". The conference has adjourned until Thursday. Meanwhile, violence spread to Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, where a cafd used by Chetniks, an ultra-na- tionalist Serb movement, was damaged by a bomb. A man was seriously injured. It was the first known bombing inci- dent in Belgrade since fighting erupted after the declarations of independence in June by Croatia and Slovenia. Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary who is chairing the conference in The Hague, said it would become \"perfectly obvious\" if and when fighting reached a level to sink the talks. Mr Hans van den Broek, Dutch foreign minister and president of the EC Council of Ministers, said Lord Carring- ton represented the \"one, unanimous voice\" of the EC's mediation efforts. Any decision to recognise new states emerging from Yugoslavia \"should be unani- mous and voiced through the chair of the conference\", Mr van den Broek added. The implication is that if Germany - which has called for recogni- tion of Croatia and Slovenia - or any other member state breaks EC ranks, they will sab- otage the conference's work. aae naven: more tan 80,000 people viite an Oad secoB d World War tunnel shelter In the Croatian capital Zagreb yesterday- authorities prepared for a federal air attack Mr van den Broek equally warned the Yugoslav delega- tions that the EC had only \"temporarily refrained from the implementation of steps that could prejudge the out- come\" of negotiations on Yugo- slavia's future. The EC is still holding in reserve the recogni- tion of Slovenia and Croatia. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, told the conference that Yugoslavia was \"the only legitimate and internationally recognised sub- ject\", and that \"the internal boundaries in Yugoslavia are only administrative\". This appeared to fly in the face of EC insistence - and Mr Milosevic's formal agreement - that one of the principles of the conference was that nei- ther internal nor external bor- ders could be changed by force. Mr Milosevic acknowledged that he had links with Serbian paramilitary leaders among Croatia's ethnic Serb commu- nity, but he insisted that they were acting independently. \"They are defending their homes and their families,\" he said. \"There's no one to give them orders.\" Mr van den Broek left open the possibility that minorities such as the ethnic Albanians from the southern province of Kosovo, who are not repre- sented through the six repub- lics, could be given a voice at the conference. This could be construed as a concession to Mr Milosevic, who said partici- pation of Croatia's Serbian minority was \"indispensable\". In the southern republic of Macedonia, early unofficial results of a referendum last night indicated overwhelming support for secession if plans for Yugoslav union of sover- eign 4tates collapse.

   "text_content" : "By Robe t Peton BANKS and building societies plan to offer customers greater protection against misuse of plastic cards and to introduce restrictions on the marketing of financial services, according to a code of conduct that they hope to introduce by the end of the year. The institutions have been working on the code for two years. The first version, pub- lished last December, was dropped after criticism from consumer groups, which cok- painaed that banks were simp coing existing practices. lanks and building societies have responded to two of the Vops' three main criticisms. They have agreed to take esponsibility for proving fraud or ross negligence in the use of a plastic card. At the moment, cardholders debited for using a plastic card when they claim not to have done so, have themselves to furnish proof. If the code is accepted, the burden of proof will rest with banks. They will also have to prove that a card was received by a customer in cases where the customer denies delivery. fanks and building societies want this clause to be extended to all card issuers, including those of store cards. A second Important amend. ment requires institutions to obtain customer permission before owering produt mar- keted by a subsidiary. Ma banks, for example, own e insurance companies and have sought to sell pension products and life policies to their bank curstomers. They will now have to seek customer permission before passing on details of accounts to their life insurance subsidiaries. In the past, banks have resisted this change because they fear the paperwork would be wvery costly. Concern at higher overheuds has also discouraged institt- t-m aom introducn a third reform, which would have meant customers being noti- ed in advance before bank charges were debited from their accommts. Banks say the cost of chang- -g their comptr systems to able them to do ths would b- much more than Sem. They are promising instead to give all customers a fuller break- down of charges. A draft version of the code is being discussed by the Trea- sury, the Bank of England and consumer groups. Views will be passed to a committee headed by Sir George Blunden, former Bank of England de- uty governor, which will decide whether the code is acceptable. Banks want to make sure the code Is satisfactory before it is published, to avoid the humill- tlon of having to withdraw it a second time. The government has warned banks that, if their voluntary code proves unacceptable, it will put in place a statutory code.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent BREL, Britain's biggest railway train maker, faces sweeping management changes and cuts in its work. force following the removal of its chief executive last week. The majority shareholders - Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Trafalgar House, the UK construction group - are insisting on the measures to rescue the company from a deepening crisis caused by failures in its most important railway train product. Brel, formerly the train- making division of British Rall, employs more than 7,000 people in Derby, Crewe and York. It was privatised in April 1989 when it was bought out by a management-em- ployee consortium backed by ABB and Trafalgar House. The two companies own 80 per cent of Brel's shares between them, but have up to now left the running of the company in the hands of the management team which led the buy-out. However, because of the mounting losses and adverse publicity arising from defects in the class 158 express train supplied by Brel to BR's Regional Railways, they have asserted direct control. Already gone are Mr Peter Holdstock, the chief executive who led the buy-out, and Mr Chris Cook, former director of Brl's new construction group. Mr Bo Sodersten, a former ABB executive, has been made chief executive and other man- agers have been seconded by ABB and Trafalgar House. Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar House's representative on Brel's board, said farther changes would come: \"We will be looking at further transfers and boosting the quality of the management team.\" He indicated that more job. cuts could follow the 1,650 redundancies already announced this year. \"The quest for higher productivity is an unending one and it may be that, i the next two or three years, we will have to do a bit more at Brel than we s troubles have prompted fears among the werforce that the company may be rn down, evetually becoming an assembly plant for components brought in from the Continent, where ABB Is a signimeant railway Mr krie Drewery, ABB's lK ny'he menative sa the o the JMlboardu, ud these fas \"Wae a iItention to dimnish the role of Bal ina may wq\" he aid.

   "text_content" : "The authorities at the stock exchange seem bent on making a fuss about the leaks which seem to herald every rights issue. But really, nobody should be too surprised if Chi- nese walls prove to have ears. Dealers are hungry for the kind of information they don't get on their screens. \"Dealing isn't convivial any more,\" a senior stockbroker complained to me the other day. \"I used to go down on the floor and hear what was going on. Now I can get any amount of facts on my screen; but I don't know nearly as much as I used to. It isn't half as much fun, either and I'm not sure it's healthy.\" He has a solid point. The gossip and scandal which used to circulate in the floor mar- kets (the sort of thing that would result in disciplinary measures or worse if it appeared on a screen) was a valuable information system, all the same. It was often inaccurate, and sometimes pure mischief or downright dishonest; but it did suggest where bodies might be buried, and put analysts on the alert. It is hard to imagine a collapse like Polly Peck taking the market by surprise 20 years ago. We cannot job backwards; global markets, trading elec- tronically and dominated by futures and other derivatives, cannot possibly work in the old, intimate way. The kind of ignorance this produces, offi- cially protected by the law against insider trading, helps to explain the tendency of markets to chase their own tails. When what is really outside information is scarce, the mar- ket is reduced to analysing its own behaviour. Now thrive the technical analysts, the experts on self-induced fluctua- tions. All this is a relatively trivial (though not unimportant) example of a general problem: the information age has become an age of ignorance and guesswork. Governments and central banks are in the same boat. Economic models. lwhichused to hive quite stable parame- ters are now constantly pulled. into the pits for overhaul; their mathematics cannot keep up with the changes in the real world. With their instruments out of order, those who used to try to steer the economy simply lash the helm, whether they call it a medium term strategy, an ERM priority, or a Gramm- Rudman law. The economy, however, does not behave as if anyone was steering a steady course. The novelty is that booms and By Anthony Harris slumps seem nowadays to come as a total surprise to those in charge. The money supply in all its definitions has also gone ape, spreading alternate alarm and despondency among the few who still study it. The central bankers have largely given up targeting. Instead, they talk impressively about stable prices while they fumble with their levers; but \"stability\" is not the adjective you would chose to describe their actions. A reader kindly gave me a history of interest rates back to the earliest records: you have The money supply in all its definitions has also gone ape, spreading alternate alarm and despondency among the few who still study it to go back almost to Baby- lonian times to find rates as high or as volatile as they are today. The wise central bank- ers find this worrying; the complacent seem to find it rather fun. None of this is meant as a criticism of current economic management, though it does suggest that there was some- thing a little foolhardy about the way we deregulated every- thing in the 1980s without waiting to see how freedom worked out. All the same, considering the problems posed by floating exchange rates, mobile interna- tional capital, oil frights and the rest, the performance is surprisingly good. Despite the warnings of credit analysts, there is still only a small out- side chance that the Big Bang will result in a big crash. These warnings are not fool- ish in principle, only exagger- ated. This s not ,a recession like other post-war recessions; it is not at heart an economic downturn, but a controlled financial crisis. This may rouse thoughts of 1929, when banks failed and markets crashed; but the simi- larities are again superficial. The heart of the crisis is not financial folly, but the world- wide rise in interest rates. Not even the combined weight of the central banks could sustain these rates in a genuine depression, even if they wished to. In the 1930s there was inade- quate demand for capital. Now there seems to be too much. It is the resultant high rates which have thrown out fiscal and business plans, and deflated asset markets. This explanation leaves us little the wiser, though, for nobody seems sure of the cause of it, nor the cause of the gen- eral fall in private saving which is part of the picture. As long as we do not know the cause, we cannot know if this is a passing phase, or a picture of the future. It is easy enough to tell a story of the future which looks like the present, based on the needs of the fast emerging economies of the far east, Latin America, and now the ex- communist countries, later to be reinforced as the ageing populations of Europe and Japan retire. The market, in this picture, is trying to push the industria- lised countries towards their destiny as frugal exporters and pension-payers, but meeting strong resistance from our high-spending habits. (Less resistance in the US than here, since luxury consumption is now reported to be going out of fashion in the US.) But this is only a plausible story until economic analysis catches up with the real world. The only honest statement is that once you penetrate the fog of ignorance caused by struc- tural change, bad economic models and misleading accounts, you come to a mys- tery. In a -word, uncertainty, the greatest enemy of confi- dence. The earnest forecasters in the international organisa- tions are now hedging their bets so thoroughly that they could drop the whole appara- tus of numbers and charts, and simply print \"Don't know\" on every page. Most businessmen and con- sumers are in the same fix. So don't believe politicians who talk of recovery and virtuous circles. They aren't necessarily wrong, but they can't possibly know.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Peter Norman reports that the Treasury is puzzled by the case for an early UK move THE DATE of Britain's next general election is not the only matter prompting speculation in financial markets. The approach of next month's first anniversary of sterling's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem has coincided with a revival of interest over whether the pound should move to the narrow bands of the ERM. Since becoming a full mem- ber of the EMS, sterling, like the peseta, has been able to fluctuate against other ERM currencies within a 6 per cent margin. However, for most of the past 11 months it has moved safely within the 2.25 per cent band accorded to the core BEMS members. Since mid-April it has shown remarkable stability by moving within 1 per cent either aide of its DM2.95 central rate. Until last October, the pound was one of the most volatile of European currencies. It now appears as placid as the Bel- an ranc. And yet, Mr Norman Lam- out, the chancellor, has been able to bring down base rates from 14 per cent in mid-Febru- ary to 10.5 per cent last week. This impressive performance has weakened, but not crushed, the argument that narrow band membership woud help bring interest rates down. Only last week, Mr David Kern, National Westal- star Bank's chief economist, said that m to the narrow band no wol enae the eanellor to contine catting tead. star8n s stability has encouraged proCmmuu- nity romeentatos to e 81la% of thwe mrn bah sumutt an laresean omm ad nretanry ane ia DIONbW.

That record alone suggests that Bank watching could become a profitable activity for the City. One company that needs no persuading is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. It has recruited Mr Nick Parsons, group economist of Union Dis- count, to be head of CIBC's treasury advisory group from October. In this position he will draw on his six years experience in the discreet world of the dis- count houses to watch the Bank. Virtuous Circles No sooner had the financial markets digested last week's base rate cut than they started speculating on another one. Optimism was given a fur- ther boost by the prime minis- ter's talk on Friday of a \"virtu- ous circle\" of increased spending and growth in the economy. If research by Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage house, is any guide, the government could also be poised to reap the bene- fit from a virtuous circle in fianial markets.

   "text_content" : "Iy Roland Rudd BONDHOLDERS in Brent Walker, the troubled leisure Troup, are backing a new rescue -roposal from the international donglomerate Lonrho and are threatening to put the group into liquidation unless banks which have lent Â£1.5bn give the plan a fair hearing. Their position puts them on a collision course with the 47 banks whose steering committee is today expected formally to reject Lonrho's proposal. This involves swapping convertible mreference shares in exchange for Â£lbn of Brent Walkers's debt. Mr Paul Spicer, a Lonrho direc- tor, said the offer would allow the banks to recover the Â£1.5bn they have lent to Brent Walker it Loanrho's share price, which closed on Friday at 241p, rises to 400p within the next five years. However, most of the banks oppose the offer because of Lon- rho's insistence in conducting a due diligence audit of the corn- pany. Brent Walker fears this take as long as two months, by which time it will have run out of finance. Lonrho says the exercise could be done within two to three weeks. A spokesman for the bond- holders yesterday warned that unless Brent Walker \"seriously considers\" the Lonrho offer they will not agree to drop all legal claims against the company, aris- ing from t admission that its interim profits had been inflated last year. Bondholders, meeting today at the City offices of Hambro, have been told by the company that administrators will be appointed unless they waive their claims. Over the past ten days there have been meetinga between Lon- rho directors and some of the big- gest bondholders, Including Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Irish-based Jefferson Smurfit, and Mr George Walker, Brent Walker's founder who was recently forced out as chief exec- utive. Mr Spicer said Lonrho's pro- posal offered a better deal than they would receive under the banki's reconstruction plan. It would also give Brent Walker's lenders about 50p in the pound via a Â£900m nine-for-ten issue of preference stock with a S per cent coupon with the pros pect that they would recover all their money if the share price rose, he said. Mr Ken Scobie, Brent Walker's chief executive, said the offer was a \"dead duck\". He dismissed it as an *irrele- vant and opportunistic attempt to undermine the interests of shareholders, bond holders and creditors alike\"."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-09",
   "text_content" : "Peter Martin and Richard Waters hear the new management's plans \"I AM almost beyond em- barrassment at this point,\" says Mr Deryck Maughan, the new day-to-day boss of Salomon Brothers. \"But I do take personal exception to the notion that Salo- mon Brothers is rotten to the core, that it is culturally defi- cient, that we are endemically criminal.\" As that comment suggests, the revelation that Salomon Brothers' traders had rigged some recent government auctions for US Treasury bonds has cast a deep shadow over the firm and its employees. Salomon's former chairman, Mr John Gutfreund, who was told about a breach of the rules in April but failed to declare the information until August, has resigned. Other senior officers have also gone, and Mr Maughan, a former British civil servant who made his reputation running the firm's Japanese operation, was last month unexpectedly cat- apulted into the job of chief oper- ating officer. Now he must restore the reg- ulators' faith in Salomon Brothers' integrity and internal controls, and recapture those prominent clients - such as the World Bank, the California state pension funds, and the UK Trea- sury - which have partly or wholly slipped away. To do this, he freely admits the seriousness of what happened, and management weaknesses that allowed it to happen. The \"tone\", as Mr Maughan puts it, that was set by the for- mer senior management needs to be changed; the firm's payment and promotion policies need revising; and the old collective arrogance - which some would see as the heart of Salomon's mystique and success - must go. In each of these areas, Mr Maughan's approach means, in effect, the partial or complete repudiation of John Gutfreund. Only a month ago, that would have seemed unthinkable. Mr Gutfreund epitomised Salomon's aggressive take-no-prisoners style and its relentless focus on trad- ing profits. \"I do not deny that John Gut- freund set a certain tone.\" says Mir Maughan. \"John was a very dominant personality. I think that he believed in, certainly per- mitted, a certain macho style of doing things.\" How much did Mr Gutfreund know about what the Treasury trading desk was up to? \"I just don't know what he knew,\" says :Mr Maughan, \"but most people inside the firm would be very surprised if he knew and con- doned this behaviour\". s that a personal opinion? \"My position is that I simply don't know. rm an agnostic.\" Mr Gutfreund's once legendary omniscience about the firm's trading activities had lessened in recent years, says Mr Maughan. \"There was a time when John did sit on the desk, and lived the life that everyone thinks he leads of being the ultimate bond trader, calling the auctions, pricing the new issues, walking the floor, flicking his cigar. I think that was true from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.\" As Mr Gutfkeund focused more on visiting clients, and managing the firm overall, he was no lon- ger \"on top of the day-to-day trad- ing.\" None the less, once he learnt that Salomon had submit- ted bids in the name of clients without their consent, in order to Lydia van der Mear Deryck Maughan: \"We're coming through it better than we deserve, in some ways.\" control a greater proportion of the issue than the rules allowed, he should have acted much more speedily - above all to prevent the senior trader responsible from repeating the market-rig- ging abuses on a still more spec- tacular scale in the May auction. To avoid such problems, Salo- mon Brothers needs \"a more open, more co-operative\" man- agement style, a change that was already under way before the mandal. \"Therbhatbeen a gener- ational change and John Gut- freund had come to represent the past.\" If Mr Maughan has his way, the new Salomon Brothers will replace the firm's traditional every-man-for-himself internal Darwinism with a new emphasis on collegiality. Above all, per- haps, the new Salomon will be less arrogant, abandoning what Mr Maughan calls \"this swagger- ing style\". Yet if the firm is less arrogant, more controlled, less internally competitive, will it ever be as profitable again? In Mr Gut- freund's last half-year, after all, the firm made $451m in after-tax profits, a record. \"I think you can combine good business and good ethics,\" says Mr Maughan: Salo- mon might even widen its appeal to clients if it were seen as less arrogant. Other irms, says Mr Maughan, in a clear reference to Salomon's arch-rival Goldman Sachs, where he once worked, \"combine good ethics, good management, with very aggressive business\". The thought that the new man- agement wants Salomon Brothers to be more like Goldman Sachs is one that will send shivers down tspines of nyof Sao 's nercejy competitive traderspi Mr Mlaughan achieve such a 'hI in culture without endangering the profits that flow from its risk- taking enthusiasm? \"We do want to maintain that energy, that drive, but I think it can be har- nessed,\" he replies. \"We really want the traders to continue to trade. We just want them to do so within the bounds of the law.\" here that has not hap- pened, Mr Maughan says Salomon is ready to take its punishment: \"We want swift and sure justice, we want to pay our penalties.\" Just how big those penalties will be depends in part on how many more revelations there will be. \"If what we know now is 90 per cent of what there is to know,\" he says, \"then we will survive and we will come out of this a stronger firm\". Without further amazing reve- lations, he believes the regulators will stop short of truly damaging punishments, such as withdraw- ing Salomon's various licenses or stripping it of primary dealer sta- tus. They have no wish, he thinks, to put the firm out of busines. \"No one's going to be .stQiQi Salomow, but I ,do think -t6'iialmid is caable of making' th distinction between what took place here and the firm as a whole.\" Across the broad range of Salo- mon's clients, says Mr Maughan, there have been few defections. The firm is planning for a dip in earning power, but it has been having a good quarter, due partly to revenues for deals initiated before the scandal. Although the staff is nervous, he says, they are also responding to the new climate of managerial open-ness. \"People sense that this is a real test of character, that we can wilt, can deny, or we can accept and take responsibility and move forward. I think we're coming through it better than we deserve, in some ways.\"",

The group expects spending on construction in the former Ger- man Democratic Republic to rise rapidly over the next five years. It announced yesterday that it was purchasing clay reserves at Narsdor, near Leipzig where it plans to build its first clay roof tile factory in eastern Germany. It last year acquired four out of the five former state-owned con- crete roof tile plants. The terri- tory accounts for the largest slice of the latest investment package. The DM90m (E30m) being spent there Includes the purchase of a brickworks at Narsdorf by Braas, Germany's biggest tile producer, which is 51 per cent owned by Redland. Mr Robert Napier, chief execu- tive of Redland, said Braas had also purchased a German chim- ney contractors, Sud-West Kamln. Other purchases announced yesterday include: three concrete plants in California bought from Marley, another British building materials ro ; two roof tile plants in F a acquired from Gory, a US roup; a sand gravel and pavinglsess acquired in Denver, Colorado and two ready- mixed concrete plants in New Mexico purchased from Pioneer, an Australian group. Mr Napier, who recently returned from a visit to eastern Germany, said: \"Minor public works are taking place in the main streets of almost every town you drive through. Roads are starting to be repaired. There is also a lot of patching and mendlng of housing although not a lot of naew building.\"",

   "text_content" : "By WNlHm Cochradw EAGLE STAR., the UK insurance subsidiary of the tobacco-based BAT Industries ou, has received a writ hom Danque Bruxelles Lambert BL Belgium's second larg- est bank, In connection witha the property mortgage indem- nity business which has run the insurer into serious prob- lems over the past two years. Mortgage Indemnity policies protect bulding societies and other lenders against losses incurred because of defaults by lborrowers. BAT confirmed yes- terday that a writ had been issued, and said that it was received two months ago. A spokesman said that the action concerned commercial prop- erty business, losses on which were mostly provided for in the Eagle Star accounts for 1990. . The action centres mostly on the value of London office properties, the supply of which has soared since mid-1989, and the take-up of which has col- lapsed since the beginning of 1990. Eagle Star, it said, had thought that there had been material non-disclosure of the value of certain commercial properties, of which BBL had mostly financed the top slice and insured this portion with the company. There were reports over the weekend that the property con- cerned was valued at over Â£300m. The BAT spokesman said that Eagle Star had been attempting to negotiate with BBL on precisely this point, and that accordingly it could neither confirm nor deny the figure. BAT did say that top-slice business usually related to 15 per cent of the value of a prop- erty with a 90 per cent mort- gage, leaving the developer to bear the risk on the first 75 per cent; and that sometimes the borrowing related to 100 per cent of the value, leaving the insurer with a 25 per cent expo. sure. In one or two cases, said the spokesman, BAT had insured all of the borrowing, on what was described as a \"ground-up\" basis; but he could not say whether any of the BBL policies were on this basis. Just over two weeks ago, Eagle Star brought forward the publication of its 1991 interim report and disclosed a Â£189m loss for the first six months of this year against a Â£21m profit for the same period of 1990. This time, underwriting losses of Â£121m on domestic mortgage indemnity policies were mainly to blame. Eagle Star's book of commer- cial and residential property insurance was discontinued last year. By that time it had generated a loss of more than Â£200m, and further losses have been provided for this year.",

   "text_content" : "AGB Research, the international market research group which is part of the pri- vate Robert Maxwell Group, is losing a top layer of manage- ment as part of cost-cutting programme. Mr Mark Booth is giving up his job as chief executive, though it is believed discus- sions are continuing about another role for him within the Maxwell group of companies. Mr Kevin Maxwell is to become chief executive, although AGB is likely to be run on a daily basis by Mr Chris Collins, at present man- aging director of AGB (UK). Executives leaving the com- pany are believed to include: Mr Dan Holdsworth, chief exec- utive for Europe, Australia and New Zealand; Mr Dean Eisner, deputy managing director of AGB (UK); Mr Mark Gressle, director of Value Strategy Compensation; and Mr Peter Beverley, international busi- ness development director. Venture Plant in acquisition talks Following recent press specula- tion, the board of Venture Plant Group, the hirer of con- struction machinery and equip- ment, has announced that the company is in talks concerning the possible acquisition of a new business. The prospective purchase is in conjunction with a capital raising exercise and the intro- duction of new management to the company. Ecclesiastical Ins Office in red Ecclesiastical Insurance Office suffered a pre-tax loss of Â£2.16m in the first half of 1991, against profits of Â£2.97m in the half year to August 31 1990. After an extraordinary credit of Â£3.51m there was an attrib- utable profit of Â£920,000, against Â£1.97m. Turnover increased to Â£53.8m (Â£47.7m). The company is ultimately owned by All- churches Trust. Storehouse chief takes sick leave Mr Michael Julien, the chief executive of the Storehouse retailing group, is taking six weeks off work to recover from a viral infection. But the company denied press speculation that Mr Julien was intending to leave the company for good saying he would be back in the office in November. In the absence of the chief executive, Mr Ian Hay David- son, chairman, and Mr David Simons, the recently-appointed finance director, will assume a more active role in the day-to-day running of the company. Servomex declines to Â£922,000 Servomex, the manufacturer of gas analysers and instrumenta- tion systems, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Â£1.04m to Â£922,000 in the first half of 1991, though the result exceeded the Â£903,000 the company made in the second half of 1990. Turnover advanced 5 per cent to Â£8.54m (Â£8.14m). Mr John Burton, chairman, said that orders received were almost 16 per cent ahead, mostly as a result of the Drax power station letter of intent, worth Â£910,000. Operating profits came out at Â£1.09m (Â£1.15m) and interest payable rose to Â£165,000 (Â£117,000). Earnings were reduced to 6p (6.7p), but the interim dividend is again 1.8p. BZW Convertible net assets rise BZW Convertible Investment Trust raised net asset value by 3 per cent from 94.34p to 97.15p in the year ended July 31 1991. Earnings per share were 8.8p (4.47p for period from February 8 to July 31 1990) and the final quarter's dividend of 3.2p makes a total of 7.7p (3.8p), exceeding the 7.5p forecast at the time of the company's launch. Net revenue amounted to Â£4.45m (Â£2.26m).",

   "text_content" : "mv Jon Thoihill SELECT APPOINTMENTS, the employment agency, Is trying to stave off financial collapse by proposing a 7.5m relnanc- in whichwould result in existing shareholders retaining only 10 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the company. The USM-quoted Select, which announced pre-tax losses of Â£2.38m (Â£241,000) for the year ended April 5 1991, has seen its financial position deteriorate since that date because of problems with an overseas subsidiary and its high levels of debt. Two weeks ago Select's bank borrowings amounted to Â£6.8m and it owed the tax authorities a further Â£1.8m. A fresh inflow of funds was now \"absolutely essential\" if Select was to avoid being wound up, the company said. Select is proposing that Waverly Investments - a new- ly-created company owned by two former directors of the Adia personnel services group should subscribe for 90 per cent of the shares in an enlarged company for Â£2.5m. Waverly would also provide 2.5m for the company's work- ing capital requirements and would spend a further Â£2.5m in paying down Select's bank debt with Barclays Bank - which is currently owed approximately Â£6.4m. Waverly's two directors, Mr Martin Pestalozzi and Mr Rod- erick Macleod, will help develop Select's existing busi- ness but do not intend to become directors of the com- pany. Select also announced it has sold its US operations and its Australasian Morgan & Banks business. The company will pay Barclays Bank Elm from the proceeds of the sale of Mor- gan & Banks. Following the restructuring, Select will run 31 offices in the UK, six offices in Australia and two in New Zealand. The refi- nancing is subject to share- holder approval. Select's sales in the year to April 5 fell from Â£69.57m to Â£53.76m. Operating profits dropped sharply from Â£3.38m to Â£816,000 and Interest took an increased Â£1.24m (Â£741,000). An exceptional charge of Â£1.95m (Â£2.88m) was also taken, relat- ing to reorganisation, redun- dancy and depreciation costs. Losses per share amounted to 12p (f19p) and there was no dividend (1.2p)."

   "text_content" : "By Katarine Campbell in Frankfurt GERMANY'S seven regional exchanges have agreed in prin- cipal to participate in Frank- furt's electronic trading sys- tem, Ibis 11, in a further small step to draw together the coun- try's fragmented stock exchanges. Mr Dieter Milhausen, board member of the Frankfurt bourse, said yesterday that he expected around 30 new partic- ipants - independent and offi- cial brokers as well as small and medium-sized banks - to join Ibis 11 as a result of the decision, which still has to be formally approved by the boards of the regional markets. Ibis has around 95 partici- pants. In spite of its relative primitiveness, the screen-based system listing the PAX 30 blue chip stocks and some heavily traded domestic bonds has attracted an increasing propor- tion of volume in Frankfurt since it was introduced in April. In August, 13 per cent of DAX turnover was routed through Ibis. At the same time, spreads between bid and offer prices have narrowed to between 50 pfennigs and DM1. The new agreement, drawn up by Mr Wolfgang Peterhoff, chief executive of the Dissel- dorf stock exchange, assures that members of any one of the regional bourses can trade on Ibis without completing the cumbersome process of joining Frankfurt. While almost all the leading banks are members of Ger- many's biggest exchange, many smaller institutions, as well as the liquidity-generating brokers, are not. The official brokers, who on Ibis lose their privilege of levying fixed com- missions, can still use the sys- tem - which, unlike the physi- cal trading floors, is open continuously between 8.30am and 5.00pm - for establishing or liquidating their own posi- tions. Control of the system, how- ever, remains entirely with the privatised Frankfurt stock exchange, which has spent DM16m ($9.10m) building Ibis. The regions will also cede reg- ulatory authority (for screen trading) to the Frankfurt exchange.",

   "article_dc_title" : "French Bourse Heads for Second Wave of Reforms",
   "text_content" : "By William Dwk in Paris A STEP has been taken towards what is expected to become a second wave of French stock excha reform,nn with an agreement bIugula tors to encourage stockbrokers to improve their financial secu- rity. From next January, the Con- seil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) will issue separate licences for different aspects of stockbroklag activity, such as share trading and back ofice execution. Separate rules are also being planned for brokers offering custody of clients' shares, said the CBV. So-called segmentation of functions is one of the main points in a package of reform proposals presented last July by a group of independent experts led by Mr Rend de la Serre, managing director of Crddit Commercial de France, the privatised bank. Many leading brokers have already started to put their dif- ferent functions into separate subsidiaries to reassure clients made anxious by last year's spectacular collapse of Turfer et Associds, under investiga- Ren6 de la Sem: presented reform package in July tion for allegedly using clients' money to cover losses. The move will now allow them to register their various functions with the CBV, under capital requirements and codes of conduct to be defined by the end of the year. If they wish, brokers can continue to regis- ter themselves as before, with their various functions in one company. The finance ministry yester-. day welcomed the move. The first round of reforms allowed outside investors to buy into broken for the first time three years ago, fallowed by stricter takeover rules and a clampdown on insider dealing, and - fom next January - an end to brokers' monopoly of stock exchange seats. The ministry is considering the other proposals in Mr dela Serre's report, which aims to stem the steady flow of stock exchange business to London which has taken place in spite of the earlier reforms. It calls for the abolition of a tax on share trading turnover - which is unlikely to please the cash-strapped government - and for the development of trading in large blocks of shares between big institu- tional shareholders off the main market, as in the UK. Block trading has been allowed in France for the past three years, but only for matched bargains, with the result that the growth of the block market has disappointed professionals.",

   "text_content" : "By Wlliam Dawklns THE FRENCH government plans to make up its mind by the end of the year whether to respond to pressure from stock market professionals to make it easier for big investors to trade shares outside the regu- lar market. It is awaiting the results of a study group set up by the Con- sell des Bourse de Valeurs (CBV), the stock exchange reg- ulator, due to report in mid-No- vember on how the Paris mar- ket can attract the lucrative business of so-called block trading in French shares, a large part of which takes place in London where conditions are more flexible. The rethink implies that the government might wish to reassess its tough stance on the European Community's investment services directive, which has for long been blocked over disagreements on the future organisation of Europe's investment markets. \"You are right to make the connection with the invest- ment services directive,\" said a finance ministry official. One of the main points at issue in the directive is whether all securities trading should take place on a single regulated market, as sought by France, Spain and Italy, on the grounds that investors need full protection. Britain, Ger- many and the Netherlands, who want to foster trading out- side the regular markets, sus- pect that France and others fear competition. The ministry recognises the importance of block trading, but believes some kind of regu- lation is needed so that this does not \"absorb\" the regular stock market, explained the official. For the past three years, France has allowed big institu- tions to trade with each other off the market only on a matched bargain basis, so they have tended to take such busi- ness to less regulated markets like London's Seaq Interna- tional. This is in contrast with Britain's quote-driven system, where a broker can buy part of a block of shares and then par- cel it out to clients. This latest rethink was trig- gered by a report in July from a panel calling for a series of other reforms but only touch- ing briefly on block trading. The CBV then asked Mr Fran- cois Bacot, of the stockbrokers Bacot Allain, to lead a working party to report in more detail."

   "text_content" : "By Barbara Durr in Chicago US OPTIONS exchanges are preparing to launch a flock of new options next month when more relaxed rules on options listings become effective. But the new listings are being care- fully selected because of cost concerns. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the new rules, which were originally proposed in 1986, last week. These entail a series of changes in the eligibility stan- dards for listing options. The changes include elimi- nating the requirement that a company earn at least Sim dur- ing the previous eight quarters before an option can be listed on its securities; allowing shares that trade as low as $7.50, instead of the old limit of $10; and lowering the required number of shareholders in a company to 2,000 from 6,000. Also, the prohibition on list- ing options for companies that have defaulted on debt pay- ments in the previous 12 months has been removed. As a result of the SEC rule changes, the Chicago Board Options Exchange announced it will launch 21 new stock options on October 21. That number is down from the 3s options originally planned because member firms are wor- ried about costs. Cost concerns arise from a drop in the CBOE's trading vol- ume, which means reduced revenues. The fall in volume prompted redundancies last week in the exchange staff. The American Stock Exchange, also under pressure from member firms on costs, is cutting its current list of 31 new options set for the October 21 launch. Member firms are concerned that exchanges pick the most viable options. The CBOE has also been forced to delist five more of its low-volume options, having already dropped eight earlier this year. Options on BAT Industries are among the latest five to be axed. * BCE, the holding company for Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, has sold its remain- ing stockholding in Quebecor, the Montreal publishing and commercial printing group, for C$36.5m (8832m), writes ob- ert Gibbes= In Montreal. BCE had about 20 per cent of Quebecor's B shares as a result of selling its own commercial printing business to Quebecor in 198. It sold half this holding last April, and is now pulling out of commercial printing to concen- trate on cor tlecommunica- tions businesses. Quebecor is North America's second largest commercial printer and also owns pulp and paper interests in partnership with British publisher Mr Rob- ert Maxwell",

   "text_content" : "EXPECTATIONS of a ftrther easing in inflationary condi- tions in the UK later this year underpinned the gilt market, which showed a healthy rise in prices. Continuing the rally in the market which began early in July, yields fell for nearly all classes of UK government bonds. A particularly sharp fall at the short end of the yield curve was accounted for by last week's unexpected reduc- tion in interest rates, from 11 per cent to 10% per cent. With two opinion polls point- ing to a lead by the Conserva- tive party over Labour, the gilt rally was also helped by per- ceptions that the government might win an early election. Attention this week will focus on the degree to which the bullish comments from ministers about the inflation profile can be supported by data on the pace of the UK economic recovery and the extent of reductions in the rate of price rises. Today the Central Statistical Office announces the amount of new consumer credit in July advanced from building societ- ies, finance houses and on bank cards. The figure has been extremely low in recent months, and the latest figure is likely to show a rile to about Â£15m - althoug that figure will be nothing lke enouh to convince commentators of a start of a meaningful repovery in confidence. That, in itself, will be good news for gilt investors, who want to see a slow, measured recovery rather than a sharp one as this holds out the best chance that inflationary pres- sures will fail to be reignited. There will be more interest in figures on Thursday, which are expected to show that the annual rate of rise in underly- ing earnings across the econ- omy, 8% per cent in June, con- tinued its fall of the past six months and dropped to 8 per cent in July. Also the annual rate of rise in the retail prices index, 5.5 per cent in July, is widely anticipated to have come down by a full percentage point in August, a figure due on Friday. Although many expect the rate of rise in retail prices to fall to 4 per cent or less by the end of the year, there was some nervousness in sections of the gilt market about the degree to which the govern- ment's recent surge in popular- ity was likely to continue. One view was that with Mr John Major's face appearing on SuIx: WAbarg BSriNM TV screens virtually every day during late August due to the crisis in the USSR, the govern- ment would have to be doing very badly in policy matters generally for it not to show up well in opinion polls. \"The real test will come later in the year when people's minds come back to the econ- omy and the pace of any recov- ery,\" said one commentator. One shade of opinion among gilt practitioners is that, should a Labour government win power, an extremely heavy programme of bond issues would follow to finance a large public spending programme. That would be expected to depress prices and might be another reason why the gilt market and the City in general -which traditionaly finds it difficult to become enthused about Labour governments - would favour the re-election of the Conservatives. However, if the evidence of recent weeks is anything to go by, gilt practitioners are becoming much more relaxed about the prospect of a large volume of Issues this financial year - when some Â£12bn-l15bn of new gilts are likely to find their way on to the market. So far, just over Â£8bn of gilts have been announced, and on Friday the Bank of England announced a new gilt auction, the third this year, when Â£lbn-42bn of bonds will proba- bly be put up for sale. The announcement of the auction - set for September 25 and involving gilts maturing between 2003 and 2009 - barely disturbed the generally sunny mood of the market. There was certainly little incli- nation to mark down prices. The details of the specific stock and the amount to be auc- tioned will be announced on September 17. Peter Marsh",

   "text_content" : "JAPANESE government bonds, recovering from July's dol- drums, have posted sharp ral- lies during the past few weeks, helped along by a slew of eco- nomic figures confirming the slowing trend in the economy and easing inflation. Last week a sharp fall in short-term interest rates fol- lowing fund injections by the central bank added to the excitement, prompting specula- tion of an imminent cut for the discount rate. The yield on the unsecured overnight call rate closed at 7.19 per cent, falling 34 basis points from the previous week, and the yield on the No.129 10- year benchmark bond closed at 6.27 per cent last Friday, down 32 basis points from 6.59 per cent at the beginning of August. Economic data released in mid-August had been favoura- ble. July wholesale prices, which reinforced expectations of a fall in inflation, rose by 1.7 per cent, significantly slower than the 2.1 per cent of June. And further evidence of eco- nomic slowdown came from the 2.7 per cent decline in June private sector machinery orders and a 9.7 per cent year- on-year increase in business inventories. The central bank's interven- tion in the money market, ahead of last Friday's release of the Bank of Japan quarterly survey of business sentiment release could suggest that the economy is in a far more par- lous condition than most bond market participants had sus- pected. Indeed the survey later showed that business confi- dence fell to the lowest level for more than three years, with the business confidence index for leading manufacturing companies down to 27 from 36 in May. Imminent releases of interim business results and economic indicators should provide fur- ther evidence of a slowing economy. While this could be good news for the bond mar- ket, the BOJ, after the release of the survey, commented that although economic growth was decelerating, a sharp decline would be unlikely. However, the slowdown in Japan's growth is still marked in contrast with other leading economies. For the current sis- cal year ending March next, the Economic Planning Agency is forecasting 3.8 per cent growth, down from 5.6 in fiscal 1990. It may be hard for bond mar- kets to sustain last week's rally. Profit taking and unload- ing of long positions were seen at the end of last week after the central bank's unexpected confident tone suggested that an imminent discount rate cut would be unlikely. Analysts expect that for the time being, the BOJ will con- tinue to control monetary pol- icy by influencing money mar- ket rates rather than by cutting the discount rate. Meanwhile, the absence of institutional activity will also make a further bond market rally difficult to realise. Recent trading has been dealer-led, as institutional investors remain nervous of the sharp rise in bond prices. Volumes are lower than that of the last rally in February, with trading in the No.129 bond remaining at Y15,600bn in August compared to Febru- ary's Y18,600bn. \"Prices have become too high for investors to join in at this point,\" says a life insurance company official. In addition, given the high demand in long-term funds of the corporate sector, long-term interest rates may have little room for a further fall. Emiko Terazono",

   "text_content" : "TODAY Is \"Rosh Hashanah\", and traders in the US bond markets would love to cele- brate the first week of the Jew- ish New Year with a discount rate cut and long yields below 8 per cent. Judging by the way markets behaved late last week (prices rose sharply across the matu- rity spectrum on Friday, buoyed by heavy retail demand), traders and investors in Treasuries remain confident that the Federal Reserve will soon ease monetary policy. Their confidence has held firm in spite of factory orders, lead- ing indicators, employment and money supply figures released last week which all pointed to an improvement in the rate of economic recovery. Although last Friday's 34,000 rise in August non-farm pay- rolls and the hefty one-week $6.4bn rise in M2, the broadest and most reliable measure of money, will have made Fed officials feel better, the prog- ress of the economy in its jour- ney out of recession remains unsteady and laborious. It has been the sluggish pace of the recovery that has per- suaded so many bond investors and dealers to bet on a dis- count rate cut. Because infla- tion is no longer the threat it once was, the market believes the Fed has ample room to loosen the monetary reins. The inflationary picture in the US remains almost unre- servedly bright.

Money supply: In the week ended August 26. Ml rose by $5.3bn to $869.9bn. prices over the years, it should not have escaped the Fed's attention that the current year- on-year rate of core US con- sumer price inflation, at 4.8 per cent, is edging closer and closer to the German level of 4.4 per cent. If inflation is measured over a shorter time-scale, the results are even more impressive. The rate of consumer price rises since the start of this year stands at 2.7 per cent, and the rate of consumer inflation in the past six months at 2.2 per cent. These shorter-term figures provide a better indication of actual price patterns in the economy as they are unaf- fected by last autumn's data, which was severely disrupted by the effect of the Gulf crisis on world oil markets. Stable world oil prices, poor domestic consumer demand which has deflated service sec- tor prices, and the slowdown in the rise of labour costs in the wake of higher unemployment, have all contributed to an improved inflationary climate. However, if the Fed wants one last look at the inflation numbers before taking the plunge on interest rates, it need wait no further than this Thursday and Friday's pro- ducer and consumer price fig- ures. Analysts are expecting both sets of data to show only small monthly changes, and fore. casts that headline consumer inflation will drop to between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent by the end of the year remain on course. This Friday also sees the publication of the August retail sales statistics. The weakness in the US consumer sector remains a big worry for the Fed and one of the most persuasive reasons for lower- ing interest rates. Yet, the market's confidence that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates could prove mis- placed. Last week two senior Fed members - both members of the key policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee - publicly aired their views on the economic outlook, and their comments would not have given much comfort to those hoping for a policy ease. Mr John Laware, a Fed gov- ernor, predicted GNP growth of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in the second half of this year, and although he said that the Fed was evenly poised to shift policy in either direction, his optimistic views on the economy suggested he person- ally favours keeping policy unchanged. Similar thoughts were expressed by Mr Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve bank of San Francisco, who warned that with the economy at a turning point the authorities should not lose sight of their longer-term goal of controlling, and ultimately eliminating, inflation. As always, the Fed's caution over cutting rates has not gone down well in the political world. Mr Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser at the White House, emphasised that healthy monetary growth will be a crucial ingredient in the economic recovery. Mr Boskin said that concerns about infla- tion should not prevent the Fed from taking the necessary steps to stimulate money growth. Patrick Harverson",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL Insurance, the UK life and general insurer, is prepar- ing to tap the syndicated loan market at the culmination of what has been one of the worst reporting seasons ever for the UK insurance industry. Royal itself, which lost Â£97m in the first half of the year, capped a miserable year so far with news at the end of last week of 600 redundancies. All of which may help to explain the pricing of Royal's Â£250m standby credit facility being arranged by Barclays Bank. The three-year deal replaces an expiring Â£250m, three-year standby credit used to back the company's com- mercial paper programme. Royal's facility is being offered at 55 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (libor) - a rate seen as generous by bankers who have been approached about the deal. The commitment fee of 27.5 basis points over libor is similarly generously priced. According to one banker, the pricing reflects a desire to rein- force Royal's position with its relationship banks, although Barclays refused to comment on the deal at the end of last week. The price could also reflect the likelihood that the facility in part will be drawn down, rather than remain only as a standby. With UK insurers going through hard times, the commercial paper market is not always hungry for their paper, leaving it to banks to meet short-term financing needs (indeed, Royal's existing facility has been part-utilised).

The problem for banks in the meantime is assessing the likely use to which the facility will be put. Royal will be hoping that Barclays can do as well on sell- ing its deal as the bank, work- ing with National Westminster, did for Racal Electronics. A $250m term loan brought a month ago for Racal has now been raised to $350m thanks to demand (even at that level, says Barclays, it has had to scale back banks' involve- ment). Racal's 18-month deal, at 75 basis points over libor, is to provide working capital during the transitional period after the demerger of Racal, which will see Racal Telecom (which operates the Vodafone cellular phone network) split off from the rest of the group. * News that Philip Morris is in the market for finance is always guaranteed to send a flutter through the hearts of rival chief executives. There is hardly a takeover rumour in the food and drinks business without the giant US corpora- tion's name being linked in some way. When Philip Morris is looking for $15bn, then those flutters turn quickly to mas- sive palpitations. News of the latest massive financing leaked out at the end of last week. Few details are available, except that the deal is being put together in New York by Citibank. The scale of the transaction does not mean that Philip Mor- ris is preparing a bid. Other bankers who have got wind of the deal say that it is being talked of as a refinancing, in part to refinance the Kraft acquisition. However, that will not necessarily calm every- one's nerves: $15bn, after all, is a lot of cash to be asking for from banks. Given Philip Morris's strong name and the fact that, with or without a capital crunch, bank- ers still have lending targets to meet, there was a general belief at the end of last week that the company should have little problem raising the money from its existing rela- tionship banks - always assuming, of course, that the deal is fairly priced.

   "article_dc_title" : "Sterling's Stability Poses a Dilemma for Treasurers",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "STERLING'S stubborn stability within the European exchange rate mechanism poses a dilemma for UK company trea- surers. On the one hand it has buoyed overseas demand for sterling bonds to record levels; on the other it supplies a com- pelling argument for not bor- rowing now. There was another spree of sterling bond issues in the international bond market last week, but not from UK compa- nies. A further Â£500m was issued, underlining that demand for sterling-denomi- nated paper has not slackened after the summer break. According to syndicate man- agers, around 60 or 70 per cent of last week's new issues went abroad, mainly to institutional and retail investors in conti- nental Europe. This consistent buying of Eurosterling paper, and equally strong appetite for UK government bonds, is attri- buted to the UK currency's sta- ble membership of the ERM. There were initial doubts about the durability of sterling's DM2.95 central rate against the D-Mark. Salomon Brothers reckoned last winter that a rate of DM2.20 might be more appropriate over 10 years. But the climate of opinion has changed. In recent months few analysts have suggested that a devaluation of sterling within the ERM is necessary. A National Institute for Eco- nomic and Social Research review published two weeks ago stood out in questioning current parities. International investors also appear confident. The latest Merrill Lynch survey of insti- tutional portfolio managers found only 11 per cent of respondents felt they were overweight in sterling assets. Yet 61 per cent felt under- weight to some extent in ster- ling. One third of these felt heavily underweight. Overseas buying has nar- rowed secondary market yield spreads, especially for top- rated borrowers. The European Investment Bank last week launched a new issue at a yield spread of just 23 basis points over UK gilts - the lowest yield spread on a new Eurosterling issue for 2'/ years. Corporate yield spreads have also narrowed. However, corporate treasur- ers who believe that the cur- rent position in the ERM is sustainable will also believe that UK interest rates will con- verge with those of the low-inflation European coun- tries. Convergence offers one good reason not to lock into long-term funding at current interest rates. Why borrow at 11 per cent over 10 or 20 years when interest rates may be as low as 7 or 8 per cent in two or three years' time? In addition, corporate bor- rowing statistics suggest that demand for debt finance is for the moment very low on cycli- cal grounds. First-quarter cor- porate borrowing of Â£6bn was the lowest since 1987. Borrow- ing from banks was just Â£1.2bn, the lowest since 1986. In the second quarter the trend continued, with a net debt repayment by companies to banks of 3.5bn. Third-quar- ter figures, due out at the end of this month, will make inter- esting reading. The UK corporate sector cer- tainly has the capacity to bor- row if an upturn in the econ- omy comes. Nomura Research Institute estimated at the end of last year that UK companies could increase their borrow- ings by Â£20bn and still retain an aggregate gearing ratio below that of 1962. Since that forecast was made there have been plenty of rights issues and precious few debt issues. Last week's % point cut in base rates to 10%'/ per cent will bring corporate funding targets closer to being achieved. Bond syndicate managers will be arguing for action now, rather than delaying until the next interest rate cut. They will recall the mistakes made last time around the economic cycle when many waited too long for the trough in interest rates, only to see rates spiral back up to 15 per cent. This argument may fall on deaf ears. Those with faith in the ERM will reply that this cycle is different from previous cycles. In theory, ERM disci- pline will ensure basically sta- ble or falling interest rates, so long as the currency remains stable. And stable it certainly is: sterling ended the week just above DM2.94, a shade higher than at the start of the week, despite another cut in interest rates. Simon London",

Looking ahead to possible interest rate moving events it is hard to see the authorities sanctioning another cut before the start of the Conservative Party conference in early October. The most obvious date appears to be October 11, when Mr John Major, the prime minister, addresses party members and the September retail prices index is published. According to Union Discount Friday's headline inflation rate for August is likely to fall to 4.8 from 5.5 per cent. The September figure, published during the conference, is forecast at 4.3 per cent, with the low in the present cycle coming in October at 3.5 per cent. This figure is expected on November 15. Such statistics will provide food for thought for anyone considering a November general election. CURMENCY MOVEMENTS S ad of Maorgin S .....ng .......... 910 -20.5 U.S ............... 663 -1.

This was her private secretary, Charles Powell (since knighted in her resigna- tion honours). Like his predecessors serv- ing her and earlier British prime ministers, Sir Charles was a career diplomat, pro- pelled into the job by the mys- terious but well-oiled machin- ery of the Foreign Office personnel department. But whereas previous incumbents had moved on after a two-year stint, Sir Charles stayed. It was no secret that Mrs Thatcher was reluctant to let him go. As the years went by he achieved an almost legendary reputation as an eminence grise. Some of his former col- leagues could be heard grum- bling that, instead of helping to bring the prime minister round to Foreign Office views, he had become \"more Thatcherite than Thatcher\". He was cred- ited, especially, with author- ship of the 1988 Bruges speech which, against Foreign Office advice, sharpened the contrast between her vision of a Europe based on sovereign nation- states and the federalist rheto- ric preferred by most of her EC partners. As a civil servant, Sir Charles's own lips were sealed. But three weeks ago he joined the private sector, becoming a director of Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based trading group, and as such free to speak his mind on public affairs. His response to the charges listed above is, in essence, \"guilty and proud of it\". He did not quite agree with my description of him as \"the foreign office man who went native at Number 10\", but only because he had already been a strong admirer of Mrs Thatcher long before he went there. Today that admiration is even stronger. It would be hard, he says, \"to think of any earlier British prime minister that has played such a role\". Indeed, without her influence over Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, during his first years as Soviet leader, \"the world would have been worse off\". Sir Charles believes Mrs Thatcher played an important part in Mr Gorbachev's think- ing \"at a very early stage\", par- ticularly by encouraging him to develop the concept of \"devolution of power\", and to pursue a co-operative relation- ship with the US, putting his trust in President Ronald Rea- gan. She was, he says, \"a bit of a stalking horse\" for the US president, but this was a useful and beneficial role to play, since \"she could express what Mr Reagan thought so much better than he could himself\". Sir Charles also identifies strongly with Mrs Thatcher's policy towards South Africa, especially her refusal to adopt sanctions in spite of pressure from the Commonwealth. \"She was absolutely right. What has the Commonwealth contrib- uted to South Africa? Ab-so- lute-ly NOTHING.\" (At this point he even begins to sound a bit like his heroine.) He sees her as someone unencumbered with \"a world view\" but guided by \"strong principles\" and a \"strong belief in following Britain's national self-inter- est\". Did she, I asked, ever con- sider the possibility that her principles might conflict with British interests? \"I don't think,\" Sir Charles replied, \"it was something that kept her awake at night. I don't think principles were a guide to action on a day-to-day basis. They were the sort of back- ground to your foreign policy.\" Sir Charles is unafflicted by false modesty about his own role at Number 10: \"Of course you are, or you should be, only an adjunct of the prime minis- ter. But quite honestly, the way modern government works, the way which increas- ingly foreign affairs works, I don't think it's reasonable to expect someone to be Just a sort of little robot working as a civil servant in Number 10, especially if you stay longer than the prescribed two years.\" He agrees that the difference between himself and his for- mer colleagues was sharpest on Europe. \"My own approach to Europe was very much artic- ulated in the Bruges speech, which is not surprising because I wrote it... rm just less internationalist than they are. Im not saying they're all like that. But although I had very happy times there I never felt entirely comfortable.\" He does, however, defend his colleagues against the accusa- tion of disloyalty. I asked whether on this point he thought Mrs Thatcher would agree with him. \"I think there's something very deep there. It goes back a long way with her... She grew up in the company of a part of He became 'more Thatcherite than Thatcher' the Conservative party which saw the Foreign Office as an instrument for giving away British interests and power, and she brought that attitude with her into opposition and to some extent into her time as prime minister, though I don't think it was anything like as strong by then. And she had this curious ability to distin- guish between the Foreign Office, of which I think she remained suspicious to the PERSONAL FILE 1941 Born Haywards Heath, Sussex.

She got on extremely well with them, and had a good eye, I think, for selecting and promoting the best of them.\" Similarly, he recalls, \"she drew a distinction between the Foreign Office and our embas- sies abroad... She never wanted Foreign Office officials to accompany her on visits abroad. she didn't need a dele- gation, she knew what she was going to say. But our ambassa- \"or was our representative on the spot, and she thought that he should be seen sitting on the right hand of God, as it were.\" Sir Charles claims he was not conscious of any personal hostility from Foreign Office colleagues \"except in one or two isolated cases\". But he does believe there was \"a resentment that a degree of say in foreign affairs had been taken away to Number 10, more probably than had hap- pened since Churchill's time\". That, he thinks, was inevitable when the prime minister had served so long. \"When you've been around for nearly 12 years as prime minister you just know the issues better than most For- eign Office officials who've been dealing with it for two or three years. You know the peo- ple better, can better judge their reactions.\" This prime ministerial lon- gevity seems to merge in Sir Charles's mind with his own role and his network of con- tacts with opposite numbers in Paris, Bonn and Washington - contacts which, he thinks, proved valuable during the Gulf war when he stayed on to assure continuity in the first months of Mr John Major's government. Sir Charles is anxious to stress his admiration for Mr Major, whom he describes as \"very determined, very shrewd\". He even accords him one virtue which Mrs Thatcher lacked: \"he's got that intensely political approach\". Sir Charles claims to have told Mrs Thatcher to her face that she \"did sometimes neglect the political dimension, she was too much concerned with the substance and not enough with the politics\". He also admires Mr Douglas Hurd, whom he regards as \"probably the best foreign sec- retary we've had since the war\". But the best he can find to say about Mr Hurd's prede- cessor Sir Geoffrey Howe is that he was \"an extremely good negotiator, a master of detail\". Much of the \"dishar- mony\" between Number 10 and the Foreign Office he attri- butes to the \"increasing dis- tance\" between Mrs Thatcher and Sir Geoffey, and he claims that many of the problems dis- appeared after she removed Sir Geoffrey from the Foreign Office in 199. He contests strongly the idea that on Europe Sir Geoffrey and the Foreign Office eventu- ally won the day. \"You can't tell that yet. You'll have to wait and see what comes out of the European Council in December, and possibly longer than that.\" There is, he insists, \"much greater continuity than is often recognised between Mr Major's policies and Mrs Thatcher's on Europe\". Mr Major, Sir Charles thinks, \"is steering things in a way that will probably make it pos- sible for us to win, in the sense that we don't see Europe going ahead as a fully-fledged federal polity, a fully-fledged economic and monetary union that a lot of people in Europe would like to see. And if we don't do that, then it will be a victory for Mrs Thatcher, Mr Major, Mr Hurd, and others.\""

   "text_content" : "he disintegration of the Soviet Union is ringing alarm bells over the future of its nuclear arsenal. Soviet and republican politi- cians have assured the world that there is no danger. But the uncertain credibility of those assurances has been exposed by the news over the weekend that the US and the Soviet Union are now talking about a new phase of negotia- tions on short-range nuclear weapons. The US is saying that the changes in Europe have reduced the military require- ment for these weapons. But the real reason is that east- west negotiation may be the only way to guarantee that the disintegration of the Soviet Union does not lead to a descent into hell The disintegration is now taking place relativly camly. But we have already seen enough inter4thnic violence to know that it could recur. And the nearcertainty of economic collapse makes a recurrence quite ky. Before there is a further deterioration in the political situation in the Soviet Union, the world has a vital interest in seeking new gIarantees that such conflict could not \"go nuclear\". This is a probem for which the west can ier some help. What is requiraed is an impe- tia *rIaeet to r Iae an unbridgeable firebreak between poical c aL -d nuclear weaponry. Such an arrangement is only possible as part of an ternational treatly, iB d with Ner- The dbelateo of sl ca ries oft d ea r W cOrM be moat vmfaaie to iuse is pObly the ae wa I on Europe in which such firebreak could be establihed. Western experts ae not pri- wmaril worred about the con- trol of lon-ranae strateic m siles, because these large systems re rigorously con- trolled from the centre and their technical safeguards against unauthodsed use are massively redundant.

There is no point in seeking poltical guarantees fom exist- ing political autorities, since noone knows how long they will survive; if there is a dan- ger, it is fom unauthorised use or accident. And there is not much point trying to pick and choose if we want to rule out this danger, we must elimi- nate all short-range and tacti- cal nuclear weapons. Moreover, if we want the Soviets to get rid of all their shortange weapons, we shll have to get rid of all ours. In other words, we must think of a treaty eliminating al these weapon in the west as we as the east. A successful prce- dent exists in the 1 USSo- viet Intermediate-range Nucear Force treaty, which eliminated all intermediate- nge Burwelsbes.

Moreover, the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty will remove Soviet supremacy in the European theatre, and will thus elmi- nate that part of the western military case for tactical nuclear weapons. So it is dim- cult to argue that tactical nuclear weapons add anything men l to the deterrence povid by strategic systems. An outlaw explosion of a tac- tical nuclear weapon in the Soviet Union ma be unlikely; but if it occurel it would be ike a second Chernobyl, so its prevention would be worth paying a price for.

It is the rainy season In Ethiopia, and this year in some parts of the country the rain has come in torrents, mocking predictions of drought that many feared would lead to a repeat of the great famine of 1984-85. But the torrential rains have brought their own prob- lems, making roads impassable and preventing relief supplies reaching the needy in outlying areas of Tigray and Welo in the north, and on the fringes of the Ogaden desert in the south. Peggy Florida, representa- tive in Addis Ababa of Cana- da's official aid agency, says the main problem facinsdg the country now is what to do with these hundreds of thousands of displaced people, many of them soldiers from the defeated army of ousted dictator, Men- gistu Haile Madram. Mengistu who fled to Zim- babwe in May just days before his army collapsed, was spend- ing between 55 and 70 per cent of the national budget on the war against rebels in Eritrea in the far north, and in the prov- inces of Tigray and Welo. It was a long conflict that bank- rupted the nation, ruined its infrastructure and prevented the movement of food from surplus to deficit areas.

Fearing possible reprisals and deprived of jobs, non-Eritreans previously resi- dent in places like the Eritrean port of Assab are among those who have converged on Addis Ababa, swelling the city's pop- ulation fom 2m to nearly Sm. The new government appears overwhelmed by its problems, although it gets marks for doing its best under near impossible circumstances. Walter Stocker of the Red Cross describes the task as \"enormous\" and says the repa- triation of soldiers alone is \"equivalent practically to rein- tegrating the coalition forces in the Gulf into normal civilian life with limited resources.\" And to describe Ethiopia's resources as limited is putting it mildly.

Aid worker In Addis Ababa say they cannot be sure of ensuring adequate food sup- ples for poor .peasant farmnners In the north to keep their streagth up for the harvest due in November/December. Transport is a key Iroblem. The appalling condtion of roads in the Ethioan high- lands and lack of trucks slows food distribution. In Makalle, Chekol Kidane, an official of the Relief Society of Tigray, said his organihation had been obliged to reduce the numbers gttig a 1 per month grain =a flour ration by 40 per cent becae of supply problems. \"People are suffering the consequences of last year's drought,\" he says. \"There is not enough food to eat, and people are not strong enough to work in the fields. They are starving. You can see it in the swelling of their bodies which is a sign of malnutrition.\" Perhaps the area in most critical need is in the south near the border of Somalia - which itself has been torn apart by a bloody civil war. Aid workers estimate that some 400,000 Somalis have crossed into Ethiopia, along with large numbers of return- ing Ethiopians who had earlier taken refuge in Somalia. According to Elizabeth Stone of the Christian Relief and Development Association, an Addis-based organisation that helps co-ordinate the work of non-government agencies in Ethiopia, the \"nutritional situ- ation is dropping and drop- ping\" in the region around Dire Dawa near the northern Somali border and further south towards the Ogaden. This is partly because of the difficulty of moving food to the affected areas. Recent rains have made roads almost impassable and food that is being airlifted from the Red Sea port of Djibouti is piling up at distribution cen- tres. \"The danger,\" she says,\" is that you reach a point where you can't get people back on their feet.\" Tony Walker",

   "text_content" : "which took place in the late 1980s, Richard Lapper finds that intense competition in the US and Europe and a crowded market are adding further uncertainty to the picture As reinsurance companies reel from the unprecedented series of accidents and natural disasters AS THE world's reinsurers prepare to meet for their annual get together in Monte Carlo this week, their market appears perhaps less predict- able than ever. A combination of overcapacity and intense competition in Europe and the US and an unprecedented series of catastrophe losses has produced a complex and uneven picture. * In the proportional reinsur- ance market (where the rein- surer shares a fixed percentage of the premium and the risk with the reinsured) rates are low, reflecting the state of direct insurance markets in which overcapacity is still dampening rates. * In the specialised marine and aviation reinsurance mar- kets, which have been in the doldrums for much of the 1980s, rates are starting to rise. * In the market for individual risks (the so-called facultative market which provides reinsur- ance for large industrial risks such as chemical plants) rates are still competitive, reflecting conditions in the direct market for commercial and industrial risks in both Europe and the US. Efforts by Europe's profes- sional reinsurers to force through rate increases on sac- ultative Bdsiness'appear to have had, so far at least, little impact. * By contrast the London catastrophe market (which reinsurers refer to as the non- proportional excess of loss market) has suffered a dra- matic shrinkage of capacity. Rates have escalated dramatic- ally. This has been particularly marked in the so-called retro- cession market where catastro- phe reinsurers buy their own reinsurance cover. The market is supported by Lloyd's of Lon- don as well as many of the world's biggest reinsurance companies and has borne the brunt of the extraordinary sequence of weather and indus- trial losses at the end of the 1980s. The gap between conditions on the catastrophe market on the one hand and the propor- tional market on the other is \"probably bigger than it has ever been\", says Mr Ken Carter, chief executive of bro- kers, Lloyd Thompson. The storms of October 1987, were followed by the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion which took place in July 1988, and in the space of three months in the autumn of 1989 came Hur- ricane Hugo, the Phillips Pasa- dena refinery explosion and - the San Francisco earthquake. In London, Lloyd's syndi- cates and companies were already beginning to withdraw from the catastrophe reinsur- ance market when it was rocked by a series of storms in early 1990. \"The catastrophe market cannot cope with that kind of loss frequency,\" says Mr Ron Iles, chief executive of Alexan- der Howden Reinsurance Bro- kers. Rates hardened - to all-time highs - throughout 1990, and with capacity scarce during the last renewal season many reinsurers were unable to complete their own pro- grammes of retrocession pro- tection. This year - with the extent of catastrophe losses becoming clearer - the retrocession mar- ket has shrunk further. The crisis at Lloyd's which announced its first losses for 20 years in June has contributed to the capacity crunch. Some of the syndicates worst hit - such as the Feltrim agen- cies - were heavily exposed to catastrophe reinsurance. Although the business was written in 1988, many of the loss-making syndicates are only now closing their doors. Members' agents, who handle the affairs of Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose wealth backs underwriting at the mar- ket - are steering Names away from syndicates that are heavily exposed to catastrophe reinsurance, reducing Lloyd's capacity in the sector. Reinsurers unable to obtain adequate retrocession protec- tions, passed on the steep increases in their own rates last year, especially to UK insurers who had been exposed to the storms of January and February 1990. In setting rates for UK insur- ers, reinsurers now assume that the UK is prone to natural catastrophe loss. Rates are now only slightly lower than those charged to companies operat- ing in the Caribbean or other areas of the world more usu- ally associated with natural disaster. This year policy conditions could be tightened, although with rates already assuming that a weather catastrophe in the UK will occur one every four years there is little scope for further rate increases. In the meiantime reinsurance bro- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t kers, who act on behalf of cli- ents seeking to buy reinsur- ance cover, are leading efforts to find alternatives to tradi- tional catastrophe reinsurance policies. According to Mr Ron lies, the chief executive of Alexan- der Howden, \"product develop- ment\" in this area is likely to be an important feature of the London market in 1992. Brokers are promoting three alternatives in particular * Financial reinsurance deals are hybrid trainsactions als- way between banking and insurance. Generally deals are structured in order to generate a fund which will eventually be equal to the sum to be rein- sured finite risk reinsurance). Premiums paid into the fund are calculated taking into account the likely investment income needed to generate the finite sum as well as a profit for the reinsurer. If no claim is made on the policy some of the premium and sometimes a percentage of the rodfit is returned to the ceding insurer (the one who is buying the reinsurance). Mr Jim Payne, chairman of EW Payne, reinsurance subsidiary of Sedgwick group, says sinan- cial reinsurance allows a ceding insurer to buy the pro- tection of a reinsurer's balance sheet. * In franchise reinsurance the reinsurer agrees to provide reinsurance cover in the same way as in standard catastrophe reinsurance protections. How- ever a claim is triggered nly if a catastrophic- tlos ocurs (either for the cedant's whole book of business or from a spe- cific catastrophe event - such as a hurricane or explosion). This loss would be much greater than the level of cover offered. According to a broker at Willis Saber, the reinsur- ance subsidiary of Willis Cor- roon, a franchise reinsurance policy \"allows the reinsurers to move themselves further away from a loss.\" * In a further development proportional reinsurance (in which cedant and reinsurer share premiums and risk) poli- cies are being tailored to pro- tect against catastrophe losses. Some Lloyd's syndicates which have been heavily dependent on retrocessional business are diversifying their exposures by writing some proportional rein- surance policies. Although London brokers are optimistic about the poten- tial for such financial engineer- ing, others are more cautious: \"I'm confident excess of loss capacity will re-emerge as the main means of providing catas- trophe coverage - but it will be a different market with underwriters taking bigger net lines, more professional under- writing and risk assessment,\" says the Willis Saber broker. Such a development is inevi- tably likely to favour those professional reinsurers boast- ing a strong capital base and strong technical expertise. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the big Euro- pean reinsurers - backed as they are by investors inter- ested in long-term capital growth and sympathetic tax authorities - are welcoming this prospect. \"Lloyd's has a problem,\" says Mr Jurgen Zech, chief executive of Cologne Re, in which France's Victoire has a majority stake. \"The syndi- cates are very small. I wonder really how they will be able to provide expertise and know- ledge,\" he adds. \"Bit by bit it is clear that there are serious ramifications for those reinsurers who haven't the size to take net retentions,\" says Mr Nigel Har- ley, chief executive of Sorema, the reinsurance subsidiary of the French mutual Groupama, which began underwriting in London this year. \"We see this as definitely creating opportu- nity,\" adds Mr Harley.",

   "text_content" : "FOR some years, insurers and commentators have been cau- tiously predicting, more per- haps in hope than expectation, that a hardening in direct insurance rates was about to take place. The implosion of retroces- sion capacity under the impact of three successive years of large catastrophe losses makes it much more likely that enough pressure has finally been exerted for it to extend via primary reinsurers to the direct writers. A firming trend is already being reported for marine busi- ness, is anticipated in aviation and has struck those such as householders and drivers in the UK with a vengeance. A question mark remains, however, over large scale industrial fire and other large commercial covers. The operations of the corporate cli- ent continue to become more international, for medium as well as large enterprises, and the competition for global pro- grammes is severe. It remains to be seen if rein- surers on both sides of the Atlantic are equally keen to force through an increase in rates. In Europe, Industrial concentration in preparation for the Single European Mar- ket continues, and competition shows little sign of abating. If the industry generates too sharp a turn in the underwrit- ing cycle - if the phenomenon still exists - it may do so at its peril. Profound dissatisfaction with extreme short term fluc- tuations in the availability or price of a range of covers in the 1980s provided the impetus for the establishment not only of the so-called private insur- ers, Ace, CODA and XL, cover- ing product and directors' and officers' liability, but also the rapid growth of captive insur- ers covering property risks. As these have become more sophisticated, and capital has accumulated within them, their ability to move beyond simple covers and absorb less predictable risks and higher exposures has increased. One effect has been to with- draw a large tranche of pre- mium from the direct insur- ance market, 50 per cent or more in some countries. Where risk managers for large corporations still require the services of traditional com- panies, it is for increasingly sophisticated programmes involving the heavy provision of back-up services, unbundled or not, which only large insur- era can provide. Where they do not require such services, they are makin eqlly sophisti- cated demands of te reinsur- ers of their captives. The concentration of insur- ance capacity, particularly in Europe, has been partly in response to this reduction in premium for straightforward commercial line. Larger direct insurance units are not only capable of handling sophisti- cated risks; they are also able to retain a greater proportion of the risks written. The risks retained tend to be the most straightforward. As a result, reinsurers are shown an ever-decreasing volume of pro- portional treaty business and face an ever-increasing demand for catastrophe and aggregate loss covers. The alteration of the struc- ture of reinsurers' portfolios significantly raises their risk exposure. It is by no means clear that an increase in pre- mium is by itself sufficient to compensate shareholders or other providers of capital, par- ticularly at a time when rein- surers' requirements for capi- tal are becoming greater in response to the unusually high level of catastrophe losses. Nor is capital the only ele- ment in critical mass: equally important is the ability to accumulate reserves, in which national taxation policy plays a central role, as Uloyd's and the Association of British Insurers is reminding the UK government with increasing frequency. The root causes of the disequilibrium in reinsur- ance portfolios show no sign of abating. Multinationals are increas- ingly using their experience of risk management to deal with potentially huge losses result- ing from incidents such as product tamper or computer malfunction. As industrial production moves into larger units, insured values have multiplied, particularly in the petrochemi- cal industry. In addition, the mutual interdependance of such units throughout the world has led to an enormous increase in the potential for business interruption losses. An explosion or fire at a large petrochemical plant can cost more than a small bt sig- nificant natural catastrophe, However, prmiums for busd- noes interruption following fire have yet to reflect the fact. So ;ar, Germany has largely been immune from the trend towards self-insurance, reflecting the low premiums available The single European market will draw the German market towards the global norm. When the inevitable occurs, the effect will not be any more shattering than it has been in North America or Scandinavia, but it is likely to cause a pro- found change of attitude by German insurers, and the with- drawal of a large volume of premium, over time, from the traditional market. A substan- tial change in relationships between German insurers and their reinsurers will follow. Meanwhile premiums will be kept as low as the German market believes it can bear (or its reinsurers will allow) as it prepares for the novel situa- tion of fighting for its own market share. If the contraction of the ret- rocession market is passed back to the ultimate insured too sharply, and solely in terms of price or restriction of cover, a further turn of the screw may be the unintended result. Industrial insurance buyers have learned much in the past decade. Large multina- tional corpotioions are better capitalised than most direct insurers, and their potential for risk retention is by no means exhausted. If the direct insurance mar- ket cannot provide the stability which many risk managers require, they may begin to look for direct relationships with reinsurers instead. There is reason to suspect that it may be easier for reinsurers to per- suade industrial conglomerates to accept a greater retention of complex and potentially large exposures, and find more readi- ness to adopt the mechanisms necessary, than to persuade traditional insurance compa- nies to do the same.

   "text_content" : "INCREASED reinsurance rates helped the world's biggest rein- surance brokers perform strongly last year. Tis Year, although rates have risen r- ther in some sectors of the market, there has also been a reduction in reinsurance capacity and brokers are find ing the going harder. \"There is always a balance between price ries and the availability of capital,\" says Mr Jim Payne, chairman of EW Payne, the reinsurance subsid- lary of Sedgwick Group. \"At the moment the shortage of capacity is the key factor. In some sectors business cannot be written at any price.\" Last year big brokers and medium sized independents all increased their revenue. According to figures published by Business Insurance the spe- cialist weekly trade journal, the world's three biggest rein- surance brokers all saw size- able increases in revenues last year. Guy Carpenter, which is owned by Marsh McLennan, and includes the London-based broker, CT Bowring, saw a 10 per cent rise to about $WS0m. Payne says that it has increased brokerage revenues by 25 per cent in some key sectors. Alexander Howden, part of the Alexander & Alexander group, saw its revenues rise to about $139m (from $107m in 1989). The company attributes the increase to rate increases in the catastrophe market, but also says it won considerable 'Buyers are being much more cautious about which brokers they use' amounts of new business and increased market share. Smaller reinsurance brokers did even more impressively. In the US, Rollins Burdick Hunter, part of the highly aggressive Aon Corporation, nearly doubled its reinsurance income to about $50m. Jardine, Minet, CE Heath, Hogg and Bain Clarkson also saw rises of over 50 per cent. Lloyd Thomp- son and Bradstock, more spe- cialist London market broker- ages, also reported impressive gains. Increases in rates in the ,urr P#W - -Â· -II DWW co Ps --- -~ - ye, mus sw, cergo nase oilrgs catastrophe, marine and avia- tion markets were party responsible for the strong per- formance. But many of the big- ger operators also report an increase in market share, often at the expense of smaller brc- kers. \"We have benefitted from concern about the security of some of the smaller brokers. Buyers are being much more cautious about which brokers they use,\" said the spokesman for one large company. This year there has been fur- ther hardening in the catastrc phe, marine and aviation rein surance markets. But rate rises have been accompanied by a shrinkage in capacity. The reduction has been especially dramatic in the non-marine retrocession market in London, where a number of companies, including Yasuda of Japan and Cigna of the US and many more Lloyd's syndicates, have ceased to write new business. In the absence of traditional excess of loss protections, bro- kers are being forced to work hard to find alternative forms of catastrophe protection for their clients. Various new products are now being offered. A number of continen- tal companies are writing fran- chise covers. These are reinsur- ance contracts which come into effect once losses assume catastrophe dimensions. Brokers also report increased interest in financial reinsurance - a contract more akin to a banking than a rein- surance transaction which is is more flexible than a traditional reinsurance arrangement. The insurance buyer and the insurer agree to build up a fund, which is managed by the reinsurer on behalf of the rein- sured. The two parties agree in advance what profit the rein- surer should receive and, in some cases, if there is no claim, the reinsured is reim- Reinsurance capacity Is still relatively abundant and pricing relatively soft bursed all premiums paid. Mr Payne says financial rein- surance is now \"a main line trade for us - with covers often complimenting with tra- ditional products.\" Even in the London marine reinsurance market, which has been slower to react to the catastrophe losses of the 1987-1990 period and where, until recently, capacity has been more abundant, brokers are struggling to develop new products in order to meet shortfalls in capacity in the traditional catastrophe market. Innovation is a feature of the market. Mr Jonathan Marland, director at Lloyd Thompson, argues that more disciplined underwriting in which reinsur- ers and retroinsurers (reinsur- ers writing retrocession cover) retain greater quantities of risk on their own books and moni- tor their aggregate exposures more accurately is necessary. The marine retrocession market is unlikely to be pre- pared to provide so-called \"whole account\" covers (which protect all elements of a marine underwriter's expo- sure) but will offer separate policies to cover specific risks such as hull, cargo and oil rig risks. Outside the catastrophe rein- surance and retrocession mar- kets, reinsurance capacity is still relatively abundant and pricing relatively soft. In the proportional area (where rein- suring underwriters simply assume a fixed percentage of a direct insurer's risks for the same percentage of the pre- mium less a reinsurance com- mission which compensates the direct underwriter for acquisition and management costs), rates follow direct insur- ance rates, which on the whole remain soft, especially in the US. Facultative non-proportional covers, which provide reinsur- ance for a single risk such as a chemical plant, also remain soft especially in Europe. this reflects the continuing high levels of competition for the industrial risks business in general. Those brokers with global networks which allow them to co-ordinate quickly between a reinsurance buyer in one part of the world and a market in another, or arrange sometimes highly complex reinsurance packages speedily, are the best placed to do well. Other brokers are In the process of establishing their own global networks The world's three biggest brokers (Marsh McLennan, Alexander & Alexander and Sedgwick) are all in the throes of centralising their global operations. Other brokers such as Willis Saber, which merged with Cor- roon & Black last year, and Rollins Burdick Hunter, which is set to acquire Europe's larg- est independent broker, Hudig Langeveldt of Holland, are establishing their own global networks.

   "text_content" : "Lloyd's: recent disasters have hit all sctors of the market A series of losses and foreign competition have hit the market THESE are grim times for the UK's reinsurance industry which has seen profits squeezed by catastrophe losses and foreign competition. Although London can expect to remain at the centre of the international reinsurance mar- ket, the UK's own reinsurance industry is contracting. The second biggest UK's reinsurers, Victory Re, has already been sold to a foreign buyer. The owners of the first and third biggest reinsurance companies - the Prudential and Royal Insurance - have no long-term commitment to the sector. And syndicate man- agers at the Lloyd's market are reducing involvement in catas- trophe reinsurance business. All sectors of the market have been hit by the number 'and frequiehcy of natural disas- ters, fires and explosions that shook the insurance industry in the late 1980s. In the company market in the UK the disastrous sequence of catastrophes has exposed the financial weaknesses of the country's biggest specialist reinsurers and precipitated what is likely to become a series of disposals. Victory Re's vulnerability to large losses was one of the rea- sons why Legal & General sold the specialist reinsurer to the Dutch group, Netherland Rein- surance Group last July. Vic- tory was hard hit by the storms of January and Febru- ary 1990. In the 11 years between 1979 and 1989 Victory Re made underwriting losses of Â£20.5m against premium income of Â£661.8m. Mercantile & General Re, has also been dented which is one of the reasons why its owners, Prudential, is looking for a buyer. Its general reinsurance operations recorded underwrit- ing losses of Â£46.4m in 1989 (on premium income of Â£261.3m) and Â£110m in 1990 (on premium income of Â£304.3m. Overall between 1979 and 1990 under- writing losses totalled Â£300m on premium income of Â£2,612m. M & G was badly affected by its exposure to the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in July 1988. At Lloyd's the scale of recent losses has badly affected syndi- cates specialising in the catas- trophe reinsurance market and exposed the shortcomings of the retrocession market, where catastrophe reinsurers buy their own protections. Many of the Lloyd's syndi- cates worst hit in the past three years have been those heavily exposed to this class of business, although the the full scale of their difficulties will only be apparent after Lloyd's reports its results for the 1989 and 1990 years (in June 1992 and 1993). When Lloyd's reported an overall pre-tax loss of Â£510m for 1988 earlier this year - incidentally its first loss for over 20 years) the losses of a few specialist catastrophe syn- dicates were a dominant sea- ture. Syndicates recording heavy catastrophe-related losses include * Feltrim 540 which reported an nderti oss of M8 on gross pmium income of S3.4m in 1998. * Rose Thomson Young 255 - which recorded losses of Â£63.97m on premiums of * Gooda & Partners 2 which reported underwriting losses of Eo708M on premium lncome of .47Lm. * Cuthbert Heath 1084 - underwriting losses of Uim on premium incore of se7.o The eneretic reaction of Naies to the orale of lases at Peltrim, reclpitated-the clo- sure of the and the amnnunelat .by l4yd's of an uiAe1pmii aeqr b-ato the circumstances of the loss. Simi- lar inquiries have also been launched into the Gooda, Rose Thomson Young and Cuthbert Heath results. The losses have spelled the death of the retrocession spiral - the arrangements whereby reinsurers reinsure their risks with each other creating a chain of contracts that dilutes the impact of catastrophe losses across the market through time. Capacity on the retrocession market has virtually disap- peared, especially in the non- marine market and without retrocession cover many Lloyd's syndicates are just too small to insure catastrophe risks. The practice whereby syndicates simply passed on exposures to other reinsurers without retaining any risk for their own account - essen- tially a form of arbitrage - will eventually cease. A shake-out among syndi- cates specialising in reinsur- ance and retrocession business is now well underway with some syndicates being merged and others closed. Many Names will avoid syndicates writing catastrophe business. As many as 100 (many of them active in this sector of the market) of the 354 syndi- cates at Lloyd's in 1991 are likely to disappear by the beginning of 1992, with Lloyd's premium capacity - the amount of business the market is permitted to underwrite - shrinking by 10 per cent. It is now widely accepted that many of the syndicates specialising in catastrophe reinsurance at Lloyd's were too small; lacking both the resources and expertise to properly evaluate catastrophe risks and the financial strength to offer adequate lev- els of protection on their account. In a different way size has also been a problem in the company market, where spe- cialist reinsurers have been dwarfed by their continental competitors. With their accent on short term profits and grow- ing dividends, Britain's capital markets are an unfavourable environment for reinsurance, a highly volatile business which requires long-term and large scale commitments of capital European reinsurers enjoy much more favourable tax treatment than their UK com- petitors. The giant German and Swiss companies such as Munich Re and Swiss Re are allowed to build a special class of catastrophe reserves which can be offset against tax. In general tax authorities in mainland Europe are more sympathetic to the reinsurance industry than in the UK. Mr Joe Palmer, LAG's chief execu- tive at the time of the Victory sale, said last year. \"We con- cluded that the Victory group needed to be considerably larger if it were to compete over the longer term with the major international reinsur- ers.\" Without more capital \"Victory was condemned to a steady decline\", said Mr Palmer. Prudential views the opera- tion as marginal to its core financial services and life insurance business and is said to be looking far a buyer.

   "text_content" : "INCREASINGLY vocal complaints by some names at Lloyd's about the losses sus fered on the 1988 underwriting year have focused attention on the London Market Excess - the London market which spe cialises in providing reinsur- ance cover to reinsurers. In the 1980s, an increasing number of Lloyd's syndicates and London-based specialist companies concentrated on providing cover against high levels of loss for reinsurers. A typical contract would then be reinsured with other participants, who repeated the process, so that a single risk might pass through the same reinsurer a number of times, creating the \"LMX spiral\". The market grew spectacu- larly in the 1980s as reinsurers offshore and newly-indepen- dent nations became unwilling to assume the ultimate expo- sure to severe losses. The spi- ral replaced the geographic spreading of risk with a distri- bution over time. The often stately progress of claims through the LMX market gave participants time to recover the cash needed to pay their share. The introduction of elec- tronic settlement removed this cushion, so that when a string of catastrophes hit the market in the late 1980s, the impact was almost immediate. Claims from Hurricane Alicia in 1983 and the Piper Alpha drilling rig disaster in 1988 were said to have reached the top of the spi- ral simultaneously. Coinddentally, it was in 1988 that an Insurance Institute of London Advanced Study Group found a fundamental flaw in the LMX market: that it was \"infinitely cumulative\". For a high value risk, most if not all underwriters were likely to be involved, so that it became The Piper Alpha disaster exposed the deficiencies In assessment \"almost impossible to analyse the book of business written by an underwriter\". Especially within the Lloyd's marine market, spare capacity and a period of high profitabil- ity lured many underwriters into participation. The returns were a reflection of the fact for some years there were no large - that is, mar- ket-wide - catastrophes. As the IIL Study Group noted, LMX rating methods, in the absence of claims experi- ence, were only able to be based on an assessment made of the premium required for the limit of liability extended. The Piper Alpha disaster rudely exposed the deficiencies in assessment - and, in some cases, the inadequacy of esti- mates of aggregate exposure - of some participants in the market. Successful LMX under- writing required a reinsurance programme which matched maximum exposure. Some underwriters discovered, to their names' or shareholders' chagrin, that theirs did not. The readiness of the LMX market to provide catastrophe cover shrivelled overnight in the wake of an unprecedented series of losses in 1988-90, including hurricanes, winter storms in Europe and large industrial fires. A tactical withdrawal was made by the giant Merrett underwriting agency at Lloyd's in January 1990, with senior underwriter Mr Dennis Purkiss commenting that pure LMX was \"a false market\". According to Mr John Emney, chief underwriter of Charter Reinsurance Co, and one of the leading underwriters in the area, \"the LMX market as we know it is dead, and it isn't going to come back to life\". Names at Lloyd's are now clamouring to be removed from syndicates which write the secondary and tertiary lay- ers of reinsurance with the same vehemence with which they demanded to be placed on them three or four years ago. Few underwriters in the com- pany market can now justify to their shareholders the continu- ance of assuming the previous level of risk, Mr Emney says. One anxiety is that the fre- quency of natural catastrophes may be increasing, making them uninsurable. In the worst case - where they are an annual event - the minimum premium required will tend to approach the cost of the catas- trophe itself. At the same time, insured values including business interruption are increasing, and a large industrial fire can now be as expensive as a minor earthquake in San Fran- cisco. A number of stop-gaps are being offered to fill the void, but in Mr Emney's view these offer at best a palliative rather than a solution. So-called financial or finite-risk reinsur- ance (which returns a flow of payments and a share of any profit eventually made) makes the reinsured critically depen- dent upon the financial exper- tise as well as the capital strength of those offering cover. Furthermore, the biggest stumbling block, according to Mr Emney, is that there is no real transfer of risk from rein- sured to reinsurer. Franchise covers, which are activated at a level of claims affecting the market as a whole are another alternative. These are bedevilled by uncertainties over determina- tion of the trigger point. In the US, where insurers notify claims routinely to the Prop- erty Claims Service, it may be possible to determine the total value of a loss, but for claims 'Simply raising premiums will not succeed in restoring capacity' elsewhere the best that can be done is to use estimates pro- vided as a service to the mar- ket by Swiss Re, Mr Emney says. A further development is the attempt by large brokers to stimulate Lloyd's syndicates to write an increased volume of proportional covers, where the reinsurer shares automatically a percentage of the losses sus- fered by the insured. Such measures, Mr Emney argues, are not only not a solu- tion, but actively militate against the adoption of the structural changes necessary for high-level catastrophe cover to become an acceptable risk for names or shareholders. Nor does he believe that sim- ply raising premiums will suc- ceed in restoring capacity. An essential step, in his opinion, is a redefinition of catastrophe away from the losses caused by an event in favour of their impact on the net worth of the reinsured. Reinsurers would not then be asked to expose their own bal- ance sheets when no equiva- lent financial risk is run by the reinsured. Such a system implies not only a large increase in reten- tion by primary reinsurers and direct insurers, but also by original insureds. For householders' buildings insurance, for example, the tra- ditional cash deductible might be replaced by a percentage of property value, and reinsur- ance offered on the basis of an assumed level. The insurer would be free to vary the level actually charged to the house- holder as an element of compe- tition. Such a system offers the pos- sibility, Mr Emney argues, of a reduction rather Than contin- ued increase in the basic pre- miums charged for primary catastrophe coverage. Trevor Petch"

   "text_content" : "IN France perhaps more than anywhere else in Europe, there has in recent years been been a rapid concentration of insur- ance capacity through spectac- ular mergers. One result has been a shrinking demand for tradi- tional reinsurance covers where losses are shared pro- portionally in favour of protec- tion on an excess of loss basis. The increased retention capac- ity has contributed to the weakening of the reinsurance market, which is increasingly shown only less attractive business which requires larger capital resources. \"The market is unable to function well without recourse to reinsurance techniques no matter how heavy the concen- tration of the direct insurers,\" says Mr Jacques Bourthoum- ieux, president of SAFR. French reinsurance capacity is also coalescing, beginning with the merger of SCOR with UAP Re two years ago and the more recent regrouping of AGF Re and SAFR, which when fin- alised will replace Abeille Re as the second largest reinsurer in the country. Observers are unanimous in considering that the trend has yet to run its course, but future associations are likely to involve European partners and, possibly, reinsurance bro- kers. A new form of co-operation is being tested by Groupe Vic- toire's Abeille Re and Colonia, whereby the former will repre- sent Cologne Re in Canada while the latter company will act for Abeille Re in Mexico, Columbia and Venezuela. AXA Re's chairman Mr Christian Excoffier does not rule out a future merger either, provided it leads to an opti- mum size, at the right price, with a partner as a compli- ment. \"The future of AXA Re, as of other small reinsurers, is the obligation to grow in order to achieve the right dimension,\" he says. This is a strategic problem also emphasised by Mr Michel Laparra, his coun- terpart at Abeille Re. Size is important because cedants will in the long run become increasigly hard to please,a ad\"ilMl turni to large reinsurers as the best-equipped to accept novel and potentially expensive risks, according to Mr Gerard Boulier of Caisse Centrale de Reassurance (CCR). Mr Bernard Raoul, the Paris general manager of Nordisk Re, Employers' Re's European operation, is more optimistic, believing that the recent emer- gence of new small life and personal lines companies, such as Credit Agricole's Predica and Pacifica, may maintain or even increase slightly the vol- ume of premium ceded. If there is a place for small companies, it is in specialised areas. One such is Sorema, which is backed by the farming mutual Groupama, but even Sorema has spt up a subsidiary in London and branches in Cologne and Singapore. Merg- ers are unlikely to reduce the cut-throat competition which is also weakening the industry, Patrick Peugeot Increwse in nr ci premium mree nee :'::\"iÂ· Â·Â·. :6Â·:. Â· :IÂ· Â·;: ~ says its managing director Mr Christian Hure. Concern over the level of industrial risk rates is as uni- versal as that over catastrophe losses. Mr Bourthoumieux also blames an increased reliance by insurers on financial rather than underwriting operations, suggesting that premium growth has been bought at often excessive prices through external growth or generated There Is agreement among small and large reinsurers that a transformation In the market Is required although their areas of concern are not necessarily the same internally by technically unjus- tified rates. The concentration of manu- facturing industry, and the parallel development of cap- tives, has further imbalanced the relationship between indus- trialist, insurer and reinsurer, Mr Bourthoumieux believes. Motor results, too, are poor, while potentially attractive cedants such as the mutuals without interiedliiries, which underwrite the best 60 per cent of the motoi and householders' risk market, have never had extensive recourse to the rein- surance market. Their cover is presented en bloc, and concen- trates on exceptional risks. But while industrial risks and motor are the worst sec- tors, as Mr Eric Vernhes, presi- dent of CORIFRANCE, points out, the persistence over the years of poor market condi- tions put most branches into the red for most companies this year. SCOR president Mr Patrick Peugeot is by no means alone in urging an increase in direct premium rates and revision of underwriting practice, but advises that this be done in the most transparent possible way on a branch by branch basis to deflect possible criticism made by consumer organisations. There is complete agreement among both large and small reinsurers that a transforma- tion in the market is required, although their areas of concern are not necessarily the same. Mr Peugeot believes that reinsurers must change their attitude to catastrophe cover, which should cease to be an additional service rendered and become an important, long-term commitment. \"The situation in the London market is quite a problem for all of us,\" he says. With the important markets having reached their limits, he adds,professional reinsurers should require higher rates, better application of loss pre- vention techniques, and a more precise study of exposures. Given shrinking retrocession capacity, he also urges revised underwriting methods to reflect greater commitment and to distribute available capacity between different markets and cedants more effi- ciently. Mr Peugeot also wants some hard thinking to be done on how best to meet the demand from direct insurers for cover against such financial impon- derables as currency and equity market fluctuations, and tax changes which have an impact on overall results and solvency. Heeilso favours more regulii dialogue on an ongoing basis between insurers and reinsur- ers to develop stronger under- standing and avoid sudden developments which affect mutual confidence. Mr Excoffier believes a return to a more reasonable level of overall capacity may be five years away, with rein- surers becoming more restric- tive in their attitude in the interim due to the absence of retrocession capacity. Mr Bourthoumieux thinks any improvement in rates within two years is unlikely but hopes that the more drastic reduction in retrocession capacity this year may, unlike last year, force a more thor- ough increase in rates and the prospect of a return to profit- ability. A start to that process may be made at the Monte Carlo rendezvous. No-one disputes the gravity of the present situatinn which tion in the market is required, raises fundamental questions about the fature development of the industry. Not only do reinsurers won- der how much longer the heavy burden of catastrophe suffered in recent years can be main- tained, but concern for the future of the London market begs the question of how that much capacity can possibly be replaced.

   "text_content" : "NyumIns mo pool lor a reonsuranc of nua meu or ownm iurEnR was wouna up n AprI -1a year CCcP-4aU THE insurance markets of the command economies of eastern and central Europe were once models of stability, organised, with local variations, on Soviet lines. Each national market con- tained a monopoly insurer cov- ering local currency risks, typi- cally linked directly to the budget of the finance ministry. Most of its business would concern compulsory insur- ances, mainly for various agri- cultural risks, motor third party liability (except in the USSR itself) and various other property and third-party clas- ses, together with a smaller volume of voluntary business dominated by low-value life, pensions and accident policies and personal lines cover for motor damage and domestic property. Commercial covers remained underdeveloped. In part this reflected the absence of com- mercial risk; in part recogni- tion that cash compensation did not create the ability to reinstate the loss because of the rigidities of the system or simple shortages; and in part the notion that it was simply inefficient to use an insurer to transfer cash from one state enterprise to another. Soviet-style planners never, in any case, paid mucli'atten- tion to financial mechanisms. For the same kind of rea- sons, backed as they were by the resources of the ministry budget and accounting on a cash in-cash out basis, domes- tic insurers took out no rein- surance. This simple model was inad- equate for such international risks as marine and aviation, foreign trade or equipment bought with hard currency. Such \"foreign\" business was the preserve of a second monopoly, usually incorpo- rated as a share company owned by the state or state organisations, although in Romania and Hungary (until 1988) a department of the uni- tary monopoly was responsible for these operations, and in Czechoslovakia the Slovak state insurer surrendered responsibility for reinsurance to its Czech counterpart by \"mutual agreement\". Underwriting methods were by and large those of other international insurers, but accounting and reserving much less so. Substantial marine hull, lia- bility and cargo business, avia- tion liability and risks such as construction and engineering were ceded to western mar- kets. Yugoslavia, not a Comecon member, in the late 1970s cre- ated a reinsurer in each repub- lic and in the Serbian \"autono- mous province\" of Vojvodipq, and through them reinsured westernstyle property and nat- ural catastrophe potfois In the reverse drtion, the biggest direct business of the Comecon \"foreign\" insurers was trade-related cover and motor Green Card. In one of the rare coinci- dences of ideology and com- mercial good sense, the compa- nies spread their business in London between all the large brokers and often some small ones as well. Of the continental reinsur- ers, by far the most important provider of capacity was and remains Munich Re. The Soviet company Ingos- strakh was unsurprisingly the most active internationally, with subsidiary companies under the Black Sea & Baltic name in a number of European countries; its East German counterpart DARAG was, by contrast, almost invisible in international terms. Warta of Poland has a num- ber of representative offices abroad, a Romanian-owned underwriting agency operated in London until the mid-1980s and both Bulstrad of Bulgaria and the Serbian reinsurer Dunav Re all have joint ven- ture broking companies located in London. The Comecon foreign insur- ers also participated to a greater or lesser extent in active reinsurance. A combina- tion of poorly judged iinder- writing and political pressure to secure hard currency income regardless of potential losses frequently made this an unpleasant experience. Asbes- tosis claims which arose in US naval shipyards at the height of the Cold War are being paid in part from some unlikely sources. The most sophisticated active reinsurance operation was the European American Underwriters joint venture between American Interna- tional Group and the foreign insurers of Hungary, Poland and Romania. The largest segment of Com- econ insurers international business related to intra-Com- econ trade. The collapse of that organisation led to a drastic reduction in direct premium, in mutual reinsurance treaties, and in international co-opera- tion between the \"Insurers of Socialist Countries,\" who held their 29th and final annual meeting in April 1990. The biennial meeting of rein- surance experts scheduled for October that year did not take place, and in the same month the pool for the reinsurance of hull risks of Soviet-built air- craft was wound up. Other casualties were the Comecon Blue version of the motor Green Card, and a joint venture reinsurance company in Moscow which covered risks related to Comecon-funded investment projects. The prospect of finding cover in hard currency for ageing fleets of lyushins is the least of the companies' new prob- lems. With a substantial part of their traditional business lost and exports falling, they are further weakened by the potential or actual loss of their skilled staff to western compa- nies. Two former senior employ- ees of Allami Biztosito in Buda- pest have been headhunted three times in less than two years. In Hungary and Poland insurers with foreign capital are already providing competi- tion for traditional business, while in Bulgaria the former soft-currency monopoly, DZI, is aggressively writing foreign currency risks. At the same time, an enor- mous challenge is posed by the processes of de-linkage from the state budget, de-monopolis- ation and privatisation of domestic insurance now under way throughout the region, as well as the transition from a state-funded to an insurance- based welfare system. Financial independence for the relics of the old system implies not just restructuring and cash injection, but also reinsurance, for which local capacity is lacking and foreign capacity is discouraged by non- convertible currencies. The problem is most urgent in Poland and the USSR, where by design and accident respec- tively there has been rapid growth in nationally-owned, poorly capitalised insurers of at best unproven technical ability. Should these companies fail in significant numbers, the long-term development of already atrophied insurance markets will be hindered as surely as by the use of dubious sales techniques such as pyra- mid-selling already reported throughout the region. Although Polish supervisors have courageously suspended two companies on prudential grounds this year, their limited resources may in the end be swamped, while in the USSR the campaign to minimise state control may well go beyond the little-understood bounds of financial prudence. If western reinsurers want an orderly development of the new insurance market econo- mies, they may well have to assume the mantle themselves. Trevor Patch",

The Bangladesh cyclone in April this year (killing nearly 140,000 people), hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean and the USA in October 1989, the west Euro pean storms which wrought havoc in October 1987 and Jan- uaiy to March 1990 are just a few examples of the natural disasters the world has recently had to deal with. Before 1987, events which involved an insured loss of US$lbn or more (at current prices) occurred only once every few years on average. Since 1987, however, there has been at least one $1bn event each year. In a study of catastrophe losses over the period 1970-89 the insurer Swiss Re argues that \"natural catastrophes in OECD countries in the '80s demonstrate a clearly rising frequency and loss burden.\" Munich Re and Swiss Re studies of insured natural catastrophe damage show annual average loss rising slightly during the 1970s, from around $1.5bn per year in 1970 to around $2bn per year in 1980. During the early '80s the annual loss reached an average of $5bn, peaking at $14bn to $15bn in 1990, a year domi- nated by the west European storms in January and Febru- ary. Munich Re in its 1991 analy- sis of large natural disasters over the last three decades says \"loss burdens from natu- ral disasters are increasing dramatically; from the 1960s to the 1980s economic losses have virtually tripled, while insured losses have quintupled\". Natural disasters in 1990 caused economic losses of $47bn of which about $15bn was insured, says Munich Re. A further breakdown of the insured loss shows that $13.4bn (87 per cent) was due to wind- storm, $800m due to flood, $300m due to earthquakes. Swiss Re says that the series of catastrophe losses poses \"an immense challenge to the insurance system\". It ways that \"should the storm losses of 1989 and 1990 only be statistical mavericks, the gaps in reserves could be replenished, given an appropri- ate premium calculation\". But if both the size and fre- quency of these losses increase in the coming years then the insurance industry will face grave problems. Storm Daria caused severe damage in the UK and the Netherlands on 25 and 26 Janu- ary 1990 and led to an insured loss of $4.6bn, according to Swiss Re. That is around $100m more in real terms than the insured damage caused by Hurricane Hugo in October 1989, making it the largest cat- astrophic loss ever. And yet Daria was only one of eight large storm events in western Europe between Janu- ary and March 1990 which together caused insured losses totalling around $10bn. Munich Re chairman, Dr Horst Jannott, says that the recent experience of natural disasters has \"made it clear again and to an unparalleled extent that natural hazards - especially windstorm, earth- quake and flood - with their accumulation potential lead to a recurrence of heavy and ever increasing burdens for direct insurers and their reinsurers\". On the basis of past disas- ters, it is now possible to pre- dict the likely effects of such events on different parts of the world. Dr Herbert Tiedemann, engi- neering consultant to Swiss Re has studied the 1984 Munich hailstorm. He estimates that damage could have been DMlObn ($5.70bn) if such a storm had occurred in Frank- furt. In a large American city car damage alone could reach around DM25bn, he says, with the loss figure doubling to DM5Obn for all property dam- age. Swiss Re and Munich Re estimate that possible insured loss from large earthquakes in Tokyo and San Francisco could be between $50-100bn. Dr Horst Jannott says that \"direct insurers and reinsurers would therefore be well advised to give top priority to the correct underwriting of risks involving natural hazards in order to control the growing loss potential better,\" but adds that \"in many insurance mar- kets this is still not happen- ing\". According to Dr Tiedemann \"rating, underwriting and the protection of the exposure of insurers is very frequently based on incomplete and even defective understanding of the probability and magnitude of catastrophes\". However, in the light of the recent increase in the size of losses, European reinsurers have been taking a second look at the way risks are insured. Dr Dlugolecki chief manager, operations at General Acci- dent, Perth, argues that more reinsurers are now projecting potential future losses using scientific methods rather than simply using the past as a guide to the future. He says that reinsurers are now \"very keen on trying to get better information on their exposure especially to flood and windstorm perils\". One method is to use postcodes to evaluate more precisely the loss experience and loss potential'of particular areas. However, he says that this involves a lot of work and \"cannot just be introduced overnight\". Dr Dlugolecki says that in the past reinsurers' clients thought it was sufficient to have just one reinstatement. Now they are opting for multi- ple reinstatements and reinsur- ers are paying a great deal of attention to this critical sea- ture of their policies. Dr Dlugolecki argues that as economies become more advanced, there is a greater concentration of wealth in both industrial plant and domestic households. Coun- tries are becoming more urban- ised, industrial plant are becoming larger and holding more inventories (of things such as hydrocarbons and chemicals). This concentration of values has two effects. Firstly, it increases the size of potential direct property loss and secondly, it prolongs the time needed to rebuild or repair the lost property, so increasing potential business interruption losses.

   "text_content" : "Industrial risk rates are out of step with the new size of losses AS industrial plant increase in size and complexity, so does the price of disaster, as recent explosions and fires have high- lighted. But while the size of losses has been rising at an alarming speed, the worry for reinsurers is that industrial risk rates are simply not high enough. Most vulnerable are the hydrocarbon and chemicals industries. According to a recent Munich Re publication* \"losses and the loss potential in the chemical and petrochem- ical industries have reached a completely new order of mag- nitude.\" A large industrial loss can now cause about the same insured loss as a small natural catastrophe. An explosion at Phillips Petroleum's Pasadena, Texas petrochemicals plant in Octo- ber 1989 killed 23 people and caused an insured loss of US$1.4bn, around half of which was business interruption. A few days before the Phillips explosion, the 7.1 Rich- ter earthquake epicentred at Loma Prieta 60 miles southeast of San Francisco cost 69 lives and caused an estimated insured loss of US$1.5bn. Natural phenomena can actually be the cause of an industrial loss, rather than a fire or an explosion. Hurricane Hugo caused an insured loss of over US$270m to an oil refinery on St Croix, US Virgin Islands in September 1989, while the US winter freeze in December 1989 caused shutdowns and B/I losses totalling more than US$130m at three hydrocarbon plants in Texas and Louisiana. Recent years have seen the cost of business interruption (B/I) growing faster than that of property damage. In the cases of the freeze losses, insured loss was almost entirely B/I - insured property loss totalled just USSim. The largest single fire loss in 1990 - in July at the ARCO petrochemical plant at Chan- nelview, Texas - while not on the scale of -the Pasadena or Piper Alpha explosions, also highlights the trend for larger B/I losses. In this case property loss amounted to US$20m while B/I losses reached 10 times that amount at US$200m. Large industrial plant are becoming larger and increas- ing the concentration of equip- ment and inventory. This means that the property dam- age caused during, say, an unconfined vapour cloud explo- sion is likely to be bigger than in the past, causing more dam- age and such plants are likely Developments in the industrialisation process have altered the risk in the fires sector to take longer to rebuild, lead- ing to larger B/I claims. \"The industrialisation pro- cess, more complex and longer production stages, the increas- ing interdependence of produc- tion processes, the centralisa- tion of production in large plants with a corresponding concentration of values - these developments have altered the risk situation in the fires sector.\" the Swiss Rein- surance Company (Swiss Re) says in its review of large losses This contrasts with natural catastrophes. Here both the frequency and size of loss seem to be increasing, and yet in the case of large man-made indus- trial losses the Munich Re study finds \"no evidence of any significant increase in the loss frequency in recent years; not the number of losses but their cost has increased.\" More B/I is being purchased in the hydrocarbon processing industries than in the past, and there is more take up of sup- plier/customer extensions. Mr Daniel F O'Donovan, managing director of insurance brokers Marsh & McLennan recognises that the cost of BI to the hydrocarbon and chemi- cal industry is heavy. \"The 1989 losses, along with an explosion in May 1988 at a refi- nery near Norco, Louisiana, have had enormous effects on downstream production and worldwide feedstock supplies,\" he said. \"Interdependency within companies and supplier or cus- tomer relationships have spread the business interrup- tion losses well beyond the plant that sustained the loss,\" he added. A paper studying the hydro- carbon processing industry by Mr Brian Instone of CIGNA Worldwide argues that \"the average value of business interruption losses is consis- tently higher than the property damage average values and may well reflect the plant design, construction and opera- tion philosophy practised by the industry over the last two decades.\" While the cost of BI is rising, the industry is also coming to the realisation that recent industrial disasters are not simply freaks but regular occurrences. Munich Re's study of large losses in the chemical and pet- rochemical industries between November 1987 and December 1989 finds that \"nobody knows whether the Pasadena explo- sion disaster represents a peak in the series of large and very large losses that have hit the chemical and especially the petrochemical industry in the ast few years or whethe- the next, possibly even larger loss, may be just around the cor- ner.\" The study finds that \"analy- sis of the 35 losses reveals that in the majority of cases the events cannot be described as 'extraordinary or unforeseea- ble' - apart from the absolute loss amounts.\" It adds that \"losses of similar extent have to be expected in the future and, in view of the loss potential 'in property and B/I insurance, even larger losses cannot be ruled out.\" What worrys reinsurers is that industrial risk rates are not sufficient to cover such fitureo Inea us Tniiatryv Cnures suggest that worldwide pre- mium payments for property damage and B/I in the hydro- carbon and chemicals process- ing industry now amount to around US$1.2bn annually. This represents a mere 80 per cent of the cost of a single loss - the explosion at Phillips Petroleum's Pasadena, Texas which cost US$1.4bn. Given that large industrial losses will continue to occur, Munich Re argues that two fundamental requirements have to be met to provide insureds with the cover they need. Firstly, policies must define clearly the scope of cover for direct insurers and reinsurers against the insured perils, whether these are named-perils or all-risks covers. This should include: * precise descriptions of which losses are covered, and proper calculation of replace- ment or indemnification values for both property and B/I losses * realistic PML (probable maximum loss) values that fully consider past loss experi- ence * limits of indemnity in cases where the loss probability defies any reliable estimate * precise lists of subcontrac- tors and customers with a major loss potential. Secondly, the correct cost of cover is needed with the intro- duction of premiums that are commensurate with the risk and the scope of that cover. The Munich Re study adds that \"statistical documentation and expert knowledge of risks, which are prerequisites for cal- culating equitable premiums, are, in fact, available at the major insuring and reinsuring companies; and yet property and B/I insurance for chemical and petrochemical risks is largely underrated\". * M4for Losses in the Chewd- cal and Petrochemical Indus- trs, pbisheid nSchaden SPR*gl, JbWanry 1991 Simon Reynolds",

   "text_content" : "UK life reassurers have not yet felt the full effects of recession THE UK life assurance industry is in a recession. For the first time in decades, new business, growth is down on the previous 12 months. As yet, the big life reassurers in the UK have not fully expe- rienced the effects of this decline. Their business, to date, is holding up well. This, in itself, is not surpris- ing. There is a time lag of sev- eral months between events and experience with the direct writing life companies and the reassurers. Indeed, in 1990 when new business fell dra- matically for many life compa- nies, business for the reassur- ers moved ahead. As the personal pension mar- ket ceased to grow, many inter- mediaries switched to market- ing \"Keyman insurance\" - high level protection for key executives in companies. Keyman insurance reuires far more reassurance ities than personal pension biness and the large reassurers have benefited from this switch in marketing emphasis. However, the popularity of Keyman insurance proved to be short-lived. As the recession in the economy became deeper, companies cut back on insur- ing executives, however essen- tially such people were to the running of the business. And reassurers in recent months have seen the require- ments for this type of reassur- ance start to fall Wff. The mar- ket for straightforward reas- surance business is becoming tight. But reassurers have long since ceased playing a pasive role in the UK life mi \"e ad wait for their bread-d but reassurance business to come to them from the direct writing companies. The reassurers have for sev- eral years taken an active role Reassurers have helped boost the operations of direct writing life companies in boosting the operations of direct writing life companies. This role can be classified under three headings: 0 Giving active help to new companies starting up. * Giving active help to com- panies to develop and market new products. * Providing investigative ser- vices to companies where expe- rience has become adverse with certain types of products, whether in the marketing or the claims or- in general prit- ability or lack of it. This vice provided by reassurer I now roving vital for many g to break into t=ecrjitica Over the past few years, cer tain unit-linked companies have followed the leadgiven by Abbey Lift, in marketing critical illness contracts (some- times referred to as dread dis- ease contracts). Under a criti- cal illness policy, the cover is paid out if the life assurance contracts an severe illness, such as cancer, or becomes dis- abled. Otherwise the cover is paid on the death of the life assured. The reassurers, particularly Mercantile & General, did much work developing these contracts, in particular assess- ing and costing the underlying risks and pricing and profit- testing the contracts. The work involved actuaries going beyond their normal field of assessing the risk of death into assessing the mor- bidity rates for various serious illnesses for which cover was being given. In this respect, the reassur- ers are now better placed to carry out this kind of product development than many direct life companies. The reassurance companies are in the risk business. They have the actuaries and under- *Witers constantly involved in asaussing a variety of risks. These companies in the UK are invariably part of large multi- national reassurance compa- nies, so the UK actuaries will have easy access to data in ier coputries and can call on experience of their over- sas Iiga~ghes with similar In contrast, many direct writing companies, particu- larly unit-linked companies are concerned mainly with market- ing and investment, rather than risk assessment. The actuarial technicians are more and more to be found in the reassurance companies. The unit-linked companies have achieved considerable success in the critical illness market through their employ. ment of direct sales teams. But until recently, indepen- dent advisers had ignored this market for a variety of reasons and traditional life companies, with one or two exceptions such as General Accident Life, had kept out of this market. Now, with other sources of business drying up, indepen- dent advisers are turning to marketing critical illness con- tracts and the traditional life companies are needing these contracts in a hurry. As such they have turned to the reassurers, which in, turn have been able td help the tra- ditional companies bring their critical illness contracts on the market far quicker than if those direct companies had had to start from scratch. Life companies wishing to know about the critical illness market need only acquire the in-depth research documents, such as those produced by Swiss Re to find out most, if not all, of what is required. Now, the reassurers are hav- ing to back their assessment by accepting the reassurance on critical illness contracts. Penlsonr: resurr n* *xploring long4erm car products The pioneering life compa- nies in this field kept the cover limits low. Now life companies are offering unlimited cover - a move that involves more reassurance. A decade or two ago, the reassurers backed a number of life companies com- ing into the UK life assurance market when conditions were booming. The problem then was to educate these new companies in controlling the rate of expansion of business so that those companies did not over- stretch their capital resources. Many of these companies are now running into problems with the fall off in new busi- ness. The reassurers are now advising these companies as to the best means of weathering the recession. Munich Re has produced a series of papers on the subject for its client companies. The economic recession has resulted in the services of reas- surers in checking out the experience on PHI (Permanent Health Insurance) contracts. These contracts pay income to policy-holders who are ill or disabled for long periods. Because of the recession, peo- ple claiming PHI benefits are not in a hurry to state that they are fit to resume work. As such, certain life companies are experiencing heavy losses on this type of business. Investigations by reassurers usually reveal that the life company has inadequate claim controls - again an area where the reassurers have con- siderable practical experience. Finally, reassurers are talt- ing a leading role in exploring the new and growing field of long term care. With the num- bers of elderly people in the UK expanding steadily, the demand for care and services will certainly grow. People will need to plan in their middle age for the meeting the costs of care when they become old. The life assurance industry is the natural medium for pro- viding contracts to build up funds. But it is a new field and the reassurers consider that they have the expertise to assess the risks and design and cost the products. Eric Short"

   "text_content" : "Industry worried by prospect of paying for environmental clean up ONE of the biggest questions hanging over the non-life insurance market in the 1990s is who will pay for cleaning up the environment. Coming on the back of the vast sums that have been paid out in recent years on asbestos bodily injury claims, many observers think that insurers' and reinsurers' solvency is at stake. In the US, the scope of liabil- ity for environmental costs seems infinitely expansive and the law in Europe and Japan seems destined to follow a sim- ilar, if less draconian, route. The costs involved take one's breath away. The US Environmental Pro- tection Agency estimates an eventual aggregate cost for clean ups of around US$60bn. The US Congress' Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) puts it at $500bn. These figures are just for fed- eral clean ups. Behind them, a 1989 survey found more than 28,000 sites on state priority lists. Consultant Tillinghast has estimated total costs to insurers from inactive hazard- ous waste sites in the US at between $41bn and $1,065bn, depending on the extent of the clean up and the degree to which insurers' liability poli- cies are ruled to cover such costs. Insurers, for their part, are vigorously resisting coverage in the US courts, with no clear trend emerging yet in the judg- ments. If the judgments started to go against insurers, the result could be disastrous, or possibly terminal for the insur- ance market, according to Mr Mark Hewett of brokers Bowr- ing Re. In the meantime, some hard lessons have been learned from the asbestos experience, partic- ularly about reinsurers who are reluctant to pay up. Earlier this year, representatives of the London market Asbestos Working Party (AWP) announced an understanding with six leading European rein- surers. This agreement marked a breakthrough in a long-run- ning dispute which has been taking place between direct insurers (cedants) and their reinsurers. Reinsurers have found it hard to believe that they are liable for the amounts of money that direct insurers have been paying out to resolve the massive backlog of asbestos bodily injury claims. Many of those claims are being settled, not directly between victims and asbestos producers, but through generic sharing arrangements under the 1985 Wellington Agree- ment, the Asbestos Claims Facility set up as a result and the facility's successor, the Centre for Claims Resolution. These mechanisms were designed to reduce legal and other service costs, and to avoid cross-claims between asbestos producers where it is uncertain to whose asbestos materials a victim has been exposed. Insurers subscribing to the agreement are convinced that they have saved enormous sums of money by settling claims in this way. But the arrangements mean that a producer, and conse- qupntly its insurers, makes payments in cases which do not directly involve its own products. On the other hand, other producers contribute towards 'The Hiscox judgment was a narrow one and one that will not apply to most reinsurance in the market' I I1 I I1 I1 * i - 1 1 15 1 I l l I 11 II I 11 settlements that do involve its products. The sharing formu- lae are designed to make sure of an equitable distribution overall. The understajding announced in March involved direct insurers providing greater information to the rein. surers on the settlements that are being made, in the form of London Asbestos Reinsiurance Information (LARI) checklists, to supplement the which is data already supplied by indi- vidual cedants. The hope was that a smoother relationship with the big reinsurers would set the pattern for reinsurance gener- ally and isolate the relatively few smaller reinsurers who have resisted payment. More recently, the under- standing seemed to receive a knock from an appeal court ruling in London, involving two Lloyd's syndicates, man- aged by Outhwaite (Underwrit- ing Agencies) and Roberts & Hiscox. This ruled that reinsurers do not have to pay for settlements which cedants entered into without being legally liable for them. The implication appears to be that reinsurers can demand to see the details on .every single settlement and that all market sharing arrangements are unworkable. Mr Sebastian Salama, of Lon- don reinsurance brokers Alex- ander Howden, who has been assisting the AWP, takes a less pessimistic view. He points out that the Hiscox judgment was a narrow one that will not apply to most reinsurance in the market, and that both the judgment and the underlying arbitration award specifically acknowledge the savings brought about by the Welling- ton Agreement. Mr Robin Jackson, chairman of the AWP, has circulated the market appealing for calm, saying that the AWP's legal and technical advisers are looking at the matter and that the AWP is hoping to clarify the situation by the end of Sep- tember. Mr Salama says that he expects the large professional reinsurers to continue paying claims settled under the Agree- ment, though he foresees some recalcitrant reinsurers using the Hiscox judgment as simply another reason for not paying what are legitimate claims entered into in good faith by their cedants. Some reinsurers are even refusing to pay on settlements covering producers that were never parties to the Wellington Agreement, so never partici- pated in the sharing arrange- ments. \"I am not worried about the major reinsurers,\" he says. \"These are honourable upright, renowned companies that act in good faith. Above all, they are professionals who have been in this business a very, very long time. They know that in the London market, we have acted and continue to act professionally. \"I am worried about the smaller, \"non-professional\" reinsurers, who either do not understand or do not wish to understand, or do not have the ability to pay and are not admitting that. \"These we are going to smoke out and to pursue through joint market action.\" Mr Michael Mendelowitz, of London solicitors Barlow Lyde & Gilbert, argues that, if any kind of sharing arrangement is contemplated for pollution, it is vital that direct insurers get reinsurers' agreement first. Mr Salama reports that the AWP has already taken on board the need for good communications between the two sides. The problem with pollution, Mr Hewett argues, is that it is a much more complicated issue: \"It comes in so many different guises and the tech- nology is changing so fast. The legal and scientific goalposts are shifting all the time.\" In that context, where no one really knows what an \"occurrence\" is, what the cov- erage triggers are or what the losses will be, reinsurers are unlikely to give a \"carte blanche\".
