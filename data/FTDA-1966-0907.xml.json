   "text_content" : "by a white man By Our South African and Foreign Staffs Dr. Bendrik Verwoerd, the South African Prime Minister, who would have been 65'to-morrow, was assassinated in Parliament in Cape Town early yester- day afternoon. 1Tb assassin was a temporary Parliamentary messenger, believed to be a naturalised Greek, called Dintrl Tsatfendas, who is known to have thought, ironically enough, that Dr. Verwoerd was doing too nm\"h for South Africa's non-white population, and not enough for \" poor whites \" like himself. Toafendas is said to have had an obsession for quoting the bible. Dr. Vetwoerd's sudden death, coming as it does at the height of his political career, has produced reactions of shock and uncertainty from leading statesmen in every part of the world, not least among the delegates to the Commonwealth Conference in London, who were just beginning their great debate on Rhodesia. \"Tsafendas barged his way past, MPs on the floor of the debating chamber,\" our Cape Town Correspondent cabled in an eye-witness account, \" to get to Dr. Verwoerd, who had only just taken his place on his front-row bench. He pulled out one of three stiletto daggers he had on him and plunged it four times into the Prime Minister; into his heart, right lung, left lung, and neck. \" The House of Assembly bells summoning members were still ringing, as Government members, headed, by Mr. Frank Waring, Minister of Sport and a former Springbok Rugby player, pulled Tsafendas off Dr. Verwoerd. Pandemonium broke out as members attacked Tsafendas and carried him bleeding from the. chamber. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Own Coriipondent DELEGATES from Britain, Nor- way, Russia and Japan attending the eight-day Antarctic whaling conference in Tokyo neached an agreement to-day on shares of the global quota of 3,500 blue whale units for the 1966.67 season. The agreement is expected to be signed on Thursday afternoon, pre- sumably after each country's repre- sentative has consulted his Govern- ment. Under provisions of the agreement, Japan will be authorised a catch of l,633 blue whale units (46.67 per cent), the Soviet Union has agreed to catch no more than L,067 blu whale units (30.48 per cent.), and Norway will hold down its catch. to 800 blue whale units (22.85 per cent.). Last season the Japanese quota wa met at 52 per cent., Russia's at 20 pet cent., and Norway's 28 per cent. The international quota of 3,500 units was established by the International Whalig Commnission this June in London. Although Britain received no quota for this season under the agreement, Mr. R. 0. R. Wall, British Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, the conference chairman, retained Ant- arctic whaling rights for the 1967-.6 season. TOKYO, Sept. 6. Britain is not participating in Antarctic whaling at the present time, although there is a fleet in being at Leith, Scotland. The conference opened on August 31 but delegates were deadlocked over the week-end because the Soviet dele- gate was holding out for a quota share of at least 33 per cent. The deadlock was broken by Japan's willingness to give up a small portion of its share on the basis of past blue whale catch records. Or Cemoaadity Editor write: There will be relief in international fishing circles that the three whaling nations have reached asreement on sharing the catch If this had not happened there would have been a serious danger that the feets would have headed for the Antarctic intent on free-for-all whaling. The only limitation would have been the quota share each country thought it should be entitled to. This would have endangered every other aiternational fishing agreement. Any limitation whatsoever on the size of the actual catch should help to preserve the rapidly diminishing whale stocks. Even so. the catch figure of 3,500 blue whale units set in London last June ignored expert scientific advice-which considered that around 2,000 units would be a safe number to ensure preservation of the whale. The term \" Blue Whale Unit\" Is a misnomner to-day, for as there are so few of these mammals left there has bein an international agreement which forbids their being hunted for the neat five,years Thus a Blue Whale Unit now means either _40 alvMW:r,646 whiles."

But there is more than a sentimen- tal desire for the open spaces behind the move westwards across the TPaoifc.. Tbi Americans haia shrewdly assessed the eoraoanios potential capacity of the backward northern pastoral country, avail- able on 30-year to 50-year lease- holds at rentals that seem insigni- ficant in relation to high-priced land in the U.S. New Techniques The American invasion coincides with the beginning of a pastoral revolution in the tropical north, where scientists have forecast five fold to tenfold increases in aring capacity with the 'introduction of new grazing techniques.. With their experience and large capital re- sources to invest in bores, fencing and pasture improvement, the Americans are expected to give a new impetus to the forces of change. American investment, and new legumes recently developed, should raise cattle numbers in the penin- sula from 100,000 to Sm. head. according to Senator Malcolm Scott, chairman of the Government parties' national development com- mittee. The pace and scope of the development programmes in hand suggest his forecast may well prove right. Every American who has bought holdings recently in Cape York ha done'uore dvevn o wrk- in six months than has been thewd 'oru th\"a: rpropertfe in their lons previous history, accord- ing to Sir William Ounn. leading cattleman.

Sme Aterleau cattle leaders believe the sow of money into Australian pastoral land will grow as political instability dis- courages further investment on its present scale in South America. Big Groups .The initiative in pastoral invest- ment is far from being, monopo- lise' by the Americana, The British, witw'their long asiociation with Australian land development, hold an easy lead among overseas rural investors, and large acquisi- tion. in recent years by powerful wool broking houses indicate the impetus has not been lost. Australians, too, have been active in taking up northern hold- ings, both as individual farmers and as large corporate groups such as the Hooker group and the newly-fprmed Stanbroke Pastoral Holdings, headed by the leading life offlCe, theb Australlan Mtal Provident Society, with Thomas Borthwick of Britain as one of its partners. In the scrub country of eastern central Queensland, Australian cattlemen are developing the largest single rural project in Australia, extending over Ilm. a-ce. The initial difficulties of many of these farmers in financing their projects, however, illustrates the fact that development in much of the outback cattle country is a task for powerful corpotations with strong resources to withstand the strains of drought and other adversities. Yet it is the domination of the big companies with the inevitable frequency of absentee holders which has brought much of the criticism of overseas investment in b not from Australian cattlemen S . leadeM, who have in fict weldo6 ed I- the new wave of American invert * ment. Broadly the criticism is I, political in origin with its main focus in the Labour Party. .

There has been some s rethinking lately about overseas land settlement schemes in Western Australia by the governing Liberal and Country coalition parties. The parties have recommended the Government to withdraw research t. rights over more than half of a S4m. acre area of mostly desolate 0 land along the south coast, from a n group of American. British, French t and Australian investors. i.

He proposed greater Com- Ln monwealth control of capital 1e inflow and a review by the State in of the leases of foreign investors. n. who, he said, were interested only As in making quick capital gains. Ig Regardless of what political M action may be taken, there is :h greater incentive to-day for cattle- a men to achieve a better perform- Is ance than in the past. The rapidly kd growing market for manufacturing r beef has given the northern graziers an assured outlet for their leo produce and the new road net- le works are ending their isolation. ra These are pointers to the increased le investment and better management in that are needed in the north.",

   "text_content" : "Staff From Our U.S. Staff ORGANISED labour, to whom this session of Congress has been for .the most part a succession of unpleasant setbacks, is finding consolation in the minimum wage Bill which is likely to become law this week. The provisions of the measure follow closely those approved earlier this year by leaders of the APL-CIO (American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations). The timing of final Congres- sional approval, however, has meant a slight disappointment to the President. In an effort to repair his political fences with the campaign fund-donating AFL-CIO he had hoped to sign the measure into law actually on Labour Day. This plan was dropped when Republicans made clear they would adopt procedural delaying tactics, to. prevent this. Differences resolved A joint conference between mem*. bers of the Senate and of the House of RePreMstativess quickly reved WASHINGTON, September 6. Bill which finally emerged from the session was more or less that agreed to by the President and by Mr. George Meany, the AFLCIO presi- dent, some months ago. Some 30m. workers who are at present covered by legislation which guarantees a minimum wage of S1.25 will next February 1 receive an in- crease to S1.40. On February 1, 1968, this will be raised to $1.60. Originally the. House voted to delay the second increase until February, 1969: this has been todsed out. In addition, the scope of the legisla. tion has been widened still further to include an extra 8m. workers who until now have traditionally been excluded from minimum wage legisla- tion. These include labourers on large farms-invariably a poorly paid group-and employees of hotels, motels and laundries. Such workers will be guaranteed a minimum wage of Sl. The joint conference rejected a Republican-sponsored Senate amend- ment which would have broadened the provisions for the exemption -of small businesses. The law would have applied only to business, with an nnal turnover oanm S350,000, doroppe.",

CAR SALES declined again last month, though the setback was the smallest since the industry entered its current sales slump last April. For the final ten 'days of August, indeed, industry sales rose by 2 per cent. from a year earlier, to register their first such improve- ment since late April. For the whole of August, sales by the four domestic manufacturers -General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler and American Motors- fell 4 per cent. from a year ago to 607,541 units. On a daily selling rate basis, GM, the largest manu- facturer, registered a 9.5 per cent. sales drop to 309,975 units and American Motors one of 15.6 per cent. to 22,294. Chrysler's Upturn Chrysler, however, lifted its sales 8.3 per cent. to 105,584 cars and Ford 2.1 per cent. to 169,688. In the pro- cess Ford raised its share of the mar. ket for domestically-built cars last month from 26.3 to 27.9 per cent and Chrysler from 15.4 to 17.4 per cent.

Boeing and Lockheed, who are competing for the airframe contract, each reportedly submitted 8,000 pages of blueprints and engineering data. General Electric and Pratt and Whitney-in competition to build the engines--handed over rather thinner documentation. The plans will be examined by a panel of over 200 Government experts from the Federal Aviation Agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the National Space and Aeronautics ,Administration, the U.S. Navy and the Air Force. This. panel is to divide into six main groups-airframe, technical, engine, , technical. system integration manage- ment and manufacturing cost and economics. Panels from each of the groups will spend two weeks at the end of this month visiting plants of the respective companies. In addition. each of the ten domestic and 21 foreign airlines interested in the pro- ject will study competing designs. The Government panel is not sup. posed to make a definite recommen- dation of one deqign over another: instead it is to make a technical evaluation for FAA Administrator Mr. William McKee. His job is to hand these findings, together with those of the airlines (and presumably his own views) over to Mr. Johnson who will actually make the final choice. According to the present schedule, I the President should do this early next yearE. -Lockheed and Boeing are submitting plans for sharply contrast- ing aircraft; Lockheed a delta-shapedo WASHINGTON, Sept 6. aircraft and Boeing a variable sweea wing aircraft. But it is by no mean certain that the examining committee will choose one single design. In faci it has three choices: 1) to reject boti designs on the grounds that neithe. designer has come up with an air craft that is technically-or economic ally-feasible; 2) to select on air. craft and one engine design which would build two prototypes. The cost of this, including 100 hours flight testing, would be $1,300m. (this figure includes all previous research expen- diture); or 3) to advise on the build. ing of one prototype of each design ;o that the companies would battle it out on flying performance rather than on the drawing board. Such a move would probably add another 5500m. to development costs.

   "text_content" : "ADVERTISEMENT THE CANADIAN MARKET The Golden Horseshoe: the core of the economy By a Special Correspondent In Toronto Canada is a federal state and It is thus only natural that Its inhabitants have a fooling of loyalty to their own province as well as to the country as a whole. Canadians are quick to explain to the visitor what speolal contribution their pro- vince is making to the Canadian way of life and the country's economy. The fact remains, however, that Ontario Ia the biggest single slice of the Canadian market for both industrial and consumer goods. Moreover, dasplte its 1,000tmlle.by-1,000 -mile spread, the bulk of its population and the greatest part of its industry is conaen* trated In one-tnth of its area, the part that 11es, like a collar, across the northern shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Brie. Top spender The core of the Canadian economy, In fact, is a I I3Smlie stretch around the western end of Lake Ontario. Itq residents significantly account for nearly one-fifth of all retail sales In Canada. This so-called Golden Horseshoe runs from Oshawa with its auto-related industriel through the manufacturing metropolls of Toronto to Hamilton, the site of some of the most efficient steel plants In the world,andon to Niagara, where heavy industry competse for spac with honeymoon couples, Ontario, In short, Is the prime Canadian market for sellers to manufacturers, It's the province which ships from its plants more than 40% of Canada's fabricated metal products, 70% of the country's electrical goods, 59% of its chemicals and 50% of its primary metals. These made. in-Ontario shipments are each worth well over $1,0)00 million a year, while sales of transport. ation equipment and foods and beverages are both valued at almost $2,500 million annually. With manufacturing, mining and utility development currently booming all at once, businessand publicinstitutions in the province are spending heavily to expand and update facilities, SNIW t;ABI'IA I~pruuruurIIIY *Pr ION VIIA IO ONNCUINTlV O U11NINIh AND 61OV1I'NMINt IN G NIIAMO MONO CURNNY HI XIUA SM .

The' biggoest ad vance in spending will take place In primary metal refining motor vehicles, electrical products, non-metallic mineral products and in manufactur. ing. which accounts for more than one-quarter of all outlays in the province. Urban Market The industrial mix, combined with Toronto's commanding position as the country's finance and insurance capital, has made the province the number one consumer market of Canada, Ontario has only 34% or 6.8 million ofCanada's 20 million people, but its residents pull n 40% of total, Canadian personal income, Percapita income is the highest In the country-$2,300 vs. a national average of $1,990. After taxes, per capita Incomes In the province are 15% higher than the Canadian average. This is primarily an urban market. Nearly 2.4 million of Ontario's 2,6 million workers are In non-agricultural Jobs. In half a dozen of the province's leading cities, per capita spending on goods is one-ifth to two-fifthe higher than the all-Canada average, It adds up to an 18,000 millllon-a-year retail market, And beyond the province litelf are 80 million well-heeled Americans within a day's drive of the borderb For a irnt-hand look at this, the country's main manu. facturing market, fly direct to Toronto by Air Canada.

Au, cWCr ated witfr the Report ead Accoauts for the Jer edE 31st Marh, 1966. Production was 197 tons tin concentrates and 14 tons of columbite which compares with 224 tons and 17 tons for previous year. Sales amounted to 201 tons tin concentrates realising an average price of. Â£1,047 per ton (Â£1,426 metal equivalent) and 17 tons of columbite realising Â£475 per ton (Â£644 metal equivalent). Costs of production per ton of combined minerals shewed a further rise from Â£495 to Â£597 partly due to lower production, but primarily due to the continued upward trend in direct costs. Our overall profit of Â£13,156, however, compares with Â£31,383 and this fall was due. not only to reduced sales stemming from lower pro- duction coupled with increased costs, but also to the incidence of Government royalty. Your directors decided to pay an interim dividend of 7%R in February, 1966. A final dividend of 2%% is now recommended. Work continued throughout the year at Odegi on the examina- tion of the mineralised albite granites under the direction of our consulting geologists. The geological formations are proving to be extremely complex, and, on the information gained so far, it is still impracticable to form any firm conclusions about the geological nature of the relationships between the mineralised exposures and the surrounding granite. It has, however, become reasonably certain that the expectation of a large, but perhaps low grade, mineralised deposit at economic depth is unlikely to eventuate. This deduction, however does not preclude the possibility of the existence of a number of unrelated deposits being mined from the surface. Production from some of the deposits already located has already been in progress in recent years on a small scale. A pro- gramme bhas been agreed and has commenced for a final season of diamond drilling in order to obtain more information to a depth of 150 feet concerning the downward extension and mineralisation of sodme of the more encouraging discoveries to date.",

It has been shown eight times a day in the public -gallery been seen at least twice on television and been sent to numerous educational and commer- cial bodies, overseas stock exchanges and even some prisons.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE HAGUE, Sept. 6. THE DUTCH Government will appeal to the European Court at Luxembourg against the approval by the European Coal and Steel Community's High Authority of the special German rail freight iates for coal and steel products in the Saar area. In the view of the Dutch Government, the High Authority, by confirming these. rates, has infringed the ECSC Treaty. Generally known as the \" as if\" rates, these specially reduced German railway rates apply only to coal and steel transport between the Saar, the Ruhr, the German North Sea ports and Southern Germany. The Germans argued that the recent canalisation of the Moselle, Main and Neckar rivers, as a result of which the directly com- peting railway carriers were allowed, under ECSC rules, to lower their transport rates, put the coal and steel companies in the Saar under an un- fair disadvantage. In setting the disputed new rates, the German authorities projected the actual transport situation in the Moselle area on to the Saar area, \",as I\".:lg\"s .^ ,llisjnng,, the North-West Gemnan seaports with the Southern hinterland actually existed. The High Authority, while rejecting the theory of the \"as it\" system, nevertheless approved the reduced rates as a \" support measure \" for the German coal and steel industries. It added the condition, however, that the German railways. 'in order to avoid discrimination between the ECSC countries, should also apply these rates to the carriage across Germian territory of coal and steel from and to Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Lorraine. This con- dition is the subject of a recent German appeal to the European Court. Last month the Chambers of Com- merce of Holland's two leading ports, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, urged the Dutch Government to the appeal it has now decided on. The Chambers stated that the High Authority's reasons for its approval of Germany's reduced rates undermined the very basis of the rules of competition embodied in the ECSC Treaty and confirmed in several: European Court judgments. The Dutch Chambers fear that this would open the way to a system in which national transport rates are used to further the interests of particular industriy , .orta .pad ,aaqoqixpsWrt;s. *",

   "text_content" : "By Our Soviet CorrespeOadqt . THE COMECON countries will no longer be able'to satisfy their oil requirements within their own area by 1980, according to a prominent Polish economic journalist. In an article published in the Polish paper ZAP (Western Press Agency), Mr. Stanislaw Albinowski analyses the fuel balance of Comecon member countries. He says that it will be purposeful to consider the possibilities of oil im- ports from zones outside the frame- work of Comecon. Although the fuel resources of the Comecon countries are considerable, says Mr. Albinowski, some 90 per cent. of these reserves are deposits in the Soviet Union, with solid fuels prevailing. The Soviet Union has 8,700,000m. tons of coal and only 28,000m. tons of oil. The extraction of one ton of coal is 20 times more expensive than the amount of natural gas with the same calorific value, and six times more expensive than the extraction of crude oil. The entire world economy is turn- ing to oil and the Comecon countries are relatively poor as concerns oil, Mr. Albinowski points out. Calcula- tions thow that in 1980 there will be a deficit of 100m. tons of oil in the Comecon countries other than the Soviet Union. Although the possi- bilities for further increasing oil out- put in the Soviet Union are large, it will not be able to cover the other Comecon countries' deficit. Hence, there will be a need to import \" several tens of millions \" of tons a year of crude oil from other countries."

Of the Ordater Paris of the year 2000 now being planned, M. Delouvrier will be the Oew Baron . Haussatian. Trained as an economist and administrator, but combining the expertise of the technician with a flair for statesmanship and action under fire, the 52-year-old Delouvrier with his bairline moustache is one of the most bril- liant and versatile civil servants post-war France has produced. Top grades When a young Frenchman becomes Inspecteur des Finances with the top grades for the year in the gruelling annual competitive examinations. he is not likely to be a failure in life, but Delouvrier's career has been particularly impressive. Fresh out of the war- time Resistance he joined the .staff of the first Finance Minister of the Provisional Government, and was later chief of staff to two other Finance Ministers (Rend Pleven and Rend Mayer), head of the financial department of the Plan, Vice Director General for Taxes, and Secretary General of the Government Commission for 'European Economic Co- operation. His career then took a strongly European turn, and through the mid-1950s he was director of the financial division of the European Coal-Steel Authority.

Controversy But the large-scale French administrative and territorial .re- form now under way has produced a number of glaring hesitancies and equivocations. There had been wide., agreement for years that France's Napoleonic division into some .90 ddpartements was no longer adequate for the speed and. scale of modern transportation, population shifts and, above all, economic planning. But it wasn't until 1964, with a new cabinet portfolio for administrative.referm and Baron Olivier Guichard as head of a powerful Government department for territorial planning,. that France was redivided into 21 new \" rdgions de Programme, \"each under the command of a regional prefect. The particularly complex question -of Paris was put aside for two years, but the 1964 decrees instituted the 20 provincial regions -each grouping two to eight of the old ddpartements. But the d6partements continued to- exist . And from the start there was heated controversy on a quite elementary question: was the prefect of the region the true head of a new administrative entity or' the mere co-ordinator of inter- departmental services? Were the departmental prefects his subor- dinates? Who gave orders to whom? Or. was the separation of powers between the two networks to be so minutely scrupulous as to avoid all conflict? Actually there was a very basic separation of powers between the two systems. The new regions had been created because of the pres- I sure of largescale reional econo- e mkic planning and th.$* functions, I in theory, were to be liaSted to this domain. All routine admini- astration-police, taxes, schools- r was still to be handled on the t1 r ,epartmental level. c But France's departmental ad- i ministrators, hostile to the new t I isystem in any case were not over- ti t.fond of a fastidious separation of P .powers eifhr. They were left with all the thankless obs of routine a -administration while the new i regions set up all the glamour pro- t jets, \"building the Fiance of to-morrow.\" Fr \"two yeart the t 'Government-sidestepped the bier- b archical problem by a \" person a -union\" formula. The prefect of t the central department of each new I region was also appointed prefect of the region and wortwo hats. i Colossal job But this June, to a chorus of t protests in the corridors of the s t Ministry of the Interior, the Prime * Minister, M. Georges Pompidou, announced , that a progressive t separation of ina from depart- mental prefects wa ion the cards. And now, two and a-half months t later, the Government has ap- pointed the first independent prdfet de region-the prestigious M. Delouvrie. . Decrees setting up the new super- a prefecture of the Paris Region were v f published simultaneously, giving the prefect greater authority than F the regional prefects of the pro- 1 vinces and a rank-heavy indepen- 1I dent headquarters staff. But they still, did not stipulate the exact e hierarchical relationship between * the new Greater Paris prefect and a ' the departmental prefects within r his region. No one \\doubts, of course, that t with M. Delouvrier's weight he will a in fact exercise authority over the t f departmental prefectures. But it c can be seen that once again-as in t Algeria-he is being thrown into a a job of great importance and c flexible, loosely defined limits. In t a way curious for a civil servant, a the new prefect is clearly expected I to use his prestige and talents to I establish himself as well as his Region. But even apart fomthe ambi- uities of administrative reform elouvrier's job-the building the Paris of the year 2000-is a colossal one. Paris of the year 1966 is strangling, with a popula- tion of 9m. By. 2000 its popula- tion will be at least 14m. and possibly quite a bit more i the Government's efforts at decentrali- sation fail to counter the lemming* like drive of so many Frenchmen towards their capital Last year, while still in his transi- tional post as delegate general, M. Delouvrier published an ambitious and far-sighted work, the much talked about Schdma Directeur (master plan) for the expansion of Paris in the remain- ing three and a-half decades of the century. Bold and imaginative, the plan calls for the expansion of Paris in only one direction, along the valley of the Seine towards the sea-but on a vast scale. The axis of development is over 50 miles. Urban centres The basic idea is to space out two parallel strings of new urban centres on either side of the Seine -eight in all, with a population of up to Im. apiece-and to leave around them great areas' of greenery, while linking the centre with a first-class transport network. The new Greater Paris will be a polycentric city-country complex in the shape of a long, and ever longer, rectangle. But now the plan must be executed. It is General de Gaulle's dream to leave behind him a new and bigger and better France, richer and more powerful, equipped with healthy, stable poli- tical institutionst But history would give the General a black mark if the Paris that Rimbaud fervently called \"The holy city, capital of the occident\" were to be asphyxiated by its own expansion or if the General failed to build for the future a new, original Paris as appropriate to the 21st century as Rimbaud's Paris was to the 19th.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent ISTANBUL. Seat. 6. TALKS ARE going on in Ankara concerning a possible S50m. long- term Japanese credit for the con, struction of four new shipyards at Izmir, Istanbul, Golcuk and on the Black Sea Coast. In addition the possibility of Japanese colla- boration in the setting up of a marine diesel engine plant is being discussed. According to a recent statement by the Turkish Minister of Com- munications, the proposed yards would each be capable of building vessels of at least 25,000 dead- weight tons, and the overall invest- ment in the yards would be some Â£T1,000m. (Â£40m.). Turkey's present shipyards, nine in all, are for the most part antiquated and small; the largest and most modern is owned by the Admiralty and is therefore unable to give priority to merchant ships. Out-dated ships At least one-third of all major Turkish-flag vessels are out-dated and need to be replaced but, with the exception of the State Maritime Line and its subsidiaries, owners find it ISTANBUL, Sept. 6. difficult to finance replacements. It follows, therefore, that the scheme now under consideration would be a viable proposition only if a substan- tial and regular volume of export orders sould Â·be assured. - Labour is plentiful and relatively cheap but -it will be some years before local output of steel is suffi- cient to maintain ai telatively large shipbuilding industfy.' Modern pro- duction techniques are also lacking. It is too early yet to forecast the outcome of the Ankara talks but it would seem that they must concern a major Japanese investment of \"know-now\" and an assurance of export orders as well as a straight forward credit."

Turkey's imports for the first half-year totalled S358m., or an nultui rate of S716m., only S9m. below se plannes target for the year. This record rate of imports has been pohieved by increased imports of capital suilpmsent and vehicle assuemblies which is In line with the improved Investment climate. Britain's share of the halfyear's total was S40.4m. (f14.4m., or 11.3 per cent. of the total; this compared with a JanuaryJune, 1965, total of $26.1m. (9 per cent of imports from all sources). Growing market Although delays in the issue and use of import licences make balanced forecasts impossible, the full year's imports from Britain should approximate-and quite possibly exceed-the all-time record of S77.1m. established in 1963. Encouraging though these figures may be, the Businessmen's Mission, which has beeh organised by the British Chamber of Com- merce of Turkey, with the support of the BNEC, has already learned that Britain is still not taking the maximum advantage of the oppor- tunities which this now rapidly developing market has to offer. Broken delivery promises con- tinue to be a serious deterrent to more orders being placed in the United Kingdom and, in the main, British capital equipment manufac- turers are still not appreciative of the fact that tenders receive more favourable consideration if they minimise foreign exchange expen- diture by the incorporation of locally produced' parts and com- ponents wherever feasible. Offers of \"know-how\" and technical assistance in the setting. up and ISIANBUL, ept. 6. initial operation of new plants are often lacking, too. In recent months it has become increasingly clear that British manufacturers have largely ignored the now rapidly growing demand here for i manufaoturing '\"kow-how\" and Ilensing agreements. In act, too many British manufacturers still lack first-hand knowledge of the market's opportunaltise-and diffi- culties. Encouraging visit Ta this context, the presence of the Businessmen's Mission isen- couraging and so is the fact that over 220 British manufacturers are represented in the 1966 British pavilion at Izmir. For the most part, their products are importable -admittedly to a strictly limited extent-under the Global Import Quota system and these exhibitors u have benefited from special Fair import allocations totalling some 5215,000. Nevertheless, there is also es attractive display of goods and pro- ducts which old a useful potential for the future-when Turkey's foreign exchange position is less critical. The motor industry, which usually contributes some 60 per a* cent. of all British exports to Turkey, is particularly well repre- sented in the pavilion, with exhibits from BMC, Leyland, Rootes. Massey-Ferguson, Perkins, Lucas, Ford and Simms, to name only a few of this industry's exhibitors. ICI has prepared an exception- ally fine display, too: this has an added attraction because ICI is supplying the \" know-how \" for the initial two stages of Turkey's first petro-chemicals complex - with Simon-Carves and Humphrey and '( Glasgow providing the plant and machinery with the assistance of a Â£3m.

ZAMBIA'S DECISION to with- draw from Central African Airways marks another stage in the disintegration of the common services of the disbanded Federa- tion of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It coincides with the continued work by Rhodesia Railways on drawing up a plan for an \"orderly dissolution\" of the jointly-owned railway system and also with the growing speculation about future plans for Kariba because of Rhodesian-Zambian friction on the building of stage two of the Kariba power project. There is nothing surprising in Zambia's decision to call for an orderly dissolution of CAA, though it will be interesting to see whether Malawi will also want to opt out of the CAA group. Last year, while both Air Rhodesia and Zambia Airways made a profit, Air Malawi ran at a loss so that there would be an incentive for it to remain linked with one or other of the two groups which will emerge from the dissolution. It is quite clear that the frag- mentation of the group will reduce all-round financial benefits, though this has been apparent for some time now since Zambia announced its intention of buying BAC One- Eleven aircraft for its own use. On the power front, while Rhodesia has agreed in principle to go ahead with stagb two of Kariba, Zambia has not. Indeed, Mr. Banda, Zambia's Minister of Transport and Works, has already warned that instead Zambia will begin work on the Kafue scheme. Stage two Of Kariba was due to get under way this year and the first generator was due to be la operation' 'by 1970, _ew poPr, generators I W ,MU would be installed on the north bank of the dam, but so long as Zambia refuses to recognise the Rhodesian Ministers there cannot even be any discussion of the Kariba extension. In Rhodesia there has been discus- sion about the development of thermal power .in the southern half of the country based on coal deposits in the Rhodesian lowveld. It is argued that thermal power could be exported to South Africa to serve Northern SALISBURY, Sept. 6. Transvaal so that failure to press ahead with stage two of Kariba would not be as serious a problem as might have been thought. On the railway front, the immei diate problem is staff recruiting by the Zambian section of the system. Rhodesia Railways personnel teams will be in Britain next week pro- ceasing inquiries as more than 700 applications have been. received for about 350 jobs."

THE INDIAN Government to-day announced its decision to constitute a monopolies and restrictive trade practices commission as a statu- tory body with certain compulsory and advisory powers. A Government resolution tabled in Parliament said that the neces- sary legislation would be sponsored \" as early as possible.\" While the appointment of the commission follows recommenda- tions in the monopolies report sub- mitted last year, the Government has departed from the major re- commendation and decided that the .permanent commission will func- tion only in an advisory capacity.

It will have powers for investigations and some unspecified purposes in connection with \" monopolistic practices so far as the prevention of undue concentration of econo- mic power is concerned.\" In other matters, concerning the concentration of whole industries, the statutory commission's, advice would help the Government and the law courts to exercise existing legal provisions to determine crucial questions regarding diversification, expansion and amalgamations. To-day's decisions represent a compromise between the extreme views held by members of the Con- gress Party party executive which had at one stage recently blocked the Governments proposals for setting up a statutory dommission.",

Although Pyongyang criticised both Peking's \"dogma- tism ' asl( Moscow's \"revision- ism,\" the denuncialtion was directed more to Peking, articularly at its extremist attitude in the Sino-Soviet dispute, which it said is blocking a united Communist front against \"imperialist aggression\" in Viet- nam.. The editorial has naturally led to a host of speculations. Some observers, especially Western, be- lieve that Pyongyang is definitely moving ifto an independent line, similar to one being followed by Rumania. or Yugoslavia. But the Seoul Government, and. most South Koreans, disagree with this view. They maintain that Pyong- yan's latest statement nals its fin break With Chin a a move towards. Riula.

Peking's resources, ho*ever, I were too thinly spread for Kim to , count on Chinese help permanently He therefore slowly began to look toward Moscow and, when Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited Pyongyang following his trip to Hanoi and Peking in February:,| last year, he agreed to take a \" neutral stand \" in the Sino-Soviet dispute in exchange for resumed -I Russian aid. During the 18 months it since then, Pyongyang has kept silent on the feud and increased exchanges of visits with Russia, ; despite Chinese.objections. Moscow in turn resumed aid.

The Chinese attacked him for his drift from Peking, and domestic critics attacked him for his vacillation between the two -Communist powers. To fight off such criticism and justify his stand, Kim apparently felt the need for an official declaration of \"indepen- dence.\" This portends a pure .of his critics, especially pro-Chinese \" dogmatists,\" probably at the Con- ference of Party Representatives due to be held this month.

The next .-.*-.- e the Company wIll therefore be made up for the thirteen months ending 30th AprII. 1037 Only four months of this period has aso far elapsed but. on the basis of turnover to date and courrent orders on hand, the Directora are of the opinion that. In the absence of untoreseen circumstance. profits before tax of the Company for the thirteen months ending 30th April. 1307, will amount to not les than $100.,000 substantlially the whole of which Is expected to be contributed by tIs Mountain Group. The Dlrectors consider that the Selectlive Emploment Tax will have a marginally banaclit effent on the profits of the Company and the Mountain Group. It i anticipated that some exceptional stock losses may be s*uered by The Lelgh Mills Company Limited In the thirteen months ending 130th April. 1967. a a result of stolck being reduced to levers of optimum efciency. It is the Directors' Intention to write off asuch losses against the stock contingency reserve which stood In the Company's books at 80.000 on 31st March, 10966 and which the Directors consider willht sufcient for the purpose. Mr. Hall and Mr, Cleag hav executed a deed covenanting to waive all dividends on their shares declared In respect of each of the three years ending 30th April. 1906. This covenant is conditional on there being no Intervening fiscal legislatlon which would result In them or the Company suffering a fiscal disablllty as a resuit of their waivers being put Into effect.

   "text_content" : ",LIMITED SALES ANDi PROFITS REACH RECORD LMYE. MR. ALFRED W. JEFFS ON GROUP'S EXPORT ACHIEVEMENT The 80th Annual General meeting of John Shaw & Sons., Wolverhampton, Limited was held on September 6 in Wo)vert hampton, Ma. ALatn W. JaneS (the Chairman) presiding. ; Mr,,D. 'A. Tandy (Director and Secretary) read the notice convening the meeting and Mr. A. It. Hore, .C.A., represewttg. the auditors, Mess. Felton & Co.. read the report of his firm. The following is the statement by the Chairman which had been circulatpd with the report and accounts: I have pleasure in presenting the Eightieth Annual Report of the Directors and Statement of Accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1966. When I reported to you last year, I stated that owing to the continued rise m wages and general costs, we should only be able to maintain our profit by a substantial increase iv prqductivity. I am happy to inform you that as a result of our policy of keeping. our plant and factories in the highest state of efficiency, the turn-' over proved a record. The Group Trading Profit of Â£640,385 shows an increase of Â£48,441, which is also a record for your Company. The profit before taxation is Â£568,514, compared with Â£512,294 last year, an increase of Â£56,220. Taxation this year takes Â£225,125 against Â£280,068 last year, but these figures are not comparable owing to the basic change in the method of taxation, the effect of which has been to reduce the taxation on the profits of the year, but we shall now have to. pay in cash the tax deductible from our proposed dividend. Your Board have transferred Â£100,000 to General Revenue Reserve, and this action requires your confirmation. It was originally proposed to recommend a dividend of 17Y4%. I would add that this proposal was made and announced prior to the issue of the Prime Minister's Statement on the Government's Economic Policy. In view, however, of the request for a dividend freeze, it will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of 15% be declared-this is the same as last year. It it, however, the intention of your Board to recommend a further payment of 22%% when circumstances permit. In the last six years, our shareholders have had only one increase in dividend and, in normal circumstances, the increase originally proposed would have been fully justified, both by the earnings of the Com- pany and its financial position. The Accounts now before you present the picture based on a 170 % distribution, and for the sake of clarity, therefore, I give you the revised figures as related to the dividend of 15% now pro- posed:- 1%6 1965 Â£ Â£ Group Profit after Taxation ............ 343.389 232.226 Add brought forward from last year ... 270,004 237.413 613393 469,639 Deduct Transfer to General Reserve ... 100,000 100,000 513,393 369,639 Deduct: Â£ Â£ Proposed Dividend of 15% less Income Tax ......... 99,635 99,635 Income Tax deductible from the proposed Dividend and payable to the Inland Revenue ......... ....69,957 - 169,592- 99,635 Balance carried forward to next year: Parent Company ............ 192,709 140,200 Subsidiary Companies ...... 151,092 129,804 --343,801- 270,004 Export Sales SI am pleased to report that the Group sales for the year again pr6ved a recdrd In both hbme and export markets. The fact that this record was achieved is largely due to the efforts put in by Management and workers alike, our travelling representatives in the field and our agents abroad. To them all, I would epress sincere thanks for their efforts and not the least to our customers and disributors for their continued support. We are proud of our export achievement, and you will be interested to learn that our direct exports amount to some 35% of our turnover. This does not include indirect exports of our products, which we know must be appreciable. Foreign competi- tion is met in practically all markets of the world but we are determined to maintain, and if possible increase, our share of the available business. To this end our Executive Directors are con- stantly visiting the major overseas markets in support of our agents and representatives, but the vital task is to ensure quick deliveries of quality tools at the right price. Order Book Poltios At the present time, we are beset with so many uncortaintles that there is little I.can say regarding future prospects. The Industry remains highly competitive, costs continue to rise, and we are till experiencing difficulties in recruiting sufficient skilllw labour. I can, however, say that turnover in the first three months of the current year has been maintained, and we commenced the year with an excellent order book. Our e*port trade has unfor- tunately suffered during the last two months owing to the seamen's strike, and it Is tragic that as a result of this disaster, we should be in danger of losing the goodwill we have with our customers overseas. Plans are In hand for the extension of our factory In Shefield, and for the introduction of additional new plant and equipment Whether we shall reive the necessary Oovernmmnt permission to complete our programme nmalis to b seen but your Board will mdeavour to surmount any difoulties which may arise. The report and acsecounts wen adopted and the proposed dividend of 1p% approved. The ntirlng director, Mr. D. A. Tandv. was reeeted, ad the remuneration of the auditors, Messrs. Pelt6n A Co., was duly fxed, al o~~eiZiwirisis the statement by the Ctiairman which. brhi been circuiatvd wilth theÂ· report and accounts: I nave pleasure in presenting the Eightieth Annual Repot of the Directors and Statement of Accounts for the yeai ended 31stt WhenI reorte to you 19At year, I stoated-that owing to the continued rise in wapes and general costs. we'should only be iable to maintain our profit by 4 substantial increase in grqductivity.

   "text_content" : "FARNBOROUGH, Sept. 6, The Hawker Siddeley Group had a good day at the Air Show here to-day, with new contracts for aircerft and cafellths worth Is all nearly Â£7a3. The most signiicant sales announcement by Hawker-$iddeley Aviation was a letter of intent for 10 HS-148 airliners from Varig. the Braziliaq airline, worth around Â£5m. including spares, for delivery through 1967, with the possibility of a further four or fiv.e aircraft being ordered through 1968. nvye a&crats Dems oraOrea xtrou This order, when made firm, will bring total sales of HS-748s to date to 140, worth over Â£70m. including pares the majority for export. Officis of Hawker Siddeley Avia- tion' to whom I spoke here to-day sugsested that throughout Central and South America there were further potential sales of around 50 748s over the next two years. Hawker Siddeley Aviation also revealed that it had won orders for a furthet five of its small HS-125 executive Jet, worth Â£11m. including spares, bringing the total sales of this aircraft to date to 113, worth well ovar Â£30m. including spares. Of this total 84 aircraft are for export, includi 65 aircraft for North Americ Further orders for both the 748 and 125 are now in negotiation. Dynamics & Intelsat Hawker Siddeley Dynamics, the saace subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley Group, revealed that it had been selected as a member of an inter- national consortium of 11 companies that will build 24 satellites for the initial global communications satellite system Intelsat. Intelsat itself -is the' organisation formed by 52 countries to run this global \"Comsat\" system with the U.K. having a 7.6 per cent. share. The initial satellite system is to be launched in 1968 but by early 1969 Intelsat has to decide on plans for a permanent world communications satellite system. The prime contractor for this initial world Comsat system will. be Thomson-RamoWooldrdge (TRW) of the United States. A a first step, the consortium will build six satel- lites, of which two will be the respon- sibility of Hawker Siddeley Dynamics. Whie the value of the initial deal to TRW. is $32m. (over Â£film.) Hawker Siddeley's share is around half a million dollars. It seems likely that the U.K. company will win a further substantial share of the re- maining 18 satellites that will have to be built for the interim system. It also ensures that the U.K. com- pany is in a strong position to bid for contracts for the ultimate per- I i I I r I I j I I r I r r manent world communications satel- lite system when this is established in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While these new contracts help to ensure a continuing high level or work for Hawker Siddeley Aviation. it is also revealed here that work on the Anglo-French Jaguar jet strike trainer aircraft is going well. Some new information was given here to-day about this aircraft by the British Aircraft Corporation, which is the U.K. partner on the project along with Breguet of France. It was revealed. for example, that the BAC is building the rear fuselage and the wing sections of the Jaguar at its Preston division, while Breguet is undertaking the nose, cockpit and forward fuselage. To date. over 1,000 production drawings have been released to the manufacturing shops on both sides of the Channel.- and metal is now being 'cut. The first flight of the first prototype is set for 1968 and the aircraft'is expected to enter squadron service with the Royal Air Force and the French Air Force in the early 1970s. As already announced, the engine i, the RB-172/T260. built jointly by Rolls-Royce and* Turbomeca of France. \"Blind\" Landing According to reports circulating at Farnborough. there is already growing foreign interest in the Jaguar pro- gramme, with Japanese currently particularly interested. The export potential of the Jaguar is reported to be particularly good, and both the BAC and Breguet are hoping to sell the aircraft in large numbers in the years ahead. It was also announced by the BAC here to-day that substantial progress has been made on the provision of \"blind landing\" capability in both the VC-10 and One-Eleven jet air- liners. Automatic landing trials with the Super VC-10 began in July, and a fully equipped aircraft capable of automatic landing is due to go into service with BOAC next year. At the same time, trials are also in progress on a One-Eleven jet airliner aimed at giving it improved all- weather landing performance, and this programme is expected to be com- pleted by the end of this year. .--Â·Â·",

   "text_content" : "BY AN OVERWHELMING j majority the TUC yesterday de- manded the restoration of com- pulsory arbitration machinery- but it went on to insist that arbi- tration tribunals be independent of Government influence and should be seen to be independent. Moving the motion Mr. Greville Hawley, President of the National Union of Vehicle Builders, said that Congress should be concerned at the lack of progress in securing Government agreement that legis- lation was needed to provide an arbitration tribunal on the lines of the 1951 Industrial Disputes Order. Mr. Hawley insisted that the resolution had not arisen because of the wage freeze. How- ever, Mr. Harry Nicholas, assistant 'general secretary of the Transport snd General Workers' Union, seized the opportunity to make some strong criticisms of the incomes policy. Not Much Point Mr. Nicholas said there was not much point in arbitration if the verdict was known in iadvance. \"This is one of the effeets of the incomes policy. I hope we all realise the damage done if one of 4he safety valves is taken away.\" Mr Nicholas went on to elabor- ate his union's view that regional arbitration bodies-on the lines of Mr. Jack Scam 's Motor Industry Joint Labour Council-should be ready to10 go into action immediatel a dispute arose and give thr 'verdict within seven days. \"Wv call this instant justice,\" he said. Mr. Nicholas added a warning that If no alternative to strikes was found they would have to he accepted when they occurred. \"Those who make very sancti- monious speeches about strikes should remember that it was a Conservative Government in 1950 which abandoned the arbitration procedure built up during the Despite Mr. Nicholas's emphasis on the political side of the motion, r.

Iaold Wilson, who opened the, deba*t, -yesterday afternoon with a 70-mlnsu . efence.Of Bdb policy, made only the, brefest openin mention of the newT Cape Town, but the African dele- gates. after the initial shock, were trying in the corridors to assess its effect on the Rhodesian problem. At the suggestion of President Obote of Uganda the conference was adjourned until this morning after Mr. Wilson had spoken. Although the British delegation argued that this move by the Africans was a tribute to the amount of food for thought which Mr. Wilson had given them, it is more likely that they wanted time to reflect on the consequences of the Verwoerd assassination. Whitehall's Feeling * In a message from 10, Downing Street. Mr. Wilson has asked Dr. DOnges, the acting Prime Minister, to accept the British Government's condolences, and to convey its sympathy to Dr. Verwoerd's family. These are more than formal regrets; the feeling in Whitehall could be summed up: \" Dr. Verwoerd was the best South African Prime Minister we had.\" In other words, Dr. Verwoerd, while refusing to boycott the Smith regime, had shown a lively sense of international realities during the Rhodesian crisis and had sought to avoid a head-on collision with Britain. There is little confidence that his successor will be equally immune from domestic political pressures to step up South African' help to Rhodesia. The African Prime Ministers hasv alan rvnraccA rsl rarrft fnr fr Verwoerd as a is tbing, but they tend to regard h hap ned as a warning to South trica itself and to of the possibility of violent oppositidn to repressive rgimes based on aqial inequalit* Dr. Verwoerwd' deh wilt cer tainly do nothing to abate the African leaders' demand for man- datory sanctions against Rhodesia and, after a decent interval, they are likely to seize on any signs of weakness in the South African leadership as an argument for pres- in their case. In his speech Mr. Wilson went so far as to agree to discuss manda- tory sanctions later in the con. ference, although he was careful not to commit himself to taking a view about them. But his main point was to unveil two proposals or increased aid to Zambia, which were first reported in Tue FINANCUIA TIMEs. First. Britain has offered to in- crease her aid to Zambia from about Â£9m. to some Â£14m. between now and the end of June, 1967, if the Rhodesian crisis continues until then--as' there seems little doubt that it will. Secondly, Britain has proposed that the Commonwealth-meaning other members besides herself-- should provide an airlift and ground transport for Zambia, in terms either of vehicles or of cash to buy them. A response from Commonwealth Governments has been awaited for weeks. Object of Aid Mr. Wilson pointed out that the object of this aid to Zambia was to allow her to \"escalate\" her own sanctions against Rhodesia, by gradually cutting off more and more of her imports from Rho- desia. But Zambia has not yet replied to the British offer, and may not do so until President Kaunda, ow. how the confereoue'- debate on Rhodesia tunrs out. aTheA iaM intend to pres Mr. for an aspurance lhat iagdot grant Rho' desia independence before majority rule bai been achieved. But he carefully avoided comnitting him- self on this point yesterday. The Rhodesia debate will con- tinue to-day, and probably to- morrow as well, and the con, ference is also due to debate South Africa itself. One of the main themes of Mr. Wilson's speech was his insistence that he was sincere in his Rho- desian policy; no doubt the aid offers to Zambia were intended to bring the point home. The in- sistence of the Africans that Mr. Wilson should remain in the chair, after his offer to stand down for the Rhodesia debate, is taken by British sources as a sign that the Africans accept that he is sincere Seeking Proofs But the Africans are looking for more tangible pyoofs of Mr. Wil- son's sincerity; Dr. Vetwoerd's death may temporarily have dis- tracted them from their task, but it may also make them take It up again with redoubled vigour. Some Prime Ministers are already trying to mediate between Mr. Wilson and the Africans. Yester- day Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Malayzian Prime Minister, said they must look at Rhodesia from the British angle. They must ask whether the action they proposed to take would not seriously involve Britain in domestic trouble to the extent of bringing about the down- fall of the British Government. But whatever might be thought of Britain or of Mr. Wilson's Gov- ernment, it should not be made a reason for breaking up the associa- tion of nations. \" If we have to vent our wrath, let's take it out of Britain and not out of the Com- monwealth.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Our Foreign Staff THE LATEST estimate in White- hall is that the total trade embargo sought by the U.K. against Rho- desia is now working more effectively than at any time since Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence. This is believed to have been part of a detailed account Mr. Wilson save the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference yester- day of the effects of sanctions against Rhodesia. His account is understood to have touched on a number of the following points:- 75% of Exports The Smith regime is now thought to be in acute difficulty over tobacco, sugar, and pig-iron, which between them account for 75 per cent. of Rhodesia's exports to countries outside South Africa. On tobacco, the Tobacco Cor- poration is believed to be buying most of the crop at the reserve price. The Corporation is deliberately downgrading the tobacco brought in by the farmers, who as a result are getting an average price below the promised support price of 2s per pound, It is estimated that one-third of the tobacco farmers are likely to go out of business by the end of the year. The Buyers Officials In Whitehall do not believe that more than a quarter of the crop will be genuinely sold. South Africa may take up to 40m. Ibs (out of a total of 250m.). but there is absolutely no evidence of re-exports from South Africa. Switzerland will also take about 3m. lbs, the same as last year, but the Swiss authorities have said they will not allow this flgure to be extceded. The only other leakages in the tobacco sanctions dyke are small purchases by individual Dutch and aorman merchants. The fear that quantitles of tobacco might be moved through Beira has been allayed by the BeIrn statistics for June, when 7,000 tos were shipped. compared with 50000 last ear. Take away the Zambian and Malawl tobacco exports. It is clear that,scarely any R odslan tobacco from this year's crop was exported through Beira in June. The Salisbury Government has, of course, tried to reassure the tobacco farmers by announcing a planned crop of 200m. Ibs next year and a higher reserve price. But it is believed that a member of the regime has privately admitted that this announcement was a gamble in the belief that sanctions would no longer be operatiig In 167i. . ; As regards sugar, the Smith rigime has sold 30,000 tons of refined sugar to Mozambique and 5-15.000 tons to Portugale-this out of an annual production of. 250,000 tons. One example of the s:actions campaign's success was the cancellation of a 50,000-ton consignment by Japan. As a result the sugar industry is in great difficulties. The regime has even been offering sugar at the very depressed price of Â£14 a ton and finding no takers. Pig Iron Similarly, pig iron Is being offered at Â£12 a ton, against a world price of Â£24. Mexico and Peru have bought a certain amount, but these loopholes have now been closed, The Rhodesian Iron and Steel Corporation (Risco) is reported to have reopened two blast furnaces which, were shut down in December, but it is felt all the same that the problem of finding markets Is worsening all the time, even when products are offered at less than production. costs.

These supply a special fluid in the form of a fine spray to ensure first-class visibility whea the aircraft is landing. Ash-in-Coal Monitor Development has been com- pleted of a monitor based on the analysis of radiation which is capable of measuring the ash content of coal whether or not it contains large amounts of iron like much of Britain's and Western Europe's coal. The unit consists of a source of radiation which is a zirconium/tritium (radioactive hydrogen) device. The radiation is absorbed, altered and re- emitted by the different com- pounds in the coal sample to give an X-ray spectrum faith- fully reflecting the composition of the sample. This technique, known as X-ray backscattering, has per- mitted the development of equipment many thousands of pounds cheaper hban the con. ventional X-ray systems in use for the purpose and in the U.K. alone there is a market running into the millions of pounds since it provides what is prob. ably the simplest way of main- taining a continuous check on coal quality.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter Prices of Britain's imports declined in July to the figure of March. this year. Figures released yesterday by the Board of Trade show that the overall import unit value index fell one point to 109. The export index Increased by a % per cent. although this was not reflected. in the rounded figure. which remained at 113. The terms of trade rose by 1 point to a new high of 104. All the indices are based on 100 in 1961. The average values of imorted fruit and vegetables fell in Ju from their seasonally high levels Spast few months. This fall and a drop in the average value of imported bacon contributed most to the fall of about 3 per cent. in the food. beverages and tobacco index. There were also declines of 2 per cent in the imported fuels index which is now about 7 per cent. below its average level in 1 65 and of 14 per cent. in basic materials. The manufactured goods prices increased by 1 per cent.-mainly as a result of higher average values of imported copper. there were rises in July of almost I per cent. in the export unit value index for non-manufactured goods and about a 4 per cent. for manu- factures. Within the manufactured class, there were increases in machinery and transport equipment prices of a + per cent. and in metals of nearly 1 per cent. These were partly offset by a fall of 1 per cent, in the textiles index. The Board of Trade reports that Svlu of trade In July was still dfstorted by the effects of the sea' men's strike. Because of the varyina time-lag in compiling Import and export statistics, the July figures include exports which took place before the strike ended on July 1, The import figures represent more closely the movement of goods in July after the strike was over. \"Although exports in July were still affected by delays caused by the strike, the seasonallv adjusted volume of total exports was substantially higher than the low June fgure and was approaching the prc-strike level. The recovery gave increases In volume in all the main commodity groups.\" states the Board of Trade.",

   "text_content" : "THE ASSASSINATION of the South African Prime Minister has so shocked his country that it may be some time before its consequences begin to become clear. Dr. Verwoerd's personal authority was great, and it cut across the boundaries of party: there is nobody of remotely simi- Jar stature to replace him. Some people outside South Africa, in- deed, may jump to the conclu- sion that his death must lead to a weakening of the apartheid policies for which he stood. The country will now, they may argue, come under the control of leaders less inflexible and more ready to respect opinion in the world outsidq. Not an extremist There is reason to suspect that this is a superficial and mislead- ing point of view. Dr. Verwoerd was not, by South African standards, an extremist. There were many to the left of him, in- side and outside his own party, * who regarded various aspects of his policy as impracticable. But there were also many to the right of him, who regarded his plans for separate development as over-liberal and over-extrava- gant. The left, given time, might eventually have thrown up an alternative to the expected suc- cessor, the Minister of Justice, Mr. Vorster. But it has not been given time. Whether the actual successor to Dr. Verwoerd is Mr. Vorster or some less controver- sial figure, he is likely to come from the right. The circumstances in which he comes to office may them- selves incline him towards more extreme policies. The very fact that he will lack the special authority of his predecessor and will have to work for political support, moreover, may push him further in the same direc- tion. In South Africa itself this could conceivably lead to a reduction in expenditure on separate African development, still more vigorous measures of repression, and an even greater drive to make the country self- sufficient and relatively proof against economic sanctions. Abroad, It could mean a greater readiness to defy world opinion and risk, the worst that the United Nations can do. This possibility has an obvious relevance to the situa- tion in Rhodesia. Dr. Verwoerd may not have wished to see the Smith regime defeated once the unilateral declaration of in- dependence had beea\"made; but he did not welcome UDI, realising that his own country had probably more 'to lose than to gain from involvement in Rhodesiap :affairs. Despite the enthusiastic support of his party (and of most of the white popu- lation of South Africa) for the Smith Government, he was care- ful to give it only limited and discreet assistance. Even this was bad enough.. Other African countries had already decided that Mr. Wilson's policy of sanctions was- unlikely to be effective while South Africa and Portugal re- fused to co-operate in. it, and pressure to demand mandatory sanctions at the United Nations was growing. Now, however, there is a possibility that a new South African prime minister, more responsive to the emotions of his party supporters and less sensitive to the niceties of diplo- macy, may agree to support Rhodesia on a scale andin a manner which throws the two countries - inextricably together and leaves no room for doubt that action against one is imprac- ticable without action against the other. Pahintil dilemma If this were to happen, respon- sibility for dealing with the Rho- desiaui crisis would be finally out of Britain's hands and the Government's dilemma would become much more painful than it is at present. This, of course, is no more than speculation. The only thing that is immediately certain is that the- Common- wealth prime ministers cannot now hold a useful discussion about Rbodesia, pimply because they do not know how the situa. tion in southern Africa will de- velop. The balance of proba. bility, however, is that the situa- tion has, from Britain's point of view, 'taken a turn for the worse.",

It is true that the volume Index rose again to its old sticking point of 110, but this was only achieved thanks to a boomlet In sales of drinks and electrical goods..

   "text_content" : "1Byl JOBÃ½ RO~AL t s s D r ,a if 0. Di. aENDRIK F. VER- . D WOERD, who was bornm in lolland of Dutch * parents in IQA1 became the most d pow.rful father-figurete Afri- kaner peopl of South Africa P have ever klown. He gave an intellectual backing to their v traditlopal policy of keeping separate ifron the Africans and ruling over them; he built his t Republic up to the greatest pitch a of strength in its history; and, - in the latteryears, he began to bring even thp English-speaking s whites under his wing. His parents emigrated to South Africa when he was one year old, I and be was educated there and at the Miltoin Boys' High School I in Bulawayo, Rhodesia. He took 4 a Master's degree in psychology I and philosophy at Stellenbosch University (one of the major homes of Afrikaner thought) I and, in 1926 he went to study at - Hamburg, Leipzig. and Berlin universities. He returned in 1928, to become Professor of Applied Psychology at Stellenbosch. Public figure inm1936 Dr. Verwberd's first appear. 4 ance as a public figure of renown i in South Africa was in 1936, 4 when he led' agroup of Stellen- o bosch professors in a protest i against the entry into South < Africa of Jewish refugees from I Germany. The. following year i he became founder-editor of the i Afrikaner daily, Die Transvaler, 4 a post he held for 11 years. During the war this newspaper was the voice of those Afrikaners whose sympathies lay with Germany; afterwards, in 1947, his newspaper refused to mention the presence in South Africa of the Writish Royal Family, then 1 on tour. At this stage of his career Dr. Verwoerd was something of ' a \"bogyman\" in the eyes of ' those- English-speaking South Africans who were aware of him; even in Afrikaner circles he was at best an outside con.- tender for the leadership of Dr. Malan's Nationalist Party. This makes his subsequent political ascendancy over the whites of 1 South/ Africa all the more remarkable. In 1948 Dr. Malan defeated General Smuts' United Party - (which is supported by English i business and liberal Afrikaners) 1 but Dr. Verwoerd, who worked hard during the election, was defeated in the Alberton con- stituency. He entered the Senate and In 1950 was made Minister for Native Affairs. Almost from the day he was given the job Dr. Verwoerd began to build up the legal and theoretical framework of the apartheid state. Dr. Verwoerd did not invent the policy: it has roots going back to the days when the early Cape settlers drew a line and said to the Africans: \"Cross it at your peril.\" As Minister, Dr. Verwoerd drew the line right through the fabric of modern South African society-and he drew it In such intricate detail that, in a short time, no way across was left. He created a separate \" Bantu education under which the Africans are educated at separate schools, according to a syllabus designed, by reference to the Government's concept of their place in society. Non'whites were barred from. the white universities. A series of laws regulate the everyday lives of Africans in the towns -and on the farms, while at the same time mass- production box housing for Africans has replaced the old shantytowns and slums. There is no freehold in* them; the residents are divided according to tribe and no single black South African has security of job or tenure or hope of living out his life without going to jail at least once. A batch of laws restricts the activities of White Liberals, sym- pathisers (some of them Com- ' munists) and others giving out- and-out support to the Africans. Many have been banished, or ' gaoled, or restricted, and the 1 rigid control, and the fear, that A has gripped the Africans has 1 spread to bAe White Liberals. But, perhaps Dr. Verwoerd's most well-known policy has been the setting up of \" Bantustans,\" of which the Transkei is the first and most famous., This policy, designed to reserve 13 per cent. of the Republic as black-ruled, would house four million Afri- cans in eight \"self-governing Bantu national units\" which would, according to Dr. Ver- woerd, recognise the Africans' desire for national indepen- dence. The Showpiece of Transkei A great deal of money has been earmarked for developing the Transkei as a showpiece of this policy which is regarded by some White South Africans as dangerous; they argue that the eight Bantustans will be eight Trojan horses inside the country. Dr. Verwoerd was also long opposed by some Afri- kaners who saw -his policy as \"too soft on the blacks.\" Many White South Africans have long believed that for this reason Dr. Verwoerd was the only man who could put across [ the \" positive side of apartheid \" r -the side that involved spend- i ing White taxpayers' money on ) tribal states, some of which I would incorporate land bought i from Whites. In the South African context this policy made i Dr. Verwoerd a \"liberal under r the skin \" and the question now is whether his successor will I pursue Dr. Verwoerd's line or I turn to an even harder one. I Dr. Verwoerd's importance ; for South Africa's international i policy has been as great as his a effect on its domestic affairs. I While Minister of Native Affairs a he was preoccupied with the en- a forcement of segregation in r trains, buses, trams, post offices, . railway stations, and every public t place as well as the prospect for i building up industry in his Ban- s tustans in order to attract Afri- I 'cans away from the towns. f But in 1958 Dr. Verwoerd be- came Prime Minister, following j an election inside the party. 3uurn Arncn oa s~cuity f jo ortenue o Vicp A bach o law resric e st actiitie of hit Librals s t gaole, orrrshclcd andth h rigi cotro, ad te farth i has riped te Aricas h anb spred t th Whte ibeals Jo But, erhas Dr Veroerd t el most ell-nownpoliy ha tue the ettig upof Bantstanfat of wich he iansei i th firt 1 andmstfaous.Thisolic, 0 desinedto rsere 13percent sg of te Reubli as lackrule, 1 wotldhosefor ilio AriH8 cansin eght sel-govrnin a( Bantunatinal nits whih rh This was unprecedented; all pre- vious leaders had been unop- posed. As Prime Minister his African policies were.continued, but Dr. Verwoerd turned to establishing . his national and international reputation. Paradoxically, this achieved one of its most -tremendous boosts when, on April 9, 1960, a middle aged white man fired two shots at him within a few minutes of the official opening of an international trade fair in Johannesburg. The Prime Minis. ter survived; his assailant even- tually went to a mental hospital; EJ IWHITE RULED *_ BLACK RULED (IricrljgiMtissalist) * BLACK RULED (Bulffr States) and his position among his fol- lowers became rock-firm. But 1960 was also the year In which Mr. Harold Macmillan visited South Africa and, in his \"wind of change\" speech, an- nounced Britaif a policy of with- drawal from its African colonies. He thus foreshadowed the advance of African nationalism right down the continent-to the bership was so vociferous that Dr. Verwoerd led an orderly retreat and withdrew. It was thought then that he had made a grave mistake and suffered a severe defeat. But since its withdrawal from the Commonwealth as an indepen- dent republic South Africa has grown from strength to strength. Its army, police, and air force stage at which it is now in a tussle with Britain and South Africa over the future of Rhodesia. In the same year Dr. Verwoerd set in motion, and -won, a re- ferendum establishing South Africa as a republic-thus fulfil- ling a dream held by the Boers ever since Britain agreed to the country's independence in 1910. But the establishment of the republic gave an opening for attack: at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference the following year opposition to South Africa's continued mem- have . been bultup into the strongest military rtganisatioi in sub-Satharan Afria; its gold- based ecopoinmyhas easily been able to shrug' off the inter- Snational boycotts organised against its product, and Dr. Verwoerd's policy of granite- , fitmness, consbnld8 with extra- ordinary political luck, led to such victories as the World Court's decision in the republic's favour in the South West Africa b case earlier this year. e The Rhodesian crisis has 0 taught White South Africans the . dangers of living in a -world most of whose Governments dis- approve of apartheid and, as a result, Dr. Verwoerd had been pushing the endless search for self-sufficiency ever more relent lessly forward. South Africans have been stockpiling oil, building up their oil-from-coal plants, searching for oil in their own territory, and buying their own tanker fleets. Large Import Substitution They have bought their own aircraft and munitions factories, pushed forward import substitu- tion on every conceivable item of vital equipment, and diversi- fied their world markets as far as possible. All these policies, initiated during Dr. Verwoerd's regime, have been designed to make it possible for South Africa to withstand any con- ceivable onslaught. legacy is see it the adoinpany- ing map. His conception of Bantustaps was latterly enlarged to 'a\" '\"Comtmonwealth` 'of Southern African states\" in which the three British protec- torates of Basutoland, sBecuana. land and Swaziland would take a nSwagiland Dr. Verwoerd's Government has won the sup- port of the traditional ruler and his party; In Bechuanaland (due at for iddependence at the end of ly this month) the Presidentto-be, Mr. Seretse -Kbama, has le declared that however much be I dislikes apartheid be bas no it option but to co-operate with w South Africa; as for Basutoland - (due for lndependenoc on s October 4) its Prime Minister. * Chief Leabua Jonathan, made e history by beIS' o'e first African Premier to have an official meeting with the South African Prime Minister-last Friday. At the same time Dr. Banda of. Malawi has recognised that his country is powerless in its present geographic position- sandwiched between Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique; the Malawi policy has thus been one of co-operation with the Portuguese and extreme care in dealing with the Rhodesians and the South Africans. Only Dr. Kaunda, of Zambia, has the economic strength (based on his copper, mined by com- panies that also mine South i\" Africa's gold) that enables him to keep his African nationalism \" pure.\" He is orienting his economy north and east, away from the pull of Dr. Verwoerd's white southern powerhouse. Who will be His Successor? Thus Dr. Verwoerd dies at a time when no imaginable force I could threaten his people's ascendancy over the Africans for a good few years to come. Will L- his successor keep it up? The D most-tipped successor is Mr. d Johannes Balthazar Vorster. As s Minister of Justice Mr. Vorster a has acquired a reputation for being extremely right-wing, ^ tough, and ruthless in actions le designed to suppress any spark it of opposition. During the Second - World War he was interned a under Smuts' emergency laws on * the grounds that he was a Ger- r man sympathiser. Like Dr. t- Verwoerd, he is a Stellenbosch Is graduate; he was born in 1915 : and is pragmatically dedicated to Swhite supremacy. If he becomes ir Prime Minister it will mean a ir considerable swing to the right in South Africa, a possible alienation of the English support Dr. Verwoerd has built up, and a , likely ditching of the \" positive\" aspects of apartheid. Another possible. successor is Mr. Ben Schoeman, the present Ll- Leader of the House. He is an old favourite of poor-white ,. Afrikaner workers, a far milder man than Mr. Vorster, and pos- ,\" sibly a less astute politician. He I is 61. A comparative \" liberal\" in Afrikaner circles is an out- h sider for the succession-the Minister of Finance, Dr. T. E. Danges. He was to retire at S.th ,and ps ,tb yr-, an# the i Letters appear on Page 16 f possibility tnow is that he in might become a stop-gap Prime c- Minister while the battle for a *a more permanent successor is a; carried out within the party. Dr. Ddnges was the architect of s some of the most well-known p- apartheid legislation--such as Id the Population Registration Act is -but has a reputation for being if more moderate than Mr. e, Vorster. is The trouble for any successor i is that there is no South African [o leader in sight who has the pres- h tiSe in his own country that Dr. i Verwoerd enjoyed.

Cahnlm Reaction Indeed, print union leaders are reacting calmly to the rejection of the special fund. Although they were expected to meet informally later to*night to discuss the situa- tion, it seemed unlikely that any firm decisions would be taken until the unions met formally in London iu about two weeks' time. They are then likely to approach the NPA once moreand argue that, because their joint spptoach has failed, the costof4iving bonus should now be paid despite the freeze. The 25,000 .print workers in London and Manchester newspaper offices were due to receive a 2s-a- week bonus from September 1. Payment was delayed while the two sides approached Mr. Ray Gunter, Minister of Labour, to ask whether donations of an equivalent weekly sum into a \"special fund\" -possibly to be used for charitable purposes-was acceptable."

This is the first case of a major household appliance company outside the TV field to declare redundancies since the Prime Minister's economic statement on July 20. About 170 workers at Luton will lose their jobs next month, bring- ing the total number of known dis- missals blamed on the tightened dredit squeeze to just under 3,000, spread through such industries as fibres, furniture. TV assembly, and engineering. An Electrolux official explained: \"We very much regret having to declare redundancie. but the Government restrictions have hit sales of domestic appliances. \" We considered introducing short-time working, but rejected the idea because it might have to con- tinue for a long period.\" ' * Talks are being held with nnion representatives to reach agreement as to which employees should be paid off. But the company makes it clear that both its refrigerator and suction cleaner sections will be affected. Squeeze effects The squeeze is having a more marked effect on sales of the bigger appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, than on smaller household equipment, and market conditions were already difficult prior to the July package of economic measures. However. a spokesman for Hoover stated: \"We are not intending to declare any redundancies at this time.\" At the Peterborough head- qiarters of the Hotpoint division of British Domestic Appliances, another spokesman declared: \" We have no plans at present for reduc- ing our working strength.\"",

The move indicates that the authorities are now broadly satis fled with the level of the Treasury bill rate, which on Friday rose to a record figure of just over 6g per cent, The scheme for Bank of Sngland lending to housesr for one day, rather than the traditional mini. mum of seven, was Introduced in late June, with the apparent object, at the time, of fmproving the me m for carring the market ver rom a shortp e of credit one day to a surpu the next.

   "article_dc_title" : "The \"Voluntary\" Grocers Take the Offensive",
   "text_content" : "pianeuew Thu Repotter IN THREB MONTHS there have been three important managerial appointments within the leading \"symbol\" groups- the votuntary chains, of, in-W dependent grocers and whole- salers who have linked together, the better to exploit their pur- chasing and promotional power. All three individuals have a background of aggressriWe sell- ing. Mr. Rodney Lund. the new managing director of Mace Marketing Services, was Buro- pean manager of Carreras be- fore joining Urwick Orr and Partners as a management con- sultant specialising in marketing and selling. Last week., Mr. Ted Gillespie. former general sales manager with MacDonald and Sons (Biscuits), took up his appointment as chief executive with the Spar organisation. Back in July. Spar's sister group. VIVO. brought in Mr. Arthur Trotman from Beechams, in a similar role. It s a straw in the wind, and the clear implication is that these important groups in the industry are changing tack. There are other reasons for thinking that this may be the case. The voluntary groups now have over 20 per cent. of the country's total grocery trade- a share worth, in round terms. Â£600m. a year. And although they have been increasing their turnover as rapidly as'the mul- tiples, it has been recognised for some time that the supply of independent retailers pre- pared to sign on with them must eventualli run out. Buying in Bulk Going back five or six years, the role of the voluntary chains was to help the small grocers survive the price-cutting activi- ties of the supermarkets. To do this, they had to be able to match the supermarkets' special offers, and this meant buying in bulk on a co-operative basis. Very often. too, the small grocers were encouraged to go over to self-service in order to reduce their overheads. \" At that time, we were 'against! some- thing,\" states the marketing director of Mace, Mr. Roger Wililams. \"Now we have the more positive approach of being 'for' something. We believe that the independent store can compete, and can provide a more personal service.\" Even so. the supermarkets have not been dragging their feet. And just as emulation was the key to survival for the small grocers when this particular war\" first broke out, so now almost every trend that can be distinguished among the super- market companies' activities is mirrored in the policies of the ' voluntary group. There has been a considerable merging of interests among -wholsalers within the groups, bringing the economies one expects in larger units: they are actively develop- ing their own brands (Spar, which has probably 'gone fur- thest in this direction, has between 60 and 70 lines under its own name, and brought out its first jams this week): they are trylg to carry, a hir range of goods-particulary Meat, provisions, and confectIonery, which if properly handled can do much to enhance the reputa. tion of a store. Most important of all, they are actively encouraging their members to move into bigger premises. Mace. VG Services, Spar. and presumably others as well are prepared to give financial backing in the form of guarantees and short-term loans to members who want to move to larger tipres. A director of \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Spar explained that it might well cost Â£40,000 to fit and stock-up a new store: the group would advance possibly three- quarters of that amount to a member on the understanding that it would be paid back as quickly as possible. This policy of moving up- wards in terms of the size of premises has led to a situation where VG Services has 17 supermarkets (by the official definition a food store of over 2.000 square, feet) Mace has seven, and Spar 25. with plans for several more. In most cases these are operated by indepen- dent grocers, who draw the bulk of their supplies from their group wholesalers in the usual way; the exceptions are cases where a group-wholesaler has located a good site and has in- stalled a manager until some- one with the right 4ualffications is available to take over. This treud apart, much effort as is being directed towards itn f creasing the takings of the annul rs stores One of the big groupi, le after carrying out a full fae*, cr ment of the potential growth l p- new businesses signing on (for , a nominal fee of Â£15-f30). will r- send in a \" commando \" of four as or five experts to supervise er merchandising and store plan* ut ning. Another has begun to e appoint regional executives, 9e attached to head office ratlib t, than to the local wholesalv; y, with similar responsibilities tot t guiding local members. All the a- groups offer extensive training courses and seminars. y The implication of this, borne ir out by the figures, is that the er growth of the voluntary group s, movement is now occurring 'rs through the expansion of turn- ve over rather than through the as signing-up of new members. as Most report that their retail e membership is fairly static-in as the case of VG. at around the 3.000 mark. for Mace at about 5,000, Spar 3,500 and VIVO 1.500. The number of whole- salers within the organisations has actually fallen, through amalgamations, but the turnover of these four particular groups is now up to Â£295m. According to VG, the average weekly takings of its stores has now reached Â£483. a rise of 26.4 per cent. within two years. If there is a problem, it is that the voluntary chains are so similar in concept that they lack an individual \" image.\" Spar and VIVO in particular must tackle this-since they came to- gether a year ago they have shared the same buying and training facilities-and the ap- pointment of new chief execu- tives may be designed to find an answer. But this is a minor dificulty to place beside a .major achievement-the small grocers have bounced back and are once again on the attack.",

But bow far this showing reflects a true improvement in margins, and how far other factors is questionable. For instance, moneys raised from selling off the unprofitable, Â£1.08m. investment in Angtian Building Products-it only produced a 4,a000 dividend-and last November's Â£500,000 con- vertible loan issue have been used to fund the Â£1A2m. overdraft. thus saving interest charges-servicing the convertible did not begin until July 31-which last year totalled Â£105,000, And with a business like Boulton and Paul-constructional engineering, building components and equipment-'-the question of fortuitous completions must arise. But the fact remains that profits are usefully higher, and another \"substantial\" increase in the second half is expected. In real terms this could mean Â£350.000, making Â£650.000 pre-tax for the year. against Â£505.000. and provid- ing cover of 2.3 times for the 1Z% per cent. dividend. As this has already been paid as an interim for tax reasons long before the freeze, it will be interesting to see whether the group feels justified in considering a final despite the clamp down. It has the scope. In the meantime, the \"A\" shares, sell- ing (possibly) at 6.7 times earnings and yielding 6.6 per cent.., look solidly based. Warner's Camps Once again,' the expense sheet of Warner's Holiday Camps fol- lows the trend of gross revenue- both show rises around the 17 per cent. mark-and profits for 1965- 1966 emerge only Â£9,000 higher at Â£330.000 before tax. Prices and capacity were higher last year, but so was rainfall: it remains to be seen whether this year. with a aitier mixed suimmer. has justified Warner's expansion. The 2s Ordi- nary are not looking for much with a yield of 6.3 per. cent. at 4s. 10/d and a P/E ratio. at 9.7 times, well helow either Butlins or Ponting. But if the foreigni travel restric- tions do their job, Warner's spare capacity could give'it the boost it needs. Brown Bros. With first-half sales showing \" satisfactory increases \" in all divi- sions. Brown Brothers has managed to produce higher profits despite a general narrowing of margins. But in the second half the improve. ment could be whittled away by greater economic pressure and the effects of SET. Since margins had fallen from 3.4 to 3 per cent. in 1965 this does not leave much room for manoeuvre. Even so, Brown 'hope at least to hold last 0 year's proetaxz fgs of Â£843,000 which would poduc4 earnings of 8.3 r cent. d leave the main tained-as tothcaat- I er ean= ' dividend coveted a slim 1.2 times. d In fact Brown's performance so far is a creditable one.

BIDS AND DEALS FLEMINGS HOTEL BIDDING FOR NORBRECK Flemings Hotel is offering, through Investment Analysis, to acquire the Ordinary capital of Norbreek Hydro at 42s per Â£1 share. The Norbreck directors, who with their families own 19,878 Ordinary shares-some 39.75 per cent, of the total equity-intend to accept in re- spect of their holdings and recom- mend acceptance by other holders. If the offer is accepted in respect of more than 90 per cent. it is Flemings' intention (on the offer be. coining unconditional) to place such number of Ordinary shares as will result in the public having a 35 per cent interest in the voting power of Norbreck. The directors of Norbreck estimate that net taxed profts of that company for the year ending October 31, 1966, will be approximately Â£15,300 and in that event would have recommended a dividend of 6 per cent. Mr. H. T. Brown, chairman and managing director of Norbreck, will resign on the offer becoming uncondi. tional and it is proposed that he be paid Â£1,500 by Norbreck as compean. sation.

'Chairman Sir Maurice Fiennes covers his forecast with the \"usual hedges\" and also \"strikes a note of warning\" about dividends. * Freezes apart he say, \"we shall this year receive the full blast of Corporation Tax; during four years of recession we have had to draw on reserves; we may have need of an extensive. capital expenditure programme; and finally, it would not be safe to make any longer range predictions.\" Conservative Dividend Policy He therefore anticipates that the Board's recommendation will be \" conservative.\" For 196546 .and the three preceding years the payment was 11 per cent. each year. At end-March, current liabilities of 1118m. (Â£7.6m.) included overdrafts of Â£225m. (hil). Current assets stood at. Â£16.7m. -(13.18m.) and included cash and short loans f1.23m. (Â£0.79m., debtors, etc, Â£8-23m. (Â£7.43.) and work in progress, after deducting Â£5427m. 44.79.) pay- ments on account, Â£0.75m. (Â£3.6m.). Commitments were estimated at Â£535,000 (Â£834.000). Sir Maurice stresses that the group's -overall results are largely conditioned by the performance of Te Power s Corporation, Davy anrid United Engineerng and Ash' more Benson Pease. The directors believe the improve- ment in the affairs of Power'Gas will be malntaifed. 'Much of I present plants for the Gas Boards in Great North Sea Gas The future in this regard will be \"powerfully affected\" by the recent North Sea natural gas discoveries which In time, though not imme. diately, will \"clearly reduce the demand for gas manufacturing plants using petroleum feedstocks.\" Members are assured, however, that the Power-Gas directors have been well aware of that \" for a long time and are not unprepared.\" As recently announced, Power-Gas now has an association with L'Alr Liquidp of Prance whereby Power-Gas will be in a position to supply liquefaction plnts for natural gas storage and for other cryogenic purposes. Apart from this, Power-Gas is rapidly expanding in other fields of chemical and non-ferrous metallurgical industry and the faith of the directors in its futare is \"unimpaired.\" The chairman explains that the future of the two iron and steel plant companies.is more difficult to assess. It has been the, lic to keep those companies in technical readiness even if this meant takina contracts at \"wretched \" prices. \"The question is when the' market 'for their products will revive to a. point which justifies the policy.' He adds that it seems there must, in due course, be a substantial recon. struction of the British steel indusy to embracthe new technology. quite irrespective of ownership. The British steel industry, must for a long time. be' the largest single group of customers as the group's fortunes are bound up with the 'industry's deve- lopment and replacement programmes. \"'Unfortunately the industry is once again bedevilled by politics. This is not the place to argue the case for or against nationalisation, except to suggest that such a drastic change in the very foundations of the industry must inevitably imnpose a delay which the' country cannot afford.\" declares Sir Maurice. \"Political Football\" \" It' i our misfortune that we have to wait on the sidelines while the poiltiall football is kicked around. I canot forecast when the tide 'hlttuM *Â»wholwl'wfll --vtive't- the fortunes of our iron and steel plant companies, but there is good techno- logical eason for supposing that turn it will.\" The 1965-66 group results says the chairman, seen \"against the back- ground of some Â£33m. of sales and about Â£14m. of capital employed, underlines the \" hard realities' nder current conditions of earning a livng by the engineering and manufacturing of heavy capital equipmdnt. Men* bers were warned last year that there was no possibility of any Immediate improvement and, in fact, the result is very close In sum to the directors' prediction. About 50 per dent. of the current order book of the entire group is for export-\" Â£74m. out of ElOm., or thereabouts.\" Meeting, 4. Orosvenor Gardens, S.. September 28, at noon. .1sw.

Alho, what 'wi be the basic price on, which any future capital gains or losses would be assessed, that is, the original valuation as on April 6, 1965. or the price at which the shares were repurchased ? In a case such as yours, the first rule is that you have to apply the rules of the short term gains tax first, disregarding for the time being the capital gains tax. Under the short term gains tax, if the sale at 18s is followed by a purchase of the same number of shares at 17s, in the same Stock Exchange account,. 'that purchase and sale will be matched. and the profit will be liable to short term gains tax.

The following ae extracts from the Statement by the Chairman, Mr. 0. C. D'Arcy Biss, which has been circulated to shareholders with the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1966: Shareholders will recall that in my interim statement last February, I indicated that the rofits for the year to 31st arch, 1966 would be consider- ably lower than those for the previous year. The substantial reduction in trading profits is the outcome of the difficulties of which warning was piven in that statement; in particular it has not been possible to take into account the results of cer- tain nuclear contracts, including Trawsfynydd, which cannot be ascertained until negotiations currently in progress have. been completed.

Comparative figures for Subsidi 31st March, 1%5 have not been gia which took place during that year. The reduction in profit of some Â£120,000 in the United Kingdom arises mainly from the fact that our major United Kingdom subsidiary company, Fairey Engineering Ltd., has traded at a loss, due to two major factors. Firstly, it has not been possible fully to recover the overheads of the Stockport fao. tory due to under-utilisation of the facilities and, secondly, certain contracts taken on to fill the gap have proved or may prove unprofitable, and it has been necessary to make provisions for antic pated losses on certain of these contracts. As already mentioned, no account has been taken of the outcome of the Trawsfynydd contract on which the com- pany has been working for the last six years and which is now nearly completed. Negotlations to agree the considersIs arla- tions from the orinal ip cation are still being di ed with the client, and din the outcome of these ngottion, it has been considered prudent to continue our previous policy in this respect.

The company has a good volume of orders -on hand but one of its main problems still is to recruit sufficient skilled labour. It is to be hoped that current Government measures will provide help in this direction. Work is building up on the first of the second generation of British nuclear power stations at Dungeness, and this is gener. ally up to proramme. Proct work is also being undertaken in anticipation of possible orders for similar stations at home and oversea. Some orde have been ob. tained from the United King. dom Atok.c Energy Authority to undertake work associated with the prototype fast reactor. This system will almost certainly be employed in the third British nuclear power, programme. Thus the company Is a quiring ex- rience which will be prt of su stock-ln'trade for the future.

The turnover of ihdustrial file increased by 50% .over the previous year. Faklre Sabele 'Ltd. ( fnmy statement last year, I referred to the fornation of this com- pany and, as can be seen from the trading figures, it has had a very successful first year of operation, Sales are 50% higher than in the previous year and the results reflect the wider range of items man- factured. Apart from meeting the in- creased demand for stainless steel casks and kegsin sizes from 9 to 18 gallons, we have now extended our operation to include cellar tank units of capacities up to 180 gallons, and a number of the leading breweries have already been supplied with complete unstalla- ions. The company's sheet metal and power pressdivisions also continue to make very satisfactory profits. Fainey Matte M.d A policy of expansion of our \"and Marina\" as a means of in- creasing turnover is proving well justified Slipway facilities have reaently been extended and the growth of repair work is encouraging. Following a number of suc- cesses in off-shore power boat races our Huntsman continues to be our most marketable boat. It is well supported by the Fisherman and the successful introduction of the Mark 2 Firefly, We are also developing a new 18 ft. glass, fibre cabin boat in the lower price range based on a.Ray Hunt design. Nevertheless, expansion of our sales of boats will undoubtCdly be inhibited by the present national financia stringency and credit shortage. I addition, the company is still finding it ex- tremely difficult to recruit suit- able labour. Falry Surveys Ltd. his company has had another suc- cessful year and the plans for the building extension, foreseen in the 1965 Report, were put into effect during the year, for completion in October, 1966. Photographic and mapping work has been undertaken in a number of countries, including Jordan, Iran, Saudi-Arabia, Zambia, Ghana, Togoland, Nigeria, Libya, and the Carib. bean, all in support of develop- ment proects, whilst in Decem- ber 196 the company was honoured by being selected to' carry out surveys or the Court of Arbitration concerned with' the A ntineChile frontier dispute. During the year Fairey Surveys were also heavily in- volved in large scale surveys in the United Kingdom including, for the first time, photography under contract to the Ordnance Survey. Flight trials work for the Royal Aircraft Establish. meat, Farnborough, also con- tinued. The company's electro. hydraulic vibrator projet made good progress during the year and considerable advances In technical performance were achieved.

It will be realid that the \"un. foreson circumstances of an economic nature, alfflecting i. dustry generally' have become v iibPe and that the economlo situation of thil country has undoubtedly teriorated.

   "text_content" : "Sir,-Roeahtly the Monopoties Commission published its riport on the sale of Kodak Colour Film and presented ample facts and figures to suggest that Kodak's net profits were high and not in the public interest. The Commission recommends that \"significant rt- diuctions should be made in Kodak's own selling prices for calour film and processing . . In the light of the Commission's findings this is a reasonable recom- mendation and one expects the Board of Trade to take appropriate action. However, the Commission also recommends that \"Kodak should reduce the normal retailer's dis- count on the sale of its colour film to yield an amount not sub- stantially more than the amount received by the retailer on com- parable black-and-white film ...\" The Commission gives no facts or figures to substantiate this astound- ing recommendation. What the Commission calls the \"normal\" retailer'b discount is. in fact, a discount of only 30 per cent. which is3% per cent, below the accepted and time-honotired mark-up in shops. All overhead expenses, wages. taxes, rents, profits (if pos- sible) have to come out of these 30 per cent. and I have no bhesita- tion in stating that no photographic retailer who provides a specialised service could afford to sell'colour film should his discount be further reduced. (Taking the purchase tax situation into consideration, 30 per cent in fact becomes a mere 26% per cent.). The retailer pays 4s 2d for a black-and-white film which he sells at Ss 1Od; he has to find 8s for the equivalett colour film which he sells for 10s 8d. The Commission suggests that the retailer should hot be allowed a substantially higher mark-u# on the second transactiohn than on the first, although his capital expenditure is twice as higb This is just nonsense. The Commission gives nb'factual Aiures to show that the present .30 per cent mirk-up on colour film is unreasonably high. It does produce figures to show that colour film costs more than black-and- white film; apart from the fact that this is a truism which has no rele- vance to the retailer's margin, these figures are often completely incorrect: \". . . where a charge for processing is included in the colour film price, this combined \"rice may be about five times the black-and-white price.\" The correct figures are: 35s 7d to 37s Id for a colour film-16s 5d for the equivalent black-and-white film, processing included in both cases. Does the Commission know any- thing about specialised. service? How would the Commission ap- portion my mark-up when I spend an hour to sell a 24s box camera *to a schoolboy. and five minutes to sell an Â£80 camera? Does the Commission Understand that-in the nature of my business as an expert photographer and photo- graphic dealer'- I consider both transactions to be entirely satis- factory? No doubt bazaars and chain stores could sell colour film at a net loss, making good with high profits on other items; would this be in the public interest? I have no such goods on which high profits can be made. but I can and do save my customers pounds and pounds by advising them expertly on their purchases.

   "text_content" : "Sir-he sabort answer to Mr. Joe Rogaly's question (Is Emigra- tion the Answer to the Doctor's Dilemma ?) is yes. The young doc- tor's dilemma is that he sees his future geaed to the atmosphere of a trade union dispute over phy. What the young doctor, no less than his seniors, really wants is genuine professional atmosphere to apply all his hard-learned skiM and If knowledge in its fullest extent to the benefit of the sick. He is only too well aware that all the inter- minable arguments about \" free at the time\" medicine, prescription charges, abortive hospital plans and so on are of little importance. The profession can organise and supply everything, without any ex- ceptions, that the patient needs in abundance in the \"market\" pondi- tions that the politicians so actively disparage. The appalling present dilemma could be resolved overnight by the simple process of taking the prac- tice of medicine out of politics. Let the doctors look after the business, build the buildings and supply the r necessary skill. If the politicians are so anxious to take their cut from the patients' payment for these facilities, let them do so by simply insuring the entire popula- tion on the lines of BUPA. the Australian system, the Blue Cross Blue Shield system or whatever. Given professional freedom the escapers would be back in no time: mAybe the lazy doctor and the politician will lose their comfort- able niches but the patitnt, who is, after all, the be-all and end-all of the business and who is, in fact, in the most serious dilemma, will see a real return on the money he has taken from him and receive the kind of 1966 medicine to which he is entitled.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN THE PROGRAMME at Doncaster to-day, apart from the St. Leger, consists of a Selling Stakes for three-year-olds and four-year-olds rnr over six furlongs, and four handicaps, so that backers would do well to go cautiously. However, with Piggott in tremendous form there is a temp tation to support Barnie's Image in the Fitzwilliam Selling Stakes (2.0), for though this colt may not be altogether genuine these days. he ran sufficiently well at Beverliy the other day to suggest that, with the champion jockey in the saddle, he is capable of wining here. Crazy Paving, who also possesses considerable ability, but who has given the impression of 'not relishing a close faish, oulnd well prove dangerodus. Franconia, a superbly-bred filly b Charlottsville, out of a yperion mare, not be as good as her pedigree suggests, but, judged on her running in her two most recent races, she is improving, and with only 7 st 10 Ibs to carry she appears to be well treated in the Danum Handicap (2,40). Though there is a strong tip for Navan, who defeated the useful Londora at a difference of 6 Ib over course and distance here at the beginning of July, for the Town Moor Handicap (3.55) J prefer the chance of Prince's Error, a six-years-old gelding trained at Newmarket by H, Leader, whos weight is reduced from 7 it 10 lbs Charlottow for the to 7 st 5 lbs owing to C. Williams claiming the apprentice's allow- ance. The runners for the Prince of Wales's Nursery Handicap (4.25) are by no means an impressive collection and probably the safest selection is Beauseant, whom J. Jar- vis trains for Mr. J. A. C. Lilley, the owner of Pretendre. Beauseant, a tough colt by Pinza, has won over seven furlongs and has indicated more than once that he will have no difficulty in staying a nille. He has 9 at 5 Ibs to carry here, but even so he does not seem to be harshly treated in the matter of weight, and, judged on running at Yarmouth last month, he has the beating of Lyford Cay. Lite Rapide is preferred to Tandem for the Rufford Abbey Handicap (4.55), though Budging by the result of the New England Handicap at Newmarket on August 6, when they finished third and fourth respectively, separated by a neck, behind Greek Honey and Prince Jamie, there will be precious little between them. But over this distance I expect Tandem to come out the better. However, Tipperly, a four-year- old gelding trained by G. Bo d at Dunbar, might upset them both. Admittedly, he has little in the way of finishing speed, but he has shown on several occasions that he is a strong, resolute. galloper, and this course and distance will suit him. SSt. Leg-Page 22"

   "text_content" : ",Fine Far, part of the George Weston group, is planning a major development programme which will reinforce its position as Britain's largest supermarket chain. ...e.u.a ..u.5. aU.asIIIUas i %,UU This comes after a significant change in the company's trading fortunes, forecast in THE FINANCIAL TiMes last December. As reported last week, Fine Fare's pre-tax profits soared by Â£617,000 to a record Â£702,000 In the year ended March 31, 1966. The big improvement in results reflected a vigorous reorganisation at Fine Fare including top management changes and a resbhapin policy aimed at dosing or seUllin of unprofitable supermarkets and stores. Now, however. it is intended to add some 100 new supermarkets to the chain over the next four years. Already Fine Pare operates 304 supermarkets in addition to 329 ss. service and four department stores. Plan* outl nod in the company' latest annual review include the pur. chase of Copper and Co's Stores in Scotland from Associated British Foods also part of the Weston group Negotiations are at an adaned stage and If successful will ibing 86 establishments into the Fine Fare en uth-east ngland neaotlstion are under way for the acRulsiton over 30 self-service an c6unter- service shops operated by Hudson Bros., a subsidary through Food Securities of AB Foods. The present policy therefore seems to be one of channelling some of the AB Foods outlets into the Pine Fare organisation. This ybar a further 10 supermarkets will be added to hose in England and Wales and it is intended that the number of new openings will rise to around 30 a year. Prospects Further department store develop. ment I also planned a well as t qutsiilo of two smaer Igroupe illed ne d. Present mansieP policy, says the review, is to *xpnd on this side of the group as well as on the grocery side. Mr. James Gulli , who became managing director last November, predicts a further substantial increase in - profitability durin the coining year. 'We the i mprovement our profitability fully to offset the additional increases in operating costs which we shall have to bear.\" he states. Results for the first quarter of the current year show a \"significant\" Improvement over the same period of At March 31 last the group had a total employed capital of . 13.5m., including current assets of Â£10.9m. The increase l4 current assets (up Â£2.6m. from the end of the previous year) reflects the sale of unprofitable assets during the period. However, at the balance-sheet date there was over Â£3m. on loan to the holding company and associated companies.",

Her dancing mapni- ficently sums up the glonous virtues of the Kirov style: the classicism is pure? unaffected, and marked by a divine simplicity. It has eloquence, nobility, and the kind of lyrical faultlessness of line that marks the whole com- pany manner. But this is no cold perfection, no academism for its own sake; she makes Odette a tragic figure but. as always with this company, without any exteriorised dramatics: the way the choreography is stated, I the pulse and phrasing of the move- ment tell the whole tragedy in entirely satisfying fashion for any- one prepared to forget the habitual ballerina paraphernalia of tragic glances and appliqued romantics. Makarova uses her beautiful physique and technical prowess with the sensitivity and unemphatic grandeur typical of her school: she possesses a complete mastery of legato (the pas de deux with Sieg- fried is one long cantilena of lyrical dancing), a wonderful lightness, and a musicality of phrasing that takes us to the heart of the music. beA ra perfect Odette, lin sm.

The whole performance had a greater strength of atmosphere than on the first night, and the company's romantic view of the ballet seemed even more pleasing; but from among the profusion of fine dancing, mention must be. made of Gabriella Komleva in the pas de trois in Act 1, bringing a bounding grace and an aristocratic elegance to her solos that were heart-stirring.",

   "text_content" : "by DAV'ID CAIRNS The contrast between Monday's, performance of the C major Piano Concerto of Mozart and last night's performance of the D minor was marked and melancholy. It was the contrast between Stephen Bishop's crisp and search- ing account of one solo part and Walter Susskind's dull, unilluminat- ing account of the other; between the highly alert and sensitive par- ticipation of a small chamber orchestra (the ECO) and the mere accompaniment of a reduced symphony orchestra (the BBC); between Raymond Leppard'S con- ducting and-but therein lies one crucial difference. The D minor was directed by Mr. Susskind from the keyboard, with the old, inevit- able consequence of lack of con- centration and intensity in the solo part and lack of character and flexibility in the orchestral part. The first movement in particular was woefully pedestrian and rhythmically sluggish-and in music of such flie and dark beauty and disquiet! There were pleasant moments, and as pianism it was perfectly respectable, but on lhe whole, after Bishop's playing on the previous evening, not to men- tion Serkin's memorable perform- ance of the D minor at.the Guildhall in July, 1 found it a penance. In most cases Susskind continued to conduct the orchestra up to the very last moment. Sometimes one even speculated with a kind of sporting interest whether he would get his hands to the notes in time. Of course, his own performance suffered, while at the same time he was unable to mould a truly vital accompaniment. The whole thing assumed the character of a con- ductor's benefit. That is at least a change from the more customary practice, which is to have an eMI- nent concert pianist playing at musical director. But either way it is usually the work which suffers, and I am afraid I could not help regarding the serious lapse of memory which overtook him near the beginning of the finale (momen- tarily echoed a little later when he began to play the minor key version of the second subject In the major) as an act of nemesis. Mozart was much better served by some charming pieces for vocal trio and three basset horns, written to Italian texts for private gather- ings in the house of Mozart's Viennese friends the Jacquins (Gottfried von Jacquin-to whom the famous letter from Prague about the tremendous popularity of -Figaro was written-was even thought-at one time to have com- posed them himself). They are delightfully easy, bland, melli- fluous pieces. Especially in the group numbered by Kochel 436-8 the parts slide in and out with the felicity and inevitability of per- fectly-made machinery. The flavour is that of the slow movement of the Quintet K.452, with anticipations of Cost. They were very nicely done by Sheila Armstrong, Maureen Lehane and John Carol Case. accompanied by Anthony Jennings, Keith Puddy and Richard Temple Savage. The second half was dedicated to Mahler'k Tenth Symphony, which was being performed for the second year running at the Proms. For the true Mahlerian the sudden fact of the work's existence (made possible by the devotion and skill of Deryck Cooke) must still seem like a miracle, and added to it must be the satisfaction of knowing that the anguished farewell which is thee Son of the Earth and the shattered, valedictory mood of the Ninth are not the last word after all, but that Mahler's testament closed with the genuine peace which the Tenth achieves at the end, For music lovers as a whole there Is another Mahlerlan \"adventure\" to experience, in all its extraordinary diversity, as fas- cinating in the new\" movements as in the already accessible ones. The performance was tentative at first (suggesting that another re- hearsal or two would have made all the difference) and rhythmically stlff, especially In the frst Scherzo, but it acquired bloom and flow and authority as it went along,' the sad waltz music in the second Scherzo was beginning to sound like the real thing, and the strings by the end were playing with a full, rich and eloquent tone."

The culprits in tes. aeen ae always bard to identify), dcilded that it was not a pprtoot ilm to he shown; and somehow Wtie. authorities arrived at a compromise whereby the film was banned 'to the public, but permitted for screen. ing to the Press and the jury. All that this achieves is to attract a disagreeable notoriety to a film which, if outspoken, is certhinly innocent of any obscene intention. Asked for her view of the situation, Miss Zetterling said, picturesquely. that her feeling was less of anger than of witnessing a nasty 'road accident and wishing she could help the poor devils on the other slde of the road. Before Miss Zetterling I can think of no successful actor--and certainly oo suqcessful actress- who has turned into a coherent film director. But Night Games, follow- ing on her earlier Loving Couples, confirms that her talents, if bizarre, are sufbsantial, that she has a vigorous and individual style, and visions that are her own. Coherent is not necessarily the same as comprehensible; and-at her Press conference Miss Zetterling (still as charming and unassuming in her new role) invited her audi- ence to make what they would of her allegory. It is the story of a complex legacy: along with a chateau, the young hero inherits memories of a distressingly preco- cious boyhood. His beautiful mother's despairs and frustrations led her into sexual and social ex- travagances-choosing to give birth to a baby (still-born, not unnatur- ally) in the midst of an uproarious party; surrounding herself with an entourage of ladies and gentlemen I of eccentric sexual activities; re- I turning her 12-year-old son's inces- tuous interest in her. The other influence in the boy's life has been I a nice, dotty old aunt (the veteran actress Naima Wifstrand), who i finally runs mad on finding the I 12-year-old heir bedded between a 1 blowsy girl and a fat old gentle- 1 man, both with their eyes on a share of the legacy and something more besides. Grown up, and in love with a young woman who (naturally) re- sembles his mother, the young man finds that he can only achieve 4 adult normality by some sort of violent exorcism. This he achieves by blowing up the- castle and all it I contains. This unsettling story-which Mai Zetterling and her writer- husband David Hughes are con- currently publishing in novel form -evokes scenes and images which are authentically and appropriately disturbing (but not, as the censors would have them, prurient or cor- rupting). To my mind the most difficult scenes-the mother. and' the 12-year-old in mutual seduc- MothwmmdÃ½ Som In \"Night Gannes\" ion; a seance of slapstick erotic flms, while the hero, in the next room, is trying without success to consummate his marriage-are handled with a frankness which .in itself amounts to tact. Certainly the finale-the erstwhile guests looting everything, movable before the explosion; and after it, the hero's sudden sense of liberation- is handled with.considerable feeling for mood. Night Games is not. the only film to come to the attention of Venetian moralists. The distributors of Roger Corman's The Wild Angels, the film selected to open the festival, proposed to give a repeat showing for journalists wfho had missed it. At the time sei for the start of the show, the police arrived, prevented those of us who were in the cinema from going out, and those who were outside from going in, and managed to hold up the projection 'for half an hour., Then, quite suddenly, without explanation or apology they sud- denly vanished, and the show went on. No doubt the would-be censer had hearsay kinowledge of what the film is about; and a superficial description of the action certainly .makes. The Wild Angels sound quite dubious. A band of motor- cycle hoodlums burn around, up to any kind of vicious mischief. One of themn is seriously injured while resisting arrest The others kidnap him from the hospital where the police have kept him, and hbe dies. They arrange a funeral for him, but get bored with it, put the par- son in the coffin and make the corpse the central figure in an orgiastic party .in the church. * But it is a mistake to approach .Corman films (whether the low- budget corhmercial horror-comics after Poe or'The Secret Invasion, a more ambitious, highly idiosyn- cratic war film) at their face value. If you .look to The Wild Angels for realism, or for social. com- mentary you find, as many critics here have done, only a shabby imitation of The Wild One. Corman is not a realist; rather (though he might well deny it) a surrealist. His attraction to Gothick horror, his fascination with nightmare and necrophllia finds direct parallels in 'the interests P1 '6o ataln'tioM f*t 0OB, w t bins odfy p f i' rogh and ready cpamfiirial values can too easiy cocpal their creative cohesion, the preisence i behind them of a serious and cultivated artist. It is a year for nightmares. Conrad. Rooks is a young man who (at his oWn conslderable expense)I has' recofated on film the experiences of a drug addict undergoing disintoxication. He plays the central role, and his film. Chlappuaqa, opens with a title whith begins \"This is a telegram from Hll ... .\". and progresses' in the same indulgent vein. There is almost an insolence in his' assumption that this patticular kind of self-confession' is interesting enough to be recounted at length: and one resents the waste of artists like Robert Frank (ihoto- grapher), Ravi Shankar (music) *and Jean-Louis Barriult, who-plays the hero's doctor. If only the Italian authorities banned films for being boring! I An altogether more interesting film is the Czech Bwald Schorm's Courage for Every Day. Here the nightmare is of feeling convictions weaken, compromise take over. Is it the inevitable loss of youth, disillusion within oneself; or is it the hero's disillusion with the revolufion? The situation and the characters are totally unexpected in a film from a Communist cinema. Perhaps the daring needed to go so far in doubts of the estab- lishment may explain the frequent obscurities of the hero's motives. Nightmare of another kind in- vests Gillo Pontecorvo's La Bataglia dl Algeria, a powerful and frankly partisan account of the Algerian tragedy and triumph. Making no use of newsreel or I actuality material at all, this is Y astonishingly effective dramatic reconstruction of contemporary history. It is interesting how much more successful Pontecorvo-a; e documentarist with a strong e dramatic sense-is when using P predominantly' non-professional e players against the background of * a real city and a real community, * than he was in his earlier film Kapo, where he used stars to relatC e a fictional story about a Nazi con- Q centration camp. The meticulous relation of the techniques and the h horrors of terrorist warfare, the r- singular belief the film imposes s (its method often resembles Rosi's i,. Salvatore Giuliano) makes La i- Bataglia di Algeria remarkably arresting viewing. ' With Truffaut's . British-made - Fahrenheit 451, de Seta's Un s Uomo a Meta and Bresson's y wonderful Au Hasard, Balthasar '. still to come Venice is making ;r good form. And to offset any dis- t) appointments there is a glittering o retrospective of films from n \" America's Roaring Twenties.\" a about which I hope to write at a length next week.",

But whny should not the BBC revert to an earlier practice and give us at! least five-minute intervals between programmes, and, say, one half. or threequarter-hoUr Interval in the middle of the evening? However undiscrlmlnating the average audience Is-and perhaps they are less so than we glys them credit for-don't they, too, feel the need to pause after a programme, to have a few words' together about it, to, discuss It for just a few moments? Perhaps on the other channel, the ads, do give just this opportuniy. The BBC gives none. That would be a start; but only a start.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN It rarely pays to be dogmatic 1 where racehorses are concerned, I and this being the case I could I well be wrong in predicting that i this afternoon's St. Lger will be I won by one of three horses- i Charlostown, Pretendre or Sodium. I For example, there has been con- < siderable support-not necessarily I inspired by nostalgic memories of the great Arsenal football team of 1 pre-war days-for David Jack, a I colt by Pampered King; out of a mare by Owenstown, trained by B. Lambton at Newmarket. This support was accorded before it was announced that Lester Piggott had agreed to ride David Jack, but frankly I cannot visualise this colt winning, for his best public form represented by a comfortable three lengths' victory over Haymaking in the Magnet Cup at York is some way below classic standard, as may be deduced from the fact that the third horse, Master Barry, who was conceding David Jack 6 lbs, has twice failed since in handicap company. Black Prince II is a good, staying colt and, bearing in mind that he had not raced in public since the Derby, he did well to run Hermes to a short head for the Great Voltigeur Stakes at the York Ebor meeting. Since he finished many lengths in front of Hermes in the Derby, it is not surprising that he is preferred to J. Oxley's charge in the St. Leger betting. However, it is posssible that Hermes, a bay colt by Aureole, out of Ark Royal, who finished second, to Meld in the Oaks of 1955. will confirm the York running. He will be suited by soft ground, and is my idea of the best outsider, though there is no reason to suppose that either he or Black Prince II is oapable of reverting Epsom form. with Charlottown or Pretendre. When assessing the prodpects of runners for the St. Leger it almost invariably pays to rely on form shown in the Derby, and strict observance of this rule has paid some surprisingly good dividends. For example, in 1953, Never Say Die, a convincing winner of the Epsom classic, was allowed to start at odds of 100 to 30 at Doncaster, in spite of the fact that his jockey, the irrepressible C. Smirke, told all and sundry that the late Mr. Robert Sterling Clark's colt was sure to win. And in 1957, Bally- moss, runner-up to Crepello at Epsom, profited by the latter's absence from the St. Leger field to win'at 8 to 1. If one accepts this year's Derby form as being reliable, the St. Leger looks to be a two-horse race between CharlotitoJn and Pre- tendre. At Epsom Charlollown defeated Pretendre by a neck, the pair finishing five lengths clear of Other Selectio Black Prince 1, with Sodiunm It lengths farther behind, fourth, and most people who saw Ã½the race would probably subscribe to the \" view that Charlottown had a trifle more in hand than was implied by the official verdict. Both are certain, judging by their pedigrees, to stay the distance of the St. Leger, and Charlottown has, in fact, won over one mile, five fur- longs and 60 yards. One of the problems of to-day's race is how to assess the relative merits of Charlottown and Sodium. At Epsom, Charlottown finished approximately 6% lengths in front of Sodium. But before the race G. Todd, the trainer of Sodium. informed Mr. R. J. Sigtia, the ' owner, that there was something radically wrong with the colt and that he had abandoned all hopes of his winning. In the circum- stances Sodium must be accounted to have run extremely well, and Todd's estimation that he would have won the Derby was vindi- cated when he turned the tables on Charlottown in the Irish Sweeps Derby. A fortnight later Sodium ran a splendid race when runner-up by half a length to Aunt Edith in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Indeed, no criticism of that admirable jockey, P. Durr, is implied, when one says that had it not been for an inspired piece of riding by Piggott, the verdict could conceivably have gone the other way. In view of these hap- penings it was not, perhaps, sur- prising that Sodium should have een t odds-on to beat Chariot-* town for the Oxfordshire Stakes at Newbury on August 13. But in that race he came under pressure and was beaten fully, three fur- longs from home, finally trailing in 13 lengths behind Lady Zia Wernher's colt, and eight lengths behind Desert Call II, a French- bred five-years-old bought by Mr. J. J. Astor as lead-horse for last year's St. Leger winner, Prbvoke. Clearly Sodium did not give his true running on this occasion. However, as I selected Charlot- town to win the Newbury race, I must be consistent and take him to come out the better again to- day, particularly as the going may be against Sodium, who is by Psidium, most of whose stock are at their best on firm ground. As between Charlottown and Pretendre, it is probably safest to rely on form shown in the Derby, though Pretendre is reported to have been galloping .with great zest at Newmarket. In. short, I anticipate a repetition of the Epsom result, with Charlottown taken with some confidence to win this afternoon from Pretendre. And for those who insist on a long price, I suggest Hermes as the one most likely to create a surprise. Ion*-fage s18",
