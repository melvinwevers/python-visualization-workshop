   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay and Andrew Baxter BTR, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday launched a Â£1.5bn hostile bid for Hawker Siddeley, the his- toric engineering group which built the Sopwith Camel, the Hurricane and the Harrier jump-jet, capping a remarkable week of UK takeover activity. Hawker rejected the bid, say- ing it had no wish to be part of a sprawling conglomerate. Its share price jumped 118p to 758p, slightly above the value of BTR's offer. BTR's predatory move was the third bid by a conglomer- ate this week, suggesting that enough confidence in recovery has returned to allow a resur- gence of large takeover bids. On Monday, Hanson agreed to pay Â£341m in cash and war- rants for Beazer, the interna- tional building materials group. A day later, Williams Holdings, another conglomer- ate, launched a hostile all- share bid worth Â£701m for Racal Electronics, the data communications and security group. BTR's offer consists of 108 shares plus Â£280.20 in cash for es oel I negabid.....Page 6 anmwagon rol again ...Page 6 Lax ..................................Page 22 every holding of 100 Hawker shares. It values Hawker at 727p, and includes a full cash alternative of 700p a share. Sir Owen Green, BTR chair- man, said Hawker's manage- ment had failed to unlock the company's potential. \"Hawker Siddeley sharehold- ers have endured their com- pany's under-performance for a decade,\" he said. Earnings per share had only risen from 40.1p to 40.8p since 1980. Mr Alan Watkins, Hawker's managing director, who was drafted in to sort out the com- pany's problems, admitted yes- terday that the 1980s had been disappointing. He was brought in from Lucas Industries in 1989 to introduce a five-year restruct- uring plan, slimming down Hawker's product range, cut- ting costs and revitalising management. But the recession has hit Hawker's disposal pro. gramme and diverted manage- ment from long-term planning. \"It is somewhat galling to face this at this time,\" Mr Wat- kins said. \"I am not about to drop this programme half-way through.\" Mr Alan Jackson, BTR chief executive, said he felt Hawker had a number of strong compa- nies in the right geographical areas. He said it had been let down by bad senior manage- ment and starved of funds for capital expenditure. If BTR were successful, it would increase spending on equipment that cut the cost of manufacturing and would probably keep most of the busi- nesses. Mr Jackson said BTR managed rather than traded companies it bought. This approach contrasts with what is often seen as BTR's style of increasing prices in order to increase margins. Hawker Siddeley, one of the most famous names in the UK engineering industry, lost its way in the 1980s while other engineering companies restruc- tured.

   "text_content" : "I By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb, Laura SBliber in Belgrade, and Robert Mauthner in London YUGOSLAVIA yesterday moved closer to civil war as the federal army launched a three-pronged offensive on tar- gets in eastern Croatia to relieve its besieged barracks and reinforce Serb positions in the republic. \"This is the largest co-ordi- nated effort by the army so far,\" said a western diplomat in Belgrade. The attacks by tanks, infan- try and heavy artillery came amid further indications of lack of political control over the federal forces. Last night Mr Stipe Mesic, the federal president of Yugo- slavia, a Croat, called on fed- eral soldiers to desert, saying generals were out of control and waging a dirty war. Earlier, Mr Ante Markovic, the federal prime minister, who is also a Croat, called unsuccessfully for the resigna- tion of Gen Velko Kadijevic, the defence minister, and crit- icised the federal defence min- istry. According to the Belgrade political daily, Borba, Mr Mark- ovic also accused Gen Kadi- jevic of visiting Moscow on March 13 for secret talks with Mr Dmitry Yazov, the former Soviet defence minister, who Yugoslav army loses Its sense of direction....................... Page 2 Wounds run deep ............Page 7 was dismissed after taking part in last month's coup. Accord- ing to the newspaper, Gen Kadijevic gained an \"agree- ment for the delivery of a huge supply of weapons including missile systems, aircraft and helicopters\". Mr Markovic called for a new army leadership, saying that \"otherwise the total collapse of the army and Yugoslavia will be inevitable\". According to Croatian radio, the 20-mile military convoy which left Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, on Thurs- day split into three sections just across the Croatian border and attacked the villages of Tovarnik, Nijemci and Lipovac yesterday afternoon. The interior ministry said the area was in chaos, with air attacks and artillery barrages. The Serbian-led army also sent tanks into the nearby town of Vukovar. A spokesman for the Croatian ministry of information said: \"It looks as though the federal army is going to try to circle around and bite off Vukovar and Osi- jek.\" These two Slavonian towns in eastern Croatia have been practically under siege by Serb paramilitary and federal army units since the beginning of the month. Repeated air raid warnings in Zagreb brought the Croatian capital to a standstill for most of the morning. Fighting also broke out in central and southern Serbia. The central republic of Bos- nia-Herzegovina yesterday ordered a mobilisation of its territorial defence units amid fears that violence would spill on to its territory from neigh- bouring Croatia. No official figure for the number of territorial defence troops in Bosnia was available, but journalists in the republic said they believed they totalled 150,000. Armed civilians yesterday put up barricades to stop mili- tary convoys in the Bosnian towns of Listica and Capljina, 30 miles west of Mostar, raising concern about a possible wid- ening of the conflict to the most ethnically mixed republic which until now has managed to remain on the fringes of the Continued on Page 22 A 100-toot crane collapsed and crashed through the root of a 300-yearoMd Wren church in the City of London yesterday.

   "text_content" : "Yugoslav army loses its sense of direction By Anthony Robinson in London and Laura SlIber in Belgrade THE federal army which yesterday launched another multi-pronged ground assault on Croatia has lost the last ves- tiges of its former all-Yugoslav status and appears to be under no political control. General Veljko Kadijevic, the defence minister, and his deputy, Admiral Stane Brovet, have refused to resign as demanded by Mr Ante Mark- ovic, the federal prime minis- ter, thus underlining the impo- tence of the politicians and the determination of the military to fight their own war. Despite its continuing capac- ity to instill fear, however, the army is a troubled and divided force which has lost political and ideological direction and is having difficulty in recruiting and retaining its troops. Over the last three months, thousands of non-Serb con- scripts have either slipped away or failed to turn up for service. The army can only draw on recruits and reservists from Serbia and Montenegro and can no longer rely on Albanians from Kosovo, whose population growth made them a big part of the annual draft. Over the last three months the army has also lost many non-Serb senior offices such as General Anton Tus, the former head of the air force, and senior naval officers such as Admiral Bozidar Grubisic and Admiral Sveto Letica. During the past week army recruiting officers have even faced an uphill struggle enlist- ing reservists in the Serb vil- lages and small towns most receptive to the state-con- trolled Serbian media's por- trayal of the army as protector of the rights of Serbs against alleged Croat fascists. Although Thursday's parade of tanks and vehicles through Belgrade was applauded by passers-by, the revolt by sev- eral hundred draftees in the small town of Velika Plana, 100km east of the Serbian capi- U WVUaT LU -I IUIIKUVI umwam aaY upa -r ama-u uaW j tal, earlier this week was clear proof that the army's role in the undeclared civil war is far from universally supported. Rather like the senior offl, cers who supported last month's failed coup in the Soviet Union, the army's tough professionals are members of a military caste which has lived in privileged isolation from the rest of society They were indoctrinated to see the army as the guarantor of the integrity of a federal state whose other unifying force was President Josip Tito's version of Balkan com- munism. But not all the officers who originally supported military intervention to keep Slovenia and Croatia in a federal union have been prepared to follow the army leaders down the path which has transformed it to an instrument of greater Serb nationalism. The more intelligent are well aware that Serbia alone could not sustain the cost of such a big and well-equipped army and that a Serbia isolated internationally and forced to hold down large hostile minori- ties within its extended bor- ders would be both unstable and desperately poor. As diplomatic efforts con- tinue to try to stop the fight- ing, it will be to this part of the officer class that negotiators will be directing their appeals for reason.",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, says he wants a union treaty to be signed \"immediately\" by those repub- lics now willing to do so - after which presidential elec- tions should be held. In an informal session with the media, Mr Gorbachev said that under this proposal, \"a political figure enjoying the confidence of the population would already be in place\" before other power structures were developed. He acknowledged there was now \"no [Soviet] centre in the accepted meaning of the word, but there is a danger that 15 [republican] centres will emerge\". These centres of power would be more overbear- ing than the old centre, he said. Mr Gorbachev suggested - but did not elaborate - that the west was prepared to for- give 50 per cent of the Soviet Union's $60bn debt if the money not repaid were spent on fundamental research. How- ever, he was against an inflow of foreign capital, saying were it to be allowed, \"we would be completely bought out\". Instead, the rouble should be made convertible as quickly as possible - \"if we can bring ourselves to carry out unpopu- lar measures\". For himself, he said: \"I have nothing to lose. I am prepared to take the bur- den of the most unpopular decisions in order to come through all of this.\" Let Russia join world economy says Sobchak By Anthony Robinson Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the radical mayor of St Petersburg, yesterday urged Britain and the west to take advantage of the historic opportunity offered by the collapse of communism to re-integrate Russia into the world economy. Speaking at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after talks with Mr John Major, UK prime min- ister, and other senior minis- ters, Mr Sobchak said he had come to London to ask not for aid but for help with privatisa- tion and investment. Mr Sobchak said the sale of surplus European Community food at concessionary prices and other food aid was needed to overcome temporary supply problems. But such food should be sold through the open market along with land and apartments to soak up excess roubles.",

   "text_content" : "By Nell Buckley in Moscow EIGHT out of ten Armenians are expected to back their par- liament's call for independence from the Soviet Union in a ref- erendum in the southern Soviet republic today. The vote coincides with the peace-making mission of Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, and Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, presi- dent of Kazakhstan, to the troubled enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, in Azerbaijan. The dispute over the trou- bled, mainly Armenian terri- tory, which has cost 800 lives in the last three years, and where more than 30 people are believed to have died this week, is one of the main rea- sons why Armenians are likely to opt to go it alone. Surrounded by larger and more powerful Moslem states, Armenia had been considered unlikely to want to sever its ties with the Soviet Union. However frustration with Moscow's handling of the Nag- orno Karabakh dispute, and the belief that it is biased towards the Azerbaijanis, have Ukraine's KGB ceases to exist By Chryaa Freeland in Kiev THE Ukrainian branch of the KGB - historically one of the most ruthless and feared in the Soviet Union - yesterday ceared to exist.

Things have been coming to a head since November 1989, when the USSR Supreme Soviet abolished the Special Administration Committee which was controlling the region, and passed power to an Azerbaijani-dominated Organ- ising Committee. Armenian anger was further fuelled by Moscow's failure to combat the economic blockade of the republic by Azerbaijan, and, this year, by the involve- ment of Soviet troops in the forced repatriation of Armen- ians from Nagorno Karabakh. The chairman of Armenia's parliament, Mr Levon Ter-Pe- trosian, has however indicated that Armenia is likely to sign an economic union treaty with other Soviet republics. The visit of Mr Yeltsin and Mr Nazarbayev to Nagorno Karabakh has been billed as a fact-finding mission. But Yelt- sin aides say he may try to act as a peace-broker in the region.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson ANGRY Russian depaties yesterday rounded on tihgov- ernment of Mr Boris Ytltstn, the Russian president, brand- ing its handling of th6e econ- omy \"unsatisfactory\" and call- ing for the resignation of ministers they said are obstructing reforms. Deputies lined up to attack the Council of Ministers, the Russian federation's executive body, and said they wanted a debate on Mr Yeltsin's recent accretion of powers - which they consider aimed at dimin- ishing their own. The attacks reflect a grow- ing frustration among the dep- uties at Mr Yeltsin's consolida- tion of power, which includes a recent move to send his own envoys to run some Russian districts. Deputies also complained that he was diminishing their ranks by picking his personal staff from among the brightest of the parliament's members. Mr Yeltsin was absent from parliament for the second suc- cessive day, confined to bed with what aides described on Thursday as a mild heart com- plaint. He was none the less due to fly out last night on a mission to start peace talks over the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh in the Transcauca- sus. In his absence, the parlia- ment passed a resolution describing as \"unsatisfactory\" the Council of Ministers' per- formance in carrying out eco- nomic reforms, after backing away from a call for all the ministers to resign. The deputies complained that much of the legislation required to steer the economy towards a market system was on the books, but had then been bogged down by the Council of Ministers' obstruc- tive bureaucracy. \"The supreme power is changing, but the apparatus is not,\" said one deputy. \"It is blocking all the changes.\" Deputies nevertheless backed a resolution calling for Mr Yeltsin to \"reconsider the composition of the Council of Ministers with a view to removing those who are not carrying out the decisions of parliament. They also insisted that Mr Yeltsin present to parliament by November 1 a plan to stabi- lise the economy and move to a market structure. The Council of Ministers looks set for both a purge and a radical pruning if Mr Yeltsin selects Mr Svyatislav Fedorov, an eye surgeon, to replace Mr Ivan Silayev, who quit as Rus- sia's prime minister earlier this week.",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan and David Gardner in Brussels meeting US secretary of state James Baxer to present me views of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on a Middle East peace conference. She told journalists she would rather Palestinians stay away from the conference than agree to Israeli conditions. THE Dutch presidency of the EC will today try to calm fears by southern Community mem- bers that it plans to leave them behind in a two-speed move to economic and monetary union (Emu). At an informal meeting of EC finance ministers at Apel- doom in the Netherlands, Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister, will suggest a system that would broadly allow all 12 members to take part in the final decision to create a mone tary union, but limit by way of treaty \"derogations\", or excep- tions, the role of those coun- tries not immediately adopting the single currency. Earlier this month, several countries, especially Italy, Greece, and Ireland, bridled at the Dutch presidency's pro- posal that only those countries meeting the agreed inflation and budget conditions for Emu would set the rules for manag- ing the currency union. Greece said it feared that first-tier Emu participants might raise unilaterally the economic stan- dard for those joining later. Mr Kok, who said after the somewhat stormy meeting on September 9 that he was open to suggestion, seems now to have in mind a more communi- ty-minded approach, even in the final stage of Emu. But the probable price of this attempt to assuage fears is a series of derogations, delineating the rights of those inside the Emu from those outside it but also making the eventual treaty longer and more complex. Meanwhile, the Dutch cabi- net is putting the finishing touches to its proposals for EC political union over this week- end. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, said after yesterday's cabinet meet- ing- \"We are working on a text acceptable to all our partners.\" However, It is understood that the new plan will not dif- ser greatly from the earlier ver- sion, which has drawn criti- cism from the UK and more muted dissent from France.",

   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagatyl in Tokyo IN THEIR heyday the first warrants ever issued by Nomura Securities, the world's largest stockbroker, were together worth nearly $200m. Yesterday the high-risk, high- reward instruments expired, worthless. Nomura's top 400 executives had little time to mourn the passing of this symbol of the boom in Tokyo's financial mar- kets of the 1980s. They were engaged in all-day meetings for branch managers to debate the company's future in the midst of depression and scandal in the stock market. Mr Hideo Sakamaki, who took over as president when his predecessor resigned in dis- grace less than three months ago, delivered a powerful appeal for effort to rebuild cus- tomer confidence and trust in the market. \"Treat the market price as sacred. Don't distort it. Don't even do anything which might distort it,\" said Mr Sakamaki, in an implied reference to the recent scandals involving bro- kers paying compensation to favoured clients and allegedly manipulating stock prices. Similar appeals were made yesterday at Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, which together with Nomura make up the Big Four stockbroking groups. Branch managers' meetings are held twice yearly and are the head office executives' single best opportunity in which to relay a message to their troops. Yesterday the mood was bleaker than it has been at any time since the 1960s, when the securities industry endured a prolonged recession which brought Yamaichi to the brink of bankruptcy. This week the Big Four said results for the current six- month trading period to the end of September would be the worst since 1965. Yamaichi forecast an Y12bn (Â£52.4m) pre- tax loss and the other compa- nies foresaw profit declines of up to 80 per cent. Branch managers repeatedly asked the same question: \"You tell us to recover trust. But how can we do it?\" Some branches have recalled veterans of the 1960s to advise young sales staff how to cope. The four presidents' speeches were long and fall of exhortation. The main practi- cal proposal was for branch managers to operate more independently, tailoring invest- ment advice to local conditions and local customers' needs. But some managers said this was almost like an admission of defeat from head office. \"It's as if they are telling us that they can't help us,\" said one. So branch managers will have to decide for themselves which products to recommend. Warrants, which are volatile instruments entitling holders to buy shares at a fixed price at a future date, are unlikely to be high on the list.",

Thewestern aliance is already preparing to abandon nuclear shels and short-range missiles. He said that the past few weeks' events in the Soviet Union had speeded up changes in Nato and indicated that ground-launched weapons would be first on the agenda. However, he added that \"there might be a move to reduce the. stockpile\" of aircraft bombs. About 1,600 of the estimated 8,700 US nuclear warheads deployed in Europe are aircraft bombs and depth charges. The remainder are artillery shells and Lance missiles.

Gen Galvin said the plans included air and naval forces for the Nato's new Rapid Reaction Force. This follows agreement ear- lier this year on the outlines of an army Rapid Reaction Corps (RRC) under British command. Gen Galvin, who is also comrn- mander-In-chief of the US European Command, said a US heavy division might be attached to the RRC alongside the UK and mixed European divisions already agreed on. This fifth division would be based in the US with \"pre-lo- cated sites\" in Europe. Two other. US army divisions, at lower states of readiness, are due to remain in Germany as part of the new multinational corps structure. The Rapid Reaction Force was designed for flexibility, Gen Galvin said. Nato would in future aim to work with other organisations - such as the United Nations, the Western European Union, the European Community and the Confer- ence on Security and Co-opera- tion in Europe - in seeking to manage crises.",

   "article_dc_title" : "IFC Draws up Worldwide Growth Strategy",
   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington INTERNATIONAL Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank affiliate devoted to private sector investment in the developing world, has drawn up a new growth strategy for the coming decade, aimed at fostering the development of capital markets, privatisation, small business expansion and infrastructure projects. IFC is virtually assured of a $lbn (Â£500m) equity increase to take its capital to $2.3bn although this must still be formally approved by member countries over the next six to nine months. Sir William Ryrie, the organisation's executive vice-president, estimates that this capital increase will enable IFC to boost its annual level of investment from around $1.5bn a year today to $4bn a year by 1998. Although IFC expects to maintain strong investment growth in all the regions in which it operates, expansion is likely to be particularly strong in central and eastern Europe and in sub-Saharan Africa. The Washington-based organisation expects a near tripling of its financing in Europe to some $500m a year by the turn of the century, with $300m to $350m devoted to projects in central and eastern Europe. Loan and investment approvals in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to double to around $400m. IFC anticipates a 60 per cent increase in its financing activities in Asia and a 70 per ceht increase in Latin America, which currently account for more than two thirds of its loans and investments between them. Sir William said recent deregulation in India had opened the way for IFC to play a bigger role there, and the country was likely to be one of IFC's biggest customers in coming years. One of IFC's priorities is the growth of capital markets and financial institutions in developing countries. \"Everybody concerned with development has become very much aware that you cannot have a strong, healthy and growing private sector without a strong, healthy financial sector,\" Sir William commented. Besides helping developing countries to develop their own stock markets, he said IFC would try to enable individual companies in the developing world to raise money on the international markets by helping with syndications and securities issues. IFC says that foreign direct investment in developing countries totalled around $19.9bn last year, but at the same time portfolio investment in these countries has been steadily growing to an estimated $1bn to $2bn a year. Total equity holdings by non-residents in emerging markets are estimated at $17bn. Sir William said he also expected IFC to be involved in around 100 privatisations over the next five years, both in eastern Europe and in other regions. Small businesses will also remain a priority as the \"seed corn\" of a strong private sector, and IFC plans to provide money and mobilise funds from international markets for large infrastructure projects, which are often viewed as risky by private investors. IFC invested $1.54bn in 152 projects during its fiscal year to June 30, compared with $1.51bn in 122 projects the previous year.",

   "text_content" : "WESTERN aid donors yesterday pledged $6.7bn (Â£3.96bn) in aid to India, to help the stricken economy through its balance of payments crisis and to support its wide-ranging economic reforms, writes William Dawkins from Paris. The package - worth 6 per cent more than last year's assistance - was agreed at a meeting of the World Bank's India consortium. More than the government had expected, it sends a message of confidence to international capital markets, according to Mr S.P. Shukla, finance secretary. A $1.8bn injection is also expected from the International Monetary Fund. Together, these will go a long way towards meeting the $9.2bn India needs this year to cover an expected $6bn current account deficit and $3.2bn of debt repayments. The country's need for assistance has been exacerbated by fears over its creditworthiness that have severely limited its access to commercial loans. There were concerns in India that an inadequate aid agreement would force the government to impose tougher import curbs to avoid a loan default. An unusually large part of yesterday's package, $2.3bn, is to cover emergency balance of payments needs. India's foreign exchange reserves currently cover just one month's imports needs. The package is the equivalent of another month's import bill, said officials. Western donors agreed that India needed emergency support to tide it over while the impact of the cut in this year's budget deficit - from 9 per cent to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product - fed through to the balance of payments, said officials. Individual governments pledged $2.2bn, with the biggest contributions coming- from Japan, Germany and Britain, said Mr Shaukla. The remaining $4.5bn came mainly from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington A SPLIT has emerged within the Bush administration over how to force Iraq to comply with UN resolutions mandat- ing the destruction of its nuclear, chemical and biologi- cal weapons arsenal. General Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President George Bush, is understood to be the leading hawk. The National Security Council staff was responsible for drafting plans to send US jet fighters to provide air cover to UN helicopters seek- ing access to Iraq's suspected unconventional weapons sites. The White House, looking ahead to Mr Bush's keynote foreign policy address to the UN on Monday, wanted to make a political point: the need to enforce United Nations resolutions to strengthen the UN's credibility. The Pentagon is taking a more cautious approach. Mr Dick Cheney, defence secre- tary, and General Colin Pow- ell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, were unhappy about this week's heavily pub- licised threat to move squad- rons of fighters to the Gulf if Iraq failed to grant access to UN inspection teams. The resulting divisions pro- voked a conciliatory White House statement which said no decision had been taken to dispatch forces to the Gulf. The differences which sur- faced this week are about tac- tics more than goals. The Pen- tagon, White House and State Department all agree that President Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue to defy the UN. Mr Bush told a Republican fund-raising event in Los Angeles on Thursday night that other countries - believed to be Britain and France - would support the enforcement of UN sanctions. But he said this would not be \"Son of Desert Storm\" and there was no threat of the Gulf war resuming. The consensus among hawks and those who favour a less aggressive stance is that, with Mr Saddam in power, the pro- cess of inspecting and destroy- ing Iraq's arsenal would take months, if not years.",

   "text_content" : "By John Grilith MR VICTOR GAUNTLETT resigned yesterday as chair- man and chief executive of Aston Martin. He was the lat- est in a line of \"white-knight\" entrepreneurs who have res- cued the luxury carmaker at various stages in its 77-year history. His resignation took immedi- ate effect, but Mr Gauntlett, 49, insisted that he had not fallen out with Ford, which acquired a 75 per cent stake in the Aston Martin Lagonda Group in 1987. Mr Gauntlett retains a 125 per cent stake in the company, while 12.5 per cent is held by the Livanos Greek shipping family. Mr Peter Livanos, a partner with Mr Gauntlett in rescuing Aston Martin from the brink of receivership in 1981, is still on the board. Mr Gauntlett's replacement as chairman is Mr Walter Hayes, 67, who was once editor-in-chief of the Sunday Dispatch newspaper. He joined Ford in 1961, played a signifi- cant role in launching its world motorsport programme and became a vice-president of Ford US. Mr Hayes retired as vice- chairman of Ford of Europe two years ago and 'was appointed to Aston Martin's board in 1990. Mr Gauntlett, who has been known to describe Mr Hayes since the Ford takeover as \"my fairy godmother\", welcomed the appointment. Mr Gauntlett's resignation comes at a low point in the recent history of the company, which is based at Newport Pag- nell, Buckinghamshire. It lost E1.98m in the year to December 31 1990, and the world market for luxury cars has become substantially more difficult since then. The company has announced 135 redundancies this year, reducing the work- force to 400. It has also laid off production workers, and pro- duction of its Â£125,000 Virage car has been cut to three a week. Mr Gauntlett said the deci- sion had been one of the most difficult he had faced. \"This is not just a job, it's a cause,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, as I told Ford in June, I felt that I have reached my 'sell-by date as far as this company is concerned\". Mr Gauntlett expressed regret that the expansion he envisaged in the early 1980s had not happened. He had hoped to build a cheaper Aston Martin, in volumes of about 300 to 700 a year and costing about Â£85,000 at current prices. Lack of investment kept the target date for the launch of such a car - codenamed Projf ect DB1999 - rolling forward. Mr Gauntlett said yesterday that the car was closer to becoming reality than at any time in his history with the company, with a possible launch in 1994. Mr Gauntlett expected Aston Martin under wholly Ford management to be able to stay \"true to its roots\" as a tradi- tional luxury carmaker. He was not dismayed at the con- cept of the company's under- taking additional activities. One idea previously discussed at the time of the takeover, but not apparently followed through, was that Aston might build bodies on the platform and running gear of US Ford vehicles such as the Lincoln, but for north American mar- kets only. Mr Gauntlett, who is also chairman of Proteus Petro- leum, which he set up, said last night he was going to \"take a break\" before deciding his next career step.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4 televi- sion, said last night that he had asked for compensation for deciding to stay at the channel and removing himself from the job market. Mr Grade said that he approached his chairman, Sir Richard Attenborough, long before he received lucrative offers to leave the station and lead a bid for an ITV franhise in the current competitive ten- dering run room Mr Grde said at a Royal Television Society Convention in Cambridge that he had told Sir Richard \"If I am going to take myself off the market I think we should have negotia- tions. I didn't want the market rate. But I would like you to make me an offer.' He made me an offer and I accepted. Thmere were no negotiations,\" Mr Grade added.

Mr Grade last night described the reported sums as \"guesswork\", but declined to say what the precise figure was. He said the details would be properly disclosed in Chan- nel 4's next annual report. Mr Grade is believed to have turned down an offer of more than Elm to head the Carlton Communications bid for the weekday fanchise in the Lon- don area, now held by Thames Television. Sir Richard Attenborough has defended the payments to the senior Channel 4 execu- tives on the ground that it was commercially necessary to retain top management talent at a time when higher ofers hom outside were expected.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper and Norma Cohen A GROUP of Lloyd's Names yesterday won a significant victory in their legal battle against the Corporation of Lloyd's, the body that organ- ises the insurance market's affairs. The 24 Names - wealthy individuals whose capital backs the market - were members of syndicates man- aged by the Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency in the early 1980s. They allege that negligence by the corporation was responsible for insurance losses of more than Â£5m. Yesterday three Appeal Court judges ruled that when the Names' case against Lloyd's resumes in January, the courts will be allowed to see evidence which, the Names claim, shows the extent to which Lloyd's was aware of Oakeley Vaughan's dealings. Four underwriting syndi- cates managed in the early 1980s by the Oakeley Vaughan agency - now liquidated - suffered losses of Â£30m to Â£35m. More than 250 Names were originally members of the syndicates. This is the first time in the market's 300-year history that it has been sued by Names. They allege that Lloyd's was in breach of its duties to Names r under contract, statutory and a common law, and are seeking a damages as well as an indem- i nity against future claims that may be filed against their syn- v dicate. c Lloyd's had sought to have a the case focus solely on the I issue of whether it had any i legal duty of care to the z Names. Lloyd's has denied hav- ing any such duty. a Among the pieces of evi- g dence now to be entered with b the court will be a report, com- c missioned by Lloyd's, into the i affairs of Oakeley Vaughan. r The names allege that Lloyd's S never made the results avail able to them, and instead reas- sured them that its inquiries were of a routine nature. Lloyd's said the corporation would not comment on the case but said its solicitors were studying the judgment. Lloyd's has in the past insisted that it will fight the case to its ulti- mate conclusion. Oakeley Vaughan managing agency, originally part of a group that owned a Lloyd's broker, managed four syndi- cates specialising in aviation, marine and non-marine busi- ness. It was led by Mr Charles St George, a former Cold- stream guardsman and race- horse owner, and developed a glamorous image, attracting celebrities such as Mr Henry Cooper, the boxer, to be direc- tors of its broking company. The Names allege that Lloyd's knew as early as 1981 that the syndicates were break- ing market regulations, among other things by \"overwriting\", or writing more premiums than they are allowed to do under Lloyd's rules. Even so, it was in November 1982 that Lloyd's decided to withdraw permission from the managing agents to manage the syndicates.",

   "text_content" : "Richard Evans visits Folkestone, which is about to lose the passing trade the ferry traffic brings SIGNS of crisis were hard to detect in Folkestone yesterday as holiday- makers e=noyed the sunshine and the container lorries rum- bled down to the docks. But crisis there is, after the announcement by Sealink Stena Line this week that Folkestone's role as a ferry port is to end in December. After 160 years of transporting people to and from France, it will become a port without a purpose. It is not the closure itself that has caused anger and bit- terness, however. That was widely accepted as inevitable with the development of the Channel tunnel It is the tim- ing of the closure that has caused consternation. Sealink always said it planned to close the Folke- stone-Boulogne route when the Channel tunnel opened because its relatively low vol- ume of traffic would fall to a level where it would become unviable. Yet the assumption was that Sealink, the only ferry com- pany operating out of Folke- stone, would be able to keep the port going until the tunnel opened around mid 1993. Local plans for job creation and infrastructure develop- ment have been based on that belief. Mr Mike Luck, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrat-domi- nated Shepway district council, which is centred on Folke- stone, said: \"We are bitterly disappointed that it has hap- pened two years earlier than planned. There is little the council can do in an emer- gency like this. It needs much longer than three months' notice to meet such a crisis.\" The impact on the town will certainly be serious. Folke- stone has always relied heavily on the harbour for its com- merce, and many businesses depend on ferry passengers for passing trade. Pubs and small shops around the harbour have been kept afloat by trade from some of thei Sealtlik person- nel, plus another 240O at the docks, who will lose their jobs on December 1. Unemployment in Shepway was running at 8.7 per cent before the announcement, and numbers out of work have dou- bled in the last two years. Mr Luck said: \"This has ripped the heart out of employ- ment in the district, and there is nothing to MIl the gap.\" A further complication is that the Channel tunnel proj- ect has employed a lot of local labour, but that has now peaked and will decline in the next 18 months before the tun- nel opens. The town's biggest hotel, the Burstin, sends an average of 700 people a week on tferry day- trips to Boulone , It employs more than 300 local people and has a high occupancy rate. Mr Tom Kililea, general manager, said the Sealink announce- ment was \"a total disaster\" for an area that had little else to keep it going, apart from tour- ism. \"The future is not looking good in the short term,\" he said. This is the key to Folke- stone's position. In the medium term, with the opening of the tunnel terminal - already a big local landmark in white concrete - and the develop- ment of substantial local pro- jects, including a marina, the outlook is good. It is in the next three to five years that the outlook remains bleak for the unemployed and for the local economy. Mr Tony Bertin, chairman of Folkestone's Chamber of Com- merce and Industry and a local solicitor, is optimistic about the future, once the present employment crisis is overcome. He said: \"Ultimately, the plans for a marina and harbour development will benefit Fol- kestone much more than two ferries operating a rather restricted service, and Folke- stone will be a net beneficiary from the Channel tunnel.\" He also accepts that the ferry companies, Seallnk'Stena and P&O, have little alterna- tive but to concentrate their resources on the short Dover- Calais route in order to provide effective competition to the tunnel, which is expected to cut fares significantly to attract volume traffic. Dover's enclosed harbour has much better facilities than Folkestone and it is able to take the new jumbo ser- ries, which give economies of scale. The best hope now lies in speeding up development plans already in hand, particularly the marina, and in pressing for more aid, possibly by turnig east Kent into an assisted areWL Sea Containers, the company that sold Sealink to the Swed- ish Stena group 18 months ago, still owns Folkestone harbour and has put forward proposals to fill in much of the inner harbour in order to build a marina, housing, shops and other leisure facilities. A small fishing harbour will also remain. A private bill is now before parliament and the company hopes to start work on the project in 1993 and complete it in 1995. Now that the harbour will be vacated by the ferries earlier than planned, the hope is that the project can be advanced. It would mean not only more jobs but a spin-off throughout the local economy as compa- nies move in to service the marina and its patrons. The docks closure also faces the local MP with a dilemma. He is Mr Michael Howard, who also happens to be secretary for employment, and there is a feeling that if he cannot bring some solace to his constituents in the form of new jobs, he might receive a nasty shock at the next election. As one of his constituents remarked: \"Never mind Howard's Way. It could be Howard's End.\" I *w IE Competition: a Sealink ferry passes the entrance to the Channel tunnel near Calais . ..

   "article_dc_title" : "Air Price War May Hole the Bucket Shops",
   "text_content" : "David Churchill and Andrew Jack on BA's move to cut its US fares UY AN economy British Airways return fare to New York today for travel next week and it will cost Â£578. Give a week's notice, and an Apex fare for the same journey will cost Â£38E. But wait until the beginning of next month, and any high street travel agent will sell - with BA's blessing - the same ticket for Â£270 or less. BA's decision this week to recognise officially the unoffi- cial practice of selling unsold airline seats at a discount her- alds the start of the fiercest airline price war ever on the crucial north American routes. The cause is the threat to BA's traditional 40 per cent market dominance across the north Atlantic from new com- petition from airlines such as United and American. The arrival of these aggressive competitors - replacing the troubled Pan Am and TWA air- lines - has coincided with the effects of the Gulf war and recession on both sides of the Atlantic. Those effects have led to airlines flying with loads at least 4 per cent down on this time last year. There is simply too much capacity chasing too few customers. The result is that flying to New York and some other US lAaino+inn Me- destinations has never been cheaper. It might also spell the end of the \"bucket shops\" the shady world of cheap airline ticket outlets that have tradition- ally provided budget-con- scious travel- lers with the cheapest possible air fares. The term \"bucket shops\" was first coined at a trade con- ference in the early 1970s and comes from an old Stock Exchange expression for sell- ing almost worthless shares \"by the bucketful\". The somewhat unorthodox way in which such airline tick- ets were sold originated after the post-war establishment of international conventions regulating air travel and fares. The reason for them was to improve safety standards, but one effect has been to keep prices artificially high on many routes. The introduction of larger aircraft, such as Boeing 747s, in the 1970s meant that meet airlines were unable to fill every seat at regular prices. Virtually all airlines were pre- pared to make available unsold :conomy seats, even though it was ostensibly illegal, to so-called consolidators agents who were prepared to take a risk on buying and reselling them at a profit. Because many at the earliest discounted tickets were made available to ethnic groups seeking to visit their native country, bucket shop earned a reputation for being set up above shops in Chinese or Asian communitie. The rea- tive lack of sophistication of Flying to New York and some other US destinations has never been cheaper customers also provided ample opportunities for unscrupulous operators, creating a poor image for the business. In reality, most high street travel agents have had access to discounted air fares for many years but have been reluctant to promote them for fear that it would damage their mainstream business. However, other specialist operators such as Trailfinders and STA Travel have entered the market, offering a reputa- ble service from high-street locations. Mr Tony Russell, deputy managing director of Trailfinders, believes that the public is more aware of the risks of going to discount-seat operators that are not mem- bers - and therefore not bonded - of either the Associ- ation of British Travel Agents or the International Air Trans- port Association. Estimates suggest that about 7m passengers on outward flights from UK airports each year are travelling on tickets costing up to 70 per cent less than the published price. Reputable discount-seat operators believe that the BA move is more of a publicity gimmick than a real incursion into their territory. They point out that brokinw seats at such narrow profit margins requires exten- sive experience of the market not available to most travel agents. For consum- ers, the BA move reinforces the concept that cheap fares are available. Thomas Cook's best price yesterday to New York, for example, was Â£291 return, flying on Kuwaiti Air- ways, but only on restricted days and for a limited period. Other fares to New York on BA show the wide variation that still exists: ranging from Â£249 from American Fly Drive through to S279 from USAir- tours. Although BA expects to sell its excess seats at a retail price of about Â£270, some agen- cies are rumoured to be pre- pared to cut the price to about Â£200. Discount-seat operators, however, warn that bargain fares are available only to trav- ellers who can be flexible in their arrangements. They admit that seats are not always available at the advertised low prices. The Consumers' Associ- ation warns against agents who say no cheap seats are left and try to sel tickets at higher prices. \"Shop around\" is the association's advice. In the short term, most travel industry analysts expect the discount price war to be short and sharp, making the next few months robab he best time to to the US. In the longer term, however, BA's decision to bring dis- counts into the open may lead to continued pressure for lower fares in Europe as well as across the Atlantic.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack and Andrew Taylor A 300-YEAR-OLD church in the City of London designed by Sir Christopher Wren suffered serious damage yesterday when a 100-ft crane collapsed and crashed through its roof. Architects at the site said that repairs to St James Church, Garlickhythe, built in 1682, would take more than a year to complete and might cost more than Elm. No one was hurt except the crane driver, who escaped seri- ous injury when he jumped clear as the crane fell. He was later released from hospital. The crane was working on an SE0m l0-torey offce -devel- opment in the City near South- wark Bridge. The accident hap pened about 7.30am, an hour after work had begun on site. \"At this stage we do not know why this happened,\" said Laing Management, the con- tractors, part of the John Laing construction group. \"A thor- ough investigation is under way.\" Both Laing and the Health and Safety Executive will produce reports on the incident. The area was sealed off, causing serious traffic conges- tion. City of London police said they expected a stretch of Upper Thames Street to remain closed until Monday morning while the crane is removed. Inside the church damage was severe. A buckled part of the crane lay surrounded by splintered wood and dust. The original 1682 pews were destroyed, and all that remained of a Â£75,000 English crystal chandelier was the chain that used to support it. The crane crashed through into burial areas below the church. \"It's devastating . . aw- ful,\" said the Rev John Paul, the rector, who learnt of the accident at 7.45am. \"I've almost lost my voice and I'm still in a state of shock. My mind keeps going back to the thought that thankfully no one was hurt.\" Mr Michael Giles, an interior designer who had only recently finished a Â£230,000 restoration project on the church, said: \"This is tragic.\" He said it was too early to tell how seriously the roof had been affected, and added: \"It is a miracle there was not more damage.\" He said the destruction was similar to that caused when an unex- ploded bomb crashed through the roof of the church in 1941. The crane avoided the main rafters in the roof and passed between the two main support pillars on the south side of the church. Dr David Hope, the bishop of London, said: \"It really is an enormous tragedy to have affected one of Sir Christopher Wren's most magnificent cre- ations.\" The church is home to the traditionalist Prayerbook Soci- ety, and uses only the 1660 Book of Common Prayer in its services.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Looking past the Recovery",
   "text_content" : "THE BANK of England is not yet independent. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton remains a politically appointed servant of the crown and the UK is mired in a phoney election war. Little wonder, then, that his observa- tion that the recovery was under way, in itself neither interesting nor particularly controversial, was deemed by the opposition to be wildly par- tisan. That is, after all, its job. The governor has a job to do also: not to be an economic pundit, but instead to keep reminding all who will listen that the battle against inflation will only be won when UK inflation has been brought down to the lowest European levels and kept there. This was the message of his speech this week. It was a good speech. He should deliver it again and again. Labour's annoyance at the governor's comments was, in any case, over-done. So far, economic recovery is some- thing talked about only by some economists and the occa- sional speech-writer. Voters are probably not very impressed either way. The frenetic campaigning of the last week indicates that the government is determined to be ready to pounce when the economic numbers and polls point to a Conservative vic- tory. And Labour will not be caught on the hop. Yet the economic data still suggest that the election may come later rather than sooner. There is a growing feeling that the economy is beginning to turn in the government's favour, hence Labour's annoy- ance at the governor's com- ments. But the risk of unwel- come bad news may remain too high. Last week's economic data argue for continued caution. Manufacturing output rose in July for the second consecutive month. Output was higher in the three months to July com- pared to the previous three months, a clear sign that the recession is ending. Consumer uneasiness Yet overall production was 4% per cent lower than a year ago; and companies are con- tinuing to reduce their sinan- cial deficits by reducing invest- ment and employment. Unemployment is still rising at too fast a rate, particularly in the south, for the government to feel comfortable about going to the polls. More important, the combination of rising unemployment, high real inter- est rates and rising house repossessions continues to shake consumer confidence. Retail sales fell sharply and unexpectedly in August, after two months of growth. A sustained rise in consumer spending is also a pre-condi- tion of a recovery in business spending. The stock market has climbed by 21 per cent this year in anticipation of a recov- ery in profits; and a renewed bout of takeover activity may signal higher confidence, at least among City predators. But last week's mixed eco- nomic news did not inspire the market, with the FT-SE 100 index closing down 1 per cent on the week. Perhaps stock market ana- lysts have read the entire text of the governor's speech, rather than the Dqwning Street sound-bites. The onset of recov- ery is all well and good, he argued, but \"the crucial con- cern now is that recovery should be sustainable\". Wage bargaining Much depends on the atti- tude of wage bargainers. Pay settlements in manufacturing are falling faster than expec- ted: the Confederation of Brit- ish Industry expects settle- ments in the third quarter to fall below 6 per cent. Slower growth of average earnings and a pick-up in productivity have cut the growth rate of unit labour cost in half in just three months. Yet this is no reason for complacency. UK pay settle- ments may be below those in Germany at the height of the German boom. But German inflation is unlikely to remain above 2 per cent for very long. The fact remains, as France can testify, that UK pay settle- ments have probably only fallen about half as far as they must if British industry is merely to hold its ground in the ERM, let alone to offset the losses of the past year. On present trends, the growth of UK average earnings must fall to below 5 per cent and pay settlements to 3 per cent next year. Their lowest levels in the 1980s were 6.9 and 4.8 per cent respectively. The ERM makes a continued fall in pay settlements not just desirable but inevitable. It will occur through squeezed profits and rising unemployment unless the pattern of UK wage bargaining changes. There is little sign of a change so far. The rise in unemployment in the current recession is so far almost identical with what happened in 1980-81. But in 1980, the level of pay settle- ments fell by 41 per cent com- pared to 25 per cent since June of last year. The recovery may well be with us. Mr Major will surely hope so. But it is too early to celebrate. The adjustment to the harsh facts of life within the European exchange rate mechanism has only just begun. The recovery may well be long, slow and unexciting.",

Last Decem- ber he mile the blunder - ap he now describes it - of telling the press that he was going for a big acquisition. \"I've lived with that for nine bloody months,\" he said yesterday. \"But I think this one should suit\" The one in question, yesterday's Â£1.5bn hostile bid for Hawker Sidde- ley, should be big enough for anyone. It is also, according to Mr Jackson, a classic case for the BTR treatment: a business with good products, market shares and technology, but short of management and capital invistment. Put in the right people, drive costs down, and you have a re-run of great BTR acquisitions of the past such as Dunlop and Thomas Tilling. Be that as it may, the bid is not quite as advertised. Under Mr Jack- son, BTR has been out to change its image from pure industrial manager to a more aggressive asset broker in the Hanson mould. But there seems little scope for asset-stripping here. \"I wouldn't expect to be disposing of much,\" Mr Jackson said yesterday. \"The whole objective is to manage this group.\" Similarly, BTR has always laid great stress on price rises as a way of improving margins in the businesses it acquires. But many of Hawker's markets are so brutally competitive as to make that out of the question. It is also rather unexpected that BTR should be assaulting a grand old name of British industry in this fash- ion. Its highly public failure to take over just such another famous name in 1986, the glassmaker Pilkington, is still a sore topic for the company. So is last year's equally public and abor- tive bid for the US group Norton. It can scarcely afford to fail again. The resulting puzzlement was neatly reflected yesterday in the BTR share price. The market is well aware that acquisition is BTR's lifeblood. The promised bid has been awaited with corresponding impatience. But when it was duly revealed yesterday, BTR's share price fell by 3 per cent. Mr Jackson, naturally enough, dis- putes all this. The failure to secure Pilkington and Norton does not mean that BTR must get Hawker at any price. \"We lost both opportunities, in my view, because our character came through very clear - that we weren't prepared to pay too much.\" Nor is Hawker an unexpected tar- get. \"We see it as nothing more than a business like others we've acquired. It's had a long history of disappoint- ment. In 1985, Dunlop was another company which the market was con- vinced couldn't perform. And yet there was underlying technology and process there, and its performance became very satisfactory for us. We It is rather easier to become senti- mental about the public image of Hawker Siddeley - a great Brit- ish eigineering institution whose heyday was an era when cars were called motors - than to wax lyrical about the present company. For the public, Hawker was the company which produced the Hurri- cane fighter aircraft, the Armstrong Siddeley car, and, in the 1960s, the Harrier jump-jet. Few remember that the company's UK aerospace interests were nationalised in 1977. City types with long memories might recall that the company was one of the first constituents of the FT Ordinary Share Index, which began in 1935 - the same year that Hawker was formed from a collection of famous names such as Armstrong Whitworth and Gloster Aircraft. Hawker shared a place in that index with other manufacturers which have long since lost their inde- pendence - such as Austin Motor - and several more that have not, nota- bly GEC, GKN and Vickers. see this one as an extension of that.\" But what is the scope for price increases? \"We wouldn't know that. We're not close enough to it, and won't be until we get in and look at the management and review the busi- nesses. We find that with most of the operations we've acquired in the past there's been something on price, but mainly it's been to do with manufac- turing cost reductions. A fair percent- age of that is generally associated with the necessity for -,,ital invest- ment. It's not uncommon in our expe- rience with this type of company to find they've been starved of very cru- cial capital spends.\" The charge is disputed by Hawker. Its chief executive remarked acidly yesterday: \"The question for us is not doubling the spend, but spending it smartly.\" But for Mr Jackson, the point is crucial. \"Our style of profit planning involves our managers sitting down When the bid was duly revealed yesterday, BTR's share price fell by 3 per cent with the day-to-day managers of each of the operations and talking about their business. Without exception, when you're talking to the guy who has been starved of his capital invest- ment, he knows exactly what he needs to get productivity up and man- ufacturing costs out. We encourage him to bring that forward in these conversations - to tell us what he really wants. That's the most motiva- ting thing for managers generally. Manufacturing people love to have state-of-the-art equipment.\" But there is no question of Hawker being treated in a hands-off fashion. \"It's very, very important for us that we only move on something when we've got the management resource in place. The key to BTR's past suc- cess is the ability to grow margins fast, and that's happened because we've been able to move the manage- ment in very quickly.\" This naturally raises the question of how far down the Hawker organisa- tion the heads would roll. Again, Mr Jackson says, he doesn't know yet. \"The first thing we'll do is go.out and visit the plants. We'll try to visit all the major operations within the first few weeks. Out of that will come an opportunity to talk to the very top management and the operating chief executives of these businesses. Out of that emerges the layer of manage- ment which is ongoing. \"Normally, that's middle manage ment. We usually find middle manag ers extremely strong. They're the guys that know the business. They're the ones who will react to positive business plans and will enjoy the opportunity to be decision-makers.\" In Mr Jackson's repeated insistence on cost-saving as the key to margin improvement, there is a hint of inter- nal conflict over BTR's philosophy. The group's past insistence on price increases is legendary. FT journalists are used to being quizzed by Sir Owen Green, BTR's chairman, on why the newspaper's cover price is not dou- bled overnight. Mr John Cahill, Mr Jackson's predecessor as chief execu- tive who is still on the board, did just that with the prices of a US car com- ponents manufacturer which the group acquired in 1989. \"I'm not sure what John did,\" Mr Jackson says cautiously. \"I can only say from experience that margin improvement in the businesses we've acquired hasn't generally been price driven. It's been efficiency-driven.\" It is not clear if there is enough scope for increased efficiency in Hawker's operations for BTR to cover the cost of acquisition in the first year of ownership. The market leans to the sceptical view that if not, BTR will be able to make good the shortfall by quarrying the rich seam of acquisition accounting. In the old days, BTR might have been thought less likely than most conglomerates to resort to such methods. But as the furore over the methods used to inflate its interim profits a fortnight ago demonstrated, Mr Jackson is seen as more aggres- sive in this field as in others. Throughout all this, Mr Jackson is keen to dispel the idea that Hawker is essential to BTR's future. As he points out, BTR made three acquisi- tions in 1989, and has made three sub- stantial ones this year already: Conti- nental PET in the US for $150m, Smorgon, an Australian glass com- pany, for A$170m, and the UK glass maker Rockware for around Â£200m. He concedes, though, that Hawker belongs to a series of mega-deals that takes in Thomas Tilling in 1983, Dun- lop in 1985 and ACI of Australia in 1988. If he gets it, will it be enough for the foreseeable future? \"When we've got it,\" he says firmly, \"we'll be busy for up to six months correcting it. Beyond that, we wouldn't want to speculate on what we do next. But this'll keep us out of mischief for a while.\" the future for Hawker - reshaping It, reducing costs and beginning what Mr Watkins calls a \"massive amount of internal training\" - the new man- aging director and his team have had to grapple with the short-term effects of the recession. Consequently, the disposals that Hawker might have been able to make in a better economic climate have either been delayed or proved impossible. It has not been for want of trying - there have been plenty of discussions, says Mr Watkins. MIr Watkins is clearly irritated by a bid that comes about two years into an extensive five-year restructuring plan, and says he is the sort of person who derives satisfaction from taking a job through to its conclu- sion. In retrospect given the recession, he says, he would have liked to have began the restructuring three or four years earlier. So was 1989 too late for Hawker to bring in an outsider? \"That is bound to be a reasonable accusation,\" says Mr Salt.",

   "text_content" : "Andrew Baxter examines Hawker Siddeley's 'albatross' For younger brokers, though, Hawker is a rather boring hotch- potch of electrical businesses which failed to take advantage of the good times in the mid-1980s and - uniquely for a big British engineer- ing concern - came out of the 1980s in much the same shape as it went in. The Hawker Siddeley that emerged from the Callaghan government's nationalisation programme has found it hard to live up to some of the great achievements of its past. The disad- vantages of a deeply-ingrained engi- neering culture, according to most observers, more than outweighed the benefits. By the mid-1980s, the strong repu- tation of products ranging from small motors to locomotives and heavy electricity supply equipment was off- set by backward manufacturing tech- niques and a confused organisational structure. A Â£300m campaign of spending in the late 1980s to move away from mechanical to electrical engineering products seemed only to exacerbate a problem that Hawker's forbears might have found hard to compre- hend. In global markets, the company was simply in too many businesses to maintain its market shares and finance the technology advances needed to remain competi- tive. Mr Tim Sallit, a main board direc- tor of Hawker Siddeley until he retired last year, says the board was aware eight years ago that it had to dispose of non-core businesses and buy others to generate cash. \"Yet only five years ago diversifica- tion was being hailed by the outside world as our strength. It is now seen as the company's albatross,\" he adds. In May 1989, the task of taking Hawker into the 1990s with a more focused product line, an updated atti- tude to manufacturing and a more cohesive approach to developing management skills was given to Mr Alan Watkins, who had made a name for himself at Lucas Aerospace. A few months after settling in, Mr Watkins made it clear he was not too impressed by much of what he had seen, and set in train a strategic review of the entire business.

   "text_content" : "Britain is the last adventure playground for corporate predators, writes John Plender ine months ago the City of London's great stage army of takeover specialists was wringing its hands over the dearth of bid activity. Today the fee income of banks, lawyers and a wider supporting cast that makes its living out of the peculiarly Anglo-Saxon habit of deal-mak- ing stands to be greatly enhanced by a sudden spate of bids, both agreed and con- tested. The combined value of three high-profile offers this week amounted to more than Â£2%bn in cash and paper. What has caused the takeover bandwagon to roll again? And are we at the start of another bid boom that could ultimately rival that of the late 1980s? In theory businessmen might be expected to buy assets indi- rectly through takeovers when share prices are low and to invest directly in physical assets such as plant and machinery when stock markets are high. In practice, they obey their instincts and follow the logic of individual deals. That appears invariably to mean that there is a cyclical increase in takeovers when shares turn up in anticipation of recovery while profits remain down in response to recession. Hence the latest flurry of bid announcements. Corporate opportunists are on the march; and it bhas, as in the past, been acase of rounding up the usual suspects. The acquisitive con- glomerates such as Hanson, BTR and Williams Holdings are at the forehot of activity, having rediscovered a confi- dence that was lading at the start of the yer when the Gulf war was stil loomlin But to the Inocent obmrver such bargain-hunting might asem to beg the question.

UK wage inflation has been running well above the average ERM level, implying deteriorating compet- itiveness against Britain's part- ners in the Community. The longer it takes for UK wage inflation to converge with Britain's European partners, the more protracted will be the period of low growth and disin- flation. For that reason alone it will be a longer, harder slog to improve the profitability of British manufacturing - a point that must be of relevance to bids such as BTR's for Hawker Siddeey. Equally problematic is the Iy high level of debtedns in the personal Sector, which points to a very ingerly return of consumer alsences.

As the chart clearly indicates, takeover activity reached historically freakish levels in the second half of the 1980s, with cash bids accounting for a dispro- portionately large share of the consideration. That partly reflected excessive expansion of money and bank credit, which continued after the stock market crash of 1987 when banks looked to would-be predators as a lucrative new source of business, with devas- tating effects in liberal Anglo-Saxon capital markets. Today the banks are more cautious and their balance sheets are constrained by the new capital adequacy rules imposed under the aegis of the Bank for International Settle- ments. Junk bonds, which financed many of the excesses of the 1980s boom, are not on offer. Many of the biggest take- over operators - Australian entrepreneurs, newspaper tycoons, growth-hungry retail- ers - have gone bust or pulled in their horns. More orthodox industrialists are still too busy managing their way out of recession to have time to con- template acquisitions. Por the moment, then, this looks like a more normal take- over cycle.

One is that the main predators have grown egr since the earlier Is9s an need bigger acquisitions to keep up their growth momen- tua - hence Hanson's declared interest in IC.

She comes from Erdut, a small town in Slavonia, eastern Croa- tia - an area where Serbs, Croats and other ethnic groups live cheek by jowl and which has been the centre of recent heavy fighting. The town, which is 60 per cent Croat, 15 per cent Hungarian, and the rest Serb, was heavily bom- barded last month by Serb mil- itants and the federal army. \"My father's llbrary has been dedtroyed&My uuncle' art col- lection is W snmithereens,\" she says. \"Neither the people of Zagreb nor ti0r64 has any idea Iba at: Islike ot In Slavonia.

We now want to continue where we left off and revive our Croatian identity.\" In the air-raid shelter, women and men gathered around the radio. The news flash reported that two federal army jets were heading in from the west towards the capital. People remained surprisingly calm. \"This is a kind of phoney war,\" said Branka, a 34-year- old computer programmer. The radio then played - as it always does during air raid warnings - a sentimental song called \"Stop the war in Croa- tia\". Composed recently by Tomislav Ivcic, a Croat, it is supposed to galvanise the nation's spirits. After the air-raid warning ended, the song faded out. Zagreb's inhabitants poured out of the cellars and shelters into the sunshine. The calm which had beset the city for the past half-hour was quickly broken. Trams started screech- ing along the steel rails again. For a time at least, life started returning to \"normal\".",

   "text_content" : "Richard Tomkins takes issue with BR's TV campaign or once, British Rail has something to shout about. _ That, at least, is the message of its latest InterCity television advertising campaign. Viewers see assorted shots of high-speed trains mysteriously clad in black silk and flying national flags. Then, in the final scene, a train flying the Union Flag is unveiled to reveal one of the Inter- City 225 expresses now in service on the London to Edinburgh route. \"All over the world, new, faster trains are being unveiled,\" the voice-over intones. \"The fact is that, here in Britain, with the launch of the new Inter- City 225, we have more trains going at over 100mph than any country in Europe. Just thought you ought to know.\" Perhaps we ought: for if the claim is true, Britons are suffering an unjustified inferiority complex in thinking they have been left behind in the high-speed railway race. Certainly, the first part of the claim is indisputable. All over the world, high-speed railways are emphatically in fashion. They exist in Japan, France and Germany; they are being built in Spain and Italy; and they are at various stages of the planning process in the US, China, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Belgium, Czecho- slovakia and the Soviet Union. But in Britain? Britain has, to be sure, long been an enthusiast for speed. The 100mph barrier was broken as long ago as 1904 when Britain's Great Western Railway claimed a record- breaking 102mph for its steam loco- motive City of Truro. But it was the development of electric traction after the second world war that opened up new horizons for the I railways. The only problem was the track. All those bends mattered little when trains were chugging along sedately in the steam age. But as speeds rose, locomotive designers found themselves increasingly con- strained by the need to keep pas- t sengers in their seats and the ; trains on the rails. I First to succumb to the inevita- i ble was Japan. With its transport systems at saturation point, it decided to build a completely new, straighter railway line between Tokyo and Osaka. The line cap- tured world headlines when it opened in October 1964. Suddenly, everyone wanted 130mph \"bullet\" trains like Japan's. That Europe was the next to get them owes much to its population density. With their roads and air- ways chock-full, most European countries have been turning back to rail as a solution to their trans- port problems. But to compete with other forms of transport, the rail- way infrastructure has to move out of the steam age. Thus, France's high-speed TGV network started spreading outwards from Paris in 1981, and the first lines in Ger- many's InterCity Express network opened earlier this year. So while Japan's newer bullet trains whistle along at 160mph, Germany's ICE trains clock up 175mph, and France's TGV trains t regularly run at more than r, 185mph, what has been happening a in the UK? I The answer is: nothing much. t One has to fumble for the history r, books to find the last recorded instance of a new main line open- ing in Britain. (It was the Great t Western & Great Central Joint a Railway in April 1906.) The fastest - trains on BR, the InterCity 225 a expresses on the newly-electrified k London-Edinburgh line, run at - 140mph - barely faster than the I 126mph achieved by the steam loco- I- motive Mallard on the same line t more than half a century ago. s Does Britain, then, have any I plans to Join the high-speed club? a Yes, says the Department of - Transport. The government k announced last year that a high-speed line would connect Lon- t don with the Channel tunnel. All , that remains to be decided - and it p is a large all - is what route the s line should take, when it is going n 1. 7 4 1- It it 5 d It Â»* y it a I- 9 ae - to be built, and who will pay for it. e Even if this line is built, how- I ever, it will be subject to a 140mph y speed limit for fear of noise com- I plaints from those living near the if line. What true rail enthusiasts I Lt want is a comprehensive network I a of proper high-speed lines, starting i* with a new line hom London to the 11 north. It A few moments with Dr John Pri- a deaux, managing director of Inter. g City, are enough to temper such r 1 1 1 f c 1 I 1 c 1 1 1 1 idealism. The economic reality is somewhat different. Take the West Coast main line from London Euston to the north-west and Scotland, he says. This Is InterCity's next big project. If it can ever find the Â£750m it needs, it is due to start upgrading the line in the next few years. The present journey time from London-Manchester, the busiest section of the route, is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Replacing the worn-out trains with the planned 155mph expresses will cost Â£600m and will cut the journey time to 2hrs 20mlns. For Just Â£150m more, the time can be cut to Ihr 50mins by straightening some of the more pronounced curves and allowing the new trains to run flat out. A new, high-speed line to Man- chester would be colossally expen- sive, says Dr Prideaux: Â£3bn at a guess. Even running non-stop - thus sacrificing important revenue from intermediate stations - it would only cut the journey time to Ihr 35mins. So after spending Â£600m on trains, InterCity has the choice between spending Â£1S0m more to save 30mins or Â£2.4bn more to save 45mins. There are no prizes for guessing which is the Treasury's choice. Why is it, then, that other coun- tries are building high-speed net- works? Each has its own special reasons, says Dr Prideaux. France is a much bigger country than Britain, so potential time savings are greater. Germany needs new lines to reflect the way its economic axis has changed. Italy's existing lines are particularly bendy. Outside the south-east, it seems, Britain is cursed with main lines roughly in the right place, well laid out and capable of absorbing more, faster traffic. A high-speed network therefore remains a fantasy: not even the Labour party is promising one, and if the Conservatives win the next election, they plan to pri- vatise the railways in any case. As for the second part of BR's advertisement: well, yes, the needle on the speedometer does momen- tarily touch the 100mph mark more times a day on British trains than on continental ones. But what does this mean? Does anybody care other than card-carrying members of the ton-up club? To be fair, Britain has quite a lot of trains that often go quite quickly. But it has not had the fast- est trains since the 1930s when the Great Western Railway's Chelten- ham Flyer briefly held the title; nor is it likely to have them again.",

   "text_content" : "Rom Mr FeliU FitzRoy and Mr Ian Smith. Sir, The notion that road pri- cing provides a cost effective solution to urban congestion (\"Clocking up the miles\", Sep tember 18) is dubious. This is true even if the revenue from road charges is invested in public transport. Evidence from the Continent, systemati- cally neglected by UK planners and academics, demonstrates that scarce road space can be rationed more efficiently by quantity than by price. Policy experience in Euro- pean cities such as Zurich, Bologna, and others shows that the provision of segregated bus, tram and cycle lanes markedly increases the effi- ciency of road use. Exclusive lanes for public transport and priority right of way at inter- sections significantly shortens journey times relative to those of the private motorist. In peak periods, therefore, a high fre- quency and sufficiently dense public transit network pro- vides a powerful incentive for car users to switch travel mode, particularly when inner- city driving and parking space in substantially restricted, and cheap transferable season tick- ets encourage family use. This solution to urban congestion minimises administrative costs, renders road pricing superfluous, and has been proved in practice in differing urban environments from Italy to Scandinavia without expen- sive new electronic gadgets and surveillance systems. Felix FitzRoy and Ian Smith, department of economics, St Salvator's College, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife KY16 SAL From Mr DJMSoater. Sir, So the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames is considering charging motorists for the use of \"its\" roads (Sep- tember 18). Fine.

Sir, It is a pity your article about Tyneside (\"Surviving behind a barricade of baked beans\", September 17) appeared to give credence to the negative and Marxist views of Dr Fred Robinson. Yes, the problems on a few north-east estates are severe. You criticise the position that the 800 jobs so far created in Newcastle Business Park do not come from the next door estates; but they must come from somewhere. Eight hun- dred more jobs in the region is surely good news, not bad. New centres of prosperity being created by the Tyne and wear Development Corpora- tion and others are beacons of hope and creators of confi- dence. It is confidence as much as any other material factor that eventually restores an economy. For Robinson and others to sneer at that confi- dence as \"hype\" is totally unproductive. The problems of the northeast are being tack- led positively and with success. No one can deny that the riots are a serious matter, but they are, I believe, an aberra- tion caused by criminal ele- ments associated with ram raids and massive auto-theft. These are law and order mat- tes rather than social matters. PD Nicholon, 'Tu and Wear Developomet",

   "text_content" : "Y' RllWr Peston I.BERTY LIFE of South Africa and France'sUnion des Assur- ance de Paris, the insurance companies, are combining their shareholdings in Sun Life, in an attempt to end spec- ulation that they are not acting as friendly partners in the maniagemenit of the UK insurer. They are also buying Sun Alliance's 4.5 per cent stake in Sun Life for Â£35m, ending a 181-year-old relationship between the two British insur- ers. In a separate development to cement the relationship between UAP and Liberty, UAP is taking a 16.8 per cent stake in TransAtlantc Hold- ings, Liberty's European investment 'Whicle which is listed i Lxi boirg.n \"Three yeatrs there was war between us and Liberty\", commented Mr 4Jan'Peyrele- vade, chairman' of UAP, the state-cpntrolled French insurer. \"Two years ago we signed an armed peace. Now there is frlendahip\". Mr Peter Grant, chairman of Sun Life, welcomed the merger of the the two companies'inter- ests as providing much-need stability to the ownership of his company. Liberty and UAP both have 27.7 per cent holdings which are being injected into Rock- leigh Corporation, a shell com- pany in which they will each have 50 per cent stakes. The Sun Alliance ahires are Aso being put Into Rockeiigh, giv- ingit-atotal holding of 58.9 per cent. Neither company can with- draw from Rockleigh for at least four years.

They are committed to keeping the com- bined number o their repr sentatives to less than half the board.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomson In Tokyo and Michlyo Nakamoto In London RICOH, Japanese office automation equipment maker, is to pay Â£122.m for a 24.2 per cent stake in Gestetner Holdings, the UK office equipment company. Ricoh says this will strengthen its sales network in Europe for plain paper copiers and sac- simile machines and, particularly increase the penetration of its new technology. Ricoh will buy convertible notes from the ASP Group, the holding company that is Gestetner's leading shareholder, and, on conversion of the notes, Ricoh and ASP Group will each hold a 24.2 per cent stake. Ricoh said that the stake would mean closer co-operation with Gestetner, which has done business with the Japanese com- pany since the mid-1960s. Mr Hiroshi Saka- gami, Ricoh's general manager of interna- tional communications, said that interest in Gestetner's direct sales network prompted the purchase, which has been discussed for about a year. \"Gestetner is stronger in direct sales than in dealerships, and for new technol- ogy, such as digitilisation and and colour- isation, it is often better to use direct sales. Dealers are sometimes more com- sortable with the technology they already know.,\" Mr Sakagami said. Ricoh has manufactured office equip- ment for Gestetner, and it hopes the closer tie will increase the sales of its own brand and of equipment sold under other labels. Mr Sakagami said that \"we have a policy to strengthen the marketing of both of these areas\". Ricoh is one of the three major manufac- turers of office automation equipment in Japan but it has been slow to expand its international operations. The closer rela- tionship with Gestetner would be a step forward in correcting that imbalance. Mr Greg Melgaard, deputy chairman, said that the strategic relationship with Ricoh would give the group access to new gener- ation office automation products. Ricoh more importantly has a good track record in product innovation com- bined with a strong commitment to research and development. A close relationship with the manufac- turer will become increasingly important for distributors as the market accelerates its move away from digital to analog equipment. New \"families\" of products are being developed and a close relationship with a major supplier will be important in ensur- ing that the distributor has an alignment of products. The closer relationship will also enable Gestetner to have influence on new prod- uct development, mainly on specifications of product features and market needs. The other major benefit will be to help strengthen Gestetner's balance sheet by raising holders' funds by M90m, Also it will provide an extra Â£12m to bolster the busi- ness.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Robert Peston LONRHO AND other holders of Brent Walker's convertible bonds are considering suing Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, for allegedly compiling a misleading prospectus for the E100m bond sale last Novem- ber. It has also emerged that Brent Walker's banks yester- day gave new refinancing pro- posals to representatives of Mr Michael Smurfit and his com- pany Jefferson Smurfit - they together own 25 per cent of the bonds. Brent Walker's banks consider Mr Smurfit's support vital if the troubled leisure group is to avoid receivership. \" rwion E Legal action against Hill Samuel, Brent Walker's sinan- cial adviser, may also be taken by Mr Smurfit and his com- pany. Lonrho alleges that Hill Samuel did not undertake a comprehensive due diligence audit of the company. But Hill Samuel said it was nonsense for the bondholders to consider legal action against it since most of them had decided to invest in Brent Walker before it brought out its prospectus. Since the bondholders bought the bonds at the end of last year, Brent Walker has been on the brink of collapse, making the bonds almost worthless. The company has been working with its banks to avoid receivership by securing the agreement of creditors to a refinancing. Brent Walker's banks yester- day gave new bond-swap terms to representatives of Mr Smur- fit and his company Jefferson Smurfit. They are being asked to swap their bonds for another financial instrument. For months the bondholders and banks have been unable to reach agreement, because the bondholders have been insist- ing on being given debt in exchange for their bonds. The new offer is not straight- forward debt. But the banks are hopeful that it will satisfy the bondholders' request for a voice in any future refinancing of Brent Walker. A response from Mr Smurfit and his company is expected over the weekend. If he approves the terms, they will be sent to other bondholders. In July, a handful of Brent Walker's banks, led by Bar- clays, opposed the offer of debt to bondholders. But Midland Bank said yesterday that it gave its agreement to the debt offer. All banks have approved the new terms.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Sluggish London Retailing Pulls Liberty down 36%",
   "text_content" : "a W By Michlyo Nakamoto CONTINUED SLUGGISH trad- ing in its retail activities depressed profits at Liberty, the retailer and manufacturer of printed textiles, in the half- year to August 3. The slump in tourism that has persisted since the begin- ning of the year and weakness in UK consumer demand took pre-tax profits down 36 per cent to Â£1.65m (Â£2.6m). Mr Harry Weblin, chairman, said the marked absence of tourists from the US had a par- ticularly damaging effect on sales at the group's flagship store in Regent Street, London. However, retail activity was resilient outside London, he said. Also the fallin profits, which came on lower turnover of Â£38.lm (Â£41.3m), is compared to a record first half last year. Retailing, which was very slow in the first half, was par- ticularly hard hit, with a Â£8,000 trading profit swinging into a loss of Â£510,000. Converting and wholesaling suffered from an unfavourable trading environment in major markets including Europe. However, sales and profits from the joint venture in Japan were \"creditable\". Trading conditions in the second half remained difficult, Mr Weblin said. \"We have not seen the upturn that the Prime Minister or the Bank of England are saying is there.\" Earnings fell to 5.13p (9.27p) but the interim dividend is increased to 1.85p (1.7p).",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate which has launched a hostile take- over for Racal Electronics, yes- terday revealed that it has been approached by a number of businesses interested in buy- ing parts of Chubb. Mr Justin Dowley, director at Morgan Grenfell, advising Williams, said he had had sev- eral approaches on behalf of companies interested in buying part of Racal's UK locks busi- ness. He said: \"We have been approached by a number of intermediaries, mainly banks, on behalf of unnamed clients who are interested in purchas- ing part or all of the Chubb locks business its we succeed in our bid for Racal.\" Williams is willing to shed all of Chubb's retail business and its own Ingersoll factory, which makes retail locks, in order to avoid the bid being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Williams yesterday posted its formal offer document to Racal shareholders. Racal will have to respond to the docu- ment within 14 days. The Racal board yesterday said that the document added nothing to Williams announce- ment of September 17 and that the Racal board believed the offer lacked financial or com- mercial merit. It added that it significantly undervalued Racal's longer-term potential. The Williams all share offer was worth Â£701m last night."

Earnings per share were 26.08p (28.98p) and an unchanged second Interim of 4.25p Is being paid in lieu of the final for a same-again total of 8.375p. Mr Gabriel will continue to manage Interlink, which will operate independently from Parcellne, Mayne's existing UK parcel delivery service. Interlink operates a network of 146 franchises throughout the British Isles. Mr Ian Webber, Mayne's managing director, said the acquisition of Interlink would strengthen the group's posi- tion in the highly competitive express freight market. He added that the del was \"a log- ical extension\" of the group's strategy of expanding its core perations in the European distribution and express deliv- ery market through acquiring small but significant competi- tors. As part of this Mayne recently announced the forma- tion of a Joint venture with two established express freight businesses designed to give the group a foothold In Italy, one of the most difficult Euro- peman markets. Mayne's strategy contrasts with TNT, the rival Australian transport group, which sus- fered a sharp fall in its share price earier this year on wor- ries over its ambitious attempt to build a European network of air freight routes. TNT shares have recovered strongly on the Australian Stock Exchange in recent weeks, following the imeuncement of a Joint ven- turexpress delivery company by TNT and a group of Euro- pean post offces.",

   "text_content" : "I By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent muiumwi uujr w %mu) - euDE mougiDS, cDuirmIun inie ovenap DKtwUen tue companie TILBURY Group, the UK contractor and developer in which Philipp Holzmann the large German construction company holds a 29 per cent stake, yesterday emerged as the successful bidder for Rob- ert M Douglas. The board of Douglas, a Mid- lands-based construction com- pany, is recommending accep- tance of a share offer which values the group at Â£85.3m. Douglas family interests and other shareholders controlling 59.9 per cent of the company's shares have given irrevocable undertakings to accept the terms which include a partial cash offer. Tilbury's shares fell 25p to 658p following the announce- ment of the bid and its interim results which showed pre-tax profits down 29 per cent to Â£6.66m for the six months to June 30. The share price of Douglas fell from 520p to 508p. Shareholders are being offered 81 Tilbury shares for every 100 Douglas shares cur- rently held. They can elect to accept a cash offer worth 498p for each Douglas for up to 40 per cent of individual holdings. The merged group will be renamed Tilbury Douglas. Mr Mike Bottjer, Tilbury's chief executive, said that the offer for Douglas had been sup- ported by Holzmann and Advanta Management, a Ger- man investment group which owns a 14 per cent stake in Tilbury. Holzmann and Advanta are providing some of the under- writing for the cash offer. Fol- lowing the merger Holzmann's stake is expected to reduce to about 20 per cent. Advanta's holding will fall to about 10 per cent. Two years ago Tilbury nar- rowly escaped being taken over by Lilley, the Scotland-based construction group, after a bit- terly contested Â£137m takeover bid. Lilley subsequently sold its stake to Holzmann and Advanta at a loss. Mr Bottjer said yesterday that Tilbury's strengths were in specialist civil engineering, particularly in water and roads, while Douglas was more heavily involved in commercial and industrial building. He said: \"Tilbury is strong in southern England and mainly carries out jobs in the Elm to Â£5m range. Douglas is strong in the west Midlands and has greater experience of manag- ing large-scale building pro- jects such as the International Convention Centre in Birming- ham and Honda's first Euro- pean assembly plant at Swin- don.\" \"There is very little overlap between the two businesses. we are strong in pipework while they have developed spe- cialist skills in formwork and in building techniques for mul- ti-storey car parks.\" The combined companies in their last full financial year - they have different year ends - generated pre-tax profits of Â£31m on sales of Â£535m includ- ing associate and joint venture companies. In terms of turn- over this would make the merged group about the 15th largest UK construction group. They currently have net cash of Â£6m compared with shareholders funds of Â£97m. Tilbury yesterday declared a maintained interim dividend of 10.5p on earnings per share of 23.2p (30.9p). Its turnover for the half year declined to Â£89.7m (Â£107m).",

The US bank is replacing Salomon Brothers which was sacked by the UK Treasury for rigging US Treasury bond auc- tions. Advisers to the government yesterday stressed that the two other finalists, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, had been able to give the Treasury assurances that they had not violated US law. In a separate move the gov- ernment announced that the stockbrokers Hoare Govett, UBS Philips and Drew, Smith New Court and Kleinwort Ben- son Securities have been cho- sen as co-managers of the UK syndicate. Cazenove and Barclays de Zoete Wedde have already been appointed UK co-lead manag- ers. SG Warburg is global co-ordinator and UK regional lead manager.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt Otto Versand, the German mail order group, has sold a 7.5 per cent stake in Next, the UK fashion retailing company, in order to help finance its ambitious expansion plans in east Germany. Otto acquired the sharehold- ing as part of its successful effort to acquire the Grattan mail order business from Next earlier this year. It initially bought a 3 per cent holding, which it later increased to 9.9 per cent. Otto, which is family- owned, beat Sears of the UK for control of Grattan; the takeover price was Â£165m. The shares sold by Otto yes- terday were worth Â£11.6m. Since Otto agreed to buy Grat- tan in March, Next's shares have risen from about 30p to 45p. \"Now that Otto has bought Grattan, there was no need for it to hold on to Next shares\", said Mr Malcolm MacLachlan, retalng analyst with stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew.",

   "text_content" : "By Enrique Tessrl in Helsinki SKOPHANK, the central bank for Finland's 115 savings insti- tutlons, is to receive a FM2bn (4878m) injection of capital as part of a rescue package from the Bank of Finland. It also became clear yester- day that the Bank of Finland is drawin up plans to dispose of me Skopbank's sharebold- ings, notably its 60 per cent stake in Tampella, the ailing forest products and metals group. On Thursday the Bank of Finland took control of Skop- bank, which has been hit by economic recession and the slump in the Finnish property market. Yesterday the central bank hinted that it would prob- ably retain control of Skop- Dank for two years. According to Mr Esko Ollila, a Bank of Finland director, the central bank was presently studying the possibility of creating one or posidly two separate holding companies to facilitate Sopbaks rescue. The reaoning behind the cre- ation of a number holdin companies would be to facilf- tate Tampella's decoupling from Skopbank. A decision Is expected next week. Mr Ollila added that the severe recession in Finland and the lethargic state of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had made it virtually imosible for the Bank of Fnland to se Skopbank's large sharehold- ings directly through the stock market. For the first four months of this year Tampella turned in a pre-tax loss of FM482m, against a loss of FM4m during the same period in 1990. Tampella will publish its eight-month interim results towards the end of next month. Tampella yesterday asked the Helsinki bourse to suspend share trading. The company said that cae inits owner- ship were t e \"The detailed arrangemens are not yet completed.\" it said in a statement. However, Mr Timo Summa, Tampella's 'general manager, strongly rebuffed rumours that his company would be ripe for bankruptcy. \"We will be able to cose our books at the end of August as well as at the end of Decem- ber,\" he said. The Skopbank affair has encouraged the Finnish gov- ernment to take action to revamp present insurance deposit schemes so they would have greater reserves for emer- gency situations. The insurance deposit scheme for the savings bank group is FMIOOm. It is to be raised to FM200m.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest com- pany, yesterday blamed depressed market conditions for a 42 per cent fall in net profits to A$232m (US$182.6m) for the first quarter to the end of August. The result, around A$10m higher than market forecasts, partly reflects the impact of recession on BHP's steel divi- sion, which reported a fall of A$66m to A$49m in net operat- ing profits. However, most of the reduc- tion in profits was due to the inclusion in the earlier quarter of abnormal profits of A$114m relating to the sale of the group's holding in Woodside Petroleum. The fall in profits is reduced to 13 per cent when the impact of the Woodside sale is excluded. The result was also an improvement on the fourth quarter of last year, when the group had made net profits of A$199m. BHP said sales had been down 10 per cent to A$3.7bn, largely because of the loss of revenue from Woodside. Lower steel revenues were partially offset by the inclusion for the first time of sales from the Escondida copper mine in Chile, which had been commis- sioned in December. Escondida was the biggest factor in an increase of 35 per cent to A$177m in net operat- ing profits by the minerals division, which also increased exports of Australian coal. The division benefited from increases in iron ore prices and favourable exchange rates. Despatches by the steel divi- sion to domestic customers were down 15 per cent, but the fall in export sales was restricted to 8 per cent. BHP said the division's performance was an improvement on the previous two quarters. The petroleum division reported net earnings of A$130m, an improvement of 10 per cent after excluding the impact of last year's Woodside sale. The results include 100 per cent of the earnings of Hamil- ton Oil since July 2, when shareholders approved a merger of the company with BHP. In addition, BHP has also consolidated the contribution from Beswick, a joint venture vehicle with Foster's Brewing, formerly Elders IXL, which owns 22 per cent of BHP. The directors said the group would pay an unchanged interim dividend of 19.5 cents fully franked.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman MR JOHN REED, the chairman of Citicorp, America's biggest bank, yesterday predicted that the value of US commercial real estate will have dropped by 30 per cent from its peak in the late 1980s before the mar- ket bottoms. US commercial real estate values have already dropped by between 10 and 25 per cent - depending on geographic location and type of property - since peak levels of a few years ago. Mr Reed, speaking in Chi- cago, said he expected the real estate problem to continue to trouble the balance sheets of banks and insurance compa- nies for years to come. He said Citicorp's own level of loan write-offs and bad debt provi- sions would remain high well beyond the next two years and possibly for as long as the next five to seven years. Asked whether Citicorp's write-offs and and provisions would remain above the $lbn mark in the third quarter of this year Mr Reed said: \"We will keep on the same pace we've been operating on. You won't see any particular differ- ence in our third quarter.\" Citicorp has already written off $2.3bn of loans in the first half of 1991 and recorded bad debt provisions of $l.84bn. Mr Reed's prediction sug- gests the US banking industry has not yet seen the end of its real estate related woes. \"We don't know where the market is,\" he explained, referring to the difficulty of determining market prices in the troubled real estate sector. Mr David Schulman, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers, said he agreed with Mr Reed's forecast that real estate could remain depressed for more than five years. \"This is an extended bottom,\" he said, adding there could be real estate write-offs by the end of the year to rival the Third World debt loan losses.",

   "text_content" : "By Nikk Talt in New York SALOMON Brothers, the scandal-hit US Investment bank, said yesterday that it believed two further Instances in which it submitted unau- thorised bids during US Tres- sury auctions had come to light Salomon also admitted that this was unlikely to be the end of its misconduct disclosures. \"It seems to us likely that still other instances of similar behaviour will be uncovered In the future through our inter- nal review or by the investiga- ting authorities,\" the bank stated In a formal release. uerycR maugnam: sanen over day-to-day running The scandal started when Salomon, one of the most pow- erful traders in the govern- ment bond market, disclosed that in several recent Treasury auctions it had bought sub- stantially more than the 35 per cent of an issue which any one firm is allowed to control. In the process, it had submitted bids in the names of customers who had not authorised it to do so. The late reporting of this rule-breaking to the authori- ties led Mr John Gutlfeund, Salomon's chairman, and other senior executives to resign. The day-to-day running of Salomon was taken over by Mr Deryck Maugham. Various investigations of Salomon's behaviour and the Treasury auction market generally are now under way. Salomon said that the latest evidence of unauthorised cus- tomer bids being submitted during auctions followed receipt of \"documentation from governmental authorities that was not in the flies\". Salomon added that it had been \"asked by the US attor- ney's office for the Southern District of New York and the anti-trust division of the Department of Justice to pro- vide details of these instances of misconduct only to the investigating agencies in order to avoid jeopardising or in any way compromising the investi- gations that are under way\".",

   "article_dc_title" : "New England Banks Expected to Merge",
   "text_content" : "I By Aln Frriedmnn n New York .A MERGER between the Bank Boston and the Shawmut Natinal Bank, which would create the biggest bank in New England and the 10th largest in the US, is thought to be imminent. The merger of the two loss makers - the latest in the flurry of bank combinations that began last July with the deal between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover of New York - would create a Boston-based bank with $55bn of assets. The deal would bring together two of the banks hard- est hit by bad debts in the property market and other woes of the New England econ- omy. It was the region's severe recession that contributed to the failure last January of the Bank of New England (BNE). BNE was later acquired by Feet/Norstar. The aim of the merger would be to cut costs and seek a return to profitability by shed- ding staff, eliminating overlap. ring branches and strengthen. ng the combined banks' franchise in five New England states. The Bank of Boston, which over the past year reduced its workforce by nearly 2,000 to 16,300, suffered $188m of losses in the first six months of this year, after a $395m loss in 1990. The bank, with 254 branches in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island, has $1.75bn of problem loans. Assets tetal 323b. Shawmut, 'which has dual headquarters in Hartford, Con necticut, and Boston, has reduced its Workforce by nearly 1,000 to 11,500 over the past 12 months. Shawmut recorded $17.4m of losses in the first half of the current year, in the wake of a $133m deficit in 1990. The bank's assets are $22.7bn and its problem loans amount to $1.6bn. It has 340 branches. in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Analysts say the merged bank would probably cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs, or up to 14 per cent of its combined workforce of 27,800. One feature of the deal that federal bank regula- tors are believed to be eximin- ing Is a plan to'raise mdre than $500m of fresh capitali as a hedge against prospectv loan Fleet/Norstar's takeover of the Bank of England) eated an entity with $46bn ofassets, the largest in the region. This would be overtaken by a merger of Bank of Boston and Shawmut. Talks between the two insti- tutions are believed to have started last spring. Neither bank would comment on the merger talks, but analysts believe that it could involve a stock swap of just under one Bank of Boston share for each Shawmut share.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Southeast Reopened by New Owner",
   "text_content" : "By George Graham in new York BRANCHES of the failed Southeast Bank yesterday reopened their doors under the name of their new owner, First Union, after a speedy rescue operation by US bank supervi- sors. The Florida bank was forced to close on Thursday when the Federal Reserve cut off the central bank financing that had kept it afloat. Southeast Banking Corpora- tion, the bank's parent com- pany, also filed for liquidation yesterday under Chapter 7 of the US bankruptcy code. \"We just ran out of time,\" said Mr Douglas Ebert, South- east's chief executive. The Fed was notified by the comptroller of the currency - one of several tiers of bank supervision in the US - that Southeast was no longer viable as a privately funded institu- tion because of its poor sinan- cial condition. \"A bank can close both on a capital basis and on a liquidity basis. This bank failed on a liquidity basis,\" said Mr Wil- liam Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor- poration (FDIC), which guaran- tees depositors in the event of a bank failure and which was immediately placed in charge of Southeast. FDIC then completed arrangements for a bailout operation with First Union, which agreed to pay $212m to take over Southeast's deposits and assets, except for property. Southeast has a history of poor management decisions and suffered from its heavy concentration on commercial property loans. With non-per- forming assets reaching 10 per cent of its loan book, it reported a second quarter loss of $139m, contributing to a run on deposits, which fell by 29 per cent in the first eight months of this year. The deal should make First Union the second largest bank in Florida behind Barnett Banks, which is believed also to have bid for Southeast. First Union said yesterday that the acquisition of South- east should add $60m to its net profits in 1992, rising to between $115m and $150m in 1994-96. However, it also revealed that it would have to make a bigger than expected $140m provision on its loan book in the third quarter.",

The group said the recession and stiffer competition had driven commodity glass prices down to their lowest levels for 15 years. The outlook for the second half was marginally better, but Glaverbel said it was expecting 1991 to be worse than forecast at the beginning of the year. One ray of light for Glaver- bel is that Glavunion, the pri- vatised Czech flat glass com- pany in which it bought a majority stake this year for $61.2m, is already making a profit.",

   "text_content" : "By Haig Simonlan in Milan EDISON, the stock market- listed energy company con- trolled by Italy's Montedison group, raised net profits by 64 per cent to L67bn in the first six months of this year. Sales rose by 12 per cent to L277.7bn ($219.8m). The company said the increased profits had stemmed from both higher tariffs and a more efficient business mix. Edison was also helped by a sharp fall in net debt, which dropped to L135bn at end-June against L260bn at the end of last year. Edison made no profits fore- cast for the year as a whole. Net profits in 1990 amounted to L92.3bn. However, it said earn- ings next year would benefit from its current investment programme, notably the intro- duction of a large plant at its Porto Marghera site near Venice. * Pre-tax profits at Sasib, the diversified machinery group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding com- pany, fell to L61.lbn in the first six months of this year from L70.4bn in the 1990 half. Although sales rose by 11.2 per cent to L364.2bn, group turnover, adjusted for acquisi- tions, fell by 6.2 per cent. Sasib attributed the sales decline to the one-off boost early last year from a big order for the Soviet Union. Mean- while, earnings were affected by the recession in many mar- kets early this year and by restructuring costs at some newly acquired loss-making businesses. * The Italian Treasury is offering L8,500bn of seven-year variable-rate certificates (CCTs) and L7,000bn of five- and 10-year bonds at its end- month auction. The CCTs, dated October 1 1998, are offered at L96.60 each.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Bruce in Madrid TELEFONICA, the Spanish state-controlled telecommuni- cations monopoly, has taken a key step in its withdrawal from the telecom equipment indus- try by selling a 40 per cent stake in; Fujitsu Espaha back to the Japanese parent com- pany for around $300m. Telefonica had become dis- satisfied with its joint venture with Fujitsu, which makes data-processing equipment and other telecoms peripherals, fol- lowing the Japanese group's acquisitions of ICL in the UK and, through ICL, Nokia Data of Finland. Telefonica believed Fujitsu was shifting its concen- tration away from Spain. As' Telefonica is the biggest buyer of telecom equipment in Spain, Fujitsu had little choice but to accede to Telefonica's desire to extricate itself from the joint venture. Because the parting has been amicable, analysts expect Fujitsu Espaiia Tdlefonica to survive in the domestic market despite mak- ing a loss last year. Fujitsu Espanfa's sharehold- ers yesterday agreed to a Pta5.5bn ($51.9m) capital increase. Telefonica is finding it more difficult to walk away from its two biggest industrial invest- ments - 21.14 per cent of Alcatel Standard Electrica, its biggest switch supplier, and 10 per cent of Telettra Espanola, its main supplier of transmis- sion equipment. In approving the merger of Alcatel of France and Telettra of Italy last April, the Euro- pean Commission said this would be conditional on Tele- fonica selling to Alcatel its stakes in the domestic Alcatel and Telettra affiliates. Telefonica said it was still negotiating the sale.",

   "text_content" : "THE dollar edged gradually iugher before finishing bdow the best levl of the day as doubts penrited about the . trengthdof 1t , US's recovery out ofrecessio The US currency had begun the day firmly in Europe after Far Easter dealers -had pushed if higher on short-cov- ering before the. long holiday weekend in Tokyo and Hong Kong, Japan is closed on Mon- day for Autumnal Equinox and Hong Kong for the mid Autumn festival. SThI dollar moved as high as DM1.6950 but then struggled to break above resistance at that level Dealers said turnover was generally; low. In Europe the dollar held near to Toky's closing levels but when New York opened there was an attempt to carry on the Far Eastern advance. But once again the dollar ran into resistance, this time just below DM1.70. Holding the dollar back was a report from the Federal Reserve in Philadelphia, which provides o of the first, im, ited inodication of ec$obomic activity ,:; September. Accord ingto thP Phladelpbia Fed, or-ers ere g rowing, at a hr slower pace than in August This conllmed other recent economic indicators which have pointed to a slower pace of recovery than was ntmally believed and also revived spec- ulation that there will be fur- ther reductions in interest rates. Analysts also believe that a medium sized order to sell dol- lars for Deutschemarks in New York had helped push the dol- lar back from its highs. With turnover low, even modest orders can have an exagger- ated effect on currency rates, they said. Further evidence on the state of the economy will come next week and economists expect these reports to rein- force a picture of a sluggish recovery. On Tuesday, the con- sumer confidence index for Septembe*lr Iublised. Only a Agust durable goods fig ures are reladon Wednes- day and a declne of around 5 per cent i kexpected after the 112 per cent increase in July. Later in toeee second qua ter gross nti prodctand personalncome and expendi- ture data are released. The dollar closed lower at DM1.6870 from DM1.6890; at SFrl.4730 from SFrl.4780; at Y134.40 from Y134.45; at FFrS.7450 from FFr5.7550. The dollar's index finished unchanged at 65.1. Sterling edged higher as speculation about an early gen- eral election receded slightly after recent opinion polls put the Labour party on equal rat- ing with the ruling Conserva- tive party. Sterling closed lower at DM2.9150 from DM2.9200; at $1.7275 from $1.7285; SFr2.5450 from SFr2.5550; at Y232.00 from Y232.50; at at FFr9.9250 from FFr9.9475.

   "text_content" : "IN A market dominated by take ver speculation, Alied-Lyons jumped 43 to 647p on nover of 11m as talk that a bld, for the company was about to be announced swept through the trading rooms. The two names in the frame were, once again, Philip Morris and Anheuser Busch, both of the US. The word was that a bid would be announced at 2.30pm. When that deadline passed without an announce- ment attention shifted to 3.30pm. No bid materialised by the market close and analysts were sceptical. Mr Graham Eadie at County NatWest said: \"It is highly unlikely anyone will bid for Allied. They would be inheriting a brewing business in the process of structural change and few can afford a price tag of Â£10bn.\" Sentiment in Allied bene- sited the rest of the drinks sec- tor. Bas added 18p to 985p, while Grand Metropolitan gained 9/ to 822p. Guinness jumped 33p to 1038p, with the shares also benefiting from favourable press comment, fol- lowing Thursday's results. Share placings There was a series of big pla- cings in the stores sector. Two big crosses of shares in Next and Fine Art Developments were quickly revelead as being undertaken on behalf on Ger- mnan mail order group Otto Versand. The German group sold its 7.2 per cent holding in Next and its 4.7 per cent in Fine Art Development, the mail order company, to release funds to enable the German group expand more rapidly in east Germany. Stockbroker Robert Fleming crossed the two lines of stock, 26.7m Next and 3.7m Fine Art. The stock was apparently placed with one institution. Otto Versand acquired its stake in Next earlier this year and picked up the Fine Art stake as a result of its pur- chase of Grattan, the mail order group, from Next in March. Next eased % to 44%p while Fine Art lost 4 to 353p. Asda alert Frantic activity in Asia, the troubled supermarket group, continued yesterday, reaching a climax just before the close of trading when the stock was aggressively bid up on the inter-dealer broker (IDB) net- work. Over the week turnover in the stock topped 200m shares. The market was rife with speculation that a bid for Asda will be announced on Monday. Two leading UK market- making firms, were said to have been bidding the shares up on the IDBs, which ensure anonymity for participating firms, on behalf of different stakebuilders. At the close Asda shares were 7 higher at 70p, with turn- over reaching 58m. This fol- lows the spectacular business in the shares since Wednesday when the company issued a warning of shrinking profits and a cut in the dividend. Various potential bidders for the group were being men- tioned around the dealings rooms, with German compa- nies Aldi and Metro still being put forward. Carrefour of France and Kwik-Save, the UK group, were also mentioned. Hawker excitement Heavy demand drove shares in Hawker Siddeley forward following the long-mooted hos- tile bid from BTR. The shares gained a mighty 118p to 758p to close at a premium to the BTR share exchange offer and an even bigger one to the cash alternative. Turnover soared to 14m. The market talk was that BTR would need to increase its offer to around 800p to win control and analysts advised investors to hold out. A hostile counter bid was thought unlikely but the appearance of a white knight was mooted. Among those suggested were Siemens of Germany, GEC of the UK, Alcatel of France, Westinghouse Electric of the US and Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss group. One analyst said: \"After Thursday's poor results, defending this bid is going to be difficult. It is unlikely that Hawker Siddeley will stay independent.\" BTR slipped 13p to 410p on turnover of 13m after news with analysts saying that the company could not afford to lose this bid. Ratners, which announced heavy interim losses this week, saw heavy turnover of 17m shares after the placing of a line of 4.2m shares at 119p by a leading agency broker. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank was said to have dropped its current-year profits esti- mate from Â£70m to Â£55m and The shares lost 6 to 124p. Racal Electronics, the sub- ject of a near-Â£700m bid from Williams, eased to 561%p with turnover expanding to 14m shares. A counter to the Wil- liams move is expected to emerge with a number of UK and overseas groups said to have accumculated small stakes in Racal. Vodafone, newly installed in the Footsie and subject to bid talk made further progress, closing another 4 up at 373p on turnover of 5m. The power generators made further progress on the back of a series of broker buy circu- lars. BZW, Salomon Int, Klein- wort Benson and other securi- ties firms have all prompted buying of the stocks while a series of US investment road- shows for National Power and PowerGen are expected shortly. The latter ran up 4 to 178p and the former 3%/ to 161%p. Scottish Power, where turnover jumped to 12m, raced up 6 to 115%'p, its biggest gain since the June flotation. Scot- tish Hydro added 2% to 117p. The Electricity Package, still stimulated by the positive stance of County NatWest, advanced 33 to Â£2208. BPB remained a weak mar- ket, sliding 3 more to 187p. Sharply increased turnover of 8.4m shares consisted almost entirelyof an agency cross of 4.1m shares carried out at 183p. The cross was transacted by stockbroker Robert Fleming. Glaxo continued firm on hopes of early approval for its migraine drug Imigran. The shares gained a further 25 to 1386p. Pilkington was one of the companies to suffer from fad- ing hopes that BTR may be a potential bidder. It was further affected by poor trading news from Germany where Pilking- ton is very active. The shares fell 10 at one stage before rally- ing to close 3 off at 156p on heavy turnover of 9.3m. Gestetner rose 9 to 208p after it was announced that Ricoh was acquiring a 24 per cent stake in the company. News of a Â£4.2m acquisition disposal helped Alumasc gain a further 9 to 322p. BET lost ground as a nega- tive note from Hoare Govett landed on clients' desks. A confident statement by the chairman of CRT Group failed to move the share price from 116p. However, turnover was boosted to 6.7m after several CRT directors sold 2.2m shares to institutions. Huntingdon International tumbled 53 to 215p after the company warned that fourth quarter results would be below market expectations. Problems with retail chain Chelsea Man, now in receiver- ship, affected its principal sup- plier Vivat Holdiags which fell 14 to 47p after being 25 off ear- NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW H8g(188.

CIndog Epa EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING BID SPECULATION fuelled the Options market yesterday as traders took advantage of vol- atility in the underlying cash Index, writes Peter John. Yesterday's most heavily traded stock options - Allied-Lyons, Asda, Hawker Siddeley, BTR, Grand Metro- politan, Rolls-Royce, Sears and Pilkington - have all attracted some form of bid talk in recent days. The most popular by far was Allied-Lyons with more than 6,700 lots dealt. Traders said that call buying, as an alternative to picking up shares, accounted for about half of the turnover. There was also heavy selling of puts - UBS Phillips & Drew sold around 1500 January 550 puts to take advantage of the vola- tility in the stock. Asda saw heavy turnover in the October and January calls while BTR bid target Hawker Siddeley was boosted by a two-way pulL Some investors took profits after the sharp rise in the underlying share price while others looked towards a counter bid. In Liffe, the September Foot- sie future contract saw aggres- sive buying each time it approached fair value as deal- ers sought to unwind their positions and sell stock. At the official close, the September was 2,615 with 6,435 contracts dealt FT-A INDICES LEADERS AND LAGGARDS Percentage changes since December 31 1990 based on Thursday 19 September 1991 Textiles ................................. + 52.20 Packaging, Paper & Printing.. + 45.30 Health & Household ................ + 43.94 Business Services .................. + 43.86 Chemicals ............................ + 38.04 Telephone Networks ............... + 37.01 Engineerng-General .............. + 35.18 Merchant Banks ................... + 32.84 Electricals............................ + 31.00 Other Industrial Materials...... + 30.17 Other Groups ...... ....... + 28.44 Media ...................................... + 27.15 Consumer Group .................... + 26.05 Banks ...... ............................ + 26.05 Stores ................................... + 26.04 Electricity ............................... + 25.66 nsurance(Life) ....................... + 25.37 Industrial Group ..................... + 25.28 Investment Trusts ................... + 23.45 Motors .................................. + 23.05 Transport ............................. + 22.51 500 Share Index ................... + 22.20 Conglomerates .................... + 22.18 All Share Index .................... + 21.43 Brewers and Distillers ........... + 19.31 Food Manufacturing ............... + 19.10 Capital Goods ........................ + 18.73 Electronics ........... .... + 16.43 Financial Group ................... + 16.42 insurance(Brokers) .................+ 12.73 Metals & Metal Forming .........+ 12.55 Food Retailing ........................ + 11.96 Water ................................. + 11.95 Hotel & Leisure .................... + 11.85 Building Materials .................. + 10.82 insurance(Composite) ............ + 5.21 Gold Mines Index ................... + 4.53 Oil & Gas ........................... + 4.33 Contracting,Construction ........ + 3.51 Property ............................... + 0.17 Engineering-Aerospace .......... - 5.84 BENCHMARK GOVERNMENT BONDS ed Week monh Coupon D Prie Chnge Yi age ageo AUSTRALIA 12.000 11/01 108.6400 -0.360 10.59 10.63 10.63 BELGIUM 9.00 06/01 96.7500 +0.100 9.19 9.17 9.37 CANADA' 9.750 12/01 102.2700+0270 9.39 9.50 9.72 DENMARK 9.000 11/00 99.0400 -0.000 9.15 9.11 9.29 FRANCE BTAN 8.500 11/96 97.8600 +0.120 9.02 9.00 9.25 OAT 9.500 01/01 103.8300 +0.250 8.86 8.66 9.09 GERMANY 6.750 08/01 102.0100 0.050 8.44 8.38 6.51 ITALY 12.500 03101 99.7400 +0.330 12.94 13.04 13.43 JAPAN No 119 4.600 06/99 91.6616 +0.439 6.37 6.41 6.74 No 129 6.400 03/00 102.0400 +0.531 6.04 6.08 6.40 NETHERLANDS 8.500 03/01 96.0600 +0.040 8.80 6.77 6.85 SPAIN 11.900 07/96 101.8000 +0.280 11.35 11.45 11.85 UK GILTS 10.000 11/96 101-18 +01/32 9.60 9.61 9.90 10.000 02/01 102-29 +02/32 9.52 9.58 9.99 9.000 10/0 97-17 +01/32 9.30 9.41 9.78 US TREASURY 7.675 08/01 102-04 +10/32 7.57 7.64 7.61 8.125 06/21 102-25 +13/32 7.68 7.92 8.08 London closing, 'denotes New York morning session Yields: Local market standard Prices: US, UK In 32nds., others in decimal Technfal Dat/ATLAS Price Sources",

   "text_content" : "SPAIN AND France ended the week with a flourish yesterday, as the former enjoyed a sharp rise in active trading and the latter closed at another year's high, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID rose 1.3 per cent in heavy volume. The general index added 3.62 to 276.61, a gain on the week of 1.6 per cent, as turnover grew to Pta30bn from Ptal7.7bn. One dealer said that inves- tors were switching from cash into equities, encouraged by Thursday's remarks by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, on the liberalisation of capital movement, and on hopes of an interest rate cut. The buyers were not only for- eigners, who tend to act first in a rally, but also domestic insti- tutions, the dealer said. Telef6nica attracted the most interest, although there was competition from banks and utilities. Volume in Telef6nica remained heavy at 10.76m shares, but the price slipped from its day's high of Ptal,210 to close Pta5 up at Ptal,160, for a rise of 15.4 per cent on the week. News yesterday that Telef6nica had sold a 40 per cent stake in Fujitsu Espafia added fuel to the stock's rally, triggered by Wednesday's news of a change in dividend policy.

Porsche recovered DM21 to DM93 after a fall of DM26 on Thursday.

   "article_dc_title" : "France Seizes Continental Initiative in Third Quarter",
   "text_content" : "William Dawkins explains the bourse's strength THE PARIS bourse woke from its mid-year slum- ber early in the current quarter, and has been seeing a steady increase ever since. The main ingredients of the reviving mixture have been a renewal of interest in French equities by foreign investors, evidence of a mild economic recovery and another anti- inflationary budget, which con- firmed that Mr Pierre Berdgo- voy, the Finance Minister, plans to hold his rigorous mon- etary course in spite of rising unemployment. Mr Bdregovoy's continued tight reign on the budget defi- cit has also fuelled speculation about a possible half-point cut in interest rates. Some brokers argue that this would give the market a significant lift, although Paribas points out in its monthly economic study that rates would have to be cut by 2 to 3 points to have any significant impact on activity. Beyond that, the budget has had little direct impact on French share prices. It offers a reduction in tax on distributed corporate profits, but takes most of that away again by raising taxes on the gains on companies' financial invest- ments, the combination of these measures being angrily dismissed as a trompe l'oeil by the Patronat employers' organ- isation. Even so, the CAC 40 index has climbed fairly steadily from early July to reach a new high for the year of 1,885.49 yesterday - a 7.9 per cent gain during the quarter, and well above the rise of about 3.5 per cent for Europe as a whole. Most brokers believe the index should have no problem in breaking through the psy- chologically significant 1,900 mark in the next few weeks, although it is still a long way off the previous record of 2,129.32 achieved in April last year. Daily turnover has risen from roughly FFr2bn ($340m) per day towards the start of the month to FFr2.8bn-FFr3bn by the end of this week. For- eign institutions appear to have been encouraged to return to France on the belated realisation that Mrs Edith Cresson's arrival as Prime Min- ister did not, as they had feared, signal a change in eco- nonic policy, says Mr Piers Butler, head f sales at Enaskida Securities In Paris. Many investors felt that the Paris market was overdue for a re-rating, in anticipation of economic recovery and in the wake of the earlier strong rises recorded by the US and UK markets, adds Mr David Har- rison of DLP-James Capel in Paris. By the end of last week, the CAC 40 stood on a rating of 10.9 times prospective 1992 FT-A World Indices in local terms (rebased) 125 120 115 110 105 100 5as Jan 1991 Sep earnings, still behind the price/ earnings ratio of 12 for the UK. That said, nobody expects the French economic recovery to be strong. Most economists believe that the 1.5 per cent increase in industrial produc- tion in the second quarter and the 0.8 per cent rise in gross domestic product in the same period are not enough to guar- antee a strong revival. The budget itself is bargaining on economic growth of only 1.4 per cent this year, rising to 2.2 per cent next year. Some companies appear to be on the way to an upturn, such as Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications and engi- neering group, BSN in food and CMB in packaging, all of which pleased the market with good first half profit rises. LVMH, the bellwether for the luxury goods business, is also expecting a rise in profits for the year, in spite of a small decline in the first half. However, strongly cyclical sectors are still in the dol- drums, as shown by the steep half-yearly profit declines reported by Rh6ne-Poulenc in chetalcals, and this week 'by Pechiney, the alumalinui and -agiO producer, and Saint- Gobain, the glass and pipes groupSeveral berok el St. gthese results mirk the of the cycle and say that corate earnngs gener- y co recover byas much as 15 per cent n 192. Within the general rise in share prices, two sectors stand out. Early this month, there was strong buying of the non- vot investment certificates i by state-controlled com- papies, including Credit Lyon- nais, Elf Aquta ne, Rh6ne- Poulenec and BNP. Investors were attracted by the government's decision to extend its partial privatisa- tions, announced by Mr Ber6- govoy at the end of August and confirmed by President Fran- Cois Mitterrand a few days later. The speculation is that the government could sell vot- ing rights at a discount, but brokers dismiss this as wishful thinking because the finance ministry has said nothing on the subject. At most, the highly publi- cised debate on privatisation will have reminded investors of the liberal economic tenden- cies of the Socialist Govern- ment, reckons James Capel's Mr Harrington. Pharmaceutical companies have also shown strong gains, with Sanoft shares, for exam- ple, up 14 per cent over the month, and strong perfor- mances also evident from Synthdlabo, Rh6ne-Poulenc - before its results - Roussel- Uclaf and Institut Mdrieux. These were all responding to government reforms, which will lead to a rise in drug prices and put pressure on pharmaceutical companies to spend less on publicity and more on research. The scheme is a relief to drug companies, which have been complaining that the gov- ernment has leant too hard on them in order to curb the social security budget deficit. However, analysts point out that the benefits from increased research spending will clearly not help earnings for several years. As for the rest of the market, a slow-acting medicine seems to be at work.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Tories Try to Shift Attention from Dispute over Inner Cities",
   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent THE Tory leadership yesterday ended a hectic week of pre-elec- tion manoeuvring by trying to shift the spotlight away from Archbishop George Carey's controversial remarks on inner-city poverty and back to Labour's competence to run the economy. The debate over the Arch- bishop's view that the recent Newcastle upon Tyne riots were linked to \"social depriva- tion, poor housing and illiter- acy\" was intensified by minis- ters and church leaders in a series of statements and inter- views. Although Tory Central Office dismissed the row as a storm in a teacup, Mr John Major stepped into the dispute by insisting that not all the rioters were from deprived bac ndos. Stin focus, Mr Chris Pat. ten, the Conservative chair. man, used the launch of the party's conference agenda to claim that socialism was a \"clapped out, washed out\" dogma. Mr Patten's officials, mean- while, were issuing a broadside against the Labour party's eco nomic policy for threatening to burden business with red tape. Labour leaders appeared content to leave criticism of the government's record on inner cities to the churchmen and, instead, welcomed a return to the battle over the economy. Brushing aside the red-tape attack on its supply-side poli- cies as \"an old Tory tale\", Mr John Smith, the shadow chan- cellr, rounded on the govern- ment for both squandering North Sea oil revenues and failing to stimulate manufac- turing investment. \"What we want is macroeco- nomic stability and strong sup- ply side support for industry from the government,\" he said, a\"ding that speculation over the elecuon date was deepen- ing businesses' problems by creating a climate of uncer- tainty. Mr Smith's renewed call for an early poll brought a week of frenetic electioneering and political shifts full circle. Yesterday there were eight political photocalls to add to numerous others in a week that included more than a dozen press conferences, a Tory party political broadcast and the two main parties launching nationwide poster The fevered atmosphere began last weekend after opin- ion polls showed the Conserva- tives surging four 4nd five points ahead of Labour. It was swiftly followed by an upbeat shadow cabinet strategy meeting where Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, laughed off a wave of personal attacks on his leader- ship with a challenge to the prime minister to \"cut and run. Attention is now focused on an opinion poll due to appear in the Sunday Times tomor- row. Politics, Page 4 Editorial comment, Page 6",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger and Guy do Jonqul6res MR DAVID SMITH, who in 1989 led Isosceles in the Â£2.1bn hostile battle for Gateway supermarket chain, Britain's biggest leveraged buy-out, yes- terday resigned as chief execu- tive of the vehicle with which he engineered the takeover. Ms Elizabeth Hignell, Isosce- les' company secretary and finance director, has also left the company. It is believed that Mr Smith and Ms Hignell left the heavily indebted private company with pay-offs of about Â£780,000 and Â£520,000 respectively. These arise from three-year employ- ment contracts agreed last December. The departures come after months of strained relations with the company's main shareholder, the US mergers and acquisitions specialist, Wasserstein Perella. Mr Smith will be succeeded by Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, currently a non-executive director and former chief exec- utive of Nabisco in the UK. Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of Gateway Foodmarkets, Isosce- les' main trading subsidiary, will take Ms Hignell's place. The news led to further falls in the share prices of food retailers. Last week Asda, another debt-laden supermar- ket group which has been with- out a chief executive since June, issued a profits warning, while other groups have reported slower sales growth. Mr Ernest Sharp, Isosceles chairman, said the two execu- tives had left by mutual agree- ment. \"Isosceles is moving from a financial engineering phase into its operational phase,\" he said. Relations between the two directors and Isosceles' 40 per cent shareholder, Wasserstein Perella, are believed to have become strained. Mr Smith and Ms Hignell were thought to be pressing for capital investment which Wasserstein was not prepared to back. fr Mr Smith's lack of retail of experience - he was formerly e- a partner at accountants y, Arthur Young - was also understood to concern many of Is the group's shareholders, id which include A&P, the US a, supermarket chain. r- Mr Smith and Ms Hignell b- were unavailable yesterday :e and Wasserstein Perella re London stocks................Page 13 a- declined to comment. Isosceles e- accounts for about a third of Lg Wasserstein Perella's invest- g1 ment portfolio. al Mr Smith, who advised Bud- gens on its abortive bid for ro Gateway in 1988, put together ar the Isosceles consortium specif- n ically to acquire the supermar- re ket chain the following year. Id The battle lasted three months, e with both Wasserstein Perella it and A&P backing a rival con- At sortium, Newgateway. Their stakes are a direct result of that battle, although A&P's holding fell from 20 per cent to less than 8 per cent after a refinancing of Isosceles earlier this year. Isosceles is still burdened with the Â£1.2bn debt!from the takeover. Plans to sell the loss- making US sports goods sub- sidiary, Herman's, and several stores, to repay the debt, have been scuppered by recession,' while Gateway has struggled to survive in a fiercely compet- itive market against larger groups. In the year to April 27, Isos- celes made pre-tax profits of Â£3.6m, after losses of Â£33.2m the previous year. However, after financing costs and wri- te-offs, the retained loss was Â£21.2m, compafed with alftclit of Â£38.5m. Earlier this year G& y sold 42 stores to Kwik-Save, but has found it increasingly hard to match the expansion plans of its main rivals, Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Brittan Seeks Block on De Havilland Merger",
   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels and Bernard Simon in Toronto SIR Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, is proposing to block a French- Italian takeover of de Havil- land, the Canadian aircraft maker. The move would be Brussels' first outright rejection of a merger since it gained wide anti-trust powers a year ago. Sir Leon, who argues that allowing Adrospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy take control of de Havilland would give them a near-monopoly of the EC market for small com- muter aircraft, must first win the backing of a majority of his 16 fellow commissioners. Aerospatiale and Alenia and de Havilland rank first and sec- ond, respectively, in the EC commuter aircraft market. Many of the commissioners are expected to oppose any rejection of a merger, which they argue will prevent a Euro- pean group establishing a bridgehead in North America. The proposal to block the takeover was last night circu- lated to an advisory committee of the EC. Sir Leon is not bound to heed this body's advice and the real battle will be within the EC executive, which must rule by October 14. Sir Leon declined to com- ment in Toronto yesterday on recommendations made to the advisory committee. However, he said that Mr Bob Rae, the Ontario premier, had expressed hopes earlier in the day that the EC would allow the bid to proceed. Sir Leon also dis- cussed de Havilland with fed- eral ministers in Ottawa. The scrutiny of the bid fol- lowed objections from rival EC companies - chiefly British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands. Much of the wrangle turns on the nature of the market. Sir Leon's staff argue the market is Europe, and the product range is the 40-70 seat commuter aircraft. Adrospatiale and Alenia con- tend that a broader view encompasses aircraft of greater capacity, and that the acquisi- tion of de Havilland would not give them a dominant position. Some commissioners, proba- bly including Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, will argue that Brussels should not shackle EC companies in such a world competitive market.",

   "text_content" : "By Tony Walker In Cairo and Hugh Carnmegy in Jerusalem SJAMES Baker, US sei- ary of state, flew home yes- terday after his seventh Mid- dle Bat mission since the Gulf war, hopeful but by no means certain that Arabs and Israelis will attend next month's pro- posed peace conference. He will have been encour- aged by an opinion poll show- ing that more than half of Isrel's voters would support a frhese on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories in return for US financial aid for Soviet Jewish immigration. The poll found that 57 per cent of Israelis favoured com- plying if Washington insisted on making US guarantees for $1Obn (â¬5.90bn) in loans condi- tional on a freeze. Israel's government, how- ever, continues to defy its Arab enemies and its western allies by building settlements. It emerged yesterday that hundreds of Ethiopian Jews are to be housed in the Arab eastern half of Jerusalem, and a Jewish settlement straddling the border between Israel and the occupied West Bank is also due to be founded this month. A Palestinian leader said she had made progress in hast- ily arranged talks with Mr Baker in>,Amman yesterday. about proposals for Palestin- ian participation in the Middle East peace conference. However, Mrs Hanan Ash- rawi, a university professor in the West Bank, added that more work was needed before the US formula would be acceptalMato Palestinians. The Palestine Liberation Organlaton, which sanc- tioned the meeting, is seeking explicit US endorsement of its demands for self-determina- tion, a halt to Jewish settle- ments in the occupied territo- ries and an affirmation that the Israeli annexation of east Jerusalem be addressed at the proposed conference. Mrs Ashrawl delivered a let- ter from Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, to Mr Baker containing these demands. Mrs Ashrawi's presence in Amman was seen as an indica- tion that the PLO may be will- ing to sanction the participa- tion of Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied territories in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Mr Baker has been urging this formula as a way around Israeli objections to direct dealings with the PLO. LILWi Al MUIU _ _UI Ah1 Alter tue mutns a rss- rawi said: \"There was some progress but not sufficient.\" She said the talks had been at Mr Arafat's behest and this was \"further proof of the PLO's serious intent to push the peace process forward\". At his Tunis headquarters, Mr Arafat and his advisers have been involved in intense discussions on Mr Baker's pro- posals for Palestinian atten- dance at the conference. The PLO fears that by allow- ing the meeting without its direct participation it will be underminang its position and weakening Palestintinia demands for self determinal tion. The PLO leadership is under pressure to resolve these Issues in time for a meet- ing of the Palestine National Counamcil in Algiers next week. Picture, Page 3",

   "article_dc_title" : "BTR Picks Its Victim",
   "text_content" : "Given the public way in which BTR has been searching for a bid target, it would have been reasonable to expect its share price to take off whin It fitally settled on Hawker Siddeley., The fact that its shares actu- ~klly oil\"*kent iug testahe arles 'is having trouble fol-' lowing the logic of BTR's choice. There is also a natural fear that BTR might end up overpaying. Since it can ill afford to fail, it is natural for Hawker investors to hold out for more. The question is how far BTR will be able to go without risk- ing considerable dilution in its own earnings. Yeiterday's bid price already looks on the high side for a recession-bound com- pany with a poor earnings out- look. To prevent its own earn- ings being diluted, BTR would have to find a way of squeezing at least Â£40m of extra pre-tax profit out of Hawker next year, and possibly quite a lot more. Admittedly, BTR has given itself considerable latitude in accounting terms following its recent decision to include prof- its on disposals above the line. The bid also involves a hefty dose of goodwill, given Hawker's net asset value of 390p per share against a paper offer of 727p at yesterday's closing prices. Although that ,would contribute to gearing on .BTR's part of over 70 per cent, it would also leave more scope for profits on disposals from the Hawker stable. On top come all the normal acquisi- tion accounting benefits such as restructuring provisions and the non-consolidation of loss- making operations on the basis that they are scheduled to be discontinued. This should go a long way towards preventing the acqui- sition being dilutive at the cur- rent price. The danger would come from BTR having to increase its offer significantly. Its argument that there is mile- age for margin improvement through capital spending to reduce costs is not wholly con- vincing. There is no evidence that Hawker's current manage- ment has starved its operating units of capital investment, and the company is, though belatedly, in the middle of a restructuring programme which has been confounded by the recession. The background of exceptionally poor markets would remain whoever owned the company. Arguably, BTR would have to be more aggres- sive in closing down loss- making plants than Hawker has been, or than BTR itself is prepared to admit is necessary. In every other respect, Hawker looks stuck with a dis- FT-E Index: 2,00.3 (+11.6) S price rela Wto the FT~A AlrShare Index Sso tasam 100 1970 75 80 85 90 tinctly lame defence. The bid' was timed to take advantage of an interim statement in which Hawker was candid about the grimness of its own trading prospects. It can hardly sud- denly discover that it has a rosy future. The best hope must be the arrival of a second bidder who would at least force BTR to increase its offer. There is no sign of that yet. In any case, the chief beneficiaries of an auction would be Hawker shareholders, who have al- ready been offered an exit at a price higher than they deserve. Markets It might seem a damning in- dication of the UK market's state of mind that in a week which saw bids worth bver Â£2.5bn, the FT-SE ended up 25 points lower than it started. There are extenuating circum- stances. Of the Â£2.5bn, less than Â£lbn represents a cash injection into the market, the rest being paper. And though bid fever is plainly in the air, as witnessed by the 7 per cent jump in the Allied-Lyons share price yesterday, each of the week's three bids was in some sense a special case. Hanson's bid for Beazer was designed to pre-etnpt an imminent demer- ger and Williams' bid for Racal Electronics to exploit a demer- ger which had just happened. BTR's bid for Hawker Siddeley, while contemplated for some months, was timed to take advantage of Hawker's gloomy interim statement. It is nevertheless undeniable that the bid phase of the eco- nomic cycle has been reached. It might seem perverse that it should come when the market is at new heights, but that is the nature of the game. Fund managers can move in at an early stage of the recovery because they are diversifying their risks across equities as a class. Industrialists, some of whom are quite unsure where their own businesses are going, let alone those. that might be bid targets, need clearer evi- dence of the upturn before they can undertake the much greater risk of putting all their money into a single stock. So far, the action is at the gamier end of the market, with the conglomerates 'dohig the run- ning. The more conventional kin of bidder cannot be far behind. Sun Life It would be wrong to say that Union des Assurances de Paris and Liberty Life have taken control of Sun LWfe; if only they could have agreed, they already had it. Yester- day's deal appears simply to formalilse the ever cosier rela- tionship between the two larg- est shareholders in the plucky life assurance company, although Liberty is doubtless grateful for the Â£122nm cash UAP is paying into its Transat- lantic investment vehicle; Transatlantic is fresh from underwriting Capital & Coun- ties' rights issue. By buying the Sun Alliance stake and offering to buy the remaining minority 'shares, UAP and Liberty will at least tidy up one of the sector's mes- sier ownership structures. Thanks in part to Sun Alli- ance's desire to sell,. they are able to offer to do o6 on the cheap. Arguably, 0e. 911.60 price undervalues t assurer's dividend growth poscts, which are on the i ,aver- age. Based on other ce yardsticks such MaOh ed and appraisal valu ffer is also pitched welll the fundamental valuE6s the shares. If nothing el all highlights the dangersf bing a minority shareholder. Isosceles First Asda, now Gateway. The departure of Mr David Smith from Isosceles,- the vehicle for the Gateway buy-out, creates the bizarre sit- uation in which two of the UK's biggest grocery chains have lost their chief execu- tives. The upheaval immedi- ately calls in question the notion that Gateway is eking out a better living than Asda by avoiding direct competition with Tesco and Sainsbury. It must also ring alarm bells for investors in Wasserstein Per- ella, whose investment in Gate- way is by far its largest single commitment. The prospect of a Gateway flotation looks more remote by the day.",

   "text_content" : "~ house seems ofter- to be not so much his castle as his goldmine. It is also his principal conversation piece. The ups and downs of house prices, the difficulty or ease of selling and buying, these are constant concerns. One reason for the attention is the importance of the housing market: at the end of 1989, 15.1m owner-occupiers in Great Britain experienced the joys and the traumas of a home of their own, while 67 per cent of housing was in owner occupation. Allowing for mortgage debt, net personal wealth in housing was Â£840bn, almost 40 per cent of total personal wealth. The government may have failed in its attempts to make the UK a \"share owning\" society; the opposite is the case for home ownership. The housing market is more than important. It is a source of joy and of anguish. Thrice in the last 20 years did increases in the prices of houses make people richer on paper than they had dreamed; thrice did the eager first-time buyer rush to the market only to suffer the immediate agony of gazumping and the longer term suffering of declining real wealth; thrice did the housing market crash. Over the long term, however, housing has been a \"nice little earner\". The trend increase in the real price of houses in the 1970s and 1980s was 2.2 per cent a year. Over the same period average real earnings rose at a trend rate of 1.7 per cent. The difference is not large. House prices have not increased much faster than average earnings over the decades, though they have from year to year. That this relationship exists does not demonstrate that demand determines house prices in the long run. With new private housing being constructed at a normal rate of around 150,000 a year, prices are also heavily influenced by the costs of additional supply. Those costs are themselves largely determined by the prices of land and of labour. Since land is scarce and its availability for building is tightly limited by planning controls, the long term tendency for the price of land to rise offsets what have been limited increases in productivity in housing construction. Real earnings are important as an index of cost, therefore, not just as a source of demand. On the demand side, the tendency for house prices to rise in relation to earnings can be explained by the greater participation of women in the labour force since the beginning of the 1970s, which has boosted average household earnings. Another explanation has been the growing number of house purchases by multiple borrowers, especially in the south. Subsidies to owner-occupation via mortgage interest relief and, more importantly, the absence of taxation of the imputed rental income in owner-occupation raise the demand for that form of tenure and probably for housing in general. A property-based tax, like the old rates and the new council tax, lowers demand for housing. But too much attention is paid to the existence of these subsidies and taxes. What matters for the movement of house prices is their changes. Capitalised at current long term interest rates, the Â£8bn dispensed by the Treasury on mortgage interest relief might Martin Wolf analyses the economic background be worth Â£80bn in higher house prices. This is less than 10 per cent of the value of the residential housing stock. More importantly, the significance of this subsidy at the margin is dwindling as tax rates fall, the Â£30,000 ceiling declines steadily in real value and, after the last budget, as relief against higher rates of tax is withdrawn. This particular tax relief may have raised house prices, but recently it has lowered house price inflation, just as the abolition of domestic rates raised it. In addition to the rise in the real price of housing over time, the past two decades have witnessed three huge cycles. Their pattern is clear. at the trough of the cycle, usually coincident with a recession, transactions are few and a large backlog of unsold and, at present, of repossessed houses overhangs the markets. But interest rates fall in a recession, as do house prices in relation to household earnings, whether because of earnings inflation, house price deflation or, as is true at the moment, of both. As the cost of housing falls, first-time buyers enter the market. At first, it becomes more active rather than more expensive, as desperate vendors try to dispose of the houses they have wanted to sell for years. As the market strengthens, more people try to buy and prices start to rise. Often many years after the trough of the cycle, house prices start to bubblb. Finally, the economy overheats, the monetary brakes go on and, in due course, the market collapses. In a market that can go from bankruptcy to bubble and back in a few years, timing matters. People who bought their houses in the third quarter of 1973 and sold them in early 1991 would, on average, find their overall real gain was a negligible 2% per cent. But if they bought in early 1970 and sold in mid-1989 the real gain would have been a highly satisfactory 109 per cent. If one has the luxury of timing, the rule to follow is to sell when the number of transactions is peaking and buy (at a discount) when the number of transactions has crashed. Transactions increase not merely when prices rise, but because they are rising. Fearful of losing out on that bargain of a lifetime and aware of the gains enjoyed by their peers, first-time buyers rush in at the top of the market, allowing established home owners to buy their dream houses. When prices fall, however, buyers decide to wait and sellers hang on for the prices of yesterday. Although often blamed, credit liberalisation can hardly be the culprit for the latest cycle since its shape was quite similar to those of the 1970s. Where this cycle has been unusual is not in its origin but in its ddnouement. For the first time, the solution to the travails of the housing market has not been inflation. Real interest rates have remained high and the decline in the real price of housing has been brought about by falling nominal prices, as much as by inflation. But falling nominal prices have, again for the first time, given many recent purchasers negative net worth in their houses. The question for today and still more for tomorrow is whether the shock of living in a world in which lending has proved more profitable than borrowing has changed the British housing market forever. With sterling's entry into the low inflation world of the exchange rate mechanism as well, houses may become nice little earners again, but the days of the boom and bust cycle should be gone forever. I F ONLY there had been a proper house price crash in 1988 we would now be in a much health- ier market. As it is, three years after prices peaked in the south of the country, Britain's residential property market has yet to regain its balance. The financial foundations of Thatcherism's property-owning democ- racy are still suffering from subsidence. During the spring it looked as though property prices were starting a modest recovery. The building societies were talking with guarded optimism about what might happen if mortgage rates were to come down. Well, the average cost of borrowing dipped from 14.3 per cent at the start of the year to 12 per cent by July, but both Halifax and Nationwide building societies reported that house prices fell in August. How- ever, this month mortgage rates have fallen again, to about 11.5 per cent. In a crash, financial assets typically tumble in price by a third or more. It happens when a speculative boom, usu- ally based on credit, abruptly runs out of steam. The stock market collapsed in 1987, rather than 1988, because the tim- ing was dictated by events in the US; equities forming a global market. The UK residential property market is entirely domestic, however, and its bull market did not peak until the summer of 1988, influenced by factors such as the 5 per cent economic growth, and the rush to beat the deadline for multiple interest tax relief on a single property. Moreover, there are strong regional differences in the housing market. Although London and the south east were badly hit, taking closely-linked areas such as East Anglia and the south coast retirement counties with them, prices in Scotland continued to climb strongly until early this year. Property prices in the UK do not col- lapee quickly, even in the worst circum- stances; or perhaps more accurately, home owners will not recognise a price collapse even when it has happened. This is because there is no market mak- ing mechanism as there is in shares. Moreover, people cannot simply rent inastead buying, because the rental sector is tiny and unattractive. So there is always a nibble of firt-time buyers at the cheap end of the market. For more expensive houses it is dif- ferent, and the market can simply eee. Transactions aross the market ll by more than 40 per cent between 1988 and 190, a crisis experienced dis- roportionately at the pricier end. Ther a no reab statistics here, but anecdotal evidence abounds of price drops of 2 per cent o more ina nier London streets. In Duiwich the Thatch- er thenmelm have cut 89M00 off the almi e for their redundant ne- Georan Bartt hoame, but are still demanding nearly S per cent more than the 0 they paid In 1 In this sector, bu n ed usellrs still ave to coe tos ur amin wa talk the --^fhU~lT--*.- so? the best are ot value n ous- i itrh toam i the rI a price to BecsM m mBe Wovml bas their the income of the applicant, this is a key measure of affordability. A ratio between 3.0 and 35-can be regarded as normal over the long run. When the ratio climbs above 4, as it did in the early 1970s and again in the late 1980s, the warning lights begin to flash red. In the late 1980s, when lenders responded to increased competition by relaxing their lending criteria, it was commonly argued that the ratio would shift permanently higher. Second incomes in a household were more lib- erally taken into account, and loans of 95 per cent of valuation (sometimes 100 per cent) were advanced, backed by mortgage indemnity insurance. But these lending policies have often proved disastrous. Big insurance com- panies such as Eagle Star and Sun Alli- ance are writing off hundreds of mil- lions of pounds against claims from banks and building societies in respect of loans that have gone bad. Reposses- sions have soared to unprecedented lev- els. Cautious lending is the rule again. It is logical, therefore, to expect the nrieaoanmina rafin fn dlin honIr In hia- pncetwermnug rauo lo uup oucx o ms- nur, uns waruu numewuat vaguely UMa Optimistic forecasts from mortgage lenders and housebuilders should be treated with the greatest scepticism, says Barry Riley * Wimers mid ea 6I o property sterso Page VIH How hemulg pears h hege Pgas VIMN Tha oibL oet of O seMd homes marke Pegs VIN N MWe hbereamedl prupeeGm Page IX --W i r wov emme mm i M I ovine torical levels. The ratio has fallen from its peak, but it is still probably about 4. And the problem is that there is little chance that surging earnings can bring early relief. In the past, rapid inflation has brought the ratio down quickly at times Scrisis for the housing market, but the UK is now locked into the European exchange rate mechanism. With the economy deep in recession (it has con- trcted by 2 per cent or more over the past twelve months) and unemploy- ment still climbing rapidly it is unlikely that average earnings will increase by more than about 6 per cent over the next year. If the house price to earnings ratio is to come down below 3.5 at al uickly theimre wl have to be a further downward ajuastment in property val- ues. Alternatively, stagnation will per- t for several more years. Time is also a big question mark over the availability of credit in the future.

But the average existing loan is much smaller, about Â£19,000. There is a iap of typically some Â£26,000 per dwell- ing to be financed each time a property changes'hands. To keep the market ticking over at its present depressed level of just over Im mortgage-financed deals a year requires net new money of near Â£2.5bn a month. But to finance the higher activity - say, 1.5m transactions a year - that are associated with rising prices would require more like Â£3.5bn a month, climbing quite fast as values rose. Could this money be made available within the framework of the ERM? It seems doubtful. It is possible that a greater proportion of mortgage funding could be obtained *outside the banking system, for instance through the bond market. However, it is hard to see where the money could come from to finance another house price boom. Even if it could be raised, alarm bells would ring at the Bank of England. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the gover- nor, has warned somewhat vaguely that the authorities would have to step in to head off any future surge in prices. According to a Bank of England paper published last April, interest rates would be swiftly raised. If that were not possible, there would have to be \"an examination of other measures\". Existing owner occupiers who tried to extract cash by takng out a bigger than necessary mortgage on their next home would become the primary target of any new credit controls. How this could work is anybody's guess. In any case, a le part of the equity withdrawal poe arises tan trading down by the elderly and, eventualy, from ieri- tance and sale of deceased parents' homes by their children. So although cunning credit controls might serve to stretch a limited amount of mortgage money a bit further, and thus help to I sustan house pdre they do not seem to be a ome sive answer. 1 The iR problem at the moment is i that the host ladr ha some bro- ken ruts.

Too many have also seen their equity eroded by low start mortgages and other devices which have served to add to their debt. Decades of inflation have created the assumption that the home buyer can never borrow too much. His mortgage has come to seem almost an asset rather than a liability. But many peo- ple, especially the young, have now been caught in a cruel trap. Financial wisdom has to change. The consequences of positive real interest rates are slowly beginning to sink in. Overborrowed home owners are not helped by the passage of time, instead debt piles up on the basis of compound interest. Still, there has been some improvement in recent months. Whereas the average buyer in February 1990 was paying out a peak of 44 per cent of his earnings to service the new mortgage, 18 months later the propor- tion has eased to about 32 per cent. But it will have to fall to below 25 per cent, where it hovered in the mid-1980s, before this \"affordability\" factor becomes favourable, and even then peo- ple may take a considerable time to recover their confidence. Political factors are intriguing. Traditionally all governments, especially Conservative governments, have displayed overwhelming commitment to home ownership. But at 68 per cent of the housing stock, against 55 per cent in 1979, owner occupation may not have much further to go. The abandonment of higher rate interest relief last March was a symbol of how the departure of Thatcher had changed the climate. More attention is now being paid to encouraging the growth of the rented housing stock. Once, rising house prices were seen - almost without qualification - as a good thing. But the inflation of the late 1980s gave the politicians and the Treasury mandarins a nasty shock. If sterling is locked in position against Continental currencies, high UK housing costs will damage competitiveness.

   "text_content" : "F ANYON E was in any doubt that the era of the big City takeover had returned, yesterday's Â£1.5bn bid by BTR for engineer- ing group Hawker Siddeley should have set them straight. Within a week, three British conglomerates have put more than Â£2.5bn on the table in cash and shares, triggering a new season of corporate asset reshuffling. At first glance the resur- gence of bid activity might seem unequivocally good news for the market. Yet the first two bids of the week - Han- son's Â£341m recommended takeover of Beazer, the builder, and Williams' hostile Â£701m bid for Racal Electronics - left the FT-SE 100 Index unmoved. The market rose yesterday and on Thursday, but not enough to offset earlier declines in spite of the bids. Even BTR's offer, which flashed up. on City dealing screens early yesterday morn- ing, only briefly perked up the market. By the close yesterday the FT-SE 100 had strength- ened slightly, gaining 11.6 on the day, but was 25.5 points lower at 2,600.3 on the week. One explanation for this rel- ative lack of enthusiasm is that the offers contain a large ele- ment of shares, limiting the amount of new money coming to the market. But the market has been \"soggy\" for several weeks for more fundamental reasons. The first relates to recent trading in the futures market where investors and arbitra- geurs take a view on the future value of the FT-SE 100 Index. The wave of optimism that swept the stock market after the failure of the Soviet coup last month caught some inves- tors on the wrong foot. Anx- ious to get into the PF-SE 100 index, a number of institutionm hedged an unusually large amount of their' share pur- chases in the futures market. A number of bearish devel opments such as British Aero- space's Â£432m rights issue, dampened the optimism and the market rise ran out of steam. As a result traders are unwinding their positions by buying back futures contracts and selling shares, said Bob Semple, equity strategist at County NatWest. The market also had to con- tend with poor retail sales fig- ures. With consumer spending likely to lead the economy into recovery, the fall in retail sales in August after two strong months cast a pall over the market that was not offset by the small improvement in July's manufacturing output. On top of this, analysts said a mystery seller, possibly from Abu Dhabi or Kuwait, appeared to be Imaking consist. ent and heavy disposals, when- ever the market firmed the unknown vendor stifled the rise. The first fillip to the market should have come when Han- son struck at Beazer. With hindsight, Hanson was always a likely bidder once Beazer's banks had forced it to float off its UK house building arm. But the market has been so dis- tracted by speculation about what Hanson will do with its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI that it took its eye off the smaller fry. ICI closed 28p down over the week at 1276p. Then Williams launched its hostile bid for Racal Electron- ics. It was the first day after the company had demerged its star performer, Vodafone, the operator of the cellular tele- phone market. Vodafone closed Share pices relativelo the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index 1.400 1200 1.000 800 600 400 200 100 Soums: austemm 41p higher at 373p, but the demerger made the rump of Racal vulnerable to a bid. Williams share price fell 24%p on the week, closing at 336%p, as the market antici- pated it might have to sweeten its all share offer with some cash if it is to succeed. But little was moving the market in spite of exception- ally heavy trading volume. Retail share sales - those deals not done between market makers - exceeded Â£lbn on at least two days and on Wednes- day was in excess of Â£1.5bn. Neither was the market impressed by the governor of the Bank of England's up-beat comments. It is already ner- vous about a November gen- eral election which it views as a risky strategy for the Conser. vative Party. A continuing stream of poor corporate results chipped fur. ther confidence from the mar- ket. Not only were results gen- erally as bleak as expected, Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams', which Is In hostile pursult of Racal most companies have been less up-beat about prospects than investors had hoped. Ratners, the Jewellers, gave the week's first gloomy news announcing a Â£17.7m half year loss after a Â£9m profit last year. The chairman, Gerald Ratner, was pessimistic about future consumer spending. RMC, the world's largest ready mixed concrete maker, ended the week with a 36 per cent fall to Â£68.9m in interim profits, warning that a recov- ery was unlikely next year. On the other hand, Guin- ness, the drinks and brewing group - like Glaxo last week - demonstrated yet again that its cocktail of businesses are remarkably recession proof. Guinness pre-tax interim prof- its rose 9 per cent to Â£350m, in spite of facing one of its hard- est ever half years. Another of the week's casu- alties was the received wisdom that food retailers are reces- sion proof. On Wednesday Asda, the laggard of the sector, suffered a 29 per cent share price fall after Sir Godfrey Mes- servy, the chairman, warned Hnmon: making a E351m recommended takeover of Beaor profits would deteriorate sig- nificantly this year. Even though Tesco had reported profits up 22 per cent at Â£229m on Tuesday, all the retailers suffered from Asda'a gloomy view that retail food sales were falling. Amid this general pessimism a few optimists could still be discerned, notably analysts at County NatWest MoodMac. Contrary to the prevailing view put forward by Nomura securities that the market has nowhere further to go this year, County stood out again waving the banner of sustain- able recovery. With inflation rates heading below 4 per cent, the relation- ship between the bond market - which has been strong recently - and equities must adjust by raising the price earnings multiples on which companies can be traded. The result is that the market is only temporarily over-priced, according to County. That is the theory at least. No doubt the market will decide. Richard Gourlay",

Prices have risen since the beginning of July due to the steady fall in inflation, lower interest rates and, more recently, the government's lead in the opinion polls.

Economists point out that this could be the last cut for some time, which might put a halt to the current gilt market rally. However, if Germany raises interest rates again, the Bank of England may not be able to make the cut without risking a weakening in the pound.

The shares fell by 29 per cent on Wednesday, following a profits and dividends warning which scotched thoughts that food retailers might be less vulnerable to recession than other sectors. Sir Godfrey Messervy, the chairman, said he foresaw a \"very significant deterioration in our results for 1991-02\". It fell 27p to 67p on Thursday, and market sentiment was that only vague bid rumours stopped it from falling further. These rumours persisted, and the shares closed on Friday at 70p.

   "text_content" : "market surged in the first few months of 1991, many on Wall Street thought that most of the year's good news had arrived. As proof of their conviction, companies rushed to raise new equity, and leveraged buyout mer- chants restructured debt-laden enterprises. As the year's final quarter gets underway and the sum- mer torpor recedes, that view looks astute. With the econ- omy still mired somewhere between recession and recov- ery, the Dow Jones Industrial Index shows little sign of going anywhere. Perhaps the best that can be said is that a floor seems to have developed around 200000. The Dow started out Monday still bruised by the previous Friday's Interest rate cut. But by aid-afternoon, with bond yields bllin., purchasers were back in the market. In general, their targets lay in main- stream industrial stocks. The Dow climbed almost 30 points to 3015.2, but drifted for the next four trading sessions. Doubts still remain about the strength of the recovery. Last week, for example, August's industrial production figures showed a rise of 0.3 per cent and the figures for June and July were revised upwards slightly. Housing starts rose 0.6 per cent in August, the fifth consecutive monthly gain but building permits fell by 4.9 per cent. But, then again, consumer spending remains so weak that it is possible to argue that these signs of improvement owe more to a rebuilding of stocks than any realprogress. This point was made in the \"beige book\", the Federal Reserve's summary of eco- nomic activity released on Wednesday. It stressed that economle recovery remains umeves, with the manuactur- Dow Jones Industrial Average 3100 3050 3000 2950 2900 950 July Agust September itg sector eadi4g the way, but \"Wtth little sign of a sizble rebound I consumer spendin that will contribute to a rt hgcnil~al( busnesn recov- So Wall Street awaits the forthcomIna corporate report- ing season with a ood deal of trepidation. Already, the trickle of early results and early warnings has been less than encouraging. For exam- ple, US Steel, the largest steel manufacturer in the US, warned on Tuesday that it would lose money in the third quarter period, although it was significantly more opti- mistic about the final three months of the year - reinforc- Ing views that the steel Indus- try cycle has passed its lowest point. Still on the industrial front, Cincinnati Milacron, one of the largest machine tool mak- ers announced late on Thurs- day that it was halving its quarterly dividend and would be taking a substantial third quarter charge to cover asset rite-downs and further reor- ganisation of its business. By Friday moraing, its shares had allen $1% to $10%. Meanwhile, Pepsico shares were modestly dented when the soft drinks group announced plans to cut some 1,800 jobs in its Frito-Lay snacks division. This will result in a $100m charge against third-quarter earning, while Federal Express, the express delivery company, reported a 60 per cent fall in net profits during June-Au- gust. Nor is there much sign in the US of the renewed bid fever which appears to have gripped London. Indeed, some US stockmarket columnists have been obliged to pay a rare deal of attention to UK- based stocks this week. On Monday, for example, the mostly actively-traded stock on the Big Board was Beazer, on the receiving end of a re- ommended bid from Hanson. For once, Wall Street can only look on with envy.

   "text_content" : "By Phip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor A N ENVELOPE may soon thump on to your doormat invit- ing you to buy shares in a new investment trust from M&G, one of toe UK's leading fund management groups. This is certainly the most ambitious fund launch since the 1987 Crash. About 2%m households will be mailed and the managers have a top fund raising target of Â£500m, although Â£150m is their more realistic aim. So how should the private investor view this offer? At first sight, it looks rather com- plicated. The new trust, M&G Income, has a split capital structure with three separate classes of share. But most investors can for- get this. They are being offered a packaged unit at 100p, con- sisting of the three types of shares combined. They can thus view the package as a conventional UK income growth investment trust. The trust will invest, in accordance with M&G's philos- ophy, in high yielding and recovery stocks and smaller companies, aiming for an over- all gross dividend yield of 6.55 per cent. And it is mainly being marketed as a Personal Equity Plan (PEP), so any income and gains thus held will be tax-free. Viewed as an income invest- ment, then, the trust looks quite attractive. A basic rate taxpayer putting Â£6,000 into the Leeds Liquid Gold account, for example, would receive a net return of 6.9 per cent, just 0.35 per cent above the yield on the M&G PEP. Higher rate tax- payers would only get a 5.5 per cent return from Liquid Gold. M&G also offers something a building society can not: the prospect of a steadily growing income. Then there is the hope of capital growth. The average UK income growth investment trust achieved a 65.9 per cent rise in the three years to Sep- tember 1, and a 239.4 per cent increase over seven years. Both figures allow for the rein- vestment of net income. Of course, as the saying goes, past performance is no guide to the future. The kind of high yield stocks which M&G will buy tend to have cycles of good and bad performance. The last two years have been poor ones for recovery stocks and small companies as investors have flocked to recession proof, blue chip stocks. The record of John Allard, the manager of the new trust, is a good example. He has been responsible for the General and High Income unit trusts since the late 1970s. The former has performed well over the past seven and 10 years, earning a place in the top 25 per cent of its sector. But over one and two years, its performance has been below average. The High Income fund is also above the average for its sector over seven and 10 years, but below it over one, two, three and five years. However, there are plenty of people who are convinced that the tide is about to turn for recovery stocks and smaller companies as the UK moves out of recession. So the M&G issue could be well-timed. But might not other trusts in the same area be more attrac- tive? The conventional prob- M & G's new investment trust looks complex but worthwhile lem for a company launching an investment trust is that shares in such trusts often trade at a discount. Investors thus ask why they should pay full value for the assets of a new trust when they can get the same assets elsewhere at a cut price rate. At the moment, however, UK income trusts are trading at only a very narrow discount. TR City of London, for exam- ple, the best performer in the sector over seven years, is on a discount of only 1 per cent and yields 5.2 per cent, less than the M&G offer. Moreover, split capital trusts such as M&G's often trade at a premium. This is because the ability to separate the qualities of income and capital growth is attractive to certain investors. This additional demand has so far been greater than the abil- ity of the investment trust to supply it. The three classes of shares in the new M&G trust are zero dividend preference, income and capital. They will trade separately after the issue, but if you hold the package in an M&G PEP, you cannot split It up. Those who want to do so, should buy the shares through a self-select PEP. The zeros pay no income, but will be repaid at 102.46p in 2001, when the trust is wound up. This is not guaranteed but the trust's assets need to grow at only 1.25 per cent per annum to ensure repayment. On that basis, the zeros are offering a yield of 11.5 per cent per year, a better rate than other zeros on the market. They can be traded separately after the issue (outside the M&G PEP) and are likely to trade at a premium to their asset value of 34.5p, perhaps around 37p. The zeros will appeal to those who want assured capital growth. Unless you are likely to use up your capital gains tax exemption, you can hold them outside a PEP. The income shares will receive all the trust's gross div- idend income of 6.55p per share, but will only be repaid at a nominal 0.lp when the trust winds up. Other shares of a similar type yield around 14 per cent; on that basis, the income shares could trade at about 47p. The capital shares will get all the assets of the trust after the zeros and the income shares are repaid. Although they have an initial asset value of around 60p, the capital shares are risky; if the trust's assets do not grow, they will be worthless. Even assuming, however, that the capital shares trade at a 60 per cent discount, they would be worth around 24p. Adding up the rough values of the three classes of shares gives a total of 108p, 8p 'above the issue price. The question for investors is whether that potential \"free\" 8p counterbal- ances the heavy initial charges, which at around 6 per cent are much higher than for a normal investment trust. Some money could be saved by opting for an execution-only service such as Boyton Sinan- cial Services (tel: 0787-61919), which will handle the deal for Â£57.50. (The conventional com- mission will be Â£180.) My view is that the chance to put the full Â£6,000 into a tax-free broadly-spread invest- ment trust is sufficient to out- weigh the charges. The M&G offer is worthy of serious con- sideration.",

   "text_content" : "Philip Coggan thinks that only a few investors can benefit fromaoffshore trusts T HERE IS something exotic about the idea of investing offshore. \"My money's stashed away in the Caymans\" is a better line to drop into dinner party conversation than \"I've opened an account with the Halifax.\" But aside from the social cachet, are there any serious advantages to investing off- shore? The answer is yes, but for a limited number of people. For the vast majority of UK citizens, there are few good legal reasons to invest off- shore. UK residents are liable to be taxed on their worldwide income whether it originates in Gillingham or Guernsey. And an offshore-based stock market fund that invests in UK equities will still receive its dividends net of tax and will thus have no real advantage over an onshore fund. Of course, everyone knows - although those who run off- shore financial companies are usually chary about admitting it - that some people invest offshore with the sole intention of evading tax. The Inland Rev- enue is constantly attempting to track down such people, however, and if you do evade tax and are discovered, you will have to pay not only the back tax but interest plus a penalty which can be 100 per cent of the tax due. Greater financial liberalisa- tion in the UK, and the accom- panying closure of some old offshore tax \"loopholes\" mean that the benefits of such investments have been greatly reduced. Non-taxpayers who were attracted by the ability of offshore banks and building societies to pay interest gross, for example, can now receive the same advantage onshore. There are also negative sac- tors, such as the more lax systems of regulation, and the lack of investor compensation schemes, in some offshore financial centres. Bermuda, Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man all have investor compensation schemes; some other centres offer limited protection in a few areas. The majority does not, so caveat investor. One should be particularly wary of those who call from overseas and try to sell you shares in diamond mining com- panies, go-ahead software groups and the like. The best *bCh rcÂ·, Ufl1LAZ alÂ·'* ~~ II .* ...................J-^*;...' E AC JS.E thing to do with such calls is to put the phone down. There are sharks in the off- shore market who rely on the fact that investors, greedy for tax gains, will not pay enough attention to detail. However, there are legitimate invest- ment areas which may appeal to some savers. Investing in an offshore roll-up fund. These are funds which invest in deposits but roll-up, rather than pay out their income. At one time, such gains were classed as cap- ital gains, not income, but this is no longer the case. They still have some tax advantages. Such funds are not them- selves subject to tax and inves- tors are only taxed if they redeem their holdings, or switch from one fund to another. That allows individu- als to defer tax until the situa- tion is more favourable. For example, someone who is about to retire - and move down from the higher rate to the basic tax rate bracket - might be attracted by such a fund. However, tax rates are cur- rently quite low by historical standards and there is a risk that they could rise again. You need to have a fairly good rationale for deferring tax. The market leaders in this field are N M Rothschild, with its Old Court range of funds, and Guinness Flight (see else- where on page). Such funds also offer a range of foreign currency accounts, giving the UK investor the best route for backing his judgment on exchange rate movements. Expatriates. British citizens who work abroad only have to pay UK tax on income arising in the UK. There is thus an advantage for them to hold their assets in an offshore account that pays gross income. In addition, a working expatriate who expects to move from country to country may find it simpler to keep his assets offshore, than to move them with every career switch. Those who expect to become expatriates in the near future may also like to place their assets offshore in order to make it easier for them to gain access to their funds later on. Some may want to keep their money abroad as a bolthole in case a more hostile tax regime is imposed in the UK. It is important to remember, how- ever, that nowadays expatri- ates are entitled to their per- sonal allowance - currently Â£3,295 - so some income can be earned onshore. Managed funds. It is possible to receive income gross from an onshore building society if you are a non-taxpayer. How- ever, it is not so easy to receive income gross if you want to invest in a managed fund onshore. In contrast, offshore funds can provide this facility and there is a vast range of such funds available, sited in places such as Jersey, Bermuda and Luxembourg. Offshore umbrella funds, which allow investors to switch between different asset categories at low cost, may ir also appeal to the wealthy :o investor. However, one needs n to look very carefully at the a. investment record of the fund ir concerned. You may easily find n that investing in a UK-based e fund, and paying the full tax, is is still more profitable in the long W- run. I- Offshore trusts. The tax r- treatment of offshore trusts ly added a further layer of com- i plexity in the 1991 Budget. However, it only affected capi- le tal gains tax and trusts set up mn by UK-domiciled settlors. Caro- if line Garnham, tax partner at v- Taylor Joynson Garrett says re that \"Settlements established to up by non-UK domiciled set- id tlors are still capital gains tax free and depending on who can Is benefit from the trust and on id what the trust's investments ,h are, trust income can be free of es income tax until, it is brought d into the UK.\" However, the legal advice I, needed to avoid the tax traps to and the cost of maintaining the et trust abroad means that only a iy few can benefit. C O IN ain ofshe ftund selecting an onshore unit trust. First you have to decide which asset category - equities, bonds, or currencies - has the beat prospects and then you have to choose the fund manager who is likely to produce the best performance. The danger is to opti or a fund that it top of the short-term league tables because its pirticuirly specialisatlon is ii vogue. Long term consistencyof performance is more reliable. The following are funds which have achieved an above average performance in their sector over 1, 2, 3, 5,7 and 10 years: (figures in brackets show the 10-year growth offer-to-offer with income reinvested.) Asian funds show the biggest nominal increases over the last ten years but the fact that one asset category has performed well in the past is no guide to the future. The list accordingly displays the most consistent funds across all the sectors and Illustrates the wide range of options available.

   "text_content" : "ANCY maing mort- gage iymnts for 99 years? That is the lat- est addition to the complex world of home loans; adding to the choices for buy- ers already faced with repay- ments, endowments, penalon, Pep-linked and foreign exchange mortgages. The new ultra-long-term mortgage has been launched this week by the Life Associa- tion of Scotland with funds from C&G Guardian. Aptly named Eternity, this is a monthly interest-only mort- gage with, to all intents and purposes, an indefinite repay- ment date. There are no frills to this mortgage - no savings plan, no home contents policy, no mortgage protection insur- ance, not even a life policy. \"This is a one-stop mortgage, the idea is that you will not need to take out another mort- gage,\" said Simon Brookhouse for the Life Association of Scot- land. Like other repayment mortgages, it allows the bor- rower to choose how to repay the capital. \"You make the savings arrangements to allow you to repay the capital how and when you wish,\" said Brookhouse. There is a drawdown facility which allows the person taking out the mortgage to borrow against the value of the prop- erty. The maximum that can be borrowed is the difference between the outstanding mort- gage amount and 92 per cent of the valuation of the house. For example, if the mortgage is for Â£60,000 and the house is valued at Â£100,000, the hom- eowner would be entitled to a drawdown facility of Â£32,000 at the prevailing rate of interest. There are a variety of inter- est rate options available. A launch offer knocks two per- centage points off the standard rate for the first six months, giving a current rate of 9.75 per cent. There is also a fixed-rate mortgage of 9.95 per cent for one year. Borrowers can opt for stabi- lised payments for up to two years, if the loan is below 70 per cent of the valuation of the house. They can select a reduc- tion of between 0.5 per cent and 3 per cent off the standard rate, as long as the latter does not fall below 10 per cent. How- ever, this interest saving is rolled up and added to the out- standing value of the loan. Home buyers can borrow up to 92 per cent of the value of property costing up to 150,000; this drops to 85 per cent for remortgages. Those buying homes in the Â£150,000 - Â£900,000 range can borrow up to 85 per cent of the value. The mortgage is being sold through independent finaticial advisers, with an arrangement fee of Â£100 added to the loan. There is also an early redemp- tion penalty in the first five years of two months interest unless a new mortgage is taken out with C&G Guardian. Up to 25 per cent of the capital can be repaid without incurring this penalty. There are a number of new fixed rate mortgages on the market. Woolwich has launched two fixed rate mort- gages, both available on an endowment or pension based mortgage only. The first is fixed for two years at 10.25 per cent and the second is for five years at a rate of 10.4 per cent. At the end of the fixed rate, the mortgage reverts to the stan- dard variable rate, currently 11.5 per cent. Citibank has also brought out a three year mortgage at a rate fixed in two parts. The rate is held at 9.95 per cent to January 1993, and then at 10.95 per cent to January 1995. There is a fairly stiff arrangement fee of Â£500 which can be added to the loan. A two-year fixed mortgage from Allied Irish Bank will be available from 30 September. The rate of 10.5 per cent will be held until 4 December 1993. There is an arrangement fee of Â£195 and the mortgage is not available on repayments. AIB's own customers can apply from next week. Family Matters, the mort- gage broker, has made some best buy recommendations. It selects a 9.95 per cent two year capped mortgage from Coven- try Building Society and a 9.3 per cent fixed mortgage from Nottingham Building Society, which is held until November 1 1992.

The Company's portfolio will be managed by M&G Investment Management LiUmited along similar lines to the M&G UK income unit trust funds. SUBSCRIPTION DURING THE OFFER PERIOD Package Units Package Units will be offered for subscription at 100p each. Each Package Unit will consist of one Zero Dividend Preference Share, one Income Share and one Capital Share. * A straightforward investment. Investment in the Package Unit will equate to investing in an ordinary share in a high yielding UK investment trust without a split capital structure. * Offering the prospects of rising income and capital growth. The Package Units are designed to offer investors above average and increasing income over the life of the Company in the same wayas M&G's UK income unit trust funds have done over the last ten year period.The initial forecast annualised gross yield at the Offer Price of lOOp is 6.55 per cent based on a forecast annualised net dividend equivalent to 4.91p per Package Unit. * Quarterly Income Payments. Dividends will be paid four times a year. Full Â£6,000 PEP * PEP Investments. The Company will be a qualifying investment trust and will provide the opportunityfortax free investment of up to Â£6,000 under theOfferfor Subscription of Package Units. PLACING In addition to the Offer for Subscription of Package Units, S.G. Warburg Securities will use reasonable endeavours to seek placees for Zero Dividend Preference Shares and Geared Ordinary Units (consisting of one Income Share and one Capital Share). DEALINGS AFTER THE OFFER CLOSES Dealings are expected to commence in the Package Units, the Geared Ordinary Units and the Component Shares on Tuesday, 29th October. 1991. Investors will then be able to deal in Package Units, Geared Ordinary Units and the Component Shares as they will all be separately traded on the London Stock Exchange. This ability to deal in the Component Shares as well as in the Units is expected to improve the aggregate market value of the Company, relative to its net asset value. ISSUE STATISTICS Package Geared Zero Dividend Units Ordin Units Preference Shares Price per Unit/Share lOp 34.5p Forecast initial gross dividend yield 6.55% 10.0%- Gross yield to redemption - - 11.5% Initial net asset value per Unit/Share 94.55p 60.05p 34.5p BACKGROUND AND INVESTMENT POLICY Spit Capital Inestment Trusts A split capital investment trust has more than one class of share capital.As at 22nd August 1991the combined market capitalisation of all UK investment trusts with some form of split capital structure amounted to over Â£2 billion (Source- Datastream).The shares issued by these investment trusts were on that date valued by the stockmarket at 3.6 per cent above their estimated underlying net asset value. The Package Unit has characteristics similar to an ordinary dhare in an investment trust without a split capital structure. However, once dealings commence and the Package Unit can be split up, investors who are seeking income as opposed to capital growth can purchase Income Shares; those seeking a predetermined return in the form of capital can purchase Zero Dividend Preference Shares; and those seeking leveraged growth with no income can purchase Capital Shares. The Geared Ordinary Unit provides a composite income and capital unit offering a high initial gross yield and capital gearing. Investment Objective The Company's investment objective will be to provide its Package Unit holders with an attractive total return derived from a high starting yield and an increasing level of dividends, together with capital appreciation. At the Offer Price, the Package Units will have a forecast annualised gross dividend yield of 6.55 per cent, based on a forecast annualised net dividend of 4.91p based on a notional 12 month financial period to 31st October, 1992. This expectation rests on achieving a prospective yield, on the initial assets of the Company following the Offer, of 738 per cent for that period. This currently represents a yield of approximately one and a half times that of the FTActuaries All- Share Index. The Company's portfolio will be modelled on those of M&G's UK income unit trusts which have a long established record for income and capital growth. One of the Company's prime investment objectives will be to increase dividends each year overthe Company's lifewith overall increases at least equal to the increase in theRetail Prices Index. Inetmet PlPefcy The portfolio will initially be comprised of listed ordinary shares in companies returning above average yields, smaller companies (that Is, companies capitalised at under Â£250 million) and recovery stocks. The Manager's experience leads it to the view that shares with these characteristics can deliver a growing income as well as capital growth atleast equal to that of the market as a whole. Whilst the initial portfolio is expected to be exclusively invested in UK companies, the Manager may select overseas shares which it believes would suit the Company's objectives. No investments in unquoted securities will be made. It will be the intention to ensure that: -The interests of the holders of the Package Units,the Geared Ordinary Units and the Shares are balanced at al times. -The investment policy will be such that the Company will be a qualifying ivestment trust Although the Company may borrow to a limited extent to fund short-term ihnestment opportunities, it is not the present intention that any significwant long- term borrowings will be made.The Companymayparticipate in underwriting public share issues.

I i I I r I Underlying investment is in M&G Income Investment Trust P.L.C., a new split capital investment trust with a planned life of ten years. The investment objective of the Company will be to achieve above average and growing income as well as capital growth from a portfolio consisting predominately of UK listed ordinary shares. The Company aims to provide an initial gross dividend yield approximately 40 per cent higher than that of the FT Actuaries All- Share Index as well as a real growth in income over the planned life of the Company. The Company's portfolio will be managed by M&G Investment Management Limited along similar lines to the existing M&G UK income unit trust funds. Package Units are being offered by the Company at 100p each. Each Package Unit will consist of one Zero Dividend Preference Share, one Income Share and one Capital Share. Investment in the Package Unit will equate to investing in an ordinary share in a high yielding UK investment trust without a split capital structure. Package Units are designed to offer investors above average and increasing income over the life of the Company in the same way as M&G's UK income unit trust funds have done over the last ten year period. The initial forecast annualised gross yield at the offer price of 100p is 6.55 per cent. New Investors If you have not already subscribed to a PEPin the 1991/1992 tax year you can put between Â£1,000 and Â£6,000 of Package Units into the M&G Full PEP between 20th September and 17th October 1991. Remember this opportunity closes at 10.00am on 17th October after which date applications will not be accepted. Please note that investments can only be made in multiples of Â£1,000. Existing M&G PEP Holders If you already have an M&G PEP, M&G will be sending you a special form, and you should not complete the PEP application form in this document. Income Dividends from M&G Income Investment Trust P.L.C. will be paid quarterly. In addition, there will be four tax repayments from the Inland Revenue each year. You can choose either to have all of these paid automatically into your bank account; or to have them reinvested in further Package Units of M&G Income Investment Trust P.L.C., thus enhancing the value of your PEP. Initial Charge There is no initial charge for the PEP. The promotional costs payable by M&G Income Investment Trust P.L.C. will range between 6.76% and 5.04% of the price of each Package Unit depending on the size of the Company:the more successful the launch, the smaller the charge. These costs include a 4.76% fee to M&G Financial Services Limited for promoting the Company out of which it will pay all marketing costs and commissions. If you choose the reinvestment option there will be a charge of 5% plus VAT deducted from the dividends or tax repayments. Annual Charge M&G Income Investment Trust P.L.C. pays an annual investment management fee to M&G Investment Management Limited of 0.75% plus VAT and a custodian fee, estimated to be 0.1% plus VAT, to Clydesdale Bank PLC; both calculated on the net assets of the Company. PEP holders pay an additional annual management charge of 0.25% plus VAT to M&G Financial Services Limited. How to Apply for the M&G Full PEP Complete the application form headed \"M&G Full Â£6,000 PEP\" and send it with your cheque or banker's draft to be received no later than 10.00am on 17th October. 1991 at National Westminster Bank PLC, New Issues Department, PO Box 33, 153-157 Commercial Road, London, El 2DB. Applications received after that date will be returned. Cashing in your Plan You can sell all or part of your holding at any time by sending written instructions to us. If we receive your instructions before 11.00am the Package Units will be sold in the market at 2.30pm that day at the market price. Instructions received after 11.00am will be treated as received on the following business day. Reinvestment of these proceeds into another M&G PEP fund is not possible. Further Information We will write to you confirming your investment in early November. Twice each year we send you the annual and half yearly Reports and Accounts of the Company together with a statement and valuation of your Plan made up to 5th April and 5th October. Prices of Package Units will be quoted daily in the Financial Times. The price of shares and Package Units and the income from them can go down as well as up. You may not get back the amount you invested. The value to you of the tax benefits will depend on your own circumstances. The tax regime of PEPs could change in the future.

   "text_content" : "S Benjamin Franklin put it: \"In this world nothing canbe said to be certain;, except death and faxes. In spite of this dictia, many hate paying tax, and refuse to regard it as inevitable; This, unfortunately, can lead to some poor deciaions. There are worse fates than paying tax, and the govern- ment may well be a much more worthy recipient of your money than some of the sinan- cial operatives offering tax-sheltered investments. If an investment makes no sense, the fact that it is tax-es- ficient should not matter. However, remember that the introduction of independent taxation for husbands and wives, and the abolition of composite rate tax paid on bank and building society accounts, has made it much easier to avoid tax. If you are a non-taxpayer, quite a number of investments which do not have tax deducted at source will be very efficient for you. The following products may suit if you regularly pay income or capital gains tax: 1 Personal Equity Plans - investing in equities. PEPs allow you to invest up to Â£6,000 in equities per year free of income or capital gains tax. From next year, you can take out an additional PEP with a limit of Â£3,000, which invests only in one company. But beware of paying as much in charges as you would otherwise have paid in tax. PEPs are of most use if you are a higher rate taxpayer or if you accrue capital gains above the annual Â£5,500 threshold. 2 Personal Equity Plans - investing in collective trusts These have more obvious applications for smaller inves- tors, as they automatically spread risks. They also have lower chariges. The maximum investment per annum is only Â£3,000, except via a new issue, but for smal investors these are an exciting option. If you wanted to invest in unit or investment trusts long term in any case, then it is foolish not to invest via a no-charge PEP. 8 Business Expanslen Scheme companles - assured exit The Business Expansion Scheme is undeniably very tax- efficient. For top-rate taxpay- ers the opportunities to shelter from tax are excellent. Assured exit schemes invest in property, which is then con- verted into assured tenancy accommodation. You then receive tax relief at your top marginal rate - in other words, if you pay 40 per cent tax, you effectively are given 40 per cent of the investment for free. Assured exit schemes then contract to sell the prop- erty to with other companies at the end of five years. Rates on offer can be as high as 140p for every Â£1 spent. Serious problems would arise if the company which had covenanted to buy back the property after five years went bankrupt in the interim. Maxi- mum investment is Â£40,000. 4 Business Expansion Scheme companies - nonassured exit These schemes aim to buy properties at cheap prices (caused by the current reces- sion) and sell them for a profit in five years. The lack of an assured exit makes them much riskier than the covenanted buy-back schemes, as you may not be able to retrieve your money immediately after five years, but the potential for high returns is there. These are best looked at as attractive tax shelters for .the very ealthy who do not mind tak- ing a few risks. They are not for the small investor. 5 Friendly Socetlss Highly taxefficlent on a small scale. Friendly societies are similar to life insurance com- panies, but it is possible, pr- vided you Invest no more tan Â£18 per month or Â£200 per year and keep saving for at least ter years, to put your money into a fund which pays no tax at all. No tax need be paid on the lump sum you receive at the end of the contract. Children are also allowed to hold friendly society bonds - something which does not apply to other tax conicessions such as PEPs and Tesses - which adds to the attractions. Returns over ten years for the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Mriendly Society's withipoft bondwork out at about I4per cent per annum tax free. For a 40 per cent taxpayer, that is the equivalent of a grossed up return of 23.33 per cent. 6 Enterprise Zoe Trusts This i arguably the greatest tax giveaway f alor, those wealthy enough to take advan- tage. Bear in mind, however, the inherent risks of commer- cial property investment, which are likely to be all the greater if the property is in a designated enterprise zone and thus in a run-down area. There is no maximum limit on investment, although syndi- cated trusts have evolved to allow relatively low invest- mees d(the minimum for virtu- ally every scheme is Â£5,000). As yo ld eceive a rental vield in'addition to amy capitol tn we the building is sold, the tat dvantages could be substantial. However, there are a number of potential traps. Nobody has yet tried to sel a building owned by a trust, and it could be difficult for Investors to unlock their money. 7 National Savings Fixed interest investments could lok good in the current econoiric climate, and National Savings offers just uch issues free of all tax. You have to be prepared to wait five years, but the current rate on offer of 8.5 per cent (14 per cent if it were grossed up) looks attractive to many. 8 ladex-linked National Savings Their prime purpose is to guard against increases in inflatio and they guarantee a retur eldor five years, of 4.5 per cent, above inflation. Many economists now think this L going to be low for some time to come - the level needs to stai below 4 per cent for the fied-ilnteiret issue to beat index-linked. 9 Tax-itiapt Special Saver Accoahts Tessas undoubtedly have a part to play in virtually everybody's financial plan. You can put in up to Â£9,000 over the five-year life of the account, and receive interest free of tax. The problem is that you cannot withdraw any of your capital during the five years without losing the tax concessions. However, you can withdraw interest. As the net interest should still be competitive, there is no reason on grounds of tax-efficiency for taxpayers not to put money already earmarked for building society investment into a Tessa. 10 Endowment Policies. Life assurance policies into which you make regular contributions over a period of at least ten years qualify for tax relief on the finhal pay-out. Those who pay capital gains tax, or income tax at the top rate, might therefbre find them useful. They certainly allow you to invest much more than tax-free friendly society bonds. Bear in mind that charges on life assurance products tend to be high, to pay for administration and the element of protection involved. John Authers j -I",

   "text_content" : "W HEN independent taxation was introduced, I fol- lowed the advice given by my former colleagues on the Financial Times and transferred our assets into my wife's name. By the start of the tax year in April 1990, the money was invested in a deposit account with a bank in Jersey, a sub- sidiary of a well established City finance house, which pays interest gross. My wife informed her local tax office about the invest- ment, completed the tax return (her first for decades) and paid the tax assessment for 1990/91 well within the due date. Imagine her surprise and chagrin when last week she received a tax demand from her local tax office for 1991/92 for twice the amount that she had paid just over three months previously. Her sole income is the inter- est on this deposit account. Interest rates on this account have been falling in line with the general movement of UK interest rates. If this trend con- tinues, she does not expect her interest payments for 1991/92 to exceed those received in 1990/91. But her local tax inspector had assumed that her income would be increased by 25 per cent, apparently rounded up to the next Â£100, and charged her tax for the whole year for this amount, in spite of the fact that my wife has only received five months interest payments. He even enclosed a paying-in slip and stamped addressed envelope to the Collector of Taxes, conveying the impres- sion, at least to my wife, that everything was cut and dried and she had to pay the tax bill within the next few days. The warnings of the penalties for delay in payment were promi- nently displayed on the notice. Fortunately, she read the information on the notice about the rights of the individ- ual to both to appeal against the assessment and to apply for postponement of paying the tax. And that such appeals had How Eric Short got his wife to fight her tax demand to be made within 30 days. She made her appeal setting out the reasons why the assess- ment was completely unrealis- tic and sought postponement of payment of any tax until the end of the tax year on the grounds that it was unfair to pay tax on income not received, that the amount could not be determined until the end of the tax year and that the amount of tax would be comparatively small However, she had to pay her own postage to send the appeal to her local tax inspector. There was no pre-paid enve- lope to enable her to send her appeal - again conveying the impression that all was settled. When she eventually received a reply, she found to her alarm that the amount postponed was described as Â£00.00p and the full amount of tax was immediately due. On phoning the tax office to query this, a woman told me that she had entered the figures in the wrong columns. The amount due immediately was nothing; the tax was postponed. The advent of independent taxation resulted in many thousands of women having the opportunity of holding sig- nificant assets and receiving a sizeable income in their own name for the first time in many years. It also meant hav- ing to deal directly with the tax inspector - a salutary experience. But women in this position should not be frightened of the tax inspector, nor treat him as omnipotent and his tax demands as bills to be settled immediately. The tax assessment should be checked to see if it is both accurate - if it is a final assessment based on a tax return - or reasonable, if like this latest demand it is an \"estimate\". And if there is any doubt, seek an explanation, after an appeal has been lodged. Taxpayers have the right to appeal, but only within the 30 days of grace. After that, the assessment stands and if the tax paid turns out to be too great when the final assess- ment is made, the overpaid tax is returned, usually without interest."

   "text_content" : "Premium Properties T HE RICH are different, and the market for their homes operates in a different way from any other. In the first place, a far higher than average proportion of British town houses and country estates traded for' several million pounds a time are bought and sold by international owners. In London, large tracts of Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, as well as some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in St John's Wood, Regent's Park and Hampstead and Highgate, are truly cosmopolitan. In the country, the level of international buyer competition for important houses and estates tends to relate to their proximity to Heathrow Airport. Britain's political stability, its language and its position as a convenient base for international trading has made it the first choice for second homes for the world-wealthy. The wealthier the buyers the more likely they are to appreciate a good deal. Consequently, the comparatively poor performance of sterling on the international exchanges adds to the appeal of a home in Britain. Once established in Britain, these premium-priced second home buyers join those wealthy domestic owners who constitute a small but influential market-within-a-market for the most expensive properties. In an age before air travel opened to the mass market they would have been summed up as the \"jet set\". This inner market trades or collects homes for any number of reasons unconnected with either personal accommodation needs or cost. Corporate and individual status is an important influence on demand. Many of the largest privately-owned town and country houses are \"corporate embassies\" rather than private residences. The quality, size and location of the property justifies its cost in terms of the confidence-building effect it has on business contacts. Many have distinct areas used as the family flat - the home within the house, staff accommodation, quasi-office space and areas for business entertainment. Comparisons in price between these and normal family houses are as misleading as comparisons between, say, a Volvo and a Rolls-Royce. Both represent quality transport, but the statement made by having a Spirit of Ecstasy on the bonnet justifies a premium that would be hard to justified in terms of accommodation, comfort, speed, or comparative resale values. Creating the right image is critically important for most premium-property buyers. That has been well Illustrated recently by a distinct reshuffle, especially in the country, of business leaders trading down from overtly grand stately homes bought in the 1980s to more modest, yet simarly expensive, quality properties. The stately homes made too raucous a statement for their more cost-conscious corporate images in the 1990s. Fashion has a profound impact on this market as well. There is a steady turnover of super-priced homes as owners are beguiled by the latest work of a fashionable interior decorator or residential developer. Wealthy owners trade in the old model for the new, much as they might exchange cars, and with much the same frequency. Other owners extend to houses their enthusiasm for collecting. Every top estate agency has its own \"black book\" of possible buyers to contact when a good example of a particular property type becomes available. Now that a complete set of 18th century dining room furniture can cost more than the house it was made for, collectors' interest in the top slice of the very best properties is not as fanciful as it might first appear to the average homebuyer. However different the market, values at the extreme upper end of the UK housing stock are as sensitive to the economic climate as any of their less expensive neighbours. In the 1980s, a combination of sharply rising corporate Oxieworth Park, Gloucestershire, a nine bedroom Grade I I lted house with 300 acresm, was sold for more than Â£5m In 199. This yer It went for Â£2.25m profits, the rush of high priced international takeovers of traditional City of London partnerships and director-owned companies, and the greater ease with which the owners of growth companies could cash-in their founder-equity on the UK's new secondary stock markets, created a fresh generation of cash-rich quality homebuyers. Several hundred new-minted UK millionaires, who were not shy of supplementing their cash with heavy company-secured borrowings, joined the lists of premium-property buyers with an inevitable upward pressure on prices. In the past two years that influx first halted and then moved into reverse as a fair number of 1980s winners ended the decade over-geared and vulnerable to recession. They have been forced to trade down andout of the premium market at much the same time as the one-off residential developers, which specialise in refurbishing individual homes for wealthy fashion-conscious owners, have been squeezed from the market by high financing costs. In any normal market, the loss of those buyers would drag down the averages of both asking and achieved prices for equivalent properties. There is clear evidence of that in the Elm to Â£3m town property range, where UK buyers predominate. Cash problems, often compounded by health or marital crises, have resulted in more people wishing to trade down at a time when few are willing to trade up. The resultant oversupply of this bottom layer of super-price properties has forced dramatic reductions in asking prices where owners have no choice but to sell, and an overhang of unsold homes that no longer justify the Elm plus price tags they acquired in late 1980s. Above that, in the exclusive market for multi-million pound houses and estates, quality still determines price without undue reference to the state of the UK housing market as a whole. There may be fewer home-grown multi-millionaires competing for the best houses and estates. But it takes only two to make a market and there is a world of potential buyers for Britain's top homes.",

   "text_content" : "A ONE THIRD reduc- tion in interest rates, a crude average fall of 10-plus per cent in achieved sale prices for houses, and a 7 per cent increase in average salaries in the past year combine to make the rela- tive costs of buying a home some 40 per cent lower than in 1990. That is the potent \"afforda- bility cocktail\" mixed by Tony Snarey, chairman and chief executive of Royal Insurance's William H. Brown network. He hopes it will encourage the window-shoppers at his estate agency offices to become buyers. At much the same time, Jim Birrell, chief executive of the Halifax Building Society, reported a four-times increase in bad debts on home loans and record provisions against prospective repossession costs. He also confirmed that the society was standing back from the market, allowing its share of new mortgages to decline and ending 100 per cent lending because of concern about the effects of unemploy- ment. These two views summarise the case for and against pro- spective first time buyers entering the market now. Across the UK, employment worries act as the antidote to cost reductions. \"Confidence\", that ill-defined but critical sac- tor, has been badly shaken by events of the past few years. First time buyers underpin the rest of the market, enabling existing owners to sell and move and providing housebuilders, directly or indi- rectly, with a market for new homes. In its most recent model of the housing market the London Business School estimated that as much as 20 per cent of the price ries in the 1986 could be attributed directly to the excess of buying pressur over housing supply as young adults from the 1E9 and eary 1970s \"bby boom\" reached household -formati age.

More than 100,000 repossessed properties priced low to achieve quick sales Is not what the housing action groups envisaged when they drew attention to the need for more low-cost housing. Even if such sales d draw some first timers into the market it is at the expense of an equal number of reluctant exiles from the sector.

   "text_content" : "Would have bn ti.3nm-t.Bm In '89 New -on sa or t 00,00+ SIMPLE arithmetic ought to make retire- ment homes the ulti- mate recession-proofed sector of the housing market. The increasing number of elderly home owners might suggest that demand for pur- pose-built homes would be very strong. Yet sales of all but the highest quality homes are sluggish, and they lean heavily upon developers' special price offers, deep-discounted loan offers and other incentives. Potential demand for retire- ment properties depends less on the ageing of the UK popu- lation than on the increased number of older people with an existing home to sell. Forty years ago only 20 per cent of the over-50s were owner-occu- piers. By 1970 that figure was 48 per cent. It has since risen to 64 per cent, with 50 per cent of the over-65s owning their own homes. In 7.3m homes the head of the household is over Wg; in 3m the head is over 75. By 2000 the comparable number of house owners over 60 will have risen by a quarter and the number over 75 by 10 per cent. Set against those figures the supply of purpose-built homes for the retired is insignificant. To rehouse all the potential older homeowners some 600,000 10 Egston Terrace, SWS, a r.e bedoom torn hous, is mod er smilar prlopros Stt.3m to Lji In 1h sheltered homes would need to be built each year to the end of the century. However, no more than 50,000 such homes have been completed since the mid- 1980s. Why, then, are pensioners not queueing to purchase what the Builders' Federation defines as homes \"purpose built or converted exclusively for sale to elderly people with a package of estate management services which consists of grouped, self-contained accom- modation with an emergency alarm system, usually with communal facilities and nor- mally with a resident warden\"? Guy Mossop, a founder direc- tor of Beechcroft Estates, one of the few specialist companies concentrating on high-quality retirement homes costing from Â£100,000 to Â£250,000 or more, confirms the sector's bad image. \" The term 'sheltered housing' conjures up images of nursing homes or meals-on- wheels; and buyers dislike the idea of communal living.\" Companies such as Beech- croft create good-sized, high specification homes designed to minimise household man- agement problems without any impression of the site being an old-people's \"ghetto\". But qual- ity of this type is rare. In the past few years even those who would like to trade across have been caught by the slow-down in sales and the slide in resale values of their existing houses. Unlike home movers trading across or up the market who can treat any reduction in their own home's resale value as an opportunity to make savings on the new home, \"last-time\" movers are acutely sensitive to resale val- ues. Older homeowners who viewed 1987-88 peak resale prices for their home as an opportunity both to buy a retirement property and to release capital have seen that hoped-for level of free-capital fall with prices. This cash disincentive and a general reluctance to antici- pate the problems of ageing are the two most important rea- sons why demographic pres- sure has yet to translate into sales or more manageable homes. Given the sluggish sales of purpose-built retire- ment homes it is hard to fore- cast the shape of this market in the 1990s. What market evi- dence there is weighs heavily in favour of the extremely lim- ited number of higher quality \"serviced housing\" schemes. In these developments occu- piers tend to be self-selected by price. The most common com- plaint on these schemes is that many retirees wished that they had made the move earlier. These are the owners who have traded down to a final home without trading down their standards of housing. They are, and look like remain- ing, the minority in a sector where the advancing age of customer is still widely treated as an excuse to produce a sec- ond-rate product.",

Among the rich, a French- man's home can well ^e bis castle, and is more oftenlikely to be a real chAteau than among Britain's moneyed home owners. Among the.peow ple at large, the sentiment at least is similar. \"Home is the last refuge of liberty,\" says architect Alain Sarfati, a gov- ernment adviser on town plan- ning, quoted by Theodore Zel- din in his book From The French. \"In France, people tend to think of housing as an inheri- tance. If you buy, it is a long term investment which you plan to pass on to your chil- dren, while in the UK and the US, housing is seen more as a consumer item,\" says Guy Nafilyan, chairman of the French division of the US housebuilder Kaufman and Broad, which specialises in building upmarket properties for executives.

That average covers huge local differences, with Paris and its suburbs generally leading the market, in same way that London tends to set the pace in the UK.

   "text_content" : "GERMANS are incor- rigible wanderers. Their traces - HB cigarette packs, Nuts bar wrappers - have been found in parts of Africa unknown to Africans. They have dawn-raided poolside loungers from Torquay to Thai- land. But even Germans have to go home: and home is where the job is. \"Flexibility,\" says a young professional, still under 35 and with four enviable jobs behind him in four different German cities, \"is a very important thing to have on your CV.\" An unusual item, too, in British eyes. He is now thinking of moving on again. \"Perhaps to settle down,\" he says. But by settling down, he means finding a company which will see him through the rest of his working life. And he fully expects - even hopes - that this will involve a peripa- tetic progression to the top of the career ladder via postings in any city or any country that his superiors propose. Settling down might also involve getting married. He might even buy a flat or a house. But he would not dream of living in it. He prefers, in the interests of flexibility and self-marketability, to live in rented accommodation. Any surplus from his property, he says, can go in a bank savings deposit and maybe pay for next year's safari. He is not wholly characteristic, but he is a common enough character; his habits and habitat moulded by the post-war economic and social history of Germany. He is single, a city dweller, eats out most days, does not need a large home, and certainly does not want a garden. Half the households in west German cities comprise only one person, and 63 per cent of the homes in the old Federal Republic house no more than two people. Around 70 per cent of west Germany's housing stock has been built since the Second World War, founded on the ruins of fine but forgotten cityscapes. It is not a pretty sight. But the low-rise, purpose-built apartment buildings are solid and serviceable, compact rather than small. Tenancy laws are equitable, comprehensive and rigidly adhered to. Building and ulanning laws, on the other hand, have tended for most of the post-war period to discourage ownership. Rents, although the Germans gripe, have been relatively modest and, importantly, stable. Renting became a way of life - like buying in Britain - because it was easier. Free of the ancillary and unpredictable costs of home ownership (if the roof blows off or the boiler blows up, the landlord takes care of it) the white-collar householder has relatively large volumes of cash for good living. In 1987 - the last time a reliable count was done - the government discovered that more than 60 per cent of the housing stock was rented. Homes rented from the private sector outnumbered public sector dwellings by more than two to one. The census produced two surprises. One was the revelation of a sharp increase in the incidence of home ownership.- to 40 per cent from around 30 per cent 10 years earlier. The second was more of a shock: the common belief that the Federal Republic had homes to spare was dispelled by the revelation that it had Im too few. The upshot was a surge in residential building which produced a 10 per cent volume increase during 1990. Pressure on land prices and interest rates increased the cost of houses and rents. Even though rents rose by an average of 4 per cent last year - compared with 2 per cent for most of the 1980s - the pressure has been intense in larger towns and cities, where 20 per cent year-on-year rises are now common in the more desirable areas. In the urgency to fill the housing gap, the market has reverted to post-war type: in the first three months of this year completions rose a further 8 per cent. But all the growth came in homes for rent and the number for owner-occupation declined to 14 per cent. The market has been further complicated by the post-unification move to the west of some 800,000 footloose east German job- and house-hunters. Local public housing bosses such as Peter Kaminski in Leipzig, who has 150,000 homes on his hands, are hoping to sell their stock to the tenants. But there has been no rush - even at bargain prices averaging Â£15,000. Like their western cousins, the East Germans are careful savers and financial planners. And what are they saving for? Long term, 40 per cent say they want a home of their own. Like their cousins, they also covet new cars, clothes and appliances. But most of all, after 40 years walled up in the DDR, they want to see the world. Christopher Parkes",

There.are no accurate ~fg- ures for the total number of holiday and retiremedt oesa. bought by the British inSpaoin Best eatiz~t~ei range upwards from a250,000' ias and flats. In the second half of thIe 60s, as UK lenders encouraged owners to jortgage and releasie ee equity in their homes, and marketed foreign property loans, British buyers were reported to outnumber all other foreign purchasers by four to one in Spanish resorts along the Costa Del Sol and Costa Blanc. This steady influx of villa and apartment buyers from the UK has slowed to a trickle over the pat two years. As Sandra Lewin, director of the Interna- tional Property Owners' organ- isation, says: \"As sales have quietened, developers find that they have not got the capital to complete phases of some major schemes; it is leading to the bankruptcy and total collapse of others. Because of the buid- ing boom there are too many properties on the market.Wher- ever you go you see edifices with cranes not moving, and piles of bricks.\" The 4,000-strong Interna- tional Property Owners has had few reports of problems from the holiday property areas of France, Italy or Portu- gal. Spain is another matter. Sandra Lewin says: \"Thou- sands of people are phoning us up, worried and saying that 'we have a problem' or 'our development is going to auc- tion, can you help?'\". These owners are in resort schemes where the financing banks foreclose on the develop- ment company and organise forced sales of the schemes to in aikt: mhi villa n-r Sologrand. In 8pain ha sad ln pric, by Â£100,000 to 475,000 recoup their loans. Unless the villa owners' rights to their propertyare Indisputable, they can find their vila or apart- ment sold from under them. \"The problem in Spain is that, even where the laws exist, there is little administra- tive intervention to ensure that they are kept,\" says Lewin. \"You come across instances of complete apathy about whether a building meets its planning consents, or if a developer has met his civil law requirements on bank guaran- tees and insurance. Officials may drive past and say, 'that building shouldn't be there', and that's about it.\" Sandra Lewin gives the example of a development with planning consent for 44 inde- pendent villas that emerged as a 100-apartment complex. If such a developer runs into financial problems, buyers can find that the ownership rights they believed that had paid for simply do not exist because it is an illegal development. The problem is widespread because local councils, keen to attract the revenues that for- eign owner-visitors bring to their community, have been willing to turn a blind eye to breaches of planning controls. At the same time few British buyers have thought to check whether the development that looks appealing as a holiday base in the sun has any over- riding mortgages registered against it, whether it is subject to any court proceedings, or whether the development they see bears any resemblance to the building consents that it is supposed to comply with. Spanish developers' recent sales problems have created a happy hunting ground for can- tious bargain hunters.panish city dwellers, who traditionally rent a holiday property, have been reported among the buy- ers taking advantage of devel- oper-discounts on apartments this year. Scandinavian, Ger- man, and French buyers also have been helping to fill the gap left by the British in better quality schemes. The sales incentives offered on unsold new projects have had a devastating impact on resale values of older Spanish coastal properties. As sales in the new homes market have slowed, the resale market for lower quality holiday houses and flats has been depressed. Among the worst hit have been Britons who bought homes in developments that subsequently have been deval- ued by later over-building in the area. If they wish to sell they cannot compete with developers in terms of market- ing, price discounts or the inherent appeal of a new prop- erty. Those who retired to such schemes on fixed incomes, hav- ing found their living stan- dards eroded by high retail price inflation, now find it well nigh impossible to sell at other than give-away prices.

   "text_content" : "TE HROUGHOUT much of the 20th century, housing was at the centre of political debate. From the slogan of \"homes fit for heroes\" after the First World War to the slum clearance programmes of the 1950s and 1960s, politicians vied over the amount of new housing they could create. Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964 with a promise to build 400,000 homes a year, and by the 1966 general elec- tion talk was of 500,000 new homes a year. Now none of the political parties makes any promises on numbers and scarcely 200,000 homes have been completed in each of the last few years. Housing investment is at its lowest for decades, yet the issue is almost absent from political campaigns. Is this because the housing problems of earlier years have been solved? More than 3m new homes have been built since 1971 and on average there are two rooms for every man, woman and child in the UK. Fewer than 3 per cent of homes in England now lack basic amenities such as indoor lavatories and hot water, com- pared with 17 per cent in 1971. But this success story in bricks and mortar has been accompanied by growing prob- lems of access to housing. The most obvious is the mounting level of repossessions from peo- ple who have bought their homes and cannot afford the mortgage payments. Then the problem of home- lessness Is increasing. Last year 145,800 households were officially accepted as homeless by local authorities in England - almost three times the num- ber in 1978. Shelter, the cam- paign for the homeless, esti- mates that more than 400,000 individuals have no home. some estimates put the under- lying total much higher. Behind these figures lies a Scarcely 200,000 homes have been completed in each of the last few years. John Willman reports I trend towards polarisation of choice into a two-tier housing market. On the one hand, there are the owner-occupiers who enjoy tax reliefs, flexibility and control, in return for tying their savings up in housing. On the other, there are ten- ants in what is now called the \"social housing\" sector - homes built by councils and housing associations for rent. They benefit from some hous- ing subsidies and freedom from worries about repair and main- tenance, in return for lack of control or flexibility and access by rationing. Privately rented housing is a third option, but now only of marginal lmportance, in decline since the irst World War and now accounting for less than 7 per cent of the housing stock. Determined efforts over the past ten years to kickstart private landloids through tax incentives and new forms of tenure, such as shorthold have had negligible impact on the secular trend. One result of this polarisa- tion has been the huge jump in the level of owner-occupation, from just over 50 per cent in 1971 to 67 per cent in 1989. Many people have been forced into owner-occupation - in some parts of the country it is the only option for young peo- ple who are not prepared to make themselves homeless as a way of gaining priority for social housing. A second factor in the growth of owner-occupation has been the sale of council houses to their tenants (more than 1m homes since 1979). A third is the decline in house building in the social housing sector. In 1977, local authori- ties and housing Msodations completed 105,000 hp; In 1991-2, completions by local authorities and housing ads oc-l ations :are projected to tal just 35o000. With a contant drain of 'stock through riMgt-- buy, it is hardly surprising that waiting lists show no. sins of fadling. Housing researchers and campaigners show remarkabte agreement about what should be done, well summarised in the two reports of the Duke of Edinburgh's Inquiry into Brit- ish Housing. Their most impor- tant prescription is that tax relief on mortgage interest should be phased out. This would release almost Â£8bn a year for more deserving causes. Some or all of this could be used to increase und- ing for social housing and to encourage the revival of the private rented sector. In private most politicians will accept that the continua- tion of mortgage interest relief is indefensible. But neither of the major parties dares prom- ise to abolish it (to their credit, the Liberal Democrats have said they would abolish the relief for new borrowers). An alternative possible source of funding for new homes is the almost Â£6bn of capital receipts remaining in local authority coffers from the sale of council houses. Local authorities may spend only 25 per cent of these receipts on new housing under govern- ment rules, which insist that the rest is used to repay coun- cil debt. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have prom. 1,ed to release this money for council homes. The government would pre- ser to see future social housing needs met by housing associa- tions rather than councils, but there is scepticism about their ability to fill the gap. The Housing Corporation, which funds and regulates housing associations, predicts that it will be able to build 40,000 homes in 199S4, far short of the 100,000 social homes a year which independent forecasters, such as the Institute of Hous- ing, estimate will be needed until the middle of the decade. Even if the problems of the social housing sector could be solved, there are difficult issues in the provision of pri- vate houses. The chief cause is the imbalance of economic growth between the different regions of the UK. With the economy more buoyant in the south than in the north, pres- sure on the housing market remains acute in southern England, while surpluses remain in the more depressed north. There is some evidence that companies have begun to examine over the past decade the attractions of areas such as the north and north-west as a way of escaping the overheated labour markets of the south. But the imminent opening of the channel tunnel and indus- trial development around the M25 have convinced planners that pressure on housing will remain acute in the south-east for the foreseeable future. Forecasts released by the department of the environment in August predict that the number of households in England will rise by almost 3m in the next 20 years. This is almost 1m more homes than had previously been forecast, an increase which mainly reflects trends towards smaller households caused by divorce, single parent families and an House price earning ratio 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 lVuU o I/u to OU Uo vu Source: Housing finance. August 1990 (Council of Mortgage Landers) and UBS P&D etirnales for 1990 and 1991 ageing population. The growth - the equivalent of building every home in Lon- don again - will still be con- centrated in the south, how- ever. The number of households is set to rise by 25 per cent in East Anglia, 22 per cent in the south west and 15 per cent in the south east. The increase will be just 7 per cent in the northern region (Cum- bria, Cleveland, Northumbria, Durham and Tyne and Wear), while the figure for the north-west will be 9 per cent. For several years, now, ministers have been avoiding the difficult question of where to locate 570,000 new homes which would be needed in London and the south east by the. beginning of the next century. This figure was based on the earlier lower forecasts of hpusehold growth and the environment department is now revising its estimates of the number of homes now needed. Developers argue that as many as 750,000 new homes will be needed and that to meet such ambitious targets will require a relaxation of planning controls to create new towns and villages, particularly in the green belt ringing London. When Nicholas Ridley was environment secretary, such arguments in favour of liberalising planning controls received a sympathetic hearing. But campaigns by voters in Tory heartlands of the south against new residential developments convinced his cabinet colleagues that it would be wiser to accept the existence of the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome, rather than challenge it. The battle over plans to build a new village in Hampshire called Foxley Wood led to the burning of Ridley's effigy and is widely thought to have contributed to his fall. His successors have called a halt to such electorally-damaging projects. The problem of where the new homes are to be built remains. Michael Heseltine, current environment secretary, has advocated a corridor of development along both sides of the Thames to the east of London to solve much of the problem at one stroke. However, his cabinet colleagues are thought to be resisting a move which would alienate the voters in key Conservative-held marginal constituencies in Essex and North Kent. This jittery approach is probably all that can be expected until after the general election. Then, whichever party wins, there will be the opportunity to attack these intractable housing problems. But since solutions necessarily threaten the vested interests of large groups of people, it will not be surprising if the election manifestos remain silent on housing policy.",

   "text_content" : "IKE THE \"plough- man's lunch\", owning a second home in Britain is an artificial tradition. The innocent combi- nation of bread, cheese and pickle acquired a fresh history as a marketing exercise for pub food. In much the same way, and in the same post-war period, a \"place in the coun- try\" has come to exert a potent charm over middle-class town dwellers. There are about 300,000 sec- ond homes in Britain. There are no formal records of the number of holiday homes bought outside the UK since the end of exchange controls in 1979, but estimates suggest that there are as many British- owned second homes abroad as at home. The economic case against homeowners buying and man- aging from a distance between 500,000 and 600,000 second properties is persuasive, but largely ignored. The old estate agency adage about never own- ing two roofs is backed by a wealth of evidence that rural dreamers ignore. Look beyond the basic bur- den on two-homeowners of the dual expenses of fitting-out, repair, maintenance and local taxes, and it is a generation since a place in the country could be justified on the grounds of swift capital appreciation. Second-homeowners looking for a rural idyll in Britain would need a time machine rather than an Ordinance Sur- vey map to find an area where the price of a holiday home is still tied down to local, rather than pitched up to national, prices. It is easy to pinpoint the period at which second home- ownership started to become a section of the housing market in its own right. Before the Second World War those who could afford to move the family across country for a holiday either rented or borrowed accommodation. Circum- stances changed in the 1950s, when capital taxes, exchange controls, job opportunities and The second home market has turned sour. John Brennan analyses the past, the present and the future of the sector a surge of capital investment in agriculture came together to create the conditions for a domestic second home market. Charges on income and transfers of wealth forced land- rich, cash-poor estate owners to sell to survive. They auc- tioned peripheral estate houses, vacant tied cottages and entire villages to preserve their core estates. This was supplemented, and swiftly became overtaken, by the release of a spectrum of farm-related housing following the industrialisation of agricul- ture. As redundant farm work- ers headed for jobs in town, villages lost the critical mass of their resident populations. At the same time, a post-war generation of white collar workers and professionals found that they had never had it so good. They became the new urban villagers, the increasingly mobile long dis- tance commuters and the first generation of second home- buyers. The wide availability of surplus properties and low local demand meant rural properties were irresistibly cheap by comparison with their own homes. An unmodernised Georgian rectory in Berkshire is a con- tradiction in terms now. But in the early stages of the town- dwellers' love affair with the countryside, a good choice of such houses could be found for less than Â£5,000. Cotswolds' cottages costing a few hundred pounds a pair tempted even the least bucolic of weekenders to become second home-own- ers. Although the suspension of exchange controls diverted much holiday property buying from the Shires to the Costas in the 1980s, by then the inva- sion of the countryside was sufficiently well established to have ensured a strong national resale market for modernised properties. Pioneer second home-buyers were tempted by bargain coun- try prices. Their successors could talk of a sound invest- ment to justify prices targeted at those with town incomes. Until the past few years, resale values have been underpinned by a sharp, and on occasions, spectacular, imbalance in sup- ply and demand. Once the void created by the departure of the farming com- munities had been filled, green belt and country planning restrictions ensured that the supply of village properties remained static. On the other side of the equation, any attempt to chart demand for a place in the country would show a sharply rising curve with only occasional dips at the time of the first and second oil crises. That demand curve took off like a rocket at the start of the 1980s. Interest in a second home in the country soared in a glorious adcde for the mak- ers of oiled jackets, green boots, off-read vehicles, and the publishers of country life- style magazines destined for the Oee tables a would-be squirearchy living in Kening- ton and Baterse. Demand reached such a pitch that an entirely fresh crop of rural proprties was drawn into the mar ke to- ry-fandcers lest any sense of distance in their eort to fid a hoeam.

In the 1990s, without the past decade's ease of cash release from fast rising equity in town houses to fuel demand, the sec- ond homes market might seem to be a prime victim of house price deflation. There is already evidence of a sharp reversal in the resale value of those poorer quality and less accessible country properties, Today, there is a largely unchallenged buyers' market fnr more remote houses. There is virtually no interest in the least well con- verted of those multi-occupa- tion farm out-building. Equally, country cottage owners no longer expect to find a queue of prospective buyers for their meticulously modern- ised weekend home. Those who have lavished money on the property are finding that the swimming pool and the exten- sion add little to the sale value. Country agents confirm a continuing interest in second homes, just as they report undimmed enthusiasm among their window shoppers for country homes enabling them to make a permanent move out of town. Those who are snap- ping up the repossessions and forced-sales of second homes purchased on credit in the con- sident 1980s tend to use capital. As Charles Ellingworth, of the buyers' agency Property Vision, says: \"In the past 20 years people have become much more environment con- scious, not so much 'green' as wanting to have a place where the children can run about in a field and not be in danger of being mowed down by a taxi. \"They are investing in the quality of life, which means that is not simply a matter of pounds, shillings and pence. It is more the sense that the fan- ily will grow up better in a country environment.\" They are keen to be green, but not at the expense of going deeper into the red. That implies a sharp dip in the demand curve as the numbers of prospective second home- buyers is trimmed to those with the cash to buy without adding to their borrowings. But this does not imply any across-the-board collapse of values, because buyers have become more dicriminating. This is terrible news for the owners of the kind of coaching- lamp lit, crazy paved, and horse brass bedecked over-con- versions that have turned so many knocked-together frm- workers' cottages into rural versions of suburban sems. But a return to a more objec- thve view of country property values as a whole does not ply a retreat hm the sec- obd home marktasa whole.

Owners may have precious little time to spend in their second home, they may accept that there is no sinan- cial justification for buying or retaining it, but this is a mar- ket where pragmatism bows to more powerful emotions. Few second home-buyers weigh property values alone. They are investing in a coun- try lifestyle - and there are no valuation tables to measure the premium that continues to justify. Dream cottage - but the market for second homes Is feeling the pinch",

With the choice of Two Investment Areas designed specially to meet the needs of both the sisk conscious and the slightly more adventurous BES investor. The proposed closing date for applications is I p.m. on October 4th 1991. If all companies are fully subscribed before that date then, at the Directors' discretion, the offers may close early - so, if you are interested in the Besres VII Schemes please act now. All investments willgo into BES Companies set up and advised by Sun Life Investment Management Services Limited (SLIMS). These Besres Companies will invest in residential property for letting on assured tenancies. The objectives of all the Companies will be to maximise returns over five years, based on capital gain and rental income. * TWO STRATEGIES TO CHOOSE FROM * The PHOENIX Companies will invest in residential properties, aiming to benefit from large discounts or development profit combined with relatively high rental yield. This should produce a return similar to that of assured exit schemes, even if property prices remain constant, so offering the investor the prospect of excellent return - with only moderate riak. * The CAMPUS Companies adopt a strategy of providing residential properties for Universities, Polytechnics and other organisations with an option to sell the property back at a pre- arranged premium at the end of five years. The sale option will be secured by bank commitments or legal charges over assets. SLIMS is targetting an uplift in the Companies net asset value per share of 32% from the issue price of shares over five years. So investors will enjoy a high rate ofreturn with a very high degree ofasecurity. * EARLY TAX CERT11IFICATES A valuable feature of the Besres VII Schemes is that all Companies should have already started their BES qualifying activity, so investors should receive tax certificates as early as December 1991. * NEW WOPONS * GOumlmed Income for five years can be secured using an Annutty/Besres combination, an excellent guard against falling interest rates. On current Annuity rates for higher rate taxpayers, the Plan will provide income of about 9% p.a. after tax AND all the growth in value of the shares. * Delyds -aoe - loans of Â£15,000 and over will be available from the Bank of Scotland on security for Besres VII Campus Companies shares from January 1992. * 'THIB mIO SUMS SUMS promotes the Schemes and acts as adviser to all the Beses Companies.

On a map the Queen Char- lottes hbng like long drips of water from the down-thrust arm of the Alaska panhandle. By the standards of these islands - two large and 150 small ocean-ringed dumps of muskeg and forest - England is a dry, comfortable country. The west coast of the Char- lottes is the wettest place in Canada - it receives 450 cme of rain a year. Old Masset, closer to the eastern side of the Islands, is said to be drier. But to the unpractised eye, the sheets of rain that batter the village at the pebbly mouth of the Masset Inlet look nonethe- less record-breaking. Like the long smooth ocean swells that roll towards the shore, the weather has trav- elled great distances over water to get here - it comes south from Alaska, westwards over the Hecate Straights, or eastwards across the grey Pacific from Japan. Whatever its provenance, it brings mois- ture. Lost in mist, luminescent in pearly-grey fog, or lying bedraggled under a steady downpour, the Queen Char- lotte Islands are remote, romantic and damp. But whatever the weather, come springtime many of the inhabitants of Old Masset drop whatever they are doing and head up the narrow inlet by boat. Helped by the tide, they travel some eight miles, through heavily forested coun- try, to a small inland sea. Where the clear, tea-coloured Yakoun River flows into this little sea, they beach their craft. They will pass the next month in this remote place, sleeping in rough wooden cab- ins and spending the long northern spring days out of doors. Whether in rain, cloud, mist or even fleeting bursts of sun- shine, the Haidas are wholly undeterred from their task. Not even swarms of mosqui- toes and blackflies distract them from the enjoyment of this, the high point of their year. And in fact there are few people, at least few fishermen, who would be distracted. A lit- tle piece of paradise, the Yak- oun is one of the finest fishing rivers in the world. If radiocarbon dating is to be trusted, Haida Indians have lived on the Queen Charlottes for more than 10,000 years. Totem poles, longhouses, and finely-carved canoes attest to a long and rich cultural life. Few other tribes in North America have built their society on such a wealth of marine, ani- mal, and forest resources. But if there is one central event around which Haida life revolves, it is the annual run of sea-going fish to and from their river spawning grounds. Today deer, elk, beaver, eagles, otter and the largest black bears in the world abound on the islands. All are noble beasts, but none compare to river-running salmon and sea- going trout, the kings of the Queen Charlottes. For commercial and sports fishermen alike, the waters off these islands offer some of the richest salmon fishing on the The waters off the Queen Charloes offer some of the richest salmon fisthing on the west coast of North America west coast of North America. What brings the salmon - sockeye, cohoe, chum, pink, and chinook - are the same ocean currents that bring their mild, wet, ice-free winters. Returning to spawn on rivers as far south as California, salmon which have spent their lives feeding in Arctic waters are funnelled, quite literally, past the Haida's front door. Only a tiny proportion of these salmon started life in the rivers of the Charlottes, but when the sockeye run begins here in May, the Yakoun river boils with fish. Some are taken by the Haidas, who, with legal food-gathering rights reserved to them alone, gather salmon with hand-laid nets. On a May morning at the mouth of the Yakoun, I spoke to Carmen Goertzen, a Haida wood sculptor. It had, he said, been a good day so far; in three hours he and a friend had gill- netted 260 fat, red-fleshed salmon. There were plenty of fish which got away from his net, but my own aspirations on the river were less ambitious. Inept at tying fish hooks and the victim of large numbers of fishless fishing expeditions, I was prepared to be be content with just a single catch. And in fact, I was going after a much rarer prize, the sea-go- ing steelhead trout. Averaging 12 pounds and weighing any- thing up to twice that, steel- head do not return to their spawning grounds in the num- bers that salmon do. They are %OwffwÃ½Ã½ - .W WWW 'r - Ã½ - also a cagey and suspicious fish, and difficult to catch. So, at least, I was warned in my guide to fishing in British Columbia. \"Steelhead are con- sidered by locals\", it said, \"to be the ultimate fishing chal- lenge. They are are formidable fighters and they attract a spe- cial breed of angler, one with patience and a willingness to endure some discomfort in the quest, such as wading to the waist in frigid glacial streams.\" In order to avoid ducking out of such an ordeal altogether, I got myself a different kind of fishing guide, a human one. Norm Desilets is an all-Cana- dian outdoor sportsman - from the top of his needle-nose pliers to the tip of his fly-tieing fingers, he is a model of fishing professionalism. But even he wears thick neoprene waders when venturing into the waters of the Yakoun. Happily, there was also a pair for me. Beginning high up the 35- mile length of the river early one day, I became a member of the elect covered by that ring- ing phrase, a special breed of angler who endures discomfort in the quest. For hours, thigh deep in very cold water, we fished reaches on the river where the current, water level, riverbed topography and a score of other obscure factors told Norm the wily steelhead would be lurking. Norm fished elegantly with fly-rod and light equipment, his line describing those lazy, floating overhead arcs that makes fly fishing a visual art. I, wishing to maximise my chances, said the hell with visual art and practised the unsubtle but usually effective technique of \"bottom bounc- ing\" - allowing the current to boince a hook baited with salmon roe along the bottom of the river in imitation of free- floating spawn. This cunning exercise had not the slightest effect. Norm, with no apparent effort at all, caught a good-sized steelhead and two cut-throat trout. I tried to hide my envy. Lunch, sandwiches and coffee on a rot- ten log, came and went in a fine drizzle and a tingling of toes slowly unthawing. Back in the river again, I became so excited when I saw a large steelhead cruise by, its dorsal fin rippling the surface of the water, that I got my line tan- gled in the buttons of my rain- jacket and made a magnificent 18-inch cast after it. Time passed. Rain fell. My toes froze again. I told myself that fishing was not really about catching fish, but about appreciating the beauty of the great outdoors. I did so. I watched the furtive move- ments of an otter by the water- side, followed the flight of mer- ganser ducks up the river, and met the steely gaze of a bald eagle from the top of a giant spruce. I gazed at moss hang- ing thick from the boughs of trees, smelled the rich odour of cedar and fir, and felt the brooding silence of the prime- val rain forest Norm caught more fish. My feelings for nature turned to feelings of chagrin. Minutes before it was time to go, I caught my fish. All the things that were supposed to happen happened. The fish struck the bait, I set the hook, the line screamed off the reel. The fish fought, I fought back. It was not a big steelhead; at 10 Ibs it was not even an average- sized steelhead. But a steel- head it was, and happy I was. I had come to the Queen Char- lottes, where rain is rain and fish are fish. Not only was I of that special breed of anglers who endures discomfort in the quest, I had triumphed in the quest. Who, I thought, damp and triumphant, could ask for more?",

   "text_content" : "M ONTREAL. 8.30 am. A bowl of milky coffee descends towards a tabletop at a pavement cafe. The middle-aged moustachioed mouth that has just refreshed itself turns towards a softer, younger, female counterpart. They meet. For several minutes. Croissant crumbs flutter to the check-tiled floor, dislodged by the kissing couple. Nothing else is disturbed, least of all passers-by. Hey guys! Don't you know where you are? This is North America, not Paris or St Tro- pez. You cannot behave like this! It certainly is not Anglo-puri- tan North America. Nor has it the formality of Hispanic or Asian courting. It is genuinely, marvellously, sensuously French. Even more French than the French, say the Quebecois. While France has allowed its language to be tainted with le weekend and le parking, French Canadians stick with la fin de semaine and le stationne- ment. They bank at the Caisse Populaire du Saint-Enfant Jesus de Montreal. The rudest word in the Quebecois lexicon of religious expletives is taber- nacle. And, unacknowledged, Mon- treal is very American. For every pastis, a personal pizza. For each dinner party debate on the books of Michel Trem- blay, a Ford Mustang rumbles down Rue Saint Denis. In the lobby: kisses on both cheeks; on the menu: lobster with a cherry on top. In the tiny Old Town, locals outnumber tourists. Sunday brunch - bacon, egg, sau- sages, pancakes and home cooked beans for $5 - is eaten off melamine tables. Two old men speaking in central Euro- pean accents complain intermi- nably of the price of boiled beef. A middle-aged roller-skater in Bermuda shorts sails by. A shopkeeper speaks English to a francophone customer. He quickly apologises. Just north of one branch of the Caisse Populaire du Saint- Enfant Jesus de Montreal is the tree-rimmed rectangle of Square St Louis. There, Mon- treal's successful novelists (including Tremblay) rub shoulders with marijuana- smoking academics and fans of alternative pop. (One Quebe- cois band has sacrilegiously made a disco song out of De Gaulle's 1967 speech in which he said \"Vive le Quebec libre\" and strained relations between Ottawa and Paris for years). In a trendy basement apart- ment on Square St Louis, I asked a lecturer why Quebec wanted independence so much. \"Have you read any history of our country written by a Quebecois?\" he demanded. \"A little.\" \"In English?\" \"Yes.\" \"Pah! They change it in translation.\" He had a twinkle in his eye, but he meant it. Toronto has francophones too but they are practically invisible, lost in the multicul- tural bustle of Chinese, Italian, Brazilian, Korean, Indian and other communities. Close up, Toronto is a shim- mering rainbow. No melting pot here. You know when you are in Greek Town or Little Portugal because street signs tell you so. There is even a Mirvish Village, so called because of one Ed Mirvish, a flamboyant entrepreneur who owns many of the shops there. Only the gay quarter escapes such labelling. Step back for a wider view and your vision clouds. Toronto is called a city but Torontonians lead village lives. Villages organise jamborees and shows: Toronto's galleries are well stocked, it has nice restaurants, there are plenty of theatres and annual festivals. The skyline is dominated by a concrete spike. The CN Tower is \"the tallest free-stand- ing structure in the world\". It does not deserve to be 1800 feet high, either through function (an antenna) or form. It is something a village puts up because it can. A mega-may- pole. While Montreal throbs with spontaneity, Toronto's civic energy seems to have been imposed from on high at great effort. The waterfront has been competently redeveloped. The public transport is fast, clean and safe. Shops are open late. People from Detroit think it is just perfect. The ethnic villages have made Toronto more animated in recent years. The Wasps, once blamed for running a con- urbation so damnable with faint praise, are now a taciturn minority that takes a holiday on Queen Victoria's birthday. In eastern Toronto, the Jet Daniel Green tries to measure Canada's heartbeat Fuel Cafe pours a few drops of espresso into the sea of hot brown water that swamps North America. Its stainless steel bar occupies a former liv- ing room above a restaurant that sells only desserts. \"The coffee beans are roasted in Montreal,\" explained the green-eyed pro- prietor John. He wears a Hans Holbein T-shirt and collects water pistols. The only customer on a sunny afternoon in May was a lesbian writer approaching middle-age. \"Have you read Jeanette Winterson?\" she asked me urgently. \"Well, actually...\" But she sank back into a brown study without waiting for a reply. The writing game is tough. \"I need inspiration,\" she sighed. \"I might have to go to Montreal.\" A few days earlier, I had taken a train from Quebec City to Montreal. Opposite me sat an actor - craggy features, thinning sandy hair. He was commuting to rehearsals for a new TV police series. He plays the cop who takes to drink after his marriage breaks up. Like all Quebecois, he spoke of his love for Quebec City, symbol of resistance to the conquering English. Of Mont- calm and Wolfe and the Plains of Abraham. Like all his profession, he feared for his career. \"Quebec City is my home\", he said resignedly. \"But I think I will move to Montreal.\" Now, you tell me where the heart of Canada beats. N Daniel Green travelled on Air Canada to Montreal. He was a guest of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario.",

   "text_content" : "Nicholas Lander concludes our summer series on eating out in France with a visit to a spa town in the Pyrenees SN 1945, when the ideal of physical beauty and discussion of leisure and good food were far from most Europeans' thoughts, Adrien Barthelemy very shrewdly bought the Domaine Thermal at Molitg- les-Bains. Today, his company runs thermal resorts from Jonzac on the Atlantic coast to the appro- priately named Bains-les-Bains close to Nancy in eastern France. Molitg - pronounded Molitch and Arab in origin - is obviously more accessible now but still seems isolated and beautiful. It has the natural advantage of being 450 metres above sea level and in full view of Mount CanigoU. The valley beneath, atered by the various tribu- taries of the river Castillane, ib lush and largely unspoilt. The tributaries flow into a large lake alongside Le Grand Hotel Ther l (Tel: 68.05.00.50), perha the most haunting of the proper- ties that Biche Barthelemy, Adrien's daughter, manages Molitg. This hotel boasts all the various treatment rooms which will reunite body and soul and also some atmo- spheric, liner-like architecture, carefully preserved since the I19m. It would make a wondaful location for any future Holly- wood remake of Thomas Mann's VThe Maic Miouta. Further up Molltg's twisting roads is the Hotel L Catalan (68.05.01.15) also run by the same company, with 80 studios but it is half-way between that one flnds the Jewel in the com- pany's crow the ChAteau ds Riel. Not that the ChAteau can compete in architectural terms. Its origins as a medieval for- tress are well and truly bow- dlerised. Internally, however, it has bee luxuriously restored and our spacious bedroom had ni ntru^nt*il vla- n t* ti vl- ley and its thousands of pine . trees in both directions. But it Is with the choce of the staff and the food at ChAteau de Riell that Madame Barthelemy has made her mark. The young receptlonist greed our baby In a friendly way. The porter, when he brought our car to the front door, politely and correctly told me why it needed a ser- vice. In the restaurant the sAm- meler, who for his holidays pik grapea for the vintage, has wheedled a number of gems out of local winemakers and on to his list, and the young mnttrw d' hopped from table to table conversing flu- ently with his guets th ee alu many restaurants of this quality service was with a smile and only taped music and the grotto-like bar area spollt the mne. The choice of chef is equally as successful although the hotel does inerit an important family connec- tioln. Madame Barthelemy's elder sister, Christine, is married to Michel Guerard, whom hotel and restaurant at uenolees- Balsn (WLO50 ) are cooaid ered among the finest in France. Guerad la also a mem- ber of the group Thermal du Soleil. Consequently, the hteaou de Ri.ll has its own p-top chef agency. Over the put 15 years three chefs, Rene Sarre, Marc Baudry and Gilles Ray all trained by Guerard, have established its culinary trdi tion. Last March it was the turn of Eric Marsanne, still only 26, but with a culinary scholing in the Jura and three years under Guerard's tutelr to prnulgate his style of Ing. The key elements of Guer ard's cooking - freshness, lhtness and the desire to Iet he food speak for itself rather- than be masked by sauces - are faithfully and expertly evegetable is given star billing. Almost every dish comes with a different vegeta. ble - not as something to fill the plate but to bring out the best in the food. A fillet of bream is served with a Jus of new season's onions, lenous- toMs with a cutit of tomatoes, a supreme of salmon with arti- chokes and wild mushrooms and a tournedos of hare with a copo of young leeks. Two other dishes showed ingenuity and culinary dexter- ity. Described as a tapenade of summer vegetables with red mullet, the fish had been cut into fillets, grilled until the skin was crisp and then topped with finely diced vegetables and coated in olive oil. A fillet of local milk-fed Pyr- enean lamb came with six dif- ferent, tender vegetables. The same confident touch extended to the desserts and all things chocolate. A vanilla souxfi was light and firm; a warm, bitter chocolate cake, still moist in the middle and served with a puree of pears, left behind not a trace of sweetness. The fol- lowing morning's small choco- late croissants were among the best. An early morning swim ensures that your, appetite is sufficiently stimulated to enjoy them. * ChAteau de Riell, Molltg-les- Bains, 66500 Prades, France. Tel: 68.06.04.40, fax 68.05.02.91.

   "text_content" : "THE 19091 season was not a very good one for the London wine auctioneers. Christie's - and Sotheby's which is reorganising its wine department - suffered heavy alls in sales to Â£8.24m. Despite a slackness in prices this year, 1962 clarets have proved a good investment over the years, as the table shows. However, that is the only vintage that would have been a good long-term buy when inflation is taken into account. Demand from the US, a large part of the market, has fallen as a direct consequence of the rising value of the dollar. The top table shows the real price rise for leading 1982 clarets from June 1983June 1991; the other shows the decline in top prices (Petrus is omitted as its prices are so much out of line). However, many lower prices were recorded. For example, this year the range of Laite '61 was Â£8,100 - Â£2,800, and of Palmer '82 Â£330 - Â£30. Moreover the best prices are usually obtained in the first half of the year. Although both auctioneers express confidence for the 1991/92 season, lower prices have discouraged vendors and there is a shortage of wine available. Nor is there any sign of a repetition of the mass-disposals by chAteaux and merchants that followed the energy crisis in the mid-1970s. Unless the price trend is reversed by a faster-than-expected recovery, the coming year should provide excellent opportunities for securing fine wines at bargain rates.

   "text_content" : "UMareade-Ranz IM13 2-1 -a aotar dirml sald in oumin is ma. urman I ' ' F OOTSORE and fatigued, I left the heat and bustle of Frank- furt's motor show, filled up the car and headed back to Britain. From Frankfurt to Aachen the auto- bahn is mostly derestricted, although there are some sections where 120 kph and 100 kph (75 mph and 62 mph) limits are not just posted but obeyed. Bel- giun's autoroute is limited to 120 kph. In France, as many homeward hurrying Britons have discovered, it really does not pay to break the 130 kph (81 mph) limit too blatantly on the near deserted A26 autoroute on the final leg to Calais. Even so, the 422 miles (679 km) between Frankfurt and the ramp lead- ing to P&O's Pride of Kent took under seven hours of driving at an average speed of almost exactly 100 kph (62 mph). There was a break for lunch; a mandatory visit to the Mammouth at Calais; but no stop for fuel. We still had a little way to go before the reserve light warned that the 12.1 gallon (55 litre) tank needed filling. Consumption for the journey - 38.3 mpg (7.37 1/100 km). And the car? No, not a smallish fam- ily hatchback with an engine of around 1.5 litres but a 2.5 litre Mercedes 190 with automatic transmission and bliss- fully efficient air conditioning. It was, of course, a diesel. There are diesel cars with higher top speeds, quicker acceleration and longer range than a 190D 2.5. A year ago I drove a turbo-diesel Citroen XM 700 miles (1126 km) from Wales to Le Mans via Paris on a single tankful at 45.75 mpg (6.17 1/100 km). It had manual gears and no air conditioning. But for sheer urbanity, no other die- sel cars available in Britain can match the Mercedes 190D 2.5 or its bigger brother, the 300D. Their engines. encap- sulated in sound damping material, spring to life in the morning with a chuckle, not a clatter. When accelerat- ing hard, their song is a baritone. Cruising at around 80 mph (130 kmh) on the autoroute and at rather more than that on the autobahn, whatever noise the engine made was drowned by the swish of tyres and rustle of wind. The 190D 2.5 is a solid, safe car of great integrity. The doors thud softly shut. It rides well, with never a creak on the roughest roads. The boot is big; two sets of golf clubs in trolleys nestle inside with room to spare. Up front, it is quite spacious though in the rear, leg- room is adequate rather than generous. The seats are well shaped if a bit on the firm side. Having no turbocharger, it does not exactly leap away from a standstill like its turbo-diesel engined rivals. It has to be said that front-heavy balance because of the extra weight of the 5-cyl- inder engine does nothing for its agility if driven fast on winding roads. But neither of these characteristics will be seen as snags by motorists mature enough to feel that tyre squealing starts at traffic lights are strictly for exhibi- tionists and that speeds should be mod- erated on country roads liable to be shared with tractors or horses. The 4-speed automatic transmission works with silken precision. Changes are almost imperceptible and the kick- down is gentle. Even so, I prefer engag- ing third manually by moving the selec- tor lever back one notch when I know I am about to need extra urge for over- taking. The automatic 190D 2.5 majors not on excitement but on its sheer worthiness. It strikes me as an ideal car for a motor- ist who genuinely cares for the environ- ment and does not just pay lip service to the need to protect it. Its exhaust emissions are as clean as those from a petrol car with the most sophisticated catalytic converter. Given proper servicing, they will not deterio- rate over practically the whole of its long working life. Because its fuel consumption is at least 25 per cent better than that of a comparable petrol-engined car, it puts that much less carbon dioxide - the so-called greenhouse gas - into the atmosphere. On top of all this its fuel is cheaper than unleaded petrol in virtually all European countries. (In France, where 40 per cent of newly registered cars are diesels, their fuel costs Â£2 a gallon which is about two-thirds the price of a gallon of petrol). The British government, anxious to be seen to be green, still seems unaware of the diesel car's environmental friend- liness. At least, it is doing nothing to encourage their use as company cars. Tax rules even work against them. Because diesels produce less power per litre than petrol engines, they need more cylinder capacity. This usually puts them into the next tax band. Driv- ing a 190D 2.5 (Â£20,640 basic, nearer Â£27,000 with all manner of nice things like air conditioning, automatic trans- mission, alloy wheels and radio) would cost a company car user-chooser dearly. Why diesels make good sense for the environmentally caring This cannot be right. Diesel car sales have been relatively buoyant in this year of recession. In absolute terms, numbers are down but as a proportion of the car market they are up. The forecast is that about 10 per cent of UK registrations in 1991 will be diesels against 8 per cent last year. Most will be small or small/medium saloons and hatchbacks in the Ford Fiesta and Escort, Peugeot 205/405 and Citr6en BX class. Business executives tend to prefer automatic transmission and two-pedal diesels are fairly thin on the ground. Other than Mercedes, only Vauxhall (the Carlton) and Citr6en (XM and BX) r list them at present. Even the excep- 1 tionally interesting Audi 100 with a f direct injection diesel engine is offered only with 5-speed or 6-speed manual r gearboxes. Fiat's super-frugal 2.5 litre 3 direct injection Croma diesel automatic is not sold here. 1 Cock-eyed company car tax situation apart, executive class diesels make good - sense for anyone who really cares for the environment and who likes driving well, not too quickly and aggressively. A few days ago it was reported that member states of the European Com- mission may soon agree to levy a $10 \"carbon tax\" on each barrel of oil. If they do, it will increase pump prices by between 25p and 30p per gallon (5.5p to 6.5p per litre) - and strengthen the economic case for the diesel car. t The car industry hopes the chancellor of the exchequer will remove the fiscal disincentives to executive diesel car usage in his budget next March. Last time, having explained diesel car bene- fits endlessly to government advisers I and senior civil servants, it thought the 1 message had gone home. But the chancellor drew back from i the brink. The industry - and the envi- ronmentally concerned - will be disap- pointed if he misses his second chance.",

   "text_content" : "James Morgan on how separatism is being viewed by EC governments will members of the European Community apply in deciding whether to recog- nise the independence of Croa- tia and Slovenia? The answer will be purely domestic, depending on whether there is a violent sepa- ratist force at home. Thus Britain, France and Spain are unenthusiastic. El Pais of Mad- rid even carries nervous head- lines like \"Euskadi (the Basque Country) is not Croatia.\" Italy is a tricky case. It seems almost as enthusiastic as the Germans about the breakaway republics. Yet Italy faces its own separatists, and things are hotting up in Alto Adige. This is where a few hundred thousand Germans,,or Austrians, live, and many would like to be Austrian again. They were detached from the Fatherland at the end of of the First World War. They call the Alto Adige the South Tyrol. The Austrian press is follow- ing news from the region with glee. Events in Yugoslavia have helped the separatists. Thus Die Presse of Vienna car- ried a whole page on \"Auton- omy Movements\" in central and eastern Europe and led off with the South Tyrol. The headline was \"Taboo-theme becomes respectable.\" Last weekend there was a \"Pan-Tyrol\" festival bringing German-speakers from both side of the border together in a festival entitled \"Reflections on Tyrol.\" La Repubblica of Rome talked to the secretary of the youth group of the German party in the South Tyrol, Christian Waldner. The interview demonstrated a certain mutual mistrust. \"We asked him to explain the 'socio- cultural' aims of the gathering but he read only a few phrases from the manifesto for the occasion. An ugly impression!\" wrote reporter Leonardo Coen. Back in Vienna, Die Presse quoted separatists who demanded that their \"fair\" stance be recognised. Italy had failed to honour the autonomy legislation that had been estab- lished for the region. The paper also quoted the Austrian Chan- cellor, Franz Vranitzky, as say- ing: \"There is no need for Aus- tria to depart from its basic South Tyrol policy.. .(Austria) is interested in bringing a package agreement to a conclu- sion.\" Which is about as ambiguous as you can get. La Repubblica argues that the fanning of German nation- alism in the South Tyrol adds to the strength of the MSI, the successor to the Italian fascist party. The MSI holds counter- demonstrations and sells T-shirts for 10,000 lire inscribed \"Thank God Im Italian\". The German Germans take some interest in all this. The Rome Correspondent of the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung wrote that \"earnest Romans\" (!) were enraged by suggestions of any diminution in the rights of the Italian pop- ulation of South Tyrol. Referring to the meet- ing which had attracted the hostile attention of La Repubblica, the FAZ's man argued: \".. . these get-togeth- ers involving South Tyrol clubs are of a harmless, benev- olent nature which neverthe- less are transmuted in the Ital- ian newspapers into SS reunions.\" The FAZ added Rome was \"shocked from its holiday mood when the Comiere della Sera, presumably against its better instincts, blew on the nationalist fire and upset its readers with its front page headline on Sunday: 'South Tyrol like Lithuania.\"' Paranoid thought of the week: the Adige, which pro- vides the Italian name for the region, is in German the River Etsch. The Etsch appears in the old first verse of the Ger- man national anthem as the southern border of that bit of the world in which Deutsch- land is supposed to be aiber Alles. The eastern border in the anthem is marked by the River Memel, now in Lithuania. NNE \"The schools are increasingly described as 'out of touch' or 'corrosive' and as being co-re- sponsible for for the increase in violence, crime, drug abuse and failure in our society. The blame is almost always attached to the shortage of teachers and the splitting of the school system between the old three-tier type and the new comprehensive ideology.\" \"The ruling establishment must ask what is the motive for thinking of the School as a secondary 'sector' of society in spite of the billions spent on education .. To British readers these complaints sound almost bor- ingly familiar but they come, respectively, from Die Welt am Sonniag of Hamburg and La Repubblica. A book published in West Germany in 1964 was called The German Education Catastrophe. It argued that unless things changed radi- cally the Federal Republic was going to be easily outstripped by East Germany thanks to its vastly superior education sys- tem. The book did lead to some reforms. Today the British are mes- merised by statistics showing that they have a lower propor- tion of 16 to 20-year-olds, or whatever, in higher education than any other developed nation. But we never see the proportions of four to six-year- olds who go to school, where Britain surely leads. That may or may not matter very much. But do we not know what all those older pupils are in fact studying. Last year in Washington I was told that huge numbers at \"university\" were in remedial reading classes. And what is to be made of statistics showing the large number of \"children\" of 27 to 30 in permanent higher education in Germany? * James Morgan is Economics Correspondent of the BBC World Service.",

(One came over on tm' car ferry with us - the o6ther got lost on a Gerian vineyard last month, and has Just been located, aided by a DM100 (Â£84) rewrd, about to leap off a wall in a nearby village, but that is another story.) I resolve how- ever never to buy anything with a turtle on it. These last *ouple of weeks in England have been the first time I have lived here for nine years, after spells as a correspon- dent in Paris and Bonn. It is a good way of taking stock of your home country. That- cherism has wrought its magic, and the sorceress has vanished into the ether. According to the Central Statistical Office, real disposable incomes at 1985 prices are 34 per cent higher than when I was last here in 1982. My firm impression is that Britain during this time has been taken over by an all-powerful supermar- ket-cum-video enterprises-cum-financial services conglomerate, probably run by prematurely retired high-fliers from the Cabinet Office. IfI they, of course, who are behind the trtles. Or are the turtles controlling them? It reminds me of Pleasure biland, the nd of play where Pinocchio and his freds were dispatched. Glitter on top, tswdriness underneath and, all the while, the boys are growing into donkeys. There are certainly some positive aspects, about being back in London. I have no complaints about the quality of public services: tennis courts, swimming pools, Wimbledon public library. (The swimming pool changing room cabinets, though, could do with some doors on them. In Germany, that alone would rank as a health hazard). I find the multiplicity of cultures refreshing. At the local Church of England school our nine-year-old daugh- ter attends, the hadmistress is a Spanish Roman Catholic with a south London accent, and a high proportion of the chil- dren are Moslems. My daughter reports that the boys in her class are much better behaved than the ones she left behind in Bonn, many of whom were diplomats' sons. They also serve appetising school meals, from an outside catering firm, at Â£4.55 per week. I relish the informality and the toler- ance. I like the unregulated shopping hours, and the way you can just walk into the home of a neighbour of a few minutes' acquaintance and call him \"Nick\" and dis- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t cuss the lines of his flower bed In Ger- many, I had got a bit tired of calling peo- pie I had known for years Hrr this and Erau that, and worryig about whether a Sfe had at last got to theitagf becoming a Du. Tolerance can, of course, drift into indifference and slovenliness. In a fort- night in London I have seen more unat- tractively tattooed women puffing at ciga- rettes than I did in five years in Germany. Maybe I moved in the wrong circles there. The liberal British approach to life is fit- tingly portrayed in people's teeth, which often look as if they have doubled as grinding stones. Only in East Germany do they have mouths to match, mysterious stalagnite-studded caverns, the product of too much bad meat and Honecker's health system. London life is full of surprises. The shops, have a free-wheeling atmosphere, like small casinos. After the telecommuni- cations revolution, you can buy a press- button pink-coloured telephone handset almost anywhere. Why though did I notice 15 people patiently queuing up at the local British Telecom emporium to pay their bills with flitfuls of five pound notes? Isn't all this liberalisation ultimately supposed to save the consumer time? Perhaps the -'Ou -orem right and the British really do lbve-queuing. In Britain, goods aresold not so much a the basis or quality - the emphasis on that can be overdone in Germany - but ' thrugh all kinds of inducements: money ffamoney back, free offers, threeo-the- price of two, Instant credit, gifts, vouchers; coupons, ibs holidays, competitions and reard. It is early & reult of bankng deregulat Behind the most nnocet tub ,of yoghurt, a complex financial pack Unpredictability spreads to people's behaviour. There is more pleasant eccen- tricity than in Germany, more loutishness too. Britons lack the pre-set codes of con- duct, strung out across the day, every day for the rest of your life like a never-endin computer program, which will make a Ger- man murmur Guten Tag in the morning and Auf Wiedersehen when he leaves a shop and Bitte sehr when his interlocutor has uttered some trivial politeness. Lack- ing these ritual filling phrases, we make up meaningless ones as we go along. \"It's all go, isn't it\" (when it isn't) and \"Never mind\" (when you do) and \"You'll get used to it\" (you have little choice) are my favourites; I find I use them myself. Re-entry to Britain brings lots of ques- tion marks. Do-It-Yourself chains have sprouted'everywhere. Why are the houses so run down? Envronmentally-frendly foods and goods of every kind stack the shelves. Why do people look so unhealthy, not just pasty-faced, but pasty-bodied to boot? If lving standards are 34 per cent higher, why are there so many poor people on the streets, old as well as young, scrounging from waste paper baskets, mournfully eating ragged sandwiches on public benches? There are lots of beggars in Germany too, manyofthem Immigrants who in Britain would never be allowed past Dover. Britain's poverty is all too obviously home-grown. The spread of charity shops deserves serious study. Where are all the shoi-keep- ers who used to be here a decade ago? Are they all working for building societies? Voluntary work is a good thing, and peo- ple should be encouraged not simply to throw away their old clothes. Britain has become a rag trade society. Is this all part of Thatcherite entrepreneurism? New wealth has certainly trickled into the open-all-hours corner-shop grocery in the nearby street where I used to live. The shop is twice the size that it used to be. The owner recognises me, after nine years (another good thing). He explains, pointing apologetically to the new wares, that his increased trade hearly all reflects alcohol and video films. My own view is that choice dulls consumerism rather than improves it: I cannot cope with the array of continental lagers in Sainsbury and Tesco supermarkets - to say nothing of the selection of water softeners which have proliferated like chemical weapons since I was last here. Like Pinocchio on Pleasure Island, I find it stimulating, but a bit bewildering. I expect I will get used to it, long before my ears start growing.",

   "text_content" : "Getting a grip: Derek Pringle has had a better yar with OI baH for Esex, Ie champions, and for England T HAS almost become an end-of-season ritual to sing the demise of county cricket. Last year it was because the hot, dry weather gave the bat such dominance over the ball that runs scored were prolific and results were rare. This year, ironically, it is partly because the West Indian tourists were so popular, attracting big crowds everywhere they went and making ordinary county games look like small beer compared to epic struggles such as the one Kent nearly managed to win off the visi- tors at Canterbury. But even county cricket, natural home of the mealn- choli who watches games sating on hard seats, alongside fewer fel- low spectators every year, found some help in this summer's Carib- bean populari The tour did a lot for crlkot, at county as well as Test and oneday level, amd there is a lobby amog the county secretaries, even those whose comnties hav had a rough time, which counts this as a good summer.

He feels, as do many county cricketers, that too many games are squashed into the season, with only the journeys in between to relieve the pressure. He blames this for leaving the players \"aded\" by the Septembe end of the season, less likely to play well. When Durham added to the numbers next year, the psMsure will intensify still trther and coun- ties such as ileex likely to lose Tufnell and Ramprakuh to Test duty gainst the Pakistnis, po- bly Fraser as well, hip pwimin and possibly even Gatt itera- tional cricket politics permitting, will have to organise their reaomces better.

   "article_dc_title" : "US Hungry for Return to Power in the Ryder Cup",
   "text_content" : "T HERE WERE ten of us round the table, and since the table belonged to a house little more than two hefty wood shots from Sunningdale golf club and most of us were golf- ers of one sort or another, it is pretty clear that the talk was of golf. Like a boat straining at its anchor, the conversation fought to break away. I remember Corey Aquino being discussed, and also the Green Party and one or two other topics. Always, though, the conversation returned to its moor- ings, to golf and specifically who would win next week's Ryder Cup match in South Carolina. \"We'd better have a sweepstake,\" said The Man from the BBC reach- ing for his wallet and appointing me official stakeholder. He lent me a pen and a piece of paper and I went round the table soliciting votes. The Man from the BBC plumped for a commanding American victory 18%-9%. Four others supported this view. There was a prediction of 18-10 in favour of the Europeans, not to mention some odd predic- tions. When there are 28 points at stake, how can one side win 15-10? In vino veritas, indeed! In the end the mathematicians among us got to grips with this problem and the votes were equally cast, 5-5, between those who predicted an American victory and those a Euro- pean victory. It is the most even Ryder Cup for years. I think the US will win by bringing their greater fire power to bear in the singles, as they so often have in the past and as they do in the Walker and Curtis Cups as well. Although this is undoubtedly the strongest European team in terms of depth, they may find anything less than a two-point lead going into the singles insufficient. In their two victories and one halved match since 1983, Europe entered the last day's singles with a lead, 9-7 in 1985 and 1989, 10% - 5% in 1987. In 1985 Europe widened their lead by winning the singles 7% - 4%. But in 1987 and 1989 the Americans came back strongly in the singles, winning 7% - 4% at Muirfield Vil- lage and 7-5 at The Belfry, thus nar- rowing Europe's victory margin. One bizarre statistic: Woosnam has lost all his singles since he made his first Ryder Cup appear- ance in 1983, and Faldo has won only one since then. The Ocean course at Kiawah Island is so new that the grass was only beginning to grow last April. No tournament has been held there. It has a massive practice ground and calls for a route march of 800 yards from the ninth green to the tenth tee. It was designed by the innovative American Pete Dye to test all aspects of a golfer's game. Dye hates courses that can be over- powered so that competitions on them are won by the best putter. The Ocean course is a classic 'The Americans are fed up with the crowing by the Europeans' links, which means it is built on land that was once under the sea, but any advantage the Europeans might have because of their famil- iarity with such courses has been neutralised by the Americans mak- ing trips to play on it during the spring and summer. What will make a difference how- ever, is the Americans' home advan- tage. Of the 20,000 spectators who have already bought their tickets for each day's play, the vast major- ity will be supporting the home team. At Muirfield Village four years ago knots of American sup- porters self consciously sang silly chants to urge on their men: \"Larry Nelson, you're the man/If you can't do it, no one can.\" Then they waved American flags and giggled. It is not thought that this was a very suc- cessful tactic. It is to the advantage of the Americans that they have an inordi- nate desire to win. They are fed up with the crowing by the Europeans and pay scant regard to the Sony rankings, which place Woosnam, Olazabal, Faldo and Ballesteros ahead of their leading players, Stew- art, Azinger and Couples. It is also to the Americans' advan- tage that there are five newcomers to the competition in Europe's 12. That is a lot of inexperience for Bernard Gallacher to have to deal with and if, as rumour has it, Gal- lacher intends to keep the tried and trusted partnerships of Woosnam and Faldo and Ballesteros and Ola- zabal then several of these newcom- ers may be kept on the sidelines. It may all be decided by how well someone like David Gilford plays on what will be the biggest occasion in his life so far. He is a steady player, whose undemonstrative style of play is in keeping with his charac- ter, and whose ability was rather in doubt until he won an event at The Belfry last month. The night of the third round of that tournament a group of journal- ists began discussing Gilford. The consensus was thait he was not good enough to be in Gallacher's team. He was too self-effacing, diffident and he had not won a tournament. He was a time-server. What he had done was to play in a lot of tourna- ments and compile a succession of solid top-ten finishes. This gave him a handsome income and he invested some of his winnings in buying a farm near Crewe. The ownership of the farm explains his new nick- name, Old McDonald. But so many good finishes and no victories did not suggest that he was a born winner. Personally I did not think he even looked like a champion. He seemed to wear the same scuffed, off-white golf shoes day after day and the turn-ups of his trousers were frayed. The next day he proved us all wrong. In the full beam of publicity, which on the 15th hole meant being scrutinised by a TV crew, a radio commentary team, one dozen pho- tographers, half a dozen journalists, four policemen, two scorers and sundry marshals - and these were the ones allowed inside the ropes - he won his first tournament. Gilford showed real courage that day and may do so again this com- ing week. It is going to be close. I predict there will only be one point in it. What did I put in the sweep- stake? A US victory 14% -13'%.",

   "text_content" : "L AVENHAM in Suffolk is one of., England's most beautiful old towns and the Guildhall of Cor- pus Christi is one of its most important buildings. At the front it faces the market-place but at the back it has a small garden, a recent victim of honey fungus which lives on the roots of trees and shrubs. This fungus is widespread but it is not always fatal. Trees that are otherwise' in good condition are often able to ride out a slight infection. It is only in old age or when they have suffered some other injury or infection that the honey fungus gets the upper hand and the roots are'. completely destroyed by a damp rot that> allows the bark to split away, revealing a cobweb-like growth of white fungal filaments. When that happens, it is essential to get the trunk and as many of the roots as possible removed and burned. There are possible treatments for the soil, including the use of cresols, but they are expensive and smelly. In general it is sufficient to break up the soil thoroughly and then replant, preferably with something less likely to fall victim to honey fungus. That is precisely what they decided to do at Lavenham, except that, as the garden is small and the infection appeared to go right through the soil, it was decided to remove it all, replace with fresh soil, and replant with something completely different. The question was: with what? The ancient prosperity of Lavenham was built on wool, and this old Guildhall now serves in part as a cloth museum. It was suggested that the garden should reflect this interest with plants used to produce the dyes employed by medieval makers of Lavenham wool and broadcloth. I have been to look at the result and Gulidhall adminstrator David Head In th National Truat properly at Lavenham found it so charming that I thought many garden-owners would like to see it for themselves. Lavenham is always worth a visit. Some might even make a dye garden of their own as an alternative or addition to the more usual garden of herbs. At Lavenham, since space is very limited, they have chosen to use only herbaceous plants, crops grown as annuals, and one sub-shrub, Anthemis tinctoria and one small bulb, Crocus sativus, which is the source of the yellow dye, saffron. This is scattered around some of the other plants, notably those that would commonly be regarded as culinary vegetables, namely, beetroot, carrots and onions. Carrots yield dyes giving various shades of yellow and green, and onions produce golden yellow, dark brown, and black dyes. One of the most unfamiliar plants is Actaea spicata, the bane-berry, with clumps of divided spiraea-like leaves and clusters of white flowers, followed by shining, poisonous blackberries, which produce a grey dye. The flowers of Solidago, golden rod, produce a range of yellow dyes and the whole plant a green dye. A short variety, Cloth of Gold, is used at Lavenham. There is also lily-of-the-valley, Convallaria majalis, the leaves of which give a soft yellow dye, and the pink-flowered common soapwort, Saponaria officinalis. The biggest plants in the garden are a single specimen of the New Zealand flax, Phormium tenax, and another, side by side with it, of the cardoon, Cynara cardunculus. This is a relative of the globe artichoke and has large, purple, thistle-like flower-heads and large, divided, silvery-grey leaves. The New Zealand flax has long, strap-shaped, shining leavet and j tall spues of curiously-shaped, dull; maroon flowers and is an exotic-looking iplant that can get damaged in a hard 4winter. In a sheltered garden such as this -it should be entirely safe. It gives a range 4'' of; dyes mostly in shades of brown, but dxtending to apricot. Rubia tinctoria is the madder, a scrambling evergreen British wild plant, with white flowers, followed by black berries, and it needs to be tied to some support, such as a tripod of canes. The colours of its dyes are from pinkish fawn to chestnut red. Isatis tinctoria is also a native, the woad with which ancient Britons used to paint themselves blue. It is a fairly tall biennial with narrowly arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers, followed by little dangling brown pods. It is a member of the great cabbage family. Finally, there are three plants of Baptisia tinctoria, a member of the pea family with three-parted leaves and spikes of yellow flowers. The root and leaves produce dyes in shades of blue, according to the mordant that is used to stabilise them. Other plants could be added to the list; the meadow sweet, Filipendula ulmaria with finely divided leaves and plumy clusters of cream flowers and also the marsh marigold, Caltha palustris, with large, buttercup-like flowers, both of which enjoy moist, even boggy, soils. The Selder, Sambucus niger, is a familiar large shrub with divided leaves and flat clusters of white flowers. Rue, with blue-green pungent leaves and yellow flowers, is such a beautiful plant that I am surprised it does not seem to have been included.

John Richardson describes this as \"... the most innovaitve painting since Giotto...the first unequivocally 20th cen- tury masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern move ment, the cornerstone of 20th century art\". However, he post- pones a full. discussion of it until his next volume (in all there will be four). He does not wish to leave us with the impression that Les Demoi- selles, which he sees as an entirely new beginning, was the culmination of all that he A LIFE OF PICASSO: VOLUME 1 1881-1906 by John Richardson Cape Â£25, 548 pages has described here. Richardson takes us in this volume frogi Picasso's birth in 1881 in M4laga, son of Jos6 Ruiz BlascO, an impoverished painter spdlalising in studies of pigeon,' and his uncom- plaining vfife Maria Picasso Lopez, (as she was), to Pic- asso's pe manent move to Paris in Its early twenties. There, aft r a great deal of hard grindl his work wins rec- ognition ftom one or two dis- criminating collectors and grudginglÂ¶ from dealers. The changing signature on his work, from P. Ruiz Picasso through P. R. Picasso to simply Picasso, say something about his changing attitudes. In repu- diating his patronymic name, to the disgust of his rich uncle who was paying for his studies, Picasso breaks free of his failed father's influence and sides with the less distinguished background of his supportive mhother. Richaidson 'also reminds ,us that macho was invented .in Andulasia. It was somethirg Picasso was born with and never lost. The volume leaves the reader in -no doubt that, even if Picasso were to have died in 1906, he would still be a major figure of modern art. His early work includes the dark ;ca- demic-style religiou 'paintings he executed aa precocou accomplished art-student in Barcelona and Madrid. Then comes the famous blue period with its studies of clowns, acro- bats and harlequins in Paris. A serious affair, started at the age of 15, with an equestrienne instilled in him his love of cir- cus performers. The rose period which followed was full of pictures of the pink torsos of boys, proudly prancing horses and bareback riders. There were countless indi- vidual portraits of people he knew or of classic types Ike La Celestina - the Procuress - a blue period masterpiece that anticipates later work. Whether in a long-deliberated canvas like this or a carica- ture, the person's distinctive traits are seized and held in a cruelly accurate manner. Pic- asso drew most of the people with whom he made contact. It was at Els Quatre Gats, an art- ists' bar in Barcelona, that he found his first peer-group. At 18 his mercurial presence already began to dominate a circle of followers. Some of these went with him to Paris, like the dandified and decadent Carles Casegamas. He committed suicide spectacu- larly by shooting himself in a restaurant while Picasso and others were having dinner. There are several reverbera- tions of this tragic event to be found in Picasso's early work. Then there were portraits of the dealers - the cautious Vol- lard, the honest but poorly-pay- ing Berthe Weill, and a major portrait of his benefactor Ger- trude Stein. In the family circle there were portraits of his par- ents, his sisters (one of whom died young) and many of him- self. We watch him fashioning and re-fashioning his image according to his changing moods, from the cloaked, bearded Byronic homme fatale to the griin aito'ffi\" naked simpleton. Richardson's biography has the confident authority of someone who possesses taste and discernment and who has devoted his whole life to this one great project. Many other, books on Picasso have rÂ· L]C iÂ· -' Â· .f. % ' iÂ· r? : ii\" '''' Â·.; Â·..i- CÂ·~ .Â·, appeared, by scholars, art crit- ics, journalists, discarded wives, old pals, fellow-artists, and band-waggoners of no par- ticular qualification for the task. But despite this avalanche, Richardson has pressed on - not exactly regardless of the other writers, because he acknowledges his debt to some of these, particularly Jaime Sabart6s, Picasso's life-long Spanish secretary. Richardson is however in a class by him- self, better informed and with a wider, perspective than any previous biographer. With unobqtrujsV eruditin, ._be. yslis1 the narrative of the life to the iconography of the work. There is so much richness of content here that admirers of Picasso are strongly recom- mended not to be content with merely reading reviews but to read the volume itself. It has no plates in colour but every- thing Richardson cites is illus- trated in monochrome on the same or next page. The overall impression is to remind one that Picasso was a Spaniard and that, in spite of all his later roles, he remained intensely Spanish at heart. Yet despite this nostalgia for Spain, Picasso ends the book as an artist of the Paris, a French painter origin, and that is will remain. His si cle of French friends i es the poet Max Jacob, who comes into his own here, and Guil- laume Apollinalre,wbo pro- vided a literary counterpart to Picasso's innovative audacity in drawing. The scurrilous inventor of Pbre Ubu, Alfred Jarry, was another kindred spirit. As for his fellow-French painters, Picasso was highly eclectic in his admirations. Matisse was the only contem- porary by whom he felt momentarily threatened. He eschewed such conventional outlets as the Salon and the Salon des Ind6pendents. Rich- ardson cites the work of Stein- len, the caricaturist, as an early influence, and also the arcadian Puvis de Chavannes. Modem masters Picasso came to revere were Van Gogh and Gauguin. Many paintings and draw- ings illustrative of the themes in this book, like the deathbed setpiece Science and Charity, are to be found in the Museo Picasso in Barcelona. Jtkso possesses the Sabartes arcive, which is not to be opened until the year 2018. The family papers, in the Musee Picasso in Paris, are likewise not yet declassified. Has Picasso some surprises still left to spring on us, and for which we will have to wait until the next century?",

   "text_content" : "OTH DAN Jacobson's and J.G. Ballard's new novels might well have been called \"Possession\", if that title had not now been definitively pre-empted. Jacob- son, as ever a meticulously quiet writer, deals with the impossibility of \"possessing\" another, the devastating rip- ples of obsessional love. Bal- lard continues the autobiogra- phy-cum-fiction of his extraordinary Empire of the Sun with a headlong rush from the end of the war until the present day. Compared with Ballard, Jacob- son seems, on first acquain- tance, passionless indeed: but this is to confuse delineation with dissection. Jacobson is, as always, interested in thinking, worriting, ferreting out what a piece of work is man; the mul- ti-layered account of a hopeless love affair and its deadening effects is, as ever, a satisfy- ingly sophisticated essay. Adrian Bester is a young Afrikaner. lawyer living in London, who falls in love with Diana, the wife of pompous Foxborough, poet and BBC functionary. Their affair starts with no preamble: Diana effectively seduces him - and from that moment his obsession is born, his fate is sealed, and he is beyond reach. The main narrative is unfolded gradually by Bester's subsequent lover who, because during his life she was never able to supplant his obsession with Diana, after his death decides to write the story, using her own narrative, Bester's secret diaries, his poems, an interview he did with Foxborough. The narrator believes, from what Bester has told her, that Foxborough was responsible for Diana's death, abandoning her and Bester on a beach as the tide came in. But Jacobson's subtlety is sach that this episode may equally be read as psychological symbolism with powerful literary antecedents. Whe the waves recede Diana has - the obsession has been - but by whoa? Much, much more ground is covered along the way: the question o fate, of how much control we ever have over aurselves, let alone ath the nccesaiblity of other and, by allcakton, how to preserve anch kowee. is tough, serious, deeply alluar tis, as ever, mu~puhlwly rale, but the Od n fin at MW Ehbms ir WbeM Ir ma wu to had me tSk to A B 6 4F a i a which is a tracle of the htngisan Ie -ram with these two novels are now well-known what is the relationship in them between autobiography and \"pure\" fiction (bearing in mind that autobiography always carries fictional baggage).

The latest, Mamiam Bob, is about low life in Florida.

And if Elvin Crowe, who kills without thinking, also goes through life without thinking, Armand is as careful and as methodical as any paid assassin needs to be in cover- ing his tracks. Mr Leonard does not really rate the police. They tend to be as much a part of low life as those they are supposed to detect. They may corrupt, and be corrupted; they are gener- ally not difficult to outsmart, and where they are smart, as in Maximum Bob, they might get their come-uppance any- way. But this is not what marks Blmore Leonard apart. Whether or not he is the Dick- ens of Detroit or the Maupas- sant of Miami, he can write. He has a marvellous ear for dia- logue and for the rhythms and cadences of low life speech. He is also a master of pace. As a Leonard novel moves to a cli- max, not a word is wasted. And he can be funny - best when he lets the humour aimply arise out of the situation (for example, the alligator catchers in MadUmum Bob), perhas less effective (as in Get ShoW ) when he strains a little for eect. Above all, Elmore Leonard is all about realism. Because it is a low life, mostly In Florida and Detroit, that we cannot know about, we must take on trust that he has got it right If he has not, nobody ele has. lJeCk Martia",

Ashton prents him, rightly, a the boisterous Ionoclt whose mind settled to nothing easily, yet whose instincts drove him onward to success as an actor, dramatist, editor, novelist and reviewer. He was an intimate of Carlyle, Trollop ad Thackeray; of ie scientists Spencer and Haxley; and of the psychologistsBal nand Robertson. His writings range from a play written in 13 hours to a fouryear project on the history of philosophy; from biographies of Goethe and Robespierre to \"Sea-Side Studies\" - travels with a microscoe InDevon. He also wrote influential and important books on physiology and psychology. G H LEWES by Rosemary Ashton Clarendon Press,Oxford Â£25. 369 pages But he is still best known as George Eliot's partner. While the Lewes story necessarily becomes the Eliot story after 1851, his early life bunrsts with consequence and detail. He was born in 1817, the third child of his father's second and Illegitimate family. Lewes never refers to his: -., GROenwch school and nevq ^ 'went to i lversity; this aies^ him an anomalous literary Victorian among the likes of Edmund Gosse or Samuel Butler whose youth consisted of familial h borrors and schooltime brutalities. At 16, Lewes was a notary, then a putative merchant, and then an aspiring medic. At 20, he settled to the task of making it in Lomndon literary bohemia. His writing, scattered across the monthlies and in particular the Westminster Review, is sharp, ambitious and wide-ranging. It mirrored the disparate shape of his family life, which was always a distraction from his work. In 1850, his wife left him for his close Mend Thornton Hunt and had four children to add to to the five she had with Lmwes. All but one of Lewes' natural children died In his lifetime he was a decent man who managed to balance his parental and filial dauties later nlife. Lewes lacked judgment as a ournalist.

   "text_content" : "long way th tgabout col- memois Is U ilue'ijomuff nfortunate co s the odish world of-bis musicrather than thel of his earlier . But even those who lost l aence with his work in the I1es, when the gifts of Tippettthe musical inventor seemed to get utterly overwhelmed by the extra-mu- sical messages of Tippett the humanist, will warm to the self-portrait drawn in these pages. Reading Those Twen#- eth-Century Blues one can recover some flavour of the idealism and warmth that seemed so attractive in his cre- ative personality in the first place. In a strict linear sense it is not an autobiography at all, more a series of snapshots from a life which moves for- ward more or less chronologi- cally yet sometimes leapfrogs or loops back discursively. Those searching for new insights into the genesis of the works or the craft of composi- tion will be mostly disap- pointed; Tippett's previous col- lections of essays, Moving into Aquarius and Music of the Angels, will remain the best sources of those. What makes Those Tentieth-Oentury Blues so fascinating, and often very moving, is not just its illumina- tion of a richly patterned life, but the sheer candour of the reminiscences. Any book that opens with the author's memory of his cir- cumcision at the age of five without an anaesthetic is never likely to be dull, but we are also told, whether we needed to know or not, just when and where Tippett lost his virginity (at Fettes College, Edinburgh, aged 15), that he slept just once with Benjamin Britten (at Britten's sugges- tion), but that they didn't have sex. It may all be just a little too upfront at times, yet such honesty makes a healthy con- trast to the suffocating discre- tion that still surrounds Brit- ten's personal life, a composer whose emotional range was cir- cumscribed by his homosexual- ity, incidentally, in a way that Tippett's has never been. There is an element about these IeÃ½ssions., to, of set- e record stright not just for posterity (though an ego certainly has to be fed and soothed) but also, one senses, for Tippett's own sake. Re-ex- amining some of the friend- ships of his 86 years has quite dearly been a painful process. But in dissecting the uneasy ette motejr, Odisntangling himuself froc the successon of upper middle-class women who wanted to bear his children, and in dchro ling the relation- ablps that just ell apart, the tone raiely ate. For tat much credit must go to Mel- rion Bowen, whose conversa- tions with Tippett formed the bisis of the book. The helplessness that some- times overwhelmed his politi- cal and private life is well caught too. His flirtation with Communism in the 1930s, which ended when details of the terrors of Stalinism became known, cost him some close friendships, and his politics ever since have been broadly socialist without close party links. And the suicide in 1945 of Francesca Allinson, his clos- est confidante, is the book's darkest moment: \"Perhaps my career especially got in the THOSE TWENTIETH-CENTURY BLUES: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Michael Tippett Hutchinson Â£16.99, 290 pages way & she is part of the price,\" he wrote afterwards. \"...One is exclusively selfish whether over life or death. We can't accept anything or venture anything with grace.\" But the travelogues lift the spirit - shoe-string forays into Europe during the 1920s, grand world tours in the '70s and '80s when his music at last began to find an audience overseas, all of them are graced with Tippett's ageless capacity for wonder. There are extended sequences of letters also, to Francesca Allinson and others in the 1940s (some sent from Woodward Scrubs, while Tip- pett was serving his three- month sentence as a conscien- tious objector) and to Meirion Bowen in the 1970s and a large chunk of a dream diary, com- plete with interpretations, from the 1930s when he was undergoing formal Jungian ysis. The mixture sounds, like, so much ofthe music, an overrich one. It is allggibe an adin ble book, thoi, by nob meahns perfetlyt'' popor- tioned aid not without its flat- nesses, but touchingly honest and endearing. Andrew Clements",

These days \"real history\" is done with masses of anecdotes in books 1,000 pages long. Paul John- son's latest tome on world sod- ety in the 15 years after the Battle of Waterloo is yet another fruit of the gigantic genre, published in time to fall through the bottom of 10,000 Anglo-American Christmas stockings. It is an impressive work In more than bulk. In mature and meticulous style, Johnson draws the arts, science, litera- ture and politics together in a compelling narrative of the post-1815 era. The book is a succession ot brilliantly drawn cameos, infusing life into everything from the Cn of Vienna to Davey's safty lamp and the Regency pen- chant for body-matchg.

Eight of the 12 chapte are more or less oancerned with Britain and the US, and the perversity of put- ting the growth of a special relationhip between the two before all else must have more to do with sales than sense.

   "text_content" : "Interior design is turning away from the frilly, chintzy country mode to a sturdy, ethnic look. Lucia van der Post describes the new style F OR YEARS the mood in interior and house design seems hardly to change. There are shifts of tone and emphasis but by and large the prevailing tastes stay much the same. Then something seems to hap- pen. Some subterranean force seems to be at work causing fabric designers, furniture makers, paint makers and all the ancillary trades and manu- facturers involved in the con- struction of the modish inte- rior to shift in the same direction. The 1980s saw a long period when the English country house look remained the dream. In cottages and subur- ban villas in metropolitan flats and city terraces, there were swags and faded chintzes, bowls of pot-pourri and dried flowers. As the 1980s drew to a close the modish interior became more and more opu- lent, pattern piled on pattern, artefact on artefact. For some time there have been signs of a growing con- sensus that enough was enough: if we saw another swag or frill or chintz we just might scream. What, though, was the alter- native? Well, as I've said before, among the cognoscente there has been a feeling that a stronger, simpler look was on the way in. Sturdy pieces of country furniture, cottons instead of silks and satins, sim- ple wrought-iron curtain rails instead of swags and frills, wooden floors covered with rugs or hessian instead of plush carpets. Running side by side is a feeling for the ethnic - all strong shapes and interesting textures. Habitat is running a big campaign emphasising its autumn ethnic mood. In shops up and down the UK there are earthy colours and geometri- cally patterned ceramics and fabrics. Global Village is currently expanding and riding high on the new mood and just a few weeks ago opened its first shop in London, a glossy emporium at 247-249 Fulham Road, London SW3. Started in the mid-70s by Victor Lamont, a Methodist minister who believed that trade not aid was the way to self-sufficiency for underdevel- oped countries, it specialises in an interesting combination of the ethnic and the sophisti- cated. Lamont seems to have the knack of persuading the crafts people all over the world to keep the interesting charac- ter but dispense with the folksy clumsiness. He has mas- tered the art of making the eth- nic work with modern urban environments. Furniture and artefacts come from 40 different countries. Some are bought just as they are found but many are the result of a close collaboration between the company and the craftsmen. Those who tend to shudder at the very word ethnic should make a point of visiting a Global Village shop. There they will find rattan in ver- sions sophisticated enough to work in a London drawing- room. There are metal and cane chairs that make elegant dining-chairs. Then there are twirly hand-forged metal pieces, sturdy teak, some colo- nial-style mahogany and rattan chairs and what looks like a range of gentle English newly \"distressed\" country pieces. The newest line is some furni- ture from New Mexico, hand- painted by Navajo Indians. It is already discovered by many of the world's top design- ers - Ralph Lauren has used it in his catalogue, Andrde Put- man chose some for the Bor- deaux Museum of Art. Besides the furniture there is a whole host of authentic accessories, many of which are one-off individual pieces - things like Indian jewellery, Indonesian puppets, monumen- tal wood carvings and papier michd animals. Prices, which once upon a time struck one as being so reasonable, alas, seem to have risen but then, to be fair, so has the sophistication of the products. Besides the new London shop there is still the very first shop in South Petherton, Som- erset and branches in Bath, Bristol, Dublin, Exeter, Raven- sthorpe in Northumberland and Sherborne in Dorset. There is also a glossy mail order cata- logue from which the furniture can be ordered and which costs Â£3, refundable with the first order. Write to Global Village Crafts Limited, Sparrow Works, Bower Hinton, Mar- tock, Somerset TA12 6 LG. If ethnic is not your style then perhaps New England is. New England has many of the attractive qualities of Shaker- style and is inspired, quite clearly, by the same dislike of ostentation, the same love of simplicity and quality. Rhode Design is a small com- pany based in London's East End which has started to pro- duce a collection inspired by the simple lines of early 19th century American craft furni- ture. Made from MDS (medium density fibreboard) and sos- twoods, it is tough and stable and it is turned into furniture of simple practicality. Every piece is useful, every piece has plain but pleasing lines. There are dressers, tops and bookcases, chests and small wall cupboards, side- boards and hanging shelves.

   "text_content" : "N MUCH of Japanese art we can sense how aesthetic contemplation has shaped both form and expressive means. The flo and weight of the brushe-stte in painting or calligraphy;'tbe rilgorius Ulne of a pot; even the abstraction of laidscape land figures in a print, all tell bs a coincern with an essential identity through concentration of experience. Just so in Noh theatre, where the masks worn by the principal actors are the out- ward signs of a spiritual truth. With Noh, we have to acknowl- edge seven centuries of tradi- tion that have refined and styl- ised the natre of the players and their texts. There results drama at once intensely pure and dense with the weight of its own wisdom. Watching the illustrious Umewaka tiupe on Thursday night, at ttl opening of their brief season'at the Queen Eliz- abeth Hall, found myself won- dering not at the infinite strangeness'of the style - with its whooping and gargling vocalists, its absolUtely other time scale, its arcane rituals - but at the communicative powereof ich incident, each monmet. where nothing seems to haipen, everything happens, as stillness-reveals the heart of the drama Where dimensions of activit are circumscribed by cent es of performance, and ve eaning can be lost even; to apanese listeners, there ivyc established a world of tet and often fero- ci b iour, whose force rriigly home. You , I eve, to surrender to N ; on that decision -is taken, then you remain its grateful prisoner for life. The Umewaka troupe's first programme contains the by now usual two Noh dramas separated by a Kyogen farce. Both plays deal with the super- niatural - as do many such texts - and the world of demons and ghosts gains in terror through the conventions of the style. In The Burden of Love, an old gardener, the Shite (principal) role, falls in love with a court lady. She rejects 'V Seven centuries of Japanese tradition: Maklo Umewaka at the Queen Elizabeth Hall Alatair Mulr ~Si~ .. .,.,: .. i:: him, testing him by asking him to lift a heavy burden. He dies, and his reproachful ghost taxes the lady with her cruelty before forgiving her. On the bare wood of the Noh stage, with its painted pine tree, the story unfolds as masks, gorgeous costumes, the guiding rhythms of drum and vocalising, lead us into the cen- tral fact of the Shite perfor- mance. In this Yasutoshi Urata is tremendous: dignified as the despairing gardener, and then accusing as the ghost, his mask an abstraction of anger and grief, white maned, white robed. It is theatre where every least action, each slow posi- tioning of the body or the robes, acquires penetrating meaning. In The Lady Aoi, the evil spirit of a Prince's discarded mistress attacks a court lady (who is represented simply by a robe folded on the stage). Exorcised by a priest, the spirit assumes its true form as a demon, and is finally vanquished. This Shite role is a bravura one, and Makio Umewaka endows it with extraordinary menace as well as extraordinary beauty of style. The appearance of the demon - in horned and horrid mask, a white robe over trailing red trousers - seems the most vivid incarnation of evil, and the grandeur and force of Mr Umewaka's presence speak of great acting. In both his and Mr Urata's performances, the final moments of pure, austere movement - the summation of the spirit of the piece as the Shite stamps and turns - are very fine indeed. The Kyogen farce is a wild incident between an itinerant doctor and the thunder god who demands medical attention, and it is played with earthy humour and impeccable timing by Senzaburo Shigeyama and Shingo Shigeyama. The Umewaka troupe is presenting two programmes, and the company tours for the next two weeks. It should not be missed by anyone interested in theatre at its purest and most beautiful.

   "text_content" : "HE NASH Ensemble's London series has decamped to the Purcell Room while the Wigmore Hall is renovated; the first phase of its 20th-century music series, sponsored by IBM, packs a quartet of concerts into ten days. There is a healthy ration of premieres, and nearly new British music; on Thursday the Nash introduced Robin Hollo- way's Summer Music Concer- tino No 5, a sextet for flute, clarinet and strings. The piece is not, says Hollo- way, a reflection of the pleas- anter aspects of summer; it emphasises more the \"mosqui- toes and thistles, prickly heat and headachy closeness.\" Yet it seems altogether a fairly cheerful piece; a busy single movement, with the hint of a slower, reflective section two- thirds way through (nearest point to a pastoral idyll), and sharply characterised solos for the two woodwind. The piece is dedicated to Alexander and Amira Goehr, who are, the composer claims, \"to some extent portrayed by the two soloists\". That added a further level of intrigue to what is a rewarding, carefully knitted argument: which was the serene, lyrical oboe and which the unpredictable, astringent clarinet? I know where I would put my money. Andrew Clements On Thursday the latest Lon- don Symphony Orchestra sea- son at the Barbican was launched by its chief conduc- tor, Michael Tilson Thomas, in characteristically lively fash- ion - with two new works, and then the Eroica Symphony. The first, not strictly a premi- ere, was the concert suite that Tilson Thomas has himself drawn from the 1983 Leonard Bernstein opera A Quiet Place. The opera, a vibrantly origi- nal piece of 1980s suburban lyr- ic-drama which I long to see staged in this country, is not ideally represented in the suite, which seems to favour Bernstein's edgy, brass-and- percussive soundworld at the expense of his wrily lyrical abundance. Still, the work's peculiar strength and contem- porary-flavoured intensity was energetically delivered. I can summon a less whole- hearted welcome for the \"real\" piece of new music: John Tave- ner's Dance Lament of the Repentant Thief, a Shell-LSO commission. For the orches- tra's first clarinetist, Andrew Marriner, a superlative virtu- oso, Tavener has produced a rondo on Greek folk-dance themes, with fast and slow sec- tions artfully alternated, clari- net arabesques looping, drones long-held and bells jingling above the string orchestra. It's a piece of very pale charm, and limited powers of invention somewhat over- stretched; but the real puzzle- ment is the religious inspira- tion lying behind it. As ever in a recent Tavener composition, the music is supposedly replete with Christian mystical assotl- ations; but my ears found it impossible to link them to this mild sample of musical travel- gue. I ust don't get it. Max Loprt",

   "text_content" : "SANJEL Mon's new jI hettSotteslie, Is fa of initia promsie Although-it seems a good five 'ininutes before anyone speak, the uild-u I of ablie menace. The characters are articulate, in the sense that they speak decent English. You expect that something sinister is going to happen, and wonder what. You also wonder where. Since Mornin is a young northern Irish playwright, Ulster and the troubles are never far out of mind. The set- ting, however, hints nmote of Africa. Here is a remote house \"in the middle of nowhere\": it looks hot, there is talk of mountains in the background and you suspect that the natives might be getting rest- less, except that there aren't any natives. So far, so good. The head of the department, spoken of as a very powerful man, is coming to visit: thus the intimation of colonial Africa still holds. It is perfectly reasonable theatrical licence to suggest that there might be some parallels between the British in Africa and direct rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA and Sinn Fein believe that there are. Therte is also the possibility that. the* unfolding drama might be personil, not politi- cal. Walter, the head of the deprttment, escaped from somtewhere with Richard, the father in toe house, years ago. A dmirably play&d by Stephen oxe, Walter has a way with women as well as the bottle. The odds are that, while paus- ing to look at the young daugh- ter en route, he,will fall for Richard's wife, Anna, who even her husband recognises is bored stiff out in the wilds. The intermittent music becomes more insistent, the drinks flow, the mutual attrac- tion between Walter and Anna seems to grow. Although the pauses are derivative, the promise remains. Something dramatic is about to take place, and we are still guessing. This is just over half-way through a play that lasts less than two hours. Then suddenly it all goes horribly, stupidly wrong. These are not images of Africa imposed on the Irish question at all. Instead off we go into the holocaust, racial purity, storm-troopers, the Jewish sci- entist who has contributed to the missile programme without questioning what it is for. Sym- bolism and subtlety give way to a cruder vision, and with it the human drama disappears as well. This is the silliest anti-cli- max after an enticing begin- ning that I have seen for a very long time. It is a great pity because Mornin is plainly a playwright of some talent. Watch the uneasy relation- ships early on, the way one character might laugh while the other remains silent, only for the roles to be quickly reversed. Note the beautiful performance by Cathryn Har- rison as the wife, nervous about her husband and the arrival of his old fribnd. See how even the heavy-drinking Walter puts on his jacket and does up his tie for dinner, while Nicholas Woodeson, the husband, is in his best dou- ble-breasted suit. All that is excellent and pre- cisely directed by Jenny Kil- lick. Yet it is Mornin who blows his own play in the end. Like the IRA, he does not know how to stop, but he should not be deterred from trying again. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "F THE traffic should come to a temporary halt tonight in the Euston Road outside the Shaw Theatre it will proba- bly not be the police siren or the fire appliances but the sound of Kim Criswell in her one-woman song-fest, Doin' What Comes Naturally. This lady has the loudest wail in the business. Decibel for decibel even Liza Minnelli would be in difficulties trying to top her when she is at full stretch. In her hands a portable mike seems a redundant bauble. With solo accompaniment on the piano from her musical director Kevin Farrell, she devoted her first half to golden oldie standards by Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers and Irving Berlin from shows like Any- thing Goes, Annie Get Your Gun and South Pacific. Cri- swell has just released an album with EMI of Annie which I do not have but I do possess the earlier one of Anthying Goes (CDC 7 498482). As Reno Sweeney there she sounds so much better than she did last night. Perhaps it is something to do with having John McGlinn conducting and the LSO to contend with. It dulls the stridency in her ren- derings all too apparent live at the Shaw. One plus is her articulation. Kim crswei: in me voonteps of Merman However big the sound you can always hear the words very clearly. In Cole Porter this only serves to show how weak and dated many of them are now; unlike the rhythms which are as magical as ever. Still, \"Always True to You in My Fashion\" from Kiss Me Kate induced its customary frisson. \"Blow Gabriel, Blow\" a num- ber simply made for Criswell (as her recording of it proves), and where the words hardly matter, was listed as the first- half closer but in the event not given. A pity. The cosy asides to the audi- ence in between the songs revealed a likeable \"tough cookie\" show-biz personality and there was briefly evidence of dancing skills including tap (like everyone else Criswell has played in Cats). Also a gift for vocal comedy which surely could be developed in future editions of this show. The sec- ond half where, after a cos- tume change, she is backed by a quartet including bass guitar (Martin Elliott), syhthesiser (Peter Lee) and drums (Harold Fisher) was devoted mainly to music in a more contemporary mode with a spirited go at Sondheim's \"Move On\" from George. This set was the more successful with greater variety of attack. Perhaps it is with Sondheim material the future lies. Following as she is so devotedly in EBtb*Merments- Broadway footsteps, Criswell seems about ready now to play Rose in Gypsy, giving the role the full resonance it requires, preferably in .at- auditorium like the Olivier where the walls are made of reinforced concrete.

   "text_content" : "P OPULARLY the word \"decadent\" connotes something like shame- less opulence - per- haps tacky - and lubricious perversity. The epithet \"fin de sibcle\" goes along with it, and so does the period-word \"neur- asthenic\" (think of the hypo- chondriac son in Budden- brooks). \"Camp\" is different, for it implies a knowing irony that would subvert whole- hearted decadence: that's why Wilde's Salome, for example, is artful camp, whereas Richard Strauss made a \"decadent\" opera of it by ignoring the ironic undertones of the text. A new \"Opera Rara\" recording from Marco Polo (8.223328-330, three CDs with full text) revives what may be the most decadent opera ever composed, Franz Schreker's Die Gezei- chneten. In fact Schreker had hesi- tated over completing his first opera, Der ferne Klang, until Strauss's Salome (1905) proved that a scandalous success could still be a success. Reas- sured, he brought out Derferne Klang with much iclat; the premiere of Die Gezeichneten, which he began before the Great War, made a great impression in 1918, and he fol- lowed it up swiftly with Der Schatzgrber (1920). The latter, I think, represents an irrevers- ible decline into operatic rou- tine, despite his ever-seductive orchestration - but with the current CD rediscovery of Schreker you can decide for yourself: there is a Schatzgrd- ber on Capriccio, and a Feme Klang on Marco Polo. Like his contemporaries Zemlinsky, Pfitzner and Franz Schmidt, he composed much- admired operas on distinctly decadent libretti, which failed to travel beyond Austro-Ger- man audiences. Though young Korngold was luckier for a few years after the War, he soon dropped into his natural place in Hollywood film-music; only old Strauss went triumphantly international. Strauss often capitalised on scandal (his Feuersnot, Salome, Elektra and Rosenkavalier all gained hugely from their improper, even \"indecent\" sea- tures), but. generally his shock- values declined with time into mere play-money. What was disturbing in Schreker was deadly serious, and is still quite unsettling. The effect is enhanced by the insidious shot-silk allure of the Schreker sound - lovingly imitated by Berg, especially in his \"deca- dent\" Lulu, and gorgeously captured in this Gezeichneten by Edo de Waart and the Dutch Radio Philharmonic. The three main Schreker operas, all to his own texts, share the same ground-plan: there is a high-minded Artist figure (close cousin to the com- poser), and an Idealised Woman who descends relent- lessly into prostitution or worse by her own fated choice, and a bitter ending. Even where the trappings are mythi- cal-stagey, as in his first and third operas, Schreker aims at 20th-century psychological nat- uralism - disillusioned, post- Freudian, close to the bone. The trappings of Die Gezei- chneten belong to fin de siecle pornography. Its \"hero\" Alvi- ano, a Genovese noble and a hunchbacked aesthete, has built an island Elysium (imag- ine ddcor by Odilon Redon, dresses by Klimt) where young aristocrats hold their orgies - without poor Alviano, unmanned by self-loathing - and abduct girls of any station for their purposes, sometimes fatal Alviano falls in love with another masochist, the fey painter Carlotta, when she dis- cerns his beautiful spirit, but she soon finds that the macho rapist Tamare is what she really wants. Wheh the police and horrified townsfolk close in, it all ends amid gore and madness. It is hard to imagine how this crazy piece could be staged now without ruinous laughs, Yet Schreker's score maintains an extraordinary, obsessive intensity, seething and cajoling and exulting. Fewer \"tunes\" than Strauss, but potent thematic material; and if William Cochran's Alvi- ano, good in declamation, has a nasty beat in higher and longer notes (Schreker surely expec- ted a less baritonal timbre), Sigmund Cowan's Tamare and the authority-figures of Charles van Tassel and Wout Ooster- kamp are excellent. Still better is the Carlotta of Marilyn Schmiege, a fine dramatic mezzo with a brave upper extension and acute intelli- gence. She is new to me, but undoubtedly we shall hear much more of her. Hans Werner Henze's The Bassarids, to an Auden-Kall- man text after Euripides' Bac- chae, has long awaited a recording in the original English. The Berlin perfor- mance on Schwann/Koch (314 006 K3, two CDs) is five years old, but it does the opera proud - granted the omission of the mock-Restoration Intermezzo, which was always controver- sial. That's the \"lubricious per- versity\" bit, representing the secret erotic fantasies of the young, austerely chaste King Pentheus, later slain by his mother Agave when he is driven to spy upon the Bac- chantes' rites in female dis- guise. At least the Koch album-text might have printed that scene, but it doesn't. Worse, the print- ers have missed out the page which includes Pentheus's final monologue of raw self-revelation. Andreas Schmidt delivers it well in the recording, however, in his piquant German-American- British accents. Most of his col- leagues, all excellent, are unambiguously American or British: Kenneth Riegel's seductive Dionysus, Karan Armstrong's penetrating Agave and Celia Lindsley as her sister Autonoe .among .the former, Robert Tear's Tiresias and Michael Burt's Cadmus among the latter. Gerd Albrecht conducts the Berlin Radio Symphony with tense sympathy, and the RIAS and Silddeutscher Rundfunk cho- ruses are alert and nearly always in tune. The up-to-date \"decadence\" of this opera lies in its double focus. On the one hand, the ghastly events of the original play are presented soberly, as if from a dispassionate dis- tance (even the Bacchantes' feral assault has a cool, ethe- real glitter). On the other, where Dionysus and the repressed Pentheus are most concerned, the nudging mod- ern sub-text is about homo- erotic discovery; for that, the grave tenderness in Henze's music outweighs the overt vio- lence elsewhere. In this respect, the opera has an unlikely twin in Szymanows- ki's King Roger. Did Henze ever think of that? Postscript: the abstractly \"decadent\" Szymanowski of the virtuoso piano is captured with sensitive expertise by Dennis Lee on Hyperion CDA 66409, from the op. 4 Etudes to the op. 34, Masques. On Schwann/Koch 311 064 HI, Szy- manowski's \"ballet-grotesque\" Mandragora sounds archly sub-Pulcinella, but Robert Satanowski and his Polish National Opera forces carry off the later, non-decadent Harm- sie ballet with an exhilarating swing.

   "text_content" : "J APAN WITHOUT the financial scandals and sex-comics. Japan with- out plastic food, paddy- fields or kimoneos. No raked gravel gardens and no geriatric settlements on the coast of West Africa. Most of us have mental cup- boards full of facts, cliches and fancies about Japan. Lock up that cupboard before visiting Visions of Japan, which runs at the Victoria and Albert Museum until January 5. This highly unconventional show offers a chic, desiger-cut key to understanding Japan. With next to nothing for the visitor to read, this is an exhi- bition for illiterates. There is an obvious irony in presenting modern Japan, world-leader in information technology, in a manner which is so uninforma- tive. In the first room a hearse, Japan-style with its gilded tem- ple-like chassis, crashes into a traditional screen of wood and paper. A cue for a commentary on death-rituals and ancestor- worship, you might think? Not a bit of it. If you marry a Japa- nese, a jar holding your in- laws' ashes will very likely end up in the parlour. But for all that stuff, go to the section on religion in the plethora of \"understanding Japan\" books. At the V&A, signs and symbols rule. This is an amazingly coura- geous show and I would love to know what its Japanese busi- ness sponsors, who contributed Â£4m, think about it. It was brave of the organisers not to embark on a route-march through Japanese history and culture. It was brave to root the show in contemporary pop- ular culture. High-tec con- sumer products are, after all, the aspect of Japan most bor- ingly familiar and accessible to us all - and the one which most threatens our ideas of the traditional excellences of Japan. Above all, it was brave to make a show so lacking in complacency. As pure specta- cle, this show with its fibre-op- tics, its liquid crystal projec- tors, its pervasive electronic hum, is a tribute to industria- lised Japan. But the rare explicit texts say something different. What, after all, have the Japanese gained in the journey from Buddhist cosmos to urban chaos? This show is an excursion into Japanese angst. Visions of Japan is some- thing very novel. It is not curated by museum types but proceeds from the brains of architects - above all, it appears, from the super-sophis- ticated mind of Arata Isozaki. Japan's leading architect is an RIBA Gold Medallist (not that he has built anything here), the architect for the Barcelona Olympics, and a superman of the jet-set avant-garde. Isozaki dreamed up this outrageously, gloriously, undidactic show. Then, like the guru of some new sect, he retreated, leaving his gnomic pronouncements to three younger followers to vis- ualise. The result is pure spectacle and sensation, at least if you take the easy route. And yet the carnival-float rides on a clanking undercarriage of fash- ionable post-modern discourse. It is well worth reading the essays, above all the one by Isozaki, even though the book of the show costs Â£25(designed by Kijuro Yahagi, one of Japan's top graphic designers.) Patricia Morison applauds a brave and highly unconventional show at the V&A Without the sacred text, the exhibition comes across as fun but pretty well unintelligible. Isozaki looked for the key to understanding Japanese soci- ety, something which, as he observes with a touch of cyni- cism, would be simple enough to make a newspaper headline. Like other commentators, he noted that in Japan there is an absence of guiding principles or values in Japan. There is a void at the heart. So what makes it all tick? Japanese culture is about playing games. \"All that mat- ters is the rules. The ultimate pleasure is to respect, follow, and become absorbed in these games.\" Play and games have a frivolous, childlike sense to our ears, unless we think back to the Edwardian public-school gentleman's idea of \"playing the game\". Is the core theme of the show. really a valid way to understand Japan? I floated Isozaki's game-theory across Timothy Screech, lecturer in Japanese Art at the London's School of Oriental and African Studies. Yes, he confirms, Isozaki has a good and novel point. Asobi, the Japanese for \"play\", means neither a childish activity, nor sport, but something more seri- ous. It is a kind of solemn let- ting off steam which even encompasses writing novels and poems. In the 18th-century, artists who turned to making down-market Ukiyoe wood- block prints were, in a sense, playing. Some will regret that Isozaki's ingenious blueprint was not followed in full. As he points out, with game-playing goes an obsession with \"man- neristic repetition\". The 48 rules of sumo wrestling will be coming to London as part of the Japan Festival - but not the 48 ways to enjoy sex. \"Pay up [Â£5 for adults] and play the game\" is, then, the motto of the show. The triple vision unrolls through three rooms called Cosmos, Chaos and Dreams, corresponding to past, present and future - or in Isozaki's sharper-toned text, the realms of cliche, kitsch and simulation. Present and future turn out to be pretty much the same, an urban nightmare of people enslaved to simulated, electronic experience. Are peo- ple doomed to become androids? asks Toyo Ito, designer of the final, vertigo-in- ducing room where constantly shifting images of commuter hordes float over walls and floor. Tokyo, it is suggested, is an android hell, which is rather comic considering that the V&A's influential show in 1980, Japan Style, set out to dispel clichds, in particular \"a wide- spread visual stereo- type ... namely that Japan is an undifferentiated megalopoli- tan hell...\" Visions of Japan belongs dead-centre within the post-modern debate about the future of cities, and it hints at a thumbs down. The monster Godzilla broods over a model of a city which is blackened and half-destroyed, its base-board a jigsaw of electronic circuit- boxes. Lock up your mental cupboard of clich6s before visiting Isozakl's thought provoking exhbtlon Most obviously, the theme of playing games dominates Chaos, the most talked-up sec- tion of the show designed by Osamu Ishiyama. However, it would be wise to take the hype with a dash of soy-sauce. Here are computer games, a karaoke booth, food-and-drink vending machines (which do not work, to avoid licensing and litter problems), and massage chairs which pummel your vertebrae - assuming you can get any- where near for the queues. This is somewhere to take small children for a guaranteed non-boring museological expe- rience. Their teenage siblings may well have seen it all before. This kind of mindless electronic madness is perfectly familiar to anyone who hangs around Leicester Square in trainers. However, the Chaos room really does evoke a walk through a Japanese street. The cacophony is in fact rather muted, and so too the smells. However, the massed display of gawdy signs and banners is very effective at pricking the memory. The Japanese use three indigenous scripts, plus Roman in advertising, and walking into any department store is like a bombardment of graphics. Cleverly, too, Ishi- yama shows how old and new amicably co-exist. Here are the Shinto gods of good fortune, prehistoric survivals now made out of plastic, who can be found outside any restaurant. Brave, complex, and exceed- ingly cerebral, this is an exhi- bition which will linger in the mind. It leaves out so much precisely because it has refused to go for the fiction that a culture can be neatly packaged, like a Japanese lun- cheon-box. It is not ostensibly about beauty, or haiku, or the chrysanthemum and the sword. But it is also about all of these things. Isozaki's game is to take the visitor into the great game which is Japan.",

   "text_content" : "OR ME, the new-look Radio 4 began unhap- pily. Sir John Gielgud's reading of Genesis on Monday acquired an unnecessary intro- duction about the Old Testa- ment, and, worse, incidental music. The reading was of course superb, even though there was a mistaken word in Chapter 4, verse 7. The old-look Radio 4 went out well with the first of 10 parts of David Copperfield. We have not yet met the adult David, save as commentator, but we are leaping through the tale in Betty Davies's adapta- tion (director, Marilyn Imrie), from a cross Betsy Trotwood, a pathetic Mrs Copperfield, a sin- ister Murdstone, a threatening Creakle, happiness with the Peggottys at Yarmouth, friend- ships with Traddles and Steer- forth at school Too soon yet to venture on a criticism, but there are nine weeks to go. I shall love it. As a sort of footnote, Radio 4 gave a half-hour play on Tues- day, Emma Micawber. Dilys Faye told us about her devo- tion to Wilkins Micawber, whose faults, authentic Dick- ens, she always overlooked, leaving us half sympathetic, half scornful. But Raymund FitUSimons's writing contained nothing new, and Micawber is not in the Saturday serial yet. Last Saturday, two hours of Global Zoo on Radio 4 assessed the relative prospects of man and wildlife, the second hour being a phone-in discussion that I didn't hear, having already been given enough to think about. Colin Tudge and George Monbiot reported from Africa, India and Brazil on the degree to which man's activi- ties have conflicted with those of the native creatures. Some examples leave me regretful but no more; it cannot matter much to the world if the Suma- tran tiger dies out. But many species live useful lives, and if they are elimi- nated other species may become a menace. The pro- gramme was not sentimental. One of its points was to show how man's selfish activities may destroy other cultures. In Tanzania great areas of tribal land have been taken over to grow wheat; much wildlife is gone, a lake is silting up. At another level, when the Masai were evicted from their tradi- tional country, there was over- grazing elsewhere, to the dam- age of the vegetation; in the Rift Valley too much cultiva tion has destroyed much of the natural growth. The behaviour of the Brazilian ranchers to the natives and the forest is already notorious. As an Oxfam speaker said, man has a natural tendency to breed, but education may stop too much reproduction. Ideally each family should live on its own land. Yet the programme was less about man than about the other creatures. The situa- tion is arising in which species may only survive in protected parks, making the world a \"global zoo\". We visited a lab where genetic embryos were preserved in liquid nitrogen lest they should be lost in nature - a ghastly warning. Radio 4 replied, partly, on Wednesday with its What Prse Elephants? Zimbabwe's ban- ning of elephant hunting (and poaching) means that the beasts often destroy farmers' crops. Operation Campfire has devised a scheme where game scouts keep the elephants off, and are allowed one elephant each. This pleases the tribes- men, whose crops are protected and who profit from the ele- phants' ivory and meat. Visit- ing hunters are taken on as game scouts. The area now maintains a normal wildlife, the tribesmen are better off, t there is sport for the hunters. A Public Attitude Survey poll has brought manners into general talk, and Nigel Rees on Radio 4 is presenting six Best i Behaviour programmes on such questions as what is cor- rect, and who cares? Inter- i views with the experienced, or i expert, or both, established r that the old cared more than i the young. There was no una- i nimity about opening doors for women, about smoking at meals, even about putting i young men and women guests I into adjoining rooms. With five I programmes to come, we may i settle such things. Myself, I i need to learn the etiquette of i eating a scone served with foil- i wrapped butter and jam in a plastic box. B.A. Young",

   "text_content" : "THE ANNUAL Lloyds Bank International Open encourages young players. Several British grandmasters gained valuable early experience there as teen- agers. A Junior international is incorporated in the open. This year's top three were Alexei Shirov and Michael Adams, the highest rated juniors in the world, and fya Gurevich, the world under-20 champion. It was a much younger boy who attracted the spectators. Peter Leko, 11, of Hungary, has already been near to an IM norm and beaten the world champion microcomputer. His Fide rating of 2,385, equal to a 223 British grade, is a record for his age. At Lloyds Bank he drew with the runner-up, Alex Shabalov of Latvia. Since the Polgar sisters showed that you can coach GMs almost from infancy, chess precocity has become fashionable. All three medal- lists in the world under-10 championship at Warsaw have quit school and turned profes- sional. It may yet end in tears. Chess has fewer sponsors due to the recession, while interna- tional opens are vastly more competitive with busloads of hungry east Europeans (A Shi- rov, Latvia, White; P Leko, Hungary, Black; Grunfeld Defence; Lloyds Bank 1991). 1 d4 Ns6 2 c4 g6 3 NcS d5 4 Bg5 Ne4 5 Bs4 Nxc3 6 bxcS dxc4 7 e4 c5 8 Bxc4 Bg7 9 Ne2 Nc6 10 d5 Na5 11 Bd3 0-0 12 18 0.0 e5 14 c4 b6 15 B Nb7 16 4 Bd7 17 a5 NdG 18 Ne3 f549 Bel ft.20 Qb8 h5?

Declarer made his contract with an overtrick. In room two North did not show his worthless heart suit, but showed where his strength lay by the reply of two clubs, South rebid two diamonds, North jumped to four spades, and South went on to six. West led the spade knave, and the declarer took stock. With two diamonds to be ruffed, it appeared that an even break in trumps must be assumed, but the declarer had other ideas. Taking the spade knave in dummy - this is essential - South ruffed a heart in hand, cashed ace and king of diamonds, and ruffed a diamond with the spade seven, West throwing a club,and a third heart was ruffed. In the five-card ending South cashed ace and king of clubs, ruffed one more heart with his eight of spades, and his ace of trumps was good for the 12th trick. A well timed coup en passant. In my opinion, when South reaches the five-card ending,he should cash the ace of spades, discarding dummy's club seven, - spades might have been 2-2 - and then cross to the club king to ruff a heart. This method would have been essential, if West had thrown a heart instead of a club on the fourth diamond. South ruffs a fourth heart, and West can overruff, but now he must put dummy in with a club to score the last two tricks. E.P.C Cotter",

She has outstanding legs,\" her female aide-de-camp told me, rummag- ing in her executive briefcase for a snapshot. \"You don't mind, do you, Marie?\" the ADC added. \"No, I don't mind,\" replied the presi- dent, looking as coy as a kitten. I was handed a photograph of a laughing, matronly Europa astride a monstrous stuffed bull, her flouncy pet- ticoats ruckled up to mid-thigh. The two women waited expectantly. Yes, I agreed, spluttering with English embarrassment, you certainly have, er, got good legs. \"There, you see!\" Mrs Eldred Martin Yochim (DAR offi- cers use their husbands' names, but I shall call her Marie), nee Hirst, from Falls Church, Virginia, is head of that intimidating regiment of women which fights with banners, medals, bunting and booklets for patriotism and the American way. She had marched across the hotel lobby to meet me, dressed in brilliant, Tory blue and decorated with the golden badges of her office. While we talked she sat ramrod straight, almost immobile, as if afraid of creasing the presidential sash across her bosom. It was easy to imagine her on the platform of a convention hall, a hand- some, imposing figure under a huge chandelier, dishing out \"Americanism Medals\", \"Friendship Awards\" and cean tenmal medallions for this is the DAR' 100th year. Even in private you felt that Marie Yochim was on parade. Her two adv- era, a wife and husband team, guarded br closely, rephrasing questionsm and upplying her with answers. Sometimes they talked about her as if she were not n the room at al. The president general was on a Eur- an tour, so I asked her whether the 5AR had forgiven the English for We a&'t even thU k abot that In the DAR.

It's just a dif- ference in the way the countries are run.\" Would you accept an invitation to the palace if yoli had one? \"Oh,..I certainly would! In fact, the last time I was here, I did go to Lord Hailsham's. We did go to the House of Lords and met with him. I have some pictures with me.\" To become one of the DAR's 203,000 members you have to prove lineal descent from one of the American revo- lutionaries. It is enough to show that your aitcestor supported the cause, even if he did not fight. But there is no such thing as honorary membership, however famous you are. Barbara Bush has qualified, so have Nancy Reagan and Rosalynn Carter. Mrs T Dan Quayle will be admitted at next month's Board Mrs Eldred Martin Yochim is proud of her legs and proud of her country. She tells Christian Tyler about the role of patriotism in the US e meeting. I just got her papers,\" the e president confided. 1- Marie Hirst is a 12th generation Vir- e ginian and a 10th generation resident of a Falls Church. She grew up a Democrat i- but is now Republican.

These days, as well as distributing literature in primary schools, the Daughters hand out civic manuals to new arrivals and, when they come out of the courtroom five years later with citizen status, welcome them with flags and speeches. I asked Marie if she was worried by the latest wave of Hispanic immigration into the South. \"Well, it seems a little bit scary. Down there, they're having a lot of trouble down in Miami. But I can't make any comment on that because I don't really know.\" People say that white Americans could be in a minority in the next cen- tury. . . \"Well, now, it might. You could be right Because it looks to me like many of the whites want two careers and they don't have time to have a child, and yet, you see, a lot of Hipanics have a lot\" Would you face that with equanimity, or would that be a pity? \"No, I don't see that anything like that is a pity. I mean, if tey become good American citienus and do what's right by their country, I would not be worriedn We talked about the controversy over \"multicultural\" curricla n American schools.

The answer was patriotism. Didt' the war have a good result? \"Sure. Well, it certainly brought back patriotism. We had a renewal of patrio- tism, and that is something I don't think any country can stand up with- out. Everybody came together. The yel- low ribbons, the flags were out, every- body came together and it was just great\" Who are the unpatriotic Americans? \"Yes, well, we have some. We have atheists, who don't want you to say anything about God or the Bible and Christianity. They don't understand. You have some of those who get out and burn the flag. There are some in our country, yes.\" Are they a threat? \"No, I would say they're not a threat, but they certainly aren't good Ameri- can citizens, let's put it that way. It's hard to believe a citizen could burn their own country's flag.\" Why do people do it, do you think? \"I really don't know. I feel like that if they don't like living in the country, they should go someplace else where they might be happier.\" Apart from attending tea parties at the White House and getting presiden- tial messges of support at convention time, the DAR claims to be apolitical. \"We maintain no lobby at local, state or national level It's not that type of thing at all. We're a service organisation.\" However, the DAR does pass resolu- tins. R did ampaign against the Equal Rights Amendment, which to writequality for women into the US Constitution. Marie seemed confnued as to why the ERA was opposed, saying she had nothin against women getting ahead, but that they shouldn't be liable for military service. \"I hate to me a mother go over there and get killed and leave three, four chil- dren.

   "text_content" : "Attacks on Robin Leigh-Pemberton and George Carey smack of intolerance, says Dominic Lawsbn erton's assertion, in his position as governor of the Bank of England, that \"We are now 9oming out of recession\". On the other was the similar vituperation being beaped by Conservative MPs on the Arch- bishop of Canterbury, for the Pri- mate's remarks that the rioting in towns such as Newcastle was \"inex- tricably linked to social deprivation, poor housing and illiteracy\". There is a nauseating aspect to the protests of these stage armies of i: Â·\"'Â· \" ' sy mnle. i front sterday's .

One would think there wgre some closed shop designed to ke.p a monopoly of political disassidn to a trade union msquerading as the House of Com- moni. Just as closed shops were designed to block able competition for the same Jobs, so these MPs know that whlie their speeches are dismissed as the empty rhetoric of party c laee men- the utterances of men like George Carey and Robin Leigh-Pemberton are actually lis- tened toby the public with respect. It is only becuse Leigh-Pemberton has a reputation for integrity, if a rather bumbling integrity, that he has so worried the Labour Party. As for Carey, be is a member of the House of Lords, which is, Isuppose, a reasonable constitutional proof of his right to speak ex cathulr. While the critics of Leigh-Pmb- erton and Carey accused them of being too \"political\" the truth is that it is a mark of a liberal society that leading figures can speak wth out fear of unfortunate political consequences. The mark of Illiberal societies is that everything becomes political and nthinu al be aid r public which not coe spond to ncuhed docimMi Besids, both mi.. iUits, pin- atriednd pvuploirwttem to engage in rational doiusion.

This as the vision, sanc- toned by the Conservative Party, of John Schei ger, director of many excellent motion ictures. Doubtless I when Hugh \"Chariots of Fire\" Hud- son fnishes his party political mov- , les for the Labour Party we will have a similar o-focus fact-ftee film about what Britain would be like under a Labour government. With such vacuity taking the place of political debate, it is hardly surprising that the contributions of the governor and the archbishop make such an impression. The arch- b ishop a natural politician. I was by his ability to steal the headlines, Just as journalists were beginning to get their teeth into the developing split between the liber- als and traditionalists in the Church of England. If George Carey did nothing else with his speech he set up a very big hare to lure away the hounds of schism. Within the church, unfortunately, Carey's role seems precisely that of the propagandists within the Con- servative party - to pretend that politics do not exist and that a haze of well meaning is the answer to enuine and heart-elt differences. s letter to The Tnmes this week, in response to the Archdeacon of York's warning of schism was a masterpiece of evasion. Having, before his enthronement described opponents of women priests as \"her- etics\" Carey now manages to write a letter on divisions in the church, without even mentioning the issue of women. Which leads one to a rather depressing conclusion: throughout society those with power dare not speak the truth. That practice apprently, is a lux- ury which can beafforded only by those without great influence. * Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator",

   "text_content" : "Nigel Spivey I- I .KNEW I was in for a modern hallucinogenic experience as soon as the Severn Bridge came into view. Late September sunlight had transformed the myriad cones into a surface of rich fili- gree; and the burnished pros- pect down the estuary called for the palette of Turner. Even more dreamlike, my Alfa and I sailed across at soinething more than 0.5 mph, and cruised easily into the stately pleasure dome that is Aust Service Station. Here there were more hallucino- genic harbingers: entire fami- lies clad in purple and pink tracksuits, outfits that called for the palette of Picasso. I hailed one of these harlequins. \"I say. Is this the Acid House gathering?\" Something less than West Country charm came back. \"Trying to be funny, mate?\" I have observed before that when a member of the track- suit-wearing classes addresses you as his mate, he is gener- ally intending to assault you. I retired, and sought out a man in the livery of the Royal Auto- mobile Club. Much more con- genial: he looked at my car, and opined that it was great, so long as it was running. Had he, I wondered, any Acidic House knowledge? \"You don't look like one of them,\" he said. I explained that my wife had refused to let me take a razor to my corduroys. \"Well. Sometimes they con- gregate here. Come from all over - Swindon, Shepton Mal- let. You name it. But you might find 'em anywhere along the M4. Arresting on sight is what they want.\" I set off along the M4 again. My notebook records the quest: 10.00 pm. Leigh Delamere Ser- vice Station. Telephone to wife: Am in Leigh Delamere. Where should I be? 10.30 pm. Supper, at MacDon- ald's Drive-Thru Restaurant on the Great West Road, Swindon. I reason that if I stay inside my extremely high performance car, it is less likely to be whipped by local joyriders. 11.05 pm. Membury Service Station. Yes: the first pair of slashed trousers; scraps of bin- liner couture; and those bouncy black shoes that Min- nie Mouse used to sport. These are Acid House dudes. \"Follow I llllelll 1I111I ~illl(UI~~II~L~ ~UVI~ the M4. Arresting on sight is what they want.\" I set off along the M4 again. My notebook records the quest: lo~oo pm. Leigh Delamere Ser- vice Station. Telephone to wife: Am in Leigh Delamere. Where should I be? ~0.30 pm. Supper, at MacDon- aid's DriveThru Restaurant on the Great West Road, Swindon. I reason that if I stay inside my extremely high performance car, it is less likely to be whipped by localjoyriders. 11.05 pm. Membury Service Station. Yes: the hrst pair of slashed trousers; scraps of bin- liner couture; and those bouncy black shoes that Min- nie Mouse used to sport. These are Acid House dudes. \"Foliow us,\" they say. \"We're going to Werritt's Att.\" 11.45 pm. Twenty-three hand- brake turns later, we reach a remote barn. It could be Wer- ritt's Att: it could be anywhere. The half-timbered walls are heaving. A fiver at the entrance gets my hand stamped by a man in dark glasses. He is the sort I should arrest on sight, but I am con- tent to point out to him that there is no sun for his glasses to exclude. He pushes me inside with a sneer. 11.55 pm. I am briefly stupe- fied by the energy of the throng dancing around me. Twisting like dervishes, sweat pouring from their fevered bod- ies: they seem to be in states of genuine ecstasy. Then I glance down at my own body. All I am doing is shifting my weight delicately from one foot to HAWKS -&-I HANDSAWS another, and yet I too am danc- ing like a dervish. So much for the ecstasy. This is a trick of the lights. 12.15 am. At the edge of the din, I start chatting to a youth. His hair is like Rupert Brooke's, only wild and lank. He says to me: \"Do you smoke?\" I eye him carefully, lest he be one of those Puritans who throw buckets of water over anyone who so much as strikes a match in their pres- ence. \"An odd cigar,\" I confess. \"Oh, man. Right. Cool. Yeah. Cigars with whacky baccy, huh?\" \"Whacky baccy? Pure Havana, old bean. Try one.\" 12.30 am. Rupert Brooke sucking hard at his Romeo Y Julieta, and looking green; me feeling slightly sore at having given it away. Then a girl prof- fers me a bag of nibbles. Unusual nibbles these: minia- ture dried mushrooms which are exceedingly tasty. I take another handful: this is welcome nourishment, and almost makes up for the cigar. \"Er, yeah, hey, like steady,\" says the girl. Munching hap- pily, I resolve to look out for these in Tesco. 1.15 am. Go outside for some fresh West Country air, and meet a chap in tweeds. I am feeling unusually benevolent. I urge him to join the party. In a gruff West Country manner, he says he would like to spray us all with a twelve-bore. \"Come, come,\" I say. \"No one is doing any harm, except perhaps to the odd eardrum. I am glad to see young people having a good time. Poor things. If they try to earn enough money to put a roof over their heads, we damn them for greed. If they give up and camp down by Waterloo, we damn them for their spine- lessness. I doubt there's more than a dozen in there whose parents aren't separated, divorced or thrice remarried. Une generation perdue. More sinned again than sinning. Do come in and freak out.\" But my new friend - every- one is now my friend - stalks off, still choleric to make a telephone call. 1.30 am. The cry goes up, \"Beasts!\" and pandemonium ensues. Dogs, whistles, head- lights and scuffles. Still mel- low, I watch the old West Country game of taking a shy at the constable' s helmet with a half-brick. Then I notice Rupert Brooke being dragged into the back of a van by eight men twice his size. \"Beasts!\" cries Rupert. I remonstrate with those manhandling him. \"Yes, you are being perfectly beastly,\" I say. \"Somewhere around here is a man in dark glasses, whom I most strongly recommend you to arrest instead of this harmless orphan.\" My pleading, once more, fails with these burly West Country men. \"Wanna be nicked with him, son?\" says one, shoving me back with the butt of his truncheon. All around, an exodus of dudes: on skateboards, in cus- tomised Beetles. The night is wrecked and over: I wander back to my Alfa. 2.05 am. All quiet at Wer- ritt's Att. The moon trickles a little light over a silvery grain silo. Everything is still: includ- ing the engine of my Alfa. A surfeit of handbrake turns did it. But I find I have a few mushrooms in my pocket. Chewing these, I doze off: to dream of Horlicks and slippers and dead-heading the roses.",
