FRIDAY Evening. Contrary to the expectations in cer- Lain quarters, the control authorities made no further adjustment to the sterling-U.S. dollar quotation despite the flurry in New York late yesterday. The market itself expressed the opinion that the sudden weakness in sterling may have been due to French nationals who were liquidating ster- ling obtained from gold sales in London. Satisfaction was expressed that the control had held to the pre- vious rate, and at the news that any American demand for dollar exchange will be satisfied at the rate of $4.02, if such demand is connected with the liquidation of pre-war sterling balances or with current trade trans- actions with the British Empire. The result of the weekly tender for Treasury bills was. much in accord with expectations. Applications for the Â£55,000,000 available totalled Â£89,165,000, as compared with Â£60,160,000 for the Â£50,000,000 offered a week ago. A full allotment was made at an average rate of discount of Â£3 11s 1.12d per cent., as against Â£3 12s 0.98d per cent. last Friday. The market syndicate obtained a quota of 47 per cent. Tenders will be invited next week for Treasury bills to be allotted to the maximum amount of Â£55,000,000. Little change took place in market rates, although discount houses were more in- clined to sell bills to the clearing banks, whose buying rates were 3%V per cent. for Novembers and 3% per cent. for December maturities. The \" hot\" Treasury bills were called 3Y per cent. Leading houses quoted 3Ys-3% per cent. as their buying rates for three months bank drafts. LoAss DISCoU.vT PERH CE.'. PER CENT.

The commission on gold coin and bullion is now only %' per cent., as against % per cent. Speculative buying with only small offerings caused a further sharp rise in silver prices, spot being %d up at 22/sd per ounce and forward delivery %sd higher at 21l~%ld. These are the highest levels since November, 1936. Dollar Steady No further change was made in the official dollar-sterling exchange rate of $4.02-$4.04, 'but the Canadian dollar re- acted slightly to $4.43, the spread again being widened. Alterations in Continentals were few and far between, but the Finnish mark was called 200 middle.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 15th Sept. The war boom showed signs of fading in the Stock Market, and the final list was again irregular, prices showing changes of fractions to $2 either way. Business was less active, turnover totalling 1,590,000 shares, against 2,010,000 yesterday. Operators were cautious from the open- ing, which was active but irregular. Sterling's break proved a restraining in- fluence, and business during the morning turned very quiet, with small mixed price movements, and the general trend at midday was lower. The volume continued to taper off in the early afternoon, when the changes com- prised fractions to a point in both direc- tions, with losses predominating. Steels and Motors came under moderate pressure, but Rails showed resistance on brightening prospects for freight traffic. Coppers, Oils and Rubbers were inclined to ease. Exceptionally, Merchandisings continued to receive support. Textile shares were bought in the later dealings, but the rest of the market continued quiet, with prices fluctuating indecisively. The close was irregular. All three Dow-Jones averages closed higher, Industrials improving 0.32 to 154.03, Rails 0.08 to 32.48, Utilities 0.23 to 24.54. Of 895 stocks dealt in, 357 declined, 352 rose and 186 were unchanged. Sentiment remains bullish over the out- look for expanding domestic trade, but market operators are cautious pending action by Congress on the Neutrahty Act. At the same time, the manner in which recent profit-taking has been absorbed suggests that the market's technical posi- tion is stronger than many had believed possible in view of the rapidity of the advance. In the Bond market U.S. Governments and Railroads kept firm; bond sales totalled $9,350,000, against $10,330,000 yesterday. MOODY'S commodity index (31st Dec. = 100) was unchanged at 169.9. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation (the chief operating unit of United States Steel Corporation) has reaffirmed steel prices for the fourth quarter; other companies are expected to follow. The unchanged fourth-quarter prices are applicable only to shipments made up to the end of the year. after which higher quotations are held to be a certainty. The advance of $2 a ton for pig-iron is now general. Makers of chemicals, rayon and news- print have reaffirmed their prices for the fourth quarter in order to prevent run- away markets. Railroad freight loadings for the week to 9th September totalled 667,400 cars, a decrease of 54,300 on the previous week, but 98,500 above a year ago. The Stock Exchange short interest on 31st August totalled 435,273 shares, com- pared with 481,599 on 31st July. Loans to brokers fell $69,000,000 in the week to 13th September to $430,000,000. Other loans for purchasing or carrying securities increased $2,000,000 to $178,000,000. A suit has been filed against Aluminum Company of America and two of its affiliates for $1,500,000 on charges of con- spiracy to violate the Freight Rates Act. Sears Roebuck and Co.'s sales from 14th August to 10th September totalled $44,800,000, against $39,890,000 from 17th July to 13th August. Addressograph declared regular divi- dend of 35c, payable 10th October to holders of 26th September.

   "text_content" : "Sales to provide for the special Settlement next Thursday, 21st Sep- tember, continued to exercise a malign influence yesterday in several Stock Exchange markets. Under the regulations reprinted in THE FINANCIAL TIMES last Saturday it was provided that differences in re- spect of war-time cash bargains-as well as payments arising out of pre- war Account dealings-\" should be settled on 21st September in respect of business transacted up to 15th September inclusive.\" Last-minute Selling A number of operators had evidently postponed until the last minute the sale of such proportion of their pre- war commitments as they had been unable to arrange to carry over or pay for. As yesterday was the last oppor- tunity to sell in time to receive pay- ment next Thursday, it was to this pressure that there was attributed certain realisations in the Mining markets, the Iron and Steel group and. in lesser degree, elsewhere. Five-day Plan Assuming the Settlement goes through with reasonable smoothness, members will know better where they are. The subsequent settlements of cash differences as between members are to be held on the first working day of each month in respect of business transacted up to five working days earlier. This implicitly recognises the fact that a bull under the present cash dealings r6gime will be able to secure at least five days' run for his money. Towards the close of the last war, when optimism was running high, there were quite extensive and often very profitable speculative dealings on this five-day plan. Rising Yankees Oils, Yankees and a great many South American descriptions attracted considerable inquiry yesterday. Lead- ing Yankees were bid up to their over- night parities, or even higher. Part of the demand for Americans was attributed to the surprising fall in sterling in New York on Thursday. Local operators in some cases repur- chased United States Steel and other similar shares they had recently sold. They came back to the view that it would be wise to hold a certain amount of American stock as an insur- ance against a possible further depreciation in sterlthg. Actually the apparent acute weak- ness of sterling in New York in the past two days proves to have been a storm in a teacup. All legitimate traders can obtain $4.02 for the Â£ and there is no reason why they should accept less. The Bank of England's action on Thursday in adjusting its buying rate for dollars to $4.04 was misconstrued. Evidently the dollar rate and the price of gold are to remain pegged until further notice. ghl ~iartst",

   "text_content" : "FRIDAY Evening. The first full week of Stock Ex change dealing under th' new order came to an end to-day with little ex pansion of business and a rather dull tone. Price declines were attributed largely to efforts to sell in view of the fact that to-day was the last day for making cash bargains for settlement next Thursday. Dealings remained mainly a matter of matching buyers against sellers. Demand for Oil shares, which were among the firm exceptions to the general trend, was evidently inspired by keenness to acquire holdings out side the area of hostilities yet likely to benefit from the economic effects of war. Aggregate of marked bargains in all markets was 2,408, against 2,647 yesterday. Dealing in the gilt-edged market became still more congested, buyers at the fixed prices becoming more difcult to find Consols 2% per cent., quoted yesterday a! ust above the minimum of 62, were reduced to-day to that figure. A little swapping from War Loan and Conversion 3% per cent. into Conversion Y% per cent. was attempted, and business n the latter was marked frequently from he minimum of 100% to 101. India stocks remained very quiet, and he only changes in the Corporation and Dominion lists were the result of adjust ments of minimum quotations on the deduc tion of dividends. Gilt-edged prices Page 4 BOND PRICES NOMINAL With interest in the Foreign Bond narket at a low ebb, jobbers had little business to-day. The closing of open bear positions which occupied dealers at the beginning of the week now appears to be completed and no further buying interest made its appearance. Bargains were still a matter of negotiation and wide margins were quoted at levels for the most part below those ruling previously. German 5 per cent. and 4% per cent. were quoted 1% and % lower respectively and are now near purely nominal prices at 62 and 5. Austrian 4% per cent. were down to 7, 3 points lower than on Thurs lay. Other European bonds were also quoted at lower prices. Recent buying interest in Argentines and Chileans has abated for the present and bonds of both countries were un changed, although fully steady. Far Eastern bonds, which were well supported at the beginning of the week, turned easy. China 4% per cent. 1898 dropped 1 to 49 and Japanese 4 pc 1899 also shed a point to 27%. Japanese 5 per cent. 1907 and 6 per cent. 1924 were fractionally weaker at 31 and 40% respectively. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 Better Market in Rails Dealers in the Home Rail market re ported that the better secured prior charges were still reasonably marketable, although disposal of junior Preferences continued to be a matter of some difficulty: Jobbers found that there was much less tendency to sell the Ordinary stocks than has been evident of late. This improve ment was reflected in all-round firmness. Southern Deferred were 1 point to the good at 9 and L.M.S. made a similar im- provement to 10%. Great Western were also bought, were also firmly inclined and closed % better at 24. The end of the week found some of the recent purchasers of Argentine Rails in- clined to take profits. Fractional losses in a quiet market were the order of the day. B.A.G.S. Preference yielded % to 253 and the Ordinary closed % lower at 9%. B.A. and Pacific receded to 4% and B.A. West- ern were 4 down at 6%. Entre Rios pro- vided an exception and advanced % to 4%. Central Argentine issues evidenced a tendency on the part of Ordinary stock- holders to exchange into marginal Prefer- ence stocks. Thus, while the. Ordinary fell /4 to 8 the 6 per cent. Preference gained 33/ points to 28%. San Paulo advanced. Despite the uncertainty of Wall Street overnight, American Rails were firm on the London market. Chesapeake and Ohio were marked 2% points higher at 47, although little stock changed hands. Home and Overseas Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS SOLD Steel and Shipping Shares React The behaviour of the Industrial market was no more satisfactory than it was esterday. The tone remained-heavy and s realisations again were in progress in ertain groups prices in the main pursued n unsatisfactory course. Owing to taxa- ion uncertainties the public still held loof from the market, despite the attrac ive levels to which many shares have allen. A few courageous buyers did come n and their purchases resulted in a few allies in Brewery and other shares. Although it looked as if the recent elling of BANKING shares had neared com- letion, there was some liquidation of Jational Provincial issues, and falls of 5s esulted. Midland and Westminster issues were steady. Lloyds receded 4s and Barclays \" B \" 2s 6d. Lower levels were airly general for INSURANCE shares, but aain the movement was more a readjust- oent of values than the outcome of selling. Quotations also continued to weaken among ELECTRIC SUPPLY issues, but to a Lsser extent than earlier in the week. County of London were 6d lower at 29s 6d, with business done at 28s 9d. Recessions f Is apieee took place in Metropolitans, Yorkshire and Midland Counties Electrics. Some liquidation of ELECTRICAL EQUIP- :wNT shares was encountered. It was ight, but came on a market lacking ready uyers and poor prices were obtained by ellers. Principal movement was fall of s 3d to 14s in Cromptoh Parkinsons. tr-..., .^ A ....l: ~~ 4Â·~r ,.nn,,,, qn na,,,,, and changes were few. Standards ittracted and rallied 6d to 10s 3d. Rolls- Royce were 2s 6d lower at 85s. Austin improved A to 2%, but Great Universal 'A\" were weak at 19s and Tillings *hanged down to 3Ss 9d, closing at 35s. ~ACRAmTs were dull, with Fairey down 9d ; 15s. Hawker Siddeleys changed down ;o 10s Sd, closing lls 8d with a loss of 6d. SHuIG shares suffered a general re- cttion on more moderate views regarding he outlook. Funea Withy closed lsg9d Lown at 22s Odand P. and 0. yielded s to 12s. Coast Lines came back d to 12s 9d mid Cunards 94 to 4s d8 oered. Several ~oiN and STam shaares, followed lie general trend, aided by a few light ales. Dorman Longs/left of 2s lower at 38s, bargains down to 21s 3d being re- orded. Hadfields and United Steels shed a apiece. Indian Irons yielded %a to 2%.. A fall of 9d to 38s 9d occurred in Staveley Coals. Howard and Bulloughs gained 6d to 8s. Inquiry for TEXTILES ceased -,I. with some profit-taking in progress; the low priced issues reacted. Of the higher- priced issues, J. and P. Coats weakened Is 3d to 26s 3d. Patons and Baldwins were down 9d to 47s 9d. Bleachers were realised. Fears of an increase in the Excise duty and inability of traders in rayon goods to give firm quotations checked public interest in RAYON shares. Courtaulds, while dull, were unaltered. Celanese issues were 3d easier. In STORES, Marks and Spencer \" A\" improved % to 2%, but Great Universal reacted 2s 6d to 22s 6d. Woolworths were steady. Whiteleys were down 's to % on the dividend decision. Among Provision Stores, United Dairies were flat at 2%. BREWERY shares were notable for rallies of 3s 6d to 43s 6d in Hewitts and 6d to 21s 6d in Meux. Threlfalls, Charrington, Ind Coope and City of London Preferred were each 5s lower. British-American Tobaccos rallied further to 4 e. Imperials were Y off at 5'/.. Elsewhere, a few Cinemas were firmer on the decision to reopen theatres. News paper shares were marked down appre ciably, especially the fixed-dividend issues. Dollar issues went better during the afternoon, when Nickels were strong at 56. U.S. Steels were 93%, Bethlehems 114, Chryslers 107% and General Motors 64%. Brazil Tractions were good at 8%. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 FRESH ADVANCE IN OILS Interest in OIL shares became more general, and although the upward move ment was still led by the Trinidad issues, rises were well spread throughout the list. Outstanding in the Trinidad group was a fresh advance in Apex, which closed 2s 3d higher at 30s 3d. Trinidad Lease holds further improved Y to 4'%. and Trinidad Petroleum Developments 6d to 51s. United British at 9s'also were 6d better and there was a rise of 4Yd in Kerns to 3s 6d. Royal Dutch were in renewed demand after yesterday's setback -and at 42% passed last year's best price. Shells were a good feature at 4%, showing a rise of %:, and Shell Unions were marked up a point to 17%. Anglo-Iranians at 3'%, and Burmahs at S% both were %I higher. Oil Prices Page 4 RUBBERS CHEAPER With the price of the raw material show- ing an uncertain trend, the Rubber share market turned easy. although selling was relatively light. Most price changes were adverse, but buyers of Nordanal raised the price is to 11s, while Tanjong Malim also added Is at 15s. Grand Central, which have been .prominent. of late, lost somn Ltkheiz recent improvement, the price clog at 11s 6d, in comparison with 12s 6d yesterday. Rubber Trust began unchanged at 28s 9d, but a seller came in and the finish was 6d down at 28s 3d. United Sus Betong were also a shade cheaper at 50s, while Tamiang shed Is 3d to close at 20s. On the Mincing Lane Stock 2xchange conditions were very quiet. Merlimau were dealt in at 2s 7d and 2s 7%d, and London Asiatic were on offer at 3s 7Yd. Rubber Trust were quoted at 28s-28s 6d. Tea shares on the Stock Exchange were firm. Buyers, it was said, were at last convinced that such issues were cheap, but business was restricted by the small supply of shares. Amblamana realised 9d, Assam Consolidated 4s 6d, Attaree Khat 17s 6d, and Dimbula Valley 17s. Inquiry con- tinued to the close of business. Rubber Prices Page 4 MINES GENERALLY DULL New Taxation Decree Depresses Westralian Gold Shares Sellers of Kaffirs in connection with the pre-war open position were still in evi- dence. Quotations were soon depressed as buyers remained aloof, the pending week- end break being a discouraging factor in this respect. Johannesburg continued to give some support at lower levels, but on a smaller scale than yesterday. Sub Nigel at 10% and Crown at 15 each fell % and Geduld Y to 7%. Of the non producers, West Wits. closed % off at 2%, after 2, Venterspost %1 down at 1%, Vlakfontein Ve lower at %e and Marievale 9d to the bad at 14s 6d. In the Finance group, Gold Fields dropped Y to 2%, as did General Mining to 3%. Some dealers reported a rather better turnover in West Africans, with buyers and sellers fairly well balanced. Price movements were thus small apart from a decline of %s to '%a in Kwahu. West Australian Gold shares were marked down following the receipt of the news that the Commonwealth is imposing an extra tax on these concerns of 75 per cent. of the excess gold price above Â£9 Australian per ounce. The present equiva- lent of 168s sterling for gold in Australian currency is 210s, of which the mines under this new ruling will now receive 187s 6d A., equal to 150s sterling. Declines in the shares were rarely more than 3d in amount, although Wiluna lost 9d to 7s 9d, North Kalgurli (1912) 6d to 18s 6d and Lake View and Star also 6d to 18i. Rhodesian Coppers remained dull, Rho- kana falling K further to 12% and Rhodesian Anglo-American 9d to 24s. Nchanga were lowered A to 1%, Selection Trust 9d to 14s 3d and Roan and Rhodesian Selection 6d apiece. Elsewhere. Rio Tinto declined % to 12. Demand in Tin shares slackened. Southern Tronoh were raised 9d to 9s 6d and Sungei Besi %. to 1, but Petaling reacted 9d to 19s, Malayan '/r to 1%. and Southern Malayan Ya to 1%,. Mining share prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "The shadow of the supplementary Budget is a dark background to markets. Heavier taxation has to be faced. It would be wrong to attribute the week's realisations to this cause alone. Part of the selling was doubt- less to put holders in funds to meet liabilities in connection with the post- poned Account. At the same time it should be emphasised that in some instances prices were lowered with- out any weight of selling to bring yields into line with the returns to be expected under present-day monetary conditions. Taxation of Industry Whatever additional taxation is im- posed, it seems to be accepted by the City as a foregone conclusion that the burden will weigh heavily upon cer- tain industries. In addition to income- tax, N.D.C. and armaments profits tax already are in force. With the advent of war the daily bill for the nation has gone up with a bound and the wherewithal to meet it has to be found. That hard fact is recognised by the investing public; hence the expectations of higher duties on tobacco, beer, tea and petrol. The weakest sections of the Indus- trial market this week have been Brewery and Tobacco shares. The depreciation among Brewery descrip- tions has been so considerable that the heaviest duty possible, without seriously checking the consumption of beer, is discounted in current share values. On the long view Brewery shares are cheap, but at the moment they are for intending purchasers possessed with patience. British-American Tobacco Higher taxation of the tobacco com- panies is inevitable, but many people consider that British-American in this respect will fare better than Imperial. British-American is concerned with the export side and its leaf will not be subject to any higher duty that may be imposed. As the larger part of its stocks probably is held abroad, the expense of air raid insurance is. not incurred. On the other hand, an increase in income-tax would affect the company since it has made a practice of bear- ing the cost of this tax by distributing tax-free dividends. Bats are now 411 (after 4), as compared with 4Q on 30th August. Imperials in that .period have declined from 64 to 5-. Itritas Articles by \" Autolycus \" appear as usual on other days of the week.",

   "text_content" : "It has not been easy to reconcile the slight adjustment in the New York rate made by the Bank of England on Thursday with the weakness shown by the New York quotations on that day and yesterday. The Bank of England, as the agent of the Treasury, has the prior call on certain foreign currencies, and fixes the rates at which business in them is to be done here. Dollars are the principal moneys, and having started the United States currency at $4.02-$4.06 to the pound, the Bank decided on Thursday to narrow the quotation by reducing to $4.04, the amount for which it will sell a pound. In other words, the middle rate was lowered from $4.04 to $4.03, to the benefit of sellers of the currency (the Canadian rate was similarly treated), but, as it appears, greatly to the disturbance of the markets in other countries. This is an illustration of the unsettlement caused by departure from a \"pegged \" level which has been maintained for any appreciable time. In this case the original rate had lasted for little more than a week, but the period was long enough for the opinion to be formed-without any other basis than the fact that no change had been made-that maintenance of the rates already prescribed repre- sented the settled policy of the autho- rities. It may be that the example of 1914-1918 helped to surround the Bank's first decision on the present occasion with an atmosphere of per- manency. The rate was not \" pegged \" during the last war until early in 1916, but it was then held steady for more than three years. Yesterday's repetition of a disparity of more than 20 cents, adverse to sterling, between the British fixed rate and that quoted in New York, in face of the assurance given overnight in New York that demands for dollars conforming to existing regulations would be satisfied in London at $4.02, needs elucidation. The explanation now accepted is that a few holders had become anxious to get rid of sterling balances at the best rate obtainable in an unwilling \"black\" market, and that the depres- sion should be merely temporary. Meanwhile the dollar has not lost its interest for British investors, in spite of the control exercised over certain foreign securities as well as over the currencies. Transfer of the securities in question is still possible if official consent is obtained before- hand, but whether a sale of American stocks is made abroad or to an inhabitant of this country, the basis of the transaction must be the dollar buying rate of the Bank of England. For that reason the English equiva- lents contained in THE FINANCIAL TIMES table of New York stock prices are now worked out on the Bank's fixed rate of $4.04. The Stock Ex- change traditionally quotes Americans in terms of a five-dollar pound, for the sake of simplicity in calculation, and this accounts for the present wide margin of the English equivalents over the corresponding New York prices. If the unofficial exchange rates now current in New York were fol- lowed, the disparity would be still wider, but the fact that any dollar pro- ceeds of a sale must be offered to the authorities by the British recipient rules out the fluctuating quotations and dictates the use of that laid down by the authorities.",

   "text_content" : "The abnormal situation was the determining cause of the reduction from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. in the dividend paid on the Deferred shares of Harrisons and Crosfield for the past year. Net profits were rather larger at Â£345,300, against Â£333,900, and the payment is covered by earnings equal to about 26J per cent. In normal cir- cumstances a larger distribution would have been justified, but it is proposed to transfer Â£50,000 to a divi- dend equalisation reserve as a pre- cautionary measure. Increased holding in subsidiary companies, together with the larger sum advanced, makes the total in- terest Â£879,400, against Â£742,700. In- vestments in tea, rubber and other produce companies amount to Â£916,400 and show an excess on valuation over the book figure, leaving intact the special reserve of Â£850,000. Cash and Government securities stand at much the same figure of Â£861,000. The larger movement of rubber envisaged by the latest quota change, together with the higher price, make the future for the company look more hopeful than for other types of business under war conditions.",

The re- sumption was two months after the general meeting, at which Sir A.

Part of the revival was due to the increased demand for phosphoric coke resulting from the activity of the steel industry. This should continue, and war conditions are in general likely to be favourable. A thorough technical reconstruction has been carried through in recent years, and financial reconstruction may not now be con- sidered necessary.

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The sharp depreciation in sterling in New York late on Thursday accen- tuatea interest in tne omrcial BanK o0 England rate yesterday. Promptly, however, the quotation was $4.02 to $4.04, as on the previous day. This was interpreted as indicating that the break in New York was due to special circumstances, mainly tech- nical, which did not alarm our autho- rities. There was no support for any suggestions that the American autho- rities are no longer able to use the facilities enjoyed under the Tripar- tite Pact. Satisfaction was expressed at the message from New York that any American demand for dollar ex- change will be satisfied at $4.02 in London, if such demand is connected with the liquidation of pre-war sterling balances or with current trade transactions with the British Empire. This was confirmed in London and it was assumed that the sterling rate will be held at the existing level. Foreign Balances Despite this ruling, sterling was again weak in New York, touching $3.75 before recovering slightly. In usually well-informed quarters, this was attributed to panic selling by foreign holders of sterling balances unable to comply with the regulations in London and who were forced to liquidate elsewhere. The volume of sales was inconsiderable. A Discount Alliance THE FINANCIAL TIMES understands that the \"marriage\" is pending of two important firms in the London discount market. Both are private companies, one being more than three- quarters of a century old and the other about thirty years of age. The combined capital of the firms con- cerned is Â£1,000.000. These large firms are falling in with the wishes of the authorities by join- ing forces. Incidentally, another firm of bill brokers is shortly acquiring a new partner. A feature yesterday was an increase in the total of bills for which syndi- cate members are permitted to tender. The three big companies have had their quota considerably increased, while other members have been granted smaller percentage additions. The total of applications is related to the capital of the several concerns.",

PAINT DIVIDENDS The dividend of 4 per cent. now de- clared on the Ordinary shares of Pinchin Johnson and Co. reflects con- servation of liquid resources in view of national requirements. The pay- .ment repre,~e ts a drop of 34 per cent. on the prlious interim, though the accompanying statement indicates that sales and estimated net profits have made a satisfactory advance on the coiresponding period of 1988. It remains to be seen how the war will affect the niany international interests of this progressive paint and varnish manufacturer. The International Paint and Com- positions Company, on the other hand, is maintaining its interim dividend at 4 per cent. Owing to its position as a leading supplier of paints and com- positions for shipping, the company may be expected to have benefited both by the rapid increase in naval construction and the revival in mer- cantile contracting since the an- nouncement of the Government's subsidy plans.

That factor in cost sheets has been more fully felt by the Alliance in recent months, but the company has been able to offset the increase in manufacturing costs and in rates and taxes by economies in distribution charges. Sales and rentals brought in more, and although residuals returned less the net revenue gained Â£6,500 at Â£74,600.

   "text_content" : "American brokerage firms with offices in London have decided to form an association in order that they can operate in this country under the provisions of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act without the necessity of obtaining a license. This decision was reached at a meeting in London yesterday. About 15 firms were represented. The body is to be styled the Association of New York Stock Exchange Member Firms having Representation in the United Kingdom. A committee of seven was appointed to act for a year. The members are as follow:- Messrs. F. BODEM (Carl M. Loeb Rhoades and Co.), L. W. EDWARDS (Shields and Co.), J. D. MAIER (Hall- gart6n and Co.), L. L. TWEEDY (Baker Weeks and Harden), G. WALKER (Fenner and Beane). N. E. WHITE (Dominick and Dominick) and D. YASSUKOVICH (White Weld and Co.). The first meeting of the Committee will be held next week, when a chair- man will be elected. APPLICATION PENDING Board of Trade The Committee will consider a final draft of the memorandum and articles of association and by-laws which will be submitted to the Board of Trade together with an application for a declaration that the association is a recognised association of dealers in securities for the purposes of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act. The provisions of the Act regulating the business of dealing in securities will not come fully into force until a day to be appointed by the Board of Trade. After the appointed day no person, with certain exceptions, will be allowed to carry on the business of dealing in securities unless he is in possession of a license granted by the Board of Trade or is a member of a recog- nised Stock Exchange or association of dealers in securities. The Board of Trade has postponed from yesterday to 15th March next the final date for lodging applications for licenses to deal in stocks and shares under the Act. American brokers yesterday reported an increased volume of sales of American securities on behalf of British holders. Official permission is readily forthcoming for these transactions. Sellers in most cases immediately receive the cash con- sideration involved in sterling and the purchase money payable in the United States augments the British Government's dollar resources there. FOREIGN STOCK RESTRICTIONS AMENDMENTS SOUGHT Certain jobbers in the Stock Exchange are endeavouring to secure amendment to the list of stocks which has been drawn up as indicating those issues which may fall under the Treasury restriction on dealing in Foreign stocks. This list, which was itself drawn up by the market and not by the Treasury, has already been amended once by the making of certain omissions. It is now claimed that it still includes a number of stocks upon which no dividend or interest is forthcoming, and restriction of which could serve no useful purpose. It is understood that no concerted action to this end has been taken. In certain quarters it is felt that it would be more satisfactory if the Treasury issued a list of stocks which it considered affected by its own order. This was the procedure adopted in the last war. The wide scope of the order has brought in many securities the mobilisation of which could be of no practical value. The overwhelming number of registrations of such a nature that is pouring in has sur- prised the authorities. Compilation of lists is entailing a tremendous amount of work on the part of banks and brokers without serving any useful purpose. BUYING OF OIL SHARES Demand for Oil shares caused a general advance in prices and provided the Stock Exchange with one of its best features yesterday. Interest embraced most of the leading shares but, as in several recent sessions, particular favour was shown to those of the Trinidad companies. An increase in oil consumption is con- sidered by investors to be a likely result of war movements and it is thought that Trinidad, as an Empire field, may take a larger part than in the past in supplying the demand.

   "text_content" : "The omission of dividends on their Pre- ference capitals is announced by the two big London stores-Selfridge and Wil- liam Whiteley. SELFRIDGE AND CO. has decided to make no distribution on its Â£1,300,000 Six per Cent. Cumulative Preference (quoted 11s 3d) or on its Â£1,000,000 Ten per Cent. Cumulative Preferred Ordinary (quoted 6s 3d). Due payment date is 30th September. In its last financial year six months' dividend only was paid on the Preferred Ordinary, but the Six per Cent. Preference dividend has hitherto been paid regularly. WILLIAM WHITELEY WILLIAM WHITELEY is passing dividends due 30th September on the Â£450,000 Five per Cent. Cumulative Preference (quoted 7s 6d) and on the Â£450,000 Twenty-five per Cent. Cumulative Ordinary (quoted 12s 6d). The control company, Selfridges, has guaranteed 25 per cent. per annum on the Ordinary for 15 years as from Febru- ary, 1927. The guarantee ranks before Selfridge's Preference shares, but after its debenture service. Mr. H. Gordon Selfridge is chairman and managing director of both companies. Except Mr. H. W. Jones, all of the White- ley directors are on the Selfridge Board. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 2 PETER ROBINSON PETER ROBINSON has rescinded a pre- vious resolution to pay an interim on the Â£500,000 Ordinary of 1 per cent. An interim of 1 and final of 3, making 4 per cent., was paid for 1938-39. In addition to the Ordinary (quoted 10s) the issued capital consists of Â£475,000 Seven per Cent. Preference (quoted 13s 6%d) and Â£50,000 Preferred. Mr. T. P. Clarkson is chairman."

   "text_content" : "%JAT IAAlt4TL VTAAJL7 The Bank of England rate for the dollai was again fixed yesterday at $4.02-$4.04 It was generally believed that this quota. tion will persist for some time. Some confusion prevailed for a time ovez the announcement by the United States Foreign Committee to the effect that any American demand for dollars would be satisfied in the London market at $4.02, provided the demand was for liquidation of pre-war sterling balances or for current trade transactions with the British Empire. Subsequently, however, this was confirmed in the London market. The buyer of the dollar exchange, pro- vided there is no transgression of the rules, will, of course, be given the neces- sary permission. In these circumstances, the London market was surprised at the fresh weakness of sterling in New York. but competent observers attributed this tc hurried liquidation of sterling balances by foreign holders. These holders are either unable to comply with the regulations or chafe at the delay in securing permission owing to the necessity of filling up forms, They therefore endeavour to sell in some other centre, which, in its turn; will only take that sterling at a ridiculous level because of their difficulties in disposing of it. Hence the rate for sterling in a foreign centre may well drop to a greater extent than is justified by the volume of selling. In New York yesterday sterling opened at $3.75, but rallied and closed at $3.84. It was learned yesterday that an impor- tant discount market amalgamation will be announced shortly.

It has also been arranged that where registrations were effected before the out- break of war for amounts greater than those for which insurance was eventually required, traders will be permitted to pay the premium appropriate to the value of stocks actually held by them on the out- break of war. Stocks may also fluctuate over the three-monthly period during which a policy of insurance is current and in this case premiums will be adjusted so that payment of a premium on amounts greater than the value of the stocks actually held from time to time during the period of insurance will not be required.",
