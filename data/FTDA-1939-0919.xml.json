MONDAY Evening. There were few features of outstand- ing importance in Money market circles to-day, but one of the most interesting was the announcement of the merger between two well-known discount firms, to which reference is made elsewhere. In Lombard Street itself conditions underwent little change. Paper was still in keen demand, but, despite this, discount rates kept fairly steady. Clearing banks were buyers of short-dated paper as hitherto, their rates being 3 per cent. for Octobers, 3Y per cent. for Novembers and 3% per cent. for De- cembers. A keen outside inquiry for \" hot\" Treasury bills was encountered and business was done down to 33Y per cent. Leading houses maintained their buying rate for three months bank drafts at 3% per cent., but the competitive level was under that figure. Short loans were in plentiful supply, and fresh advances were obtainable from outside quarters at 2% per cent. Clearing banks still charged 3 and 3:y per cent. for advances againt bills and bonds respec- tively. LoAS DISCOU.r -P CENTr. PERCENT.

Silver prices continued their advance, with spot '/%d up at 22%sd and forward delivery %d at 22' id. the highest levels since November, 1936. Business was small, there being a shortage of supplies. Dollar Unchanged No changes were made in the official rates posted in London to-day, except that the spread for the Montreal rate was narrowed from $4.42-$4.48 to $4.43- $4.47. The London-New York rate was still called $4.02 to $4.04. French francs were again quoted at 176-177, Dutch guilders at 7.58%, Swiss francs at 17.75, Swedish kronor at 16.90 and Norwegian kroner at 17.65. In the \"so-called\" free market, Italian lire moved sharply in favour of sterling to 75%, but Uruguayan dollars improved to 24d and Peruvian soles to 20.50.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 18th Sept. The Stock Market had its worst setback since the war boom started. Prices at one time went $1 to $6 down, which was attri- buted largely to the market's weak tech- nical position, but a late rally left final quotations generally anything to $3 lower, with losses in war stocks extending to $7. The closing tone was weak. Turnover totalled 1,730,000 shares. The opening was weak, and many lead- ing issues sold off anything to $5 in the initial trading. This selling rush quickly subsided, however, and the volume slackened as later in the morning support lifted many stocks above their lower levels, but at midday a long list was still 1 to 3 points down. In the early after- noon the market was very quiet, with traders extremely cautious, and prices fluctuated at above the day's lows. Much of the realising was ascribed to the vulnerability of the so-called war stocks. Steels were heavy, making no response to this week's fresh jump of 9.1 in mill operations to 79.3 per cent. of capacity, the highest for almost two years. Aircrafts, Coppers and Chemicals were under pressure. Motors were also sold, though underlying consumer demand in the industry continues strong. A late rally failed to attract a following, and the market encountered renewed pressure towards the end. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing aver- age dropped 4.37 to 147.78, Rails 1.26 to 30.81 and Utilities 0.76 to 24.25. Dealings covered 871 stocks, of which 722 fell, only 72 improved and 77 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Governments were easier and Railroads weak; bond sales amounted to $9,340,000. Moody's commodity index (31st Dec., 1931 = 100) was 167.8, against 169.1 on Saturday. The Federal Reserve Board's index of industrial production for August is 102 (1923-25=100), compared with 101 for July, and 88 for August, 1938. Last month's index would have been higher but for the closing down of oil wells, and there has been a sharp further advance in the index for the first half of September. The \" New York Times\" business activity index for the week to 9th Septem- ber is 97.0, against 94.1 for the previous week and 84.5 a year ago. Chesapeake- and Ohio Railroad has ordered 32,000 tons of rails. Douglas Aircraft has received an order for 15 airplanes from American Airlines. The Federal Reserve return for the week to 13th September shows an increase in U.S. Government securities of $229,310,000 to $2,823,720,000; this includes a rise of $86,480,000 by the New York Federal Reserve Bank to $856,150,000. Gold stock increased $82,000,000 during the same week to the new high of $16,808,000,000. Member banks' excess reserves over legal requirements rose $300,000,000 to the fresh peak of $5,270,000,000. Remington Rand net income for second quarter $150,000 ($93,000 year ago), or 81c (50c) per share. AVERAGES AND VOLUME Home Trading Comn- Uses Ho ails Indus.

   "text_content" : "With spirits dampened by the war news and with fresh buying orders few and far between, more members than usual were in critical mood yesterday. The \"big freeze\" in the gilt-edged market was still the main cause of dis- content. But I also heard it argued that the Committee had blundered in urging that as much of the pre-war position as possible should be settled this Thursday, only a fortnight after the payments would have been due in peace-time. Forced Selling ? There was an unexpected resumption of what often looked like forced selling, more particularly of Kaffirs and leading Industrials. Evidently a good many clients wished to improve their liquidity following the receipt of unexpectedly large accounts to be met on Thursday. With his gilt-edged holdings tem- porarily frozen the most prudent pre- war capitalist may be the most awkwardly placed in current conditions. He would prefer as a rule to keep first- class equities-maybe add to them-but if in need of funds has no resource but to sell shares like, say, Imperial Tobacco among Industrials and Crowns or Sub Nigel among Kaffirs. It was very noticeable yesterday that towards the close of the session the fresh fall in shares of the above A.1 classification was attracting a few shrewd bargain- hunters. Maxima v. Minima While markets are awaiting the hoped-for reduction in Bank Rate, dealers are starving. One suggestion I heard yesterday was that to thaw the gilt-edged market maximum daily fluctuations might be enforced in place of minimum dealing prices. It was argued, probably correctly, that to reduce sharply the minimum prices in the Consol market might shake confidence and simply result in a fresh freeze-up at the lower level. On the other hand no definite view of the outlook would be implied by a rule that in any one session no stock should be dealt in more than a point under the lowest marking or a point above the highest marking of the previous day. This method of limiting daily price changes has been applied in the com- modity markets, but there may be objections to applying the syscem to stocks and shares. I should like to hear any comments by readers. Closing-in On London If markets reasonably suited for the flotation of War Loans are to be en- couraged then the sooner any unneces- sary obstacles to domestic dealings are removed the better. Apparently it will not be long, if it is not already the case, before Wall Street will be the only overseas Stock Exchange to which securities can be sold in any volume. Business will gradually close-in upon London and the provinces. Paris Boursiers are forbidden to buy abroad. Even in our dominions Canada has just followed Australia in introduc- ing rigid control of the export of capital. If an arbitrageur wishes to sell International Nickel, or any other Canadian stock, to Montreal he must not only obtain the permission of the Bank of England, but his opposite number must similarly obtain permis- sion from the Canadian Exchange Control Board to pay for the securities. Should the London firm succeed in selling shares to the other side and obtaining payment in Canadian dollars, then these must be handed over to the Bank of England at that institution's official buying rate. Yesterday you would have had to give the Bank 4.47 Canadian dollars for Â£1, although the last rate cabled from the \"black market\" in New York was under 4.30. ht B9tarist",

A strong speculative movement in favour of staple commodities has developed, but the steel market is un- certain. It is considered here that the International Steel Cartel is suspended and that price agreements will no longer be able to be concluded. I understand that the Belgian Govern- ment contemplates entering into im- mediate negotiations with the belligerent nations with a view to regularising its economic relations with them. It is hoped here that exchanges of raw materials (copper, coal and coke) and manufactured steel and textile articles against foodstuffs, mineral ores, cotton, etc., will prove possible, but so far nothing positive has been done.",

   "text_content" : "MONDAY Evening. The Stock Exchange started the week under unfavourable conditions. Russia's invasion of Poland depressed sentiment from the opening. News of the loss of the Courageous prevented any subsequent im- provement. Quotations in all markets, except those in which minima have been fixed, were reduced more or less heavily. Leading Industrials were marked down sharply, and a notable development was a reaction in recently strong sections such as Oil and Shipping securities. The day's turnover was generally reported to have been below the very moderate activity of last week. Trans- actions marked in all sections totalled 2,460, compared with 2,408 on Friday. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial share index fell 4.2 to 84.1. Business in gilt-edged securities was curtailed further by the minimum prices, business at these levels becoming still more difficult. Attempts at exchanges from War Loan into short-dated stocks were impeded by the problem of selling War Loan at the minimum. Nevertheless, Conversion 4/ per cent. marked a good many times between 100% and 101. Corporation and Dominion stocks were left at their minimum quotations, although actual business was often marked at appreciably higher levels. Transactions in New Zealand 4y per cent. 1944 were recorded at 93, against a minimum of 90. Discrepancies of this kind are attribut- able to special factors, such, for example, as a purchase of a security which may be in short supply. Gilt-edged prices Page Four BONDS DECLINE The Foreign bond market was one of the quietest sections and prices conformed to the generally adverse trend of markets. The political developments of the week-end seemed to be interpreted as bear points for Far Eastern issues and Chinese and Japanese bonds suffered setbacks, which in many cases more than offset the improve- ments made at the beginning of the war. Thus the Boxer loan dropped 5 points to 35 and the 4 per cent. 1898 Chinese issue shed 4 points to 45. The 5 per cent. 1912 issue was also 2 points down at 18. The fall in Japanese loans was less pronounced, but equally widespread, and all issues closed from 1 to 1% points lower. Apart from a little marking down of Europeans, there were few other changes. There was no further evidence of buying interest in Argentines, although the prices remained steady and the Chileans sus- tained small losses. Foreign Bond Prices Page Four RAILS HARD TO SELL Business in the Home Rail market suffeged. a further-diminution in-volume, the public remaining sellers on balance. Some jobbers sent out their lists of prior charge stocks with slightly altered margins. The unofficial minimum prices remained unchanged, but the upper quota- tions were slightly lowered. Most stocks remained difficult to sell. There were a number of dealings in L.M.S. 4 per cent. Preference, but in other cases the Official List showed few or no markings. Ordinary stocks also displayed a weak tendency. Great Western dropped 1 point to 23 and L.M.S. and Southern Deferred Ordinary were fractionally lower at 11 and 9. In the Foreign Rail section business was also at a low ebb. The recent buying interest in Argentine and other South American Rails showed no sign of revival and most quotations closed slightly lower. B.A.G.S. were down % to 9 and the 5 per cent. Preference suffered a similar setback to 25. B.A. and Pacific lost % to 4 and Central Argentine 6 per cent. Pre- ference were outstandingly weak with a fall of 4 points to 24. The general weakness permeated the American section, where turnover was greatly reduced, some recent buyers of shipment to New York being out of the market. New York Central fell 2% to 22. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 CHIEF INDUSTRIALS FLAT Pressure to Sell on Market Lacking Ready Buyers Lower levels were general among In- dustrials and in this respect the day was the weakest experienced in this market since the outbreak of hostilities. Senti- ment was influenced unfavourably by the Russian move, but realisations were the riain factor and these persisted in several directions, notably among a few Banking and Insurance shares and in the Brewery section. Many attempts to sell were un- successful, as prices were below levels at which brokers were authorised to deal. In the BANKING group; the really weak spots were few, the outstanding move- ment being a fall of 7s 6d to 52s 6d in Westminster shares. According to re- corded transactions quite a number of bargains passed in Lloyds \"A,\" but the quotation closed only Is lower at 42s 6d. Midland part paid Â£2 10s shares were Y down at 7. Standard of South Africa yielded % to 10 and English Scottish and Australian as to 2%. INSURANCE shares were fractionally easier. Prudential \"A\" changed at 22 and the \" B \" relapsed 6s 6d to 61s. Small sellers of ELECTRICITY securities were still about, but fewer price changes were made. Falls of is 6d apiece oc- curred in Northmet Powers and Midland Counties. Edmundsons changed at 19s and Clyde Valleys at 27s 6d. Ever Readys were inquired for and changed at 22s 9d, but the general dis- position was to sell other .ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT issues. In fact, forced sales continued of Crompton Parkinsons and following on Friday's fall of 2s 3d the price was depressed further 2s 9d to General Electrics dropped s 6d to 63s 9\" Changes were light among COMMUNICA- TIONS, where Cable and Wireless were offered at 44. Sales of MOTOR shares were small. Tillings sold at 32s 6d and left off at 34s with a net loss of Is. Rolls-Royce- and Leylands shed 2s 6d apiece, as did Albions. Morris closed is 8d lower at 26s 3d- having chpaged at 25s 9d. In AIRCRATr, business was done in Hawker Siddeleys down to 9s\"4%d and the shares finished at 10s d, against 11s. d on Friday. .Faireys, after being offered around 14s, closed at 15s. On the advance in the retail prie of cycles Raleigh Holdings were inquired for and rose Is to' 46s, at which there were buyers. IbON and STEEL shares ended with a string of declines quite out of proportion to the amount of selling. In the aggre- gate this was relatively moderate. The * 4 <., principal recessions were 3s 9d to 41s 3d in Babcock and Wilcox and 3s to 25s in John Browns. Vickers, Dorman Longs and Stewarts and Lloyds gave way Is 9d apiece. Radiations were weak on a few efforts to obtain 30s or so for the shares. Realisations depressed Imperial Chemi- cals 2s 9d to 26s 6d and British Oxygens 2s 6d to 75s. British Aluminiums sold down to 55s. A loss of %e to 3V6 occurred in Turner and Newall. COURTAULDS WEAKER Movements were small and mostly against holders among SHIPPING shares. King Lines were firm at 23s 6d xd and France Fenwicks 24s. TEXTILES moved downwards and losses of Is 6d each were shown by J. and P. Coats and Patons and Baldwins. RAYONS also made a poor showing, with Cour- taulds Is 3d-lower at 25s. British Celanese were flat, with the Ordinary 9d lower at 4s and the Second Preference Is down at 8s 9d. American Celanese were firmer. Weakness anew developed in CHAIN STORES issues, mainly because of the heavy expense of the compulsory insur- ance of stocks. Woolworths and Marks and Spencer declined. Fresh declines occurred among BREWERIES on taxation fears, but changes were less severe than thilse of last week. Guinness fell 3s to 75s, rs did Ansells to 55s and Morgans to 50s. Leading TOBACCOS suffered fresh losses, but the fall in Imperials to 4% attracted a few buyers and the price closed at 4'%e; a net loss of % was shown. Carreras \"A\" and Gallahers were tach Y lower. Americans opened below parity, then went better, and as New York advices came over tailed off fr.om best. Bethle- hems were 106, U.S. Steels 89, Nickels 53, Chryslers 103, and General Motors 61%. Industrial Share Pri,:-s Page Four RUBBERS QUIET Rubber share quotations followed prices in other departments. Some small lots were picked up occasionally for invest- ment, but generally shares which came to market were not wanted. Naturally the leaders were the chief sufferers. United Sua Betong were marked down 2s 6d to 47s 6d and Glenshiel receded the same amount to 18s 9d. Anglo-Dutch weakened Is 6d to 26s, Rubber Trust 9d to 27s 6d and Allied Sumatra 7Yd to 15s 10Ad. Rubber shares in Mincing Lane were again very quiet owing to the dulness of the commodity. Rubber Trust were quoted at 27s 6d and Anglo-Dutch 26s 3d. Business in Tea shares on the Stock Ex- change was very slow. Quotations moved irregularly. Empires were in demand and rose from 19s 4%d to 20s and Nedeem were also dearer at 18s l1d. Elsewhere, Scottish Ceylon were sold on occasion and fell 3s 1%d to 35s. The close was dull. Rubber and Tea Prices Page Four VULNERABLE OILS The extent of thei reepnt t dvane l fs. OIL shares particularly vulnerable in the general reactionary movement. Declines were most severe in such favoured stocks as the Trinidad issues and in the more readily marketable of the investment leaders. Shells came back % to 4'%.; and Royal Dutch lost 2% to 40. Anglo-Iranians were %. down at 3',% and Burmahs %' off at 3%.. Outstanding falls among the Trinidad issues occurred in Leaseholds, which de- clined %' to 4'.,, and Apex. which were lowered 2s 3d to 28s. Trinidad Petroleum Developments eased Is to 50s and United British 3d to 8s 9d. Mexican Eagles were 4%d easier at 5s, but other South American 'ssues were relatively steady. V.O.C. shed Vj to 1/% and Lobitos V. only to 1'%.. Anglo- Ecuadorians were 3d off at 18s 6d. Oil prices Page 4 MINES MARKED DOWN Tins Keep Steady on Fresh Output Quota Increase A moderate pressure to sell Kaffirs was again mostly attributed to belated clear- ing-up operations in advance of Thurs- day's Settlement. The week-end news further discouraged demand, and offering consequently soon took its toll of prices. The weakness of some issues for this reason proved sufficient excuse to mark back quotations generally, especially as prices cabled from Johannesburg showed equal depression. Scope for arbitrage oper- ations between the two centres was thus limited, while in any case overseas trans- actions are rendered very difficult by cable delays. West Wits. dropped % to 2% rather sellers, Venterspost %. to 1%i , Western Reefs %' to % and Western Holdings Is 3d to 7s. Marievale fell 6d to 14s. Of the producers, Sub Nigel lost % to 9%, Crown % to 14%, Geduld Y to 7% and City Deep % to 1' /. Most other de- clines in this class of share did not exceed '/r. A number of Finance issues weakened, with Anglo American Corpora- tion %e to the bad at 1%V. Among Diamonds, De Beers Deferred and Preference receded s apiece to 5 and 8 respectively. W. AFRICANS LACK SUPPORT West Africans generally lacked sup- port, although a fair demand for Ashanti was reported, attracted by an early re- lapse that left the shares %. lower on balance at 3%,. Bibiani dropped Is 6d to 26s 3d, Taquah and Abosso Y to 1% and Gold Coast Selection Is to 16s 3d. Of other Gold shares, Globe fell % to 1%. A fair amount of liquidation was encountered in Rhodesian Coppers, pre- sumably in part the cutting of bull commit- ments entered into last week. Rhokana shed % to 12%, \"Rhodesian Anglo- American Is to 23s and Selection Trust Is 3d to 13s. A few buyers nut Tan- ganyika Ordinary up 3d to 4s. ftio Tinto were marked down X to 11%. The news of the still further stepping up, this time to 100 per cent., of the out- put quota for the third quarter of the year sufficed to keep Tin shares fairly steady at last week's advanced levels. A few declines included '. to 1% ex-divi- dend in Malayan and %a to 1% in Mawchi. Bangrin stiffened %, to '%.. In the Lead-Zinc group Zinc Ordinary yielded % to 3%, North Broken Hill %.- to 12%. and South 3d to 21s. Australia was reported to be swapping these issues for West Australian Gold shares.

   "text_content" : "The Russian news spread a subdued air over the markets of the Stock Ex- change. Its effect was emphasised by the official news of the sinking of H.M.S. Courageous. The atmosphere reproduced, in the memory of a good many of us, exactly the same condition that prevailed on certain days during the Great War. Liquidation Liquidation, wherever it breaks out, has so disproportionate an effect upon prices as to make it desirable that there should be as little forced selling as possible. Those who assumed that the selling in the Kaffir market had finished two or three days ago found that they had taken too optimistic a view of the situation, for shares were offered, not exactly with freedom, but sufficiently liberally in yesterday's deal- ings to depress the market as a whole. The Cape merely looked on. Rho- desian Copper shares suffered in sympathy with Kaffirs. In mining groups not usually influenced by South African factors, the tone became heavy in the grey drabness of the current mood. In this will be found the reason for falls which, on the face of them, are neither logical nor necessary. London Banks Prices in the market for Home Banking shares have fallen so con- siderably that at to-day's quotations it is possible to obtain over 5 per cent. from front-rank shares. Barclays Bank \"A,\" for example, of Â£4 each, paying their maximum rate of 10 per cent., yield Â£5 6s 8d per cent. at 7t; Westminster Bank Â£1 shares, fully paid, at 59s, yield 4, per cent. on their maximum dividend of 122 per cent. Among the partly paid shares, National Provincials, of Â£5 each with Â£1 paid, return 59 per cent. and the Â£5 shares with 14s paid, at 38s, give 52 per cent. A similar rate can be obtained from -Midland Bank Â£12 shares, with Â£2 10s paid, at 71. West- minster Bank Â£4 shares, with Â£1 paid, at 62s return Â£5 16s per cent. All these yields, it may be fair to add, are based upon the dividends paid for 1938. Autolunie",

   "text_content" : "The War Risks Cargo Pool has now issued a preliminary notice with regard to the settlement of claims, following a request last week that underwriters should not settle any claims pending official details. It is stated that the documents required to substantiate a claim include both war and marine policies, a statement of the basis of valuation, bills of lading, duly endorsed, invoices, sale contract and certain forms which will be issued shortly. The pool was created to cover the period at the outbreak of war before the Govern- ment Office could commence operations. The war losses already reported must, to a large extent, therefore, come within its scope. Pending an official ruling, Russian vessels are still being regarded in the marine insurance market as \" neutral\" for insurance purposes. This is important, since cargo in belligerent vessels cannot be insured and, under the general schedule applying to cargo not eligible for acceptance by the Government Office, cargo in neutral ships enjoys a rebate of 75 per cent. in the standard rate for voyages north of the equator and 50 per cent. for voyages south of the equator.",

   "text_content" : "Amid the welter of controls and regu- lations two related questions are rising insistently. The first is, how far is the conduct of civilian business compatible with, or even essential to, the conduct of the war? The second is, are our re- strictions framed, as they should be, to allow the maximum freedom consonant with the attainment of the major objec- tive? Neither can be answered with- out qualification, but experience so far shows that present methods leave a good deal to be desired. There can be no doubt that, whether from the point of view of employment and social well- being or from that of national revenue, legitimate enterprise should be inter- fered with as little as possible. Take the case of the impending restriction of petrol consumption. Admittedly Service requirements of the spirit are bound to be enormous, and the bulk of it has to be imported, but account must be taken of the serious repercussions of the pro- posed curtailment. With the prospect of being able to run them perhaps 250 miles or less per month, a great many owners are proposing to lay up their cars at the end of this year. That will mean a heavy loss of revenue at a time when the country is needing more than ever. In his Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer esti- mated receipts of Â£43,450,000 from motor duties, while Â£50,000,000 might be allowed for petrol out of the Â£60,500,000 expected to be derived from duties on oils. Thus it will be seen that a very considerable amount of revenue may be jeopardised, even when allow- ance is made for the cars engaged on defence work, while the effect will spread through garages and manufac- turers of tyres and accessories to income-tax receipts. There is certainly a clear case for treating public utility and business vehicles as generously as is possible, and in these days for various legitimate reasons the motor-car has become the necessity of the many. In the manufacturing and trading sphere, two of the matters giving cause for concern are the continuing partial closure of the Metal Exchange and the burden of commodity insurance. With metal dealings (subject to license) allowed only in tin on the Exchange there is every opportunity to safeguard most effectively the priority of the Government's requirements of base metals. At the same time the market organisation is threatened with disrup- tion under present conditions, while the plight of metal users generally is un- enviable. Taking for granted our con- trol of the seas and consequent ability to replenish stocks, it must be hoped that greater freedom will be accorded before long. As regards insurance of stocks, at its present rate of 6 per cent. per annum, there is every ground for more speedy adjustment of this very real and compulsory burden than seems to be officially envisaged. Fixed with- out any experience to serve as a guide, the rate is a flat one bearing no rela- tion to the degree of risk involved. For many owners, particularly in supposedly safe zones, it takes on the character of a tax rather than an insurance properly so-called, and is likely to have a wide- spread, if varying, effect upon prices and trade.",

The book value has risen from Â£8b8,100 to Â£882,200, but the market value is only up from Â£772,400 to Â£786,300. On a percentage basis the increase in the depreciation is from 4.4 to 10.8 per cent., in round figures from Â£36,000 to Â£96,000. The latter figure is covered by the general reserve, raised from Â£44,400 to Â£100,000 by an appropriation from the profit and loss account. Of course, too much stress should not be laid upon a decline in the value of the portfolio in the present circum- stances, and from the earning point of view the business has made excellent progress. The rise of more than 20 per cent. in net profit shown in the pre- liminary statement accurately reflected the increase in profitability of the business as a whole, for all the profits of the subsidiaries are handed to the parent. The liquid position is excellent, and as a producer of an essential raw- material the company should be strongly placed in war-time.",

   "text_content" : "One of the first fruits of the steps to control exchange put into force by the Australian Commonwealth Government at the end of August is seen in the an- nouncement now made by Goldsbrough Mort and Co. It is stated that, owing to war conditions, the directors have withdrawn their approval of transfers from the Australian to the London register. The company operates on a substantial scale as wool, grain and produce brokers and stock and station agents, with a head office at Melbourne. Like many other overseas companies it normally maintains share registers both in Australia and in this country, with a view to the convenience of shareholders and the marketability of the shares. As a result of measures taken under the Defence Act all overseas exchange transactions came under the control of the Commonwealth Treasurer, and the suspension of share transfers becomes part of the measures to prevent the ex- port of capital. A parallel situation is found in the Statutory Order for Treasury control of securities discussed in these columns in yesterday's issue. Under the new regulations the word \"transfer\" in relation to securities is made to include \"The transfer thereof from one register to another.\" For a different reason the transfer of the shares of Goldsbrough Mort and Co. was suspended some years ago at a time when the big fall took place in the Australian exchange.",

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL With the proposed fusion of Cater and Co. and Brightwen and Co., fore- shadowed here on Saturday and officially announced yesterday, another very important reduction takes place in the number of houses in the discount market. The merging of some of the private firms and companies into larger units is known to be the desire of the authorities. This latest amalgamation has created a favourable impression and the good wishes of Lombard Street are extended to the \" marriage.\" This creates a con- cern second in point of size to the three great discount public companies. Increased Importance The important fusions of the past year or two have been between larger units. Efforts to bring together smaller elements have not yet achieved much success. Other firms have disappeared since 1931 but, in spite of the contraction in numbers, the total capital in the market has increased. This is of importance since a large capital and adequate re- serves are determining factors in business. There still remain, however, market members who believe that personal con- nections will become an active asset again. Exchange Dealings For the first time for several days there were no adjustments to the prin- cipal official foreign exchange quota- tions beyond a narrowing of the spread for the Canadian dollar. The information obtainable points to \" black \" market dealings in sterling, as previously hinted in these notes, having been most modest. Such business has been put through by harassed non-residents who, for some reason, have had their sterling balances blocked or feel that the sanction neces- sary to convert such balances will not be given. It is understood that specu- lators have been most ingenious in wording their applications in an attempt to escape the mesh. It was inevitable that a market abroad should develop, but its existence will doubtless be short, particularly if, as is suggested, the authorities close some of the gaps.",

   "text_content" : "It speaks Well for the popularity of the products of Lines Brothers, makers of \"Tri-ang\" toys, fairy cycles, model aircraft and the like, that the company was able to achieve a new high record in its trading profit in a difficult period. The figure was Â£800 better than in the preceding period at Â£81,200, but the heavier charge for taxation reduced the net profit by Â£2,300 to Â£70,200. Thanks to the larger sum brought in the balance available for distribution is much the same as before at Â£80,000, and the dividend of 30 per cent. can be paid for the third time in succession with a comfortable margin. A sum of Â£5,000 as before is put to reserve, making Â£100,000, and the carry-forward is nearly Â£1,000 higher at Â£24,100. Evidence of a well sustained turn- over is afforded by the balance-sheet. Trade debtors have increased from Â£106,400 to Â£120,000, while stocks are down from Â£269,500 to Â£255,800. The holding in subsidiary companies has been increased during the year, and loans to subsidiaries have been ad- vanced from Â£64,200 to Â£100,200, while cash is rather higher at Â£52,500. The strong position of the company illus- trates the success of its policy of attracting attention by progressive methods and the introduction of new lines.",

   "text_content" : "The \"better spirit of co-operation in the trade \" referred to in the last report of the Cheshire United Salt Company evidently continued in the. past year. In conjunction with the steady rise in prosperity in the latter part of the period ended 30th June, it has led to increase in net profit, as shown in the preliminary statement. from Â£16,700 to Â£21,300. The dividend on the Ordinary shares is being raised from 7J to 10 per cent., and that on the Preferred Ordinary from 12J to 15 per cent. The latter issue is entitled to a 5 per cent. non-cumulative dividend, and to partici- pate rateably with the Ordinary in any distribution on the junior shares. The company has made good progress since the capital reorganisation of 1935. The Ordinary at Is 3d and the Preferred Ordinary at Is 9d yield 8 and 8.5 per cent. respectively. The comr pany's salt is purchased by the managers under contract, and a great part of it is packed under various well- known trade names for domestic use. A recent introduction to the market has been \"Velvasal,\" used for water soften- ing purposes."

   "text_content" : "The decision of Ranks to declare a second Ordinary interim of 12 per cent. and a cash bonus of 3 per cent., making 18 per cent. as compared with 17, sug- gests an improvement in earnings which suffered a slight setback in 1937-88. It also reflects favourably upon the finances of the company, in that the liquid resources may be assumed to be sufficient to meet all the require- ments for expansion likely to be experienced in the immediate future. The 5s Ordinary are priced at 15s 6d cum dividend to yield a shade over 6 per cent. The current distribution is made on the capital as increased by the Ordinary issue of last November. Among the features of the past year has been the acquisition of control of John Green- wood Millers (1934). It is not sur- prising that the meeting has been postponed in view of the important part played by the company in the food defence programme.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT PARIS, 18th Sept. The Bank of France's statement for 7th September showed that the note circu- lation stands at Frs.146,149 millions (Â£826,000,000), against Frs.142.359 mil- lions (Â£804,300,000) on 31st August and Frs.123,135 millions (Â£696,000,000) on 17th August. The last figure represents roughly the average during the preceding four months. Both the increase in circu- lation and the accompanying drop in public and private deposits (Frs.20,239 millions, against Frs.25,684 millions on 17th August) is considered relatively moderate in face of the immense strain now imposed on the nation. As regards the general financing of the war, I understand on the highest authority that the Government intends to avoid inflation as long as possible through taxation and sale of short-term bonds. It is thus hoped that the extra money which the State pours out for the conduct of the war will find its way back to the Treasury. A new decree issued under the Exchange Control Regulations compels the declara- tion of all assets held abroad, including debts and contracts directly or indirectly benefiting by way of interest or revenue accumulating abroad, except property represented by securities deposited in France. Frenchmen are already legally obliged to declare foreign income for tax purposes, but the new law covers all foreign assets belonging to Frenchmen, French corpora- tions and foreign resident corporations. No retroactive fiscal claims will be made if declarations are punctually and fully completed or the assets repatriated. Gold and foreign exchange are declarable by French and foreign resident corporations whether held at home or abroad.",

   "text_content" : "The tin quota has been raised a further 20 per cent. to 100 per cent. for the third quarter, and the Government has pro- hibited dealings above Â£230 a ton. Announcements to this effect preceded the reopening of the London Metal Exchange at noon yesterday for trading in tin. About 450 tons changed hands, the closing prices of standard metal being Â£229 17s 6d middle for cash and Â£229 10s a ton for three months metal (buyers). The decisions announced yesterday reflect the energetic measures for control of supplies and prices which have been taken since the market was closed last Wednesday at the request of the Government. It will be recalled that when, after the outbreak of war, the exchange was re- opened for tin dealings on 6th Septem- ber, the market quickly got out of alignment. This was despite successive increases in the current quarter's export quota from 45 per cent. to 60 per cent. on 1st September and from 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. on 12th September. Chief cause was a flood of buying orders by American consumers, who de- manded prompt tin far in excess of probable requirements. Although the London price for common tin was kept within the Â£230 maximum limit en- visaged by the Buffer Pool, traders with export licenses were able to resell the metal in the United States at a sub- stantial premium. BRAND PREMIUMS Schedule Pending Meanwhile, brand premiums rocketed. English tin was traded in this country at Â£241 a ton; Straits tin at over Â£250. In the U.S., Straits tin-a favourite brand with American consumers-has fetched over Â£300. Under the new regulations resales of common tin at high premiums to the U.S. will be forbidden and brand premiums sharply curtailed. As to the future of brand premiums, the market was com- pletely in the dark yesterday. But the Ministry of Supply is believed to be work- ing out a schedule of premiums, which, it may be supposed, will be well below the level current till recently. It was reported that dealings are to be permitted in English refined tin of 99.75 per cent. purity at Â£231 10s a ton. The quota increase of 20 per cent, to 100 per cent.-the highest since 110 per cent. In 1937-involves a theoretical monthly addition to exports of 3,470 tons to 17.330 tons. The actual increase will certainly be less, as not every country is in a posi- tion to take full advantage of the increase. Perhaps only Malaya and the Dutch East Indies-where there are substantial mine- head stocks-will be able to increase their shipments. The limit of Bolivia's maxi- mum output capacity is believed to be little more than 80 per cent. of standard ton- nage. Empire Malayan producers are known to be considering concerted action to expedite supplies. In his announcement of the third quarter quota increase the Chairman of the Inter- national Committee states that the arrangement for a 60 per cent. quota for the final quarter of 1939 remains un- changed. Dealers expect a further adjust- ment of this quota will be made, though a decision will doubtless be delayed until market requirements can be seen in better perspective.",

   "text_content" : "Manufacturers and retailers of wireless sets have experienced an increased demand for their cheaper lines, more particularly battery sets, since the outbreak of war. Sales of the more expensive sets have been adversely affected, but on balance trade has been brisk. Hire-purchase facilities have been sus- pended in most cases since war started. The position in this regard is under con- sideration in the light of changed condi- tions, and it is thought probable that some arrangement will be made whereby these facilities will again be extended in a some- what modified form. On the manufacturing side some diffi- culty may be experienced in the future from the fact that many of the necessary raw materials are controlled. So far no indication has been given as to the order of priority which will rule for these com- modities, but at the moment most of the largest makers have supplies. Among the principal makers and sup- pliers of radio sets are Electric and Musical Industries, Pye, E. K. Cole, General Electric Company and J. and F. Stone Lighting and Radio. ELECTRIC BATTERY SALES There has been a considerable increase in demand for electric batteries of all kinds since the outbreak of war. No increase in prices has been made by the manufacturers. Nor has any difficulty arisen as to supplies so far as the makers are concerned, although transport has in many instances presented a problem in getting the products to the retailers.",

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange yesterday ex- perienced one of its worst days since the outbreak of hostilities. Quotations in practically all markets were lower. Dealings in the gilt-edged market on the basis of fixed minimum prices be- came still more difficult, although in many market quarters it was recog- nised that there are strong arguments against a lowering of these minima. At the same time the existence of gilt-edged minimum prices is an addi- tional depressing influence in other markets. Severe falls occurred in many leading Industrial shares and recently active sections such as Oil and Ship- ping fell back heavily. MINIMUM PRICES Further drying up of business in the gilt-edged market was evident from the fact that, while \" swapping\" operations from War Loan into short-dated securities were again attempted, the market was in- disposed to take further amounts of the former. The ineffectiveness of the minimum prices is causing some conjecture as to the Government's plan for raising a defence' loan. It is now questioned whether any- thing but a substantial reduction in the Bank Rate would produce a rise in gilt- edged to a level appreciably above the fixed minima. A simple reduction in the minimum prices, it is held, would probably be ineffective in attracting buyers. One theory advanced in support of the present position is that by maintaining minimum prices, even if as a result busi- ness is for the moment discouraged, the market will eventually bring in large institutional purchasers of gilt-edged stocks. Many such purchasers have funds continually accumulating. Once these institutions are ready to make purchases on anything like a normal scale a small reduction in minimum prices might be made the basis of an effective market. But it is recognised that institutional investors may require to know the contents of the Supplementary Budget, and possibly the Government's Defence Loan plans, before coming to decisions on investment policy. INDUSTRIAL INDEX DOWN As a result of yesterday's business prices for most leading Industrials are now elow the levels ruling at the end of August. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial share index yesterday was 84.1, against 88.3 on Friday and 96.6 on 31st August. The outstanding declines yesterday and the falls since 1st September are shown below:- Yesterday's Fall on Fall this SHARE close day month Dunlop ............ 24/ 2/ 3/ Imperial Chem.... 26/6 2/9 3/3 Distillers ......... 75/ 3/ 18/6 John Brown ...... 25/ 3/ 3/3 General Electric 63/9 7/6 11/3 Imperial Tobacco 4'1% 1Y% The heavy falls shown in Distillers and Imperial Tobaccos reflect taxation fears which have affected all Tobacco and Brewery shares. General Electrics have probably been reduced as a result of the difficulty of selling gilt-edged stocks at the fixed minimum prices and the conse- quent offering of Industrial shares of the investment type.",

   "text_content" : "N.Y. TRENDI UPWARD By C. B. ORMEROD As was only to be expected, Wall Street's \"war boom\" slowed down to- wards the end'of last week. Dow Theorists were given an exceptionally good oppor- tunity to participate in one of the most sensational advances in Stock Market history by the refusal of the Dow-Jones Industrial average to penetrate its June low during the anxious days immediately preceding the outbreak of war. Definite hints to this effect were given in my articles of 29th August and 5th September. At their recent highs of 155.92 and 32.85 the Dow-Jones Industrial and Rail averages were within striking distance of their November-January peaks of 158.41 and 34.33, which represent an obvious resistance level. Hesitation and consolidation is only natural after a sensational rise such as that recently experienced. Sooner or later a full one-third to two-thirds correction of the September rise will occur, but so far the averages have not given any warn- ing signals, such as non-confirmation, divergence, or poor volume action. The recent primary bull signal points emphati- cally to still higher prices for American Common stocks after the current period of consolidation. OUTLOOK FOR LONDON The outbreak of war has resulted in sharp price readjustments on the London Stock Exchange. On the last day of trading, prior to the temporary closure, THE FINANCIAL TIMES index of British In- dustrial shares stood at 96.6 and of Home Rails at 41.6. At the end of last week the Industrial and Rail indices had fallen to 88.3 and 40.4. Thus, the year-old \" Munich\" support level of 91.2 has at last been broken. The Home Rail index has not, however, broken its January low of 35.2. Although the railways have been taken over by the Government it is still possible to deal in British Railway stocks. A non-confirma tion, rather similar to that which occurred on the up side in June, has therefore been witnessed. Non-confirmation indicates un- certainty concerning the trend currently in force. The bear market has now lasted for nearly three years and, according to precedent, should be nearing its end. Despite the poor outlook for certain sec- tions of the market, such as fixed-interest securities and the shares of companies dealing with the luxury trades, the current high rate of, business activity would hardly seem to predicate anything in the nature of a collapse in British equities as a whole. Dow Theorists should be on the watch for the formation of a new support level for the Industrial index, probably not too far below present levels.",

The amalgamation of these two private companies of banking and discount agents, foreshadowed in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Saturday, will, it is believed, make the combined undertaking the largest private dis- count concern in London. It will rank next in size to the three discount companies-Alexanders (issued capital Â£1,800,000), National (Â£2,153,335) and Union (Â£2,750,000). This merger of two of the outstanding firms of the market is a further step to- wards the reduction of numbers which is desired by the authorities. CHANGE OF NAME Application will be made to change the name of Cater and Co. to Cater Brightwen and Co. Sir Geoffrey Tritton, Sir Arthur Har- ford and Mr. Edward Hornby, the direc- tors of Brightwen and Co., will join the Board of Cater and Co., of which Mr. John Musker is chairman. The business will be conducted from the present address of Cater and Co., 5, Bishopsgate, E.C.2.

Brightwen and Co. was registered as a private unlimited company in July, 1936. It acquired the business of a firm of the same name established in 1860. Issued capital is Â£500,000. Further reference Money Market Notes Page 2 Col. 2 FOREIGN STOCKS RESTRICTIONS AMENDMENT AWAITED No official reply has been received by jobbers who requested amendments to the list of stocks considered to be affected by the Treasury's restriction on dealings in certain foreign stocks. This list. which was drawn up by the market and not by the Treasury, has already been amended once by the making of certain omissions. It is now claimed that it still includes a number of stocks upon which no dividend or interest is forthcoming, and restriction of which could serve no useful purpose. The sug- gestion to the authorities was that Russian and Mexican securities should be removed in order to eliminate a vast amount of work involved in the filling up of forms. Dealers in the Mining market are now taking it for granted that there is no ground for the restriction in the list of Kaffir shares, Roan Antelope Copper and certain other similar issues. On the other hand, there is an impres- sion in the House that the Canadian Pacific Railway Common stock, a dollar issue, should have been included in the list.",

The scheme is not, as has been stated, one in which payment for losses will be deferred until the end of the war. It is one of insurance in the full sense whereby, in return for the payment of a premium which may be varied in amount from time to time in the light of circumstances, the seller of commodities will receive im- mediate payment of the value of his stocks which may be damaged or destroyed by King's Enemy Risks as soon as his claim has been received and assessed. A seller who has added the rate of premium chargeable for a full year to articles now being sold by him has re- covered a sum which far exceeds the charge appropriate to that for which he has been liable for the insurance of the articles. He has, in fact, already re- covered the full charge (subject to any change in the rate of premium) in respect of all repeat orders supplied from re- plenishments of his stock during the currency of the policy. The addition of any such figure as 6 per cent. to the prices of articles which are frequently turned over during the year is thus an unjustifiable form of profiteering.",

   "text_content" : "By our INDUSTRIAL CORRESPONDENT Exports of British coal are running briskly. The necessary licenses under the new Government regulations have already been granted in considei'able numbers and the fuel is moving for- ward from the ports rapidly. Although no information as to volume or prices will be forthcoming at least for some time and probably not for the duration of the war, it is known that demand for coal for over- seas is high. Prices are showing a small increase over those of recent months, but there has been no great advance such as might have been expected in the circumstances or such as occurred in the last war. The arrangements existing for marketing coal are being used in such a way as to pre- clude any marked rise in quotations. All quotations for overseas business are being made upon an f.o.b. basis, leaving the consignee to arrange his freights and war risk insurance rates. The recent rise in freight rates, which as reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday have in some cases risen 100 per cent. since the out- break of war, is presenting some difficulty. Considerably greater quantities of coal are being sent to France and it is believed that shipments to that country are more than making good any falling off in the demands of certain other markets.",
