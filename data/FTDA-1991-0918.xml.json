   "text_content" : "By Laura Sllber In Belgrade, David Gardner in Brubsels and David Owien in London A :EAAPfiRE, due to start at noon today, was agreed yester- day between the warring Yngo- slav republics of Crotia and Serbia and the federal army, in talks brokered by the Euro- pean Community. Last night, however, in a first sign that the ceasefire might not bold, the Croatian capital of Zagreb was hit by explosions and machinegun fire while air raid alerts sounded. The republic's leaders accused the federal army of launching new attacks, claim- ing that six federal jets had raided a suburb of Zagrebau a television station nearby shortly after signing the accord. The agreement was seen as the last opportunity for Yugo- slavia's factions to negotiate a political solution to the coun- try's worst crisis since the Sec- ond World War. Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary and chairman of the EC-brokered peace conference, warned: \"This country is only days away froln a state of irretriev- abol civil war. On that, at least, there Is no argument.\" Lord Carrlingtn's remarks were issued after intense nego- tiations at Igalo, in the repub- lic of Montenegro, with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, Mr Franjo Tudjman, preiident of Croatia, and Gen- eral Veljko Kadievic, defence minister. General Blajoe Adzic, the federal chief of staff, was also presenit. In a joint declaration, the republics' leaders said: \"We recognise this is the last chance to defuse and stop the present warfare... We are fully conscious of the heavy respon- sibility we share at this crucial moment.\" In the declaration, the lead- ers agreed to a ceasefire moni- tored by EC observers, and the \"instant and simultaneous withdrawal\" of federal army units, as well as Serb and Croat paramilitary forces, from battle zones. The statement also called on all forces \"under our political and military influence\" to dis- arm and demobilise. The fed- eral army will withdraw to bar- racks at the same time as the demobilisation of Croat reserve forces. But last night Mr Tudjman, while expressing guarded opti mism about the truce, said he would not end the seizure of federal bases which triggered the latest round of violence. \"The army is shaken by the blows we gave it in the last days so this is one of the rea- sons they wanted to negoti- ate,\" he said. The declaration was signed as violence engulfed Croatia. Several ceasefires have been signed - and broken - follow- Ihg the first EC-brokered agree- ment in July. Since then, more than 400 people have died in flghting between ethnic Serbs and Croats in Croatia.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay and Roland Rudd WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate, yes- terday launched a Â£703m hos- tile takeover bid for Racal Elec- tronics, the defence and data communications company which Sir Ernest Harrison has chaired for more than 25 years. The all-share offer last night valued each Racal share at 50%'p, but Racal's shares had risen 61/p to 57%p on anticipa- tion that the bid was an open- ing shot that might trigger offers from companies includ- ing General Electric Company, Thorn EMI and BTR. J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank which nor- mally advises Williams, told Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, that it could not work on a hostile bid for Racal because of information it had collated for another client. This means that Schroder had advised either Racal on selling parts of its businesses or another potential bidder. S. G. Warburg is advising Williams on the bid. Williams shares yesterday lost 24p to close at 337p, cut- ting the value of the bid from the original Â£753m. The three-for-20 share offer is the largest hostile bid for a UK company since CIN, the British Coal pension fund bid for Globe Investment Trust last year. It is also one of the larg- est all-share bids ever in the UK, prompting speculation that Williams might later have to sweeten the deal. Mr Rudd said he had no option but to launch a hostile bid for Racal. \"I have met Sir Ernest before. Everything I heard about his reaction to the speculation of a bid from Cable & Wireless [in 1988] led me to believe he was not about to accept a bid from us.\" Racal reacted to the bid, which caught Sir Ernest out of the UK on a business trip, with a terse recommendation to shareholders to take no action. Williams said it had bought Growth waves .............Page 18 Lox .............................. Page 20 A mixed peforw r ....Page 23 London stocks ............Page 42 a 2.8 per cent stake on Monday, the first day that Racal Elec- tronics traded in its new form after the demerger of its 80 per cent stake in Racal Telecom, the operator of Vodafone. Williams has interests in building and DIY and specialist engineering. Its brands include Yale locks and Rawlplug. Mr Rudd said he was most interested in Racal Chubb, the security and locks business which is the new Racal's most profitable division. Acknowl- edging possible competition problems, he said Williams would be prepared to sell Chubb's lock and safe busi- nesses and its own Goodwin locks operation. Advisers to Williams also said it would look seriously at sellinig Racal's loss-making data communications business, which faces stiff competition in the US, and the data network- ing business which links 21 UK government departments. Williams said although it had unused bank lines of Â£600m, it had no desire to increase its gearing beyond the current level of about 30 per cent. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said: \"This is not a silly, low first shot for Racal.\" He added that Williams was not in the business of paying too much for acquisitions. The bid raised questions about whether Williams has the management ability to run the non-Chubb business. Some analysts also questioned whether Williams knew exactly what it was buying. Williams has made only two previous hostile bids, neither of which succeeded. It dropped its bid for McKechnie Brothers in 1986, and a year later nar- rowly failed to win Norcros.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent ROVER GROUP is seeking radical changes in working practices among its 35,000- strong UK workforce to meet increasing competition from Japanese car plants being established in the UK and else- where in Europe. Its proposals effectively chal- lenge the trade unions to agree to reforms granting Rover the same conditions and flexibility that are already being con- ceded to Japanese carmakers. The reform package, \"Rover Tomorrow - The New Deal\", was presented to the compa- ny's eight unions last week and is expected to play a criti- cal role in the UK group's abil- ity to survive in the 1990s. It includes measures to: * create a single status com- pany by ending all remaining distinctions between staff and hourly paid workers; 0 offer job security by remov- ing the threat of compulsory redundancies; 0 remove all remaining job demarcations with full flexibil- ity in w6tk procedures and mobility between jobs and areas; * introduce \"single table bar- gaining\" with one combined negotiating body covering all employees; * place a greater emphasis on teamwork and continuous improvement processes. Rover said it expected to dis- cuss the proposals with the unions over the coming weeks. Union leaders refused to com- ment yesterday, pending con- sultations with the workforce. Rover, the leading UK car- maker, which is owned 80 per cent by British Aerospace and 20 per cent by Honda of Japan, already faces financial pres- sure because of the UK reces- sion and recorded a Â£45m trad- ing loss in the first half of 1991. The Rover initiative comes as Toyota, Japan's leading car maker, is engaged in negotia- tions with five British unions over a single union deal for its Â£840m car assembly and engine plants now under development on two sites at Burnaston, near Derby, and on Deeside. Rover said yesterday that it should be able to benefit from \"the sort of agreements being struck for 'green 'field site' plants\", and that it should \"not be penalised simply for having been established for a long time\". Earlier this month the Trades Union Congress passed a controversial motion con- demning the \"alien approach to trade union organisation\" of some Japanese companies investing in the UK. Continued on Page 20 Background, Page 8 Rover Continued from Page 1 Individual unions are com- peting fiercely to represent workers at the Japanese trans- plants, however, and have lready conceded somae at the nditions, now being sought by Rover, at some existing UK plants such as the IBC Vehicles plant at Luton, alre40 int venture between General otors of the US and Iszu as Japan, and at the Ellesmere Poart assembly plant of Vaux- hall, the UK subsidiary of GIL Mr Rob Meakn, Rover's per- ne director, warned yester- day that the three Japanese canken ssan, obota aad rood, were currently develop -ag a capacity for ore than 5M0 cars a yer tel UK,a level equivalent to Rover's Utge p-ed - I 1dtion",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow MONEY isi ow being printed in the Soviet Union as rapidly as possible. \"The only limit to the money supply in the Soviet Union today 4i the capacity of the money prsoses,\" lrYuri Balagurov, managing director of the money supply department of the State Bank (Gosbank), said yesterday. , For Mr Balagurov, charged with controlling Soviet money supply, there is now nothing to do but carry on printing. \"Nothing much. can be done without political will, and there is at present no political will. We have plenty of good mechanisms, but they are not being applied. The State Bank - whose chairman, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, was reappointed after three days suspension last month for alleged complicity with the coup - has, says Mr Balagurov, lost almost all control of money. Wages have risen to nearly double their last year's level by August while expenditure has risen by 169 per cent; wages are expected to rise still further (to 212 per cent of last year's level) by the year end. The two state mints and two money printing centres are working on three shifts round the clock. There are no reserves of newly printed cash: US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bhady yestray accused the I M O U its feet In laiuiMm Bt in the bureaucratic nertia ...it's the most i 'portant event in the last 100 years and...we still haven't got started.\" Mr Brady was on his way to Moscow for talks with Mr GOQachev and Mr YoltsLn. A I. tea tIs in ,Moscow trying to work out how the special association status with the IMF wouldiwork. republics are merely notified which days' production they can collect, literally hot from the presses. The process of uncontrolled printing is fuelled by steadily rising wages unmatched by extra production (which is falling in most sectors). Enterprises borrow from commercial banks to meet their wage bills; commercial banks demand extra cash from the republican central banks, who in turn demand more from Gosbank, which has no choice but to meet their demands. The bank, says Mr Balagurov, has called for a wages and prices freeze no less than five times - though he doubts if the present authorities could make either stick.

All republics, \"driven by a desire to be popular\", are now passing on the price of their popuarty direct to the State Nk. Mr Balagurov said that when, earlier this year, the authorities in Uzbekistan decided to raise the price paid by the state to the cotton farmers from 20 to 44 kopecks per kilo, they merely sent an official to Moscow to ask the State Bank for double the supply of roubles. Mr Balagurov said he had suggested the authorities organise the sale of commodities nearer to the cotton fields in order to keep the money in circulation - but doubted they had done so. \"In this country, there is almost no understanding of the elementary laws of economics. When people in power decided on a project, they just told us, 'get the money for it'. These habits persist.\" \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t GEORGLAN oppositiona eadei Gra Chanturia (above) addInI a ranlly T'lli an hour before he and two oMte opponents of President Zvid Gmak- hurdia were arrested, Reuter reports from Tbilisi.

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson in Moscow DEFENCE lawyers for the men accused of plotting the Soviet coup took the unprecedented and extremely brave step yes- terday of calling a press con- ference to complain that their defendants were being sub- jected to a trial by media. In an act of laudable democ cratic intent largely lost on a pack of agitated Soviet report- ers jamming a room in Moscow's House of Journal- ists, the five lawyers strove, with punctilious professional regard for the Soviet equiva- lent of sub judice, to counter what they saw as a media cam- paign of leaks and lies. \"The mass media is creating a psychosis against our defen- dants,\" said Mr Yuri Ivanov, lawyer for Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former KGB chief, professing particular pique that a journalist had managed to interview his cli- ent 10 days before he could. A plea from the press confer- ence's moderator to \"be kind to our guests\" won no mercy from the Soviet reporters. \"Well, did they do it or didn't they?\" asked one reporter. \"Who is paying your fees?\" asked another. Then one particularly fierce woman reporter, getting neatly to the point, demanded: \"Do you want to go down in history ans the men who let off the putch- ists?\" \"That is rather a spicy question,\" replied Mr Alexei Kologanov, who is defending Mr Vladimir Pavlov, former prime minister. \"If the accused is not guilty and acquitted, the defence lawyer should see it as a great success.\" The lawyers' point was that the trial of the 14 men so far charged with high treason under article 64 of the Russian criminal code, and for which the penalty could be death, must be conducted with due process if democracy is to win its full place in the residual Soviet Union. So far, the law- yers said, the process was proving imperfect. hey com- plained that while they had signed a document preventing them from disclosing evidence amassed during the pre-trial investigation, the Russian prosecutor's office had not, and leaks were appearing in the press. They also complained of not being allowed proper access to their clients nor to material being amassed by the prosecu- tor - a process expected to take up to two more months before the trial is convened. Nevertheless, the outline of their lawyers' line of defence became apparent yesterday. The detained 14, of which 10 have pleaded not guilty, one has confessed and three have pleaded \"partially guilty\", stand accused of high treason against \"the Motherland\", for which the lawyers claimed there is no definition in law. Furthermore, to prove trea- son under current Soviet law, it must be shown that the men acted to undermine the integ- rity of the Soviet Union, impede the development of communism and seek to restore capitalism. With luck, and no little irony, the fact that this is what has happened may give them a fairer trial than they might have expected.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn BUILDERS yesterday reported a 31 per cent surge in orders from eastern Germany during August, providing more evi- dence to support government optimism about economic pros- pects. The increase, following a rise of 15 per cent in July, stems from the need to rebuild and modernise east Germany's dilapidated housing. One in seven of the region's 7m dwellings is officially unin- habitable, 25 per cent have no bath or shower, and 2m have outside lavatories. Some 60 per cent of the housing stock dates from before the Second World War, compared with only 30 per cent in the west. The confederation of con- struction companies, HDB, says it expects orders worth DM90bn (Â£30ba) a year for the next five years. Mr Jiirgen M61- lemann, economics minister, said last week that 10 per cent growth in the construction industry in the east next year was \"wholly realistic\". The government is eager to press ahead with improving living conditions in the east, mainly to stem the flow of pec ple westwards in search of bet- ter jobs and homes. Mrs Ingrid Adam- Schwaetzer, building minister, is planning to build 100,000 homes a year until the turn of the century, and to encourage tenants to buy their homes. Earnings from the sales would help finance building and mod ernisation. The Leipzig housing author- ity, with 150,000 houses and flats on its books, has announced plans to sell 10,000 before 1994. In Frohburg in Saxony, 400 council homes are on the market at a standard rate of DM850 per square metre: about Â£15,000 for an average apartment. Tenants, however, are reluc- tant to buy them until they are modernised. Official estimates put the cost of the cheapest conversion at about DM500 per square metre: Â£10,000 per home. The German building indus- try is already loaded with orders from the west. A hous- ing construction boom has been running for two years since a census discovered that the former Federal Republic needed Im new homes. In the first three months of this year, 25,600 new houses and apartments were com- pleted in the west - 8 per cent more than in the first quarter of 1990. Building costs rose an estimated 7 per cent in the same period. * Lufthansa, the German national airline, has agreed a 4.1 per cent pay increase for its staff. The one-year deal takes effect on October 1.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Protests over Dutch Welfare Reform Plan",
   "text_content" : "By Ronald Van De Krol in Amsterdam THE Dutch government unveiled its 1992 budget yester- day as unions staged strikes in protest at plans for far-reach- ai welfare changes. Public transport in cities such as Amsterdam, Utrecht and Rotterdam was halted while Queen Beatrix read out the government's speech in the Hall of Knights in The Hague. Tens of thousands of work- era in the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam and at hospi- tais, universities, post offices and companies across the country stopped work for sev- eral hours to watch the pro- ceedings on television. The protests were against govemntent efforts to rein in theltunaway growth of the dis- Ability benefits scheme, one of the mainstays of the Dutch welfare state. Currently, for every person in employment, another is drawing some form of state beneflt (including old-age pen- sions) accounting for the Netherlands' high burden of taxes and social premiums. To reduce state spending, the government announced in uly plans to alter the disabL- ty t1 alMehme, a soca-- Curuy programme which hs swollen over the years to cover nearly In people in a country of fewer than 15m. The scheme covers not only victims of industrial accidents but also people suffering from stress as a result of conflicts at work or personal problems. Because disability benefits have traditionally been far more generous than unemploy- ment benefit, employees and employers alike have used the scheme, known by its Dutch initials WAO, to soften the blow of unemployment. The proposed changes - which limit the number of years of entitlement - led to a storm of protest, culminating in yesterday's strikes. The WAO controversy is par- ticularly troublesome for Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister who is also leader of the Labour Party, which rules in coalition with the Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. The budget itself contained few surprises. As expected, the centreleft government said it wouM cut its budget deficit to 4.25 per cent of net national income in 1992 from a proj- ected 4.75 per cent in 1991. But it noted that economic conditions were worsening, with growth forecast to slow to 1 per cent in 199 from around 2S per cent this year.",

Mr Jacques de Larosibre told the annual meeting of the Ger- man Savings Banks' Associa- tion in Bonn it was essential the burden of anti-inflationary policy be shared by monetary policy and control over the budget deficit. \"There would be risks for Europe, \"if Germany were to deepen its budget deficit for any length of time in order to finance the social and eco- nomic costs of unification.\" His warning on German inflation underlines the con- verse fear that the costs of Ger- man unification could have a destabilising effect on the Com- munity's monetary system. Mr de Larosiere said the D-Mark should cease to play its role as the benchmark for the European Monetary System. \"The operation of the EMS has highlighted the notion of an anchor which is essential for encouraging conver- gence...Even though the D-Mark has brilliantly fulfifled this role over a lo period, it is time to make the anchor even more effective by observ- ing that there is now a collee- tive anchor made up of the group of currencies with the lowest Inflation.\"",

   "article_dc_title" : "Europe Split over Role in Yugoslavia",
   "text_content" : "By Robert Mauthnr, Diplomatic Editor in London and Quntin Peel in Bonn THE Dutch plan to use the nine-nation Western European Union as the vehicle for a peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia could do more to underline the differences between the member states than to unite them in joint action. Well before tomorrow's meeting in the Hague of for- eign ministers of the member countries, all of whom also belong to the European Com- munity, it has become obvious that there are deep differences between them on the role the EC and the WEU should pJay in the crisis. The chances of bridging the gap in the Hague depend very much on whether yesterday's cease-fire holds. Of all the EC member states, Germany enjoys the most remarkable degree of consen- sus about its sympathies in the Yugoslav conflict and has taken the clearest stand on the role that the EC should adopt. The great majority of Germans backs the independence aspira- tions of Croatia and Slovenia. At one end of the political spectrum, the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) and their allies do not hide their sympa- thy for their Catholic fellow-be- lievers in Croatia. At the other end, the Social Democrats (SDP) have supported the same side for humanitarian reasons, though they have publicly opposed sending a peace-keep- ing force. Yet German observers believe there is little historical memory in their national response. \"The Second World War is virtually forgotten,\" says Dr Jochen Thies of the German Foreign Policy Associ- ation. \"The Croatian fascist alliance is forgotten and so is the British alliance with Tito and the British role in creating the Yugoslav state.\" Above all, there is wide- spread frustration in Germany at the inability of the EC to take a firm and united stand against greater Serbian nation- alism. This feeling is com- pounded by a growing fear that any split in the Community will be extremely damaging at the very time when much closer political and foreign pol- icy integration is being negoti- ated. At the same time, the Ger- man position has been greatly weakened by the fact that, while it wants a force sent, it claims that it is constitution- ally debarred from contribut- ing men to such an operation, as it did in the Gulf war. The patent inconsistency in the position of Mr Hans-Diet- rich Genscher, the foreign min- ister, has been the subject of intense irritation in other capi- tals, particularly London. \"If the Germans do not intend to participate [in the proposed WEU force], they would do bet- ter to shut up,\" one senior Brit- ish official said. While the Italians, after a complete turnaround in their position, have finally come out in favour of the WEU proposal, serious doubts are being expressed both in London and Paris about the advisability of sending a European force to Yugoslavia at all at this stage. The French are clearly torn between their conviction that such a peacekeeping role would be more effectively assumed by the United Nations than by the WEU, and their desire to promote a \"European defence identity\". But France shares the British insistence that a number of basic condi- tions have to be fulfilled first. These, in the British view, are that a cease-fire has to be in place and must be seen to be working, that all the parties in the conflict, including Irregu- lar forces and the federal army, should agree to the deployient of a WEU force, and that it must be clear to all parties that such a step is likely to contrib- ute to a solution of Yugoslav- ia's fundamental problems. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, has not ruled out the despatch of a European force for all time. But it is highly unlikely that he will go as far as committing himself to a step with such far-reaching political and military implica- tions at the Hague meeting. Even Mr Willem van Beke- len, the WEU secretary- general, and an enthusiastic advocate of an enhanced defence role for Europe, has adopted a noticeably cautious attitude towards the proposal. In view of all the dificulties and disagreements, over- ambi- tious ideas of sending a 30,00- strong force have been greatly watered down over the last 48 hours. The most that can be expected at the moment is a decision in principle to give the 400 to 500 EC cease-fire monitors protection involving no more than a few thousand lightly-armed military person- nel. Yet even such a modest step might prove too difficult for some to swallow.

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent MILITARY experts with experience of peacekeeping missions have serious reserva- tions about proposals to use European troops to enforce a ceasefire in Yugoslavia. The example of UN peace- keeping forces was cited by Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, as a possible model. But UN operations have been relatively limited in their ambition and scale, focusing on monitoring agreed cease- fires rather than imposing peace on warring forces. Except for attacks suffered in Lebanon, UN forces have generally managed to avoid becoming targets, and have had few casualties. But other examples of outside interven- tion show how easy it is for would-be neutral forces to slide into a conflict. Complex questions would first have to be resolved about the kind and size of force required, its composition, its rules of engagement and - thorniest of all - the defini- tion of its role. British officers reckon that to stand between the rival armies and paramilitaries in Yugoslavia would require a force of at least tens of thou- sands, backed up by surveil- lance aircraft and helicopters. But its task - which after a ceasefire would be to prevent local friction flaring up into a renewed conflict - would be greatly complicated by the lack of a clear territorial dividing line. There is concern that, even if a ceasefire is established between the \"overt\" forces (federal and republic armies), the conflict could degenerate into a guerrilla qr terrorist campaign. The nine-nation Western European Union has no experi- ence of peacekeeping. The nearest it has come has been joint minesweeping operations in the Gulf, frst organised under its aegis in 1988. It will need to establish which countries are prepared to send forces, and much are acceptable to the authorities and populations concerned. Troops sent there risk becom- ing rapidly perceived as parti- san, or as hostile occupiers. Although the Dutch propoal foresees \"lightly-armed troops\", if they became a target they cold face quite sophisti- cited weapons British caution is rooted in bitter experience of Northern Ireland. In 1969, the reason for deploying troops in Belfast and Londonderry and sending rein- forcements was to separate warring factions. Soldiers saw themselves as protecting the Catholic population. But within months resentment built up among Catholics, suc- cessfully exploited by the IRA. The army found itself caught uncomfortably between peace enforcement, acting as back-up policemen and fighting an anti- terrorist war, and is still there 22 years later. The UN has covered a range of roles with civilian observers, military observers and lightly- equipped peacekeeping forces. But, partly because it lacked the organisation or the money to do more, it has kept to situa- tions where a modest force sus- ficed and where it could remain above any conflict. UN peacekeeping forces won the Nobel peace prize in 1988, the year observer forces were set up in Afghanistan and along the Iran-Iraq border. Since then there has been the successful UN Transition Assistance Group in Namibia in 1989-90, involving almost 8,000 civilians, soldiers and policemen, and the 16-nation UN Mission for the Referen- dum in the Western Sahara which started to deploy this month. Non-UN initiatives have had much patchier success. The difficulties of containing ethnic conflict were shown up by the Indian peacekeeping force sent to Sri Lanka in 1987, which at one point numbered 70,000 but which pulled out after 2% years. In Liberia, the Nigerian-led Ecomog force - the \"monitor- ing group\" sent by the Eco- nomic Community of West African States last year - soon found itself in effect a party to the conflict, fighting against rebel leader Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Forces of Liberia. For the military, perhaps the main worry, based on previous peacekeepng operations, Is the difficulty forces have in extri- eating themselves. Apart from long standing observer groups, which are relatively easy to maintain, the UN Peacekeep- ing Force In Cyprus (UNFI- CYP) has been there since 196 and the UN Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) - note the word \"interim\" - imce 198",

   "article_dc_title" : "Naval Blockade Raises Doubts about Oil Supplies",
   "text_content" : "By Anthony Roblnson in London and Nicholas Denton in Budapest THE naval blockade imposed on Croatia's seven main ports early yesterday tightened the noose around what was once the most prosperous part of the republic and deepened Hungar- ian and Czechosovak concern about the security of their oil supplies. Hours after the blockade was imposed naval forces took part in a combined naval-army attack on the port city of Sibenik, the first such co-ordi- nated attack by the two ser- vices since fighting began three months ago, while Croat radio said 10 warships had put federal troops and equipment ashore at Split, another scene of fierce fighting yesterday. Well before the Yugoslav fed- eral navy imposed its blockade on Croatia's ports, however, the severing of economic links inside the country during three months of civil war had already reduced their hinter- land to little more than the narrow coastal strip. One exception used to be oil. But an 80,000-ton shipment of crude oil destined for Czecho- slovakia remained trapped yes- terday after Croat authorities lost control of a section of the Adria pipeline which carries 10m tons of oil a year from a pumping station on the island of Krk, south of Rijeka, north to refineries in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Croatia said it could no lon- ger guarantee oil supplies through its territory on Mon- day when Serbian units report- edly seized five pumping sta- tions at Sisak, close to Zagreb. Railways from the ports have not been functioning for weeks while road blocks on the main route between Belgrade and Zagreb have forced most international road freight traf- sic to seek alternative routes through Hungary. Port life has also been hard hit by the collapse of tourism, which used to sustain a busy ferry traffic to and from the villages and ports on this island-studded coastline, which was dominated for centuries by Venice. By imposing a ban on all ships entering or leaving the ports of Split, Pula, Rijeka, Zadar, Sibenik, Ploce and Dub- rovnik the federal army stepped up its pressure on Croatia, only hours before Lord Carrington, the former UK for- eign secretary began his talks with Serb, Croat and Yugoslav federal leaders a few miles fur- ther down the coast at Igalo, in Montenegro. Western diplomats believe the decision to impose a naval blockade was partly an addi- tional \"tit for tat\" response to Croatia's earlier decision to cut off oil supplies to Serbia. But military analysts point out that imposition of the blockade would complicate future arms supplies to Croa- tia. Above all, the blockade underlines Serbia's demand for access to the sea in any futufe territorial negotiations. High on Belgrade's agenda would be the incorporation of Serb enclaves such as Knin, an important railway junction behind the three main ports of Zadar, Sibenik and Split. Three of the seven blockaded ports - Split, Pula and Sibenik - are also naval ports; other naval facilities are at Kardel- jevo and Kotor. Between them the five naval bases are home to a mainly coastal defence and patrol force of five submarines, four frigates and 59 fast patrol and coastal combat ships. In purely military terms the small boats now guarding the entrances to the Croatian ports have a mainly symbolic impor- tance. But several of the port cities have already suffered aerial bombardments and air force intimidation and are swollen by refugees. For them, the grey ships riding outside the harbours are the latest demonstration of Serb steel.",

   "text_content" : "By John Murray Brown in Ankara IRAQI KURDISH leaders met President Turgut Ozal of Turkey yes- terday as part of urgent efforts to secure continued allied sup- port - amid suggestions that west- ern forces now based in Turkey to deter aggression by Baghdad may soon be withdrawn. The delegation, headed by Mr Jalal Talabani, is anxious to win food and medical aid from Ankara in the event of an allied withdrawal. Western diplomats say no decision has yet been made about extending the three-month Operation Poised Hammer, the allies' air and ground presence in Silopi 10 miles from the Iraqi border to deter Iraq aggression. But the accord is due for review at the end of this month and senior diplomats in Ankara say the US and other allied forces are likely to pull out the 4,600 ground troops while maintaining an air strike threat at the joint US base at Incirlik, 310 miles from the IraWi border. Ankara yesterday announced its bilateral defence and economic cooperation agreement with the US had been extended another year, which would provide the legal base for the Incirlik base. But concern is increasing among the Turkish mili- tary at the presence of allied troops on its soil outside the scope of the accord with Washington. Turkey, although anxious to pre- vent another Massive refugee influx, has political reservations about the allied presence, particularly with The GuIfwar and subsequent allied relief effort has exposed the harshness of Turkey's policy towards its own 10m Kurds. The Turkish military is embroiled in a stu against separatists of the Kurdish Workers Party, who since the end of the Gulf war have used power vacuum in north Iraq to mount attacks on Turkish army posts. With general elections set for October 20, the authorities are brac- ing for possible unrest in the region. Mr Talabani's group met an EC delegation on Monday and is due to set out today for European capital and Washington. The Kudh lead- ership is split over whether tp agree terms of a draft accord with Bagh- dad, which would provide limited regional autonomy for the 3.5m Kurds of North Iraq. The draft covers the autonomy issue, the normalisation of Iraqi Kur- distan and Baghda's proposals for political and constitutional reform. However Mr Talabani is holding out for the oil-rich province of Kirkuk to be included in any autonomous region.",

   "text_content" : "By Wllllam Keeling THE International Monetary Fund has failed to grant the Nigerian government approval of its economic policy under a mid-term review of a 15-month agreement signed last January, western diplomats have said. An IMF deal is critical to fur- ther negotiations between Nigeria and its creditors on the country's $35bn (Â£21bn) inter- national debt. The current agreement with the Paris Club of creditor countries to which Nigeria owes $17.5bn is due to expire early next year, and the government is still negotiating to buy back up to 60 per cent of the $5.8bn debt owed to com- mercial banks. The diplomats say that four months of talks between the IMF and the government have failed to break a deadlock over higher than agreed domestic expenditure. As one diplomat said, \"the core of the problem is that the government has resorted to creating money to fund its expenditure pro- gramme\". Bankers in Lagos say the federal government has contin- ued a trend set in January and February when it borrowed more than 12bn nairas (Â£650m) by issuing treasury bills. The bankers report that most gov- ernment borrowing has been used to repay internal debts, leading to a substantial increase in domestic money supply. In addition, bankers say the Central Bank of Nigeria has subscribed to about 40 per cent of treasury bill issues. This has fuelled inflation which bankers currently put at more than 20 per cent, up from less than 10 per cent at the end of last year. Of particular concern to the IMF, diplomats confirm, has been the expenditure of the 30 state governments. State gov- ernments announced substan- tial increases in their annual budgets in January, and the problem has been compounded by nine new states being cre- ated last month. Western diplomats have also expressed concern at expendi- ture on two big projects, in steel and aluminium, which they say should be scrapped, and a contract to purchase 150 tanks from Vickers of the UK. The diplomats say that excessive domestic expenditure has been mirrored by higher than expected international debt-service payments and lower than forecast oil prices. Export of crude oil provides about 95 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings. Nigeria's agreement in Janu- ary with the Paris Club for the rescheduling and servicing of debt was based on a projected oil price of $23, they say. This has not materialised and Nigeria's scheduled debt ser- vice payments are proving unexpectedly onerous.",

   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagatyl in Tokyo JAPANESE politicians usually do their dirty work in private. But the enemies of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister, have no qualms about turning on him in public. Even though Mr Kaifu's term does not end for another six weeks, the fight for the suc- cession is underway in earnest. Mr Kaifu was put into office as a figurehead prime minister by the ruling Liberal Demo- cratic party's largest faction, whose de facto leader is Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister. Mr Takeshita, who wields power behind the scenes, has been so pleased with the arrangement that he is considering putting Mr Kaifu forward for a second term. Other faction leaders are determined to ensure Mr Tak- eshita will not get away with it. So they are making increas- ingly outspoken attacks on Mr Kaifu in order to force Mr Tak- eshita into the open. In the latest incident, an inadvertent remark by Mr Kaifu about US politicians lacking political ethics has been blown out of all propor- tion by his enemies. The offending words slipped out in parliament last Friday when the prime minister was speaking in a debate about political reform proposals, including plans to replace Japan's multi-member constit- uencies with single-seat ones. An MP challenged the idea, saying that in the US single- member districts encouraged representatives to pursue nar- row local interests. Mr Kaifu answered that American politi- cians seemed to lack a strong sense of ethics. They were not supposed to spend large amounts of money on electoral expenses but many of them did, he said. ruer (left), Nato secretary-general, with Taro Nakayama, Japan's fore 4 on Japan to play a positive role in international peacekeeping duri~ 1 minister, in Tokyo last night. ?)1 the First visit by a head of Nato. Mr Kaifu was forced t( retract his remarks in a state ment made to a hastily-callec press conference in the earl3 hours of Saturday. Yesterday he apologised in person befon parliament, saying he regrettec his comments. One of his fev supporters, Mr Sadatosh Ozato, the labour minister said he was concerned aboui how prominently newspapern had displayed stories about Mr Kaifu's comments. But Mr Kaifu's enemies are unlikely to let the incident fade. Chief among them is Mr Michio Watanabe, a faction leader, who makes no bones about his own ambition to become prime minister. In a newspaper interview last week, Mr Watanabe said Mr Kaifu was not the right man to deal with crises like the Gulf war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. \"Kaifu should Dnish up and do what he can, Then, for his own sake and the sake of the country wouldn't it be better if we had another leader,\" said Mr Watanabe. He suggested that Mr Kaifu's public popularity - his opinion poll standing is high -should not guarantee his staying in office. \"Public opinion is important but I don't think pol- itics based solely on public opinion is a good idea.\" Mr Watanabe's comments follow similar attacks from other faction leaders compai ing Mr Kaifu to a \"relief pitcher\" sent in to play for Japan at a time when his inex- perience and lack of abilities is being fully exposed.",

   "text_content" : "Patti Waldmeir on how white business brokered a surprising peace FTER FIVE years of war and 2,500 deaths, there is peace in Mpu- malanga. That, in itself, is odd enough: for until a year ago, murder was a daily reality in this township of 200,000 people, where fire-bombed houses cling to the steep hillsides of South Africa's KwaZulu black \"homeland\". But what makes the Mpuma- langa peace odder still is the fact that it was arranged largely by local white business- men. For doing business in the new South Africa increasingly means taking an active role in politics. On a local level, that can involve separating warring black factions, and nudging. them towards peace: chairing meetings between rivals, inter- vening with the police, provid- ing community development funds. Nationally, business (which is overwhelmingly white) has played an even more promi- nent role. Jointly with the churches, businessmen have brokered a peace deal between South Aica's three main bel- ligerents: the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, the African National Congress and the gov- ernment. With its frank com- mitment to liberal values ad freedoms, the aoord holds out the best hope yet of a tolerant and democratic post-aparthid South Afric Time will t whedther the toplevel act signed lbt week- end by those three and other political groups will be respected in the torture town- ships of Natal.

The Natal Chamber of Industry estimates that two violence-re lated work stayaways in April and July 1990 alone cost the province some R200m (Â£41m) in lost production. The fact that white business was called on to mediate in black conflict is one of the iro nies of the new South Africa, for Hammarsdale's industries are a monument to the grand design of apartheid. They were set up, as apartheid decreed, on the border between white South Africa and black Kwa. Zulu; the aim was to keep blacks out of South Africa, by providing work for them near their tribal homelands. None the less, the blacks of Mpumalanga turned to whites because they had the resources to facilitate a deal, had influ- ence with the po'ice - and because white business was the closest thing to a neutral party in the conflict So Hammaradale's industri- alists went into the township and collected black leader from both sides.

This is the first time that such action has been taken against a foreign bank in South Korea. The Office of Bank Supervision said it was conducting investigations into the foreign exchange dealings of other foreign banks in Seoul. A statement by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea, the central bank, said that the Seoul branch of the French bank had made profits of about Won61.1bn (Â£50m) through foreign exchange deal- ings with other Asian branches and had lent the proceeds to Korean companies. According to the Office of Bank Supervision, the dealings breached regulations which control the flows of foreign exchange into Korea. Mr Jean Mallet, Seoul branch manager of Banque Indosuez, said last week that \"in conducting the transactions in question the bank was not aware that the Bank of Korea objected to these transactions\".",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Feoter in Hong Kong THE UNITED Democrats, the pro-democracy party which dominated Sunday's first direct elections in Hong Kong, has stepped up demands for a say in governing the colony and will today deliver to Sir David Wilson, the governor, a list of about 20 people it wants selected for the Legislative Council. The governor has in his gift 17 appointed seats on the coun- cil. The appointments, which he will make within the next two weeks, will decide the bal- ance of power in the 60-seat chamber and could be used to counteract the pro-democracy movement, which now controls about 20 seats. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the party, met Sir David yesterday and discussed the appoint- ments. He also demanded that United Democrats should sit on the Executive Council, the most senior decision-making body, similar to a cabinet. Mr Lee said the governor agreed to consider his nomina- tions, who are mainly liberal- minded academics and profes- sionals. But Mr Lee was unhappy because the governor did not agree to make appoint- ments in proportion to the Democrats' landslide victory. The Democrats are trying to use the momentum generated by the victory to gain influence and push through policies to address social issues and demand more democracy. If the Democrats' demands are accepted, which is thought unlikely, the party would emerge with a majority in the council, which debates govern- ment policy and approves finances. The government may try to defuse the affair and compromise by appointing a few liberals to the council. The United Democrats and related liberal candidates won 15 of 18 seats contested in the direct elections. One indepen- dent will support the party's call for more democracy, as will four elected indirectly. * Hong Kong and Vietnam have agreed to resume direct scheduled air services.

   "text_content" : "By George Graham and Alan Friedman in Washington THE US Fed- Seral Reserve j Board yester- day announced a $37m (Â£21.8m) fine against Mr Ghaith Phar- son, the Saudi Arabian sinan- cier, for acting as a front for Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the US, and won a freeze on his US assets from a New York court. The Fed charged that Mr Pharaon - who held a per- sonal shareholding in BCCI that reached a level of 15 per cent during the 1980s - had violated banking laws by act- ing as a covert agent for BCCI in the illegal purchase of Inde- pendence Bank of California in 1985, and had made several false declarations to conceal independence's true owner- ship. The US central bank assessed a $200m fine against BCCI in July over what it charges was the illegal take- )ver of First American Bank- shares, the Washington DC 3ank holding company. At the same time, it took steps to iave Mr Pharaon and eight ther BCCI executives and nvestors barred from US bank- ng. The Federal Reserve action igainst Mr Pharaon is not the rnly legal claim he faces. On donday Independence Bank led a $42m federal racketeer- ng lawsuit against Mr Phar ion, charging that he and Mr (emal Shoaib, former chair- nan of Independence, acted as 3CCI front men. Both Mr Pharaon and Mr hoaib are under investigation )y BCCI prosecutors in New (ork. Mr Pharaon is also being nvestigated with respect to his hareholding ties to the 4ational Bank of Georgia in ktlanta and Centrust, the Ailed savings and loan in diami - both have been Lescribed as secretly owned by CCI. Mr Shoaib, according to US nvestigators, was recently riven permission to open a new bank in Pakistan. Investi- gators are also examining whether Mr Shoaib had any ties to Mr Clark Clifford, the former chairman of First American Bankshares, another bank said by the Federal Reserve to have been con- trolled by BCCL In a statement yesterday the Fed said it had delayed assess- ing fines against these eight - who include Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, BCCI's founder and president, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its chief executive - until the Justice Department had completed its criminal investigations. The Fed decided to move against Mr Pharaon, however, because it discovered that he had begun to sell off his US assets, which include a man- sion in Georgia and a stake in a US insurance company, as well as property and oil invest- ments. The detailed notice of the fine charges that BCCI used Mr Pharaon to get round the Fed's refusal to allow the multina- tional bank to buy a US bank because it was not supervised by any central bank. Mr Pharaon claimed that he was acquiring 100 per cent of Independence Bank's shares. In fact, the document charges, he fully owned only 15 per cent, and held the remaining 85 per cent as a nominee for Interna- tional Credit and Investment Company (Overseas), a Cay- man Islands bank controlled by BCCI. The document said that BCCI also financed part of the 15 per cent stake acquired by Mr Pharaon. These shares, it says, were subsequently transferred to BCCI. \"The violations of law and regulation committed by Phar- aon set forth in this Amended Notice involve personal dishon- esty on the part of Pharaon, including the falsification of official filings with US govern- ment agencies and the willful concealment of the control of Independence by BCCI and ICIC Overseas,\" the document states.

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels THE recent transitional accord limiting Japanese car sales in the EC will fall apart if EC states vie with each other to attract Japanese factories, or if the EC competition directorate interferes with existing dealer- ship practices in Europe, the head of Renault said yesterday. Speaking as president of ACEA, the European car- makers group, Mr Raymond Levy said \"all EC states should act together, and not run after the Japanese and beg them to set up factories\" in the Com- munity. Otherwise, the Community would have to revise what Mr Levy called its \"working hypothesis\" that manufacture of Japanese-brand cars in the EC would rise from 260,000 last year to no more than 1.2m a year by 1999. That is the end of the transition, designed to allow EC car makers to adjust to full Japanese competition from the year 2000 on. Addressing a special Euro- pean Parliament hearing on EC-Japanese relations, Mr Levy also warned the Commis- sion against making \"any bru- tal change\" in its competition rules that would \"break up the selective distribution system and open the doors to all Japa- nese cars\". Within the overall import quota for the EC market as a whole - set out in the July 31 agreement between Brussels and Tokyo - are five sub-quo- tas for hitherto-protected national markets, including the UK. Policing this complex arrangement depends crucially on Japanese car makers being able to continue to select which distributor serves which part of EC territory. In fact, the Commission's July 31 statement declared that it would not use competition law to obstruct the working of the car accord. But EC car makers have a 10-year anti- trust exemption that runs out in 1995. European and UK con- sumer organisations this week jointly complained to Sir Leon Brittan, the competition com- missioner, that the import of Japanese cars into the UK was rigged in a way that was illegal under EC rules. The Japanese car import agreement came under oppos- ing cross-fire at the European Parliament's hearings. The German federation of industry said it was protectionist and would only push the range of Japanese cars in Europe \"up market\", while Mr Clyde Pres- towitz, a former senior US trade negotiator, predicted \"it will ultimately collapse\" because it was so \"open to dif- fering interpretation\".",

   "text_content" : "M AR Bernardo wagner, managing director, S has a new jopb He is constructing a massive \"cook- ing pot\" to feed 400,000 mal- nourished children a day ii Lima. It is Peru's most ambi- tious feeding project. The twin, stainless steel \"reactors\", bakery and 1,200 sq m storehouse, on a donated site in Lima's southern suburb of Chorrillos, mean an invest- ment of around $750,000 (Â£444,000). Most of the bill has been footed by Mr Wagner's parent company, HB Fuller of Minnesota. \"This is a message from a North American company that believes in the free market,\" he says. \"I'm a capitalist, but the kind of capitalism we have here in Peru is barbaric. The market economy can't solve everything.\" When the incoming govern- ment of Mr Alberto Fujimori took sudden and drastic eco- nomic stabilisation measures last August, Lima's ever-hun- gry poor faced overnight food price rises of 400-500 per cent. Mr Wagner was moved by the plight of those living close to Fuller's Lima plant which pro- duces industrial glue. He turned the company's %he Paris Club ao credto IwmininmTa has agreed to rid to iormllwe it relatloio with forelin creditors, our r.ei Staff l rp o bt.

With demand for the HB Fuller product sharply down at the same time, he had the brain- wave of converting one of the huge glue-mixers into a \"giant pot\" to produce a basic but nutritious porridge. Mr Wagner's businessman's eye for costs makes for an approach to feeding which dif- fers radically from that of tra- ditional international aid pro- grammes. \"It's the cost per ounce of protein that interests me,\" he says. By importing soya from Bolivia, he has reduced the cost of a 15-gram helping of porridge to under five cents. The new 30-ton capacity reactors will allow economies of scale to cut that even further. The standard ration contains all the essential nutritional requirements for children under six, at whom Mr Wag- ner's programme is aimed. \"If we can't provide adequate nutrition for our infants, we're bringing up a retarded genera- tion which is ultimately unemi ployable,\" he says. The test programme has been feeding 10,000 children under six daily for the past year. The food lorry's arrival in Huaycan, one of Lima's newest and most impoverished shanty- towns, is the event of the day. \"The food is a godsend,\" says Agapita, who, like many of Huaycan's inhabitants, is a recent refugee from the guer- rilla violence of the Peruvian Andes. Her husband, a peasant farmer who had joined the vil- lage civil defence squad, was killed by Maoist Shining Path terrorists 18 months ago. Juana has no support frum relatives, no employment except as an occasional laun- dress. There is no social secu- rity and she and her five young chnildren literally survive hand-to-mouth. So far, a handful of local companies have chipped in with contributions to the proj. ect and Peru's largest corpora- ton, US-owned Southern Peru Copper, is to finance the $50,000 (Â£29,600) bakery. But persuading fellow businessmen to support his project has been an uphill struggle for Mr Wag- ner. He has also run up against different approaches byinterna- tional relief agencies, such as Caritas, Care and Prisma, through which the bulk of US food aid is channeled. These agencies distribute food to \"community kitchens\" where local women commu- nally purchase, cook and serve meals. \"The idea of a lorry coming in and dishing out food is completely inimical to all the values of self-help and com- munity effort we are trying to promote,\" said one aid worker. Mr Wagner disagrees. \"We're talking about basic survival,\" he says. The first priority is to feed, the second to do it in a 'Businessmen are uniquely equipped to solve problems like this. They have the technology, the organisation and the capital - all they lack is the humanity' socially acceptable way.\" He is receiving some assis- tance from the US Agency for International Development which has approved a $50,000 (Â£29,600) grant to roof the store- house. As USAID officer George Baldino says, \"Let's respect both approaches to feeding. An idea like Mr Wag- ner's could complement com- munity kitchens without destroying what they have achieved.\" Other detractors say this is a job for the government, but Mr Wagner believes the business community should take the ini- tiative. \"The government has so many problems and so few resources,\" he argues. \"Busi- nessmen are uniquely equipped to solve problems like this. They havp the tech- nology, the organisation and the capital - all they lack is the humanity.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington MR ROBERT GATES yesterday blamed the US Treasury and the Comptroller of the Cur- rency for failing to inform law enforcement agencies in the US about suspected fraud at the Bank of Credit and Com- merce International. Mr Gates, who is President George Bush's choice to be the next director of the CIA, min- imised his own knowledge of BCCI's activities and the Agency's involvement during Senate confirmation hearings. However, under questioning, Mr Gates admitted that he had a responsibility to pass on information about possible criminal activities to the US Justice Department. In future, he promised, \"I will see to it that Justice is informed.\" Appearing before the Senate Intelligence committee yester- day, Mr Gates offered the first detailed review of CIA know- ledge about the Abu-Dhabi con- trolled bank, and sought to offer some explanation as to why the Federal bureaucracy took so long to act against the rogue bank. Mr Gates said the US Trea- sury first requested a report on BCCI in 1984. This report was passed to the Treasury and to the Comptroller of the Cur- rency in January 1985. Mr Gates said the CIA had a \"difficult relationship\" with the Federal Reserve. \"I would have relied on Treasury to inform the appropriate authori- ties. That would not be an unreasonable assumption.\" However, it was only in 1989 that the Justice Department secured a guilty plea from BCCI, on money laundering charges which resulted in a $15m fine. Mr Gates has been accused by Mr William von Raab, then US customs commissioner, of being \"less than candid\" about the CIA's relationship with BCCI shortly before the money laundering charges which resulted in the indictments of 84 individuals. During yesterday's session, Mr Gates faced a torrid interro- gation from Democratic Sena- tors who called him a \"hear no evil, see no evil bureaucrat.\" Mr Gates was accused of turning a blind-eye to the Iran- Contra arms-for hostages scan- dal. He also faced tough ques- tions as to whether he had overstated the Soviet military threat to justify the 1980's defence build-up under Presi- dent Reagan. In effect, Mr Gates, 47, has asked sceptical Senators this week for a second chance to secure the job of the nation's spymaster which he has sought all his professional life.",

Mr Mosbacher and Mr Eiichi Nakao, Japan's minister of trade, yesterday met during a series of talks between officials and private sector representatives of both countries on their bilateral commercial relations. Mr Mosbacher's spokesman said Mr Nakao had agreed to the long-sought study. US officials hope the study will dramat- ise the extent of losses incurred by US parts makers. US parts makers have com- plained of an inability to sell in Japan at the same time that they are losing large chunks of their home market when Japa- nese car transplants in the US buy their parts from Japanese producers. Mr Mosbacher has been resisting requests by the American industry to bring a trade complaint against Japan for its barriers to US parts. Mr Michael Far- ren, US under-secretary of international trade, yesterday stressed the Bush admin- istration's desire to work co-operatively with Japan and hoped solutions could be found by the two private sectors. In the last 18 months the Commerce Department and Miti have embarked on several ventures designed to US increase access to the Japanese market. Japan's External Trade Organisation has begun publishing information on trade events, commercial opportunities in Japan and Japanese companies seeking US exporters.

Mr Aristides Junquelro has recommended the suspension on the grounds that President Fernando Collor exceeded his powers by allowing foreign debt to be used as payment in the sell-offs. According to Mr Junqueiro, a presidential decree qualify- ing Multi Year Deposit Facility Agreements (DFAs), matured debt held at the central bank, as eligible currency was ille- gal. The Usiminas sale was origi- nally planned for June 1990. The attorney general has rec- ommended that if the sale pro- ceeds the only eligible cur- rency should be privatisation certificates (CPs), which sinan- cial institutions were forced to buy last year, and blocked crm- zados, frozen in an assets squeeze last year. Mr Eduardo Modiano, head of the programme, says this would either impede the sale or reduce the price to a non-vi- able level.

The paper comes from the Hansard Society's Commission on Electoral Campaigns, chaired by Mr Christopher Chataway, the chairman of Crown Communications and a former Tory MP and minister. The society is a non-party foundation for the study of par- liamentary government. The paper warns: \"The nature of elections has changs. radically over the last century and a structuie designeid for a different era needs regular review f it is not to become obsolete.\" The proposal to remove the prime minister's \"untrammel- led discretion\" to call an elec- tion at the point within the five-year term that most suits the government party - which was opposed by a minority of the commission - is based on the German model. Under that system, an early election can be called only when a govern- ment lacks enough parliamen- tary support to continue in office.

The initiative is one of the largest Link programmes announced since they started in 1988. Their aim is to encourage collaboration between industry and the research community through 50 per cent support for strate- gic research projects. In the case of the five-year engineering materials pro- gramme, the Department of Trade and Industry will con- tribute Â£7m and the Science and Engineering Research Council Â£3m.

   "text_content" : "By James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent THE SCOTTISH National party, which is lying third in the Scottish opinion polls, is this week expected to support a policy of renationalising the electricity, gas and public- transport industries, as well as ending the sale of council houses. The party's annual confer- ence, which starts today in Inverness, will on Friday debate the move to the left on economic policy that is aimed at attracting disenchanted Labour supporters. According to the latest ICM opinion poll, support for the SNP in Scotland stands at 19 per cent, behind Labour with 43 per cent and the Con- servatives with 25 per cent. There is some disappoint- ment in the SNP that it is fail- ing to exploit parallels between the achievement of indepen- dence by the Baltic states and the case for Scottish indepen- dence. Mr Alex Salmond, who was elected party leader last year amid great enthusiasm, has not achieved the public stature for which many in the party had hoped. He has been accused of being autocratic and isolated. Mr Jim Sillars, the well-known MP for Govan, is challenging Mr Alasdair Mor- gan, Mr Salmond's associate, for the post of deputy leader of the party. The election takes place on Saturday. The departure of Mrs Thatcher and the abandon- ment of the poll tax have removed two of the SNP's best targets, and opposition has emerged in the party to its flagship policy of independence within the EC. Critics argue that Scotland should not hand over its sovereignty to the EC immediately on winning it. The party hopes to receive stimulus from the actor Sean Connery, who contributed a voice-over to an SNP party political broadcast this week.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy THE BBC is to go ahead with the launch of a 24-hour televi- sion news service in Asia in a joint venture with leading Hong Kong business interests. The news and information channel, run by the BBC's World Service Television arm, will be broadcast on Hutch- Vision's Star TV, a five- channel television system. HutchVision is a joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa, the commercial conglomerate, and a company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong businessman, and his family. The channel will open on October 14 with a two-hour introductory service. By the middle of November there will be a round-the-clock channel with world news bulletins on the hour. The channel will also feature Asian news, international busi- ness, weather and current affairs. There will be some pro- grammes from BBC English, the language teaching arm of the BBC World Service. Mr Christopher Irwin, chief executive of World Service Television, said yesterday that the deal would transform the BBC arm into a global opera- tor. The satellite transmitting the advertising-financed chan- nel covers 38 countries, and the service will be available through satellite dishes, cable television networks and re- broadcasting from conven- tional television stations. Eventually World Service Television, funded through BBC Enterprises, the commer- cial side of the BBC, hopes to be able to challenge Mr Ted Turner's CNN in the interna- tional television market. Under the 10-year agree- ment, the BBC will share prof- its with HutchVision. Star TV has already launched sports and music channels through co-operative ventures with the US sports network Prime Network Inter- national and MTV, the pop music channel. A Chinese channel and a family channel are also to be launched. The deal will also enable BBC World Service Radio to use sound channels to distrib- ute its radio programmes throughout the region.",

That compares with an aver- age rise of 8.7 per cent for man- agers with pay-review dates in the three months up to and including April, according to an independent survey of top salaries published today. The upper quarter of manag- ers' salary increases showed a decline from 9.5 per cent in the earlier part of the year to 8.5 per cent for May to July. In the bottom quarter, increases were down from 7.5 per cent to 6 per cent during the same period, the survey found. The analysis of pay awards for managers and professional staff from more than 150 organ- isations was carried out by the Top Pay Unit of the research group Incomes Data Services.

Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the EOC, said the find- ings of an EOC survey, to be published next month, and those of a recent survey by the Policy Studies Institute showed again that decisions about training were influenced by stereotyped attitudes of what constituted women's work and men's work. The EOC said the investiga- tion would gather information about good equal-opportunity practices that could be dissemi- nated to the emerging network of Training and Enterprise Councils and other relevant training bodies and agencies. * No changes are to be made to the quota system for the dis- abled, Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said Under existing legislation, the disabled should make up at least 3 per cent of the work- force in companies employing more than 20 people. However, most large companies gain exemption certificates. The last prosecution concerning non- compliance with the legislation was in 1975.",

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers EURO Brokers Capital Markets yesterday strongly denied Ale- gations made 'at a Lndon industrial tribunal that it forced a broker out of her job after she took time off to have a baby. Ms Lilliane Preisler claimed that she was a victim of sexual discrimination and construc- tive dismissal when the City brokers refused to promote her or pay bonuses totalling Â£50,000 on her return to work in January this year. Her earn- ings package had previously been worth a total of about Â£150,000 a year, the tribunal heard. Ms Cindy Buggins, manag- ing director of the company, denied that she had ever refused to promote a pregnant woman. If a woman of the right capabilities were to come up for promotion she would get the job, even if she were about to start a period of maternity leave, Ms Buggins said. She had never had any inten- tion of promoting Ms Preisler because Ms Preisler was too selfish and was not respected by her colleagues, Ms Buggins said. \"She would have had to become much more under- standing and much more of a team player.\" Ms Buggins said she feared Ms Preisler was talking to com- petitors and did not plan to return from maternity leave. Ms Preisler had refused to give a firm date for her return and had indicated that she had wanted to renegotiate her con- tract, Ms Buggins added. When Ms Preisler resigned in January, shortly after returning to work, Ms Buggins said she had been astounded. \"I thought the company had done nothing at all to warrant that kind of action. We had bent over backwards to get her back, we had given her incen- tive payments, we had let her keep the company car.\" Ms Preisler yesterday with- drew an earlier claim that she had not known she was preg- nant with her second child when she left the company. Ms Buggins said she could only feel that Ms Preisler had resigned \"because she wanted to stay at home and have a family\". The hearing was adjourned until October 24.",

   "text_content" : "THE package of far-reach- ing reforms in working practices proposed yes- terday by Rover, the leading UK car maker, bears stark tes- timony to the harsh, competi- tive pressures the European motor industry is facing in the 1990s. The pressures come from Japanese car makers as they establish their first wave of European manufacturing plants. The three leading Japanese car producers, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, have all chosen the UK to locate their first Euro- pean car plants. The move puts UK car makers in the front line of the Japanese assault on Europe. In preparing the reform pro- posals, entitled Rover Tomor- row - The New Deal, and in gaetermining the benchmarks Tor worldwide competitive standards, the company has drawn heavily on its existing close co-operation with Honda. The Japanese company owns 20 per cent of the Rover vehicle operations. Rover, like most other Euro- pean car makers, has also stud- ied with trepidation the perfor- mance of the Nissan plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, the first Japanese car plant to be set up in Europe. Rover said yesterday that it was achieving a level of 22.5 hours a car at its plant in Longbridge, Birmingham, com- pared with the best levels of 16.8 hours a car in Japan. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan's UK plant, said last week that the Sunder- land operation was achieving levels of fewer than 15 hours a car. \"We are the best in Europe in labour productivity. We are as good as the equivalent Japa- nese plant and a bit ahead of the US.\" To compete, Rover is propos- ing a range of reforms includ- ing: * Moving towards a form of no-disruption deal. Rover is suggesting that if any griev- ance involving a trade union Kevin Done on the car maker's work reform proposals cannot be resolved in the dis putes procedure, it should be referred, if both parties agree, to binding arbitration. * All negotiations or consulta. tions would be conducted on \"a joint trades union basis. A sin. gle company council represent. ing all trades unions and employees will be established\". * Rover would become a sin gle-status company. Clocking in would be phased out. Remaining distinctions between salaried and hourly- paid staff would be removed and all employees would be paid by monthly credit trans- ser. There would be a single- status sick pay scheme. No employee would be laid off dur. ing a production downturn, but would be required to \"engage in worthwhile activities and co-operate with efforts to main. tain productive output\". * A single-grade structure would eventually be intro. duced. In an interim step, the present five-grade \"hourly paid structure would be progres sively replaced by a scheme with only two levels of occupa tional classification\". The six grade staff structure would be replaced by a scheme with fewer levels. * Continuous improvement would be a requirement foi everyone, designed to elimi nate waste, increase levels oi efficiency and reduce man. power levels. * Full \"flexibility related tc work procedure and betweer jobs, areas and all categories ol employees will be the norm\". * There would be a maximum devolution of responsibility tc employees and to teams ol workers responsible for vari ous areas, such as quality and work allocation.",

   "text_content" : "By Juliet Sychrava THE ROW over how much companies generating their own electricity on site should pay the pool, or spot market, should soon be resolved. The Pool Executive Commit- tee (PEC), which runs the pool, will meet tomorrow to discuss four possible options. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, will make a final decision before the end of the year, based on its report. His decision will be critical for the future of companies such as Air Products, which supplies British Steel with elec- tricity on the company's own site. The pool rules at present compel such generators to sell all the electricity they produce on site to the pool, then buy back what they need, so incur- ring \"uplift\", the pool service charge. The four new options being discussed include a proposal A POWER station using rubbish from Lewisham, south-east London, is likely to be among renewable- energy projects chosen for support under the govern- ment's Non-Fossil Fuel Obli- gation scheme, to be announced at the end of this month. The 30MW plant, to cost Â£95m, Is being built by a Joint venture led by a UK unit of Compagnie G&nurale de Chauffe, the French energy company, a subsid- lary of Compagnie Generate des Raux, the water group. from on-site generators, under which they would pay uplift only for additional electricity bought from the pool. A second option, backed by the regional electricity compa- nies and National Power, the generator, would continue to charge them uplift on all their production, with a modest dis- count. It would include an exemption of 25 years for gen- erators already trading on March 381 last year. A third option, from Offer, the industry watchdog, and generator PowerGen, suggests an annual tariff for on-site gen- erators to cover the electricity they estimate they would need from the pool that year. A south option, put forward by the PEC itself, sugsts that on-site genetators sould pay uplift on all electricity except that which they use oh their own site, provided it is a single site. That will lead to dispute among PEC members as to what constitutes a single site. If, as expected, it means a site under single ownership, com- panies such as Air Products will still incur pool charges on the electricity they supply to British Steel.",

   "text_content" : "w riaih cuts prices soo power cu&stl ers by ip a thern, wii announced yesterday after:a six-month argument over a previous price increase. The new price opened the way for 18 companies with planned power projects in the UK to start negotiations over gas supply. Even so, Mr Colin Webster, National Power's commercial director, said he believed that, with that price for gas, none of the projects would be competitive. Mr James McKinnon, direc- tor general of the Office of Gas Supply, the industry regulator, has suggested that he might force British Gas to cut prices again if enough power compa- nies complained to him. British Gas has tried to limit what it sees as \"staggering\" demand from the power sector by imposing a ceiling of Ibn therms for the market - a level that accounts for only a fifth of demand. That will limit the amount of gas available to individual compahies to 525m therms each - cutting out big users such as National Power, which has already contracted to buy much of that. Mr Webster said. \"What has happened on this schedule vir- tually excludes us from bid- ding. It's an extremely peculiar restriction and it doesn't seem a very good basis for other companies to do business with British Gas.\" British Gas, however, said it imposed the limit to ensure that no single company could monopolise the restricted gas supply from 1995, when the new prices apply. The utility was forced by Ofgas to cut prices now. It would have pre- ferred to wait for the demand picture to become clearer next year before producing a new price schedule.",

   "text_content" : "InJection of funds: John Maior last niht stressed his commitment to the health service By Philip Stephens, Political Editor MR JOHN MAJOR sought to underline his commitment to the National Health Service with a pledge yesterday that the government would con- tinue to provide extra resources for health care. With the Labour party set to make health one of the central issues of the general election, the prime minister emphasised in a speech to an audience of nurses that care would remain \"free at the point of use in hos- pitals and in doctors' sur- geries\". He added in his speech at the Nursing Standard/BUPA Nurs- ing Nurse 1991 awards dinner in London: \"Extra resources will continue to be provided for the NHS year after year, within the limits the economy can afford.\" At the same time, extra funds freed by increased efficiency in hospitals would be ploughed back into patient care and not handed to the Treasury. In a speech that emphasised his personal as well as political commitment to the NHS, Mr Major strongly defended the government's reforms as the route to further improvements in health care. The Patient's Charter, which the government will soon pub- lish, would reinforce that trend by spelling out in detail what people could expect from the NHS. Health authorities and hospitals would be forced to publish details of all services, to provide information on guaranteed waiting times and to introduce proper complaints procedures. Patients would have a named nurse or mid- wife from start to finish. Mr Major also reaffirmed his view that there was more scope for \"collaborative ven- tures\" with the private sector.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy THE PRESS Complaints Commission is planning to publish a detailed analysis of how far its adjudications have been observed. The analysis will be con- tained in the first annual report of the self-regulatory body for the newspaper indus- try, set up in the wake of the Calcutt Committee on privacy. It is due in January next year. The report may help to determine whether self-regula- tion of the industry is to sur- vive. The Calcutt Committee recommended that the commis- sion, set up this year, should be given 18 months to see if non-statutory self-regulation could be made to work. Lord McGregor of Durris, commis- sion chairman, said yesterday in the report on the body's first six months: \"Accordingly, the press and the commission were both put on probation until the middle of 1992.\" A primary consideration would be the extent to which the press was observing its new code of practice. Politi- cians would be looking at the frequency with which newspa- pers continued to breach the code after complaints against them had been upheld. The continuation of self- regulation would in large mea- sure depend on the extent to which newspapers and periodicals observed the code and commission adjudications. Lord McGregor said that dur- ing the 1980s a small number of newspapers had failed to observe the basic ethics of journalism and had given the whole industry a bad name. In its first six months the Press Complaints Commission has upheld complaints against six national newspapers: the Daily Mail, News of the World, The People, The Sun, the Sun- day Mirror and Today.",

He said: \"Schools, under nor- mal employment law, can secure the removal of a new teacher if he or she is not up to scratch.\" Earlier, the chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents 233 indepen- dent schools, condemned the publication of \"school league tables\". Under proposals in the Citizen's Charter, examination results of all schools will be published in each area, with truancy and staying-on rates. Mr Geoffrey Parker, high master of Manchester Gram- mar School, said private schools were worried that they would be forced to publish results in \"far too crude\" a fashion. There was a danger that this \"national obsession\" would neglect other important areas of schools' performance, he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent BRITAIN'S public-sector finances moved sharply into deficit last month, with the result that government borrow- ings in the first five months of 1991-92 already match the tar- get for the full financial year. The Central Statistical Office said the public-sector borrow- ing requirement (PSBR), or def- icit, in August was Â£l.85bn compared with a surplus of Â£1.04bn in July. The month's shortfall was twice the Â£918m deficit of August last year. Last month's shortfall brought the cumulative bor- rowing requirement for April to August to Â£7.9bn, which was equal to the deficit expected for the whole of 1991-92 in the Budget in March, and well above the Â£3.9bn cumulative deficit recorded by August last year. Even so, Treasury officials said yesterday's figures did not indicate that public-sector finances were lurching uncon- trollably into the red. The Budget switch from the community charge to a higher 17.5 per cent rate of value added tax had resulted in sub- stantial \"front-end loading\" of the PSBR which would take some months to unwind, they explained. Not until August were VAT receipts at the new, higher rate credited to the Treasury. The government also expects a substantial increase in priva- tisation receipts and can be confident of at least reaching its Budget target of Â£5.5bn. Income from privatisation during August was only about p 6 4 Â·2 0 2 4 Â£11 tot to wi me thi ant ni( m( BI for lat me arj fin bn; me no da me for 1 mi sai exl in Pulilc sector financ Mbn 1990 1991 Â£100m, but the cumulative total so far this year amounted to Â£3.6bn by August, compared with Â£1.7bn in the first five months of 1990-91. Instalment payments from the earlier sales of generating and regional electricity compa- nies should bring the govern- ment to its privatisation target. It also plans to sell part of BT, formerly British Telecom, for an as yet unknown amount later this year. The heavy tax-gathering months of October and Janu- ary should also help to plug its finances. The August deficit was broadly what the financial markets expected, and caused no stir. Nevertheless, the City does not expect the govern- ment to meet its PSBR target for 1991-92. Mr John Shepperd, an econo- mist with Warburg Securities, said borrowing was generally expected to total about Â£10bn in this financial year.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman LARGE British companies improved their liquidity in the first half of this year, mainly by raising funds through a rash of capital issues. Yet Central Statistical Office figures issued yesterday showed big companies as a whole continuing to run their short-term finances in deficit. The CSO said the liquidity ratio of large industrial and commercial companies improved to 72 per cent at the end of the second quarter from 65 per cent at the end of the first quarter, and was well above its low of 61 per cent in the third quarter of last year. The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It gives an indica- tion of the ability of businesses to lay their hands on short-term funds. At the end of 1987, the liquid- ity position of the UK's large industrial and commercial companies was in surplus, with a ratio of 116 per cent. By the end of this year's sec- ond quarter, the companies surveyed by the CSO had a def- icit of Â£13.9bn of short-term lia- bilities over assets, against Â£17.6bn three months earlier and a peak deficit of Â£20.6bn at the end of 1990's third quarter. Yesterday's figures contin- ued to show a wide divergence between large manufacturing companies, which operated with a slim cushion of liquid- ity, and the non-manufacturing sector, which returned to hav- ing surplus liquidity in the first half. The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies rose to 43 per cent at the end of the first half of this year from 35 per cent at the end of the first quarter. Non-manufacturers, by contrast, were found to have liquidity ratios averaging 128 per cent by the middle of this year, against 121 per cent at the end of the first quarter.",

The aiiea to remove all the paper from share trading, so that transac- tions can be completed at the touch of a button. The scale %of the task has become all too apparent. Diffi- culties in devising a legal framework in which the owner- ship of companies can be trans- ferred electronically, and con- structing new investor protection arrangements, forced Taurus to miss its planned launch this autumn. Then there were the systems problems. The exchange's attempt to write new software to enhance Talisman, its exist- ing settlement system, has met difficulties, forcing a two- month delay of one important step in the Taurus develop- ment. That and other obstacles have forced Mr Watson to con- clude that Taurus will not meet its revised target launch date next May.

A management consultant from Coopers uade Lybran Deloitte who has been on las, andment. at the exchange for the palt two years, he is the one who knocked heads tomether at the end of Ther19 to obtdin rement on a omrudging, sup- mise design for the system, overcoming entrenched opposi- tion in parts of the industry. Sfor Mr Watson has surmounte considerable obstacles to get this far with Taurus, and is not ffkely to let drawing short delay get in hisfrom way. He was one of those behind the original plan for the syst the original plan for the sys tri, batched l ng 10 ago au IM9 At that time he wadep- uty chief ecutive of the Stock Exchinge and had been project ar oethe cntly pe aiNsmand develop- m~enht. That system enabled mark Moab' ofio to settle a itbeir deals through Sepon, a central noadmine account; sav- ing them the task of settling each individual bargain with each counterparty they dealt with. aurus, the next step, would do away with the paper-based processing arrangements and enable the stock market to move away from the peaks of settlement activity after each of its fort- nightly trading \"account\" peri- ods. Nothing, however, came of the original plans, and by 1983 an event of far greater signifi- cance shattered the Stock Exchange's calm: the deal between Sir Nicholas Goodison and the Office of Fair Trading that was to lead to Big Bang. Attention on new systems switched to the trading desks and Taurus was forgotten. It was not until early 1988 - after the settlement backlog clogged up most brokers' back offices in the City - that Tau- rus returned to the top of the agenda. Ironically, Mr Watson appears at times to suggest that Taurus may not even be necessary. He points, for instance, to the Â£8bM backlog of unsettled share bargains London at the time of the 1987 stock market crasLh As share prices tumbled, securities firms were not left with huge losses because of the settlemenit delays. So why bother with more efficient settlement? Because, Mr Watson replies, the securities industry has passed into the hands of bn. Bankers are aqutely aware of potential liabilities, even if those liabilities never eventu- ally materialise. Before banks took over the UK securities industry, he says, \"it was the old club - you trusted the people you dealt with to deliver. That has all changed. In a larger mar- ket, you need new rules.\" Unfortunately for Mr Wat- son, though, the stock market has changed greatly since the exchange first dreamed up Taurus. Rather than 2m pri- vate shareholders, there are 10m - and consequently a far greater attention by the gov- ernment to the issue of inves- torprotection. The exchange appears now to have felt its way through the political difficulties and to have established a basic tech- nical platform from which Tau- rus at last seems attainable - although considerable work still needs to be done. ohn Watson: out to turn a grandiose idea into reality nd not likely to let a short delay get in his way",

They used to say America was the land of oppor- tunity; arrive with nothing and depart a richer man. These days you'll find Europe has more profit potential. And we at Norwich Union intend to capitalise on just that with our Pan European Unit Trust. For example, we're looking at large environmental service companies that will help the East Europeans make their power stations safe, and we're talking to Italian engineering firms that will help them modernise their steel plants. After all, we've been successfully managing Unit Trusts for over 15 years now, so you'd really expect us to know what's what. At the moment we have 17 different Trusts investing over Â£730 million of our customers' money. So, if you've toyed with the idea of investing in European stock markets, think about our Pan European Unit Trust. That way we can take the worry out of buying and selling shares. What's more, it takes a financial institution with the resources and expertise of Norwich Union to create a well structured portfolio. We say well structured because a large proportion always goes into tried and tested Blue Chip companies in the UK. And the rest is ploughed into continental shares, especially selected to take advantage of the ongoing situation in Europe. If you have Â£500 or more, you can buy yourself into our Pan European Unit Trust. Alternatively, you can invest from as little as Â£so a month and build up your holding. To find out more, and to receive a free copy of our Essential Guide to UnitTrusts and PEPs, phone 0603 680231, Monday to Friday during office hours, or fill out the coupon.

What would:please me even more than the tenners, however, would be wider recognition by the punditry that Britain has been doing the selfsame thing for years. The shaky formula in question, to which government and opposition parties alike subseribe, maintains that Britain's economy is in need of increased output of graduates each costing the taxpayer about Â£26000. It is a belief that conflicts with the evidence of the table alongside, which outlines what became of the 1990 and 1989 outputs of bachelor- degree graduates from the United Kingdom universities, and from the polytechnics and higher education colleges in England and Wales. The first five columns of figures lump all those types of institutions together, with the final four referring solely to the universities. The shares of the outputs taking up various activities are listed under the annual totals. As may be seen, in 1990 the biggest share was the one denoted by the bottom lne of the table, \"At best short-term UK job at December 31\", which includes three sets of people. The first were unempinlyed at that date, some six months after gaining their degree. The text wern in a job enpected to last no more than three months. The rest were not available for employment at all, as distinct from having returned to an organisation which had kept them on its payroll while they were studying.

Either way, however, each of those two groups well out- numbered every one of the others - and that has been the case, In boom as well as slump, since the relevant statistics were first published in 1974. Even so, the annual emergence of the evidence that graduates are in over-supply does not deter officialdom from maintaining the case for futrther increases in output. The latest such exercise to hand, published 18 months ago and signed by six secretaries of state*, cites surveys of the opinions of nearly 1,700 employers in support of the forecast that in 1992 job- market demand for new degree- winners \"might\" be about 22 per cent above the level of 1988. In that year, the total output at bachelor- level (including the Scottish polys and colleges missing from the table) was 119,917. *Highly qualified people supply and demand HMSO. Â£6S9 It was a convenient forecast, because the 22 per cent rise in demand for graduates happened to coincide with the rise m output thereof that higher student intakes were expected to produce. To be fair to the six ministers, it was also a forecast that they admitted recession could well prove wrong. But the force of their argument was still that the underlying needs of the economy require more and more graduates to be supplied. How far that claim is backed by the survey data is open to doubt. For example, employers who had lately recruited new graduates were asked if a degree was essential in the jobs they'd been engaged for. In two thirds of cases, the answer was no. Moreover, in two thirds of the jobs that people with degrees had taken over from people without, the work had stayed the same. Indeed, the document's main if not only support for the claim is seemingly a simple declaration of faith: \"Higher education offers most young people with the necessary abilities the best way of developing the skills which they and their future employers will need.\" That may well have a hollow ring to the numerous graduates who have been thrown out of work in the recession. Now companies are cutting back on their ical and managerial ranks, the prime question job-applicants are apt to be asked is: What can you make or sell? It is an extremely rare degree course, in Britain at least, that equips its products to do either. iTEADHUNTER Theo Stegers of l Recruitment Matters offers two City-type jobs with separate securities houses he may not name.

   "text_content" : "t : in th mnature of things that Hanson, Britain's most impressive i takeover machine, must surprise and delight. Despite being the darling of investors, large and small, throughout the 1980s Hanson has to keep buying companies to keep the markets interested. Until Monday's Â£351.4m agreed bid for Beazer, the Anglo-American building group, investors and analysts were heard wondering aloud: \"Is Hanson slowing down?\". In the absence of another large bid and having improved the profitability of the companies it keeps, Hanson was finding it difficult to convince investors that it could continue to extract further efficiencies from the businesses it runs. Even in the aftermath of the Beazer deal there are still some sceptics. \"It's a step on the way,\" says Nyren Scott-Mal- den, conglomerates analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the City brokers. \"But I don't think it's necessarily the bid.\" The company has been on the look-out for a \"big\" take- over for the past 18 months - witness its approach to the UK government to buy PowerGen last year, its interest in acquir- ing British Sugar, and now its shareholding in ICI, Britain's biggest manufacturer - and it needs one. An analysis of the composi- tion of Hanson's operating profits suggests that under- lying growth (profits excluding the effects of provisions, net interest and other items) may have stalled. Excluding Beazer, profits between 1988/89 and 1990/91 are expected to grow from Â£925m to only Â£990m - a rise of 7 per cent. Some business academics have forecast that conglomer- ates like Hanson will face \"con- glomerate discount\" - their whole will be worth less than the sum of their parts. While this is glaringly true of its Antipodean imitators - espe- cially John Spalvins' Adelaide Steamship Company, or Alan Bond's Bond Corporation - Hanson has been able to avoid this condition by making fre- quent takeovers. They enable it to keep growing, to maintain investor interest, and to keep its stock market rating high. Beazer amounts to some much- needed oxygen. Hanson was a small-time corporate raider for the first 15 years of its life. The 1980s was the decade when it moved into the big time. Although the company's most recent deals - such as the 1989 Â£3.3bn bid for Consolidated Goldfields, or last year's $1.2bn acquisition of Peabody, the biggest coal pro ACQUmISITIS AND DISPOSALS BY HANSON BIiOHrste Unild (17) Meams(ugh (1M) I M ing (1373) Price: 30m Price: $185 Price: Â£12.2m Disposals: Sm Disposals: Sm Disposals: Â£m 1978 6.3 1981 52.5 1973 11.0 1965 93.5 U08 (193) Price: Â£260m C b9oo (137m) 99.8 Disposals: em Price: $36m 1983 15.2 Disposals: Sm UIdustries (173) 1964 15.3 1977 16.0 Price: L27.9m 1909 231.7 193 6.8 Disposals: 7m 1990 0.9 19899 48.0 HyrMde (197) 1990 1.25 263.15 Price: $32m 49.25 USi (I1M3) Disposals: Sm Price: $532m 1979 11.5 Bere (1981) Disposals: $m 14.0 Price: Â£95m 1984 22.5 140.0 Disposals: Em 1965 36.4 1983 S0.0m 1986 78.7 165.5 19689 Â£1.3m 1987 24.5 Disposals: Sm 1988- 1.9 1989 23.0 ,1990 13.3 200.3 London Brlok (1184) Price: Â£245m Disposals: em 19886 33.0 Imperial Group (198) Price: Â£2.5bn Disposals: Em 19886 1,673.0 1987 23.0 1966 554.7 1969 87.7 1990 1.6 2,340.0 8CM (1m6) Price: Disposals: 1988: 19867: 1988: 1989: 19900 1.585.1 Kaiser (1987) Price: $250m Disposals: Sm 1987 53.2 1988 221.3 274.5 Kldde (1987) Price: $1.5bn Disposals: Sm 1988 411.9 Disposals: 1988 1990 Sm 71.6 250.7 $930m Sm 935.0 33.6 116.0 309.0 41.5 I 734.2 duart Anderson Restaurant (18i) Price: $20m Disposals Sm 1990 11.4 Consolidaled Goldlelds (19M) Price: Â£3.3bn Disposals: Em 1989 614.3 1990 2,039.75 2,654.05 Source: Hanson's US annual reports (Form 20-F) 18S8-189 ducer in the US - live in the mind, it was two transactions, both completed in 1986, thal transformed the company. These were Hanson's Â£2.5bn bid for the Imperial Group and its $930m acquisition of Smitb Corona. In purely financial terms, they were remarkably profitable and rank as two ol the most successful takeovers executed during the 1980s, on either side of the Atlantic. By the end of 1990, Hanson had extracted $1.6bn from sales of SCM assets and Â£2.3bn from sales of Imperial assets. In October last year, Hoare Govett, one of Hanson's UK brokers, valued SCM Chemical in the UK and US at $2.3bn, and Imperial at over Â£lbn. Impressive as these figures are, they are not the sole, or even most important, standard by which Hanson wishes to be judged. Both Lord Hanson and Lord White are stung by sug gestions that they are simply superior financial engineers; they want to be judged on their ability to add value to the assets they manage. \"Management. . .our great. est asset\" is a statement that has graced both its 1989 and 1990 UK annual reports. \"We are an industrial management company,\" Lord Hanson wrote in The Treasurer in June 1987. Key to Hanson's strategy to date has been its decision to avoid businesses which are heavily capital-intensive - such as steel, shipbuilding, nuclear power, oil and gas. This explains why most com- ment concerning Hanson's ~r,,,, - a -- M Lu Â· -r YMr -- 5Ir0.. us. Â·rUÂ· m I \"rP^rN mmYIÂ· Ã½% mm- = IIU mwl putative bid for ICI often comes down to the likelihood of Hanson selling ICI Pharma- ceuticals. These sorts of busi- ness, Lord Hanson said in 1987, \"rely on huge and expensive research with a prospect of a return sometime or never\". \"We are very different from the general run of major world companies in two significant respects,\" he wrote in The Treasurer. \"The first is that we have elected.. .to concentrate on only two markets, over here and over there. . .The second critical difference is that we are oriented to profit centres not to product.\" Although a transnational in appearance, Hanson is not. Being profit, rather than prod- uct, oriented has meant that the company feels little need for horizontal diversification, especially across frontiers. Hanson is in textiles and foot wear in the US but not in thi UK where it has tobacco and battery assets; bricks and aggregates in the UK but onl3 cement in the US, although the acquisition of Beazer bringi with it America's second larg est aggregates company. This management style alsc means that management struc tures are contained withir frontiers. Both the US and UE halves of Hanson report tc senior managers resident ir either New York or London. In only one product line, tita nium dioxide (SCM Chemical) does Hanson own significani assets that cross frontiers - it this case, in the US, UK and Australia - and a manage ment structure to match. SCN is managed from Baltimore b) Don Borst, chief executive, who was managing the comr pany when Hanson acquired it in 1985/86. Managers who oper- ate SCM's plants in Britain and Australia report to Baltimore. According to Martin Taylor, deputy chairman of Hanson, since January 1986 the con- glomerate has invested $350m in SCM to increase titanium oxide capacity. (SCM also uses a newer, more environmental- ly-friendly, method of produc- ing the chemical.) The head count at SCM has also risen. When Hanson acquired the company it employed 2,200 peo- ple; today it employs 2,500, Taylor says. \"It's a good busi- ness and we've been able to improve it,\" he adds. For the past year, however, rumours have been circulating in the City that Hanson has been wanting to sell the com- pany. Bayer has been men- tioned as a possible buyer, but at a price significantly below the company's $2bn purported asking price. Taylor is ada- mant that those rumours are incorrect: \"We have not had it up for sale,\" he says. But SCM is atypical. The \"over here and over there\" bias in the dominant characteristic of Hanson's strategy and man- agement style, a style, more- over, which was underlined four years ago in an interview Lord (then Sir) Gordon White gave to the FT: \"James and I agreed when we started over here [in the US] that we didn't want to be involved in any country where they didn't speak English. I sold off Ever Ready's European operations because we didn't want to be in Germany and Italy.\" The typical attributes of the companies Hanson keeps, such as Imperial Tobacco, are three- 'aHuAa IL AVVF0 fold. The companies usually operate in a mature low tech. nology sector where they have a dominant or near dominant market share; they have strong cash flow; and, they have capa- ble middle management. The latter are usually the beneficiaries of a process known as \"Hansonisation\". This is a rigorous cost-cutting exercise which results in job losses - for senior managers but job opportunities for less senior ones - and a claw back of investment in plant and research and development. (This is not to say that Hanson never invests; last year capital spending was Â£247m, or 1.8 per cent of revenues of Â£13.4bn.) Since its acquisition of Imperial in 1986, Hanson has reduced the numbers employed by 46 per cent while keeping output constant. Total operat- ing costs have been reduced by 25 per cent. Despite the effi- ciency gains and increased profitability, Hanson has not been able to reverse the secu- lar decline in Imperial Tobacco's market share. In 1985, Imperial had a UK market share of 42 per cent against Gallaher's 34 per cent share; by 1989 those positions had been reversed, with Imperial declin- ing to 35 per cent and Gallah- er's rising to 41 per cent. Last year, Hanson spent Â£40m on the business, part of which went into a state-of-the- art cigarette manufacturing plant in Nottingham. This machinery should make Impe- rial the lowest cost producer of tobacco products in Europe. \"They have halted the decline in Imperial's market share and now appear to be rebuilding it,\" says Nyren Scott-Maldan. Another UK acquisition, that of Berec (renamed British Ever Ready) in 1981, is a copybook example of \"Hansonisation\". Berec s old head offce was cut from 550 to 75 staff and in so doing management layers were reduced from 9 to 3; the blue- collar workforce was cut from 3,658 to 1,061. Hanson's attitude to invest- ment and research is legendary - until recently capital expen- ditures of Â£500 and $1,000 had to be signed off by the chair- man himself, although these limits have since been doubled - and Berec was no different. Its R&D operations at Abing- don, Oxfordshire, were sold and the Tottenham facility was closed. Hanson also sold Berec's foreign operations - for Â£41m - but, in selling Berec's West German subsid- iary it also sold the company which developed the technol- ogy which went into Ever Ready's Gold Seal battery, the company's competitor to Dura- cell's alkaline battery. Hanson has reduced costs, and boosted margins since it owned Ever Ready. Last year analysts estimated that Ever Ready produced operating prof- its of Â£45m. But it has gradu- ally lost share to DuracelL Even Hanson's most ardent admirer and vigorous defender would not claim that the com- pany has achieved its present size and level of earnings per- formance through \"organic\" growth. (In the US, neither has ICI; a lot of its growth there has been the result of acquisi- tion, ironically from Hanson.) Hanson has produced such startling returns because of the takeovers it has made, which have generated a steady stream of profits from disposal and profits from the early years of \"Hansonisation\". But while the process of \"Hansonisation\" may raise an acquired company's efficiency and profitability to a higher level in the short- to medium- term, the long-term growth that these companies - low technology, mature market, large market share - achieve tends to track general eco- nomic conditions. With the current depressed state of the UK and, to a lesser extent, the US, it is little won- der that growth in Hanson's profits has moderated and its share price has under-per- formed the market. But with- out a major acquisition - and it is not clear that Beazer quite fits that bill - Hanson may well struggle to maintain is super-achiever status.",

   "text_content" : "ThÂ· Tknwzon* device r Â·nCK nd Â· hokgnnr iches, Ã½Beyond the -dreams: of avarice 1 ' beckn the developer of the first globally acceptable road pricing system Just as the problems of trf- sic congestion are immense and worldwide, so is the mar- ket for a costeffective method of rationing the available road space among those who are prepared to pay for it. It is withpthis mult-billion dollar carrot in mind that GEC- Marconi, the aerospace and electronics arm of Britain's General Electric Company, has developed Timezone, a system of charging people for driving in urban areas. Until now, governments throughout the world have pre- ferred to live with worsening traffic congestion rather than risk the political repercussions of introducing such a scheme. But the effects of traffic con- gestion on the urban environ- ment have become so damag ing that the need for some sort of solution is growing urgent. Investment in public trans- port is rarely an answer on its own. Often it does little more than improve the lot of exist- ing public transport users: and when it does take motorists off, the roads, their place is simply taken by others. A combination of public transport and road pricing, however, offers the beginnings of virtuous circle. If motorists are charged for their use of the roads, the revenues can be applied to improving public transport, thus giving the motorist a two-fold incentive to switch to a more environmen- tally-friendly mode of travel. So much for theory. In prac- tice, however, road pricing has had a troubled history. The only fully-fledged sys- tem running today is in Singa- pore, where motorists have to buy a daily or weekly permit to drive into the city centre dur- ing the morning peak. Permits are checked visually by police at the city's 29 entry points. Outside the somewhat authoritarian environment of Singapore, most attempts to introduce anything other than motorway, bridge and tunnel tolls have foundered on politi cal objections. The best known example is Hong Kong, where an experi- mental system was abandoned in 1985 on civil rights grounds because the bills itemised the journeys motorists had made. GEC-Marconi's Norman Green says the developers of Timezone were acutely aware of the political sensitivities when they designed the sys- tem. \"We knew that if we didn't get public acceptability, we wouldn't get political acceptability, so we designed our system to satisfy political and socio-economic criteria before we developed the tech- nology,\" he says. The system had to be per- ceived as fair, easy to use, diffi- cult to outwit, and acceptable in terms of civil liberties. GEC-Marconi believes Time- zone addresses all these crite- ria. This is how it works. The motorist has an elec- tronic device about the size of a cigarette packet which is stuck to the windscreen, behind the rearview mirror. A slot in the device accepts a smartcard which charges up the device with credits. The device is brought into operation by radio waves emit- ted by small roadside transmit- ters. The transmitters are installed not just at the entry to a town or city, but through- out the area. Normally, the device is idle. But when it approaches a zone where vharges apply, it is switched on by radio waves from the nearest transmitter and starts consuming credits. The number of credits con- sumed depends on the time spent in the charging zone. But charging stops when the vehicle is parked: the device contains a movement sensor which stops the clock when the vehicle has been motionless for more than a minute or two. A city like London would probably have several zones charging different rates, according to the severity of their congestion. Charges could vary at different times of day. Drivers will be able to re- charge their smartcards at booths across the city, pehaps at service station;. They should not run out of credits because a digital display on the back of the Timesone device will tell them how many they N they do run out, the road- side transmitters will sense this and automatically report the car's registration number to the authorities. But GEC- Marconi emphasises that regis- tration numbers cannot be detected by the system as long as meters remain charged. People without Timezone. devices will not be physically prevented from entering a charging zone. But some trans- mitters will be linked to cam- eras, and if one of these detects a vehicle without a device, it will photograph the vehicle's registration number, read it by computer, and pass the infor- mation on to the authorities. Motorists without devices will be expected to buy a daily, weekly or monthly pass. The issuer of the pass - for exam- ple, a post office - will pass the applicant's registration number to, the authorities so that they know the car has paid for acqess to the zone. In fact, says GEC-Marconi, it will be in motorists' interests to fit a device because it will be given out without any charge to the consumer when the first smartcard is bought. The Timezone will not be transferable. It will be fixed to the windscreen with a bonding agent containing a hologram which will reveal if the bond has been broken. Similarly, each smartcard will only work with the meter for which it is made - though several members of a family may have smartcards which will fit the same meter. This will enable differential charging to be introduced. Meters fitted to lorries, for example, could consume more credits than meters fitted to cars, and some drivers - disa- bled people, perhaps, or resi- dents living within the charg- ing zone - could be allowed to buy credits for their smartcard at a discount.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Water Quality Provokes a Flood of Controversy",
   "text_content" : "John Hunt on the debate over contamination levels ing water is the subject T tyof UK drink- of almost obsessive pub- lic attention. This was high- lighted recently by thepolitical row and media exposure when Three Valleys Water Company supplied customers with unchlorinated water following a fault in the system. \"The entire system of drink- ing water regulation is inade- quate,\" Ann Taylor, Labour's spokeswoman on environmen- tal pollution, declared in the Commons. A week later thousands of Thames Water customers in Oxford had to boil their water after the discovery of E. Coli in the supply. This is a bacterium which may be an indicator of contamination by more serious micro-organisms. Earlier this year South West Water was fined Â£10,000 and ordered to pay Â£25,000 in costs for supplying water contami- nated with aluminium sul- phate to 20,000 customers at Camelford, Cornwall. Customers throughout the country are understandably alarmed when they hear of such a case. But serious inci- dents like Camelford are rare. Most involve microscopic quantities of bacteriological or toxic substances and are dealt with so swiftly that there is no danger to human health. Nevertheless, the overall quality of Britain's drinking water is the subject of highly- charged political controversy. The first report of the new Water Inspectorate, which polices the system, was pub- lished in July. Michael Heseltine, environment secre- tary, saw it as confirmation of the high quality of UK drink- ing water. Of 3.3m tests carried out last year 99 per cent were within the legal limits. Mike Healey, chief inspector, said supplies from the 39 water companies were generally of a high standard and some were exceptionally good. However a closer reading of the report shows that theusitua- tion is not quite so rosy. In four cases the inspectorate is considering whether to prose- cute water companies (so far unnamed) for supplying water unfit for human consumption. Thirty one pesticides were found to exceed levels laid down in the 1989 Water Act although they did not endan- ger health. Indicator organisms in some areas had been detected in greater numbers than expected. Environmentalists scoff at Heseltine's claims. Friends of the Earth say that 10m con- sumers are supplied with tap water contaminated beyond the legal limits in European Community regulations. The EC standard for pesti- cides is one part per 10bn - a level so low that it is known as a surrogate zero. Thames Water complies with the World Health Organisation's stan- dards on safe drinking water and those of the US Environ- mental Protection Agency. In the meantime the govern- ment has accepted undertak- ings that the water will be brought fully into line with EC standards on pesticides by the year 2000 at the latest. Most of the pesticides, which are used in great quantities by gardeners in this densely popu- lated area, will be eliminated from the water by 1993. British Rail and some local authorities have agreed to a Thames request to cease using some persistent pesticides. The water industry has a remedial programme of Â£2bn up to 1995 to improve drinking water quality. Thames is spending Â£500m over the next 10 years to improve water treatment facilities. It has just opened a Â£4m plant at Kemp- ton, near Heathrow, to develop advanced purification systems. Its 25 laboratories are being consolidated into two large ones which are among the most advanced in the world. One is at Reading and one to be opened in London's dock- land in the autumn. At the Reading laboratory 600 samples are tested daily and the lab is .staffed seven days a week. Samples are logged on a computer, and automated machines can test 40 an hour. In contrast a team of four people test the water for taste and odour in the same tradi- tional way as wine tasters. In addition to pesticides there are tests for metals such as lead, aluminium and mer- cury. An electron microscope can investigate right down to the molecular structure. The system relies on the team of water quality inspec- tors operating throughout the Thames area which supplies 7m people from Dartford, Kent, in the east to beyond Swindon in the west. At Reading, Ramon Franco, aged 24, travels up to 150 miles a day visiting treatment sites, boreholes or inlet houses where river water has been taken in. Like many of his col- leagues he has a degree in bio- logical science. He also knocks on doors tak- ing random tests in the home where householders are gener- ally eager to discuss their water. He finds that it is rare to find anyone admitting that their water is perfect. \"If we got to that stage we would be out of a job,\" he observes.",

UARS is a $740m (Â£425m) project designed, as Nasa puts it, \"to help scientists learn more about the fragile mixture of gases protecting the Earth from the harsh environment of space\". The 10 instruments on board the 6.5 tonne satellite are now undergoing preliminary test- ing. They are due to start transmitting information on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere within two weeks. That should be in time to observe the seasonal \"ozone hole\" forming above Antarc- tica, as the sunlight of the southern spring triggers a com- plex series of photochemical reactions involving man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). During the next year, UARS will observe similar processes happening over the northern hemisphere, where springtime ozone depletion is believed to occur not only above the Arc- tic but at latitudes as far south as the US and western Europe. The debate about the way CFCs are destroying the ozone layer has been handicapped by the inadequate data available so far. Ground-based observa- tions from aircraft, balloons, rockets and previous satellites have left room for a lot of sci- entific speculation; UARS is intended to provide a wealth of hard facts during its three-year working life about the chemis- try, dynamics and energy bal- ance of the atmosphere. One instrument, the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder, was designed and built by a UK team involving Oxford Univer- sity, Rutherford Appleton Lab- oratory and British Aerospace. It uses infra-red radiometry to measure chemicals, including ozone, methane, nitrous oxide and water in the upper atmo- sphere. UARS is the first stage of Nasa's Mission to Planet Earth, a 15-year global research pro- gramme using \"ground-based, airborne and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system\". Mission to Planet Earth will get into its stride in the late 1990s, when Nasa plans to launch a series of big environ- mental satellites under the title of Earth Observing Sys- tem. Each will be a space plat- form packed with scientific instruments. The European Space Agency has also made environmental sensing a centrepiece of its (more modest) programme for the 1990s. Its ERS-1 satellite was launched on an Ariane rocket in July and is beginning to transmit high-resolution pic- tures of the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Clive Cookson",

   "text_content" : "COVMW'T ARDI The Royal Opera's latest Rini staging is now complete: tw: cycles (plus a bonus perfor mance of Rheingold) are flUlln out the company schedule ovei the next month. Full-scali Rings are now rather scare: commodities in London - thi last was the 1987 Welsl National Opera presentation al Covent Garden - and, for thai reason alone, rejoicing at thi return of opera's mightiest epii ought to be the communa response. But in the face of the dis mally dank time-tunnel settin: devised by G6tz Friedrich (pro ducer) and Peter Sykorn (designer), rage and despaii seem to me the more reason able modes of audience reac tion - on Monday they wenr mine, anyhow. This is, oli course, a borrowed, not a homegrown, production: a touring Inszenierung from the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, hastily bought in to fill the gap caused by the killing-off of the planned collaboration betweer Yury Lyubimov and Bernard Haitink after the 1988 Rhein gold production. As the seasons have passed, and the Berlin cycle has beer re-built in single episodes, the rashness of this decision ha: grown ever more obvious. Al the start of a complete show ing, and after witnessing foi the first time the Vorspiel, 1 now think it pure folly. Taste is a personal matter, and dis. like of the grey tunnel - underground garage and road way in one - in which the whole cycle is imprisoned may not be universally shared. Sc the case against this produc tion can be more generally made: its canvas is disas- trously pinched and pinioned by the confining, enclosing limitations of the single set; and its early-1980s dramatic gestures have the texture and smell of yesterday's mashed potatoes. The dQfd on feeling is the more strongly pronounced in Was Rheingod, in that several of iedrich's bits of \"political\" business (Donner and Froh as effete sillies, Loge as part-trick: ster, part-professorial truth- teller in a threeilece suit, the giants stamping like clog-danc ers, the entry into Valballa a tranced slow cotillion) were made familiar from the pro- ducer's previous Ring in the same house. The difference is that the earlier Friedrich conception argued its (sometimes agitprop comic-strip) ideas with breath- taking panache and technical virtuosity; to see the same ideas not only gone stale but developed in such theatrically cramped, inhospitable condi- tions makes for a wretchedly poor exchange. The wheezes and squeaks of the set in the opera's early stages need urgent attention - and per- haps the ministrations of an oil-can? Most of the slickers of energy in Monday's performance were registered down in Nibelheim. The subterranean setting is appropriate, at least; the jokes with neon lighting and televi- sion-screen technology were neatly relayed; and, best of all, there were bitingly delivered accounts of Mime from Alexan- der Oliver (much more conii- Alastair Muir The giants, sung by Franz-Josef Selig and Gwynne Howell, with the Freia of Deborah Riedel dent in the role since his 1990 Siegfried debut) and Alberich from Ekkehard Wlaschiha. The latter, sung with ringing clar- ity, distinctive tonal signature and a genuine emotional vital- ity, threatens to be the hero of the 1991 cycle: on a stage other- wise people by (mostly admira- ble) singers diminished by the setting, Mr Wlaschiha at least preserves the scale of the char- acter. He has this in common with Helga Dernesch's stately, elo- quent Fricka and the giants of Gwynne Howell (a beautifully lyrical, romantic Fasolt) ani Franz-Josef Selig. By contrast James Morris is a Wotan oi magnificent voice and musi cally responsive style who with experience grows no grander no more verbally penetrative Kenneth Riegel, an intelligeni artist, fusses horribly with Loge's music (and to my earm the actual tone is continuously disagreeable). Anne Gjevang's Erda, smoothly sung, trips onto the stage like an ageinq hippie; the roles of Freia, Don ner and Froh go for almosi nothing, in spite of competeni singing by Deborah Riedel, Donald Maxwell and Kim Begley. The phosphorescent combi- nation of spectacle, debate, comedy and once-upon-a-time story-telling that can make Dos Rheingold one of the most enjoyable of operas was sorely lacking from Monday's show. Bernard Haitink, though his conducting continues to be the single greatest strength of the whole enterprise, seemed unable to supply it from the pit alone. There was a huge amount to admire in the musi- cal performance - excellent playing (particularly clean, muscular brass and wind), an always striking appreciation of detail, cogent grasp of architec- ture, chivalrous concern for voices - yet it was not until the arrival in Nibelheim that I modulated from a detached appreciation of executive vir- tues to something like involve- ment. No doubt the later Ring episodes will bring back in full the Wagner conductor we have already learned to revere. Max Loppert",

   "text_content" : "I t is ironic that the title of Minder refers not to George Cole's character, Arthur Daley, but to young Terry McCann, the obtuse boxer played by Dennis Waterman. In 1979 Thames TV wanted a role for Waterman when The Sweeney came to an end and he no longer had regu- lar employment as John Thaw's sidekick in the Flying Squad. Instead he became George Cole's sidekick in the same London sub-culture, one which would have been famil- iar to Mayhew: petty thieves, drinking clubs, tarts with hearts of gold and so on. But the series became Cole's per- sonal property, and Daley - the cowardly spiv, with a bossy wife who was never seen ('Er Indoors) and a lovely line in malapropisms (\"'Ow would you have fared in the blitz with bombs rainin' dahn from the Lufthansa?\" he asked last week) - slowly became one of the best known characters on British television. His fame was extended by a long sequence of commercials for a building society in which Cole continued to play the Daley character. When Waterman left, convinced that typecasting as the dimwit was stunting his career, the assumption was that, having cried wolf at the end of each series, Thames really would stop this time.. But with close on 60 overseas buyers for the programmes they overcame even Water- man's departure, cast the unknown Gary Webster as the new sidekick, nephew Ray Daley, and carried on. And, embarrassing as it may be for Waterman, McCann's absence turns out to be irrelevant. Daley is the heart of the series, and the other attractions also remain: the seedy London loca- tions, the comedy, and the cockney argot. The only worry is the scripts. Where the earlier stories were often dense and interesting, the scripts now seem to rely almost entirely on exploiting known character traits. Last week's \"story\" con- sisted of little more than Arthur being winched up the lift shaft of the warehouse that he and Ray had burgled in order to replace 150 cases of corked wine. Thin stuff, though the programme was still undeniably entertaining. Meanwhile, the BBC1 \"com- edy\" series in which Waterman now stars, On The Up, is a dis- appointment which cannot be disguised even by the canned applause which is poured so thickly over it. We all know that exchanges such as \"I don't want to sound prurient but I wish I was a fly on that bed- room wall\" - \"You'd hiccup and fall off\" do not incite gales of hysterical laughter, and creating them artificially fools only the very credulous. Joan Sims has fun as Mrs Wembley, but Waterman is wholly unconvincing as the self-made cockney millionaire. * Did you hear about the riot in Oxford? It became so violent that a number of the students were killed and the university vas closed. Of course that was 637 years ago, in 1354, when rioting was the real McCoy. On that occasion the rioters used swords and daggers and even longbows. One day we shall turn on our televisions oh a sweltering summer evening to watch a riot discussion involv- ing politicians, clergymen and sociologists and not one will say \"What can you expect after a decade of 'gimme-gimme' Thatcherism?\". Not one will say \"Parents no longer know how to be parents\". There will George Cole with his new minder, Gary WebMs .. be no talk about unemploy ment, racism, or comprehen sive schooling. Instead somebody will poini to the similarities between riot ing and morris dancing: both with centuries of traditior behind them, both popular all over England, both offering young men with no war tc fight an outlet for male aggres sion, almost always on long. hot, boring summer evenings Somebody else will suggesi \"Either we take a leaf out ol the book of Not The Nine O'Clock News and cut theii goolies off, or we learn to con tain these riots'a best we can\" to which the next speaker will say \"That's right because a tiny minority of youths would still riot even if everyone was given a Golf GTi on his 17th birthday\". The chairman will wind up by declaring \"Surely we should all stop pretending there's anything in the least unusual or mystifying about it\". Whereupon viewers all over the country will roll off their old green sofas in a dead faint. Something close to that hap- pened on Saturday evening when not one network, not two, but three - simulta- neously! - contrived to offer longish programmes of consid- erable interest to the non-mo- ronic. So accustomed are we to the wasteland of the Saturday schedules that this caused quite a shock. First Channel 4 began its Night In Japan as a curtain raiser to the nation- wide Japan Festival. Being among those who prefer their Japanese culture mysterious, and have no desire to see it more thoroughly integrated with English culture, and hav- ing, in any case, had Japanese television ruined for me by Clive James, I gave this pretty short shrift and moved to BBC2. They were just beginning The Pop Show which took the opening of the Royal Academy exhibition as the occasion for a two-hour up-summer on pop art. It seemed a slight pity and yet no great surprise that the most informative and enter- taining element was a repeat of Ken Russell's 29-year-old Moni- tor programme on Peter Blake, Derek Boshier and others. The visit to the RA itself proved that television has still not dis- opvered; asatifactory jay to deal w th it exhlitions., George Melly, Sarah fnt and Brian Sewell are all good crit- ics, and Melly is invariably amusing, but sending the three round an exhibition together is not much help to a television ',*yewec agedness (or even e rdugh death) of e's\" hful heroes was shocking, but the modern interviews with people such as Richard Hamilton were fasci- nating. For 25 years who has bothered to talk about pop art? BBC1 in the mean time actu- ally seemed to have become some sort of pop art icon: the overhead fish-eye shot of all those Union Jacks (all right, Flags) waving for The Last Night Of The Proms could eas- ily have been something painted by Blake in 1961. And when Gwyneth Jones came out for \"Rule Britannia\" in full regalia - huge brass helmet, trident and shield - the effect was multiplied, though you might have hoped' she would know the words and not need to crib them off the inside of her shield. It is no good, any longer, objecting to the awful jingoism of this concert: like Guy Fawkes night it is an occa- sion sumi generis, the rationale for which was long ago forgot- ten. Thanks to director Kriss Rusmanis it made rather good television this year. * BBCl's preceding programme was The House Of Elliott, latest in a vast catalogue of costume dramas. Is it not extraordinary to go to such lengths to ensure the utter authenticity of trains, hats, furniture, newspapers and goodness what else in this production and yet to cast in one of the two principal roles (Evie) an actress (Louise Lom- bard) with such an unmistake- ably e century accent? B and iairectors t er hat a howler it is toipe this obvious anachronism after taking such obsessive trouble with all the other details? It is probably a forlorn hope but it would be nice, would it not, if we could get through the rest of the run up to the general election without being told twice a night on television that the British electorate may vote for a hung parliament. In the first of a new series of Question Time Paddy Ashdown repeatedly trotted out this idea which is, surely, complete non- sense. Each electot goes out and votes for an individual, presumably in the hope that he and, it is hoped, his party, will win. \"Tactical voting\" may have some meaning within a single constituency, but the idea that the British electorate is capable of co-operating nationally to produce collec- tively the results necessary for a hung parliament is sheer fan- tasy. That may well be the out- come, but none of us is capable of voting for it. Christopher Dunkley",

Live long enough and you see just about everything reversed. When I was a child potatoes were awful fat- tening things and sugar was the great energy giver, full of glucose. Now it's \"Potatoes - hurray! Sugar - boo!\" Similarly with the Spanish Civil War Italy and Germany used to be the villains of the piece but according to the first in a new batch of Timewatch (8.00 BBC2) the destruction of Spain's nascent democracy is all down to perfidious Albion. Stick around long enough and this will be changed again, no doubt. Today's \"Screenplay\", Journey To noack (9.00), will inevitably attract high-minded objections from some viewers who will protest that motor neurone disease is not a fit subject for comedy. They should be told that writer William Ivory (best known as Eddie Ramsden from \"Coronation Street\") dedicated this, his first television drama, to his mother who died of the disease. John Hurt plays one of the men who set off for Knock hoping for a miracle cure. BBC1 begins another run of Inside Story with an account of the children of American soldiers and Vietnamese women hunting for their fathers in the USA (9.30). Christo per Danley",

   "text_content" : ",AllEDIA TM ATMI Gilbert Murray wrote in the introduction to his own trans- lation of Hippolytos in 1902 that the play itself needs little comment or explanation. While that may have been true 90 years ago, it is doubtful how far it holds good today. Most people will be more familiar with Racine's Phidre. Not everyone will know that Sen- eca had a shot at it and called it Phaedra, and probably even fewer that Euripides himself had at least two goes at it while Sophocles produced a version of his own in between. The problem seems to have lain with the sex, and how explicit to be. There is also the question, as the changing title suggests, of who is the central character Hippolytos or Phal- dra? Still, one is inclined to agree with Murray that the best thing to do is to play it straight. That means keeping the sex off-stage and sticking to the text, Gods and all. The production at the Almeida is an English version by David Lan. It eschews Mur- ray's rhymed couplets for the vernacular. Where Murray has Aphrodite saying of Hippolytos that he \"seeks no woman's kiss\", Lan substitutes \"sex to his mind stinks\". There is nothing necessarily wrong with that. Where the production runs into difficulties is in trying to impose a kind of late 20th cen- tury feminism that in the end does not fit. If reminders are needed, Hippolytos not only prefers sport to sex: he avoids sex altogether. He is desired by his step-mother, who commits suicide accusing him of having raped her. Hippolytos, well enough played by Duncan Bell, is not much of a part, just a straight male lead. Phaidra is better and worthy of Janet Suzman, but the trouble is that she kills herself half-way through. That leaves Theseus, the husband and father. The contradiction here is that Theseus enters as a stock male chauvinist, yet it is he who loses his wife and son and eventually emerges as the hero if only because there is virtu- ally no-one else left. Ian McDiarmid manages this tran- sition with great dignity, but on this reading the play really ought to be renamed Theseus. For it is not only the exces- sively overt feminism that it counter-productive; it is the down-grading of the Gods. The Gods exist in the text; Andrei Serban's production does its perverse best to pretend that they are a tiresome sideshow. None of that is meant to dis- suade anyone from going to see it; this Hippolytos, however, is more for the addict than the random theatre-goer. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "In the centre of the vast, bare stage of the Commonwealth Institute's Great Hall: an Indian carpet. And on that car- pet, Robert Bly, portly, 65, squats cross-legged on a cush- ion, flanked by Marcus Wise on tablas and David Whetstone on sitar (two serious, handsome American boys in Indian dress) for an evening of traditional Indian poetry and dance. Bly looks quintessentially Bly: open-weave waistcoat; brilliant peacock cravat. The face, florid, fleshy, benign beneath a shock of luxuriant snow-white hair, could be any merchant banker's; but the voice is a mid-western drawl, singularly tuneless. No one wears shoes. Once upon a time, Bly read his poems alone - but he found the experience \"very dry.\" Then he read to the accompaniment of the dulci- mer - which he couldn't play. Now he is a master of ceremo- nies. The evening consists of an exploration of soul. Bly reads translations of poems by Kabir, Rumi, Maribai (15th and 16th century masters); short, ecstatic pieces that throw a bridge across from the con- scious to the unconscious mind. The ghostly sitar wails thinly; the tablas plink and pock; and above it all Bly's voice rides high, jocular, com- manding, a relentless, sacred and profane love-machine that often descends into gorgeous Americana: \"You play the flute well, and I love your swing curls and your ear locks.\" Bly's body rocks backwards and forwards, but the most expressive part of him is the hands - windmilling, weaving in the air, circling like the pis- tons of a steam train; fists beating on his knees. And those fingers: twitching, twirl- ing, fluttering, flitting about, casting spiritual spells. But it is Neena Gulati's clas- sical Indian dancing that brings the poetry alive, helping us to understand - by a sud- den, shocked look of fearful rapture in her huge, kohl- ringed eyes, or the way she stamps and judders her ankle- bells - how the Sufi mystics could speak about spiritual and carnal ecstasy almost in the same breath. As Maribai said and Bly intoned after her: \"All I was doing was breathing/ And the dancing energy came by my house.\" George Macbeth gave a virtu- oso performance, both as chair- man and poet, at the third Charterhouse Poetry Festival last weekend. There is a Yeat- sian panache about Macbeth. The dress is marvellously dan- dified, swashbuckling - from the stiff, upturned collar to the lace at the wrists; from the brilliant, polka-dotted waist- coat to the flamboyant cre- ations that flourish at his neck. He might even be some delightful curiosity out of Ten- niel's Alice in the way that his lank, grey hair seems to be fin- ger-combed forward and then wildly blown apart to reveal that mischievous, grinning face of his with its gappy, splayed teeth. And the voice is a continuing extension of his own fanciful sense of himself, swooping, grumbling, rum- bling, like some heavy vehicle moving across gravelly ground. It sounds like a mannered, drfunken, deeply cultivated drawl - but the man is clearly sipping mineral water. It is pure sound in its own intona- tions - irrespective of any meanings that the words may wish to convey. It can sud- denly pounce upon a word and savage it for no apparent rea- son. I wondered as I listened whether the language really deserved such playful violence. The words on the page seem plain and sadly quiet, innocent and unadulterated when we come to look at them later - not half so long or half so affecting as when intoned by that rolling, rollicking bardic voice. Towards the end of the read- ing, Macbeth recited a poem entitled \"Lady M\" from Tres- passing, a collection published since he settled in Ireland in 1988. It is a Yeatsian poem, indeed, all incantation. \"In a way, I see myself becoming a sort of belated Laureate of the Irish Ascendancy,\" he told us with a mock flourish. This technically various, copious poet could do that, too. Michael Glover",

   "text_content" : "EVERYONE must hope that yesterday's ceasefire agree- ment in Yugoslavia will hold. But no one can feel confident that it will. The terms of the agreement are very similar to those of several previous ones which conspicuously failed to hold. Two factors might encourage the parties to observe the agreement. One would be a hard-headed assessment of what they stand to gain or lose by further fighting. The Serbs might decide they have already achieved their main territorial objectives; the Croats, knowing they are hopelessly outgunned by the federal army, might well fear being completely overrun if hostilities continue. The other factor would be con- fidence that the other side is not going to take the offensive. Civilian monitors have failed to provide that confidence. In other conflicts the job has been done by peacekeeping forces, lightly armed but wielding authority in a buffer zone. Tomorrow member states of the Western European Union will consider sending such a force to Croatia. They should do so only at the request of all three parties, and if they are convinced there is a real desire on both sides for the ceasefire to hold. Other- wise the peacekeeping force will end up taking part in the war, as happened to the Multi- national Force in Lebanon. Flawed analogy Some will argue that that is what it should do. Croatia, they will say, is as much a victim of aggression and occu- pation as was Kuwait in August last year, and is as much entitled to assistance in asserting its sovereignty and recovering its territorial integ- rity. But that analogy is flawed, and the precedent is in any case double-edged. Most of the ground fighting against Iraq took place in unpopulated desert. Even so it had to be prepared with a devastating bombing campaign, and was followed by a civil war in Iraq far surpassing in its horror anything yet seen in Yugo- slavia. Does anyone seriously imagine that the EC, or the WEU, is ready to inflict that kind of punishment on Serbia, or that WEU troops could involve themselves in fighting in the ethnic maze of Croatia without encountering fierce resistance, and sustaining heavy casualties? Lebanon is indeed a better analogy than Kuwait. If Croats cannot be defended by external force, should they at least be allowed to acquire arms so that they can defend themselves? It is tempting to say yes. Yet there can be no guarantee that arms, once acquired, would be used responsibly or humanely in a region already bristling with them, where both sides are ani- mated by memories of massa- cres old and new, and by the desire for revenge. The more likely effect would be to pro- long, escalate and yet further envenom the conflict. What is needed is the disarmament of the Serb irregulars and the withdrawal of the federal army. The question is how. Hollow gesture Recognising Croatia's inde- pendence, however morally satisfying, would be a hollow gesture if not followed by prac- tical help. More to the point would be to withdraw recogni- tion from Yugoslavia, a federa- tion which has become nothing more than a cloak for Serbian expansion, and to insist that no Serbian fait accompli will be accepted, no government in Belgrade recognised so long as it uses or condones the use of force against any of the former Yugoslav peoples. Neighbour- ing countries - notably Albania, Greece and Bulgaria, whose concerns about Mace- donian independence are well known - should meanwhile be firmly warned against sending troops across the border. Some economic sanctions against Serbia are already in place. An oil embargo has been suggested. It would require UN authority. The UN Security Council should in any case be convened. The crisis now threatens international peace and security, which is what the Security Council is there to protect, and the head of state, Mr Stipe Mesic, has himself called for UN intervention. Europe, whose regional secu- rity institutions are still in an embryonic stage, should not be ashamed to admit, as other regions have done with other problems, that this one is too tough for it to solve on its own.",

   "text_content" : "FEW IDEAS are more firmly and insidiously entrenched in the mind of the British popu- lace than the belief that land, bricks and mortar constitute a fail-safe investment. That belief has been buttressed by the determined efforts of politi- cians to pamper the hom- eowner with subsidies and sis- cal privileges. Yet suddenly this central tenet of British realpoltik is beginning to look questionable in a period of pre- electoral fever. Not only has mortgage tax relief been trimmed; mortgage reposses- sions are threatening to top the 100,000 mark before the year is out. If the government is to re-establish the seriousness of its anti-inflationary credentials beyond reasonable doubt, it is vital that it resists the growing pressure for yet another bail- out in the housing market. Government bailouts have, in the past, been part of the natural rhythm of the eco- nomic cycle. In the aftermath of an excessive expansion of money and credit the authori- ties have invariably protected the homeowner by inflating their way out of trouble. More- over, while house prices fell in real terms in the recessions of the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, there was no decline in nominal prices. Homeowners continued to enjoy negative real rates of interest on their mortgages and a more general illusion of asset price stability. Sacred cow The unusual if not unique, feature of the present recession in Britain lies in the fact that nominal house prices have aln sharply, with declines of to 30 per cent in some parts Sthe cuntry coming to be regarded as the norm. Real rasof inaterest, Iar iom being negative, are stui, even after remen rate cuts, at their high- it level since the 19R30.

At a wider level it could be argued that a lack of confthis- dence in housing wil hold back economic recovery as accelerating repossessions fur- ther undermine house prices and hit the building societies. Mortgage cushion The counter case is that job- less homeowners are already cushioned, after 16 weeks out of work, from mortgage inter- est payments. Repossessions remain extremely low in rela- tion to a total owner-occupied housing stock of 15m; the shock lies in the novelty rather Sthe economic signifi- cance. It would, in addition, be absurd to have inflicted such a swingeig queee on borrow ers, only to throw away the disinflationary benefit at the last momeownet.

   "text_content" : "Roland dd on the managerial strategy of h iybidding Â£703m for Racal Williams do face their biggest test NIgSIII\"Ud Nta~ Rudd \"\"Brtm Mo.SS rL 1',Rudd. chairman l Holding, the austra coiiomerte Portugal, he ix^ not resist remark ing how Slr Ernest Hairlson. Recal's chplnian, was out of thescountry as news of tbbid was ainnounced. \"We seem to have caugt him on the hop,\" said Mr Riid. \"Oh dear, he will not be very pleased with us.\" Since Sir Ernest was on his way back to Englaid the response to Wil- liams's bid was left to Racal Electron- ics, which Issued a terse one-line statement telling its shareholders not to do anything until further notice. Yesterday was undoubtedly Mr Rudd's day. But as he was the first to admit, his offer of three new Williams shares for every 20 Racal Electronics shares - valuing the company at Â£703m - is likely to be rejected by Sir Ernest. The takeover battle has only Just begun. Mr Rudd believes that, notwith- standing the recent dearth of hostile bids, there is nothing out of the ordi- nary in an industrial conglomerate launching a hostile takeover - even if its target is worth just over a third of its own Â£2bn-plus market capitalis- ation. Yet Mr Rudd and his partner, Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, have come a long way in the past nine years - growing to become a group with international interests ranging from defence to fire protection and domestic security to engineering. In February 1982, from an office above a garage, the pair bought a majority stake in what Mr Rudd now calls an \"awful little company losing money\" called Williams and Son Hold- ings for Â£400,000. At first, they concen- trated on building up assets through acquisition. They bought car dealer- ships, to build up an earnings stream, and acquired foundries. Williams was born into a bull market, and as the acquisitions grew the City began to take more notice of the pair. The first big test came when they decided to acquire the Midland scrap dealer J&HB Jackson in 1984. At the time Williams had Â£10m of assets and Â£12m of borrowings compared to Jack- sons' Â£20m of assets and Â£8m of cash. Mr McGowan was determined not to borrow huge sums of money. \"I do not like debt - that is the way to to go bust\". Thus their bid, worth Â£30m, was in shares. It was a technique Williams has used more recently in much bigger deals: its Â£404m all-share bid in Febru- ary for Yale and Valor, the British security products company, and yes- terday's offer for Racal Electronics. Fear of debt has been a constant theme. It was this which prompted the sale of the Crown Berger paints business for Â£205m in May 1990, wip ing out Williams's borrowings. Fans of the company point to the fact that between 1982 and 1989 Wil- liams produced continuous profit growth. Recession accounted for the 14 per cent fall in taxable profits in 1990 but by August of this year the company reported a thumping profit increase of 26 per cent to Â£76.5m for the six months to June. However, Messrs Rudd and McGo- wan have had their critics. In the mid-1980s the duo were accused, in a way like Hanson, of being profit or earnings strippers: buying a company cheaply, digesting its profits but doing little to nourish organic growth. According to Mr Rudd, those critics have been proved wrong because Wil- liams has shown that it can improve both profits and margins of the busi- nesses it acquires. \"We are not inter- ested in just stripping out earnings,\" said Mr Rudd. \"We are interested in running businesses. We encourage management to have a fresh look at the company. They are more willing to flog themselves for you if they know you are personally committed to the business. I seem to have an ability to get people to work for me.\" A high degree of local management autonomy Is oacKea up Dy perror- mance-related bonus schemes which can account for more than a third of executive salaries. But decentralisa- tion is tempered by a refusal to accept failure. Mr Rudd warns: \"I have to be absolutely ruthless if they fail.\" Boosters of the Williams duo see the group's recent results as evidence of their management skills: apart from the overall profit increase, oper- ating margins on retained businesses rose from 15.5 per cent to 17 per cent cent - one of the highest margins of any sizeable UK quoted company. Mr Rudd and Mr McGowan comple- ment each other. Mr Rudd, ebullient and optimistic, enjoys chatting on the factory floor, but would not interfere with operating decisions. Mr McGo- wan, who says he loathes cocktail parties, is the organiser who likes \"to make things happen\". Mr McGowan is confident of mak- ing things happen again at Racal. Wil- Hams's management, which has just been restructured to take account of the recent acquisition of Yale and Valor, would be reorganised again if Its bid for Racal is accepted. Williams could also be forced by the Office of Fair Trading to sell parts of the Racal Chubb retail business because of its strength in that market through its recent acquisition of Yale and Valor. As to what will happen next, Mr Rudd will only say he is waiting until his \"Williams hit squad\", led by the group's managing director, Mr Roger Carr, has assessed Racal's businesses. Mr Rudd has less information to give about the business because, since this is not an agreed bid, he has obviously not been able to inspect the company he wants to buy. Williams has only ever made two hostile bids. Both failed. It pulled out of its bid for McKechnie Brothers, the UK plastics and metals group, in 1988, after McKechnie's board persuaded its shareholders to support its own bid for the Midlands building products business, Newman Tonks; Williams had made a rejection of the bid for Newman a condition for proceeding. In 1987 it came within a whisker of acquiring Norcros, the building, print- ing and retailing group, but failed to gain control as a result of its aggres- sive tactics: it brought its final closing date forward by a month, thereby truncating the whole bid period to five weeks. When the bid expired Wil- lams owned or had received accep- tances for 48 per cent of Norcros's shares. Williams has learned its lesson from that battle. \"I think you would have to be pretty brave to try that again,\" said Mr McGowan. Mr Rudd and Mr McGowan refuse to be drawn on their tactics in this battle, particularly on whether they are willing to raise the bid or add a cash element for Racal Electronics. Mr McGowan is adamant that the con- glomerate will not be pushed into overpaying for Racal. \"In the heat of the moment, when you want to acquire another company, it is easy to get carried away,\" he said. On the other hand, neither he nor Mr Rudd is prepared to contemplate failure in their latest bid. Although they maintain that that they do not need it to boost profits, they know that if they really want Racal they may have to pay more for it. The question is: will Mr McGowan be able to resist the temptation to pay over the odds?",

   "text_content" : "f Margaret Thatcher had a men- tal model of the mould-breaking entrepreneur, it might well have been Sir Ernest Harrison. In his 25 years as head of Racal Electronics, he has steered the company into one profitable growth business after another, thanks to shrewd opportun- ism and an ability to back vaulting ambitions with aggressive selling drive. But he never fully managed to dis- pel the suspicion that he was more salesman than industrialist. Despite sweeping claims, he failed to build the kind of industrial base or create the number of Jobs that would have cemented his reputation. The son of a London docker, he has never worried about trampling on convention. Indeed, he has seemed to delight in ruffling the industrial and financial establishments with a brash pride in Racal's achievements which often verges on arrogance. The City has responded equivo- cally. Many analysts have questioned how much substance lay behind the hype, particularly since the company seemed to lose momentum in the late 1980s. But in Racal's halcyon days, particularly the 1970s, their fulsome recommendations helped power the company's shares to dizzy heights. Racal employees, by contrast, have never shown any doubts. Sir Ernest's pugnacious style and his evangelical addresses to his troops - coupled with a prodigious enthusiasm for cor- porate hospitality - have earned him unshakeable loyalty. An accountant by training, he joined Racal in 1951, when it had 12 employees, becoming chairman in 1966. Two years later, Racal acquired Controls and Communications, a small UK defence communications business, paving its entry into the tactical military radio business. Racal concentrated on supplying huge volumes of basic equipment to developing countries, mainly in the Middle East Its meteoric success was reflected in soaring profits and sev- eral Queen's Awards for exports in the 1970s. Early in Mrs Thatcher's premiership, Harrison was rewarded with a knighthood. Well before military radio sales peaked, Sir Ernest was charting Racal's next growth phase, in data transmission equipment. Using US acquisitions as a springboard, it rode the booming market for inter-com- pany computerised communications until increased competition and tech- nological change drove the profit out of the business. Racal's third big growth period began in 1983, when it won a licence to build and operate a nationwide cellular telephone network in compe- tition with British Telecom. The prof- itability of cellular telephone systems exceeded all expectations, as Voda- fone's Â£3bn capitalisation bears wit- ness - though Racal's forecasts that it would create many manufacturing jobs were never fulfilled. Racal also made two sizeable UK takeovers - of Decca, a defence elec- tronics company, in 1980, and of Chubb, a security company, in 1984. Though sometimes derided as a super-salesman who invested little in research, Sir Ernest has shown a sure knack for spotting emerging applica- tions for electronic technology. Not all have paid off: Racal's much-trum- peted diversifications into marine oil exploration techniques and computer- aided design came to little. One reason why Racal may have tailed was that Sir Ernest and his management team spent too much Lime on the successful Vodafone busi- mess, denying the other businesses the attention they needed. These failures served only to increase the divergence between Sir Irnest's view of Racal and the City's. By late 1990, he was deeply fras- rated with what he saw as the mar- ket's consistent undervaluation of the non-Vodafone parts of Racal. So low had the value of these parts sunk that speculation about a bid for the company surfaced again. Sir Ernest's solution, after a hastily convened board meeting last Novem- ber, was to embark on one of the biggest corporate demergers. The original plan included distribu- tion to shareholders of Racal Elec- tronics' stake in Racal Telecom, the operator of the cellular phone net- work; flotation of Chubb, the security and locks business; and a manage- ment buy-out of the \"rump\" that was left. But as the complexity of such a demerger emerged, Sir Ernest had to' reduce its scope sharply. Shorn of the buy-out plans and the difficult Chubb flotation, the only question was how investors would value the Racal \"rump\". As the rise in the share price showed ahead of the demerger on' Monday, Sir Ernest's decision has been vindicated as a move to lift shareholder value. A company the market implicitly valued at next to nothing a year ago, yesterday attracted a bid worth Â£703m. But the demerger also triggered the very bid - Sir Ernest had been trying to avoid.",

   "text_content" : "a Events in the Soviet Union have taken some remarkable turns in the last month. Among the most surprising is the news that due to arrive in London from Moscow last night - apparently to resume his old job as Soviet ambassa- dor - was none other than Leonid Zamyatin. Zamyatin left the UK at the end of August under some- thing of a cloud. On the morning after the coup, he suggested rather publicly that it might be constitutional and that President Gorbachev was indeed not well. Later attempts to deny this were not very suc- cessful, largely because of the existence of tape recordings of what he had said. As a former press spokes- man for President Brezhnev, Zamyatin was sent to London in 1985 by Gorbachev as an honourable sort of exile. But it was no secret that he always kept contact with his old friends at home, so his appar- ent support for the coup was no real surprise; nor, therefore, his recall two weeks later. There was a lot of mystery last night over why he was returning, and for how lag.

   "text_content" : "From Mr MR Weale. Sir, Samuel Brittan (Eco- nomic Viewpoint, September 12) criticises a national savings target on the grounds that companies and individuals should be left to sort out the consequences of their own actions. The use of a national savings target as a guide to policy will not prevent this and is not intended to prevent this. It is not the case that taxes will be raised to bail out the debt- ors, but simply that the macro- economic effects of low saving will be avoided. In the late 1980s the combi- nation of the consumer boom and the pursuit of a budgetary target has led to a situation where many businesses and individuals have had to grap- ple with high interest rates not because they have mishandled their own affairs but because other people have. Interest rates may have risen slightly more for those who have attempted to live beyond their means but they rose for every- one. It is this externality which the national savings target is intended to address. As the aftermath of Mr Lawson has shown this cannot be dealt with by telling the government to balance its own budget. MRWeale, University of Cambridge, Austin Robinson Building, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DE From Professor A P ThirlwalL Sir, Samuel Brittan has writ- ten yet another article (Sep- tember 12) on why he thinks the current account of the bal- ance of payments doesn't mat- ter for a country's economic performance. This time, though, it is supposed to be the definitive statement, for he says \"it has taken several years to prepare the above few sentences, and interested read- ers might consider reading them several times in a moment of quiet\". He claims at last to appreci- ate the basic difference between those economists who take the idea of a balance of payments constraint for an advanced capitalist country seriously and those who do not. After several readings in the quiet, I understand his lais- sez-faire viewpoint, but he has inadvertently written himself into the opposition camp with- out realising it. After red herrings, such as faulty statistics and increases in the market value of overseas assets, his dismissal of the importance of the current account of the balance of pay- ments rests on the liberal belief that balance of payments deficits and associated borrow- ing are self-correcting in the same manner as excess domes- tic borrowing. He doesn't once mention the mechanism of correction. Excessive borrowing is cor- rected by deflation and high interest rates (determined by the government) which have social repercussions or exter- nalities extending far beyond the free choice exercised by economic agents concerning how much they wish to spend and borrow from abroad. Samuel Brittan recognises a currency problem and so falls into the opposition camp, because he concedes that cur- rency stabilisation is likely to involve high unemployment. That is exactly the point of the latter-day mercantilists; that balance of payments weakness has implications for the real economy because high interest rates retard growth and cause unemployment. It turns out that the differ- ence between Samuel Brittan and those who stress the importance of the balance between exports and imports for a healthy economy hinges on the efficacy of devaluation and on the Keynes versus Clas- sics debate on the relation between wage rates and employment at the macro level. But it is not sufficient then to say that the balance of pay- ments problem is, therefore, one either of the exchange rate or of excessive wages because we know from economic theory and experience that neither devaluation nor wage rate reductions can guarantee bal- ance of payments equilibrium and full employment. Perhaps one day Samuel Brittan will recognise that Britain has a payments prob- lem of a much more deep-seated structural nature which can be an independent constraint on real economic performance.

   "text_content" : "rwom Mr Tedo Japrodrze. Sir, It seems a pity that the reports on Georgia's desire for independence from the Soviet Union focus so much on local colour (though we are admit- tedly a colourful people) and so little on Georgia's overwhelm- ing case for recognition of our independence, an issue on which virtually all Georgians stand united. May I therefore ask that your readers be informed of the following facts that were missing from Leyla Boulton's story on the subject (\"Geor- gia's independence crusade turns into farce\", September 11), but which might help your readers understand us bet- ter? First, Georgians are not Rus- sians. Georgia has been a definable nation for well over 2,000 years, with its own lan- guage, literature, history and culture. We are all intensely proud of this heritage, which has not diminished despite var- ious foreign invasions over the centuries. After the collapse of tsarist Russia, which had been our most recent occupier, we again celebrated the restoration of our independence. By 1921 all the major nations of Europe recognised our sovereignty, as did the League of Nations - and even the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, our freedom was short-lived, as the Red Army invaded Georgia the same year and the Soviet Union announced its official annexation of Georgia in 1922. After 70 painful years of Soviet rule, the Soviet Union has collapsed and we are now simply asking for our country back. Under international law, we already meet every require- ment for recognition of our sovereignty. We have officially requested recognition from the United Nations, United States and other countries. Beyond the legal criteria, we believe we have an even more compelling moral case for rec- ognition. Georgia was one of the chief targets of Stalin's purges. Over 200,000 Georgians were murdered. Hundreds of thousands more were deported. A whole generation of leaders, lawyers, writers, teachers and other intellectuals was virtu- ally destroyed. There is hardly a family in Georgia that does not have bit- ter memories of this period. Most of us lost one or more members of our family. Soviet brutality towards Georgia continued as late as 1989, when the Red Army killed 20 innocent civilians in the Georgian capital. Their only crime was they were peacefully demonstrating for independence. In a referendum in March of this year, the Geor- gian people voted overwhelm- ingly for independence. And the following month our inde- pendence was officially pro- claimed. There is no question that we Georgian people deeply want our independence restored and that we meet all established criteria for recognition, includ- ing economic viability. Unfortunately, it seems that many western leaders are now so anxious to prop up what remains of the Soviet Union that they are withholding rec- ognition of Georgia's indepen. dence as a concession to Moscow. And there is certainly evidence that Moscow has had a heavy hand in the recent dis- turbances in Georgia, presum- ably to create the impression around the world that Georgia is not ready for independence. The fact is that we have been ready for restoration of our independence since the first Red Army troops marched into our country in 1921. Indeed, history may show the west's current prevarication on recognising our sovereignty as the true \"tragic farce\" of our time.

Sweden and Austria have applied for membership; Nor- way and Finland, and possibly Iceland, can be expected to fol- low suit; Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak federal republic have stated that forms of association cannot be a sub- stitute for full membership. Switzerland may not wish to be left out. The EC increas- ingly sees it as in its own best interest to admit Turkey. The wish of Cyprus and Malta to join will need to be considered.

A variant would be for the managing council concept to be invoked only at times when the full Council decides that crisis management is called for, such as in the event of a foreign policy crisis or a Coir- munity budget or trade issue. Second, there will be prob- lems with \"coercive\" decision- taking in the Community if majority voting means that more member states can be overruled. The dilemma is that a unanimity requirement could produce paralysis. One approach to this dilemma is to continue to restrict the operation of maor- ity voting. A second option is to maintain the urrent \"block- ing minority\" even in the larger Community. Another sapproach is to allow member states that are overruled to \"opt out\" of the policy con- Thidri, there will be a atr mued r an ecIent cdvi ser- vice strcture or the EC.

Conversely, an increase in size and cut in the number of repre- sentatives from individual member states will make it seem too remote from public opinion to be entrusted with legislative functions. Fifth, the need for economic logic to underpin net financial transfers within the Commu- nity will become even more pressing. Of the 10 potential new member states identified above, five should (on rational economic criteria) become net contributors to EC pro- grammes (the Nordic entrants and Austria and Switzerland). The others should become net reciplents. Under present poli- cies there is not only no guar- antee of such an outcome but evry prospect of an aggrava- tion r existing neuities.

The provi- sions in the draft treaty on political union to enshrine the doctrine of the acquis commu- nasutare, and to amend the EC treaty so as to extend the scope of majority voting and to give more political powers to the Commission are examples of proposals that will not be suited to the Community of 22 or more. There are some member states which argue that a reformed Soviet Union will enable other central and east European states to stay outside the EC. However, this will lead to divisions in Europe.

This prompted an ppeal last week to the British pbime minister from Mr Jalal Talaban,i one of the two main Kurdish leaders. Mr Talabani's claims were at first greeted with scepticism by British and US oficials, but have now been the UN Security Council for posed escrow account into which the oil revenues would be paid is an infringement of Iraqi sovereignty. The UN rep- resentative, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, sees this as prepar- ing the ground for \"a possible refusal to go along with 'intru- sive' arrangements for oil sales and monitoring of the distribu- tion of food and medical sup- plies\". * Last week Mr Saddam pro- voked the withdrawal of the UN inspection team investiga- ting his nuclear and unconven- tional weapons capability, by insisting that henceforth the team would not be allowed to use its own helicopters but must rely on those provided by the Iraqi armed forces. * Also last week, Mr Saddam fired the prime minister, Mr Saadoun Hammadi, whom he had appointed after the end of the Gull war. Mr Hammadi was \"the acceptable face of Baathism\", for those to whom such a concept is not a total contradiction. He had con- vinced some of his interlocu- tors that Mr Saddam was sin- cere in wishing to introduce a more liberal and democratic system in Iraq. Yesterday, however, Mr Sad- dam spelt out clearly and pub- licly something that most of us had long understood: there is no place for western-style democracy in Iraq under his leadership.

All these actions suggest that Mr Saddam believes the immediate post-war period is now over. He has weathered the storm. Most of the coalition forces have gone home. Now, he must think, is the time to reassert his control of the country by familiar methods and to cock a snook at those \"imperialists\" in the outside world who still believe they can interfere in Iraq's internal affairs. Or at least he is testing the limits on his freedom of action, in the hope that he can gradu- it is not 'Iraq' that is looking for a pretext to reject UN humanitarian measures, but Mr Saddam and his regime - and they are quite unrepresentative of the country ally whittle them away, as the attention of the world shifts elsewhere and people get used to the idea that he is going to remain in power. This is a challenge the world cannot afford to ignore. Indeed, there are encouraging signs that, at least on the matter of the UN inspection teams, it is not going to. On Monday it emerged that the US had drawn up plans to send armed multinational escorts to pro- tect the teams and was pre- pared to issue a new ultima- tum to Iraq through the UN Security Council. Mr Saddam promptly backed down at least part of the way, offering to allow UN helicopters inside Iraq, but warning that they should not \"compromise Iraq's national security\", notably by flying over certain areas of Baghdad. It is suggested that this pro- viso stems from Mr Saddam's fears for his personal safety. But one thing he has been very good at up to now has been concealing his whereabouts, and neither during nor since the war have the allies been willing to designate him as a target. By contrast, his own record of deceit and attempts to conceal his weapons pro- grammes, in violation both of the ceasefire terms and of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to which Iraq is a sig- natory, is massive and elo- quent. He has no standing whatever to make stipulations or place limits on verification procedures, and should not be allowed to. More insidious is the argu- ment over Iraq's humanitarian needs. There is no doubt that these are real. Both official and unofficial reports have detailed the shortages of food and medi- cal supplies, of power generat- ing and water treatment facili- ties, the high incidence of diarrhoea, the telltale signs of incipient epidemics. \"Iraq's men, women and chil- dren,\" writes Prince Sadruddin in the New York Times, \"should not continue to pay the price of a war they did not cause.\" He goes on, quite rightly, to put the blame for this appall- ing situation where it clearly belongs: \"It is hardly humani- tarian that the Baghdad authorities should arrogate to themselves the choice of dis- ease and hunger over compli- ance with UN requirements. It is their sovereignty - but their people's starvation.\" Yet he then proceeds to argue that the UN should back down, so that \"Iraq should not be handed a pretext to reject the entire UN package as an unwarranted straitjacket, with the effect of paralysing the United Nations' humanitarian operation\". This argument will not do. In the first place, it is not \"Iraq\" that is looking for a pre- text but Mr Saddam and his regime. That may sound like a piece of frivolous pedantry. Using a country's name to des- ignate its government is a familiar enough piece of jour- nalistic shorthand. But it can be a dangerous one, if it lulls us into forgetting that the gov- ernment in question is actually quite unrepresentative of the country. In the case of Iraq it is especially inappropriate because the UN has found itself obliged to distinguish juridically between the country and the regime, in a manner previously reserved for the whites-only regime in South Africa. In Resolution 706, passed on August 15, the Security Coun- cil ordered the establishment of the escrow account and the drawing up of \"a scheme for the purchase of foodstuffs, medicines and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs... and for all feasible and appropriate United Nations monitoring and super- vision for the purpose of assur- ing their equitable distribution to meet humanitarian needs in all regions of Iraq and to all categories of the Iraqi civilian population\". That resolution has been summarised not inaccurately as placing Iraq effectively under UN trusteeship. It is dis- couraging, therefore, that the man responsible for supervi- sing the UN's humanitarian efforts in Iraq still refers to Mr Saddam's regime as if it were synonymous with the country on which it has inflicted such terrible damage. Second, Mr Saddam is quite capable of finding pretexts for anything he wants to do, or indeed of acting without pre- text. If he objects to the escrow account, it is because he wants to get his hands on the money for his own purposes. If he refuses to sell oil, the UN should seize Iraq's ample sinan- cial assets in western banks, along with those of Mr Saddam himself and his family, and use them to purchase the food and medicine that is needed. No doubt many others have outstanding claims against Mr Saddam, but the UN, which represents the world commu- nity and has undertaken the task of redressing as far as pos- sible the damage Mr Saddam has done, should surely have first claim on his wealth to defray its own expenses.",

   "text_content" : "By Tony Walker in Cairo and Lonel Barber in Washington MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday stuck by his government's Insistence that Israel should shelve its application for $lObn (f5.9bu) in US loan guarantees until after a Middle East peace conference has been convened. A US official also warned that approval for the loan guarantees would not be auto- matic and could depend on Israel's attitude to the building of settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. The official, travelling with Mr Baker, said Arab states would boycott the proposed October conference if the US provided the loan guarantees without conditions. \"The Arabs would not show up, and who could blame them?\" he said. President George Bush last week threatened to veto the application if Israel continued to press for its immediate approval by Congress. Israel has requested the loan guaran- tees to assist in settling Soviet Jewish immigrants. During talks in Jerusalem, Mr Baker gave qualified under- takings that the US would not seek a further delay after Janu- ary and promised that the US would compensate Israel for any losses incurred as a result of the 120-day deferral demanded by President Bush. But the administration is clearly trying to tie approval for the loan guarantees to a commitment by Israel to stop building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories, a demand Israel has long rejected. The undertakings by Mr Baker were part of a six-point package presented to Mr Yit- zhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, in an effort to defuse the row over the loan guaran- tees. A senior US official told reporters on the flight from Tel Aviv to Cairo that the adminis- tration could not promise that loan guarantees would be approved in January, nor could it guarantee a specific amount. \"Israel wants us to agree that come January we would not ask for any conditions on this aid respecting the settle- ment practices. That's just something we are not going to agree to,\" he said. The senior official was quoted as describing the com- promise proposal as \"damned forthcoming\", and said the US would not bow to other Israeli demands. On his arrival in Cairo, Mr Baker said Washington would provide Jordan, Syria and Leb- anon with \"very detailed\" letters of assurances similar to those given to Israeli and Pal- estinian leaders. He said copies would be exchanged, once agreed. \"There will be no secrets,\" he said. Other elements of the six- point proposal presented to Israel include an undertaking that the administration would secretary or state james maKer (rignt) wm usraen prnme mmsnuter xmnaK onamur work with Congress to draft legislation on the loan guaran- tees, and that it would try to persuade other countries to provide loan guarantees. The administration has already asked Germany and Japan to consider future sinan- cial aid to Israel But Washing- ton may seek to make this international support - as well as its own approval of some or all of Israel's request for $10bn of loan guarantees - conditional on an Israeli agree- ment to freeze settlements in the occupied territories. \"It's a question frankly of not being able to justify in our own minds, or to the other par- ties in the peace process, an unconditional $lObn infusion that doesn't have any restric- tions [on settlements].\" Arab states have repeatedly asked Mr Baker to use US leverage with Israel to bring about a halt to settlements in territories occupied in the 1967 war. The US has declared set- tlements an obstacle to peace, but has stopped short of demanding a freeze.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Opinion Poll Cools Election Talk",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens and Ivo Dawnay AN opinion poll putting the Conservatives and Labour neck-and-neck yesterday took the froth off recent speculation that Mr John Major plans an autumn general election. Ministers continued to insist that the prime minister would probably delay until next year, but it emerged that Tory strat- egists have intensified contin- gency planning for an autumn election if the opportunity presents itself. For Mr Neil Kinnock, the poll provided a welcome, if only partial, respite after a spate of surveys pointing to a widening government lead. Speaking after an all-day strat- egy meeting of the shadow cab- inet, the Labour leader said there was \"no possibility\" that Mr Major would be able to sus- tain a stable or dependable lead in the polls. The latest survey, conducted by ICM for today's Guardian, puts Labour and Conservative support at 39 per cent with the Liberal Democrats at 17 per cent. In one respect it confirms the recent strong improvement in the government's position because the previous Guard- ian/ICM poll a month ago gave Labour a 9-point lead with 45 per cent against the Conserva- tives' 36 per cent. The results, however, contrast sharply with the 4 to 5 point lead for the Conservatives indicated by two polls last weekend. That will strengthen the con- viction of Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and of most other cabinet ministers that - barring a surge in support for the government over the next 10 days - Mr Major will have to rule out an election this year. Nevertheless, Mr Patten has told the prime minister that if that surge were to mate- rialise, the party's election manifesto and campaign battle- plan could be finalised early in October. Work on the mani- festo, which Mr Patten is draft- ing with Mrs Sarah Hogg, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, is said to be well advanced. Conservative central office has also made contingency arrangements to take prime poster sites throughout the country through October. Mr Patten's \"War Book\" for the campaign already includes a detailed strategy to target resources in key marginal seats and on winning the sup- port of blue-collar workers. For his part, Mr Kinnock said Labour's private polling had shown that it had suffered no slippage since June on its \"winning\" issues of industry policy, training and education and health. He went on to claim that any delay would act against the government as a consumption- led recovery laid the seeds for further inflation, as more hos- pitals and schools opted out of local control, and as poverty continued to worsen. Questioned on what more Labour needed to do, Mr Kin- nock singled out the promotion of its policy for reviving indus- try as \"the only coherent\" strategy for giving Britain a chance to be competitive. Earlier, officials said Labour's private polling, two weeks ago, showed the two parties levelon 40 per cent. Fixed-term parliaments, Page 7 Major's NHS pledge, Page 10",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans THE TICKET agency and corporate hospitality interests of Keith Prowse, which was placed in receivership a week ago, have been bought for an undisclosed sum by Wembley, the international leisure group and owner of the national foot- ball stadium. The deal concluded yester- day with Grant Thornton, Keith Prowse's receiver, means that corporate hospitality pack- ages for the Rugby World Cup and the golf Ryder Cup will be honoured. Other packages will be considered individually. The question remains, how- ever, who will bear the cost of theatre ticket vouchers bought through Keith Prowse agen- cies, as the failed company's debts have not been taken over by Wembley. London theatres, owed con- siderable sums for tickets, have agreed to continue to accept vouchers for the time being. They hope that credit card companies or the new owners of Keith Prowse will eventually help to meet the costs. Negotiations are expec- ted to start today between Wembley and the Society of West End Theatres (Swet). Mr Rupert Rhymes, Swet's chief executive, said: \"We will obviously be very willing to hear what they [Wembley) have to say. Obviously they will want theatre ticket alloca- tions in the future...there are therefore very good grounds for having a discussion.\" Sir Brian Wolfson, Wem- bley's chairman, said the com- pany had been involved in negotiations for a possible buy- out some weeks before Keith Prowse collapsed. The talks failed because \"there was a rather large difference in the sums we were talking about\". Now he believes he has got a bargain, although neither he, the receivers, nor Keith Prowse would disclose details of how much was paid. The companies sold to Wem- bley are Keith Prowse & Co, the ticket agency, and Keith Prowse Hospitality. The travel interests of Keith Prowse are not affected by the deal Expo- tel International, the hotel res- ervations agency, has already been sold by the receivers to the Modern Group, another agency. Some Keith Prowse ticket agencies, closed since the group collapsed on September 9, will reopen immediately and retain the Keith Prowse name. Nearly all the 150 staff employed by the two subsid- iaries will retain their jobs. Sir Brian said the deal was important for two reasons. It would secure the 20,000 hospi- tality packages for the Rugby world Cup, and it would strengthen Wembley's position in the international ticketing business. Wembley owns the complex in north-west London includ- ing stadium, conference centre and arena. It sells 4m tickets a year to events at Wembley, and through its interests selling cinema tickets in the US, claims to be the world's biggest ticketing operation. Its annual turnover is E175m."

   "text_content" : "By Robert Taylor in Stockholm and Emma Tucker in London DRASTIC CUTS in jobs and services at Sealink-Stena, one of Britain's largest cross-chan- nel ferry operators, are to be announced today, according to Stena, the company's Swedish parent. Stena, the world's largest ferry boat company, is facing a pre-tax loss of about SKr300m (Â£28.2m) this year, which it says is almost wholly attribut- able to Sealink-Stena operations. Unions and person- nel at Sealink, which employs almost 6,000 people in the UK, are being informed of the cuts this week, the company said. Stena acquired Sealink in February 1990 after a nine- month battle with Sea Contain- ers, the company's former par- ent. It immediately introduced cost-cutting and rationalisation measures, including a reduc- tion of 1,100 jobs. Sealink-Stena operates three cross channel services and three to Ireland. On the conti- nental side, Sealink, with its French partner SNAT, in which Stena has a 49 per cent stake, is the biggest operator after P&O European Ferries. In 1990 Sealink carried 7.2m pas- sengers compared to P&O's 11.6m. The takeover and rationals- ation costs cut Stena's profits last year by 60 per cent (after financial items) to SKr1O7m. Stena had predicted an improvement in its profitabil- ity during 1991, but has now sharply revised this view. Mr Lars Erik Ottosson, Stena group president and chief exc- utive officer said yesterday: \"Vigorous efforts are needed to reverse the downwards trend\". This would involve \"a drastc cut in the company's overhead costs\". The job losses at Sealink and abandonment of unprofitable activities are being announced as the company extends the rationalisation and cost savings programme it began last year. In July two new cnrehannel ships were added to the Salnk fleet as the final phase of Stena's initial invet- ant In Oeelink. Mr Ottosson said Stena hoped the ratimonwlsati po- graonme, with the measures idded last year, would result In svngs of SKir0m.

   "article_dc_title" : "Unlocking Racal Value",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Sir Ernest Harrison wanted to unlock the value in Racal Elec- tronics with Monday's demer- ger. Now he must be wonder. ing whether it was too much of a good thing. The Â£708m paper bid from Williams is unlikely to succeed in its present form, but the genie is out of the bot- tle. The problem for investors is that a bid premium is now so clearly in the Racal price that the market is no closer to an objective valuation of the company than it was before the demerger. At one level Williams looks like a natural buyer. Racal meets its usual criterion of being a loosely-managed com- pany with scope for margin enhancement. There is a closer fit between some of the busi- nesses than initially meets the eye. But Williams would have to dispose of the Chubb brand name to satisfy the UK compe- tition authorities. There must also be doubt about whether even it can push Racal's mar- gins up fast enough to justify a bid multiple of nearly 22 times current earnings. Admittedly, it may make more sense to value Racal against turnover rather than earnings. By that yardstick, the top price looks well over 60p. By bidding up Racal's shares as it did yesterday, the market is clearly expecting more than the 50%p which the Williams offer represented at the close. But Williams's resources are limited. Investors have an aversion to absorbing much more of its paper, while its own professed reluctance to incur debt leaves it little lee- way for offering cash. Much depends on whether another bidder can be per- suaded to enter the fray, though it would take some nerve at what look like increasingly rarified prices. Perhaps the eventual solution would be for Sir Ernest to sell Chubb before Williams can lay its hands on it. That would leave a smaller rump which Racal management would be better-placed to buy. But he had better hurry. Takeovers it almost feels like the old days, with Hanson, Williams and BTR all back in the take- over game. Conglomerates, though, have to make bids to keep their profits moving ahead. The question for the rest of the UK corporate sector is whether the opportunistic bids of the last two days will finally usher in a new era of merger activity. One effect of the recession has been to widen the gap i 1 r 1 1 i r 1 i i i 1 r i I 1 1 1 1 1 1 i between the strong and the weak. There will no doubt be many self-confident chairmen eyeing up a strong share price, sizing up a vulnerable competi- tor, and calculating the poten- tial boost to earnings per share over the next couple of years. The difficulty, though, remains that of calling the bottom of the cycle. In several stricken sectors - property and con- struction, for example - there would still seem to be no great hurry and every possibility that the next 12 months are going to be worse than the last. The stock market is already discounting most of the recov- ery so victims' share prices hardly look cheap. And though figures yesterday showed that corporate liquidity improved in the second quarter, the sinan- cial position of companies hardly seems strong enough to imply a wave of cash deals. On top of these considerations it seems unlikely that specula- tion about a November general election will encourage would-be bidders to bring for- ward their plans. Tesco The market is slowly becom- ing aware of a slowdown in sales growth among the lead- ing food retailers as a result of the recession and lower infla- tion. Hence, perhaps, the unusual interest in Tesco's interim figures yesterday. But the halving of sales growth in its existing stores to around 6.5 per cent was a poor excuse for marking down Tesco shares by 5 per cent. After all, the interim dividend was increased by 21 per cent, while operating margins rose by more than 10 per cent, enough to suggest Tesco can continue to benefit from its investment in technol- ogy for a while yet. Stripping out property, pre- tax profits were up by a third FT-SE Index: 2,5.4A (.11.6) Williams Holdings Share price relative to the FT-A AN-Share Index on the previous first half: Looking ahead on the same basis, Tesco could make S645m next year, which means the shares are on a bearish multi- ple of just 12. That seems cheap when one considers the real message of the figures. The food retailing industry appears to be taking its long-term shape faster than anticipated - good news for Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco, all of which can go on improv- ing margins, and perhaps for a couple of smaller players like Kwik Save and Morrisons. It is very bad news for Asda; but then its shares have fallen by 10 per cent this week. Fisons By marking the shares down 7 per cent yesterday the mar- ket showed its determination to focus on Fisons' mere 6 per cent advance in first half prof- its, rather than on its upbeat view of the future. That may yet prove short sighted but it goes to show that pharmaceuti- cal companies on dizzy ratings cannot afford to stumble. In this case the main problem has been the interruption of US sales of Opticrom and Imferon - a hiccup caused by tough new US regulatory require- ments but one which neverthe- less leaves an embarrassing hole above the line. There was also an unex- pected Â£5m swing in the sinan- cing charge, partly the result of a Â£70m first half cash out- flow, partly the consequence of a narrowing transatlantic in- terest rate differential. The result of the scientific equip- ment division shows that there has been a recessionary impact too. Fisons has an impressive record of double digit earnings growth; the sceptics prefer to focus on its cash flow record which net of finance charges, acquisitions and currency movements has not been good. Kingfisher Kingfisher's management might justifiably be peeved that the group's shares fell yes- terday. The interim trading performance was dependable. Market share increased in the main businesses and Wool- worths actually made a profit. Gearing fell from 35 to 22 per cent, albeit helped by partial exercise of convertible debt. With Comet and B&Q in its portfolio, the group is well positioned for economic recov- ery. The shares have a heady 18-month climb behind them, but perhaps deserve to be rated higher than the 15.5 sector average for next year.",

   "text_content" : "By John ThomhIll TESCO; the supermarket group, yesterday continued its seem- ingly relentless growth by regis- tering a 22 per cent gain in interim pre-tax profits. In spite of the recession and a laggardly summer trading period, Tesco increased taxable profits from Â£187.9m to Â£229.6m and lifted its operating margin from 5.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent. However, Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said sales were cur- rently running at lower levels than those achieved in the first half with a decline in volume of 1 per from comparable space after food price inflation of 5 per cent had been stripped out. However, he added that the company was continuing to gain market share and would benefit from increased productivity as a result of its heavy invest- ment in information technology. Tesco yesterday revealed that it was extending its sales-based ordering system for dry grocery products - which helps increase stock turnover and improve the availability of goods - from 94 stores to 230 before Christmas. Tesco is also experimenting with the ordering system on fresh food lines. It expects this investment to add Â£15m a year to prot over the nadt three years. During the 24 week to August 10, sale, excludi value added ta rose I2 nper cent to Â£.38bn. Just over hats this Increase came from existing store the rest was accounted for by als from new In the first hal, Tesco opened eight stores and will have added a further 16 by the year-end. However, four stores were closed during the period, leaving Tesco with 390 stores with a selling space of 10.1m sq ft. The company will add almost Im sq ft this year to be followed bya further 1.lm in 1992-93. Capi- tal expenditure amounted to Â£413m. Following the Â£572m rights issue this February, net borrowings stood at Â£45m at the end of the period. Sir Ian dismissed as \"non- sense\" the widespread reports that Tesco had begun a price war by launching its \"Why Pay More?\" discount campaign last month. But he said there had been a noticeably increased demand for its special offers. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 4 per cent to 8.4p. The interim dividend was lifted by 21 per cent from 1.65p to 2p. Lex, Page 20",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car maker, yesterday reas- serted its desire to stay indepen- dent following speculation that Mercedes-Benz or Volkswagen might be interested in buying a stake in the company. Porsche also confirmed that Mr Ulrich Bez, its research and development director, was resigning over the company's problems in motor racing. Mercedes-Benz (owned by Daimler-Benz) and Volkswagen said the question of them taking a stake in Porsche was not really an issue at the moment because the family-controlled company did not intend to become part of another group. However, both indicated they would be inter- ested if circumstances changed. Speculation over Porsche's future has revived after news of its worsening profits perfor- mance and falling sales, notably in the depressed US market. On Monday, Mr Werner Niefer, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz said, when asked on Austrian radio whether it might take a stake in Porsche: \"We will think about it\". Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive, said last week that Porsche would have to struggle to keep profits up to the depressed level of last year. The company has indicated that net income in the financial year to July 31, 1991, fell to between DM50m (217m) and DM60m from DM68.4m (a rise of 29 per cent on 1988-89). It is shedding 550 of its 8,000 employ- ees by mid-summer next year. Mr Bez, 47, is the third direc- tor to leave in the past year. Mr Bans Halbach, marketing direc- tor, joined Saab in Sweden and Mr Rudi Noppen, responsible for production and materials, went to run Webasto, a German vehicle parts manufacturer. Mr Bohn, a former director of Nixdorf - now owned by Sie- mens - joined in March, 1990."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller PROFITS at Fisons were cut by at least Â£10m because of prob- lems with the US Food and Drug Administration, Mr John Ker- ridge, chairman and chief execu- tive, said yesterday. The company reported first- half pre-tax profits of Â£95.2m - between Â£3m and Â£10m short of analysts' expectations. They had only been told about part of the disruption to production of two Fisons's drugs following changes in FDA requirements. The share price shed 35p to close at 464p. However, taxable profits at the pharmaceuticals, scientific equip- ment and horticulture group grew nearly 6 per cent from Â£90.2m. Turnover only inched ahead to L591m, from Le.i2m. Mr Kerridge said at least Â£10m profit was lost at the pharmaceu- ticals division because the FDA had become \"enormously pedan- tic\" in the wake of generic drug scandals. The drugs affected were Opti- crom, an anti-allergic eyewash, and Imferon, a blood product. Production at UK factories had had to be modified to meet new FDA requirements. Imferon was cleared last week and Opticrom is expected to be cleared by Octo- ber. However, operating profit at the division increased to eÂ£6.1m, from Â£60.6m, helped by improved market share for the asthma drugs in particular. Intal, for example, increased sales in the US by 24 per cent and in Ger- many by 16 per cent. It recently gained approval in Japan. He said research and develop- ment, \"which would not be cut under any circumstances\", was running at more than Â£100m a year, the bulk of it on the phar- maceuticals side. Scientific equip- ment, strengthened by the Â£270mn acquisition of VG Instruments early last year, showed modest operating profit growth to Â£27m, from Â£25m. Because it had some industrial customers, this division was the most vulnerable to recession, but pollution control markets had off- set the effects. Horticulture contributed 4A.4m, against Â£3.6m last time, with the help of acquisitions. Net debt rose from Â£115m at the year-end to Â£185m (at con- stant exchange rates), reflecting acquisitions and the disruption of supplies to the US. Parnings per share were flat at 10.4p after higher minority and tax charges. The interim divi- dend goes up to S33p, from 235p. Iax, Page 20 DrWgs etlook, Page 22",

   "text_content" : "New cars, familiar faces - Porsche's three model ranges have their roots in the 1960s and 1970s he willingness of Daimler- Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, to take a stake in Porsche illustrates the growing concern in German industry about the future of the luxury sports car maker. Porsche's opulent stand at this year's Frankfurt motor show has also acted as the backdrop for more sombre developments since the show opened last week. In turn, these have fuelled speculation about whether the fiercely independent Stuttgart car maker is losing momentum, and even whether it can survive the 1990s in the face of Japanese competition. The motor show also provided Mr Arno Bohn, chairman and chief executive, with the opportu- nity to announce a drop in earn- ings for the company's financial year ended July 31, coupled with a warning that Porsche is strug- gling to maintain sales and prof- its during the current year. His gloomy assessment of mar- ket conditions was followed on Monday with an announceinent that Porsche will shed about 6 per cent - or 550 workers - of its workforce by next summer. To make matters worse, Por- sche is losing its third key direc- tor in almost as many months, through the departure of research and development direc- tor Mr Ulrich Bez. With much of its reputation based on engineer- ing integrity, Porsche derives substantial income from contract R & D for other manufacturers at its Weissach research centre. Mr Bez, described as leaving immediately at his own request, follows the departure to Saab of marketing director Mr Hans Hol- bach and to components group Webasto of production director Mr Rudi Noppen. None of these developments means that Porsche is necessarily facing an imminent crisis. The company is cash-rich from the large profits piled up during the US market heydays of the 1980s. And its borrowings are negligible. To no one's surprise, representatives of the Piech and Porsche families - which control the company - politely, but quickly, declined Daimler-Benz's friendly offer. Porsche's 18 per cent fall in world car deliveries to 26,300 in its last financial year was not far from that experienced by other luxury car makers during the period. Yet the unpalatable fact for Porsche is that those sales were less than half what the company achieved in the mid-1980s. Sales peaked at 53,300 in 1985-86. While Porsche finance director Mr Walter Gnauert is quick to point out that the product range is now more profitable following the demise of cheaper models like the 924, the underlying picture is worse than even these figures suggest. Were it not for the post-unifica- tion sales boom in the German market, where sales of new cars overall are running more than 50 per cent up on year-ago levels, Porsche would now be in trouble. he company has made much of the fact that it reduced its former over- whelming dependence on the US. The world's biggest single lux- ury car market accounted for 70 per cent of Porsche sales as recently as 1967. Now, says Mr Gnauert, it accounts for only 23 per cent. Germany has taken over the lead with 40 per cent, and the remaining 37 per cent is well spread through the rest of the world. Porsche attributes this to stra- tegic planning. Its success in exploiting the Japanese market's new-found penchant for chic European luxury cars certainly fits into this category, witnessed by 15 per cent of total sales - 3,900 units - in Japan last year. It can equally be seen as hav- ing been forced on the company by wealthy American buyers deserting the marque in droves. By any measure, Porsche's recent US performance has been disastrous. In 1986, it sold a record 30,471 units in the US. Two years later the total was down to 15,732. Last year it sold 9,139 and in the first eight months of this year only 3,151 were sold. At this rate Porsche's 250 US dealers will do well to sell more than 5,000 cars between them this year. Mr Gnauert suggests that the arrival in the final two months of this year of the latest 968 model - and a further updated version of its largest, V8- engined 928 GTS - should lift sales above 6,000. This US collapse has led Por- sche Cars North America to cut its 350 staff by 25 per cent from the start of the month. Porsche, like other European makers, puts most of the blame for the collapse on the luxury goods tax imposed by the US gov- ernment at the start of this year. Some critics, pointing to the fact that Japanese luxury makes like Lexus and Infiniti are enjoy- ing unchanged, or even increased, sales this year, suggest other factors may be at work. Chief among them, some sug- gest, is that while Porsche was content to reap rich profits from the US during the 1980s - when Japanese competition was starting to emerge - it has done too little new product develop- ment to ensure customer loyalty now that Japanese rivals are coming into the market at cheaper prices. Porsche executives reject this, pointing to the latest 968 model and recent Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 derivates of the 911 as being extensively re-engineered to the point they could be designated \"new models\". The argument has received rel- atively short shrift from influen- tial car consumer magazines like Road & Track in the US and Car in Europe. The underlying concern for Porsche now is that it may not be able to bring on new products fast enough to prevent it suffer- ing a slow financial haemorrhage as more aggressive and larger Japanese rivals compete for its market niches. Mr Gnauert and his colleagues insist that such fears are unfounded, and that this will be demonstrated in 1993 when Por- sche will launch anew car. Germany's bigger car compa- nies will be watching develop- ments with close interest. Both BMW and Volkswagen are also likely suitors should the Piech and Porsche families, who con- trol all the ordinary shares and 40 per cent of non-voting prefer- ence stock, decide in the end that the game is not worth the candle.",

   "text_content" : "By Jan Puller MB-CARADON, the building products, packaging and print- ing concern, limited its pre-ta profit fall to 12 per cent, from 453.4m to Â£47.2m, in the flirt half of 1991. Turnover declined to Â£3S5.5.n (358.9m). In building products, which is largely UK-based, operating profit slipped to Â£29m (Â£31.5m) on sales of Â£256.9m (Â£270.3m). Mr Peter Jansen, chief execu- tive, said the impact of the UK recession had been counter- acted by the strength of its brands - including Everest double glazing and Twyfords bathrooms - and by holding prices. On the Continent, the radia- tor business enjoyed strong sales in Germany. He said there was increasing anecdotal evidence of an improvement in UK conditions, \"but no upturn in volumes yet\". Cost reductions included the shedding of 1,000 jobs, provided for when the rump of MB acquired Caradon in late 1989. This followed the merger of the packaging interests of Metal Box and Carnaud, of France, to create Europe's largest packag- ing group. MB-Caradon owns 25.1 per cent of CMB Packaging and last year the profit contribu- tion fell 14 per cent. In the first Pey nusmuwy Peter Jansen: no upturn in volumes yet half of this year the decline was reversed and MB took a Â£17.9m share of CMB's profit, the same as the first half of last year. Mr Jansen said that the management reorganisation, announced last week, showed that MB had influence over the business and that it was work- ing closely with its French partner, the investment com- pany CGIP. The US cheque printing busi- ness had suffered some disrup- tion during the merger of the two businesses, and exchange rates had also moved against it. Operating profit fell to 211.8m (Â£14.2m). Net debt rose to Â£229m (E219m), compared with share- holders' funds of nearly Â£500m at the year-end. Interest costs were Â£lL5m (10:2m). Vully-dilutedearnings fell to 7.1p (8.lp). The interim divi- dend is maintained at 2.75p. MBCaradon has kept its nerve through the building products recession and held prices, which has not only limited the damage but also puts it in a good position once volumes return. But in spite of encour- aging anecdotes, that is not expected to happen until early next year. The cheque printing side should have a much better second half, helped by a more favourable dollar-sterling rate. With CMB reviving even before MB and its partner took it by the scruff of the neck, this should leave full-year pre-tax profit intact at about Â£102m. The expected tighter manage- ment of CMB will either make it a better investment for MB, or a more saleable commodity if MB wants cash to expand its building products business. If the latter is its intention, leav- ing it too long could mean missing bargains among belea- guered rivals. After a strong run, the stock is on a prospec- tive multiple of just over 16 on yesterday's close of 250p, leav- ing little room for short-term improvement.",

   "text_content" : "By Chris Tighe THE NUMBER of quoted companies in north-east England has declined signifi- cantly in the past decade, mak- ing the region increasingly dependent on decisions taken elsewhere, according to a sur- vey by chartered accountants and business advisers Price Waterhouse. The survey said 26 quoted companies were headquartered in the region, seven fewer than 10 years ago, but only 10 of the 33 recorded in 1981 appeared on the 1991 list. Of the 23 no longer region- ally headquartered, 15 were taken over by companies based elsewhere, six ceased trading - mostly due to receivership - and two relocated. The survey said 16 locally- headquartered companies not quoted in 1981 came to the market during the decade, but, with the exception of the priva- tised water and electricity com- panies, they remained smaller than their predecessors. According to the survey, quoted companies head- quartered in the north-east employed 37,000 people and generated total turnover of more than Â£3bn. Just five com- panies - Northern Electric, Northumbrian Water, Vaux, Cowies and Barratt Develop- ments - accounted for 75 per cent of turnover and 59 per cent of employees. Since the survey was com- pleted one of the 26 companies, Ramar of Crook, Co Durham, has gone into receivership.",

Turnover for the six months to end-June fell by 7 per cent to E88.5m (Â£95.5m), a third still derived from the US. Operating profit fell by only O0.4m to 222.3m because of farther cost savings from the integration of Crosby, bought in 1989 for $65m (237.3m). Net Interest received rose to Â£1.5m (Â£600,000). Net cash bal- ances soared to Â£34.1m in June 1991 from Â£8m a year earlier and Â£16.8m at the year end Business Advisory Services, made a small undisclosed profit in the three months it was included and its sale pro- duced an extraordinary item of Â£21m. Last month Proudfoot announced that it was buying the largest Scandinavian con- sultancy, Indevo, for Â£12m in cash to bolster a region where the company had been weak. Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, said that the com- pany would continue to look for acquisitions internation- ally of about Indevo's size.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston BRENT WALKER's banks are today expected to rebuff the tentative takeover offer from Lonrho and will attempt to resuscitate the original refi- nancing proposals formulated by the troubled leisure and property group to avoid receiv- ership. The steering committee rep- resenting Brent Walker's 47 banks is meeting this morning, when its formal decision will be taken. But bankers on the steering committee, which is led by Standard Chartered, said they were likely to scup- per Lonrho's proposal. If they refuse to allow Lon- rho to proceed, Brent Walker's only hope of avoiding receiver- ship is to persuade holders of Â£100m of convertible bonds to drop their opposition to a refi- nancing package. Hill Samuel, Brent Walker's merchant bank, will offer the bondholders an improved stream of income on the prefer- ence shares they would receive in the refinancing. \"More income is of no inter- est to us\", said one bondholder. \"The preference shares are worthless anyway. What is the point of having more of some- thing that is worthless.\" However, an adviser to Mr Michael Smurfit, the Irish busi- nessman who owns 10 per cent of the bonds, said Mr Smurfit would be keen to negotiate improved terms in a refinanc- ing. He countered suggestions that Mr Smurfit was firmly wedded to Lonrho's plan. Brent Walker is delighted by the stand taken by the banks. It has consistently shown a preference for the refinancing package over Lonrho's take- over plan. It told the banks it was unable to negotiate with bondholders on new refinanc- ing terms while the bond- holders were distracted by the prospect of the Lonrho take- over. Brent Walker and its banks had told Lonrho they would block its takeover plan unless it met some tough conditions. They told Lonrho they wanted to receive concrete takeover terms this week. However, Lonrho is insisting on. carrying out an inspection of Brent Walker's assets, which would last between two and three weeks, before offering irrevocable terms. \"Would you buy a house without doing a search?\", asked Mr Paul Spicer, a direc- tor of Lonrho. However Lonrho said it would provide finance to Brent Walker to keep it going during this inspection, a process known as due diligence. But it wanted to have first claim on the company's assets, ahead of the banks, to recoup any money it injected, in the event that it did not make a formal offer. \"That is not on\", commented one member of the steering committee. \"Lonrho has to demonstrate that it is prepared to suffer some pain.\" One of Lonrho's advisers countered that the security it was demanding for the money it would inject into Brent Walker was no different from the security the banks were taking for the money they were putting into the company.",

   "text_content" : "By Joel Klbao ABERFOYLE Holdings, the agriculture, textile, security products and services group, yesterday faced the prospect of going into administration after refinancing talks had been suspended. The company, where a group of shareholders recently called for an extraordinary general meeting to replace the board, refused to say why the talks had broken down but said its financing was \"presently dependent upon a facility pro- vided by Aberfoyle's chairman and his related interests.\" The company is now making approaches to the dissident shareholders, thought to con- trol more than 40 per cent. But it warned that failure to secure finance could mean that it \"will seek an order to be placed into administration\". The move by Aberfoyle appears to have taken the group of aggrieved sharehold- ers by surprise though Mr Barry Trowbridge, the dissi- dent's candidate for managing director, said: \"We welcome the chance to meet with the company. We can at last get some information about its true finances.\" The group includes Crescent Africa, a private company with a 26 per cent stake, whose chairman, Mr Kojo Owusu- Nyantekyi, first called for the board's removal two years ago.",

   "text_content" : "F WJLLiAMS's Â£703m 'bid for Racal Electronics is successful, the acquisitive Derby-based conglomerate will be taking on an eclectic assort- ment of businesses. Racal's interests in seven divisions cover security, data communications, radio commu- nications, marine and energy, defence radar and avionics, specialised businesses and net- work services. On a pro-forma basis, sales of these businesses in the year to March 1991 would have been Â£1.55bn from which the com- pany would have incurred pre- tax losses of Â£21.8m. This compares with profits of Â£36.6m in 1990 and Â£93.3m in the previous year. By far the most important part of the remaining Racal \"rump\" is the security busi- ness, which in 1991 accounted for Â£648m of sales and Â£44.7m of operating profits. This division encompasses electronic and manned secu- rity, fire protection, commer- cial, domestic and motor locks and safe equipment. It is this business which Williams is most interested in. Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams's chairman, said yesterday that had he received an approach from Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman and chief executive of Racal, Williams would have been a willing buyer of this business. for navigation ana mgnt managemenr He received no approach and did not believe that any approach from Williams would have been welcomed. The business is seen as mature but highly cash genera- tive, and Mr Rudd says there is considerable scope to increase margins. At Yale and Valor, the secu- rity company bought by Wil- liams in March this year, mar- gins were about 10 per cent before it was bought, and have already been raised to 15 per cent. Mr Rudd says Chubb's mar- gins are even lower than Yale and Valor's were before the acquisition. Of the other businesses, the marine and energy division was the largest contri- butor to operating profit with Â£14.9m from only Â£137m of sales. Analysts say this has been a surprisingly good performer recently, particularly fom its servicing of the oil exploration market. The radio communications division was the only other contributor to profits, having had what could be termed a \"good\" Gulf war. The radios were widely used in the con- flct and Racal has an assem- bly plant agreement in Saudi Arabia. Operating profits of this divi- sion were Â£11.4m from Â£144m of sales in the year to end-March. After these profitable busi nesses come the loss-makers, led by network services, which supplies, owns and operates data communications between 21 government departments with 55,000 users. The service has absorbed sig- nificant amounts of cash in its development stage but is becoming less demanding as installation has almost ended. Nevertheless, the loss in Jan- uary of the opportunity to sup- plement the service with a gov- ernment contract to supply a voice network dramatically reduced the potential of the business. Analysts forecast that it is likely to turn in profits shortly. Data communications has also been a significant drain, losing Â£12.1m on sales of Â£321m. This business has faced a particularly tough time in the US where competition is very tight. It is one area Williams might be thinking of selling, analysts say. The other is defence radar and avionics, which made losses of Â£412,000 on sales of Â£127.4m. This division, though a \"fit\" with Williams's defence business, is currently suffering from the tough post-cold war spending environment.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Restructuring and Falling Demand Put AB Elect in Red",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto FALLING DEMAND and hefty restructuring costs were blamed for the fall into pre-tax losses of Â£6.27m by AB Elec- tronic Products Group, the electronic components manu- facturer based in Glamorgan, in the year to June 30. The previous year had shown a profit of Â£11.13m. There is a proposed final div- idend of O.1p (17.5p) after the interim was passed. And the group warned of a projected loss for the first three months of the present year as the current order intake remained weak. Further cost-cutting measures were planned. Trading profit for the period under review slumped to Â£8.66m, compared with Â£24m on1 turnover down from Â£261.3m to Â£213.4m. There was an exceptional charge of Â£2.35m this time resulting from redundancies and rationalisation costs. Dur- ing the year the group shed 1,500 jobs, and the workforce has been reduced by a further 400 since the year end. There was an extraordinary charge of Â£3.5m (Â£2.54m) also relating to restructuring costs. Sir Peter Philips, chairman, said that the cost base had been reduced substantially through the restructuring and rationalisation programme, lowering the break-even point. The group's businesses were being focused on contract assembly and automotive elec- tronics. The customer base had been successfully expanded, particularly in the automotive, telecommunications and con- sumer sectors, Sir Peter said. Efforts were also being made to reduce reliance of the con- tract assembly business on the computer industry. Borrowings were Â£28.9m at the year end, for gearing of 75 per cent. This is expected to fall in the current year through further working capi- tal reductions, cash inflow and tax credits and depreciation exceeding capital expenditure, the group said. Losses per share were 13.4p (28.4p earnings). * COMMINT The fall into loss was more or less as anticipated, and atten- tion was focused on AB's efforts to pull out of its dol- drums. These have been stren- uous, with 1,900 redundancies, the closure of three factories and the disposal in April of Page, the aerospace and defence product business. Although there is little pros- pect of a substantial upturn in the near future, the City appears to judge the group's recovery potential as being fairly good. Forecast profits of Â£1.7m gives earnings of 4.1p against a share price of loo100p which makes the multiple meaningless. Itowever, .the group's balance sheet is intact, with borrowings actually down from the interim stage. It has net asset value per share of 140p and given that the recov- ery prospects are there, the shares should probably be closer to that figure.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "y PUggy Hollinger BRAKE BROTHERS, Britain's largest suppler of feozen food to the catering trade, bued the hrend of a declining sector to report a 12 per cent rise in underlying sales growth and an advance of almost 11 per cent in interim profits. Mr Frank Brake, managing director, said the hatup had achieved the increases by broadening a cst bae. The group, which is estimated to have about 15 per cent of a highly fragmented UK market worth about Â£1.Sbn a year, increased pre-tax profits from SU8m to Â£6.95m. Turnover for the six months to June 30 rose 16 per cent to Â£103.5m. More than 3 per cent of the improvement in sales was due to acquisi- tions, leaving underlying growth of 12.4 per cent. Mr Brake said all divisions of the business had performed well: \"It was Just the day-in day-out graft of moving the company forward which produced the results.\" Margins suffered slightly, falling from 7.2 per cent to 7 per cent, due to the squeeze in the catering sector. Mr William Brake, chairman, warned that the second half would continue to reflect difficult trading conditions. However, the company aimed to continue developing its facilities, with capital expendi- ture of some Â£12m planned for the year. About Wim was spent in the first half, compared to Â£t.6m last time. The largely cash acquisitions of fresh fish suppliers, Midflsh and WH Hooper, had had a neutral effect on profits. The chairman said the businesses had given Brake Bros \"a valuable entry into an important sector of the market\". The group said there was a possibility of more acquisitions in the second half. \"There is greater opportunity for expansion that way than there has been in the past,\" said Mr Frank Brake. Earnings per share rose to 10.1p (8.9p) and the interim dividend is up from 1.5p to 1.65p. * COMMNT There is no doubt that Brake Brothers has boosted its market share in extremely tough conditions: and, with just 15 per cent at the moment, there is a lot more room to grow. Long-term investors will be further drawn to the group's reputation for sound management, its track record - 20 per cent earnings growth per annum in recent years - and its cautious but steady acquisition policy. However, the bears question whether the full value is already in the share price which last night closed up 6p at 400p. Forecasts are pinned at about Â£16.2m, giv- ing a prospective p/e of 17. What happens next year depends on recovery in the sector, of which there is as yet not even a peep. Still, Brake's record seems to show it will benefit quite nicely from any pick up. It appears to be a fairly good bet in the long-term for those who can lay their hands on the tightly-held stock.",

   "text_content" : "By John Thonmhill A GAME OF musical chairs was played in the boardrooms of two FT-SE Index retailers yesterday as both Sears and Asda announced managemenit changes. Asda, the Leeds-based food retailing group which lost its chairman and chief executive when Mr John Hardman .quit in June, announced that it had appointed Mr Patrick Gillam as chairman. The 58-year-old Mr Gillam was previously chair- man of BP Oil. But Asda still had no news about recruiting a new chief executive, an appointment many analysts view as being essential before a much- needed rights issue can be launched. The company has come under strong pressure from its rivals in the food retailing sec- tor and faces an uphill struggle in reviving confidence in the City. Its shares were knocked again yesterday and closed 5p down at 94p. Mr Gillam, who spent 34 years at BP, will succeed Sir Godfrey Messervy following Asda's annual meeting today. Sir Godfrey had been appointed as an interim chair- man following Mr Hardman's departure but was hampered in his role by a mild heart attack. He has since recovered and ILnLI oIuLuIII U will resume his former role as a non-executive director. Mr Frank Knight, a deputy chairman of United Biscuits, will also join Asda today as a non-executive director. He has extensive executive experience at a range of food and con- sumer products companies. Sears, the retailing group which includes Selfridges, Olympus and Dolcis, confirmed yesterday that it had recruited a new chief executive to suc- ceed Mr Michael Pickard when he retires next March. He is Mr Liam Strong, 46, who announced on Monday that he was to leave British Airways, where he was direc- tor of marketing and operations. Mr Strong will join the Sears' board in November to learn about the business. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, Sears' chairman, said: \"At this stage in our corporate life we need to look closely at con- sumer needs and customer ser- vice. Liam Strong can bring a lot more to the party.\" Mr Pickard, who has been chief executive since February 1988, is to become chairman of the London Docklands Devel- opment Corporation.",

Profits at Trinity's UK news- papers, based in north Wales and the north west of England, were held to 90 per cent of last year's level. The performance of the newspaper division, better than many regional rivals, was helped partly by the fact that the titles are not unduly dependent on classified adver- ising which has plummeted. Interim profits increased at Trinity's packaging business, partly because of lower raw material prices. In North America, profits were down by about 40 per cent because of recession.

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nlkamoto BRITISH Polythene Industries, the largest producer of poly- thene film products in the UK, is buying Courtaulds Plastic Films for Â£9.14m cash. BPI is also launching a Â£15.4m rights issue to fund the takeover and reduce borrow- ings. Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive of BPI, said the acquisition of CPF would give the group access to new markets in the UK and Europe. The announcement came as BPI reported a 12 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Â£4.53m (Â£4.06m). The rights issue of 5.6m new ordinary shares is priced at 285p per share on the basis of 2 for every 9 ordinary shares and 313 new ordinary shares for every 3,000 existing convertible preference shares. The shares closed yesterday at 354p, up 8p The acquisition of CPF marks a step forward in BP's strategy of focusing its operations on the processing of polythene film. It is its third acquisition this year, following that of Gaynor Group, which it bought from the receivers in March for Â£1.5m and the polythene indus- trial building film business of Courtaulds bought for Â£150,000. CPF, which produces plastic and speciality films, saw oper- ating profit of Â£l.3m (Â£1.66m) on turnover of Â£24.9m (Â£22.7m) in the year to end-March. The assets being acquired by BPI have an agreed value of Â£7.45m. BPI expects to pursue acqui- sition opportunities to strengthen its core business in the UK, Mr McLatchie said. Although it is the largest UK polythene film producer, it still has less than 25 per cent of the highly fragmented market. The 12 per cent profits rise was helped by efficiencies gained from a substantial rationalisation programme which provided economies of scale and more flexibility in responding to customers' demands. As a result, operating mar- gins, at 7.5 per cent, were higher than margins of 5 to 6 per cent seen two years ago in a more resilient economy. The rights issue, meanwhile, should help bolster the balance sheet by bringing borrowings down to approximately Â£12m and gearing down to about 20 per cent from just over 50 per cent currently. Fully diluted earnings per share were up to 11.27p (9.73p) and the dividend is maintained at 3p. The group currently intends to increase its dividend for the full year, it said. * COMMENT The management of British Polythene deserves high marks for a robust performance in a very difficult period. The oper- ating margins achieved reflect the group's success in realising considerable efficiencies. Mean- while, acquisitions have boosted its raw materials pur- chasing power. There is a slight concern about the group's one product business and that expansion will even- tually run out of steam. How- ever, in the short term, its acquisition of CPF makes sense and the rights issue at a 16 per cent discount to the opening price looks attractive. Forecast profits of Â£9.9m for the year gives fully diluted earnings of 24.46p and a pro- spective multiple of 14 on yes- terday's closing price of 354p.",

Mr Pierre Bonelli, group managing director, warned that with the level of interest the company was paying it was inevitable that it would have to make a cash call within two years to provide a firmer sinan- cial cushion. He also warned that substan- tial costs associated with the establishment of BAeSema, the joint venture with British Aerospace, together with high research and development costs, would inevitably have an impact on the second half when Sema would normally expect to make most of its prof- its. Operating profits were up from Â£7.72m to Â£8.1m, but an increase in net interest charges from Â£391,000 to Â£1.39m depressed the pre-tax figure. Revenues rose to Â£201m, a rise of almost 6 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 4.5p to 4.7p after tax of Â£1.33m(Â£2.84m)and an interim dividend of Ip is declared, against 0.9p last time. Debt equity ratio, which stood at 53 per cent in 1990, had been brought down to 34 per cent in the period. Sema took the unusual step this year of publishing its \"book to bill\" ratio - the ratio of orders taken to turnover - for the preceding six quarters, showing a distinct improve- ment in the second quarter of this year.

The company saw a 22 per cent rise to Â£26m in cash flow during the period and a 21 per cent increase in oil and gas production to 23,651 barrels a day (b/d) after the second stage of development at the Wytch Farm onshore oilfield in Dorset came onstream. Clyde said its sterling oil price over the period was Â£11.38 per barrel compared with Â£10.66 in the same 1990 period. Gas prices were also well ahead of last year, but the com- pany expected them to drop by 5 per cent in the second half. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said the company had made an exciting discov- ery of gas in the Waalwijk onshore field in the Nether- lands during the first half which could lead to other gas finds in the area. Clyde which holds about 60 per cent of its reserves in the UK and 40 per cent in the Netherlands - split roughly equally between oil and gas - is looking to increase expan- sion overseas.

A severe recession in the advertising industry forced the group into pre-tax losses of Â£307,000, compared with a profit of Â£1.25m last time. Turnover was down 18 per cent to Â£23.2m, partly due to busi- ness disposals. The shares, which have fallen from 220p just over a year ago, closed 2p down at 64p. \"Making a loss is the corpo- rate equivalent of shock ther- apy. It can either kill or cure,\" said Mr Nick Winks, chief exec- utive. He added, however, that the recession had had beneficial effects as the group had been forced to cut costs and improve customer relations. Staff had been reduced by 20 per cent, while capital expenditure of E1.5m had helped to boost capacity by 15 per cent. \"The lower costs and increased capacity will leave us very geared for any recov- ery in the market,\" said Mr Winks. He added that fierce competi- tion had depressed gross mar- gins by about 8 per cent and orders by 18 per cent. The mar- ket as a whole had declined 13 per cent in the first half. Net debt was about f6m at the interim stage. Interest charges were down from Â£505,000 to Â£393,000. Gearing, which was 19 per cent at end of 1990, should be between 50 and 60 per cent at the, close of the current year, Mr Winks said.

Hinton, which employs almost 300 staff, achieved aver- age annual pre-tax profits of Â£678,000 between 1987 and 1990. Willis has been expanding its fee-based risk management activities as part of a strategy designed to reduce dependency on more volatile commission- based income. Willis Wrightson, its UK direct insurance broking sub- sidiary, began offering risk management services on an \"unbundled\" basis - charging for advisory services sepa- rately from insurance broker- age - earlier this year. Fees now account for 30 per cent of Willis Corroon's UK income. Last week Willis acquired Facciani and Sons of the US, an employee benefits concern based in the mid-west. Mr Rodney Meere, chairman and chief executive of Hinton, will continue as chairman. He is also a director of Willis Wrightson and chairman of Willis Wrightson Risk Manage- ment. Willis Corroon also announced that it is to change its name to Willis Corroon Group as part of its global reor- ganisation. All direct risk man- agement and insurance brok- ing activities will operate under the name Willis Cor- mnn",

   "article_dc_title" : "Jeyes Climbs 19% after Strong Overseas Advance",
   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger HELPED BY a strong advance overseas, Jeyes Group, the manufacturer of household cleaning products such as Par- azone bleach, maintained its recent record of consistent growth with a 19 per cent rise in interim profits. The USM-quoted group, which was turned round fol- lowing a management buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes in 1986, lifted pre-tax profits from Â£1.48m to Â£1.76m for the 28 weeks to July 13. Mr Jimmy Moir, managing director, said a 33 per cent rise in overseas sales had been the driving force behind the perfor- mance. The launch into Japan and the Middle East in the last quarter of 1990 had been extremely successful, and already those markets accounted for some 30 per cent of overseas sales. The UK had been difficult, although Jeyes had increased revenue by 8 per cent. The acquisition of Crowner, the industrial cleaning product manufacturer, in February for Â£2m was responsible for just under half the rise in group turnover to Â£30.8m (Â£26.5m). The purchase also accounted for a rise in debt to Â£6m and in interest charges to Â£528,000 (Â£314,000). Investment income rose from Â£26,0000 to Â£109,000. Gearing was 43 per cent, although Mr Moir said this would come down to about 20 per cent at the year-end. Gear- ing was usually higher at the interim stage due to a seasonal rise in working capital, he said. Operating margins rose from 6.7 per cent to 7.1 per cent through a cost-cutting pro- gramme and new product launches. Earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 8.3p (6.9p) and the interim dividend goes up by 0.4p to 2.6p.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Graham Deller Golden Vale, the County Cork-based dairy products manufacturer, yesterday reported a 37 per cent expan- sion in profits for the first half of 1991. The pre-tax increase - from I25.32m to I17.31m (Â£6.7m) - was struck after net interest charges ahead to I11.27m (1307,000) and came on turn- over up 40 per cent to I11155.8m (I2111.6m). Last September the group purchased the dairy interests of Food Industries, Mr Larry Goodman's former agribusi- ness. Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, said that that acqui- sition and the purchase in December of Bridgend Cream- eries had \"significantly enhanced the earnings profile of the group\". An interim dividend of 0.42p, up from 0.36p, is pay- able from earnings of 4.18p (3.17p) per share."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "CI GROUP, Wolverhampton- based steel supplier and engi- neer, reported taxable profits of Â£1.69m for the six months to July 31, less than half the com- parable Â£3.75m. Turnover fell 19 per cent from Â£48.6m to Â£39.4m. Mr Albert Hargreaves, chair- man, said the results high- lighted the depth and severity of the recession but reflected few of the benefits now accru- ing from the cost cutting pro- gramme. In the steel division turnover and margins were lower. Coupe Foundry, which relies on the capital goods sector, continued to experience severe difficulties and was sold to its management in July. Engineering division compa- nies involved in capital equip- ment had a difficult time but there was a sound performance from the flooring companies. There was an extraordinary charge this time of Â£433,000 being provisions against expec- ted trading losses from compa- nies affected by CI's further changes. As part of these Mr Har- greaves is giving up as execu- tive chairman, but remaining as a non-executive director. Mr Patrick McTighe, chief execu- tive of Davy Corporation is to become non-executive chair- man. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.825p from lower earnings per share of 1.34p (2.87p). River & Mercantile American assets rise River & Mercantile American Capital and Income Trust reported net assets of 38.57p per capital share and 63.08p per income share at August 31. The figures compared with 30p and 51.59p respectively at the same stage of 1990. The trust saw net revenue for the six months to end-Au- gust fall to Â£253,000 (Â£327,000) for earnings of 3.37p (4.36p) per income share. A second interim dividend of 1.8p makes 3.6p so far this year. Last year's total amounted to 7.8p. Brixton Estate ahead to Â£11.7m In spite of the recession in the property sector, Brixton Estate increased both pre-tax profit and rental income for the half year to June 30. Net rental income rose 17 per cent from Â£19.6m to Â£22.9m, while pre-tax profits also rose 17 per cent, from Â£10m to Â£11.7m. Interest charges increased from Â£8.4m to Â£9.9m. Earnings per share improved from 4.45p to 5.2p; the interim dividend is lifted from 2.55p to 2.9p. Pacific Assets net assets jump 39% Pacific Assets Trust's net asset value per share at July 31 was 259.1p basic, an improvement of 39 per cent over the six month period but slightly lower than the 262.7p at the same time last year. Net revenue for the six months to end-July was Â£237,000 (Â£154,000). Earnings increased from 0.8p to 1.23p per share. The company said that mar- kets had been strong during the six month period following the resolution of the Gulf cri- sis. Pacific Assets had recently received approval from the Tai- wanese authorities to invest directly in the Taiwanese stock market for the first time. Contract delays and bad debts hit SWP The current woes of the con- struction industry were illus- trated again yesterday by SWP Group, the timber component and architectural metalwork company. The USM-quoted company reported profits of Â£826,000 for the 12 months to June 30, a decline of 35 per cent on the previous Â£1.26m. Turnover was static at E10.3m. Mr Robert Stickings, chair- man, blamed the \"disappoint- ing\" outcome on increased bad debts, contract delays and \"an unexpected contraction in workload\". \"There has been little sign of the long promised recovery from recession\" he said. The group was unlikely to see any recovery until the second half of the current year. Earnings per share emerged at 2.2p, down from 3.1p, but the single dividend for the year is maintained at 0.6p. Assets dip at K'wort Development Fund The net asset value of Klein- wort Development Fund declined by 6.4 per cent, from 360.9p to 337.93p per share over the 12 months to July 31. Net revenue of this invest- ment trust, managed by Klein- wort Benson Development Cap- ital, rose to Â£718,762 (Â£652,851) for earnings of 11.88p (10.79p) per share. A recommended final dividend of 6.75p brings the total for the year to 9.5p (8.6p).",

   "text_content" : "By Mlehlyo lakl amoto WATMOUGHS, the printing group, saw its pre-tax profits almost halved, from Â£5.08m to Â£2.8m, in the half-year to June SO as it felt the effects of the UK media and printing down- turn. The fall came on turnover only slightly lower at Â£48.6m (148.9m). Earnings per share fell from 14.22p to 6.39p. The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 2.5p. Competitive trading condi- tions intensified in the second quarter when the group expe- rienced order cancellations and reductions, particularly in mail order and sales promo- tion brochures. It also temporarily lost part of its contract to print The Times Saturday Review, which resulted in a loss of revenue amounting to some Â£500,000. However, that contract has now been resumed and the group expects to see a \"conisid- erable improvement\" in sales and profits in the second half. \"We believe strongly this is a blip and not a long-term trend,\" said Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive. The group has a number of new contracts, including holi- day brochures for Horizon and supplements to the Mail On Sunday's YOU magazine. Reval, the Hungarian sub- sidiary acquired in February, has won the contract to print a Hungarian TV magazine fol- lowing the contract to print the Hungarian state airline in-flight magazine. Cash flow continues to be resilient, and gearing was expected to be stable at about 30 per cent on borrowings of Â£18m at the year end. Net assets stand at Â£66m. Interest charges of Â£1.32m (Â£1.29m) are covered nearly three times by operating prof- its of Â£3.73m (Â£6.37m). Capital investment has continued with the group expecting to spend about Â£14m in the year. Watmoughs is also merging its two financial printing com- panies into one division in order to increase its share of the market for annual reports and other financial documents.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper UNITED FRIENDLY Group, the life and general insurer which obtained a full stock market listing in July, reported an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Â£7.76m. Higher losses on general business in the half year to June 30 were offset by life profit transfers and other income. Investment income and real- ised capital gains rose to Â£7.9m (Â£6.2m). Life profits increased to Â£4.07m (Â£4m). Underwriting losses from general business rose 31 per cent to Â£4.21m (Â£3.21m). A heavier tax burden of 21.98m, against Â£891,000, reduced post-tax profits to Â£5.78m (Â£6.09m). The interim dividend goes up by 20 per cent to 4.2p (3.5p), payable from earnings per share of 7.22p (7.63p). Extraordinary costs arising from the scheme to establish United Friendly Group, the new non-insurance holding company created at the time of the full listing, amounted to Â£743,000. New life premiums were slightly higher at Â£10.4m (Â£10.3m), reflecting a strong performance by the industrial branch - weekly cash sales made on a door-to-door basis - with premiums rising by more than 27 per cent to Â£4.39m (Â£3.45m). In contrast, both new annual premiums and new annual pension premiums in the ordi- nary branch declined, by 6 per cent to Â£3.4m and 20 per cent to Â£2.61m respectively. Overall life premiums rose to Â£86m (Â£83.8m). The industrial branch now accounts for just under 50 per cent of the total life premium income compared with 80 per cent in the mid- 1980s. The group pressed ahead with its recent push into gen- eral insurance. Premium income rose to Â£35.7m com- pared with Â£30.2m. Claims also rose sharply as a result of increased theft and, to a lesser extent, subsidence. The underwriting loss increased to Â£4.21m (Â£3.2m).",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Cane BASS, the German chemicals group, is taking full control of Comparex, the computer mar- keting company it formed nearly five years ago with Sie- mens, the German electronics giant. It will acquire Siemens' 33.5 per cent stake for an undis- closed sum, and the deal is expected to be completed by the end of the month. BASS and Siemens formed Comparex in 1987 as a Euro- pean computer manufacturing and marketing operation, prin- cipally to supply mainframe computers made by Hitachi of Japan. In contrast to the majority of European-owned computer manufacturers, Com- parex has consistently reported good revenues and profits. It has made a speciality of com- puter rental. Comparex said yesterday that sales for the first half of 1991 rose 3 per cent to DM522m ($300m) compared with the same period last year. It does not disclose six-month profit figures, but said business was \"satisfactory in view of the dif- ficult overall situation in the high-performance computer equipment market\". Overall sales of mainframe computers have slowed in the past few years as the market has matured and customers have looked for cheaper solu- tions to data processing prob- lems. Comparex said the contribu- tion made by mainframe systems to its sales dropped by 32 per cent in the first half of 1991, while revenues from com- puting services rose. It warned that earnings in 1991 would be worse than 1990 due to the rise in the value of the dollar. As a result of the unusually severe slide in prices, the earnings forecasts have had to be corrected. The sale of the Comparex stake is seen as a further step in the rationalisation of the European computer industry. It also helps to resolve a situa- tion peculiar to companies marketing Japanese systems in Europe. Siemens markets large com- puters using technology sourced from Fujitsu of Japan. It is also struggling to absorb Nixdorf, the loss-making Ger- man minicomputer manufac- turer. Siemens Nixdorf, the joint company formed as a result of the merger, continues to make losses. Hitachi sells its mainframe computers in Europe through Comparex and its own subsid- iary, Hitachi Data Systems.",

   "text_content" : "By Willllim Dawknh in Paris RENAULT, the French stateowned car maker, and Volvo of Sweden yesterday took their co-operation a significant step further by exchbning senior staff in their French als divisions.' The move will be followed by further exchanges of executives and the estab- lishment of a working group to study other ways in which the partners' sales deartments could co-operate, said Mr Lo c Caperan, Renault's commercial director for France. This co-operation, the latest conse- quence of last year's share swap between the two car-makers, relates to sales of cars and light commercial vehicles, but excludes the partners' truck businesses. The exchange puts Mr Caperan on the board of Volvo Automobiles France and moves Mr Vincent de Laurens from director-general of sales networks for Volvo Automobiles France to become director-general of Renault Luxem- bourg. Mr de Laurens is to be replaced at Volvo by Mr Jean Lasserre, formerly Renault's south west regional director. Since the agreement, the two car- makers have set up a 50 per cent joint- ly-owned research subsidiary in France, launched in April 1990. They have com- bined some of their procurement activi- ties and exchanged \"several dozen\" executives in allepartments. Meanwhile, Renault has agreed to supply Volvo with diesel engines, and the Swedish partner is to supply Ren- ault with petrol engines of a type yet to be specified, said Renault. The French company is also expected to provide engines and gearboxes for Volvo's pro- duction at a Dutch plant jointly oper- ated with Mitsubishi of Japan. Under last year's share exchange, Volvo has taken a 20 per cent stake in the French group - to rise to 25 per cent in 1994 - and Renault has a 25 per cent stake in Volvo's car operations. Renault also took 5.5 per cent of AB Volvo, the Swedish group's parent com- pany, while the pair took 45 per cent stakes in each others' truck divisions. The aim of the latest step in their co-operation is to \"develop synergies\" between their respective French sales forces, ahead of the arrival in France of the new Volvo 850, said Renault. \"The identity of each of the marques, in par ticular the integrity of their pruct ranes and the separation of dealer net- works will be respected,\" it added. Volvo sells between 12,000 and 15,000 cars in France annually, a small frac- tion of last year's 2.3m registrations.",

   "text_content" : "R Borger A. Lenth, the new president of Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, has set his sights on pulling the bank back into profits by 1993. He has taken over after four of the most traumatic years in the bank's 143-year history, which culminated last month in the implementation of a gov- ernment NKr2.1bn ($320m) res- cue plan. Amid the crisis, Mr Sverre Walter Rostoft, chief executive, quit, while Mr Per Ditlev Simonsen, the board chairman, accused the former manage- ment of witholding informa- tion on credit losses over the past two years. Mr Simonsen's remarks prompted the Oslo bourse to intitiate an investigation into the bank's financial affairs which determined that Christi- ania had failed to report losses accurately, despite advice from internal accounts auditors. Christiania plunged to net losses of NKrl.6bn in the first half of this year against profits of NKrl28m a year earlier, and credit losses after six months had more than doubled to NKrl.898bn from NKr838m. But Mr Lenth is not daunted by such events. Indeed, he sees them as the end of a purging process that will enable him to set the bank on track, restore the morale of staff and renew Christiania's image. During the year Mr Lenth's predecessor had at the helm he implemented a sweeping reor- ganisation of the bank into three separate units with the aim of creating a big Nordic nmp A- T. uth! nrinriti.a will hi. tn ount imts financial conglomerate. Mr Lenth will dismantle this structure by merging the three into one bank. \"In the end this strategy of splitting the bank didn't suc- ceed because of (Christiania's) weak financial situation and it became clear that investments to achieve this could not be supported by profits.\" Restoring Christiania's financial health can only be achieved by setting more modest targets for growth and by returning the bank to \"old traditions of decent bank- ing practices,\" believes Mr Lenth. \"What I shall seek to achieve will be in sharp contrast to the kind of 'transaction economy' which dominated Christiania in the recent past,\" he said. Mr Lenth's priorities will be to cut costs so they are more line with the business the bank can realistically expect to gen- erate. One condition for the cash injection is that the bank cut costs by up to NKr500m, or 15 per cent, annually. \"Christiania will have to become internationally com- petitive in Norway. Not in the sense of being Vikings who are out to conquer the world . . . that's not the point. But it is very much the point of not maintaining costs and overheads which will, in par- ticular, make us uncompetitive in Norway,\" he said. Christiania, he believes, was slow in entering international banking but then grossly exceeded its capabilities. Apart from serving the inter ests of 4.2m Norwegians, he feels that Christiania has to return to its core business of providing financial and bank- ing services to domestic clients seeking to establish outside Norway. Burgeoning commercial and private bankruptcies have taken their toll on Norway's banks, while real estate values have plunged by as much as 40 per cent, by some estimates, in the last four years. Christiania is a comparatively large prop- erty holder. Part of Christiania's troubles arose out of what Mr Lenth describes as a gap between maintaining a high-flying image and the realities of its operating environment. He does not agree with the bank's critics that previous management consciously set out to deceive authorities. \"I personally feel they managed to detached themselves from reality,\" Mr Lenth said. Mr Leth believes that the government could do more to prop up the country's banking system. In particular it could dismantle subsidies given to the postal banking system. \"At the moment there is a discrepancy between the ser- vices we provide and what our clients our willing to pay for. In my opinion we have an over-banked society,\" Mr Lenth said. \"And, unfortunately, a lot of jobs within the banking industry will have to go. A period in Norwegian banking has come to an end.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Karen Fossil in Oslo STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, is pushing ahead with plans for the construction of a NKr2.5bn ($380m) chemical production plant. The plant will be the first step in a three-stage strategy aimed at propelling the com- pany to the top of the world league of production of MTBE, which Is made by reacting methanol with isobutylene and is used as an additive to improve the octane level of unleaded petrol. The plant will be built on the west coast of Norway with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes annually. A second plant is aimed to be built at Antwerp where Statoil has a polypropyl- ene plant which is 50-50 owned with US-based Himont. Construction of a third, smaller, MTBE plant is being planned at a Norwegian west coast site where Statoil has Europe's most modern refi- nery. Output would be less than half of that planned for the other two facilities. Production would be sold in world markets and also be used at Statoil's two crude oil refineries at Mongstad, in Nor- way, and Kallenborg, in Swe- den. The company believes that the future demand for high-octane and unleaded fuel will expand as environmental concern pushes countries towards tougher emissions control legislation. The company's plans will have to be approved by Norwe- gian authorities who recently signalled a change in heart over Statoil's plans to build a NKr2.3bn methanol plant.",

He said there was always a possi- bility of some future venture or outside investment but added: \"We're much\" less ,aggressive than a year ago.

Federated made a larger loss at the after-tax level, up from $80m in the second quarter of 1990 to $108.5m in the same period of 1991. However, this was largely due to higher reor- ganisation expenses of $101.8m, against $4.1m, and, at the oper- ating level, Federated actually produced a $10.6m profit com- pared with a $28m loss. Turn- over was $964.7m. Allied, meanwhile, made an after-tax loss of $35.3m, com- pared with last time's deficit of $46.3m. Again, at the operating level, there was an improved performance, although the group remained in the red. The second-quarter operat- ing loss was reduced from $12.1m to $2.1m. Sales were $529.8m.

McNeil's aggressive expan- sion into a national operation, specialising in retail business, underwritings and options trading, slowed with the 1987 stock market crash. It has been recovering slowly from a heavy loss in fiscal 1990. The company is controlled by its senior management group, headed by Mr Andre Desaulniers, with public partic- ipation. He and the other direc- tors recommend the bid. RBC is 75 per cent owned by the Royal Bank of Canada. In the year to September 30 it earned C$22m on revenues of C$559m and closed its UK sub- sidiary. This year, it is show- ing signs of progress and the deal will increase its share of the domestic retail market.",

Fares on some routes have fallen by up to 70 per cent over the year, although most cheap fares are aimed at the relatively small off-peak lei- sure market rather than busi- ness class or regular economy class passengers. Mr Bryan Grey, chief execu- tive of Compass Airlines, the smallest of the three, said fares were likely to rise from October. He said the airlines were operating on \"very thin shoe, strings\" as a result of the fares war, which was triggered by deregulation and the onset of a domestic recession. \"Our competitors must be bleeding very badly, and we are not doing so well our- selves,\" Mr Grey told a confer- ence organised by the Bureau of Industry Economics. Australian Airlines, the gov- ernment-owned airline which is to be privatised later this year, said it would make no decision on fares until its Pay- As-Yon-Fly deal, which offers discounts of up to 60 per cent, expires next month.",

The essence of the deal is that Anglo, Gencor and their subsidiaries will pay R1.07bn ($379m) to buy the ferrochrome and stainless steel producer MS&A from Barlow Rand. MS&A's stainless steel inter- ests are valued at R500m and the ferrochrome interests at R575m. The stainless steel Interests, which will be integrated into the Columbus project, are being jointly funded by High- veld Steel and Samancor, while the ferro-alloy operations will be put into Samancor which will fund half the purchase. The balance will come from Anglo and its associate, De Beers, whose total interest in Samancor rises to 28 per cent. The catalyst for the deal was Barlow's announcement in May that it planned to reduce its stake in the wholly-owned MS&A. This was to reduce the buffeting of its results by the volatility of MS&A. It was, as Mr Warren Clew- low, executive chairman of Barlow, has 'often remarked, an unacceptable case of the com- modity tall wagging the inds trial dog. Barlow's original intention was not to sell NMSo . but to float it and, over time, to reduce its stake to as low as 30 per cent. This changed with the offer from Anglo Anerican and Gencor. Oine reason was financial - analysts agree that Barlow would not have received such a good price had it not been for the springboard potential which MS&A offered the Col- umbus partners. The other was strategic. Mr Clewlow says his philosophy is that \"you have got to lead in your industries\". Post-Columbus, MS&A would have been a small player in the stainless steel field. \"It was going to be difficult for us to develop in the shadow of Col- umbus.\" The effect of the deal for Bar- low is that debt at the centre of the group is cleared, the com- pany is left with about RS00m cash - thus removing the need for a rights issue - and a loss-maker has been removed which will bump up earnings in the short term and make them steadier in the longer term. Mr Richard Stuart, an indus- trial analyst at stockbrokers Martin, says the deal helps refocus Barlow on what it is good at - managing mature manufacturing and trading businesses. The cash available will also allow it some flexibil- ity to capitalise upon future opportunities. Mr Clewlow argues: \"As a country we are poised. This is the time to -15 & A Oprag prilt (Rand 000's) 200 200 100 0 196586 87 88 89 90 91 make sure you are ready for those opportunities.\" Samancor, the world's lead- ing ferro-alloys producer, is no less a beneficiary of the deal. First, it gains access to very large chrome reserves in the form of the Henry Gould and Winterveld mines. Second, its market dominance is consoli- dated - it will control about 39.3 per cent of the world's cost effective ferrochrome capacity after the deal. Third, it should gain from a probable recovery in the world ferrochrome price. F ierce competition between South African ferrochrome producers over the past 18 months has driven the world price down to *a level of 48 US cents/lb, com- pared with an average of 76.3 cents in 1989. Now MS&A, tra- ditionally regarded as the mav- erick producer, is removed from the equation. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Samancor's chair- man, says they will also be rationalising existing produc- tion. Finally, Samancor's pros- pects are also considerabll enhancod by having the firn backing of the country's tw largest mining houses, then having previously been ba( blood between Anglo and Gen cor over Samancot. The other, crucial, angle to the deal is its impact on the prospects for the Columbui project. At full production o about 400,000 tonnes a year combined with MS&A's exist ing capacity of about 120,00 tonnes, it will make Soutl Aftica the world's fifth larges stainless steel producer. The subject of endless dis cussion over the past twi years, it faced obstacles in thi form of lack of access to foz eign markets, because of sanc tions, and the problem o South Africa's high cost of cap ital and high tax rate makini returns too low. The sanction issue has now receded whili the financial angle wai addressed earlier this mont] with the government announc ing tax-incentives for expor oriented, mineral processini projects. Coming on top of this, thi technical, production and mar keting synergies offered by thi acquisition of MS&A's existinj stainless steel plant make thi project much more attractive. This plant will now form thi basis for the Columbus project By lowering up-front costs b! as much as Ribn, comparem with an initial estimate o R3.lbn, the risks of the projec are diminished considerably Columbus will also benefi from the pooling of expertisi between MS&A and Anglo who in Mr Graham Boustrec and Mr Leslie Boyd offer thi most experienced steel anm alloy executives in the country",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown FAI Insurances, the Australian insurance and investment group, yesterday blamed \"extremely difficult\" trading conditions for a net operating loss of A$144m (US$115.2m) for the year to the end of June, compared with a profit of AS18m last year. Mr Rodney Adler, chief exec- utive, said the main reasons for the loss were an underwrit- ing deficit of A$191m and prop- erty writedowns of more than A$100m caused b*y the deterior- ating property market in Aus- tralia and overseas. Mr Adler said the group had taken \"severe measures\" to stem the underwriting losses and reduce its exposure to the property market. However, the group warned that underwrit- ing losses would continue. \"We expect a significant improvement in our underwrit- ing performance, although we are still budgeting for an underwriting loss. In this regard, the insurance results for July and August are in line with our budgetary expecta- tions,\" Mr Adler said. FAI said the underwriting loss had been caused by an increase in fraud-related claims, higher reinsurance costs and the continuing impact of natural disasters. The group said it had also been hurt by aggressive price- cutting intended to maintain market share. The board announced some time ago that price-cutting would cease. Mr Adler said the group had carried out a review and re-rat- ing of all classes of insurance business on the basis of tougher underwriting criteria. Premium income fell from A$635m to A$623m, but the group said its expense ratio was still one of the lowest in the Australian insurance industry. The directors said provisions for outstanding claims had been increased to AS890m, in addition to unexpired risk pro- visions of AS246m, increasing total provisions from A$S3m last year to a record A$1.136bn. The board said there would be no final dividend to follow the 4 cent dividend announced after the first six months. The total dividend of 4 cents com- pares with 9 cents last year."

   "article_dc_title" : "Bank of England Restrains New Gilt Issue to Â£1.5bn",
   "text_content" : "By Tracv Corrian in London and Karn Zmaor in New York PRICES in the UK gilts market were steady yesterday as deal- ers awaited details of the-UK government's new issue on September 25. The announce- ment that the new supply would consist of Â£1.5bn of the 9% per cent issue due 2004 was well received. \"The Bank of England is being very conservative,\" one dealer said, as the issue was both shorter-dated and smaller in size than many traders had expected. There had been spec- ulation that it would be in the 2008/2009 area, and would total as much as Â£2bn. Consequently, dealers reported some switching into bonds maturing in 2008/2009. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 gained A, while slightly short- er-dated gilts in the area of the new supply lost a little ground. There was little interest in data showing the UK govern- ment's public spending borrow- GOVERNMENT BONDS ing requirement (PSBR) at Â£1.85bn last month, in line with expectations. s BEARISH sentiment in the Dutch government bond mar- ket improved somewhat when it emerged at yesterday's national budget that the Dutch government's funding require- ment for this year is lower than many traders had feared. The market, however, showed little reaction to the news that the government's borrowing requirement for 1991 is now projected at F146.5bn in 1991, revised from F144.9bn. Dealers said there had been some concern that the govern- ment had overspent substan- tially, and would need to raise an extra FllObn. \"The market had discounted further supply of at least one main public state loan,\" one dealer said. The government said it had already completed 93 per cent of its funding for 1991, exclu- ding any private placements. \"When traders, get back to their desks [following the bud- get], they may decide that a 35 basis point spread over 10-year German bonds is worth buy- ing,\" a dealer said. In Frank- furt, German government bond prices again ended unchanged in lacklustre trading. SUS TREASURIES firmed yes- terday afternoon after drifting lower in the morning, but trad- ing throughout the day was lacklustre in the absence of any market-moving news. The yield of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond crept back towards the 8 per cent level early, but prices picked up later. By late afternoon, the long bond was up J at 1021#, yielding 7.91 per cent. Shorter- dated maturities were unchanged to be J, higher. The Federal Reserve added liquidity to the system by arr- anging overnight system repur- chase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 5% per cent. The new perceived target for the rate is 5% per cent. There was little reaction to the industrial production data. Although industrial production for August rose only 0.3 per cent, below the expected 0.5 per cent, figures for July and June were revised upward. Industrial production rose 0.6 per cent in July, against esti- mates of 0.5 per cent, while June was 0.8 per cent higher compared with 0.6 per cent. STHE JAPANESE government bond market re-opened yester- day, after a national holiday in Japan on Monday, to a small bout of profit-taking after a two-week rally, partly for pur- poses of book-dressing at the end of the the first half of the Japanese financial year. The benchmark No 129 issue slid in Japanese trading, to 6.10 per cent, and continued to weaken in European trading, to 6.12.",

The new system, Japan Secu- rities Dealers' Assoc- iation Quotation (JASDAQ), is expected to attract more inves- tors to the OTC market, which has grown larger than the Tokyo Stock Exchange's second section in terms of market value. The value of the OTC mar- ket's shares totalled Y15,200bn in August 1991, compared with Y12,000bn for the second sec- tion. The system will increase the speed and capacity of daily trading, an official said. With the increased liquidity, stocks would be priced more appropri- ately. The association also plans to introduce the JASDAQ index as a benchmark average index of the OTC market in October 1992. All the OTC shares will be traded through computer ter- minals at securities companies directly connected to the main computer at Japan Tento (OTC) Securities. Japan Tento Securities, established in 1976, specialises in mediating OTC stock orders between securities com- panies.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Portuguese Bank Makes a Spirited Comeback",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "SPIRITO Santo, the Por- tuguese financial group, is poised to regain con- trol of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL) when the privatisation of its former business flagship is completed this year. It will represent a remark- able comeback for the Espirito Santo group, which was forced into exile in Brazil when the bulk of its Portuguese assets - BESCL, two leading insurance companies and a wide range of industrial investments - were seized in 1975. Today, the Espirito Santo group, which has stock market listings in London and Luxem- bourg, is one of Portugal's few businesses with a strong inter- national presence. Espirito Santo Financial Holding, the banking and financial arm, made net profits of $25.5m on assets of $2.37bn in 1990. Nor does this figure tell the full story, since it excludes the assets of Compan- hia de Seguros Tranquilidade, Portugal's leading pension fund and life insurance group. Together with an investor group, Espirito Santo bought 56.1 per cent of Tranquilidade (which also belonged to Espirito Santo before 1975) when it was privatised last Patrick Blum looks at the return to strength of the country's Espirito Santo group October. At September 1990, Tranquilidade had total assets of $568m. To re-acquire BESCL, Portu- gal's third biggest bank with an estimated value of about $lbn, the group has raised cap- ital through a substantial bor- rowing programme. At the end of 1990, BESCL had assets of $9.2bn. Last July, the group secured a 23 per cent stake in the bank when it was partly privatised through a flotation on the Lis- bon bourse. It wants to raise its shareholding to around 51 per cent when the state's remaining 60 per cent comes up for sale. Winning back BESCL will close a chapter in an unusual history for the Espirito Santo family. \"Brazil was the spring- board for our return to Europe,\" says Mr Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, chair- man. In 1976, the group set up the Banco Inter-Atlantico, an investment bank, in Rio de Janeiro, later acquiring a majority stake in a local insur- ance company. The first step back into Europe came in 1977, with the establishment of Compagnie Financiere Espirito Santo, a Lausanne-based fund manage- ment company. Other banking ventures in France, the US, Spain and Germany followed. The group began making fresh inroads to Portugal in 1986 when the government reopened the banking sector to private initiative, establishing Banco Internacional de Credito (BIC) - corporate and private banking - in association with Credit Agricole of France, and Espirito Santo Sociedade de Investimentos (ESSI), an investment company. Several specialised financial services companies followed and, with recent acquisitions, Portugal now accounts for about 80 per cent of the group's assets. Control of BESCL is cen- tral to the group's strat- egy. Mr Espirito Santo Salgado says a minority stake would be unsatisfactory because it would leave the bank vulnerable to interna- tional acquisition.

   "text_content" : "ily WllliiwntDwklns in Paris CREDIT Local de France, the tae.cntrolsled'bank for local authrities, yesterday revealed that its impending flotation would involve 25 per cent of the bank's equity. Mr Pierre Richard, president, aM the goivernment would sell around 20 per cent of its direct shareholding and that other investors would release another 5 per cent of the bank's equity. Cridit Local, France's lead- ing lender to local authorities, Is also the biggest borrower on the French bond market after the government. Its flotation is the first since France extended Its partial privatisation pro- gramme. A consortium of bank advis- ers are preparing a valuation of Credit Local in time for a stock market introduction at the end of November. Currently, the state holds 47.5 per cent of Credit Local' capital directly, with anothes Spercent in the hands of th se des Dp6ts, the sat&- controlled financing network of which Crddit Local used ta be a division until its transfor. mation into a normal company in W987. A mixture of foreign and domestic institutional share holders own the rest of the equity. They will also be ee to sell, but the state and the Caisse des Dep6ts will keep their combined shareholding at just above 50 per cent, said Mr Richard. Mr Richard is undeterred by the financial problems to have hit several over-indebted French towns over the past year. He pointed out that Crddit Local's experience In Iasseslin the stats '.oftenn-m- netable local autjority iacgave it an edge over -ss specalied lenders. CrdeIt rLocal ovids 45 per cent of the to the con- try's local ati ad has an AAA debt rating. It has raised FFr2Sbn so far this year on the domestic and interpa- tional markets, almost as much as in the whole of 1900, said Mr Richard. He expected Credit Local to raise more than 70 per cent - FFr2bn - of its needs on the international bond markets this year. Cr6dit Local lent FFrl9.1bn in the first eight months of this year, 15 per cent more than during the same period in 1090. Its balance sheet total was FFr243bn at the end of last year, up from FFr214.5bn.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb WHILE South Korean and Taiwanese companies are pre- paring to launch a stream of equity-linked bond issues over the next few weeks, their Japa- nese counterparts are notice- ably absent from the interna- tional markets. A host of reasons has been given for the shortage of Japa- nese equity-linked issues, including unfavourable condi- tions in the Tokyo market, a lack of investor interest in increasing their exposure to Japan, and the fact that Sep- tember is usually a quiet time for Japanese companies, given that it is the end of their sinan- cial half-year. Several London-based houses predict that Japanese compa- nies will remain loath to issue equity-linked debt while the scandals surrounding Nomura and Nikko, two of the \"Big Four\" securities firms, domi- nate the headlines. News that Nomura is sus- pected of manipulating share prices, and that both Nomura and Nikko had paid compensa- tion to investors for stock mar- ket losses and dealt with gang- sters, has led to a sharp fall in the Japanese stock market. As a result of the fall, many companies are reluctant to issue convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. \"Many Japanese companies think their share price is too low to sell equity-linked issues right now,\" said one equity syndicate manager, adding: \"Japanese companies tend to feel a degree of responsibility to their investor base - unlike companies in certain other markets - so they tend to do INTERNATIONAL EQUITY ISSUES equity-linked issues when they think their share price will go up.\" Furthermore, it has become more expensive for Japanese companies to swap the dollar proceeds of their issues back into yen now, partly because coupon levels have risen in the last few years. It seems likely that large Japanese companies which do not actually need to raise money now will wait until market conditions are more favourable. * Warnaco Group, the US underwear and menswear man- ufacturer, is expected to raise about $100m in an initial pub- lic offering. The company, which has won approval for a New York Stock Exchange listing, is sell- ing 5.75m shares, of which 1.15m are aimed at interna- tional investors. The indicated price is between $16 and $18 per share. Morgan Stanley is lead manager for the issue. *Thai Farmers Bank, one of the larger banks in Thailand, is raising about $120m of new capital. It is Issu- ing 10m shares, of which 2.5m will be sold internationally mainly to Far Eastern funds based in London and Hong Kong. * SCUDDER Stevens & Clark has launched the Scudder Global Small Company Fund, Renter reports from New York. The fund does not carry sales charges, redemption fees or marketing fees. The mini- mum investment is $1,000, and $500 for Individual Retirement Accounts.",

In a position paper made public yesterday the central bank generally endorsed the draft It Usa it created a mod- ern and liberal framework for securities trading broadly compatible with the directives and regulations of the Euro- pean Cammunity. ft approved the transfer of snpervisory authority over the bourses from the cantonal govern- ments to the Federal Banking Commission The SNB proposed, however, that takeover procedures be dealt with in a separate law. Moreover, while the Finance Ministry's draft could oblige a buyer to declare his interest in a company once he owned 5 per cent of the share capital, the SNB would set a 10 per cent threshold. In seeking separate legisla- tion for takeovers, the central bank supports the position of Mr Robert Studer, president of Union Bank of Switzerland. Rules for takeovers have become a controversial issue, and bankers fear a decision by the Finance Ministry to cover takeover regulations in a stock exchange bill could delay its passage through parliament. Separately, the SNB oldected that the Finance Ministry had defined illegal manipulation of share prices too broadly. The definition should be limited to instances where false informa- tion is supplied with the delib- erate intent of influencing prices. Under a programme agreed last year, the number of Swiss bourses is being reduced from seven to three - Zurich, Geneva and Basle - while planning is already well advanced for a switch to a sin- gle electronic stock exchange. With reservations, the three bourses have welcomed the draft legislation.",

The Canadian INTURNATIONAL government 30-year bond was yesterday yielding 176 basis points more than the US gov- ernment long bond. Province of British Columbia made a rare visit to the inter- national market, launching a C$500m seven-year deal. The issue, lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, carries a 1C per cent coupon, and was priced to yield 45 basis points more than Canadian govern- ment bonds. The bonds were priced roughly in line with seven-year bonds issued by the Province of Ontario, although British Columbia carries a stronger AA1 credit rating and is a less frequent borrower. Launched early in the day, the deal attracted buying from the Far East as well as conti- nental European demand. The bonds traded at around the fixed re-offer price of 99.70. Hydro Quebec launched a Sl.lbn 30-year global bond issue, following a similar deal from Ontario Hydro last week. The bonds will be priced to yield 82 basis points more than Canadian -govermment long bonds, gindt 57 basis points available on the Ontario paper in the secondary market. bThe Hdro Quebec deal will be rcd hisafterinoon, and is Joint leadmanedby Merrill Lynch: Scotiake'od, Leveaque LBeaubn and Yamaichi. Finland came with a tightly- prid Ecu5oom 10-year deal, eaan J.P. Morgan Securities. The bonds carry a coupon of 8% per cent and were priced to yield around 4.5 basis points more than French government Ecu bonds, a benchmark of the sector. The rally in the Ecu market has been such in the past month that the bonds Issued yesterday yield just 23 basis points more than D-Mark bonds by the same issuer. The pricing was seen as tight but fair by participants in the deal. However, syndicate man- gers mid the deal suffered rom the more subdued tone in the secondary market this weak and rumours of further large issues from sovereign and supranational issuers - notably Spain, Belgium and th European Bank for Recon- strction and Development. From a fixed re-offer price of .26, the bonds traded down to 99 bid by late afternoon, against fees of 0.326 per cent. Also in the Ecu sector, Japan Highway, the government- backed road financing agency, came with a Ecul4Om seven- year deal, lead-managed by nk of Tokyo Capital Mar. kets. The paper offers a coupon of 8% per cent and was priced to yield 8.95 per cent. The bonds traded at around the fixed re-offer price of 99.60. CVRD, the Brazilian iron ore producer in which the Brazil- ian government has a control- ling interest, added its name to the list of Latin American bor- rowers to tap the international bond market. The company launched a $200m three-year deal lead-managed by Citicorp Investment Bank. It pays a semi-annual coupon of 10 per cent and was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 96.404. At this level, the yield spread over US government bonds is per cent. Participants in the deal reported broad interest inthe. paper from European and US accounts. A tranche of the issue will be placed in the US by the lead manager under rule 144a. * Bankers were yesterday pre- paring for the official launch of South Africa's first public Eurobond offering since 1965, possibly as soon as today. Deutsche Bank, which is lead- managing the deal, declined to comment on the timing of the deal. NEW INTERNATIONAL BOND ISSUES Borrower Amount m.

   "text_content" : "By John Barham in Buenos Aires A GROUP of local and international banks has agreed to advance the government $300m out of the $800m it expects to raise from the sale of 30 per cent of Argentina's two privatised telephone com- panies. Morgan Stanley and its Argentine partner Banco Roberts, together with Banco de Galicia of Spain, Banco Tornquist, an affiliate of Credit Lyonnais, and locally-owned Banco Rio de la Plata, are to advance the funds to Argen- tina's Treasury at an annual interest rate of 11 per cent. They are acting as underwrit- ers to the sale. Mr Martin Vedrado, presi- dent of the National Securities Commission, said the advance would go to the insolvent social security fund, which is to be restructured and priva- tised by the end of this year. The government's 30 per cent holding in the two tele- phone companies is to be floated on the local and inter- national capital markets in November, a year after they were created through the pri- vatisation of ENTel, the state- owned telephone network.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters PRUDENTIAL Insurance Company of America yesterday gave further evidence of its interest in lending long-term to UK companies with news of a $100m deal for Scapa Group. The US's largest insurer has already proved an active long-term lender this year in transactions involving Williams Holdings and Simon Engineering, two other UK companies which are seeking to develop their US operations. Scapa, a manufacturer of specialist products for the paper and printing industries, was itself involved in a US acquisition last month. The latest private placement involving the Prudential, arranged by Lazard Brothers, the UK arm of the investment banking group, enables Scapa to refinance a variety of short- and medium-term dollar debt and some of it bank finance, as well as to raise new money. The fixed rate of 9.47 per cent equates to a spread of roughly 1.5 per cent over the US long bond. The 15-year deal has an average life of just over 11 years.",

   "text_content" : "BytChriiu a Lamb in Rio de Janeiro GOLD 'output from Brazilian mining companies this iiear is expected to exceed production frol e , or illegal mierfs, frQe first time. According tioMr Elmer Prata Salamao, director of the national mining department (DNPM), of a projected output of 60 tonnes, only 25 tonnes will come from garimpeiros. The figures signal an end to the.era of mass production by the garimpeiros, which took off in the 1970s. By 1981, of a total national output of 42 tonnes, 37.6 tonnes came from the gar- impeiros. Although there are an estimated 800,000 garimpei- ros still operating, their pro- duction has been reclni rap idly since the peak year 1988 when they produced 90 tonnes. In response to international pressure over environmental concerns, the povernmeut of President Fernando Collor which took office In Ma1cb n has been dynamitig s-s used by tihe gipdmpel ian attempt to force them ut ofr Indian territory But Mr -8l amao Mid the real essam'for the dramatic tnround is the simple exhaustio of stocks: \"Most garimpo deposits are superficial and have had 10 or even 20 years at extensive min ing by primitive methods and are running out\" He cites as an example the world famous Serra Pelada mine, which in the mid 1905 was overrun by hundreds of thousands of garimpos. Now the easily mined gold has gone and the mine he says is \"para- lysed and nothing but an 80m deep hole full of water\". According to' Mr Salamao, armpeiros are \"organising ito lith mte cooperatlves and uimpi who fieht uIth.Ir at ta in cortroomns rather than iith physical violence\". Gold smnuggling historicaily accounted for 00 per cent dof total output but an arbiragng opetion egun last year by Into the formal economyhas had impressive results. Last year only five tonnes of the total output of 90 tonnes were not registered, compared to 50.5 o 80 tonnes the previous year. According to Mr Sala- mao, Brazil can absorb 40 tonnes per year as a financial asset while the rest is exported by the central bank to main- tain a stable exchange rate. Despite the success in count- eringr arimpos and smuggling, Mr Salamao said Brazil's con- tinning economic crisis and poor investmset climate p's- for the rest of the $1.4bn was ineted in gold production and exploration over the last ten ears but the tendency is for ti to falL Pro- duction from mining compa- nles is expected to reach 44.5 tonnes in 1998 and, in the wort scenario, stabilise at this level, compared to the most optimistic scenario of ending the decade with a total produc- tion of 120 tonnes. Mr Salamao said the latter scenario depends on very heavy investment. This might be forthcmfin Nl a poooed constitutional amendment is passed to end the current restriction under which foreign companies can put up only 49 per cent of total risk capital.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent FIVE copper mines in the former Soviet Union's Ural mountains are almost certain to be closed down soon because they are not economically via- ble, suggests the Metals & Min- erals Research Services consul- tancy group. This means that concen- trates from the mines - mate- rial with an average of 20 per cent copper - will not be exported to the West. MMRS says the mines - the Uchaly, Sibay, Gay, Busibay and the biggest, the Karabash underground mine - once sup- plied the \"highly environmen- tally questionable Karabash smelter.\" In its latest Base Metal Con- centrates report, MMRS says that some low grade copper concentrates from mines in Armenia were exported to the West last year and some was bought by Japanese smelters. The Armenian mines previ- ously supplied the Alaverdi smelter which was closed by the authorities in September last year. Alaverdi, says MMRS, produced about 80,000 tonnes a year of copper but was a big polluter. \"In 1988 its exit gases con- tained about 160,000 tonnes of emissions of which about 40,000 tonnes was sulphur diox- ide. By mid-1989 the plant was exceeding permitted emission levels by 200 per cent at times. It was also emitting arsenic (meaning that concentrate feedstocks were arsenical also). This arsenic was dispersed into the atmosphere and was in sur- face water run-off into the River Debet.\" Base Metal Concentrates.

London dealers said the market was following New York with some reluctance but was unable to maintain levels while US prices continued to tumble.

But the market remained sceptical about a 10 per cent producer retention plan which will be presented formally at next week's ICO meeting in London.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney DEMAND for Australian mineral products will increase next year, leading to higher growth in production over the medium term, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (Abare) said yesterday. Mr Michael Kirby, Abare's chief commodity analyst, told a mining conference in Sydney that the value of non-fuel min- eral exports would rise by an average of just over 2.5 per cent a year in real terms over the next five years. However, Mr Kirby said the forecast rate of increase was well below the seven per cent rises of the late 1980s. Mr Kirby said the Abare minerals commodity index would fall by seven per cent in special drawing rights (SDR) terms this year, following a fall of 13 per cent in 1990-91. The Impact on Australian industry wm be around one per cent in Australian dollar terms, how- ever, partly because of an increase in export volumes. Abare's forecasts confirm earlier indications that gold production peaked last year at 238 tonnes, up from 18 tonnes ten years ago. Production is expected to fall to less than 225 tonnes this year, reflecting lower world prices, mine clo- sures and the impact of taxa- tion on marginal operations. Gold exports, which often lag behind production figures, are forecast to peak this year at 265 tonnes, valued at more than A$4bn (Â£1.8bn). Mr Kirby said gold produc- tion was unlikely to fall to very low levels, as forecast by some commentators and indus- try leaders. However, produc- tion was likely to slip to around 200 tonnes by 1995-96. Mr Kirby forecast aluminium production would rise slightly this year to 1,250 kilotonnes, and alumina production would be rise marginally to 11.6 megatonnes. He said export earnings from aluminium fell by nine per cent to A$9bn last year, and would fall by a fur- ther four per cent this year to just over A$1.92bn. The real value of exports of aluminium and alumina would rise by nearly three per cent a year over the five years to 1995/96 to more than A$5.5bn in current prices. Iron ore export earnings would grow from A$2.6bn last year to nearly A$3bn this year and around A$3.4bn in 1995/96, he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Leslie Crawford in Santiago Outokumpu Copper Resources of Finland is expected shortly to announce the go-ahead for its Zaldivar copper project in the Chilean Atacama desert, which will require an invest- ment of more than $300m. The company's executives in Santiago announced that a thorough exploration drive had doubled the original estimates of reserves to 120m tonnes of refined copper - enough to keep the mine productive for 20 years. The seams have an average copper content of 1.7 per cent, not as rich as its neighbour La Escondida, but more than three time the average of US and Canadian mines. Zaldivar will produce 100,000 tonnes of copper a year. In addition, Outokumpu recently cracked one of the toughest problems of mining in the driest desert in the world - finding water. \"We have tapped an aquifer about 100 km (60 miles) away near the Andes,\" says Mr Paul Premin- ger, Zaldivar's project director. Building the pipeline to ensure the mine's water supply will take up at least 10 per cent of the project's total cost. Zaldivar is the latest of a series of multi-million dollar projects which are transform- ing Chile's Atacama desert into the world's leading copper producing area. La Escondida, the $900m-mine inaugurated this year, is just a stone's throw way from Outokumpu's Zaldivar mountain. Phelps Dodge is spending $500m to develop La Candelaria, which will produce gold as well as copper. Chuquicamata, the world's biggest copper mine, lies just 100 km to the north. Zaldivar's feasibility study is expected to be ready early next year. Outokumpu has yet to decide whether it will exploit the mine as an open-cast opera- tion or by tunnelling into the mountain. Outokumpu is also studying how best to finance Zaldivar's development, which will be its biggest investment outside Fin- land. Company executives say it will probably Include a com- bination of equity, bank loans and selling production in advance to copper smelters. Part of Zaldivar's production might well be sold to a new smelter which Outokumpu is considering building in PortugaL The Finnish company says it is planning to commit $500m over the next five years in Chile. It has signed a protocol agreement with Codelco, the Chilean state copper corpora- tion, to develop new properties jointly.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Record Alumnium Stocks Cut Price by $ 15",
   "text_content" : "By David Blackwell ALUMINIUM stocks In Laondon Metal Exchange warehouses climbed yesterdayto the high- est level ever recorded for a slhg base metal, overtaking the 645800 tonnes reacheldby sco-r-stocks In early 1978. S ofk alaminm rose by a further 10,125 tonaes td stand at 658,775 tonnes. A year ago, LIM aluminium stocks were 188,025 tonmes. The relentless accumulation of alminium has. taken prices down to the lowest levels since the LME launched its contract for 99.7 per cent metal In 1987. Yesterday, three-month alu- minium closed at $1,224.50 a tonne, $15 down on the day, after falling as low a $1,222 earlier In the day's trading. Analysts yesterday said that big western producers would have to make production cuts. Mr Nick Moore, of Ord Min- nett compared the producers to Juggernaut drivers heading towards each other at full tilt. \"The results of their actions are plain to see, but both believe the right of way is theirs.\" Mr Robin Bhar, analyst with Carr Kitcat &Aitken, said a flood of aluminium from the Soviet Union was the main reason behind the surge in supplies. \"This year they are on course to export 600,000 tonnes, compared with 350,000 to 400,000 tonnes last year.\" Mr Angus MacMillan, ana- lyst with B1lliton-Enthoven Metals, said a cut in capacity of around 500,000 tonnes by western producers was now needed to bring the market fairly into balance. Apart from the Soviet imports, the market had been hit by the recession in the English speaking econo- mies and slower rates of growth in demand elsewhere. He suggested that Soviet metal of only 99 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity was being bought in the West at dis- counts of between $30 and $120 a tonne to the LME price. The metal was then melted down and \"sweetened\" with other material, he said. Producers had good reasons not to cut production. Many in the US had their power and raw material costs linked to the price of the metal, and European smelters had been protected by the strength of the US dollar. However, most analysts believe that its production is not curbed, prices could retreat further.

   "text_content" : "The ICAC expects production and consumption to rise, says John Murray Brown, back from Antalya T HE absence of China, the world's largest pro- ducer, and the inability of Soviet delegates 'to provide reliable figures, did little to dampen proceedings at the 50th annual meeting last week of the International Cotton Advisory Committee in the Turkish resort of Antalya. The 34-nation ICAC, which acts as watchdog for the $9bn cotton trade, is forecasting higher consumption and pro- duction. The resulting rise in stocks, however, is likely to hold back prices. Production is set to reach an all-time high of 92m bales in the 1991-92 season, with increases in medium and coarse categories. Extra fine production, however, is again set to fall for the fifth year running, as Sudan converts acreage to food crops, and Israel experiences irrigation shortages. Exports of extra fine and fine grades are forecast to fall 15 per cent in 1991-92. China, although not repre- sented in the ICAC, continues to dominate any calculations. The ICAC estimates China will harvest 22m bales, up from 20.7m in 1990-91. Cotton use in China is expected to rise Im bales during the next two years, accounting for half the world total. The US last week confirmed a sale of 325,000 bales to China. Chinese growers have experi- enced extensive flood damage this year. However, traders say the latest imports probably represent transport difficulties as the seaboard textile produc- ers seek to top up mill sup- plies. Indeed, the ICAC is pre- dicting lower imports by China, contributing to a 1m bale drop in world trade vol- ume in 1991 to 22.7m. World consumption mean- while is forecast at a record 89m bales in 1991 as industria- lised countries pull out of recession. August stock levels reached 29m bales, an increase of 1m bales from a year earlier. However, of that figure, an estimated 17m is owned by mills in cotton producing coun- tries, while a further 5m repre- sents producers' export com- mitments. Of the 7m bales of uncommitted stocks, the Soviet Union accounted for 2.4m. Indeed the uncertainty over Soviet production is the main factor hanging over the price. Next year's Soviet production is projected to fall over 10 per cent from the 12m bales in 1990. East European countries traditionally accounted for over half of the Soviet Union's cotton exports. However the collapse of the Comecon trad- ing system and uncertain rela- tions with the central authori- ties are forcing the cotton producing republics to look at new trading avenues. The International Institute for Cotton (IIC) may close down after a quarter of a century of promoting cotton unless it gets more support from producers, its sec- retary-general Mr Harpal Luther said yesterday, Reu- ter reports. The 1C, based in Brussels, was conceived by its mem- bers - the US, Mexico, Tan- zania, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and India - to improve cotton prod- ucts and processing, gather market information and pro- mote cotton's virtues. Mr Luther said cotton pro- ducers were neglecting the IIC because sales were good. Some cotton producers also believe the International Cotton Advisory Committee covers their needs. \"There should be a self-fin- ancing system for cotton. The money for programmes should not come from farm- ers and governments. It may be claimed from the con- sumer in such a way that it is hidden in the price of products,\" Mr Luther said. \"There's Soviet cotton com- ing out of every door, under barter deals, and at what price, no one knows,\" says Mr Ray Butler, editor of Cotton Out- look, the trade magazine. The main production region of Uzbekistan is suffering severe salinity problems, affecting crop rotations. A US agriculture official said the Soviet Union will have a fall- ing share of world production. Other producers like Sudan are set to see a fall in produc- tion as urgent food needs force the government to switch more land to food crops. Pakistan's exports are also set to fall as the country's growing textile industry absorbs more local production. Pakistan, the world's second largest exporter in 1988 with 3.8m bales, is expected to ship less than a million bales in 1992. Australia, one of the most efficient producers, is now the world's third largest exporter. However officials believe the dramatic growth of the Austra- lian industry which began in 1980 has almost run its course. Lack of new acreage means exports are set to level off at around 1.9m bales in 1992. Uganda meanwhile is seek- ing international support to revive its cotton industry, which has been returned to the private sector after years as a parastatal. Mr James Obbo of the Lint Marketing Board says both Lonrho and Ralli brothers are showing interest. Shipments from Egypt are also set to pick up as the gov- ernment adopts a more realis- tic pricing policy in line with economic reforms being admin- istered by the World Bank. In the short term, all produc- ers are waiting to see crop results from the US, the world's largest exporter. Flooding in the Mississippi Delta means some acreage has not been planted. Meanwhile, a continuing aphid problem in Texas is affecting yields. How- ever, after a late start, US pro ducers are benefiting from improved weather, according to Mr Russel Barlowe, chief cotton economist at the US agriculture department. The US is set to increase its end stocks by 400,000 tonnes. As a result officials now pre dict a decrease in acreage in 1992 in line with the 1990 US Farm Bill, which provides for a 30 per cent ratio of stocks to cotton use. News last week that the USDA was raising its September crop estimates - to 17.9m bales - knocked a fur- ther 2 US cents off the Cotlook A-index price, which ended the week at US 69 cents.",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR finished weaker on the day in Europe, but its recent decline slowed after a fall of about 2% pfennigs in the last week. Although the fall is generally expected to continue currency analysts believe that DM1.6500 is likely to prove a strong support level. Interest rate factors contin- ued to weigh on the currency. It had been assumed that last Friday's easing by the Federal Reserve would be the last in the present economic cycle, but the dollar's failure to recover reflects speculation that the Fed may be forced into another rate cut to boost eco- nomic recovery. Mr Michael Boskin, chair- man of the US president's council of economic advisers, said yesterday that \"the Fed may have to take further action if over the next span of time the money supply doesn't rebound.\" The dollar touched a low of DM1.6655 yesterday, before fin- ishing around the middle of a fairly narrow trading range. There was little reaction to a smaller than expected rise of 0.3 per cent in August US industrial production, com- pared with a revised rise of 0.6 per cent in July. Economists noted that if car assembly was stripped out pro- duction would have risen 0.5 per cent in August and also found the upward revision to the previous month encourag- ing. A rise in August capacity utilisation to 80.00 from 719.9 per cent was in line with expectations. r Wayne Angell, a gover nor of the Federal Reserve Board, said on US television that the recession has run its course and the rundown in business inventories is essen- tially over. He added that the US discount rate cut was in recognition that inflation is coming down. At the London close the dol- lar had fallen to DM1.6705 from DM1.6735; to SFrl.4585 from SFr1.4620; and to FFr5.687M from FFr5.7000, but had improved slightly to Y133.80 from Y133.55. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index was unchanged at 64.7. Sterling improved against the dollar, but maintained a soft tone in the European exchange rate mechanism despite finishing unchanged against the DMark. The Interest rate differential between London and Frankfurt has .narrowed sharply and wholesale interest rates in Lon- don are close to discounting another cut in UK bank base rates. Speculation about fur- ther rate cuts in London and doubts about the timing of a UK general election under- mined sentiment, pushing the pound down to second weakest member of the ERM. Sterling rose 30 points to $1.7425 and climbed to Y233.25 from Y232.25. It was unchanged at DM2.9100 and SS2.5425, but fell to FFr9.9100 from FFr9.9150. The pound's index finished unchanged at 91.0. The D-Mark remained third strongest ERM currency. In Paris it was fixed at a six- month high of FFr3.4075, against FFr3.4051 on Monday.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street A SHORTAGE of buyers left share prices sliding lower in thin, unconvincing trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held above the 3,000 level and closed 2.02 lower at 3,013.19 after gaining 29.52 to 3,015.21 on Monday in a late afternoon programme-driven rally. Declining issues had a very thin edge on those advan- cing, leading by 856 to 714. The slightly negative tone of the mnarket was reflected in the more representative Standard & Poor's 500, which eased 0.28 to 385.50, and in the Nasdaq composite of secondary stocks, which was 0.51 lower at 515.17. Fear of volatility ahead of this weeks \"triple witching\", when stock-index futures, stock index options and options on individual stocks will expire at the end of the week, kept many investors out of the market. Traders were unimpressed by the mornings release of industrial production statistics, which showed growth of 0.3 per cent for August, below the expected 0.5 per cent. Beazer led NYSE trading for a second day, following Han- son's Â£351.4m bid for Britain's fourth largest housebuilder. The shares held steady at $8% after surging $2% a day earlier. Among actively-traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph was up $% at $37%, Philip Morris rose $% to $72% and PepsiCo was unchanged at $29%. Meanwhile, the scandal- plagued Salomon continued to drift lower, sliding $% to $24%. Merrill Lynch, however, added 82% to $45% amid speculation that Merrill stands to gain from Salomon's suffering. Carolco dipped $% to $5% after the film company said it had reached a preliminary merger agreement with Live Entertainment. Shares in Live Entertainment eased $% to $12% Shares in Cabletron Systems dropped $2 to $45% after a sec- ondary offering of 2.5m com- mon shares was priced at $45. Quaker Oats climbed $2% to $58% on news that the com- pany will resume a 7m share repurchase programme that was first announced in 1989. In over-the-counter trading, Centocor slid $2% to $50% after an analyst at Merrill Lynch cut his rating .on the stock to hold in the wake of the stock's recent surge. Cento- cor was trading below $38 in early September, before a Food & Drug Administration advi- sory panel recommended approval of the company's drug to treat bacterial infec- tions, including septic shock. Among other drug compa- nies, Arbor Drugs rose $% to $19%. The stock has been added to Shearson's list of select growth stocks. Concern about the computer industry continued to domi- nate the secondary market. Intel, the semiconductor com- pany, extended its losses by dropping $% to $41. The issue has lost about $9 since Friday, when Intel warned that its third quarter earnings would be disappointing. Canada TORONTO prices recorded small losses in light trading. According to preliminary fig- ures, the composite index slipped 10.21 to 3,417.96, as declining issues led advances 315 to 238. Volume rose to 20.5m shares from 16.2m previously and trading value was C$215.6m against C$165.1m. Gold stocks rose 1 per cent on index and the mining group fell by a similar amount. Con- sumer products and energy were flat and financial services and industrial products were slightly lower. SOUTH AFRICA TRADING CENTRED on Barlow Rand's R1l.lbn deal with Anglo American and Gencor. Barlow rose R2.75 to R51.25. The industrial index gained 13 to 4,216, the all-gold index put on 19 to 1,127 and the all-share added 27 to 3,423.",

   "text_content" : "UGUST HAS been a month to remember over the past three years. This year it accommo- dated the unsuccessful Soviet coup; last year, the Iraqi inva- sion of Kuwait; in 1989, trading was hectic in the months lead- ing up to the Wall Street mini- crash on Friday, October 13. This year's excitements did little for embattled European stockbrokers. The Soviet fears had a spectacular but short-term effect on share prices; with Germany the worst affected of the senior bourses, markets lost up to 10 per cent on the day of the abor- tive coup, and recovered most of their losses over the next week or so. But in terms of volume, only the Netherlands and Switzerland improved on a mostly quiet July, and these by relatively little. Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, which produces the figures, says the Dutch equity market saw an exceptional rise in trading activity during and just after the Moscow coup. He notes that Amsterdam is the most international of the Euro- pean majors, with big blue chips that are easy to sell at a WUROPEAN iqnumns TuRNOvR MonthNy total in local currnoes (bn) Bowur May Jun July Aug US H1O 1961 1931 1361 $bn BelgIum 39.22 40.69 34.55 32.12 0.86 France 88.95 115.82 101.88 90.82 14.77 Gemany 120.90 142.40 110.00 106.68 58.77 Italy 13,652.00 14,744.00 8,733.60 7,712.00 5.72 Nathrlands 12.30 10.41 10.75 11.74 5.74 Spain 716.00 636.12 630.86 565.00 5.22 Swizrlb and 12.30 12.50 9.42 9.90 6.35 UK 26.36 26.70 32.13 30.55 49.50 Volume represen purchases and sal.

The Soviet crisis last month was much more short-lived than its Middle Eastern coun- terpart of 1990-91, and accord- ingly had less effect on the level of trading. Last year there was a pronounced \"spike\" in the figures, as Dutch market turnover rose from Si 12.2bn in July to F117.9bn in August, and fell back again to Si 11.2bn in September. Switzerland's gain was, in fact, merely a minor recovery. Zurich's preoccupation with domestic inflation and short-term interest rates has led to lower aggregate volume during the first eight months of this year. The halcyon days of the early and middle 1980s, when Switzerland was a byword for hard currency and low infla- tion and interest rates, are long gone. The annual inflation rate was still running at 6 per cent in August; and whatever the domestic prospects might be, events on the German political and monetary scene have led to a slow erosion of hopes that interest rates could be eased in the short term. Foreign inves- tors, whose buying led to a modest rally in Swiss equities in the spring, have been taking a neutral position. Elsewhere in Europe, the trends were all down, the most pronounced decline being in Italy, 12 per cent lower on the month and 48 per cent below the June level. Milan's latest stockbroking scandal is only part of the story. Reports of the underlying fraud did not really hit the market until the final week of the month; and the September figures are going to be affected by the delay of the August trading account settlement for two weeks from August 30. Mr Roberto Morelli of County NatWest says recent turnover figures of L5Obn to o80bn a day are symptomatic of a deeper, and longer stand- ing, malaise which has seen the renascent Italian mutual funds industry going for domestic bonds and foreign equities, to the exclusion of Italian equities. \"Turnover got as high as L00bn in 1986, when people really believed in Italian equities,\" he remem- bers, somewhat ruefully.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES gained ground Yesterday on the Tokyo mar. et's return from a long week- end. Investors were optimistic about an Imminent monetary easing, following Friday's cut in the US discount rate, writes Emiko Termaono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose for the fourth consecutive day to close at 23,443.61, up 309.18 or 1.3 per cent. The index opened at the day's low of 23,182.17 and hit the day's high of 23,559.65 at the morning close alter early arbitrage-linked buying had pushed prices up. Volume fell from Friday's 1.2bn shares to 550m, but for- eigners remained large buyers. Gains led losses by 750 to 256, with 156 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first sec- tion stocks climbed 20.87 to 1,807.71, and in London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.41 to 1,374.62. A stronger yen and lower bond yields encouraged a surge in futures prices. Foreign bro- kerages have anticipated a rally, as the recent slew of eco- nomic indicators have shown a slowdown in the economy and inflationary pressures, while worries over the supply- demand situation have eased. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said a further rally could carry the Nikkei up to 26,000 by the end of this year. Domestic institutions failed to follow the foreign buying. Traders said that, other than some life insurers taking prof- its on their holdings, most institutional investors remained quiet. Electronic issues were firm on foreign demand. Prospects of lower earnings had previ- ously depressed the sector, and investors sought the stocks as laggards. Fujitsu gained Y30 to Y950 and Sony Y120 to Y5,690. Meiji Seika, the most active issue on the day, was up Y10 at Y1,190 after reaching a high for the year of Y1,210. The issue has been popular on reports of the development of a cancer drug, but some investors were taking profits and shifting funds to other issues.

Mitsubi- shi Heavy Industries advanced Y9 to Y749 and Nippon Steel Y11 to Y436. Toyo Tire & Rubber surged Y100 to Y895 amid rumours that speculators have been switching from Nippon Carbon to Toyo. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 417.09 to 25,846.18 in volume of 62m shares. Tsuda- koma, the textile machine maker, Jumped Y150 to Y1,400 on reports that the company had developed the world's first \"fuzzy-logic\" controlled jet loom. Company officials said they would aim to market the product next year. Nintendo, the game maker, added Y300 at Y13,900. Inves- tors were encouraged by the decline in margin positions from a peak of 15m shares to a current Bm shares. Roundup CURRENCY concerns weighed on Australia and Taiwan in a generally quiet day for Pacific Rim markets. AUSTRALIA was held back by continued strength in the domestic dollar. The All Ordi- naries index ended down 1.3 at 1,555.8 after turnover of A$171m, against A$166m. Pacific Dunlop fell 12 cents to A$5.06 on a 36 per cent drop in profits, and a one-for-five A$673m rights issue to fund the takeover of Petersville Sleigh, the food producer. TAIWAN was dragged down by fears about the local cur- rencys .stength on corporate earnings. The weighted index dropped 33.74 to 4,532.25. Turn- over remained near the year's lowest levels, at T$10.30bn after T19.48bn. NEW ZEALAND was lifted by lower interest rates and ignored the rising New Zealand dollar. The NZSE-40 index closed 4.91 higher at 1,413.68 after turnover of NZ$14.3m, down from NZ$21.9m. Fletcher Challenge closed 3 cents lower at NZ$3.40. The stock has been under pressure since last week, when some analysts issued pessimistic earnings forecasts. MANILA was encouraged-by the government's push for a referendum to overturn the senate's rejection of a new mil- itary bases treaty with the US. The composite index improved 1.99 to 907.69. Philippine National Bank (PNB) and Ayala Land fell as a result of the senate's rejection. PNB closed down 12.50 pesos at 260 while Ayala Land declined 0.50 peso to 18.50. Oil shares proved more resilient on local buying ahead of oil drilling scheduled in November in the sourthern Philippines. HO1NG KONG failed to be lnpired by the overnight rally on all Street. The Hang Seng index ended 14.82 lower at 8,988.71 in turnover of HK$888m, down from HK$1.08bn. Investors were sidelined ahead of Jardine Matbeson Holdings' interim results, due today. SINGAPORE closed mixed after a firm opening. The Straits Times Indusral index lost 9.79 to 1,394.88 in turnover of S$55m, after S$49m. Newly listed Scotts Holdings was the most actively traded stock with 2.47m shares chang- ing hands. It closed 4 cents lower at S$1.02, below Mon- day's issue price of S$1.25. JAKARTA continued to fall in quiet trading. The index declined 6.8 or 2.4 per cent to 281.29 on volume of 3.2m shares, down from 5m. BOMBAY lost 1.8 per cent as the authorities banned forward trading in 20 stocks in an attempt to cool down the mar- ket. The BSE index fell 33.80 to 1,878.55 from Monday's record.",

   "text_content" : "BOURSES MOVED slightly higher yesterday, as certain sectors and individual stocks attracted interest, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ticked to the positive side of its recently nar- row trading range, following overnight gains in New York and Tokyo. The DAX index fin- ished 4.80 higher at 1,634.55 after a 0.70 decline to 676.60 in the FAZ at midsession; volume rose from DM3.5bn to DM4.1bn. Moves between the big cycli- cal sectors left carmakers and banks on the downside, while chemicals continued to show the modest actual or relative strength of the past few days. Bayer rose DM2 to DM290, firming after hours to DM291 on hopes that the company's meeting with fund managers in London yesterday would pro- duce good news. In Germany, Bayer was talking about tough global competition making it difficult to pass along environmental protection measures to custom- ers. Ms Jackie Ashurt, James Capel's European chemicals analyst, said this was common cause in the industry - which was also getting ready to impose its traditional, post- summer price rises. In the automotive sector, Porsche slipped another DM5 to DM710. Negative stories about earnings prospects and its own announcement about employee reductions out- weighed the stated interest by Mercedes-Benz in taking a stake in the sports car builder. BMW, which on Monday announced a four-day working week at its Munich plant, fell DM6 to DM510, although it emphasised that operatives would still be working the same number of hours a week. But the lorry maker, MAN, extended Friday's rally with a gain of DM6.80 to DM382.30 on its results for 1990-91. MILAN rose on the first day of the October account. Trad- ing centred on insurer Generall as it launched its large L1.7 trillion rights issue. The stock was steady at L25,870. The Comit index rose 3.78 to 545.39 in volume estimated at less than Monday's L119bn. There was some buying interest in state groups. Sme and Alivar rose in anticipation of a merger between the two food groups. Sme rose 4.4 per cent or L140 to L3,340 and Ali- var rose L230 to L11,170. In the telecommunications sector, Italcable fell 3.7 per cent or L245 to L6,350 on a report in a domestic newspaper that the company had lost its international monopoly. The report also said that AT&T would be promoting a service that would make telephone calls to the US up to 50 per cent cheaper. PARIS again retreated from its day's high to end almost unchanged, before the end of the monthly trading account on Friday. The CAC 40 index rose to 1,890.50, but closed only 0.16 up at a third successive year's high of 1,878.42. Turn- over was active at FFr2.8bn, after Monday's FFr2bn. There was good demand for individual stocks.

The stock gained FFrll or 2.9 per cent to FFr384 in volume of 347,750 shares. Legrand, the electrical parts maker, jumped FFr155 or 4.2 per cent to FFr3,840 after a smaller-than-expected fall in first-half profits. Accor continued to attract buyers after its recent weak- ness, rising to a day's high of FFr838 before closing FFr9 up at FFr829, while Casino, the retailer, gained FFr5.30 or 3.6 per cent to FFr153.10 in good volume of 310,050 shares. After the bourse closed, BSN said it would buy Casino's pre-cooked foods subsidiary. L Air lquiue anueu rssz T0 Pta697 before announcing a 6 per cent rise in first-half net profits after the market closed. AMSTERDAM ended barely changed as the release of the Dutch 1992 budget contained no surprises. The CBS ten- dency index rose 0.1 to 92.2. MADRID marked time in quiet trading. The general index eased 0.24 to 271.83 as turnover picked up from Mon- day's Pta8.6bn to about PtalObn, a third of which was accounted for by Telefdnica. The telecoms group gained Pta30O to Ptal,050 in 2.88m shares, after reports of a large order from a US buyer. STOCKHOLM was little changed in cautious trading as the conservative Moderate party leader, Mr Carl Bildt, set about forming a coalition gov- ernment. The Affirsvarlden General index rose 2.2 to 1,082.2 as volume rose to SKr359m from SKr311m. Astra was the day's most active stock as the free A shares rose SKr7 to SKr572. BRUSSELS was weighed down by a foreign investor's sale of a block of 11,300 shares in Delhaize, the retailer. The Bel20 index lost 1.35 to 1,111.49 in turnover of BFr836m. Del- haize accounted for 40 per cent of volume, falling BFr50 to BFr7,570 in 45,400 shares. Barco, the electronics com- pany which announces first- half results next week, dropped BFr40 or 4.1 per cent to BFr936. HELSINKI continued its slide on budget and devalua- tion fears. The Hex index fell 14.8 or 1.6 per cent to 905.6, 15 points above its year's low. OSLO's all-share index slipped below the 500 level. The index lost 3.75 to 499.13 in light turnover of NKrl88m. * 1i l i li",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor CORPORATE results contin- ued to restrain the London stock market yesterday. In spite of buoyant performances in other global trading centres and a Â£700m-plus takeover offer for Racal Electronics, which takes the total of bids now facing the market to more than Â£lbn, the FT-SE Index gave further ground. After regaining the Footsie 2,600 mark briefly, the market fell back to close 11.6 down at 2,594.4. Disappointing results from some companies in the retail sector followed on the heels of Monday's disclosure that UK retail sales had fallen 1.4 per cent in August, encouraging switching by the institutions out of consumer stocks and into capital goods issues. Trading volume was but- pg as ar * H M eps Sepae sep10 p 1 Sep 27 Oct 11 amVd DII Sep2 Oct 7 OCt21 tressed by further heavy turn- over in Racal Electronics after Williams Holdings, the UK industrial holdings group with big interests in the US, made an all-paper offer for the newly demerged electronics group. Dealers were surprised by Williams's move and Racal shares moved above the bid price as the market speculated on a counter-stroke being made by any one of several lead- ing names in the UK electrical and electronic industries. Equities opened firmly and soon recovered the Footsie 2,000 mark in the wake of good performances overnight -in Tokyo and New York and con- sident openings on the other European bourses. However, the UK market ran into early trouble as investors shied away from trading results from Fisons, the phar- maceuticals group, and Tesco, the food supermarket concern. There were also signs of technical strains as the Footsie index moved downwards in spite of a good premium on the Footsile future contract, which traditionally supports the underlying equity market. Marketmakers were passing stock between one another and, as so often recently, some large deals were held back until the end of the sessi.on, making it difficult for traders to identity the trend of the market; The day's total of shares traded through the Seaq sy- tem reached ea.1m, rivalling the figures last seen during the abortive coup in Russia and comfortably exceeding the 641.3m shares traded in the previous session. Strategists said the market was again \"stock specific\", with the institutions showing ready support for bid situa- tions and stock placings but also withdrawing quickly from areas in which confidence has faded somewhat. Hopes for a consumer-led recovery from the current recession appear to have been replaced by expectations that capital goods investment will provide the required impetus. Tesco and Kingfisher, both reporting profits yesterday, closed easier, and Marks and Spencer and GUS joined the lst ofhigh street stocks to lose favour. With currencies qui- eter, the international blue chips had little to show. ICI, although regarded as less likely to attract an all-out bid from Hanson, which is now occupied with its agreed offer for Beazer, shed very little ground. In contrast, there was solid demand for such heavy- weight names as British Gas and British Telecom. Strategists at the leading securities firms remained rela- tively bullish in spite of this week's setback for the market. At Hoare Govett, Mr Richard Lake repeated his short term Footsie target of 2,750.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Rival Bid for Racal Sought",
   "text_content" : "THE FIRST shots in the full-scale takeover battle for Racal Electronics so widely predicted by electronics spe- cialists were fired yesterday when Williams Holdings launched an all-paper Â£700m- plus offer for the company. Racal Electronics shares raced higher on the news and closed a net 6% ahead at 57%p, well above the all-share offer from Williams which values Racal at 50%p per share at yesterday's closing market prices. Turnover in Racal totalled 72m shares. Williams dropped 24 to 337p. In announcing the bid Wil- liams revealed it had built a 2.8 per cent stake in Racal follow- ing its demerger from Voda- sone. Dealers quickly decided that the Williams offer was merely an opening shot and that a counter-offer, or offers, may emerge as the takeover battle develops. It was pointed out that the huge level of turnover in Racal, after the \"special ex\" shares were officially traded, throughout Monday's stake- building exercise and during trading yesterday could easily have accommodated another holding of between 3 and 5 per cent. Any other holding in excess of 3 per cent would have to be revealed today. Most analysts agreed that Williams would have to increase its offer, to around 60p, in order to win control of Racal. The market's favourites to launch a counter-bid remained BTR, GEC, and Thorn EMI, although it was said that the last-named would need a substantial capital rais- ing exercise in order to finance such an offer. Fisons disappoints Disappointing interim results from Fisons served to knock 7 per cent from the value of the shares and under- lined the differences between City bulls and bears of the stock. Fisons posted first-half prof- its of Â£95.2m, an improvement of just 5.5 per cent on the pre- vious comparable figure and below the bottom of the range of analysts' forecasts. Researchers cut their esti- mates for the full year across the board. Among the bulls, Mr James Culverwell at Hoare Govett said Tilade, the asthma drug, should receive US approval shortly and made only a relatively small down- ward adjustment to his fore- cast for next year. Taking a more negative stance, UBS Phillips & Drew said it remained \"extremely cautious\" on the stock, while BZW took Â£15m from its already low full-year forecast to Â£245m. Fisons dropped 35 to 464p. Some 15m shares changed hands, making it the busiest day's trading for almost four years. \"Some people were very upset and were large sellers,\" said one trader. He added that there was good demand for the shares at lower levels. Strong BT showing BT delivered one of the best individual performances from a Footsie stock in the wake of strong American buying. Gold- man Sachs, the US investment bank, was said to have been a big supporter of the shares ahead of an expected announcement that it has been appointed .US lead manager to the flotation of the UK govern- ment's remaining near 48 per cent stake in BT. The shares settled 9 higher at 397p, having touched 398p, with 4.4m shares traded. Daiwa, the Japanese-owned securities house, was also a keen supporter of the shares, after a 40-page buy note pub- lished by Daiwa telecoms ana- lyst Mr John E. Clarke. The Daiwa analyst described BT as \"more than just a defen- sive utility\". He added: \"Annual earnings and dividend growth should exceed the likely UK industrial average over the next two years; cash flow is very strong, gearing will fall significantly.\" Doubts were raised over the safe haven qualities of the food retailing sector yesterday after Tesco revealed how much of an effect the recession is having on supermarket sales. Tesco fell 14 to 266p in busy trading after it announced with its interim results that sales growth had been significantly below that of the previous year. The other sector leaders weakened in sympathy. Argyll was off 8 at 296p, Asda was down 5 at 94p and J. Sainsbury slipped 9 to 355p. Although Tesco's half-time profits of Â£229.6m were in line with most forecasts, full year estimates were reduced by between Â£10m to Â£15m to Â£545m to Â£560m. Asda suffered the heaviest fall of the leading food retailers as 10in shares changed hands. The company announced that Mr Patrick Gillam, who is retir- ing as managing director of BP, will become chairman. But there was disappointment that as yet there is no word on a new chief executive. The oil sector took another pasting. Shell continued to sus- ser from the bearish stance adopted by Strauss Turnbull and dipped a further 6 to 506p on keen turnover of 6m. BP lost 5 at 327p, having been as low as 324p earlier in the session, with a heavier than usual 9.8m shares traded. The stock was depressed by revived stories that a hefty rights issue could be in the pipeline. Oil specialists thought this unlikely and pointed out that Mr Robert Horton, BP's chairman, had ruled out a rights issue when the group announced its interim figures on August 1. British Gas provided the only strong performance in the sector, climbing 7 to 275p on 7.8m traded, with the market said to have been relieved at the extent of its price cuts for supplies to power station cus- tomers. Executives from Brit- ish Gas's exploration and pro- duction division gave a presentation to the London Oil Analysts Group yesterday afternoon. There was a flurry of activ- FT-A AllShare Index Equity Shares Traded Tumover by volume (million) Excluding: Intra-muk buslnm & Ovwr turmoww Turr Exdue 600 400 200 0 ityi rect thee pan; shar befo gain Hi trade pan) zer. shai day' busi ers ahei cent divil Kl 5591; that Litt: mail also Rati profl ceni stoci S( agai exec pem Strc fronr heii keti decli W othc The as 1 prof yeai Ri groi EMI mui ity in Beaters after two incor- rect reports of a bonus issue in the stock appeared on the com- pany's own newswire. The shares were briefly 16'better before ending at 920p for a net gain of 4. Hanson saw heavy two-way trade the day after the com- pany launched a bid for Bea- zer. Turnover reached 26m shares, just below the previous day's level and the second busiest day this year. US buy- ers helped the stock move ahead 3% to 2l8p. United Friendly \"B\" jumped 27 to 414p following the 20 per cent increase in the interim dividend. Kingfisher dropped 11 to 559p on renewed speculation that it may be set to acquire Littlewood's privately-owned mail order business. There was also talk that it could bid for Ratners. Kingfisher's interim profits of Â£62.5m, down 4.4 per cent, were as expected by stockbrokers. Sears held broadly steady against a weaker market after it announced the appointment of Mr Liam Strong as chief executive. The stock closed a penny lower at 93p. But Mr Strong's pending departure from British Airways, where he is currently director of mar- keting, contributed to BA's decline of 2 to 183p. Whitbread featured in an otherwise dull drinks sector. The shares retreated 12 to 486p as Hoare Govett lowered its profits forecast for the current year from Â£255m to Â£227m. Rank Organisation lost ground as County NatWest rec- ommended a switch into Thorn EMI. Analysts visit Thorn's US music businesses starting today, and Rank's US leisure side at the weekend. Rank slipped 14 to 716p. Ladbroke shares went ex the rights issue yesterday and there was busy two-way trade in the nil-paid stock. Turnover there reached 10m as the price settled at 44p, below the day's best. Volume in the ordinary shares was a strong 2.9m as the price fell 13 to 270p xr. Forte was depressed by vague talk of a rights issue. The shares finished down 4 at 276p, after 274p. British Poly- thene accompanied its interim figures with a rights issue of two shares for every nine held at 285p to raise Â£15.4m. The stock advanced 8 to 354p. British Aerospace gave up 13 to 401p as the shares settled at their lowest level for over three years. Turnover reached 2.2m as the company held a meeting with investors yester- day afternoon. Hawker Siddeley gained 9 to 593p ahead of tomorrow's interim figures on above-aver- age turnover of 3m. Analysts expect profits to be in the range of Â£58m to Â£68m. There is still talk in the market that BTR may launch a bid for Hawker. IMI lost 9 to 252p on meeting profit-taking.

   "text_content" : "VIEWPOINT The Commerzbank report on German business and finance World automobile industry: growing international integration In 1991, the global output of passenger cars will register its first marked decline in five years, with all three major markets - North America, Western Europe and Japon - being affected. In Germany, the economic boost from unification will enable the market to buck the general trend for the time being. However, it seems that here, too, business will slacken during the second half of the year. Demand should rebound next year above all in North America and Western Europe, but this upturn will hardly be felt in Germany. The similarity of business trends in the car industry worldwide underlines the high degree of international integra- tion that has been achieved in automobile manufacturing. Competition, which is still quite stiff despite the continued existence of trade barriers, is reflected among other things in better equipped standard models, improved quality and longer guarantee periods, and, in the traditional markets, foreign suppliers have often been the driving force behind such improvements. Market penetration varies The role of foreign manufacturers differs considerably in each of the world's three leading markets. While US companies, for instance, are well rep- resented in Europe through thelocal sub- sidiaries of Ford and General Motors. the operations of the mqjor Europeans in North America are more modest Close ties exist between Japan and North America, as restricted market Shas prompted the Japanese to sact up production facilities of their own in the U.S. Howeer, American involve- ment in the Far East is limited to ac- COMMERZBANK i Geman 1l0owmow In g lobl fAn-ace - nmmd Apmem N p - w 90D -bmbL i Cib Abe% Odm COM 6M@IR k I @mftw.

Penetration by the Japanese and the Europeans of each others' markets also varies greatly. Due to restricted access in five EC countries, Japanese manufactur- ers are now keen to raise their share of the Western European market by es- New registr tablishing local assembly I 111le - plants. Such transplant Irmpws l. d i ii actnorics aruau cast in the UK and Portugal. By 1995, Japanese produc- tion capacity in Europe is to be expanded to one million units per year. Although European firms have seen their exports to Japan increase over the past fewyears, its import ratio remains very low. Europeans face the *)ec. imprt'\" double challenge of de- sending their position at home against competition from the Far East and, at the same time, securing a stronger footing in the dynamic Asian-Pacific region. At the end of July, the EC Commis- sion and Japan agreed that the Commu- nity's post-1992 Single Market will notbe fullyopenedtoJapanesecar eportsuntil the end of a seven-year transition period during which Japanese manu cturers wil not ship more than 123 million vehicles to Europe per year. This trans- lates into a Europe-wide market share of 8% as against the current 11%. National shares differ greatly, though, ranging from less than 1% in Italy to 42 % in Ireland (15.4% in Germany). In addi- tion, the agreement envisages that, over the same period, Japanese firms will sell 1.2 million cars produced at their Euro- pean plants in the EC market. This could bring the overall market share of Japa- nese producers up to 16% by 1999. French, Italian and Spanish manufac- turers would have preferred market access to have been restricted even fur- otins In the main automobile markets, 1990 -4.1% rom ECcountries ther. And, in a clear breach of the basic principles of the Single Market, they suc- ceeded in preserving national quotas until 1999. What is more, the EC Commission soon intends to implement measures to ease the inevitable adjustment for car- makers in countries with high import barriers. Yet these measures should not penalize national car industries that are already exposed to foreign competition. In any case, the experience of the eighties has shown that protective wall are not autonmatically used by their ben- eficiaries to improve competitiveness.",

After an Initial attempt at a rally, the cash market moved lower with dealers suspecting that a programme trade, weighted towards the sell side, had overhung the market Equity futures also retreated but at a slower pace. As the day wore on the premium expanded and at one stage reached 25 points. The September FT-SE closed at 2,611, down 12 points, while its premium finished at 16 against fair value of 7. Turnover in traded options remained buoyant, and with much of the business occur- ring in calls, investors using the options market may also be taking a more positive view for UK equities. Ultramar was the busiest option on speculation it would be dropped from the FT-SE 100 index. The largest trades were a buyer of 500 October 240 and 280 calls and a seller of 1,50- October 260 calls. A purchaser of 1,000 Hanson February 200 calls, 400 Scot tish Power December 120 calls and 500 Asda January 100 puts also boosted business.",
