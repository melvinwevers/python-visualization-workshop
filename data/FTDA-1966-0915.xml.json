This is the main decision to emerge from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which endet its discussions on Rhodesia yesterday with a communiqui agreed to even by Zambia, although it embodied consider able reservations by the Afro-Asians.

The British Prime Minister re fused to the end to accept then and then the African demand foi NIBMAR - no independena before majority rule-but he wil accept it on two conditions in thi future; first, if the Smith rdgime turns down his ultimatum, and secondly, if the Commonwealtl members of the Security Counci -Nigeria, Uganda and Nei Zealand - support a Britisl selective mandatory sanction resolution and do not try tc amend it into something mon extreme. Referendum Demand Refused Mr. Wilson was also prepared tc deflne his fifth principle-that anl smlenmnt reached must be accept ae-to the people of Rhodesia ai a whole--a meaning that a settle ment \"will be submitted to the people of Rhodala by appr6plat demooratic means.\" But he uec to accept the African demand for i referendum on the basis of one han one vote; in the British view acceptance by a cross.section ol politloal eaders, from Smith tc Nkomo and Sihole. or the _oc 3cd. .n- have to be \"acceptable to di Sworld community.\" The British plan is that th IY Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibb an should appoint a broadly bae i.

   "text_content" : "By Our ConmBa Editt'\" IN A DAY of exceptional activity on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, copper prices rose and waned according to the news of the moment. RST's announcement that, owing to the strike of Zam- bian mineworkers it had declared force majeure in respect of copper for shipment in October onwards, pushed the price of three-month wfrebars up to Â£416 a ton at one stage. It eventually closed at Â£410 10s a ton-an overall gain of Â£2. RST's move was followed by a similir announcement by the Anglo American Corporation, the other big mining group in Zambia. but no date was, given from when force miajeure would apply. .Later in the day the Zambian Minister of Labour stated that the mineworkers would be repaid the Â£6m. paid into the Zambia mines' local pension scheme-the cause ofthe dispute-but to avoid infla- tionay pressures the money would be paid out in phases. Although this led to hopes that the miners would return to work. and was Ihe direct cause of prices falling back on the LME. it is by no means certain that the miners are prepared to accept the terms. Roan Selection Trust has not produced any copper since the stfike started nearly three weeks ago, which means a loss of about 15.000 tons of refined metal.

There have been rumours that th- iS per cent. set.asides ordered by th- U.S. Governisent from Americar fabricators' stocks for defence put poses may. be increased to 20 per cent If this were so, then a lot more coppe would have to be found outside th States, and there are already sian that the U.S. physical market is be coming short of copper. There has been a good deal of U.S buying on the LME in the past si; weeks or so, and if all this metal i taken up the squeeze will certainl be felt here. Furthermore, th Chinese have .also been particularl active recently. One market sourc estimates that at least 16,000 tons ha been bought in the U.K.. and deliver will be taken within the next twi months.",

Comeback and crossbi path wools, 'which were reported to in short supply have not moved edic- as their supply position might hb er of indicated. tin Reports from the wool marl .cted make it clear enough that the cal pula- of the current general weaken y of of prices is reticence on the p -p is of buyers rather than anything 31m. do with the supply situation. What Bradford and elsewhere the ip is planation of the fall-off in wi i-ance purchases is quite straightforw- it it In common with other commoc nt. of markets, or indeed any mark which are finely balanced on I ok of profit margins, the high intel Agri- rates associated with the cr- mate squeeze have caused an immedi hort- round of destocking, almost imi nting ceptibl at any one point in et influential in the short term. It u- shows in the way spinners ofr es, worsted yarn .are delaying dell a veries of the wooltops they have ot on order. It shows, too, in the y slackening of orders for wool l. from the carpet manufacturers. ve This pattern of decreased r. demand is limited in duration. The in point must eventually be reached A. once again when wool users have ol run down their stocks to a new rd level and must buy wool at the h- same rate as they use it. Opinions has vary on when this stage is reached. lew but trade sources have suggested ilia that it cannot be much more than iing one or two months hence. There- red after, what happens is dependent be on the effect of deflationary eco- tip nomic policies on the overall level ave of consumer demand. So all the pointers in the wool ,ket market are that the big questibns use will be settled in January, when the ling bulk of this season's Australian )art wool clip reaches the market. By to then the current round of appre- In hensive destocking will have run ex. its course, and the predictions of rool an international wool shortage will ard. have been tested. By then, too, dity many of the six month or twelve kets month contracts on which wool low users buy their supplies from the rest combers and topmakers will be up edit for renewal; their renewal will iate doubtless depend on the level of per- consumer demand, and the depre- the dations of the Prime Minister's uite threatened level of unemployment.",

PRICES CONTINUED to move $1 or so higher on Wall Street to-day, following failure of earlier profit-taking and other selling to harm values materially, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decisively broke through the 800 level. After a day's high and low of 809.02-789.58, the Industrial Aver- age finished at 806.23, for a rise of 10.75 on the day and an advance of 30.68 for the past three sessions. The Railroad Index rose 2.79 on the day to 201.23 and the Utilities Index was lifted 2.12 to 128.60. Volume, however, decreased 620,000 shares to 6.25m. Numerous operators were await- ing Washington developments. Re- ports said tax incentive suspension advocated by President Johnson to help curb inflation seemed likely to be accepted by the House Ways and Means Committee, but it would consider steps that might make the proposals more acceptable to busi- ness.

This reflected the belief in Wall Street quarters that any suspension of the Investment Tax Credit would have little, or no, effect on earnings. Among Airlines. North West ad- vanced $4% to $99 and Eastern improved $3 to $78%. KLM spurted 8% to S149,. aided by short-covering.

Trading was relatively active, largely due to increased volume in the specula- tive market. Steel Company of Canada lost 5% on the Finance Minister's request that its price increases be rescinded and this tended to depress other parts of the market. Dominion Foundries also dipped $%. International Nickel gained 51% to 583%, despite a strike of its workers at Sudbury and Port Colborne.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent OTTAWA, Sept. 14. 'IArAnA :.--- --.-a-- a-- am- -., . . .iSNALAs IItiance Miaister, Mr. Mitchell Sharp, has urged the Steel Company of Canada (Stelco) to roll back its announced steel price increases. Mr. Vincent W. Scully, president of Stelco, has told Mr. Sharp that the company will re- consider its decision. On Tuesday Stelco announced price increases averaging about 3 per cent. on some main product lines. Mr. Sharp, in an effort to persuade Stelco to rescind the increases and to head off similar price rises by other major steel producers, telephoned Mr. Scully in Hamilton, Ontario. He read the president a public statement in which he contended that Stelco could finance recent wage increases and other costs out of increased produc- tivity. He warned that if the increases were not rescipded he would ask the joint CommnonsSenate Committee on Consumer Credit to invqstigate the steel price ris. A - pokemanma-or Mr. Sharp said- Mr. Scully had agreed to consider the increases. While Mr. Sharp's statement was directed at Stelco, he added, it applied equally to other steel producers. The Transport Minister, Mr. J. W. Pickersgill, has reacted mildly to the announcement by the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways that they will increase freight rates by 10 per cent. The increases take effect on October 10 and Involve approxi- mately 30 per cent. of freight traffic. Mr. Pickersgill told newsmen that he did not consider the increase to be inflationary. He noted that the in- creases would not have any more serious economic effect than if the Federal Government had granted a subsidy to meet increased railway costs. The Opposition leader, Mr. John Diefenbaker, disagreed: \"This is another step in the inflationary ipirl. There appears to be no end in sight. Th onvernment, seemingly unable'to cope, shut' up shop and 'dosed SPirHfaent.' I",

AMERICA is in a troubled. nained vinrn-alv for the Feelins rn the Vitnm iTi tea ware AMERICA is in a troubled, anxious and basically conservative i mood. This, if anything, is the conclusion to be drawn from the , results of yesterday's big batch of primary elections. The voters re- jected experiment and innovation, and they rejected them particularly strongly when faced with a clear i choice on the two great issues of the day-the Vietnam war and the I position of the Negro. . A startling, and deeply significant defeat for the Liberal cause came in the, Maryland election for a democratic nominee for the Gover- norship race. Here an elderly i Baltimore contractor, George P. Mahoney, who started off a poor third in a three-man race, finished first almost entirely by virtue of his fierce opposition to fair housing for negroes. His young opponent, Congress- man Carlton Sickles, had cam- aigned vigorously for the desegregation of housing, while se Mahoney's campaign had been ex- w lusively devoted to an appeal to p he fears of the white population c th of the Baltimore-Washington Met- Ri ropolitan area. ca A Democratic candidate for A he U.S. Senate former Massachusetts th Governor Endicott Peabody, won la handsomely in spite of his support \" or civil rights, but liberals can take m small comfort from this, since his opponent, Mayor Collins, of Boston, had not made an issue out of race, th ad was doomed in any case by H having made too many local enemies cr n the course of four years of strong p, ity Government. its The Administration's Civil Rights at Bill with its open housing section, Ki is already heading for defeat in the D4 Senate this week, and the Maryland G esult will undoubtedly stiffen the be opposition of those senators who (it have been waiting to see how in trongly the wind is blowing. an Feelings on the Vietnam issue were seen most clearly in New Jersey. where confessed \"peace\" candidates put in a number of races for demo- cratic nominations. In the biggest of these, David Frost, a lecturer at Rutgers University. who had advo cated a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, lost the nomination for the Senate by a large margin to Warren Wilents, a machine\" politician, who was a moderate Johnson supporter. A spectacular result in Minnesota points, if anything, to the limits of the Administration's direct appeal. Here the local Democrat party-a creation and fiefdom of Vice- President Humphrey-had chosen as its nominee for Governor, the young. ambitious Lieutenant Governor A. M Keith over the head of the incumbent Democratic Governor Karl Rolvaag Governor Rolvaag. claiming he had been victimised by the \"bosses\" (including Mr. Humphrey) persisted in running in the rimary yesterday and won handsomely.",

This was artfully screened before top execu- H tives of the Raytheon Company in then Chicago one bitter, snowy, winter prod day. It persuaded them to establish trati a new operation of the firm's Space Sani and Information Systems division year in the West. - ploy Other companies quickly got the doul message. In an attractive setting in tl close to the Pacific Ocean, General com Motors' human and electronic 60 ti brains work on the design of moon incre surface vehicles, underwater ex- near ploration craft and. now, the new and light-gas gun that can launch aboi miniature space models at speeds bigg of up to 25,000 feet per second, T1 to study their behaviour under wan simulated conditions. Soul General Electric's TEMPO divi- coui sion, all brains and no brawn, he 1 wrestles with advanced problems to I in disciplines (mathematics, look hysics. computer technology) lethodologies (economic analys 4gistics) and programmes (as6- pace, missiles, information YOs- sms). The Industrial Products ivision of Hoffman Electronics oncentrates on research into el- ronic products and systems. Some companies have sent their 'brains\" a long way to Santa larbara: for example. Edgerton, lermeshausen and Grier, a rising Irm in nuclear science and oceano. ;raphic engineering is based in loston. Massachusetts; and Varo, vhich specialises in the manafac- ure of motor, generator, and uning fork products, has its head- luarters in Garland. Texas. HOw- Ã½ver. if these and similar operations ire far from base, they are close o the major customers for their )roducts. Less than 100 miles iway is the vast military and *ivilian aviation industry of Los Angeles, where much oi the key vork in space exploration, under he direction of the National Aero. lautical and Space Administration, s also carried out. Moreover, directly to the north Ind south of the community are wo of the leading research facili- ies in the country of the U.S. nilitary: Vandenberg Air Force ,ase (the site of many missile aunchings), and the Navy's space nstallation at Point Hueneme. also in the vicinity are the Atomic .nergy Commission's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and Los klamos Laboratories. Fourfold Rise Hard-headed business reasons, :hen, as well as the climate have ,roduced the exceptional concen- tration of research facilities in Santa Barbara over the past 10 years. Local industry now em- )loys nearly 6,400-more than double the 2,900 total of 1957: in the same period, the number of :ompanies has trebled, rising from 50 to 184; and annual payrolls have increased close to four times, to searly $46m. Only agriculture and oil, generating revenues of about S70m. each per annum,. are bigger. The visiting businessman who wants to know what is going on in Southern California now must, of :ourse, visit Los Angeles. But if he wants to know what is going to happen later, he ought also.to look in at Santa Barbara.",

   "text_content" : "The 18th annual general meeting of B.H.D. Engineers Limited was held on September 14 in London, MR. F. BRIAN HOLMES, M.lnst Gas.E. (the chairman), presiding. TI following is his report which has been circulated to share- ,boldern: .I am pleased to report that the fprt:or the year ended March i31s. 1966. was the highest in the hitory of the Group. This is par. t pleaing in view of the somwat 'isappointing results of the previous year which, as I ex- plaied at the time, were chiefly due to certain members of the Group meeting temporary prob- leu during that period. Flansial Results The comparative figures are as follows:- The Group Trading Profit for the year is Â£1.000,635 compared with Â£819,426 in the year ended 31st March, 1965, This Profit is before charging Depreciation, which is substantially the same as last year, Â£293,478 as against Â£298.713, and again reflects the con- tinuing expenditure on fixed assets incurred by the Group during the year and the resulting incidence of Initial and Investment Allowances. After charging Depreciation. Debenture Interest and other ex- penses, the Group Trading Profit before Taxation is Â£576,509 as against Â£405,645. Taxation absorbs Â£254.791 compared with Â£242,060 in 1965. After providing for the interest of Minority Shareholders in subsidiary companies, the Profit after Taxation amounts to Â£313,766 as compared with Â£157,922 in the previous year. In view of the better trading re- sults, your Board has decided to recommend to members a Final Dividend of 19%, and this. with an Interim of 10%. makes 29% for the year compared with 27Y % a year ago. Turning to the Consolidated Bal- ance Sheet. the total Capital and Reserves are increased by Â£228,907 to Â£3,193,223. Fixed Assets at Â£1,646.318 show an increase of Â£117,856. Stock and Work in Pro- gress is Â£119,495 higher. Debts and Prepayments exceed Creditors and Accrued Charges by Â£218,553 more Sthan a year ago. mgu These figures when viewed -m against the background of con- tinual rising costs of labour and th material and the farther burdens to placed on industry by legislation, som will I feel sure be considered svery be satisfactory; and refict very great ch* credit on our management, staff of and workpeople who by their efforts have enabled these results __ to be attained. ste Subdiaries' Activtles tri I should particularly mention h The Bryan Donkia Co. Ltd. and Cc W.-C. Holnes & Co. Ltd. both of de whom have achieved improved of radiWs results this year. wi The discovery of gas in the re North Sea is obviously of consider- - able interest to those companies within the Group which have CO served the gas industry in the past ap and have continued to for its Of ever changing needs. Bryan w' Donkin Co. Ltd., because of its U comprehensive range of traditional C equipment for-gas distribution. and w the introduction of a full range of c High Pressure Regulators in asso- \" ciation with The Rockwell Manu- so facturing Co., of Pittsburgh, and t of Horizontal Compressors in sh association with Crepelle et Cie., of Lille, is well placed to meet the sh calls that may be made upon it f\" arising from the new development. Meanwhile the immediate success t- of the introduction of these new so products in addition to an expand- pr mg demand for existing products, Cc has creied i; need for both in- ne creased financial facilities and pro- duction capacity. To help meet the needs for added production capacity, it has been a arranged that W. C. Holmes & Co. w; Ltd.. will, in the course of time, take over the manufacture of the Roots type Exhausters. Blowers e and Meters. now bein made at c. Donkins, thus releasin space, si labour and plant for Donkin's new in products. sa Whilst this arrangement will un- cr Sdoubtedlv be of benefit in that it p, 7 will enable the manufacture of the h comolete range of Roots type a\" Smachines to be' rationalised, it has su in turn created a problem of pro- ar . duction capacity at Holmes. th d New Acquisition th S This has been met by the pur- e chase of the business of R.B.S. ex-I",

Indeed all the expenses of running a manufac* turing business have risen during the year faster than any time I can remember. Although output of the whole group is about 5%% higher than last year and thus coastitutes a record, increased expenses largely attributable to the Government had to be absorbed by the Companies.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own.Correpondent BONN, Sept. 14. Dr. Erhard to-day asked the Bundestag for greater power to manage the economy without whiMc, he said, a succesul economic policy was no longer possile. His proposals, the Bill to promote economic stability, would in practice inject a bit of Keynes into the Chancellor's-social market economy. They would also moderate the financial federalism imposed on West Germany by the World War II allies. t,. -, The Government, Dr. Erhard said, wanted to avoid at all costs taking measures such as a wage and price freeze, partial exchange control or drastic taxation on consumer goods. Though the economy is under- going inflationary strains, few economists, if any, would prescribe measures as far reaching. The Minister of Economics, Herr Kurt Schmuecker, said explicitly that it would be both unreasonable and mischievous to pretend that the country was in an economic crisis. Wide Agreement The Bundestag debate on the First Reading of the Bill showed a, wide agreement on much of the Government's proposals. But their precise fate is still uncertain since they hinge on amending the Con- stitution to permit Bonn to ration borrowing by the Laender. This requires a two-thirds majority and could,.therefore, be blocked by the Social Democratic Opposition. Its spokesman, Dr. Karl Schiller, said his party was ready to talk about 'the Constitutional change-pro. vided a number of conditions were met. -The conditions, phrased with a probably deliberate vagueness, in clude more Parliamentary control over the way in which the Govern- ment may use the pdwers it wants, together with the introduction of San incomes policy, though not one of a mandatory character. Having been through the wars lately, the Chancellor is relying heavily upon his Bill and the 1967 Budget to restore his duthority in the country, and over the Christian Democratic Party. The preamble to the Bill commits the Government to maintain a high rate of employment external equili- brium, and \"appropriate\" economic growth. The \"appropriate\" is significant, since the background to the Bill is that it has not proved possible to reconcile stability with the former high growth rates The Federal and Land Govern. ments are to be empowered to free-z funds in a Reserve against Economic Contingencies\" if the pressure of demands calls for a reduction of public spending."

Although the plan ais en in operation for some seven years, it is still too early to Iraw final conclusions, but so far the signs are very encouraging. If the experiment comes up to ex- pectations certain selected areas ould yield as much as 15 per cent. more timber. Although just over half of Sweden is covered by pine, birch aid spruce, the forest products in- dustry is facing a shortage of raw Materials. The growth of large ,mils with an ever-increasing throughput has put demands for raw materials to a point where any ncrease in felling would be at the xpense of the current replacement rate. Large-scale Trial So far it has been found that the best fertiliser is urea, which con- ains 46 per cent. nitrogen. Using this formula, it has been found that the trunk of the trees grow aster, the annual rings become broader and the height is increased. The first really large-scale trial is being made this year, when some 5,000 tons of urea is being spread over an area of 60,000 hectares by means of a number of small light aircraft operating from runways in the forest. The use of nitrogen, t is stated, also stimulates the soil and starts a cycle-foliage is healthier and when it falls in the utumn the ground again receives i more nitrogen. Fertilising was started on an experimental scale in 1957 and irborne spreading two years later. So far nearly 1,000 test areas have been treated with various prepara- tons. In 1964 some 1,200 tons of rcea was spread over 8,300 hec- tres. Over the next seven to eight years SCA plans to spend more tan Kr.40m. (Â£2.8m.) on improv- in 280,000 hectares with nitro- enous fertilisers. After the new seven- to eight-year plan has been completed, 280,000 hectares or about 20 per cent. of I he company's forest holdings will I be continuously treated with ferti- I lisers. The expected yearly lumber- I SPwASH LORRIES j ing ain of IS per cent. corresponds i to some 130,000 tons of newsprint s or 70,000 tons of high.grade paper x pulp. t Of utmost importance is choos- ing the right age for the stand that is to be treated. It has been found that a practical fertilisation plan which produces an extra volume of growth of 14 cubic metres per hectare during a seven-year ycle in a middle-aged stand, will only produce half this increase in an old stand of equal quality. According to the company, growth responses recorded so far after fertlisation show that timber production, sup- < A Pier spraying fert~ier. -~\"~Â·UIUVU nÂ·u 1 ipemented by a supply of nitrogen a can be remunerative. To optimise the programme the I profitability must be evaluated for each stand. Various long-term con- t sequences must also be considered from both a silviculture and a log- i ging point of view. Since the trees will grow more rapidly than normal , it may not be possible to leave the timber for the normal span, and t harvesting may have to be com- I pleted earlier owing to increased stand density. The cost of fertilisation can be t broadly placed under four main * headings: transport costs, cost-of I fertiliser, dissemination and miscellaneous. Under the last head- ing costs are included for the c,-U struction of airstrips and the settin up of markings for the areas to bW) treated. The average total cost so , spreading urea on a large scale !i from aircraft is currently Kr.0.60.' per kilogram. As the fertilisation - of the area is increased and after the second fertilisation, logginlg operations will include more nd ' more forests previously treated. ; To aid the airborne operations i the company plans to add some 20: to 30 airstrips a year in suitable locations. The strips, wfch in busy areas will be paved, will be constructed in co-ordination with s 14pauibIn 01 inÂ® letworM 0or forest roads for motorised equip- ment. The experiment is part of a long- term plan to combat rising labour costs, falling market prices and increased competition from other European and especially North American producers. The Swedish pulp and paper industry feels that the only way of maintaining its present position is to rationalise and step up production. So far SCA has invested about Kr.tOOOm. to this end over the last 10 years and the present plan- of forest fertilisation represents a logical step at the beginning of the pulp and paper chain.",

Referring to the industry's pros. cts, the report says that these de- nded mainly on the industry's ility to man the profitable longlife lieries, to increase productivity, d to develop its markets. \"The total, demand for energy is ing and, even with the develop- mnt of nuclear power and the dis very of natural gas under the rrth Sea, it may well be that more al will be needed after 1970 than rrent estimates suggest,\" com. snts the report.

   "text_content" : "From Our-Own Correspondent CAPE TOWN. Sept 14. Mr. Vorter, the new South African Premier, went on the air for a ten-minute fireside chat with the nation to-night, without revealing any fundamental change from the direction being followed by Dr. Verwoerd. It therefore remains for him to give a more definite pointer to what he has in mind in Parliament next week. In his first Parliamentary appear- anea an Premier earlier to-dav. he I Muller. a successful country ane asI rrCuucr CWJiUICE l y, r Iu made a brief speech in which he said that while he was transferring certain of his former Cabinet powers, he would continue to head police matters, making himself responsible for the safety of the State--\"until we are in calmer waters.\" Pledge He added: \"For five years I have woken up and gone to bed with these problems.\" At the same time he pledged his belief \"in Parliamentary procedure and in Parliament, and I will make it my duty always to uphold everything that Parliament stands for.\" He no doubt felt compelled to make this pledge to placate what- ever misgivings there might be about the days when he was a less than passionate supporter of Par- liamentary democracy. Mr. Vorster's move to the Premiership has been carried out with the slightest disturbance pos- sible.to the Cabinet, his only moves being to appoint a new Minister of Justice'and Prisons in the person of Mr. P. C. Pelser-a close per- sonal friend and Deputy Speaker- and a Deputy Minister in Mr. S. L. MiUier, a sucessrI cOUDTV, attorney. The Premier also announced in Parliament that he was appointing a Warren Commission-type investi- gation into the assassination of Dr. Verwoerd. The Judge will ,e Mr. Justice van Wyk, South Africa's judge at the World Court. Reuter reports that Mr. Botha, Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, said that the train. ing of African leaders for the \" Bantu- stans\" was an urgent educational task. In a speech read on his behalf at the 50th jubilee celebrations of the Fort Hare University College for non- whites, Mr. Botha said it was impera- tive, if the policy of separate de. velopment of white p and Africans was to succeed, that a corps of highly- trained specialists should become available. They would be needed for the Transkei, the country's first and as yet only \"Bantustan,\" and the various African territorial authorities en- trusted with guiding their people along the road of self-realisation and independent development, he said. Mr. Botha's speech was the first ministerial statement dealing with \" antustans,\" the partially self- governing African areas destined for full independence, since the assassina. tion of Dr. Verwoerd.",

According to conference sources, the Midwest region to-day said it favoured such a loose federation, in which the Army and police would be under regional authority. This, according to the sources, is close to the positions of the North and Eastern delegations, which have proposed some kind.of confederation comprising virtually independent regions. LAGOS, Sept. 14. The Western region, on the other hand, was said to favour a federation of a number of States linked by a fairly strong central Government. The West's position may to some extent be backed by a northern dele- gate, Mr. J. S. Tarka, representing the middle belt area, a minority and mainly non-Moslem region in the southern part of the vast Moslem North.

The announcement said that Mr. Dally will be returning to Lon- don soon and will later return to Damascus to report to the Syrian Government on the decision of the IPC Board. Negotiations began in Damascus last Saturday and two teams have held four sessions on Syria's re- quest for higher transit royalties on the I.P.C. pipeline passing through Syrian territory from the oil fields of Northern Iraq. The exact details of the Syrian request have not been disclosed, but the Premier, Dr. Youssef Zayyen, has said that Syria had been getting less than half of what it should be getting in transit royalties during the past 10 years. Damascus Radio also reported that both teams will continue sessions in Damascus during Mr. Dally's absence in London to discuss details of the expenses of IPC in Syria during the past 10 years. Syrians claim that IPC is overcharging expenses, which cuts into the Syrian share of royalties.",

   "text_content" : "S By Our Georgtown Correspondent ANY DAY NOW, the Guyana i Government will award a contract 1 to an international company to 1 study and report on the hydro- electric possibilities of two sites. Eight months later, the consultant is expected to submit his report- and it is generally assumed that this report will conclude that Guyana can provide hydro-electric power at a cheap, economic rate. The next decade should then see Guyana served not only with t hydro-electric power scheme, but also with an aluminium smelter that could use half the power avail- able from it. The two projects, cheap power and an aluminium smelter, have been linked with each other for some years. It is ironic that power in. Guyana should be amongst the most expensive in the world. For the word Guyana, itself Amerin- dian (the original people of the country), means land of waters- and Guyana is, in fact, served with several mighty rivers and water- falls, including the Kaieteur which has the highest natural drop in the world. Thus, it is natural that the Guyanese have been looking at the possibilities of hydro-electric. power for some considerable time. Alcan Bauxite Subsidiary The cost of installing such power : has meant that a main user, or users, for the bulk of it must be i found. Eyes have turned inevitably a towards Demerara Bauxite, a sub- sidiary of Alcan, known as Demba This company is mainly re- I sponsible for the fact that to-day i Guyana is among the world's top five producers of bauxite, the raw material used for smelting into aluminium. Would Demba erect a smelter if the necessary power a were provided at economic rate? J Without a positive answer to this t question, it seemed, any hydro- % electric power scheme would I hardly' come in the foreseeable a future. At the same time, it was i pointed out that Demba could not 1 commit itself to the erection of a s lamuitee tie production 1or cuap MR twer. aluri Decisions were taken a month tend; ao which should lead to both of b -es prooeots becoming realities, undo Ihough it was hard to say which mani ama rst-the chicken or the egg. in t \"he cene was Canada, and the two indu ain figures were Mr. L.

The All this did not find wholesale. wer ceeptance In Guyana. Dr. Cheddi sites agan, the Leader of the Opposi- O on, who has headed the two pre- the ous Governments, points out that Mac JN experts have told Guyana that baul n aluminium smelter will pay for at I self out of profits in ten years; itsel he Government, he believes, bigg ,ould plan immediately for a joint UN }oceiveonclytw7 pr ojct . mbro e icome earned by the integrated auxite-aluminium industry. Jagan Reservations on Smelter In a recent statement, Dr. Jagan aid be had grave doubt that Alcan ntended to set up a smelter in 3uyana. He pointed out that klcan's associate, Alcoa, already. iqs a smelter in Surinam, Guyana's astern neighbour. Linke as it is nith the European Common Mar- et, bSurinam's aluminium can enter euty, pree into the European narket, a facility not open to 3uyana. He warned that the 3uyana Government \"must not call into the trap of merely pro- nucing electricity and providing it heap to Alcan to smelt aluminum e are. At the moment, anyway, the 3uyana Government is pursuing he two as distinct, though related, arojects. There is no thought yet nbout an aluminium smelter being et up on a national basis. Mean- while work goes ahead on thea iydro project. Since 1950 UN ex- Ierts have carried out four surveys, he latest of them concluded in t962 When theb Suthledge Report was issued. Some sites were con. luened as being too small, others s being too far away, and so on. uhc report recommended that there were really only two worthwhile les. One of these is at Tiger Hills, upt he Demerara River and above Wlackenzie, where Demba has itse auxite installations. The other ist it Tiboku, on the Mazaruni River,in tself a branch of the country i agest sriver, the Essequibo. The eN is spending t875,000 on at Nisspending S875,000 o loverpmentowned project embranc d ag a flyrodlictric scheme and an a luminlum smelter. Dr Jagan con. ft ends that Guyana, as a producer w if bauxite, is being cheated by the a nderpricing of bauxite and the E lanipulation of the price structure I a the bauxite-alumlna-aluminium sl adustry. The Caribbean countries, p ie says, produce 80 per cent. of the a aw material for the North n Lmerican aliminium industry but eceive only 17 per cent. of the c r r r I I s L lele At th momnt, nywa, n, e;aaGvrmeti uun ITtoa itnt tog~rltd ITjcs heei othuh e Ibu nauiim mle en bp po ntoa ass en rlÃ½ ok osaed nte C scr rjc.Snc 90U x net aecridou orsres ti'att fte onldd i 092we h uhcpRpn1 yrsise.Sm ie eecn fetd a eigtosalohr Csbigtofraaads n t] eotrcm eni httee s reall onl twowortwh is Oneof hes isat ige Hilsupa levelopment survey of the two sites and the Guyana Government a Eurther S285,000. Most of the work will be concentrated on the Tiboku krea. The reason for this is that Demba itself surveyed the Tiger Hills site as long ago as 1957, spending more than $500,000 in the process, and made its findings available to the Guyana Govern- ment. The use of thermal power in connection with the use of either Mr. Forbes Burnham of the two locations will be con- sidered. But the Guyana Govern- ment wants to choose the site which best fits the need of the :ountry as a whole. Guyana's own needs will then be examined by experts in the form of a power market survey on future require- ments, so that the size of instal- lation and its timing can be planned. Then will come a feasi- bility study to find out when inter- mational banking institutions could secure a loan for the project. These things all take time-eight months for the site survey, another two years for a preliminary survey on requirements, and a further five years for erecting a dam. No one, then, expects hydro- power in Guyana for some eight yearqvat the least. But the confident hape is that this will come-and, with-it an aluminium smelter.",

   "text_content" : "PUBLICITY DRIVE BY LLOYD'S Sy r o5f= hg Cermepodeu SLloyd4, the W;ond iWsuandu institution, is making its rt, tefr tative, step towards publicing Ie Brdn it wide range o SAs part of a \"long-ter , t.o latons.\" programme,\" t wIA invite 200 gueIt to a dinner in Man- cheter on October 11. The hosts at the dinner will be Mr. R. W. Sture, chairman. of Lloyd's, and the Committe. of Lloyd's. The guests willn incude the -Lord Mayor of Manchester, the Recorder, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, together with prominent Manchester and North of England fiures in busi- , industrial and insurance The object of the dinner, regarded rather nervously by Lloyd's aS a pilot scheme, will be to focus interest on the competitive, inventive and flexible insurance services provided by Lloyd's. Competition In choosing Manchester for its first British public relations venture Lloyd's has been influenced by the comparatively small volume of busi- ness that comes to it from the north of England. \"Insurance companies are strongly entrenched in the Mid. lands and the North of England and we want to break their hold,\" said a Lloyd's spokesman last night. If this first public relations exer- cise proves successful Lloyd's may follow it with other dinners and promotions. It is only in Britain that Lloyd's has been reluctant to go in for publicity. Similar exercises have already been carried out successfully in the U.S., Japan, Australia and Norway. \"DIRTY, DUSTY AND DARK\" FORGES Financial Times Reporter Some of Britain's forges, housed in old buildings with a gloomy atmosphere, underline the general impression of an inddstry in which dirty, dusty, and dark conditions are \"irremediable\" features. In spite of many new constructions. there is still \"a class of buildings beyond hope,\" and much is needed to bring others up to modern standards. A report by the Joint Standing Committee on Health, Safety and Welfare in the Drop Forging Industry, published to-day urges the industry to \"look carefully\" at its recommendations, as a result of which, it was hoped, schemes of improvement would beprepared for every forge in the industry.\" In some forges workers had re- sorted to patching up openings in the walls with sacks and bags. Broken window-frames were often eft broken, and \"even when repaired they are not reglazed.\" Lighting Problem The problem of lighting required urgent attention-there was no tech. nical reason for the exclusion of light from any forge. All of them should have windows in the upper structure of the walls. The industry would benefit, too, from new artificial light- ing systems properly desianed by ex- perts and periodically maintained and cleaned. The report reminds the industry that the Factories Act stipulates the daily removal of trade refuse from floors and benches and the cleaning of the floor each week. \"If these re- quirements were observed in the spirit ald letter, \"here would be much Itm- provement,\" SWorkers were reluctant to wear goggles or other eye protection: the ndustry should endeavour to over. come this reluctance. The same applied to safety boots, and to fire. proof clothing: a forge worker's clothing, soaked with oil and grease, was readily combustible. Some person \"of suffcient status\" was to super. vise the safety organisation in each foree. Conditions In the Drop Forging Industry 1954.1964: S.O.. S 6d.

   "text_content" : "\"' 'i ::9 c it 5 :'1 This IBM Specialist worked 4 months underground in a iron oremine above the Arctic Circle Meet Mr. Gdran Wastlund, process control specialist, IBM Sweden. For 4 months he spent all his working hours under- - ground in LKAB's Kiirunavaara mine, one of the world's largest iron ore mines, at the far northern tip of Sweden. Why? To help ensure the uniform quality of the Kiruna mine's iron ore and its efficient transportation by underground trains. He developed a computer program that directs each train according to the quality of each load, to its correct dumping area. His program also chooses the best routing to avoid bottlenecks. It handles 2,000 wagon movements daily, controls 18 trains. The system is exceptionalloflexible. It can send trains from point to point in a network of nearly 100 different locations. Most other automatic systems in use today are limited to.about 30 destinations. What's more, the IBM computer program achieves this without stopping the train. That means no waiting, no lost time. The results: more iron ore pours oubof the Kiirunavaara mine. This plentiful, high quality ore is used in the steel mills of Germany, Belgium, Great Britain, France and, Scandinavia. Your control problem is probably above ground, Perhaps it's the best use of machine tools, testing equip. ment, plating equipment, or component assembly machines. Whatever it is, there's,an IBM specialist ready to help you solve it. .Wherever you are. IBM A fMPANV N1lWl TNT URTFIV I, I Â· Â· Â· Â· ~) Â· Â· Â· ' .. * a R A INTrn nS3",

The Board says that \"the road system is sure to be improved and made capable of handling much more traffic as a result of the London Transportation Study now being. made by the Government and the GLC. \"But it seems quite unlikely- perhaps it will be demonstrated as totally undesirable-that the roads will be designed to allow everyone who wishes to drive a car into central London to do so. Even with the present road system there are things that must be done to limit the impact of congestion on bus services.\" Services, could not, the Board warns, be expected to improve signi. ficantly by the mere expenditure of large sums of money on road build. ing. The only solution was for the authorities to devote great energy to freeing the flow of traffic in the interest of bus passengers. Within the centre of London (the City and the West End) single.deck buses-similar to \"Red Arrows \"- worked by one man and with a flat fare rate, would provide limited-stop services between points with large numbers of intending passengers. -Main railway stations were a case in point. Suburban Routes In the suburbs local routes would be based on the business and shop- ping centres, and serve as feeders to the trunk routes and stations. They would be single-deck, one-man buses with much shorter routes than most existing suburban routes. Travel at a discount would also form part of the plan and on the one- man buses with ticket dispensing machines, people would be able to buy \"stored fares \"-books of tickets bought in advance.

   "text_content" : "OVER Â£7%m. wasu pent n Press and TV advertising in the U.K. in the seeoad quarter of this year, an increase of just over Â£935,000 on the figure for the corresponding period of 1965. This, according to calculations made by The Statistical Review of Press and Television Advertising brings the total for the first half of 1966 to nearly Â£151m., an in- crease of 2% per cent. over the total for the first six months of 1965. Ptest advertising expenditure by the Government in the past quar- ter was over Â£1.6m., representing a rise of more than 27 per cent. over the same period of 1965. In addi- tion, nearly Â£166,000 was spent on TV. The introduction of credit card systems has led to greatly increased advertising by the banks which spent over Â£960,000 (mostly in the Press) in the second quarter, corn- ,pared with 4493,000 in the same period of 1965. The largest contributor was Barclays (Â£184,329) followed by Lloyds (Â£110,829) and Midland (Â£75,851). The National Provin- cial Bank spent Â£52,653 on adver- tising its banking services and an additional Â£72,204 in support of its travel cards. Westminster Bank, which is not yet issuing credit cards, spent Â£73,388 on advertising general facilities. In the first half of this year the banks spent over Â£1.4m., most of which was allocated to the Press. The total for the same period of last year was Â£912,286. The Review says there has been an appreciable rise in the adver- tising of motor vehicles, particu- larly cars. Aggregate expenditure on cars in the first six months of this year was over Â£2.9m., of which more than Â£2.8m. was allocated to the Press. Press and TV advertising of household soaps and detergents was reduced in the last quarter, the total for which was a little over Â£2m. This is about 18 per cent: less than was spent in the comparable quarter of 1965. Itis of interest to note that since 1961 (when total expenditure was Â£10.2m.), Press and TV advertising of these products has decreased, the cress receiving the largest cuts in revenue from this source. In 1962 the. total was Â£9.6m., in 1963 Â£9.5m., in 1964 Â£9.7m., and in 1965 S9.4Am. The total for the fnst I half of this year is Â£4.m.

THE 14-MEMBER General Council \"of ilihe Scottish Trades Union Congress, at its meeting in Glasgow to-day, expressed \"serious concern\" about features of the present pattern of industrial events which are \"all too dismally reminiscent of the stop-go econo- mic picture of previous years.\" Mr. James Jack, the general secretary, in a statement issued after the meeting, said they had decided to invite trade union officials and shop ,stewards from Rootes, Linwood; BMC, Bathgate and ICI, Ardeer, to conferences which they plan to. hold within the next few weeks. Referring to the proposed early meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the Government's economic and fiscal measures.

But what does seem to a be clear is that what was beginning to look uncommonly like another i and potentially even more I dangerous threat to the pound has 1 now been contained-this time, I happily, before the 11th hour had i arrived. And there is a reasonable hope that the new breathing space the U.K. has in consequence been assured could last long enough to keep the parity safe while we are 1 waiting to see whether the Govern- ment's super special measures pro- I gramme is going to be more successful than the earlier versions. The pound was looking quite a i bit more cheerful in the inter- I national currency markets yester- < day. Its value in terms of the dollar for spot managed to climb a little beyond the $2.79 level- which is -a pleasant change. And discounts quoted against it for. forward delivery were showing a I tendency to contract But, bearing 1 in mind the powerful boost it I should have derived from the I simultaneous unveiling of a new , international support operation and 1 the relatively favourable trade a figures for August, the improve- ment was not all that marked, . World so bored Part of the explanation for this r is, no.doubt, to be found in the i fact th|t much of the rest of the I world Has become so bored with our marathon currency crisis that - it can no longer be induced to take f -a deep interest in its day-to-day a progress. But I would guess that r there is another and important one. a It is that the British official story r that the latest international sup- port operation has been arranged c -unlike earlier ones-from at \"position of strength\" has not N been as widely accepted abroad as ] might have been hoped and, indeed, a that there has been a tendency to t see its appearance on the scene as < denoting that the pound's troubles i have again been threatening to pose i a serious threat to the world's t financial peace. Such a show of scepticism could e hardly be regarded as a matter for 1, surprise. It is the case, after all, t that similarly reassuring state- ments were made by the British 1 authorities on the occasion of the f announcement of the last two central bankers' package deals in 1 September of 1965 and early June c this year. Yet in both cases it sub- sequently became evident that the r basic situation had been deteriorat- i ing to a sufficient extent to give sV cause for serious concern. In the lil three months preceding the Sep- is tember, 1965 operation, for in. re stance, the drain on reserves and su foreign credit facilities had been m runmng at an annual rate of ur around $5000m. th The international currency h( markets also had a more recent fe reason for wondering whether the th latest central bankers' exercise had be not arisen, as the earlier ones us appeared to have done, from ca something closely resembling a C British appeal for a rescue opera. ol tion. For it had become painfully ce evident during the past ten weeks m that even Mr. Wilson's super pro- vc gramme laced with the most categorical of categorical assur- ol ances of the Government's deter- cc mination to preserve the S2.80 th parity had failed to bring about sc the much needed revival of confi- fe dence in sterling, th bc U.S. position ra ni Certainly pressure on the pound in did fall off after the new correc- sh tives were announced in mid-July. th But there were indications that it ni had continued to be disconcertingly th heavy at times. And it had become sh evident that the situation could o0 take an alarming turn if the upward movement in money rates abroad provided a powerful new spur to the outflow of funds from London. fa An attempt has been made, it is a, true, to represent the latest sterling sj reinforcement operation as being m no more than a by-product of the ra U.S. decision to negotiate a massive o overhaul of its swap credits system -the U.K. naturally being due to , figure promiuently in such a re- arrangement as the holder of the most important of the credits out- n standing under existing arrange- t ments. It is not, of course, out of the th question that the U.S. did begin to i think in terms of such a new deal without any prodding from Britain. For it must have been painfully d& aware of late that its tendency hi to move from the defensive to the di offensive in the international w interest rates war could add a G great deal more fuel to this dan- pi gerous fire-and thereby expose i it to serious criticism if it failed to e) enlist the assistance of the other er leading countries in devising con- ei taining action. at It also has to be recognised, ec however, that the possibility of the B growth of hot money tensions pro- di duced by U.S. dearer money trends cc having particularly embarrassing bi consequences for sterling gave the th American authorities a very special p reason for. losing no .time in seek- st ing the approval -of their other di swap credit partners for a gneral liberalisation of the system. hus it is evident that, if the .S. has been reluctant to extend still further its support for sterling in recent months, it is not because it is itself unwilling to add to its lendings to this country. The big reason for holding back is to be found in the Fear that dollars made available to the U.K. on this account would- because they were quite likely to be used Subsequently for financing capital flows from Britain to the Continent-lead to a new build-up of dollars in the hands of other :entral banks and thereby add materially to American con- vertibility embarrassments. However, if the starting point of the latest international financial collaboration exercise was the fear that the sterling situation might soon begin to take on an explosive form again, it can at'least be said that this time the Wheels have been set in motion in' ood time rather than at a minute to mid- night. It can also be said that, inasmuch as the new ahrangements should greatly help to diupose of the side-effects of curreht :.inter- national hot-money flows as well as the direct consequences, the impact should be much more marked than on previous occasions. In the End Taken in conjunction with the fact that the outside world now appears to. be at least half-per- suaded that Britain's economy is '\" moving in the right directiont rather than the wrong one, this ought to mean that the pound really will be sailing in reasonably calm waters In the months ahead-this. even if changes in interest-rati. patterns continue to generate hot-- money frictions on interest ar\\i- trage account. It is even possible. that, before long, we shall see the start of a modest revival'of con-' Bdence in. the pound's future. However, whether or rot the' devaluation bogey ever raises its head again is clearly going. to. depend in the end on the extent to' which the new correctives the Government has adopted in the past few months are reflected it mnprovements in the imports- exports relationship. The exprtd., ence of the past two years has in- evitably created grave doubts.. abroad as to whether- general economic restraints 'can hold Britain's imports in check 'to the degree required to bring the country's payments back. into. balance and then into surplus at the speed required. And no permanent revival of confidnice in sterling 'can be expected until these doubts have been removed. -",

   "text_content" : "MR. WILSON seems to have saved the Commonwealth (although the angry Africans have not yet all had their say), but has he achieved anything else? Last night's interim com- muniqu6 on Rhodesia is a masterpiece of prose in which all disagreements are gently noted, a number of angry out- bursts are reduced to dulcet paragraphs, and a package of specific-looking British commit- ments are undetailed enough to leave the Prime Minister with a good. deal of room in which to manoeuvre. But in one import- ant sense the British Govern- ment comes out of the confer- ence less free than it was when it went into it. A time limit has been set. If Mr. Smith agrees to a deal before Christmas he can probably have it; if not, the communiqu6 implies, Britain will take its place at the head of the African nationalist ranks. Up to Mr. Smith Thus it is now up to Mr. Smith. For there is nothing in the .British position as outlined in last night's communiqu6 that excludes giving to Mr. Smith practically everything that was offered to him in the talks that concluded on the telephone on the morning of November 11, 1965, the day of the unilateral declaration of independence. This should be underlined. By the terms of the British pro- gramme of action as now an- nounced to the Commonwealth Mr. Smith has only to say the word and he would find himself heading a Rhodesian Front Government, with some of Britain's unfavourites excluded, but most of the present Cabinet . included. The Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, would be head of the administration, the Afri- can nationalists would be freed (on a promise of democratic be- haviour). sanctions would be lifted-and negotiations would begin where they left off on November 11, 1965. There is even the possibility, although the communique's words about world opinion circumscribe it somewhat, of choosing a form of consultation of the Rhodesian Africans (a Royal Commission; talking to party.leaders) that would avoid a black veto of any scheme agreeable to both Salisbury and London. And, for the foresee- able future, Rhodesia would still be a white man's country. South Africa's position It was just such an outlook that led Dr. Verwoerd to counsel strongly against UDI last year; it was the same prospect that led him to force Mr. Smith to agree to talks; it is the same con- ception that Mr. Wilson must now be hoping will lead Mr. Vorster to put similar pressure on Salisbury once more. For the alternative, with Mr. Vorster as it was with Dr. Verivoerd, might have been an open head-on clash with Britain, and that neither side has ever been able to contemplate with equanimity. What Mr. Wilson has now done is to conjure up the ghost of such a clash for after Christ- mas, no doubt arguing that the South Africans will say \"why have it when the white Rho- desians can get all they desire without it.\" But this is a game that Mr. Smith refused to play last year (hence UDI), and the chances are that his reaction to the ultimatum this year will be just as negative. Daunting proposition If that is the way the dice fall Mr. Wilson will find himself eyeball to eyeball with a far more daunting proposition than Mr. Smith-Mr. Vorster. When those two stare one another out the first one to blink will be the loser.

But the com* pany claims that this is incom. mi patiblo with otilcient mnnage.- ment, and the Government's i attitude was clearly set out by un the Prime Minister only a few thi days ago in his address to the pu Trades Union Congress. \"It is e of paramount importance,\" he mi said, \"however harsh this may pa seem, that where demand and thi real employment fall, the labour an in released to meet the urgent co demands of the export and other no key Industries.

Government attitude The fact that the men dis. misned will tend to be those qualilying for the smallest re- dundancy payments must stiffen union opposition and underlines the Government's mistake In putting the redundancy scheme before wage-related unemploy- mont benent, The mistake was partially rectified last sptlng in the new National Innuranc~ Act, and wage.related benofits be. come payable, conveniently, next month. The trouble is that, because of the decision to make sickness benefit waguorulated and the need to discouragI malipgering, the unemployment benefit is both too small and too constricted, Experience dur. ing the next few monthn will show where the existing scheme Smost needs to be improved.

   "text_content" : "W HEN the July measures pi were announced, the I marketing experts inside si the motor industry quickly gi reached a consensus on their ne likely impact during the last five months of 1966: a drop in sales u of about 6 per cent. from the 0 1965 level. This estimate still r holds. Sales in August were 81 down, according to preliminary o estimates-a natural reaction o from the beat-the-crisis rush in i July. September sales, on the other hand, are back near the i 1966 level, and several individual t manufacturers report that business is not as bad as they 4 expected, though reports from retailers, reflecting second-hand as well as new sales, are much less encouraging. This sounds quite a cheerful - state of affairs: btt the closing months of 1965 were pretty bad themselves. Up to July last year, 789,000 new cars were registered, a monthly average of c nearly 113,000. In the rest of the year 335,000 cars were I registered: the average of 65,000 1 monthly represented a drop of t more than 42 per cent. from the 9 early part of the year. This t would have caused alarms last v year, but for the fact that the I industry was confidently stock- a piling for a good first half of' he 1966-the peak in sales in the anc first hal of each year has been a I getting steadily more pro- but nounced for some years. mo The early months of 1966 lived to up to expectations. By the end 19I of July new registrations had ca reached an all-time record of the 809,000-a monthly average of beg over 115,500. Tb- predicted drop tur of 6 per cent. would give 315,000 loo in the last five months of the tloi year, or 63,000 monthly. So on the the \"optimistic\" assumption, be the industry was expecting the I1 sales rate to drop by more than to 45 per cent, from the level earlie tiv this year. Only heroic stock- wo red Letters appear on Page 8 sac the piling or exports could keep pro- foi duction going five days a week, Bu even at a slow rate and without arn overtime. 191 The outlook for the early months of 1967 does not justify sal heroic stock-piling by the indus- she try in general. Apart from the see effect of the July measures in col themselves, expectation will be tw working in reverse next year. res In 1965 and 1966 the public had lei good reasons to fear what might nu rappen in' the Budgpt or the naual summer 'oraisl-thise had i. good deal to do with the unching,, ofales in the early nonth, o ekh year, ,sperily o .compty,'r t buyers. By 1967,, it7 kt' e hoped, there :a ibotothing iorse to fear: if he bilaace of pymaete Â·i eginning to lookhalthy btthe urn of the year, biYn v I be ookiog forward to aif'ejlaxW ion. -So the expecasop s that bhe two halves of the year will be much better bala'..d. This prospect of.' a i hAs end to this year, 'followed by rela- tively steady sales through 1967, would of itself' justify some redundancies, and may be one Factor influencing BMC. And from the profit point of view there, is a good deal to be said for a less peaky pattern of sales. But what, apart from the peaks, ye are total sales likely to be in kn 1967? ho The factors influencing car lev sales are very complex but, as is mc shown by the diagram, there Na seems to have been a very strong an correlation in recent years be- tot tween the rates \"f increase in inc real consumer spending and the level of car sales relative to the dit number of cars in use. For this pr s l < e The factorts influencing carle seem two halve been a very strong an correlation in recent years be- toa tween the rates 4 increae in i real consumer spending ndth level of ca sales rielati to the di number of cars in, use. So at is pt \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ear, when most of the facts are aown, the correlation seems to old: the diagram shows the ;vel of real consumption as lost recently predicted by the lational Institute of Economic nd Social Research and the >tal car sales estimated by the idustry's own forecasters. For 1967, as can be seen, con- itions will be much more de- ressed. The NIESR predicts a In se< rise in consumption of only ap 0.6 per cent., and even this is 20 generally regarded as too opti- of mistic.. This would suggest that ye car sales in 1967 will, on past th relationships, amount to only 19 about 10.9 per cent. of the cur- be rent car population. This popu- th lation stood at 8.9m. in 1965, a in rise of 670,000 over 1964. Allow- ar ing for a higher rate of scrap- tu ping, due partly to lower second- g( band prices, the rise this year seems likely to be rather less. despite the virtually unchanged level of sales over the two years as a whole, giving a total of about 9.5m. at this year's census. This suggests new registrations of about 1,040.000 in 1967, com- pared with the 1,124,000 pre- dicted for this year and actually realised in 1965. This figure represents a drop of 71 per cent. for 1967 as a whole: if the situation develops even marginally worse than the NIESR has predicted, the drop might well be 10 per cent. But given the more even distribution of sales, this is likely to look much worse in the early months of the year. A split of say 55:45 between the two halves of the year, which seems quite on the cards, would appear as a drop of more than 20 per cent. in the early months of 1967. The second half of the year, on the other hand, would then be 121 per cent. better than 1966, and indeed 71 per cent. better than 1965. Unfortunately the drop of 20 per cent or so in the early part of the year now appears pretty certain; the later turn-round is in the lap of the gods and the NIESR.",

   "text_content" : "THE OFFICIAL commercial vehicle statistics are misleading. In the figures, a Mini-van counts for as much as a 30-ton truck: in value, the truck may be worth ten times as much. So the totals which are usually published con- ceal the real growth of the industry. The progress in trucks can quite simply be seen by eliminating the light vans from the total: the result is shown in the table. For the industry as a whole, the monthly value of output provides another check. From 1963 to 1965 this rose from Â£24.3m. to Â£28.5m. For the first half of this year the figure was Â£31.lm.-a rise of more than 4 per cent. over the same period last year. In eynnrlts ton- the record is encouraging. The industry is J the biggest truck exporter in the 1 world. Recently it has actually been able to increase its market share, comfortable over 30 per t cent., and its lead over Ger- i many, in second place. The swift growth of Japanese com- petition (already hitting one or two individual products, such as the Land-Rover) is the only 1 substantial threat. i The figures for total exports, j which show little change since 1964, are again deceptive. Over 1 the two years shipments of 4 cheap light vans have dropped i by more than a fifth, and medium-weight trucks are about i level (though with a growing i bias to the heavier weights). But 1 trucks over ten tons are up by i 6 per cent., recovering from a i slight setback last year, and bus i shipments, at over 7,000 up to 1 July, are 56 per cent. above the 1964 level. This record abroad looks safe at the moment. The industry is still expanding fast. Ford has led this year, with a 40 per cent. rise in exports as the new range has gone into volume production. Bedford, normally the biggest maker and exporter, has lost about 15 per cent. of normal production reorganising for the new, bigger trucks and engines just announced, but should have a good year in 1967. Chrysler- Rootes is also raising production of its big Dodge models and working flat out. At the heavy end, the improve- ment could well accelerate. The new Construction and Use regu- lations have created a U.K. market for the big 30-ton trucks in common use in Europe. The immediate home demand has been so overwhelming that a number of foreign builders are following the lead of Mercedes- Benz and Magirus Deutz into the British market: DAS from Hol. res TRUCK AND BUS an PRODUCTION b Monthly averages an 195 ..................... 12,2 en 1959 ................. 15,4S55 1960 .................. 19,732 1961 ................. 17,788 1962 ............... 16,761 1963 ................. 24,527 1964 .................. 2,65 na 1965 ............... 27,697 b 1966 (1st half) ...... 30,373 so re * Over 15 cwt capacity. ti $ Over 1I tons gross vehicle weight, sti Sin Mnd Hino from Japan have th anounced their arrival, and Fiat fe vill be exploring at the Com- ot nercial Vehicle Show next week. it But the British industry is now be 'esponding quickly.

The th lepression in cars may well ease vi ,ottlenecks in other components. I: In the home market there is Jt laturally rather less confidence, 2; ut again the heavy end looks di ;ecure. .The impact of the new tc regulations and of the much a ighter policing of safety are c< itrong incentives to replace age- vi ng vehicles: experience of past oi .conomic setbacks also shows that the truck market usually feels the effect much later than 3ther industries, especially when it has long order books at the beginning of the slump. Medium-weight trucks, whose production was about 4 per cent. off in the first half of the year despite a slightly higher level of exports, look less secure, but any fall should be moderate if the improvement in exports can be kept up. With a number of new or improved models on offer, this looks achievable. Only light vans, where production was off 121 per cent. even before the July crisis, and exports were 23 per cent. belowvthe 1965 level, does a depression comparable to that in cars seem probable- a grim prospect for those mainly concerned, since many of these vans are car derivatives or made on car production* lines.",

They will point out that when the National Union of Railwaymen called off its national rail strike last February one of its conditions was that railwaymen's pay should be increased by 3% per cent. this month. Althpugh Mr. Wilson is certain to tell'the railwaymen's leaders that they must wait until March for the '3% per, pt. increase, the NURlis not expted to resume its threat of a nationalstrike. However, the union is holding a special con. ference at Manchester next week- end for its signalment members, who are agitating for bonus pay- ments. The conference will dis- cuss motions from two branches proposing a strike on this issue. SAttitude to Freeze The day before the Prime Minister's meeting with the rail unions the NUR's leadership will be reconsidering its attitude to the pay freeze and the Prices and Incomes Act. The main purpose of this meeting will be to decide how the. NUR should cast its 200.000 votes in the economic debate at the Labour Party's annual confer- once in three weeks' time. The NUR voted in favour of the freeze at the Trades Union Congress last week because the union's annual conference last July had rejected a motion opposing any legislation which restricted pay negotiations. But because this decision was taken by the NUR YORK, Sept. 14. attended the conference will re assemble next Wednesday to re consider the union's economic policy. Other Bodies Other rail unions attending the meeting with the Prime Ministet will be the Associated Society of Locomotive, Engineers and Fire men. the Transport Salaried Staffs 'ssociation and (representing rail way workshopmen) the Confedera ion of Shipbuilding and Enginee. na Unions. ,The NUR and the CSEU ar also asking for a meeting with Mrs. Batabaa Castle, Minister of Trans.",

The effectiveness of an Slema advertisement, for instance, iS s are very difficult to quantify. The technical skills of the O.R. man (and the data-processing abilities of the computer) have out- stripped the quality of the data that are available; there is a temptation to build elegant models on data which are no more than assumptions. Never- theless, some useful work- has been done in applying O.R. to media planning. The quality of the O.R. efforts now going on in this country is at least as high as in the United States; it is cer- tainly not a field in which Britain lags behind the rest of the world. But an O.R. team can only be effective in a company if the top management is con- vinced of the value of their work. The O.R. man himself is in necessarily a staff adviser, free es, from the day-to-day responsi- ial bilities of the line manager; nd although some people have made a successful transition ial from O.R. into line manage- rat ment, it is not common. ral ad Wider Implication ing the What is vital is that the managers at the top should have the capacity to look at problems in the same analytical, iggins scientific way as the O.R. man paper himself. In one sense O.R. is ch is a management tool, like work to. study, designed to solve specific Ipany problems, but in another it ware- represents an approach to stem; management problems which taken has much wider implications.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF The. seamen's strike has hit P. andO. to the tune of Â£1.4m. and :1965.66. profits will be \"materially lower,\" but it is hoped;to hqol the 10 ..per cent. dividend (see Lex Page 1). Lower ,profts \"at the halfway mark Aare aliao reported by GeneaWS' R.trctorie and Timothy Whrit (see Lex) and the results of Anmstro Equip. meat bpar out only too well the earlierirnian with dividend Mhalve. But close company i statusi ables Fox's Biscuits to rmatWh good resultswith a higher dividd'.i and Spark Holdings 'has ,roduced, record profits.. Anote~ii acquisition is an- !nounced by Carrington and Dewburat Spark Holdings As forecast, the 1965-66 results from Spark Holdings are a record with '. retiax profits up from Â£591,000 toÂ£693,000. The dividend is 45 per cent., as before, covered 1 Y2 times by earnings of 68.7 per cent.; but cover drops to 1.3 times if the Defbrred capital-convertible at 12 months' notice-is included. The impetus came from engin- eering, fully recovered from the disruption caused by two factory moves, which pushed up its profits Â£100,000 to Â£350,000, about half of the gioup total; and also from the .printing section-Â£103,000 against Â£19,000-where investment in new plant and machinery really paid off. But textiles, which made the running in 1964-65, fell back from Â£138,000 to Â£90,000. while timbier mrchanting had to contend with *he import surcharge and nar- rowing margins, bringing profits down .Â£30.000 to Â£82,000. The current-year looks to be following a similar, pattern. Both engineer- ing and prninin are still doing well and should agan easily counteract any further fall on the textile and merchantin side. And the aboli- tion f' t hl mport surcharge could help timbet later on. At 9s 9d- up 4d onl'thq day-the 2s shares yield 9.5 per cent. and are telling at 7.9 times earnings on the full capital. Frayn Group There, Ji no reason for general optimism about profits in the building: sector, but individual exceptions do still exist. The Fram Group, for example, seems to fit into tis special category with pre- tax nicifti in the .year to April last up by 12% per cent to Â£272,000-struck after a Â£57,000 higher depeciaJtlon charge. All sections of Vfie (roup did reason- ably well includng civil engineer- ing and pre-cast concrete, but industrialised building is becoming Increasingly important. Last year this section made a respectable contribution to profits and since there is apparently no difficulty in finding new large contracts, the outlook Is bright. At present the general order position is substantially better and margins are still realistic-which should mean a modest increase in profits this year. In the longer term there is clearly plenty of scope for factory made housing units and the group is equipped to cope with demand. Moreover, the Â£600,000 debenture issue last February has eased liquidity and the 15 per cent dividend is covered 1.6 times- admittedly not after a full 40 per cent tax charge. Applying the full rate leaves the shares on a very reasonable 11 times PIE ratio with the shares at 4s 7%d, and a 6.7 per cent yield takes care of uncertainties. Fox's Biscuits Ironic it may be, but close com- pany stains seems to offer at least one positive advantage at the moment. It allows Fox's Bbeuts, for example, to lift the dividend from 17% to 21% per cent. which took the shares up by Is yesterday and the yield to 5.8 per cent. at 18s ?d. The dividend is still twice covered, btut cpitJl spieding, for the independents, is the only way to kepe alopt In an. intustry domi- nated by liansm; Fox's tie-up with Marks and Spencer rates highly as a reason why profits are up from Â£195,000 to Â£221,000-biscuit pro- duction as a whole has been more or less static for the past year or so. It also allows the group to think about further expansion in sales, which reads well with a P/E ratio of 8.6 times. Edwards Vacuum The bid for Edwarda High Vacuum of l s a share, frustrated by the Edwards' senior executive staff, has been made to look all the bettei since for the way the share price has dipped to 8s. Nor will the half-year profits do any- thing to reverse the view. They have dropped sharply in the ix months .ended June to Â£149,000 against Â£228,000 a year earlier. It is true there is a forecast of better things in the second half, when profits are expected to move up to Â£180,000. However, this will merely produce a surplus for the year of Â£329,000. efore tax against Â£350,000. At 8s the price/earnings ratio is 24 times and all that underlines is the generosity of the Varian approach. Armstrong Equipment Increased costs, fixed selling prices and motor industry strikes all darkened the interim report from Armstrong Equipment last March but in this case the event is much- worse than anticipated. Profits have slumped from Â£333,000 to Â£122,000, before tax, and earn- ings of just 6.8 per cent. emerge for the dividend, which is halved from 20 to 10 per cent. At 2s 6d, down 6%d on the day, the shares are only a shadow of what they used to be. But it re- mains to be seen whether this is the limit of Armstrong's downside potential. After all, an uncovered yield of 8.1 per cent. can hardly he called generous for a motor industry supplier, just as its custo- mers are serving out redundancies piecemeal. In addition to shock absorbers, Armstrong makes hydraulic equipment and fasten- ing products for a wide range of customers. In March it implied that \"interesting\" new contracts could reverie the decline in profits in 1966-67. If this still applies, the sooner the report comes out the better.",

   "text_content" : "TWINS FleFinall Time Reporter A .new insurance policy intro- duced at Lloyd's yesterday provides Scover for. ouples expecting a child if there are twins or other multiple births, combined with temporary life assurance on the life of the mother (and father if required) for any period up t? five years. The cover for the expectant mother ,will. include the risk of death during pregnancy or child- birth. Under the multiple birth section of ,,thf golicy a single payment can be arranged, or there is the option of a payment on the birth and further pay- ments of a quarter of the sum speci- fled every three months for five or ten years. The cover is available in units of Â£100 cash and Â£25 quarterly for 20 or 40 payments. There are higher benefits for triplets or quads. As is customary, both children must survive for 24 hours and no claim will be paid in the event of a birth being more than six weeks premature. No insurance of multiple births will be accepted within four months of the expectant date. Benefits Premiums depend on age, health and family history but, as an example, for a couple aged 35 and 33. with one child already, a premium of Â£25 could secure cover of Â£200 for twins and .20 quarterly, instalments of Â£50, plus two years' cover for Â£1,000 on the lives 6f both husband and wife. The part of the premium applicable to the life risk is eligible for income-tax relief within the normal limits. The Lloyd's syndicate introducing the policy believes that this is the first time that any insurer has set out specifically to insure pregnant women for life insurance, covering the risk of death including by pregnancy and childbirth. As a separate contract the same syndicate is already offering a standard policy covering congemtal malformities at birth-such as total blindness cerebral diplegia (spastic). Siamese twins and Hare lip. HI-WAY STAGING The aircraft division of Martin Thomas has received a Â£30,000 order from the British Aircraft Cor- poration to supply Hi-Way staging fCa tha wndneftine flin ennA \"uppor~ed stNatetiis th a t~ This Is stated In a s5qp< p programme, prepared by efenceat th of Senator Stuart Symington, ad o ith.Con*resoz is d e y ir it if I. e a I- is it n Is ir kr it n he id ie h ,t Id Id 5s re Ix ag st Id at r- 18 Record of September 8. It is no Dynamics, builder of the aircraft, The document compriset a long point-by-point analysis of all the criticisms of the F-ll1 programme originally contained in the August 15 issue of \"Barron's,\" the U.S. financial journal, which touched off a spate of criticism of the F-ll both in the U.S. and the U.K. It is claimed that the production of the F-llIA is on schedule; in essential respects, its performance will be close to the evaluations made during the 1962 design com- petition; in the critical factors of range, payload, speed and versati- lity, it will be superior in its class to any other tactical weapon system in the world; and that the cost experience to date has compared favourably with that of other large- scale development programmes. -Cost Estimates \"It is true that the present esti- mate exceeds the estimate made in 1962 by the Air Force,\" says the Report, but it is pointed out that even that estimate was never offici- ally accepted by Mr. McNamara. Experience of the research, deve- lopment and evaluation programme was necessary before anyone could have a firm fix on per aircraft costs. \"With this experience the costs for the basic airplane are now at the point that permits the production con- tract to be in the late stages of negotiation. \"We expect that when a definitised production contract is signed the price of the aircraft will be close to these more realistic estimates.\" Allegations that the F-11l will re. quire more maintenance than compar. able aircraft \"is a prime example of a misleading conclusion based on false premises.\" It is pointed out that the F-105 and F.4C aircraft have maintenance times per flying hour of 40 .hours and 38 hours respectively, against the F-11t's 35 hours. Not Overweight The claim that the U.S. Navy's carriers will not be able to take an aircraft over 70,000 lbs weight is refuted. \"The fact is that the eleva- tors of the Midway, Forrestal, and. later classes of attack carriers which will be in the fleet at the time the Cr b thadti thirdmndel of tb S-.$ Boy ~ by 12, feet t ra h ihloimum specified heilhte 60,0 feet are said to b e adi and incorrect. \"In the Airst place, n such flight has even been scheduled c Sattempted with any F-1118 at thi stage of the programme.

Paper-makers in Scandinavia and North America enjoy an important cost advantage, because their huge forest resources enable them to produce pulp and paper in large-scale, integrated opera- tions. Most British paper mills de- pend on imported pulp, which has to be dried before shipment, transported to Britain, and re- constituted again at the mills. This process affects adversely both the cost of production and the quality of the paper. As long as the British paper industry was protected by high tariffs, this basic inequality in costs could be tolerated. But the EFTA agreement, bitterly re- sisted by the paper-makers, has meant that tariffs on Scandi- navian papers have been pro- gressively lowered; at the end I ICIIIL in- of this year they will disappear sp 1 at completely. tri the The British industry has been du art orced to find a way of sur- of rt viving in these new conditions dil try, of free trade. The actions that of r a have been taken in the last few nc om- years, including the more de- va kers termined exploitation of home- ex )rth grown timber, may not prevent oti tant imports from gradually in- tal air creasing their share of the U.K. no heir market, but they should ensure m4 tble the continued existence of a per sizeable and reasonably pros- B era- perous paper industry in this Br country. th de- mc ent, Newsprint Economics th re- It is in the mass-produced ha ills. grades, such as newsprint and du ;ely sack kraft, that the natural Br ind advantage of the big integrated tel producers is most important. Cc per The economics of a' newsprint coi ligh mill depend on size and on near- Br in ness to large forests, providing Ca But a constant source of wood to ma re- be ground into pulp and con- tra has verted into paper in one con- pr< idi- tinuous operation .co! iro- The natural advantage is wh ,nd least important in the case of im] ir specialised grades, such as tracing paper, which are pro- I :n duced in smaller quantities and r r- often require a blend of several i is different pulps; for this sort of c at operation the flexibility of a I w non-integrated mill can be I e- valuable. Between these two a e- extremes there are a host of c It other grades where the advan- \"* tages of an integrated versus a c Snon-integrated operation are r e more evenly balanced. r a The obvious reaction of the - British paper makers to import a competition has been to shift v their production away from the e mass-produced grades towards P the more specialised end of the n spectrum. Reed, for instance, 1 d has decided to transfer its pro- d duction of sack kraft from its iI British mills to its new in- d tegrated operations in British t. Columbia; when the shift is it completed, it will supply its tl - British customers with c g Canadian-made sack kraft. The tc a machines made idle by this a i- transfer have been adapted to o i- produce other grades, such as f( coated papers for magazines. w s which are less vulnerable to ia f import competition. di The position of newsprint is cc not quite the same, since the f( newspaper publishers are prob- gl ably not prepared to rely di exclusively on imported supplies. in At present British mills, chiefly te Bowater and Reed, supply as about half their needs; the rest us comes from ' Canada and i Scandinavia. While the share th of imports will almost certainly es rise, there will be no drastic oi run-down in U.K. production. m Much will depend on the avail- lo ability of home-grown timber, which would improve the ca economics of British newsprint til production; Bowater's Elles- m mere Port mill is fed partly on locally grown wood. n ar of Large Investment be su There is, of course, a limit to be the extent to which machines in can be switched from one grade us to another; very large invest- ments are often needed. More- te over, there are large parts of, to for instance, the \"printings and as writings\" market m which the gr Integrated Scandinavian pro-th ducers do have a considerabl ke is cost advantage. Scholastic paper wher he for exercise books is the kind of Jute b- grade which needs to be pro- indu! ly duced in large volume and in an whic ,s. integrated mill. There is also a expe ly tendency for specialised grades, more ly as they become more widely impo st used, to move into the \"com- id modity\" class. So throughout re the industry there are intense ly efforts to become less dependent Bu ic on imported raw materials and to b n. make fuller use of whatever pulp il- local resources are available. mark :r, These resources fall into two coml ie categories-waste paper and Boar nt timber. Waste paper is the raw integ ,s- material for certain types of at i on packaging board, and the big whicl board producers, such as Reed Scanm and Thames Board Mills (part due of the Unilever group), have 1967. been active in increasing the too supply of waste paper (through Toba to better collection services) and anno es in developing new ways of a pu le using it. the t 1t- The import surcharge has indus e- tended to encourage board'users waste f, to buy waste-based grades, such trees id as jute liner, instead of imported impo ie grades, such as kraft liner, and Th >- the board producers 'expect to timbe Ie keep a good deal of this botiness has when the surcharge comes off. de\\ Jute liner for the case-making ES industry is one of the grades mil which Reed is expanding at the the expense of grades which are the more obviously vulnerable to cot import competition. in Bo' lish Quality Boards po, *But high-quality boards have bas to be made wholly or partly of Bui pulp, and a good deal of this plo market is vulnerable to import tiol competition. Hence, Thames agr Board Mills is building an a s integrated pulp and board mill 1 at Workington in Cumberland adc which will be able to match fou Scandinavian costs; this mill is cor due for completion early in larl 1967. St. Anne's Board Mill, che too (part of the Imperial Wil Tobacco group), recently prc announced its intention to build put a pulp mill at Bristol. Thus Tw the board-making sector of the obt industry is looking both to imf waste paper and to home-grown froi trees as aids in meeting the We import challenge, out The use .of, home-produced yea timber by the paper industry; wil has not, of course, suddenly Fin ....-- ,- developed as a result of the pulp EFTA agreement. Several pulp for tl mills had been built well before The the agreement had even been be ex thought of. Wiggins Teape come completed its Sudbrook mill as lai in Monmouthshire in 1958. as th Bowater has two long-estab- can lished pulp mills, at Ellesmere futur, Port and at Kemsley, which are ensur based partly on local timber. and But these were, in some degree, possil pioneering ventures. The reduc- the tion of duties under the EFTA timbe agreement has undoubtedly been mills. a great stimulus. to fc The position now is that, in pulp I addition to the three older mills, the sa four new ones are built, under adopt construction or planned. The forest largest is Wiggins Teape's and chemical pulp mill at Fort William, which is already in production with an initial out. put of 100,000 tons a year. Two-thirds of the wood is Thi obtained locally; the rest is ing tl imported in the form of chips down from Canada. Thames' mill at it to t Workington will have an initial here output of 25,000-30,000 tons a bearij year; St. Anne's mill at Bristol abilit will start at about 15,000 tons. ports Finally, another groutidwood pulp-i pulp mill is under consideration for the Aberdeen area. These seven mills, which will be expanded as more wood be- comes available, constitute about as large a pulp-making industry as the country's forest resources can sustain in the foreseeable future. A vital need now is to ensure that the wood is extracted and exploited as efficiently as possible. This involves not just the paper industry, but other timber users, notably the saw mills. The integrated approach to forest utilisation, with the pulp mills using the offcuts from the saw mills, must eventually be adopted here, as it is in the-great forest areas of North America and Scandinavia. Reducing Costs There is great scope for reduc- ing the costs involved in cutting down the tree .and transporting it to the mills. An improvement here will have an important bearing on the papermakers' ability to compete against inx. ports and on the growth of tho pulp-making industy.",

   "text_content" : "By J. L. DAVIDSON ,1 FORESTRY COMMISSION .Th apen, of Scottish pulp we and' perells at Annat, near' th Fort William, is an event of great importance not only to pl; Wiggins Teape and Co. and to to industrial development in Scot- m land, but to the successful pro- ha gress of afforestation in the ye Highlands. is The tradition of forestry in ti< the Highlands is a long one, and th there is reason to be grateful to 15 those early tree planters who ti< sensed the leading role of th forestry in the exploitation of r! the limited natural resources of pl the region, and whose prudence P1 was to make a contribution of P.* immense value towards the coun- sJ try's needs. in two world wars. m For long enough their efforts re- ceived little official encourage- ment. But in the end they won recognition of their beliefs and the establishment of a firm national policy for forestry, to which the 400,000 acres of new forests established by the Forestry Commission and di 200,000 acres of well managed fc private woodlands in the High- ll lands bear witness. ft Forestry's Role N c1 With the growth of experience ti, and technical .understanding of oj the problems has come a fuller be appreciation of the importance th of the forest industry to the eco- tii nomic and social well-being of w the region. As the recent White fr Paper on the Scottish Economy a] put it: \"The Government fully r recognise the importance of th afforestation in providing em- 1! ployment opportunities in the a rural areas and in providing the r( raw material for a home-based cV timber-using industry. In the til Highlands forestry offers the best prospects of providing the necessary industrial core to the economy.\" tl To put matters in perspective, s; the Highland area extends to 62 p per cent. of the land of Scotland al or 21 per cent. of Britain-18,600 ix square miles, of which only 940 ei square miles, or about 5 per b cent., are afforested. But on this A impoverished land forestry can n profitably employ eight men per v 1,000 acres in the woods when a ther seven. The irat yields of timber from plantations become available 15 to 20 years after their establish ment, and the final harvest may have.to wait for a further 40 years or more. Current output is therefore derived from plan*t. tions created before the end of the last war, and expansion upto 1980 must be based on plant&. tions already established, but in this period output is expected to rise rapidly as the large post-war plantations are recruited to the productive ages. Forecast out- put from the Forestry Commis- sion's Highland forests is esti- mated as: Output (m. hoppus ft.) 1965 .......... 6.0 1970 .......... 10.6 1975 .......... 13.7 1980 .......... 19.5 1985 .......... 27.5 No precise estimate of pro- duction from privately owned forests is available but it seems likely to rise from 6.5m. hoppus ft. in 1965 to 8.4m. in 1980. (A hoppus foot is 1.273 cu. ft.). Much of the timber now being cut is from thinnings and is rela- tively small. About 80 per cent. of the Commission's output is below 8 inches in diameter. With the maturing of the older planta- tions the volume of larger wood will increase steadily, especially from 1975 onwards, but there are still larger areas of more recent plantations to come into the thinning stage, so that in 1980 there will still be 70 per cent. of the output in the small roundwood category and, of course, further planting con- tinues at an increasing pace. Eager Market For the larger diameter wood there is an eager market. The sawmilling iodustry has a large potential market for sawn wood and it is impatiently awaiting increased supplies of sawlogs to enable it to improve its efficiency by establishing larger sawmills. A closer integration of saw- milling and such industries as wood pulp and particle board able to use the by-products of Ssawmilling is also beginning to appear, but full rationalisation may have to wait for the ' peoted increase in raw material in perhaps 10 years' time. It is with th ncreasing quant ties of imas roundwood, tbeo fore, that the ain develoMi are currently taking plae .Scottish paijid traperM is an ishportnt factor. Tb. main traditional markt wood, has declined ply. the closure ad ' lit t the National Coal Board's Scot- tish pits, and this trend seems likely to continue. The English coalfields and English wood-processing sac- tories are far away and transport of a bulky raw material like wood is costly compared with its intrinsic value. The importance of the new pulp and paper mills in the Highlands, designed for future expansion as more wood becomes available, lies therefore in the long-term assurance of a market which it offers to growers. To make the project possible the Forestry Commission has contracted to meet three-quarters -T:'-C requiremeant o 8. \\tpps ft a year of conifer i A wobod, and by so doing has op'eed new prospects for the .privM. grower. Deliveries of wood started in the summer of 1965 and to date total over 34m. hoppus ft, but the rate is being built up monthly, and produc- tion of pulpwood is in progress at forests throughout the High. lands area as far as Banff in the .eat, Perth and the Firth of Clyde in the south. In. planning the supply of pulpwood it was seen that the entirely new circumstances pre- sented a unique opportunity for re-examination of wood hand- ling methods. Studies, conducted jointly by Scottish Pulp and the Forestry Commission, were aimed at ontimum efficiencv i'uo pupVwoUuM M a McOU3 101 i from stump to chip pile and in- r. celuding road, rail and sea trans. as port.

   "text_content" : "By LORD CLYDESMUIR CHAIRMAN, THE SCOTTISH COUNCIL, DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRY Undoubtedly the most signi- ficant effect of the arrival of the new pulp mill at Fort William is that, for the first time in 250 years, the Highlands are being populated rather than depopu- lated. In the shadow of Ben Nevis new houses are being built, new roads being con- structed and plans are emerging for greatly improved amenities to cope with the influx of popu- lation. And behind all the acti- vity there is a new feeling of confidence that contrasts with the traditional Highland air of resignation. The renaissance of an area such as the Highlands, compris- -_ . a__t TP _ \"ig as it aoes nan or Scouana and one sixth of the British Isles, is something that cannot be achieved overnight. Already, however, there are signs that a region which has had its life- blood slowly drained away over many years is coming to life again. And the whole of Scot. land-indeed, the whole of Bri. tain-will be the richer for it. For centuries life in the North has been hard. The farms- mostly small in size-are not prosperous. The great sporting estates take up huge areas of ground and offer shooting and fishing as fine as any in the world, but they provide little work. The industrial develop. ment that has taken place, ranging from whisky distilling and light engineering to glass blowing and postcard printing, has not kept pace with the need for work. Even the large programme to provide hydro-electric power, which has cost Â£185m, and employs 3,000 people over an area of 22,000 square miles, has not stemmed the flow of families to the south. The excellent efforts of the Hydro-Electric Board show, however, what can be achieved through making use of natural resources. The hydro. electric power stations depend on one of the Highlands' greatest resources-water-and therein lies their strength. Natural Resource Now the pulp mill has come to make use of another natural resource-trees. True, man had to nurture this resource and develop it carefully, Since 1945 no other area of Britain has been so thoroughly planted with spruce and pin, and for 15 years, while the first saplings were reaching maturity, various organisations, led by the Scot- tish Council, sought to encour- age the British paper-making - -~~--~ ---- rYIIIIRIIHlllllrJIII1111#11111111111111 IIRIIIIIWUllllllllmIHHlllllmlllllllllll indu this Wig ahea not but; whic tree! reqt plan cove Inve mar Spe: T 2,00 widi emp into For ther scht doci in I coly N the gair The woi exp witl the 3,0( whi wh< inc: for Naturally, Fort William, witU ife the mill close beside it, stands to ot. gain the most immediate benefit.

BROCKMANt, Ot Architectural Correspondent Teh thousand home-grow trees are converted every da into sheets of fidl letter pape in this great mill; from tree trunk to thin white sheet alon half a niie of processing- an machinery. Architectural and civil eng nearing problems of accom modating this project into th landscape and of ensuring it functional progression have beei impressively solved with broa< strokes of the design brush. Th result is satisfying in scale an both satisfying and amazing is order and purpose. The mill stands on the shore of Loch Eil with mountains all round. It is shielded fron the town of Fort William by a forest bluff which pokes into the acute angle of water between its own loch and Loch Linnhe; a confluence at the western ex tremity of the Caledonian Canal Ben Nevis, with a fringe ol cloud falling across its dark fore head, looks down on the twc great arms of water, one ol which reflects the town and the other the mill and its attendant jetties and housing. The moun tain frame is grand and beautiful Loch Eil's Shores Industrial architecture offers beyond any other a design prob lem which depends upon func tion. It cannot reasonably impose towers where towers are not needed, neither can it lie low and snug where water heads, boilers and smoke stacks demand height. At Fort William func- tion has dictated the mass and the progression in plan and lay- out; in the indivisible result, civil engineering has ordered it and architecture has clothed it. The mill presents a long range of relatively low buildings of varying height on bold plinths of black brick; the mass rears up near the centre to a 170 foot high rectangular power house. Eleva- tional treatment of the power house, and principal mill build- ings sets the key to the whole. They are clothed in large verti- cally ribbed full-height panels of grey aluqlipluum with bold white trim, the windows making long dark vertical slits between them. At either end of this central theme lie the offices and separate canteen buildings to the east and the long low finishing and despatch range to the west; a battleship silhouette reflected in the loch. The power house is framed in steel and the crowning fascia is of white aluminium.

Moreoiver these vessels are necessarily subjected to severe mechanical wear, impact and, in some instances, thermal shock. It is interesting to note that in these days of innovation in the ap- proach to vessel linings, that ceramics constructed in chemical re- sistant cements were selected as the best all round medium. This Company in conjunction with a Swedish company were in- strumental in the design and construction of these linings. All of the ceramics and a proportion of the cementswere obtained from Sweden through Langley London Limited, the sole agents and distributors in the United Kingdom. We would like to pay tribute to the high standard of administration operated by that Company for making this a very efficient operation. The entire construction was executed in thirteen months, using eight hundred tons of ceramics and chemical resistant cements, by our own Contracts Division, with Scottish labour and site admini- stration throughout.

Such an opportunity occurred at Scottish Pulp id Paper Mills and the challegn was to; incorporate safety at every stage of the con- structional and civil engineering work, the installation and com- missioning of a large amount of machinery and plant, and the putting to work of a group of operatives in entirely new sure roundings. Good Record It was essential that co-opera- tion in safety between the main contractors, sub-contractors, pon. suiting engineers and the mills' own personnel was carried out in such a way that progress was not impeded but advanced. A method of work was agreed to control every conceivable dan- gerous habit and action, includ- ing site cleanliness and orderli- ness. Absence of fatal accidents and near freedom from serious injuries were a measure of the success of that organisation. But plant and machinery are the tools of process work which remain long after the installation is complete and so design and controls involve considerations II Logo from Scotdiub forest ar unloaded. of safetv.

Each unit of the production machinery was considered at the design stage so that every potential hazard due to its design and subsequent use was taken care of by designing the guard- ing systems at the same time as the machinery. The suppliers and makers of all the machinery knew the requirements for safe working at the same time as the requirements of production. Throughout the design stage there were frequent consultations between the suppliers and the staff to ensure that decisions took into account safety, not only to statutory requirements but to the ultimate end that worker safety was given the highest priority. Lest details had been overlooked, during installa- tion and commissioning there was constant vigilance to ensure that plant and machinery were to the standard expected and to pick up those conditions which had not been foreseen. At any time on a site under construction, the risk of fire is ignh. Tere is a contnuous use of equipment such as welding apparatus and tar-boilers and much electrical equipment, all of which improperly or carelessly used would lead to destruction of the plant and buildings. Throughout the project the removal of debris, often the ready fuel of industrial fires, was given a high priority. Fire- fighting appliances under the control of trained men were available and always serviceable. Stand-by Firemen Recognition of Scottish Pulp firemen was given by the local fire authority when they asked them to stand-by on occasion to deal with outbreaks outside the site. The special problem of workers living in wooden quarters, which for room heat- ing depended upon convector- type electrical heaters, was dealt with. The destruction of these uarters would have stopped all vork on the site, even if there ad been no loss of life or ajury. Scottish Pulp and Paper Mills re integrated mills beginning vith trees and ending in paper, nd in between there are many omplex chemical processes. Fhese processes give rise to langerous gases, which must be ontrolled so that there is no scape or chance of escape. At he same time there must be ffective protection against gass- ng in the event of unexpected elease of dangerous fumes. Lines of Defence The equipment provided con- lists of three lines of defence: irst, personal gas masks as he very short-time protection; econd, a self-contained cylinder- ype fresh-air breathing appara- us where the person at risk :arried his own fresh air on his Pack; and finally, a laid-on fresh iir supply by manifold connec- ion from a reservoir of fresh ir, enabling a worker to be in L contaminated atmosphere for L long time (if needs be) to Lttend to gross escapes requiring ;ubstantial repair work. But the king-pin of accident )revention is people; no matter vhat equipment is provided, vhat safeguards are taken, what ;odes of practice are drawn up, ind what disciplines are en- 'orced, the worker must be L willing \"conformer\" to a afe way of life. He has to be piven knowledge, training and nstruction and supervision to :nsure that he knows what to lo, how to do it, and he must ie supervised to see that he does t-safeiy. These are the prin- :iples of work. Everyone, man- lging director to the mill floor, las been instructed and trained n the habits of an accident-free :ommunity.

IN. tXVbU3 MANAGER, LOCHABER WORKS, THE BRITISH ALUMINIUM COMPANY LIMITED With the opening of the new tities of electrical power at a gallons of water a day 15 miles Colourbond finish. As well, an rt William niant F Cttrlih Inw enct ncr unit- thi Mlilrhlande thrnk th mntk r natn. n1.. ... . .... .~. ... .... . Wan 100 opening oE tne new t Fort William plant of Scottish 11 Pulp and Paper Mills, two large * industrial organisations are now . neighbours within sight of Ben ; Nevis. For nearly 40 years the e British Aluminium Company has I been the largest employer in the c Lochaber district. Now the new c mill buildings with their bold, clean lines take their place in ; the striking setting of loch and mountains, three miles from n British Aluminium's smelter mn the shadow of the mountain. One of the reasons for the - siting of the new pulp and paper mill was an abundant supply of water. This same reason, among other considerations, originally led British Aluminium to choose Port William for the site of its t third reduction plant, t The economic production of c aluminium demands large quan. M M titles of electrical power at a low cost per unit; the Highlands of Scotland provided the best location for the hydrooelectric schemes necessary to produce i the power. The leader of the i aluminium industry in Britain, 1 BA, pioneered the development I of hydro.electric power for in.- dustrial use in this country. Earlier, British Aluminium's' primary production works in the Highlands had introduced modern industry and formed new I communities in a countryside 1 becoming de-populated by emigration, Bigger Capacity World War I caused a drama- i tic rise in aluminium produc. 1 tion and consumption. The in. i creased capacity was taken up 1 by growing industrial uses in i eaceutme. This rising demand ed the company to expand its i production capacity by building * third reduction plant and so the Lochaber works at Fort I William began production In 1929. But it was not until 1943 that all the stages of the I hydro-electrlo scheme serving the I Lochaber Works were fully do. I veloped. This scheme, together I with the reduction works, was the largst undertaking of its i kind to be carried out In Britain, I and involved driving a 15.ft. I diameter tunnel to bring 600m. I I I gallons of water a day 15 Miles through the mountains, When the paper mill venture was announced, BA welcomed it because of the increased opportunities it would bring to the Fort William area. From the beginning, the two companies have had ai \"good neighbour\" policy and British Aluminium has helped the establishment of the new mill in several ways. The pulp and paper making process also needs large quan- titles of fresh water and British Aluminium had ample supplies available-water which had already a purpose by generating electric power. An agreement was reached for BA to provide the Scottish Pulp and Paper Mills up to 50m. gallons a day. The water is taken from the tailrace of the power house which serves i the reduction plant. A 36-inch diameter pro-stressed concrete pipeline has beer laid to convey the water across to the mill at Corpach. For the exterior cladding of the mill, British Aluminium sup- plied nearly 100 tons of BACO Rigidal Classic sheeting with a BACO Colourbond finish. This I I a two-coat stoved paint system applied after forming the sheet so that the paint ilm is not subjected to stress. The colour I chosen by the architects for this I application was grey, while the aluminium flashings and facia boards were given a white Colourbond finish. As well, an aluminium-based insulated deck- ing system was used for some of the process buildings. Of the houses built for the Scottish Pulp and Paper staff, 25 are roofed with factory-made insulated panels faced with aluminium sheet. Houses built for Fort William Burgh Council for mill workers have been roofed with BACO Rigidal Lok- roll. a pre-formed aluminium roofing sheet with concealed fixings. Further Link There is one more way In which British Aluminium is associated with the newest High- land industry. Liquid aluminium sulphate used in the paper- making process is brought by road tankers from the Aberdeen plant of a British Aluminium associate company, Don Alum Limited, British Aluminium welcomes the fact that another company Is following Its pioneering example and that the Highlands have been chosen for the site of the first integrated pulp and paper mill in Britain. The new mill, the largest Industrial development in the Highlands since the war, should ensure the continuing prosperity of Fort William and bring new employ. ment to the area. - I NOW\"",

   "text_content" : "AL JLJdLTM The main points of the Com- monwealth Premiers' communique are: They remain unanimous on the objective that the rebellion in Rho. desia must be bought to an end speedily. In order to achieve this objective, most of the Heads of Government expressed their firm opinion that force was the only sure means of bringing down the illegal rgdime in Rhodesia. Others, however, shared the British Gov. ernment's objections to the use of force to impose a constitutional settlement, while agreeing that it was not ruled out where necessary to restore law and order. Most Heads of Government urged that Britain should make a cate. gorical declaration that independence would not be granted before majority rule is established on the basis of universal adult franchise and that this declaration should not be con. ditional on whether the illegal rdgime agreed to surrender or not. They further urged that Britain should refuse to resume discussions or to negotiate with the illegal regime. SSix Principles The British Prime Minister stated that the British Government would not recommend to the British Parlia- ment any constitutional settlement which did not conform with the six principles; that they attached parti cular mportance to the fifth principle, namely that any settlement must be, and be seen to be. acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole; that they eardd it as implicit in this fifth priciple that the test of accepts. bility must enable the people of Rhodesia as a whole to indicate whether or not they were prepared to accept any settlement which pro- vided for the grant of independence before majority rule was achieved: and that there would be no indepen. dence before majority rule if the people of Rhodesia as a whole were shown to be opposed to it. The conference noted the following decisions of the British Government: 1-After the illegal regime is ended a legal Government will be appointed by the Governor and will constitute a broadly based representative administration. During this interim period the armed Forces and police will be responsible to the Governor. Those individuals who are detained or restricted on political grounds will be released and normal political activities will be permitted provided that they are conducted peacefully and democratically without intimida. tion from any quarter. Majority Rule 2-The British Government will negotiate, with this interim admini- stration, a constitutional settlement directed to achieving the objective of majority rule. on the basis of the six principles. 3-This constitutional settlement will be submitted for acceptance to the people of Rhodesia as a whole by appropriate democratic means. 4-The British Parliament and Government must be satisfied that this test of opinion is fair and free and would be acceptable to the general world community. 5-The British Government will not consent to independence before majority rule unless the people of Rhodesia as a whole are shown 'o be in favour of it. Most, heads of Government made it clear that in their view political leaders and others detained should be ihunediately and unconditionally releaed before an interim represen- tative Government was formed, in whici.they should be adequately re- presented. They further expressed the view that any ascertainment of the wishes of the people of Rhodesia as a whole should be by a referendum based on universal adult suffrage, that is, one man, one vote. The Heads of Government aso ited that the British Gvernment oposed immediately to coImmiu te its intentions as ndicated above rough the Governor to all sections Sopinion in Rhodesia and to inform e llegal rgime there that If they e not prepared to take the initial id indispensable steps whereb the bellion is brought to an end end ;ecutive authority is vested in the overnor, the folownls related con. quences will ensue:- (a--The British Government will Itbdraw all previous proposal for constitutional settleent which ive been made; in partcular they ill not thereafter be prepared to ibmit to the British Parliaent any ttlement which involves indepen- !nce before majority rule. (b)-Given the full support of ommonwealth representatives at the nited Nations, the British Govern. ent will be prepared to join in onsoring in the Security Council of a United Nations before the end ! this year a resolution providing ,r effective and selective mandatory onomic sanctions against Rhodesia. The conference had before it an ,alysis of the working of economic ctilons prepared by the Sanctions ommittee set up in Lagos. It was Ireed that, though sanctions had un- )ubtedly depressed the Rbodesian ;nomy they were unlikely at their esent level to achieve the desired litical obiectives within an a ccet le period of time. Accordingy, e Heads of Government were gener- ly agreed on the need for stronger id mandatory economic sanctions ider Chapter VI of the United rC Â·Â· N vi it A N bi fa vi ct ti C C tl o 01 in tb th tl tc el ft tt ti si C b tl b tl ti ti Nations Charter. Most were con- vinced that mandatory' anctions of a general and comprehensive tharacter hould be applied under Chapter VpII Articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter, and should cover both exports and imports. Others favoured sanctions on selected indi. vidual commodities important to the economy of Rhodesia. The Heads of Government recorded their apprecia- tion of the work of the Sanctions Committee and requested it to con. tinue its work. Aid for Zambia There was unanimity of view that Commonwealth countries should con. tinue to co-operate to the fullest extent possible in the pursuit of these objectives for Rhodesia notwithstand. ing some differences of opinion as to the most effective means of achieving them. It was also agreed unanimously that assistance should be given to Zambia to produce a more complete cut-off of trade with Rhodesia and to assist-her to withstand any serious effect on her economy resulting there- from. To this end they requested that the Zambian sub-committee of the Sanctios Committee should con- tinue its efforts in co-ordinating further Commonwealth assistance. Continuing consideration should also be given to the problems of Malawi. The Heads of Government agreed that the problem of Rhodesia saould be kept under constant review, and that they would meet again soon if the illegal rgime were not brought to an end speedily. __ I",

Persistent reports circulating here suggest that a republid is about to be declared, as a reaction to the Commonwealth Conference's initi- ative.

Deputy Under-Secretary. Commonwealth Office, who has come out from SALISBURY, Sept. 14. London to inform the Governor of the British Government's pro- posals, to-day had two working sessions with Sir Humphrey Gibbs. The morning talks were also attended by Sir Hugh Beadle, Chief Justice of Rhodesia, and Mr. John Hennins. head of the British resi- dual mission in Salisbury. The presence of Sir Hugh Beadle may well be significant-lhe Chief Justice continues to be the principal potential intermediary between the U.K. Government and Mr. lan Smith.",

   "text_content" : "By OUr Foreign buat Mr. Joe Murumbi, Vice-President of Kenya, summed up what several of the African delegations felt about the communique. \"Though we did not achieve all we had hoped for at this Confer- ence, the fact that the African. Asian and Caribbean delegations were firm enabled us to extract from Mr. Wilson some concessions and admissions. Mr. Murumbi considered that the major concession was the with- drawal of any promises to grant independence before majority rule. \"It was clear to us that talks had taken place with the Smith Govern- ment for the granting of indepen- dence before majority rule. This would have presented a very dangerous situation. Now Mr. Wilson has agreed in effect to challenge the Smith Government, through the Governor, to give up control. Mr. Murumbi then pinpointed the major dilemma that will face Mr. Wilson. If Mr. Smith refuses to take the steps required, or if the Governor tries to form a Government without Mr. Smith's consent, there will be an open clash between the Governor and r. Smith. \"What steps will the British Government take then?\" said Mr. Murumbi. He added that the approach to Mr. Smith and the steps to form a broadly-based Government must be made \"within a month.\" He expected the Commonwealth Prime Ministers would meet again at the end of the year, or early in the New Year. On the parts of Britain's position which are not entirely satisfactory to the Africans, Mr. Murumbi said: \"We just could not press him any more-it was, take that or nothing. Finally, Mr. Murumbi agreed with the sentiment expressed by Mr. Arnold Smith, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, who had earlier said: \"In this strugle between the Commonwealth and Mr. Ian Smith, the Commonwealth is go- ing to win.\"",

   "text_content" : "With Covent Garden not so apparently planning to give The PA Trojans until 1969 (the centenary in of Berlioz's death) and a complete vi recording not yet in existence, we he have to make do with concert bt performances. ve A concert hall is a very good so place to listen to an opera, as the sic Proms have been reminding us. Of th course it is not in any important or sense an alternative to the theatre, sm nor is it meant to be. But you br hear the orchestra particularly et, well; and if you do not see the or work as it should be, nor do you ne see it as it should not be and as in al an imperfect world it often is, CÃ½ weakened or distorted by inade- fr quate stage representation. at Last night's performance of the 01 first two acts of The Trojans (The at Fall of Troy), given by the New st Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus under Colin Davis, was a sc wonderfully exhilarating occasion, tt The only pity was that it could not It go on, that the smoky C minor tl chord on which the temple holo- ti caust closes could not at once be s4 followed by the pulsing, sunlit E % flat of the opening scene at c4 Carthage-the performance had so c4 aroused one's appetite. Ii The LSO are to give The Trojan nr and Carthaginian acts in two con- si certs, only a few days apart, during s< December. That will be at the p Festival Hall, where last night's b forces were heard last yr. he er Pestival Hall undoubtedly allows i individual details to tell nmre pitl vividly and certain climaxes to me have more overwhelming impact, gt but the Albert Hall provides a chc very valuable element of space woj for the huge imaginative dimen- atta sions of the music to establish lac themselves in. What an extra- ordinary conception it is, the great sirs sweeping curve of Troy's fall from me brilliant, illusory victory down to rat] eternal night, the doom- springing pro on the city with terrible sudden- of ness like some dreadful beast-and she all seen and foreseen through dot Cassandra's eyes.

'he, chorus were as suerb * over, the women giving the, flait sce the attack and exaltation It always lacked at Covent Garden. Casiandra was sung for the first time, by Janet laker, very movingly. She was the woman rather than the priestess and prophetess-there was little sense of inspired frenzy about her-and she lacked the edge, the mettle to dominate the big crowd scenes (especially with the bands on stage, as it were), but she sang with profound eloquence of ex- pression, warmth of tone and nobility of utterance. The first aria in particular was gloriously done; her delivery of the central section, especially the phrase \"I love him, he loves me,\" was most memorable. The rest of the cast was fully up to its responsibilities. Raimund Herincx made a sonorous, vehement Choroebus. Ronald Dowd was the vital, intense Aeneas. and these singers were admirably supported by Don Garrard, Gregory Dempsey, Gwyn Griffiths and Donald Mclntyre among others. Colin Davis con- ducted with all the fire and authority and tenderness that one has come to expect.",

   "text_content" : "Shaw revival or no Shaw revival. it was a brave act on the part of the Mermaid to make a double bill of Shaw's The Man of Destiny and O'Flaherty, V.C. in 1966. The Man of Destiny, though it's seen revivals enough, is a pretty thin bit of contrived melodrama, rather in the mood of \"The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard,\" only enlivened by Shavian dialogue. As for O'Flaherlv, V.C., it was written in 1915 to stimulate the flow of Irish recruits for the Great War, as they called it then, and the points it makes have little bearing on our world to-day. Well, the Mermaid's bravery seems likely to bring its just reward, for both plays turn out very well. Ian McKellen is well cast as Napoleon in the first play. Oh, he isn't much like Napoleon as he must have been in 1796, but I don't suppose Shaw really meant him to be. He wanted an ambitious young man with a great future to present in a romantic milieu, and JNapoleon answered his specification exactly. Mr. McKellen makes him young and improbably handsome, and he is thoroughly at home with Shaw's orotund speeches--the dis- sertation on ambition, the \"devour- ing devil\" which he throws vainly BOOKS al, at the innkeeper, the long analysis of of the English character to which al ill he treats the Strange Lady: he 1C nd gives them a fizz that momentarily t an makes one believe they're much b' is better than they are. of yl in Such plot as there is concerns S of the attempts of this Strange Lady G ed to wheedle Napoleon's despatches gi *or from him before he reads them, o in because they include a private sh letter that will cause a scandal in ey high places. It is cunningly teased C it out with the kind of ingenuity that s] iur Shaw disapproved of in Sardou, cl and it provides a splendid part for b the Lady, who not only goes p , through the gamut of the emotions r in her own person but then does h as so again lightly disguised as her h he imaginary twin brother. Sian tl h Phil ps makes a delightful thing d I of it, though I think she might a int extract a little more robustness ,us from her make-up box if she is tl to really to persuade us that she is a it nd high-spirited young woman and not h on dying of consumption. p im In the remaining two parts, b ie, Timothy Carlton does well as the J. ith arrogant, asinine young cavalry t( is- officer from whom the Lady origin- p ir- ally steals the despatches. and Bill c ily Wallis is a beguiling innkeeper. gi u ransery, v.L.. is a iypiai ex*c ample of the way in which Shaw's craftsmanship sustains a play to-day after all his arguments have been resolved. It is a talk-piece devoted to the reactions of a simple young Irish soldier to the local squire (who happens also to be a General), to his mother and to his girl when he meets them at the end of a recruiting campaign. It is, however, a warm and funny play whose central character, young O'Flaherty, commands a bundle of sympathy, even though the characters surrounding him are a bit flat. Ian McKellen plays this part too, his curly wig doffed to reveal a regulation Army haircut, his belt and buttons impeccable, his puttees wound with an expertise that I never learnt in the far-off days when I had to wear these abominations in the school OTC. Marie Kean makes a parody of the boy's termagant mother, but it can be argued that Shaw made her a parody first. General Sir Pearce Madigan is a parody too, but not such a broad one, and John McKelvey keeps him down to the ground in a nicely-observed performance. Shivaun O'Casey is coolly convincing as the mercenary girl-friend, Teresa Driscoll. V, o si S n ii i e a ii a a s: a d s n v e r sl Sl t",

The Soldier's Art (middle volume of the wartime trilogy) takes its name from Browning's line, \"Think first, fight afterwards -the soldier's art;\" it begins with the fall of Paris in June, 1940 and ends with the invasion of Russia a year later Nick Jenkins realls- ing immedaltely that the Nazis will be conquered in the end. But 1940/1941 were defensive months; the blitzes, Greece, Crete, the Middle East. The Valley of Bones, first volume of the war trilogy, gave us the Army at Infantry Training level in Ulster. In The Soldier's Art, we proceed to Divisional H.Q. In Belfast, with Widmerpool (already a major), plotting the moves which get him posted at the end of the book to the War Cabinet Offices, Nick Jenkins, his assistant, sees from below Widmer. pool in a light which shows him still comic, but also monstrous and ruthless In ambition. No thanks to Widmerpool, Nick at the end Is told to report to the War Ofice, where in the next volume he will clearly be directed into cloak and dagger warfare. The high comedy is magnificently sustalned, Nick buyng uniform from a Military and Theatrical tailors from an assistant convinced he will wear it on the West End stage not in the theatre of war.

The Quince gang, who run a Protection Racket, are criminal police, enforcing law and order at a price, and beating up all those who refuse to pay the rice. Toms shows the difficulty of convicting criminals who suborn witnesses, bribe or intimidate jurymen, murder informers, torture victims. Strange, an up- right constable from the training school, tries to live up to his highest principles and will not identify as members of the Quince gang the stockinged men who beat him insensible and drove a nail through his cheeks and tongue, when he came to the aid of a Jewish trader who had refused to pay protection money. Yet it is Strange, who is sent for a year's imprisonment, when he falls into the hands of an insane Challoner- type sergeant who blackmails him into framing a member of the Quince gang Anyone like myself for whom the complicated torture case at the Clerkenwell cour* is impossible to read will find in The Strange Afair an orderly account of the climate in which such alleged hor- rors can continue without being the subject of prosecution.
