WEDNESDAY Evening. The outstanding event in City circles to-day was the announcement of the transfer of about Â£280,000,000 of gold from the issue department of the Bank of England to the Exchange Equalisation Account following the agreement between the Treasury and the Bank. This is the second largest gold transfer on record, the previous largest being the Â£350,000,000 in January of this year. In the foreign exchange market authorised and unauthorised dealers re- ported a greater amount of selling of dollars and only moderate withdrawals of funds. Conditions in the discount market were more comfortable and a smaller dis- placement of credit was reported. Over- night accommodation against bills was available at 3 per cent. and against bonds at 3/% per cent. Clearing banks were not active buyers of bills, but October dates were taken at 3' per cent. and November dates at 3% per cent. L\"As DIscouNT PEILK CENT. PE CENT. Bank Bills FineTradeBills Day.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 6th Sept. Stocks were erratic after yesterday's spectacular upswing as operators hastened to take their profits, but fresh buying resulted in small gains among Rails, Tobaccos, Merchandisings and Utilities. Elsewhere, losses extended to 2 points. Turnover totalled 3,940,000 shares, against 5,930,000 yesterday. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average eased 0.08 to 148.04, but Rails rose 0.20 to 29.16, Utilities being un- changed at 23.79. Dealings comprised 976 stocks, of which 462 declined, 381 im- proved and 133 were unaltered. Turnover in bonds broke all records at $83,120,000, of which $71,220,000 was in U.S. Government issues, whose prices further declined, necessitating Federal Reserve support. Aeroplane manufacturers are to continue to accelerate production and intend to dis- pose of it in the U.S. if the embargo on shipments to belligerents is not lifted. The \"Iron Age \" states that steel mill activity this week is at 59 per cent. of capacity, against 63.5 last week, the de- cline being due to the holiday. Steel ex- porters are flooded with cables from all parts of the world seeking supplies and urging deliveries of orders previously placed. Export prices have advanced several dollars per ton to parity with domestic prices. The Neutrality Act, the journal points out, does not prohibit the sale abroad of raw materials, including steel, iron and scrap."

   "text_content" : "WEDNESDAY Evening. Security dealing in Throgmorton Street and between offices was gener- ally less active than yesterday, but price movements provided many points of interest. Oils attracted more attention, with improvements in some leading shares and in West African Gold and Rhodesian Copper shares. American Industrials were moderately active. A full list of to-day's prices appears on the back page. Reasons for to-day's smaller turn- over included the lateness of the morn- ing postal delivery and the fact that yesterday's activity included several days' accumulation of orders from some brokers' offices. The prospect of the House reopening to-morrow also led to a disposition to restrict activity. Gilt-edged securities were definitely quieter to-day, and prices generally were reduced to their fixed minima. Jobbers quoted only one price, although some deal- ings at slightly higher levels were reported. Conversion 4% per cents, were stated to be in good demand at the minimum price. Activity in the Foreign market was on about the same scale as yesterday. A rise in German 5 per cents, to 15 and of Hun- garian 4% per cents, to 17% were the principal price movements. The Home Railway market did prac- tically no business, pending to-morrow's opening. Prices were unaltered, but quotations were widened slightly. Foreign Rails were quiet, with irregular changes in prices. Canadian Pacifies re- sponded feebly to the higher New York parity by rising to 4%. American Rails and Industrials were decidedly more active. A demand at prices well below parities permitted the closing of some bull accounts, and the contango in Americans is believed to have been reduced by the opportunity for closing provided by the rise in prices in New York. INDUSTRIALS QUIETER Dealings in Industrial shares were on a narrower basis than yesterday. At the outset a few dealers met in the Street, but as there was more talk than business, the gathering soon dispersed and dealing once more became a matter for negotiation by telephone. Among the bright features were Im- perial Chemicals with a rise of Is 6d to 30s 3d and United Molasses with a gain of Is 3d to 24s 3d. Some of the Shipping shares, which went ahead yesterday, sus- fered a partial reaction, but there still was inquiry for this class of Industrial. Courtaulds opened 4'd better at 29s, advanced to 30s and finally came back to 29s. British-American Tobaccos gained %e, but Imperials lost that amount. Sudan Plantations, which rose 9d yesterday, gained Is further to 25s. OILS MORE ACTIVE Although the experience of dealers in Oil shares was somewhat mixed it seemed definite that a little more inquiry was re- ceived and a little more business done in this market than yesterday. The firmness of Shells and Royal Dutch again was the principal feature, the former improving %, to 4%/ and the latter 3 to 40. An improvement in Burmahs provided another feature, the shares gaining % to 3% as the result of a small demand. V.O.C. at 20s 7'1d were another firm spot. Quotations for Rubbers advanced strongly, although no business was re- ported. Demand was inspired by the rising price of the raw material in New York. Bidding for Rubber Trust raised the price 2s 6d to 28s 9d. United Sua Betong put on a similar amount at 48s 9d, together with Anglo-Dutch to 26s 3d. JUMP IN ASHANTI There was even less attempt to deal in Kaffirs to-day than yesterday, although a generally optimistic feeling was discern- ible among the dealers present that quo- tations, anyway of the producers' shares, are likely to be rather higher to-morrow, when the Stock Exchange re-opens, than the closing levels of last Thursday. East Rand Props. were heard at 2%-/,, better than yesterday-Venterspost also '/i up at lVs, as were Sallies at 3%. In other Gold share sections, however, the bumper sterling gold price of 168s per ounce-by far the highest ever reached- was making itself felt, particularly in the West African group. Ashanti were an outstanding example. At one time jobbers were seeking the offer of these shares at as high as 3% compared with yesterday's level of 3%,, which was already %Y above Thursday's close. The final price men- tioned was 3% middle. RHODESIAN COPPERS RISE The rise in the American copper price to above 12 cents a pound caused prices of the shares to be marked up, buyers predominating. Rhokana at 12% were called % higher than yesterday's nominal level. Rho- desian Anglo American were Is higher on the day at 23s, Roan Is 9d up at 17s 3d, and Rhodesian Selection Is to the good at 15s. Selection Trust were mentioned at 14s 6d, a gain of Is 6d compared with last Thursday's close, and Nchanga %' better at 1%6. Tin shares were generally regarded as being nominally higher. Among Diamonds, a \"tiny\" lot of De Beers Deferred changed hands at 5'\"., which compares with 5% middle last Thursday. Full list of prices Page Four",

   "text_content" : "More members in the City, but less business done, was the impression I gained of yesterday's scratch market as compared with Tuesday's With the House reopening this morning there was a general inclina- tion among leading firms to postpone trying to deal until they saw how things were working out to-day. One burly broker said he tried, under pres- sure, to carry out a special order, but was unsuccessful. Ashanti Goldfields West Africans were strongly bid for yesterday afternoon as being presum- ably in a position to reap much larger benefits than Kaffirs from the record price of gold. Few shares changed hands because jobbers had very little stock available for cash dealings. Ashanti Goldfields shot up half a sovereign further to 75s. The corpora- tion produces nearly 22,000 ozs monthly, which in July yielded a net profit of Â£107,500 with gold at 148s per ounce. At 168s gross revenue would be raised by approximately Â£22,000, of which possibly Â£4,000 would be absorbed by the 15 per cent. duty on the gold premium and the West African 5 per cent. profits tax. An extra Â£18,000 profit a month would equal 17 per cent. per annum on the corporation's capital; recent earnings have averaged 1041 per cent. per annum on the 4s shares. Ariston Record Ariston had a late jump of Is to 12s 6d on the August return, showing that the final 476 ozs of gold produced last month is being valued at the new price of 168s per ounce. The record profit was earned of Â£36,200, nearly Â£2,000 more than in July. Had the whole of the August output of 7,017 ozs been taken at 168s the revenue would have been increased by an additional Â£6,000, subject to tax. Although Ariston crushed the record total of 15,500 tons last month the full capacity of the new plant is at least 20,000 tons. In June I cal- culated that when that rate of treat- ment was reached net earnings (after appropriations for development, depre- ciation, etc.) ought to be at least 44 per cent. per annum on the capital of Â£900,000 in 2s 6d shares. If gold is maintained at 168s- nearly Â£1 above its June price-and the same grade of ore is treated then it would seem that net profits of around 55 per cent. per annum may be foreseen. Ont itarit"

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange fills up to-day with members and clerks who have been separated from it, after all, for no more than four business days. So much has happened in the interval as to make it feel as though the House had been closed for a month. There are still many matters of detail to be settled in connection with the present state of emergency as these affect Stock Exchange procedure, and the Settlement which should have been arranged to-day is postponed, as already announced, for a fortnight. There remains, however, the residue of previous accounts to be settled, and the current conditions should be useful in assisting to get outstanding bargains squared up. Postponement of Settlement Inconvenience and trouble will no doubt be suffered by clients who sold stock for Settlement to-day and who find that the Stock Exchange Committee have postponed the Account day for a fortnight. The necessity for this will be more readily appreciated if it is realised that, with the House closed, the normal opera- tion of Stock Exchange machinery presents a number of difficulties. The agreement upon making-up prices, the running of the Settlement Depart- ment, the passing of names, the pre- paration and delivery of transfers, suddenly assume an importance which, in the ordinary course of events, is never considered. The Stock Exchange Committee know full well that the postponement of a Settlement is sure to create in- dividual hard cases. But the measure, like all the other emergency regula- tions, was framed for the greatest good of the greatest number, and a fourteen days delay is not likely to cause more than a passing difficulty. Called Up There will be a remarkable difference in the look of the markets to-day as compared with that of last Thursday. The calling up to the Armed Forces will reveal how large a proportion of the younger Stock Exchange generation belongs to one or other arm of the Services. Older men who thought they were falling out of the business ranks will find they are' required to fill up gaps caused by the absence of those prepar- ing for a struggle very different from that to which they are accustomed in the House. The Stock Exchange reputation, won in every previous war, can be safely left in the hands of those, connected with the House, whose ordinary places are to-day vacant."

   "text_content" : "Concentration of the resources of the country to assist in the effective prosecution of the war has been the objective of every action taken by the Government in the financial sphere during the crisis. Yesterday's trans- ser of Â£278,965,000 of gold-virtually the whole stock-from the Issue De- partment of the Bank of England to the remodelled Exchange Equalisation Account is another step in the same direction. The underlying principle is universally accepted as being sound. There can be no valid criticism of a decision which, although it entails a break with tradition, does little more than complete a process already far advanced. The Currency and Bank Notes Act passed last March linked the gold holdings of the Bank of England and the Exchange Account more closely together by providing for transfer between them as might be required. It left the Issue Depart- ment with Â£226,414,500 of gold (as revalued) to form the foundation of the note issue, but even so the major part-Â£300,000,000-was of a fiduciary character. In other words, the credit of the Government was confirmed as the ulti- mate guarantee of British currency, and no one in this country (or in most others, for that matter) would ask for a better one. Once the right to demand gold in exchange for bank notes was abrogated, maintenance of a gold reserve in the Issue Department served little practical purpose. Recog- nition of that fact was implicit in the Act already cited. The defence of the pound has taken on a new and vital aspect, as the public will be quick to acknowledge, while their experience that earlier changes affecting the note backing have made no practical difference to themselves will keep confidence undiminished under the new conditions. The amount of the fiduciary issue will be raised by Â£280,000,000-rounding off the gold figure by the addition of little more than Â£1,000,000-but the whole trans- action, leaving the aggregate note issue almost unchanged, contains no inflationary element. The figures compare with a holding of some Â£263,000,000 shown in the last Bank Return, but the difference is due to the increase in the sterling price of gold in the meantime. Once again it is of interest to con- trast present action with'that taken on the outbreak of war in 1914. At that time the public had been accustomed to gold coinage-a thing to which most of the present generation are complete strangers. Whereas in 1914, therefore, people had to get used to the Treasury notes then issued as an emergency measure, they will now continue to employ the Bank notes which have been their usual means of payment since 1928. Shopper and shopkeeper will do business together in just the same way as usual, and the absence of dislocation will be an important factor in continuing the smooth running of every-day affairs. Few of the steps necessitated by the outbreak of war have succeeded in serving the national interest without interfering in some way with private business. As such, this one probably is unique, but its real value lies in the convenience which will result from having the nation's unrevealed, but none the less huge, resources for foreign payment brought directly under one control.",

   "text_content" : "The Control of Employment Bill is a measure which should assist materi- ally in the best use of the nation's industrial man-power during the war, and is of a type which has already been strongly urged in these columns. The object is to limit where necessary the advertising of vacancies in any industry, so as to prevent undue com- petition between private enterprise and the armament factories for avail- able man-power. It would be a serious and misleading misnomer to describe the Bill as one for the mobilisation of labour. The Minister is not put in a position where he can compel a work- man to leave employment with which he is content, nor can he force the acceptance of any particular employ- ment. This was pointed out by Mr. Grenfell on behalf of the Labour Party, and Mr. Ernest Brown re- sponded readily to the suggestion that discussion between the Government and the employers' and workers' organisations should be required statutorily before the making of any order. The Government is evidently anxious to use to the full the existing voluntary industrial machinery. It is not anticipated that it will be necessary to make wide use of the new powers in the early days of the war except in limited classes of occupa- tion where there will be a very special demand for labour. It is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon the desirability of the Government acquiring such powers to control and influence the flow of labour. The most recent employment returns showed that the country was faced by the near approach of a state of full effective em- ployment with all its attendant prob- lems,.and in many trades it was evident that there was already a shortage of labour. Now that war has been forced upon us the most effective use of our man-power is of paramount impbrtance, and it is essential that the defence in- dustries should have the first call upon our labour resources. All this is self- evident, but it should be borne in mind that it took a very long time after the outbreak of the last war to secure the acceptance of any such principles as are implied in the present measure, and it is reassuring that the task should be so quickly tackled in the present instance.",

For the year to 30th June a fresh high record of profits has been registered. The aggregate return of the company and subsidiaries has risen from Â£330,100 to Â£364.200, before tax, and for the parent company itself a profit is shown of Â£336,000, an increase of Â£30,900. These results must be fully up to the expectations voiced by the Chairman at the last meeting. On the increased capital the divi- dend is maintained at 25 per cent. for the year. This is earned with the comfortable surplus of Â£45,400 (equal to nearly 6.9 per cent.), as compared with Â£35,300 last time. General re- serve is raised by Â£50,000, thereby restoring a substantial part of the amount of Â£82,800 withdrawn for the capital bonus. At the last quoted price of 21s-on Thursday of last week-the Ordinary 5s shares would yield about 6 per cent."

Earnings of that company have been affected by the falling off in demand for coke and the drop in prices, and the parent company re- ceived in dividends from that source only Â£9,000 net, as compared with Â£45,000 in the previous year. Total profits are down from Â£100,900 to Â£58,500, out of which Â£25,000, as before, is set aside for depreciation. Payment of the reduced dividend is possible only by crediting Â£13,700 written back from income-tax reserve and making a draft of nearly Â£4,000 on the carry-forward.

It is, perhaps, the least that might have been anticipated in view of the active trading conditions ex- perienced by this well-known manufac- turer of steel conduits, fittings and accessories required in connection with electrical installations. Indeed, it may well be that the company will make new high records for turnover this year. Speaking at the meeting of shareholders last April, Mr. A. E. Read stated that all departments were working to full capacity and that sales for the first four months of the year compared very favourably with those of the corre- sponding period of 1938. Although the company was not at that time engaged directly on rearmament work, its standard products must play an essential part in any scheme of elec- trical developments arising out of peace-time needs or war preparedness. The export trade has been extremely difficult, but the elimination of German competition from a large number of overseas markets should help to im- prove the position-provided that the increasing demands on the home front leave sufficient opportunity for further branching out abroad.",

The business is that of supplying operatives in. factories and works throughout the country with suitable overalls and garments without initial cost to the customer. At the price of a weekly charge the garments are re- paired, generally serviced and replaced when necessary with new ones. The company's finances are strong and the goodwill item is relatively modest in relation to the capital involved.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "From our MARINE INSURANCE CORRESPONDENT oeverain iportant developments took place in the war risk insurance market yesterday. Firstly, as fore- cast in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, the Government Cargo War Risk Insurance Office has agreed to accept \"Open Covers\" under the following conditions:- ,1. Cover granted will entitle the appli- cant to declare his usual shipments once a week up to the maximum amount per vessel specified on the cover, the rates of premium chargeable being the rates current on the day when the vessel in question sailed. 2. On declarations being submitted they will he tendered to the underwriters to determine the rates. Accompanied by the applicant's provisional cover they will then he put through the hooks in the same way as other definite insurances. 3. The definite insurances or insurances declared against the provisional cover can be effected either by the issue of separate certificates (as required) or by the issue of a comprehensive certificate with a list of declarations appended to it. This means that the customary method of insuring cargo under \"open covers\" will proceed. RISKS HELD COVERED A second very helpful announcement by the War Risk Insurance Office yesterday reads:- In consequence of the difficulty in transacting business in the present emergency, the Committee of the War Risk Insurance Office agree that until further notice war risks will be held covered on the following conditions:- 1. A War Risk Application Slip must be presented within 72 hours of the receipt of an order to insure with the War Risk Insurance Office, accom- panied by the instructions to insure as evidence of the time of the receipt of the order. 2. The rates of premium applicable in these cases will be the rate ruling on the date of the receipt of the order, subject to sailing within seven days, or held covered at the rates current on the date of sailing. The Government Office also announces that unless risks are tendered for accep- tance before 2 p.m. it cannot guarantee delivery of the certificates till the follow- ing day. This means that if an order is tendered for acceptance before 2 p.m. the broker can rely on receiving the certifi- cate the same day and can despatch it to his client the same evening. TWO NEW RATES Two new rates have been fixed by the Joint War Risk Rating Committee for the general schedule which applies to business that does nnt come within the Govern- ment's scheme. They are: North Central and South America (Atlantic and Pacific ports)-To or from Australasia via the Cape, 60s per cent. To or from Aus- tralasia via Panama Canal, 20s per cent. The return of 50 per cent. for vessels not proceeding north of the equator applies to the paragraph of the general schedule No. 20 under local and miscellaneous voyages Africa-Africa (excluding Mediterranean) including shipments between Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and adjacent islands, 60s per cent. CAPTURE CLAUSE The Institute of London Underwriters also announces that until further notice the current schedule rates and all subse- quent alterations published by the Rating Committee are subject to the inclusion in the Insurance Conditions of the British and Allied Capture Clause. This clause, adopted during the Great War, is to the effect that no claim shall attach to the policy arising from capture, seizure, arrest, restraint or detainment, except by the enemies of Great Britain or by the enemies of the country to which the assured or the ship belongs.",

   "text_content" : "Diversities of prices of leading Ameri- can shares between London and New York attracted some attention in Stock Ex- change circles yesterday. The existence of these differences shows how the two markets have been divorced by the Treasury Order regarding registra- tion and dealing in foreign currency securities, and also by the present cabling difficulties and high insurance rates. The following list shows the differences between Tuesday's English equivalent of New York's'closing prices, and yesterday's opening figures in London:- New York London Diff'ce close opening in Friday Wednesday price N.Y.C. ...... $19' $16% $3 U.S. Steel ... $81% $77% $4/ Anacondas .. Â£9'/A Â£8Y Â£1%Y Intl. Nickels $67% $62 $5% The London market adopted a very cautious attitude at the outset, considering that the wild market in Wall Street over- night had carried the \"war babies\" to prices inviting a temporary reaction. Moreover, the American public had apparently been unaware of the strength of President Roosevelt's warning against exporting armaments, including aero- planes. Where dealings in London were pos- sible, the buyers, believed to be two City houses, were willing to give no more than several dollars below the overnight parities. Although these buyers seemed to be attempting to get shares at low prices, they had to take the risk of a sharp setback in Wall Street when dealings reopened there at three o'clock London time. This risk was increased by cabling delays and increased expense of sending messages in plain language. In addition, many formalities have had to be complied with in making proceeds of resales available to the British Treasury. The houses who were buyers of Ameri- cans yesterday were practically the only supporters of Americans, and their opera- tions were restricted, probably owing to the risks involved, after a certain business had been done. Nevertheless, their aggre- gate purchases were quite considerable. It is believed that the demand at a time when New York had risen strongly created market conditions which enabled some bull accounts on this side to be closed, and sensibly reduced the open account in American shares."

   "text_content" : "The fifth annual, meeting of the members of Allied Industrial Services. Limited, was held yesterday at Netherwood Chambers, Bradford. MR. W. H. RHODES presided. The Secretary (Mr. C. Gordon Slaker. C.A.) read the notice convening the meet- ing. The minutes of the last annual general meeting held on the 29th September, 1938. and of the extra-ordinary general meeting held on the 19th December, 1938, were read and signed. It was resolved that the directors' re- port and accounts and the auditors' report thereon as laid before the meeting be taken as read. The Chairman said: Ladies and gentle- men,-At this, our fifth annual meeting, your directors are able to report an in- crease in the company's business and profits, which this year, after providing for depreciation, directors' fees and other charges, amount to Â£204,695 9s 4d. As I have just mentioned, the profits for the year under review amount to Â£204,695 9s 4d, and after adding thereto Â£1,511 6s 7d, being the profit and loss ac- count balance carried forward from last year, less the amount deducted to provide part of the capital bonus distributed in December, 1938, the sum of Â£206,206 15s 11d is available for alloca- tion. It is with deep regret that I have to record the loss which your Board suffered in April last through the death of my father. Mr. W. Rhodes, who, as you are aware, was one of the managing directors of this company, and who for over 30 years was chairman to the Board of Directors of Hill Rhodes and Wilkinson, Ltd.-our predecessors. CURRENT YEAR'S PROSPECTS It is my custom at our annual general meeting to touch briefly on the trading prospects of your company for the current year. On this occasion I do not propose to comment beyond stating that since the commencement of the present financial year business has been satisfactory. Before formally proposing the resolu- tion adopting the accounts, I should like to express my thanks to our managers, staff and workpeople, who have respec- tively controlled and handled with pains- taking care the multiplicity of detail in connection with the immense number of individual transactions involved in a busi- ness of this magnitude. I now beg to move:- \"That the report of the directors, in- cluding the allocations and statement of accounts for the year ended 30th June, 1939, with the report of the auditors thereon, as submitted, be received, ap- proved and adopted.\" The motion was seconded, put to the meeting and duly passed. The following resolution was also put to the meeting and passed:- \"That the Preference dividends for the two half-years to 30th June, 1939, and the interim Ordinary dividend, already paid. be confirmed, and that a final dividend of 36 per cent. (actual) for the year ended 30th June, 1939, making 50 per cent. for the year (less tax) be and is hereby de- clared payable on the 7th September, 1939, to the Ordinary shareholders of the company.\" Mr. G. H. Swinton, the director retiring under article 83 of the company, and Mr. W. M. Christie, the director retiring by rotation, were re-elected, and the auditors, Messrs. Rawlinson Smith and Mitchell, were reappointed. A vote of thanks to the directors and staff having been proposed, seconded and passed, the Chairman replied in appro- priate terms and thus the meeting was brought to a close.",

The Tanker Pool, in which the great majority of tanker owners participated, regulated to some extent the supply of tonnage by the maintenance of a fund derived from a levy upon freight earnings out of which owners of laid-up vessels received compensation. Thus owners were encouraged to lay up ships when freights were unduly low. Suspension of the pool arises out of the obvious fact that the demand for tankers must now increase and there should shortly be no difficulty in obtaining employment for them at remunerative rates. It is desirable from the point of view of this country that the chartering of tankers should be facilitated rather than re- stricted. Although the pool is inter- national in scope it had the good will of the big oil companies, many of which are dentified with British interests.",

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Some two hours after the statement had been made in the House of Commons that a transfer of about Â£280,000,000 of gold was to be made from the Bank of England to the Ex- change Equalisation Account, the Bank duly announced the sale of Â£278,965,228 of bar gold. The reason for this huge operation -the second during the current year- would have been obvious even if the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not given it in Parliament. At this time of stress and strain it is essential that the control of the country's resources of foreign exchange and gold should be vested in one quarter, and it is natural that such control should be with the Treasury. Hence the amalgamation of the Exchange Equalisation Account's resources and the gold hitherto held in the Issue Department of the Bank of England. The evidence of this strong fighting fund-it is a vast war chest- should have a considerable moral effect. It should strengthen the psychological position of sterling. No Inflation It should be noted that the concomi- tant increase in the fiduciary issue which this operation involves does not give rise to an inflation of credit. All that will happen is that the Bank's Issue Department will now hold only a nominal amount of gold (maybe the gold coin only)-it will be a strange Bank Return to-day-and, in lieu of the gold handed over, it will receive Â£280,000,000 of securities (probably Treasury bills) from the Exchange Account. The total note circulation will be expanded only to the extent to which the gold stock of the Bank had been written up since the revaluation of a week ago. In the interim, of course, gold has risen 9s 6d per fine ounce. Exchange Dealings The new regimentation in the foreign exchange market has in- creased the work of the banks at least tenfold. The volume of queries -major and minor-arising from the forms is really remarkable and as even \"official \" elucidation is not readily forthcoming at the moment there is already considerable delay in the conclusion of business. All dealers yesterday-authorised and unauthorised-reported fairly considerable offerings of American dollars and there is not the slightest doubt that, thus far, the Treasury has received far more dollars-and other foreign currency-than it has had to provide. The fact that the official rate was pitched at so low a level induced con- siderable liquidation of the large bull position which had been built up in dollars before the peg was removed from sterling. Holders of these dol- lars now have to place them at the disposal of the Treasury. Under the new mechanism of foreign exchange dealings the banks are unable to marry buying and sell- ing orders and they are completely barred from taking up a position in any currency. Their profit is strictly limited to the commission charge of A per cent. which, as explained here yes- terday, is about i cent on the U.S. dollar rate. The official quotation for sterling was repeated yesterday at $4.02 to $4.06 and the official gold price was fixed at 168s. dollars and there is not the slightest doubt that, thus falÂ·, the Treasury has received far more dollars--and other foreign currency-than it has had to provide.

   "text_content" : "Gold to the value of Â£280,000,000 was yesterday transferred from the Issue Department of the Bank of England to the Exchange Account which, under the Currency (Defence) Act, can be used by the Government for war purposes. This action was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons, in the following state- ment:- The House already knows that, in order to strengthen our financial resources abroad, powers have been taken to place private holdings of gold, foreign exchange and foreign securities at the disposal of the Government. As a further measure to the same end, and with a view to concentrating all the Government's foreign resources in one reserve, the Treasury and the Bank of England have agreed that, except as regards a nominal amount, the whole of the gold now held in the Issue Department should be transferred to the Exchange Account as now constituted under the Currency (Defence) Act, 1939. Gold to the value of approximately Â£280,000,000 will accordingly be so transferred to-day. This transfer will entail an increase in the fiduciary note issue of the Bank to Â£580,000,000. A Treasury minute authorising such an increase will be laid before Parliament. OVER Â£400,000,000 SINCE JANUARY The present transfer of gold follows the handing over to the Exchange Fund of Â£200,000,000 in January last. The Stock Exchange resumes business to-day at the usual hour, but will close at 3 p.m. instead of 4 p.m. Business will be governed by the temporary regulations in force during the past two days. The actual total of gold affected, as announced by the Bapk of England in its daily notice of bullion movements, is Â£278,965,228, valued at the now official gold price of 168s per fine ounce. The fiduciary note issue has been raised by Â£280,000,000 to Â£580,000,000. This huge transfer means that the gold in the Issue Department of the Bank of England will in future be only of a nominal amount. This, it is pre- sumed, will be the gold coin holding. PREVIOUS TRANSFER Â£200,000,000 in January The transfer is the second biggest in the history of the Bank of England. Early in January this year the Bank transferred Â£200,000,000 of gold to the Exchange Fund, but that amount was valued at the old parity price of 85s per fine ounce and its current value, therefore, would have been just over Â£395,000,000. Its value at the market price of gold ruling in January was Â£350,000,000. The effect of this latest operation will be to eliminate almost completely the gold holding in the Issue Department. The object of the move is to concentrate all the gold and exchange resources of the coun- try in the hands of one department-the British Treasury. It really puts into prac- tice what has really existed in theory since the Issue Department of the Bank and the Exchange Fund have been vir- tually a single Government department for some time. It should be emphasised that the in- crease in the fiduciary issue will not involve any inflation in credit. The total note issue will be augmented only to the extent of the written up value of the gold. To-day's Bank of England return will make strange reading. The fiduciary issue will figure at Â£580,000,000, and, apart from minor adjustments, the main item of the assets held against it will be Other Government Securities, which will be around Â£564.8 millions. The reserve of notes in the Banking De- partment will depend upon the extent to which the active note issue has increased, or otherwise, in the interim, and upon the policy which the authorities adopt to offset the writing up of the gold.

   "text_content" : "The Treasury announced through the Ministry of Information last night that, in addition to the credits recently granted to Poland by the British and French Governments, a financial agreement has been reached between the British, French and Polish Governments which provides for a cash loan of about Â£8,500,000 to the Polish Government on the part of the British and French Govern- ments. The agreement is being signed at the Foreign Office to-day. In the early negotiations in London it was reported that Poland was seeking a loan of Â£5,000,000 from Britain and Â£3,500,000 from France. Britain has already granted to Poland export credits for Â£8,163,300, against which the Polish Government is to issue bonds bearing interest at 5 per cent. per annum and repayable over 16 years commencing in 1941. An agreement to this effect was signed on 2nd August.

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL THE FINANCIAL TIMES learns that the present intention of the London Pas- senger Transport Board is that its full accounts should be published next month. Control of the Board, like that of the main line railway companies, has passed to the Government through the Railway Executive Committee. As has been stated in THE FINANCIAL TIMES, it is unlikely that more than skeleton accounts will be issued by the four group companies. Unlike the main lines, which passed under control with only two-thirds of their financial year completed, the Board had already closed its accounts on 30th June last. The figures are in an advanced stage of preparation, but owing to the fact that most of the staff have been put upon other work it may be necessary to delay publication of the report and accounts until after the first week in October, the usual time of issue. FOUR PER CENT. EXPECTED Although it is unlikely that more than 4 per cent. will be forthcoming for the whole year-it may be less in view of present circumstances-on the \" C \" stock, failure once more to meet the statutory rate of 5% per cent. will not have its previous significance. An interim pay ment of 1% per cent, was made in February last. It will be recalled that \" C\" stock- holders have had the right to apply for a receiver since a year ago, when 4 per cent. was paid, but have deferred action pend- ing the result of the increase in fares sanctioned in May last. Since the Govern- ment has now assumed control of the Board's undertaking no action for a receivership could be pursued. The \" C stock was unchanged yester. day at 66.",

The directors are recommending a final payment of 10d per 5s share, making with the interim distribu- tion a total of 25 per cent. The issued Ordinary capital is Â£1,023,181 as increased by the scrip bonus of 10 per cent. a year ago and the offer in July of 449,446 5s shares at 23s. The latter rank for the final dividend only. The preliminary statement shows profit for the year to 30th June at Â£336,042 (against Â£305,156), thus constituting a fresh high record. There is transferred to reserve Â£50,000 (against Â£32,800) and Â£1,000 again goes to staff fund. The balance to be carried forward is Â£10,603 (as against Â£16,218).

   "text_content" : "Heavy trading in tin marked the re- opening of the London Metal Ex- change yesterday for the first time since the commencement of hostilities. About 800 tons changed hands at prices varying from Â£228 a ton for three months to Â£230 for cash. No dealings were permitted in copper, lead and zinc as arrangements regarding the control and fixation of prices for these metals are still pro ceeding with the Government. COPPER AND LEAD PRICES Cootrary to anticipations, it was not found practicable yesterday to liquidate outstanding contracts for prompts matur- ing since last Thursday, when regular dealings were last permitted on the exchange. This was due to the delay in determining maximum prices. It is under- stood that in official quarters suggestions for maximum prices have been put forward oh the following basis:- Copper Â£ a d Electro wirebars ............. 51 0 0 Best select .......................... 49 10 0 Standard .......................... 46 0 0 Lead Empire (ex ship) ................. 17 0 0 Empire (ex warehouse) ......... 17 12 6 *Foreign (ex ship) ............... 16 12 6 *Foreign (ex warehouse) ...... 17 5 0 Spelter-G.O.B. *Foreign (ex ship) ............... 15 0 0 *Foreign (ex warehouse) ...... 15 12 6 Empire (ex ship) ................ 17 5 0 Empire (ex warehouse) ......... 17 17 6 High grade (ex ship) .......... 18 0 0 High grade (ex warehouse) ... 18 12 6 * Duty for buyer's account. Many metal dealers contend these prices are insufficient. That for electrolytic is considered to be particularly anomalous, as wire bars were quoted at Â£53 10s last Thursday, while spot standard fetched less than Â£45. The executive committee of the London Metal Exchange is keeping in touch with the Government on this sub- ject and an official ruling may be obtained within the next day or two. Once these prices have been fixed it would be possible to close open contracts. ONE SESSION DAILY There is nevertheless a strong feeling among traders that outstanding contracts for copper, lead and spelter should be can- celled and negotiated afresh on the basis of the maximum prices, dealings being, .o far as possible, on a cash basis. Pending settlement of outstanding matters concerning copper, lead and zinc the London Metal Exchange is to be opened for dealings in tin each day from noon to 12.15 p.m."

Platinum has been marked up a further 10s to 185s an ounce. The General Produce Brokers' Associa- tion has cancelled the announcement making the remainder of this week non- business days.
