   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspoundent The Government s enior ministers have agreed that it would almost ertainly be forced to implement Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act if a union's court cae, due to start next Tuesday, goes against the pay standstill. The legal action is the first of a series started by Mr Clive Jenkins, General Secretary of the Association of Supervisory Staffs Executives and Technicians. It is for breach of contract on behalf of an employee of Bristol Siddeley over the implementatiof of a union pay agree- ment, which the company regards as \"frozen\" by the Government's six-month standstill. The Government's view is that the action of Mr. Jenkins-a staunch, very left-wing opponent of its wages policy-could force it into the position of having (reluc- tantly) to activate the compulsory powers of the Act Clearly ministers hope that Mr. Jenkins might withdraw his action or else that the court will find against him. Although no decision has yet been taken by the Cabinet-it met yesterday-senior Ministers have sadly agreed that if ASSET were to win the first of its legal abiions, the Government would have little choice but to activate its powers to control by statutory orders specified wage (and price) levels.

Protection for employers, according to the Government's lawyers, would only be effective from the date of the implemen. tation .qs Part IV. Sonme Ministers believed that if ASSET were to win its first case- even though the employer might appeal against this judgment in Building worker ac the county court- other unions, or even groups of shop stewards, might quickly follow ASSET's example, and resort to litigation. if ASSET wins its first case the Government will clearly be under strong pressure to abandon-how- ever reluctantly-its reliance on the voluntary basis of the wage freeze. It can be confidently stated that the Government would do so with great sorrow. BIt in those circumstances the Government would have no choice but to say to the country that if employer- were not to suffer from the egal consequences of supporting th standstill, the Goverpment-had no- hoice but to givel them that statu- yipy protion :which could be Preferred The Cbinet ndtially .mnet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and by next Thursday it is likely that the ASSBT-Bristol Siddeley case will have been decided one way or the other.

Since net realisations per ton have improved more than costs, the ex pense ratio is lower again and pre tax profits a tenth betteat Â£110m The tax charge, wholly ovieras, remains high at 65.2 per cent. For the rest of the year sales are fore- cast to increase rather faster, by 9 per cent, but renewed Tple\"SuWor product prices in Germsy an Holland indicates mnargins will slide away. However, this could still leave earnings 10 per cent. or so higher, which would make BFPs prospective P/E ratio at 65s 6d a solid 12.4 times. There is no doubt that oil shares are attractive. Profits should climb steadily over the next couple of years, and substantially if sanity ever prevails in prices, which is more than one can say about other industries. And they are a hedge against any rise in the rate of cor- poration tax. The change-over, of course, has been a restrictive fact-or on dividends, but with Â£24m. of overaspill to cushion the impact BP has already forecast an unchanged dividend and so yields 6.2 per cent. Shell now gives a hint of its likely p-ayment for 1966 with an.interim of 10d against the equivalent of 11.9d gross.

The blow this time is that the 10 per cent. divi- dend. the saving grace fr so long, is going to\"e short-earned and whether it is held or not depends \"not only on the profits for the year but also the strength or the Company's revenue rdearv- *nd the prospectsk for the years bhead.\" What this boils down to is the fate of anglish Steel and BAC. Yet there is nothing wreng with profits in the first half. Thoush ailes are down from Â£90.6m. to Â£79.4m. (VC.10 sales dropped from l18m. to Â£3m.) profits before tax nd Interest have risen from \"3.28m, to just under Â£4m. And with nterest charges down, profit* before tax have Jumped sharply from Â£1.64, to sÂ£2.23m. despite *he fact tl$t English Steel must have been dragging its heels. The troubles in the seco d half are Imple, With Pgroe drrowings By LEX of early Â£20m. at the end of last year current nlaterest rates ae DO joke, particularly when borrowings are rising. They are going Up largely because of Bnglish Ste2 and the \" substantial loss \" that will have to be met this year \"on a major commercial shipbuilding contract\" Presumably the BluS Funnel birds are coming home to roost. At 25s 4%d the share price is waiting for two interlinked uncer- taintles to be resolved-whether the dividend will continue and whether English Steel will go. A .avour- able outcome on both counts and the shares will be cheap, Vickers getting its much needed face lif courtesy of the Government. Dunlop Dunlop's fiat half has turned out very much as expected. Sales are up from Â£165m. to Â£171m. and pre-tax profits are slightly higher at Â£8,72m. The prospects for the rest of the year, however, are \"obscured\" by the effects of the freeze. In particular the original equipment side will be hit by the cut-back in car production, and the consumer division cannot be too happy either. But the blow should be offset by two factors-the highly profit- able replacement tyre market should gain from deferred new car purchases, while 55 per cent. of attributable profits last year came from overseas, where, apart from India. markets are grow- ing steadily. It is not unreason- able. therefore, to look for a slightly better second half, as usual, suggesting profits before tax of Â£19m. against Â£18.8m. On the basis of the tax rate for the first half this would give earnings of just over 24 per cent, and put Dunlop at27s 6d on a prospective p/e ratio of 11.3 times with the yield 5.8 per cent Both are reasonable but then a slice of future growth is already spoken for by the convertible. See aso Page 19 EMI's forecast of higher profiti turns out to be a 10 per cent. rise to Â£11 4m. before tax, producina earnings of 23.3 per cent to cover the frozen 15 per cent. dividend, The good work is wholly accounted for by the overseal companies which have improved to the point where they account for 68 per cent. of profits. In the U.K., on the other hand, there was a standstill, partly because of the drop in record sales and partly due the higher r. and d. demanded by the electronics side. The build-up of cash within the group-it was Â£llm. last year- must be continging. At the same time the U.S. shareholding, mostly in small lots, is increasing again, and it is now 15 per cent. Un- doubtedly this interest owes some thing to the change to a 15 per cent. withholding tax.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staff THE GENERAL welcome that the National Farmers Union gave to the Minister of Asrlcultu'res farm policy speech on Tuesday has now received some qualifications. At a Press conference in London yesterday, the NPU's president. Mr. G. T. Williams, said that while welcoming Mr. Peart's assurances about unrestricted credits for farmers the union did not agree that doubts about credit restrictions were not responsible for recent heavy falls in the mar- ket prices for fat and store cattle. sheep and barley. Mr. Williams added: \" We have evidence that in many markets some people whose advantage it would be to buy stock as cheaply as possible have built up these doubts and played up these credit restrictions for their own personal gain.\" The long-term assurances that the Minister gave indicated, Mr. Williams said. that a reasonable increase in farm productivity would be accepted as necessary to improve farming investments. incomes and the standard of liv- ing. \" I am getting more convinced than ever of what the industry can do, not only for .farmers, but for the country as a whole,\" he said. iTere is a better realisation of thi nor only in agriculture but in induatry sad commerce as well. Mr. Williams also said that the change to the pigs subsidy system announced this. wck rMa not the whole answer\" to the present short age of pig for bacon and pork. The chan e scheduled for deet next February. Whet the NFU had sought was an ippediate change 1hich would *have reulted in an effective rise In the guaranteed price of 9d a score. This would have pro. vided compensation for pig producers to put breeding gilts on the markets straight away and thus relieve the immediate shortage. There was no doubt that the bacon curers were in \" serious trouble.\" Mr. \"ll aid. Tre was every sign that te p.g srt9age ould result in home prodt of co being irsufeicIen to meet Britain's quota share of the market agreed In the bacon understandine.\" \"We hope that this will not ieo- pardise outtr situation in the future in any shape or form.\" said Mr. Williams. He added that there was every indication that the Danes would also not hbe able to match up to their obligations under the agreement. Mr. Asher Winegarten, the union's conomist, said that In the first eigh months of this year Britain had paid 10m. more for imported bacon than in the same period last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staff U.S. SOYABEAN prices, still reel- ing under the very much larger than expected Government crop estimate, continue to decline. The Chicago November contract price for soyabeans, now only just above 300 cents a bushel, is some 24 cents below its pre-estimate level and current signs are that it will probably move even lower. The break in values comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its forecast of the current soyabean crop by 10 per cent. to some 925m. bushels. Although the market was aware that prospects had improved, this was still some 35m. bushels more than expected. The result has been a complete turn-round in much market thinking. Bache, for one, now considers that soyabean supplies will be in excess of requirements to the tune of 75m. bushels at current price levels; previously, a very close balance etween production and consumption had been envisaged. But London market sources insist that it is'still too early to discuss the supply-demand equation. The volume of beans needed to meet demand for oil and meal depends upon crush yiplds, something which cannot be determined until after the crop bas I . I Â· Â·Â·. . . I %1 FS - * t I , Ã½ - .. been harvested towards the end of this month. Certainly, dry weather in the early. part of September could adversely affect yields of later-planted beans. The picture should become a little clearer after the October 1 estimate. Meanwhile, exports continue to move well. Soyabean stocks at poits througbout the U.S. have amounted to some 4.7m. bushels since the beginning of the month compared with 2.8m. bushels in the correspond. inM period last year. But this is brtinnsg little cheer to the market. The feeling is that the U.S. Govern. ment may trim back its aid shipments of soyabeans as part of the anti- inflationary drive and by keeping iore beans at home hold down prices. In 'any case, the qualifications attached to the Food for Peace Bill by Congress may well lead to cut. back in the volume of overseas deliveries.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staf AFTER HOLDING steady for most of the summer, sisal prices have shown a sudden downward trend. In the past three days the price of number three long grade has slipped by Â£4 to Â£78 a ton, its lowest point reached earlier in the year. The general picture of a slightly weakened market is rein- forced by the accurmulting stocks in the producing countries, which are \" rather larger than we would like,\" according to a market source. The present situation is now rather different from the outlook in the summer, when, with'falling stocks in producer c6untries and many people buying in early a hardening market was in prospect. Since then, a combination of factors have caused a reversal of sentiment. In August and September demand from the U.S. has been mitigated by the release of 11,000 tons ro the General Services Administration stockpile. This is equivalent to a fifth of the U.S. annual consumption. So far around 3,500 tons. appear to have been sold. Furthermore, U.S. demand for agricultural twine, the chief use of sisal, has been reduced by a lower grain crop. Throughout Europe and elsewhere the rise in interest rates has caused twine spinners to enter a round of de-stocking. In common with many other commodities, this has had a depaessing, albeit only temporary, effect on the market. In addition the barvest, again the chief cause of demand for sisal, is genera late. ePst African sisal mainly from Tanzania and Kenya. has felt a keen draught of competition from Brazilian sisal this summer, which has been selling at very attractive prices. The structure of world sisal prices is cur. rently one of the topics facing a four-day FAO Conference in Rome, and the present downward trend will no doubt be attracting the attention of the newly-formed hard fibres Study Group.",

It certainly begins to look as if oilseed rape may fill the bill. The crop is, tot. new one, inl this country--2Ola to 3.000 acrear'live been grown for seed for many years; and of course leafy types of rape have long been grown. for fodder. often as a catch crop after early potatoes or corn. But until recently the market for rpeseed for crushing has been limited. while a combination of low prices and poor yields have made the crop agticultuaillv unattractive-at least in this country. High Prices Abroad the position has been rather different, In Sweden and in Europe Governments have deliber- ately striven to increase domestic oilseed production, and prices have been kept high. Swedish growers. for instqnce. were getting over Â£60 a ton last year, when the price in this country for rapeseed of a com- parable oil content was only Â£34 to Â£35 a ton. But even the 300,000 acres grown in Sweden are dwarfed by the upsurge of production in Canada, where the acreage reached just on 1.4m. this season. Other large producers are Poland, East Germany and Den- mark. The acreage in France has also been rising quite steeply. With many countries giving their own growers massive protection, the world market price has been basic- ally determined by what the Eastern European countries were prepared to let their stocks so for in their desperate hunt for foreign exchange. But with oilseed prices generally moving briskly upwards over the past year, the price sos imported rapeseed has hardened, and for nesxt year's harvesftmers here ar already being oiff-orand o mown crops than with the sprin: ones which farmers tend to prefer because they are easier to keep free of '.weIdom teir barvest time i f b N lessI likely co ' The earlier lbcropl sown, an the later it is harvested, the higher the oil content usually is.

If yields anything like as good as this at the prices now being noffered by the contract buyers. ar widely achieved in practice-and In Sweden1 600 miles to the north of our maih cereal growing areas the national average yield is 27 cwts an acre, though admittedly most of the crops are winter sown-then rape will begin to look a very attractive proposition indeed. The crop can be sown and harvested with the tackle already available on farms where cereals are grown, though if weeds are to be fully controlled farmers will probably have to dig out a set of steerage hoes from the back of the impie ment shed and put them throung the crop a couple of times. The crushers' attitude towards home-grown rapeseed will be the key to whether the crop eves reaches a substantial acreage in thi country. In the vast rapeoil Ih lies came from India and tended to vary qlity 'a great deaL Constant quality and an oil content of over 40 per cent. is what the crushers prefer. They are used to dealing with shpl*ad of 1,000 tons or upwards at a time, and obviously taking penny parcels from hundreds of farm means extra problems and extra costs for thep. So their endthsiasm is atuerally muted. Untif dentlyt-the only firm crushing rapeseed in quantity in Britain was Premier Mill, Hull. Much of the tape oil 3ent not for human consumption but for svnthetic rubber production and for lubricating marine and jet engines. The largest potential market. though, Is for margarin- manufacture. In Sweden 20 per cent. of the margarine is made 'from rape oil, and there seems to be no reason why a similar propor ton should not be used in this country. Urucic Acid One snag with rape oil, from the marganrine makers' point of view, has been its content of urucic acid. This apparently tends to produce a margarine that doesn't spread well -a serious disadvantage since easy spreadability \"straight from the fridge \"has been one of the main selling points for margarine in competition with butter. For- innately the plant breeders in Sweden and Canada now have pro- duced low-urucic acid varieties of rape, and they are expected to be- come available over here shortly. The other important question is the suitability of the residues for use in animal feedingstuffs. It was long believed by the compounders that rations with more than 10 per cent. of rapeseed cake were un- palatable and possibly even dangerous-but a number of recent trials have shown that this is not the case. and that provided the price is right there appear to be nc immediate limits to the quantiti- the compounders could take up. The attractions of the rape price question is clearly going to depend on what happens to soyabean an- other tropical oilseed prices.",

From November this year the upper limit for payments under the Board's compoational quality scheme will be raised from the present maximum of 13.00 per cent. to 14.50 per cent. total solids. This will mean that 2,600 of the producers whose supplies currently qualify for the top prnmiumr of 3d a gallon above the basic price can earn up to 7Id a allon premium in the new extended quality scale. Milk supplies will be put into 29 class instead of the present 14. The basic price will continue to apply to milk with total solids of 12.00 per cent. but less than 12.10 per cent. For every 0.10 per cent. above thi- class, producers will receive an addi- tion to the basic price of 0.3d per e-Sainw up 4o0 the new upper- lirt. And for every Q.10 per cent. below, to 11.80 per cent. total solids, a de- duction of 0.80d will apply, as at present.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff REPLYING to recent public pleas from Pope Paul VI and UN Secre- tary-General U Thant, the U.S. Administration to-day formally offered to stop the bombing of North Vietnam and withdraw troops from South Vietnam if the Communists took corresponding action. U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, told the UN in New York to-day: \"We do not ask of North Vietnam an uncondi- tional surrender or indeed the sur- render of anything that belongs to it. Nor do we seek to exclude any segment of South Vietnamese people from peaceful participation in their country's future.\" Mr. Goldberg's speech has been widely welcomed in Washington particularly by those Senators who have shown their acute anxiety over -the continual escalation of the war. Senator Mike Mansfield. the Senate Majority leader, said that Mr. Goldberg underscored what the Administration had always held-that it wanted a political rather than a military solution. He particularly praised the Admini- stration for making its offer at the U.N. But there is no sign here that the Administration was acting on any hint that North Vietnam was at present amenable to the offer Mr. Goldberg made to-day, Indeed, at I Press con- tferteie yesterday President Johnson risted that \"we have no indication hat they are interested in sitting down nd talking.\" Officials see Mr. Goldberg's speech a pressing home in the most public orum possible what the President and 4r. Dean Rusk, the Secretary of ate, has been saying for over a year but clearly failing to get across)- hat the U.S. would jump at any vorthwhile offer of talks. After pointing out that the U.S. ad twice paused in its bombing of orth Vietnam-and had not received 'en a whisper of peaceful expres. ons from Hanoi-Mr. Goldberg old the U.N. \"We are prepared to irder a cessation of all bombing of *orth Vietnam, the moment we are ssured privately or otherwise that his step will be answered promptly WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. by a corresponding and appropriate de-escalation on the other side.' On the question of U.S. military occupation of South Vietnam, and of Viet Cong participation in any nego- tiations, Mr. Goldberg repeated what had been stated many times by Administration officials. The U.S. was willing to withdraw from South Vietnam, if possible with U.N. or similar international supervision, Mr. Goldberg maintained. But North Vietnam would have to withdraw its troops as well. Disagreement on the role of the Viet Cong was not \"an insurmount- able problem\" to negotiations, the ambassador insisted. As Senator Mansfield pointed out, President Johnson used almost the same words a year ago in discussing the question of Viet Cong participation.",

   "text_content" : "By Our U.S. Staf GENERAL MOTORS this norn- ag jioined Chrysler Mad Ford in announcing .higher pui*: for its 1967 model cars. Only American Motors bas still'to reveal its new price list and It is expected to fol low .the lead of, ts rivals. SLike it p p- 4p etitors' OM araied that hler a prces were necessary beauise of ety items and other equipment which were being qsad. standard on' next years cars. Porqterly such equip- ment had been optionalh' lowever, the OGM increases will be smaller on average than those of the other companies. Its 1967 models will cost S56 more each ir a range of 529-89. Ford's in- creases will be between S52 and S347 with an average of $112, while those of Chrysler will be in a- 99-359 range. All these increases are now being studied by the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Apparently, the Council was warned a week ago that some price increases were being considered, but was unable to dissuade the companies from implementing in- creases. On past occasions (notably in the cases of aluminium, steel, cigarettes and molybdenwm) the Council has successfully pressed for a rollback of a threatened price increase. But it has also experienced somn WASHINGTON, Sept 22. notable failures-recently over steel prices-iand it has few weapons with which to fight this increase. There have been hints this mornins of a Congressional investigation of the increases. The Senate Commerce Committee-which carried out the car safety investigation that led to the legislation this summer-may hold the hearings next month to determine whether or not the price increases are inflationary and unjustified. Senator Philip Hart. the Michigan Democrat, pointed out to-day that the profits of the \" big three \" were close to a record. He noted that GM's return was 25.8 per cent.. Ford's 15.7 per cent and Chrysler's 14.7 per cent. By comparison, the average of the 500 largest U.S. corporations was 11.8 per cent. If the increases are put into effect, the three companies can certainly expect extremely tough negotiations next year with the United Auto Workers Union whose contracts expire next September. While this is just one of several major contracts expiring next year, it is certain to set a pattern (probably inflationary) for many other indus- tries. Cost of Living Index Up More immediately, the Administra- tion was handed further bad news this morning, when the latest cost of living figures were revealed. In August the consumer price index rose by 0.4 per cent. to 113.8 (100= 1957-1959 average), the Labour Department reported. Prices are now 3.5 per cent. above the level of 4 year ago. Higher prices for food ana for medical services were mainly resm ponsible for the August increase. AA wholesale prices of both farm pro- ducts and processed foods rose con. siderably in August it seems that the upward climb in food prices-which with a very few exceptions has been fairly constant since last November- shows no sign of slackening.",

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff UNION leaders representing over 100.000 employees of General Electric are to meet in Washington next Wednesday to vote on a three year 4 per cent. per year offer from the company. A rejection might well mean a strike since current contracts expire on October 2. Initial reactions to the company's offer have hardly been encouraging. Mr. David Lasser, chairman of a steering committee set up by the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations) to co-ordinate bar gining efforts, said that GE's offer had \"glaring inadequacies.\" A spokesman for the International Union of Electrical Workers-the largest union involved-said that it was \"not good enough.\" Nevertheless, GE's offer was WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. widely regarded as bigger than many observers had expected. This is for a three-year contract, with a 4 per cent. increase in the first year to be followed by two years each with a 3 per cent raise. However, the company argues that an automatic cost of living increase of 2 cents per hour for the last two years brings the overall percentage increase to 4 per cent per year. Increases for workers will range from $8.4 to $22 per week. The 11 unions negotiating with GE are also involved in discussions with Westinghouse Corporation- negotiations which have made very little progress even though con- tracts expire on October 15. But clearly the result of GE's negotia- tions will be closely followed by Westingbouse's.",

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff THE EXPLOSIVE growth in U.S. air travel is already gravely strain- ing airport resources, and may well cause a complete breakdown. Federal Aviation Agency officials are convinced that without a mas- sive increase in Government spend- ing on airports by 1970 the con- gestion will become intolerable. Mr. David Thomas, -Deputy Administrator of the F.A.A., said here that by \"conservative\" estimates, domestic passenger traffic would grow by 111 per cent. between now and 1975, and inter- national traffic on U.S. carriers by 130 per cent. By 1970 the U.S. would need at least 300 airports capable of handling jet equipment: at present there are just over 100 airports. The Air Transport Association, which represents U.S. scheduled airlines; has begun an \"in-depth\" study on the massive problems which the \"jumbo jets\" such as the Boeing 747, which will carry over 400 passengers, will pose to airport. In the past ten years, revenue passenger miles flown on U.S. air- lines have jumped from 19,700m. in 1955 to 51,600m. last year. By current estimates, this figure should jump to 100,000m. by 1970. But airport improvements have not kept pace with this dramatic growth. While requests for im- provements mount in the offices of the, FAA, Congress allows the agency to spend about the same amount each year: the Budget for the last fiscal year provided S71m. to be used with local matching funds for runway and ramp con- struction and improvement By contrast the FAA has now got 130 \"qutt s.or.. OovemiBamot help pending, which total $250m. WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. Officials reckon that Government spending of at least S150m. a year over the next five years will be necessary to prevent a massive crisis-but they see little hope of Congress giving that much. At the moment, for example, O'Hare Airort at Chicago takes 520,000 landings and take-offs each year-and at peak periods aircraft are landing or taking of every twenty seconds. Delays in the air are getting longer-last year at Newark Airport, one of three airports serving New York City, 42.7 per cent. of all incoming flights were delayed. Airlines lose in two ways: first, they cannot offer the faster service they should with jet equipment (many schedules between Eastern cities are no quicker than those of -15 years ago). Secondly, the costs of taxi-ing in line before take-off and of circling, while permission to lnds awaited, are staggring.. The PAA reckons that last year, this cost U.S. airline S63.em.",

   "text_content" : "The Annual General Meeting of PERROSIAAL AG was held in Esses on June 28, and the follow- ing are details from the speech of DR. V. MmaOgn. Chairman of the Board of Managemept, as well as extracts from the repgort presented by the Board. It was Dr. v. Menges' last speech in this capacity as, from July 1, he is taking over from Dr. Reusch as Chairman of the Gutehofnungshlttte Board. At FERROSTAAL, his successor is Mr. Werner Delvendabl who has been a full Board Member since 1960. Dr. v. Meuee After welcoming his successor Dr. von Menges spoke of the Government's proposed Economic Stabilisation Law. He said the necessity. for.it must reluctantly be accepted. Public exoenditure must be brought into balance. The private sector is will- ing to make sacrifices for this pur- pose although it is emphatically not prepared to bear the whole burden. The present all out pursuit of technical progress will have to be modified and this comes at a time when competitors, particularly in the U.S.A., are having their development expenditure boosted by enormous defence orders. Ger- man industry can face this problem but only if the Government gives it a fair crack of the whip. The consolidation phase must be com- pleted quickly in both the -public and the private sector, and there- after an efficient money market must be created. The present tendency towards co-operation and larger industrial units is primarily a response to the poor state of the home market. The same cause makes it neVessary to nurse export markets through the present financial dificulties so that they may be still available when better conditions return. The num- ber of foreign shipbuilding orders which have been lost in recent years because of financing prob- lems gives reason to wonder how long this can be kept up, especially as the time will come when the whole : American production capacity, which the Vietpam war has so vastly inflated, will be un- leashed on world markets. During the year under .review, trade with .East Germany, and with East Bloc countries generally, improved further. Great value is laid on restoring close relations with these traditional markets. Valuable business is increasingly being won in Africa and Asia but South America continues to be of most importance in Ferrostaal's overseas operations. As that Con- tinent approaches relative political stability, business activity increaaes, Both Argentine &nZ Brazl.- have. favourable trade balances so that they should begin to accept psore imports. The following are details from the report:- The Rport. In general 1965 was reasorlably satisfactory for the German economy but growth slowed in- creasingly during the year. The demand for capital goods, which had boosted the economy In 1964. fell off progressively and there was no further compensatory growth in demand for exports. FERROSTAAL had sufficient orders for investment goods to enable It to Increase Its turnover slightly in spite of these eircum- stances. At DM 985m it reached its highest level yet. The decline in domestic demand affected sales of Iron and steel. he Company and its subsidiarie were together able to raise both total turnover and their share of the German market for rolled steel but competition forced pric- down. Profits from this sector were therefore reduced. German iron exports wre= generally higher than in 1964, as a result of Increased sales to third countries. FERROSTAAL also recorded sUlihtly reduced sales to the ECSC but higher exports to third countries. Profit margins continued to narrow. The techcal epartments con- tinued tob Nllteinloyed durin- 965. The very hirlea level of the Iprsvious lea bad been deter- mined by a concentration of oom- pleted lrgeaeale orders. In 1965, the value hs tales booked declined slightly, alhough the orders for mediiat. sized plant which th-- Company has been going after for some yers .to-some extent r- dressedthe balance. The Company's business thus rested dn a rather wider basis than hitherto. Profits were reasonable in this sector. Rs\"r tICred\" The rising interest rate in Ger many is a great burden for exporters. The fact that. the bank rate has been raised three times has combined with the shortage of available capital to raise interest rates beyond the level at which international competition allows the extra cost to be passed on to the customer. Almost all competing foreign exporters have access to cheaper credit than the Germans and the position is made worse by rising manufacturers' costs in Germany. The results of this have shown up plainly in the 1965 trade figures. The West German surplus of DM 1,200m compares badly with DM 6.000m in the preceding year and it was the lowest for 14 years. Although this set-back is largely accounted for by the rise in imports, it must be noted that the growth of exports has remained almost unaltered at 10 per cent for the last two years. At this rate exports cannot balance the deficit items which totalled DM 6.000m. in the 1965 Balance of Payments. The restrictive policies of the Federal Bank have reached their safe limit and need rethinking. Last year's economic develop- ments were less favourable than those of 1964 for the developing countries which provide FERRO- STAAL with its chief market.' This forces them to cut imports and thus leads to fiercer competition for the few remaining orders. 1'Net , t- tax, ot of 6M 4.26.04 6 wa* tiutsferrs t6 th parent company.

ESW LL rCA took .ili following are extracts. from hee report of the Board of Manage ment: Reiylew During the year unider review prices for raw and auxiliary materials for the steel ndustry were steady and this applibd both to ore and scrap. Less scrap had to be imported from third countries which meant that costs were lowered and the reduced require. ments of the foundries had the same effect for cast metal and cupola furnace scrap. For non-forrous metals, the growth rate of the previous year was not repeated. New rolling mills for aluminium effooted prices and, despite an unchanged 6filcial trice for the crude metal and higher costs, the price of aluminium semis reached a ne- low. Copper prices rose in irregular bursts. Strikes and political un. certainty pushed the ordinary quotation for cash settlement for wire bari on the L.M.E. to the recordt lael of Â£790. Comrstition was rossly disturbed by differences in producer price, and by the vary. ins aesees to reasonably priced copper enjoyed by the. various users Lead prices settled early and the previous year's boom In zinc did not continue.

The High Authority of the European Coal awd Steel CatUlnpaity to-day started a series of aietlagp at Milniterial level with the member Govieaeats the hope of ecridag agreement on comos m enues l tW, deal with the oCputuunlty's growing steel and coal surplas. To-day a negotiating committe on the problems of coking coal had talks with the Luxembourg Government, and next week will meet M. Marcellin, French Ministry of Industry, with the aim of resuscitating the High Authority's plan for a Community subsidy for coking coal. This plan, which would mainly benefit high-cost German producers against the competition of cheap American coking coal, was rejected by the French Government in July. The French refused to accept the plan, on the grounds that it is not expressly called for by the Paris Treaty, but in reality they were objecting both to the cost of sub- sidising German producers and to a system of Community financing which would enhance the position of the High Authority. The main fear of the High Authority is that in the absence of Community measures the member Governments will take separate national steps to meet the coal and steel surplus and thus move further away from an integrated market for these, products. If M. Marcellin maintains his opposition. Signor Del Bo, President of the High Authority, is expected to press his case personally with M. Michel Debrd. French Economics Minister. In fact some national measures have already been taken in the member States or are under prepara- tion. The German steel industry has drawn up a plan for four sales cartels, and in the absence of Community measures may receive a coking coal subsidy from the German Govern- ment. It is also reported that similar steps are under consideration in Belgium, while in France the Govern- ment has already agreed the lone-term plan with the steel industry, including cheap finance for modernisation and investment. The High Authority has still not decided under what conditions it would authorise the German steel cartels, and will only discover the real details of the French Govern- ment's steel plan next Wednesday when French officials visit Luxem- bours. The Council of Ministers of the ECSC scheduled for next Tuesday has therefore been postponed.",

This year's output of cars and estate cars up to the end of August was 1,859,700 vehicles or 6.7 per cent. better than in the first eight months of last year. Growth in the commercial vehicles sector was rather less fast, so that the indus- try's overall output was up by only, if that is the right word, 5.8 per cent, to 2,011,900 vehicles. Exports, almost stationary in 1965, are once again growing fast. They were up 6.2 per cent. to 1,024,600 units and the outlook is continuing fair.

   "text_content" : "I THE SWEDISH SCENE By Our StockholbCormpondent THE SWEDISH labour situation is now so tight that virtually the only ntapped market that remains is iomen, and 'particularly married women. Out of a population of ust over 7.5m.; nearly 4m. are gainfully esmployed, this total already includes about Im. women, if whom' approximately 44 per cent. are married. According to one estimate, by 1970 every second married woman 'n Sweden will be gainfully employed. Each year the proportion of married women at work is increas- ng, and recent legislation which allows women to work on night shift in the pulp and paper mills highlights the seriousness of the labour shortage. Already about 14 t -cent. of the operators on Volvo's production lines are women, and women can be seen iperating cranes, trucks and acting as one- woman bus crews in the cpital. Of course, with the steady in crease of women at work, both in industry and the professions, their status has received quite a boost. But in spite of early emancipation hey still have to battle against the feeling of male superiority in most obs, coupled with an attitude that most women are not decision makers. Big Breakthrough The major breakthrough in women's status in business was probably marked earlier this yzar by Svenska Handelsbanken's appointment of a woman director -ihe first woman bank director in Scandinavia-Mrs. Elsa Nygren, a jolly and ebullient 50-year-old. In Sweden it must be explained that there are different levels of direc tor, the top ones being on the B:oard and the others carrying ou; senior management and executive jobs, such as Mrs. Nygren's. Mrs. Nygren's precise job is almost impossible to define, but her department has 30 secretaries in it who work for the Board of directors and is called \"Direck- tionssekreterare.\" In spite of this imposing title she is not confined to looking after a lot of secretaries, but with the management of a number of the bank's internal functions, such as arranging dinners for VYIP guests and remem' bering important customers' birth* days, and above all keeping the work flowing smoothly in the directors' department The external image of the Bank, pqrticularly where women are concerned, is also her respon* sibility. Handelsbanken has banished staid old bankers' gloom, \\and most of the 480 branches all over the country have had a face- lift. bringing them right up to date both in architecture and furnish- ings. The Bank is also very conscious that the walls, both of the Head Office in Stockholm and Mrs. Elsa Nygren its branches should be used effectively, not for advertising the Bank's services but works of art. Altogether Handelsbanken has well over 4,000 paintings in its collec- tion scattered throughout the country on its banks' walls. In the main these are modern paintings by contemporary artists, both Swedish and foreign. All the paint- ings in the Head Office are by Swedish artists, while the branches have a mixture, usually chosen by the local manager. To stimulate interest in art among the Bank employees, HIandelsbanken runs a lottery twvce a year for a number of paintinga. To participate costs Kr.3 (4s ld) per loonth and Mrs. Nygren says it is very popular, last year one winner got a signed Picasso litho. graph, which was a good return on his modest outlay. Mrs. Nygren's office has the usual modern aids to communica- tion-four telephones on her desk and a dictating machine-but there the resemblance to the traditional banking image ends. Stacked in a corner more like an artist's studio are some 20 to 30 pictures she keeps in stock. \"Just in case,\" she says, \"one of the managers visits me and wants a new picture for his branch.\" And a typical feminine touch is the wide window ledge running the full lenhth of her office which is covered with dozens of plants and fowers. Untapped Market With women taking a greater part in business and industrial affairs, it is natural that the Bank should look upon them as a vir- tually untapped market as cheque account customers. To tap this market. Mrs. Nygren runs a \"Golden Weekday Club,\" which has regular meetings in the pro- vinces where the Bank has its branches-so far there have been over 50. The approach is definitely a soft sell, and it includes a lunch, dress shows, home management budgeting and usually a talk by Mrs. Nygren on how the housewife and working girl can use a bank to her advantage. The visitors all get a letter from Mrs. Nygren as a follow-up. After 30 years in the Bank, Mrs. Nygren knows everybody from the chairman down to the janitor, and being raised to the status of director has not made any difference, particularly to the efficient running of her behind-the- scenes Boardroom activities. This week she is off on another \"Golden Weekday\" trip, and when she announced her departure the Board told her not to be away too long. \"When I am away,\" she says, \" they feel rather like chickens without the hen.\"",

Group trading profits rose to Â£3,760,879, profits before taxation to Â£2,363.530, and net profits to Â£1,648,252. The sales turnover was approximately Â£150,000,000, of which 16.8 per cent, was inter-Group sales. A thee figures are the best yet achieved, and are specialIly-satisfactory as this has been a difficult and testing yearlagely through causes beyond our control such as Iresoes Vi the cost of vehicle licences, fuel tax and National ;Ilin. e t contributions amounting to nearly Â£200,000 in a full year.

Arrangements ihave been made with Bellmans to market textiles in certain of our own supermarkets. We are optimistic that these acquisi- tio&s will contribute satisfactorily to our results. , Our policy continues to be that of expansion by encourag- -ing the internal growth of our companies and the acquisition qs businesses allied to our present activities, or operating in fields in which we possess knowledge and experience. Trends and Problems It is difficult to forecast the results of the current year as there are so many unknown factors. The price of meat has risen considerably with a detrimental effect on our meat distribution and our meat canning and manufacturing opera- tions.. The seamen's strike has increased our difficulties and affected our ships' stores business. The long-term effects of the strike are yet to come. The new Meat and Livestock Commission will undoubtedly infuence the whole pattern of meat trading as its finances will, in the main, be met by a levy on all animals slaughtered for meat in Great Britain and thereby impose a further burden on the trade. The present pig population is inadequate to meet the demands of the industry, and as a consequence raw material prices are likely to remain high. Forecasts from well-informed sources indicate there is not likely to be an appreciable improve- ment until early in 1967. The proposed Payroll Tax will be a heavy burden, parti- cularly on companies which operate on a small margin of profit. It is notable that the possible results of what appears hasty legislation will leave many anomalies regarding the effect on companies whose operations are partly manufacturing and partly distribution. It is probable, however, that the ultimate results must be increased prices and render progress in busi- nesses more difficult to achieve. Fortunately our Group's interests are well diversified and many of our divisions are well placed to minimise the effects of the difficulties confronting us. Our sales turnover shows an increase over last year and should help to combat rising expenses. We are riot allowing our anxieties to hinder our long-term planning nor to undermine our confidence in our Group.

( In the course of his statement Tie RiorT HONOuaAa LORD < MILnms OP LEDe, P.C.. Chairman of tho Compay, 4a14:- Ths year u review wa one of transition; durFig which we carried out the tremkendous aask of moving our headqurters from London to the country. We also introduced . major administrative changes in accord with tie broader concept of cor ndence train- ing that emerged from oial reappraisal of this teaching medium. During the removal process our resources were strained to maintain our normal service to our existing students and accordingly, we con- sidered it imperative to limit the acceptance of new student con- tracts. The result of the removal is that we have set up an organisation geared to expansion on sound and economic lines, but during the pressure of change, additional costs had to be accepted fromn many directions which,. together with the drop in income., resulted in profits being reduced. In the event, the Group's profit was Â£77,258. com- pared with, Â£102.221 in the pre- vious year. I The sale of our leasehold interest in College House produced a sur- plus beyond, the Balance Sheet value. The -nett surplus was Â£64.000 which was more than suffi- cient to meet the ion-recurring costs of our removal to Alder- maston Court. - After tax the amount available for distribution .to Shareholders has increased from Â£41.246 last year to Â£51,090. The Final Dividend of 3 % per cent. makes a total of 10 per cent. for the year. The Group's carry forward of unappropriated profits has increased from Â£156,000 to Â£172.000. Current assets now exceed current liabilities by more than Â£560,000, compared with some Â£350.000 iu the previous year. Instruction It is generally recognised in' the fast-changing economic, social and industrial conditions of to-day, that there must be a wide and proges- sive extension of adult education in nearly every department of learning-with some special em- phasis on scientific and technical subjects and on retraining pro- grammes that will enable workers to adapt their knowledge to new techniques. It is against this back- ground that we have centred the Group's educational interests on Aldermaston Court and several of our correspondence colleges are already operating entirely from there. The intention is that Alder- maston Court shall make a signifi- cant and practical contribution in the field of adult education. Em- ploying 'correspondence courses as a basic ingredient. the centre will seek to apply approved and varied techniques of education including Seminars. Weekend Courses. Summer Schools. Educational Tours, Audio-Visual Aids. Pro- Srammed Instruction, Language Laboratories and Instructional Kits.

Housed in a modern school building, its facilities dispense with the inflexible classroom system and the lengthy interruptions induced by enforced holidays between terms. Through the Language Laboratory we are offering a valu. able community service and in terms of enrolments the response has been encouraging. Nearly 30 npr cent. of current fee income is from re-enrolment of old students -the best compliment the tutors can be paid. We are now planning to receive overseas visitors, and to provide suitable accommodation with English families where our students from overseas will be given an opportunity of enjoying the English way of life and direct language practice. ne opening of further labora- tories is under active consideration. Retail Bookselling The turnover of Claude Gill Books Limited increased by some 30 per cent. during the year, but staffing costs rose by over 25 per cent, the increase being strongly marked in the second half of the year. The result was that profits, espite increased sales, varied little from the previous year. Business continues on the up- grade, but we face particular prob- iems in the matter of the Selective Employment Tax, as we cannot absorb this unexpected charge with. out help from publishers by way of higher trade discounts. Never- theless, we remain convinced that our bookshop, with a turnover which should soon be approaching the half million a year mark, will provide adequate returns. Paper Converatg and Priting Despite an increase in turnover, the profit of Metropolitan Paper Works declined due largely to special wage awards and the cost or providing increased annual holidays. Steps have been taken to improve output and margins by offering attractive incentive schemes to the staff and by utilising the most modern production methods. Andrew Merryfield Turnover of our mail order divi- sion Increased, but profits felt Broadly speaklhg, gross margins were more than maintained, but they still fell short of offsettin- mounting expenditure arisin- mainly from increases in advertis. ing space rates, salaries and postage.

As I mentioned ast year that substantial increase was attributed to some extent to the incidence 6f abnormal divi. dends received prior to 6th April, 965. A similar situation, to which I refer later, arose in the year under review which benefited o the extent of some Â£27,000 before tax. splicatlosm of 1965 Flnance Act The many implications of the inance Act 1965, so far as In- vestment Trust Companies are oncerned, are now becoming more clear. Double Taxation Con. entions are being re-negotiated ad the result will be that we shah not, after the year now current, get relief for United Kingdom taxation purposes in respect of tax paid by Overseas Companies in which we have invested. Certain Companies took advantage of the provisions of the 1965 Act to pay dividends before 6th April, 1966, ad thus to avoid the necessity to ccount to the Revenue for the ax deducted, which dividends might otherwise have been received by us after the close of our year on 31st May, 1966. Last year we had Â£138,025 on Deposit in United States Invest- nent Dollars. This Deposit was up-lifted and the proceeds have been Invested partly in America and Canada and partly in United Kingdom Fixed Interest Stocks. Switching of investments in America and Canada is penalised n that, if the amount invested here is to be maintained, a proe mium is payable in respect of the 25% of the sale proceeds which is surrenderable to the Bank of England. It will be noted that the percentage in Fixed Interest Stocks n the United Kingdom has in- creased from 4.51 to 6.54.- Other- wise there has been little change during the year in the broad classi- ication of our investments. We are recommending a final dividend of 10% on the Ordinary Shares. making a total for the year of 16%, the same as last year. It s envisaged that the income for the year to 31st May, 1967, win be appreciably reduced but the Direc- tors would hope to maintain the 6% dividend although the percen age of distribution to availabie ncome will certainly be consider ably higher than the present 78.9%.

OuI coastwise coal shipments showed ,an improvement during the year. The sales of solid fuel on the in. land market have been reasonably well maintained, but there have been losses due to closures and conversion to other fuels. This competition is strongest in the Thames area and linked with the decision of the National Coal Board to apply selective price in- creases on coals from the shipping Divisions which are the mainstay of our seaborne industrial business, clearly sets a limit to the life of London coal-discharging wharves. Trading on the oil side of our business continued at a good level. The cargo activity in particular showed a substantial improvement as a direct result of a considerable increase in the tonnage of crude oil shipped to South America. Our inland oil activities continue to make progress, despite intense competition, which resulted in generally lower margins. Marine Division: (26%: 14%) The policy of disposing of the older units in the collier fleet has continued, largely because of the decline in seaborne coal. Operat- ing costs continued to rise, princi- pally as a result of increases in seamen's wages, in port charges and in repair costs. Part of the improvement in profits of this Division is due to the policy of disposing of those deep-sea tankers which we had been trading on the open market. The first specialised vessel owned by Liquid Gas Tankers Limited, a company in which we participate, came into service during the year. R. & J. H. Rea Limited has con- tinued with the modernisation of its tug fleet at Cardiff and Barry by the introduction of five new diesel tugs. Steady progress has been made in the volume of work handled at Avonmouth, Cardiff, Barry and Milford Haven. Cory Mann George Division: (11%: 10%). The Central Africar Group maintained the very satis factory result achieved last vear, but the impact of the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Indepen dence was not felt by the date on which these overseas companiec ended their year. Thie profits in South Africa weri slightly down, partly through the initial cost of new interests, whick include opening up a charterinj department in Johannesburg and a new office in East London. Soutk West Africa had another good year A new office in Luderitz has beer opened. Wharfage and Lighterage Division (12%: 18%). The continued con traction in seaborne coal tonnagi has led to a further decline in thi revenue of our Thames and Med way bulk discharging wharves.

The lease of ou Albert Dock coal discharging jett! and installation is nearing termina tion, and arrangements for relin quishment are being studied. 1 large modern plant for the hand ling and processing of sea-dredgs aggegates has been installed at ou Rochester Wharf.

Whilst I am anxious not to ninimie this achievement, I feel everthele-s that it is necessary o sound a note of caution because f the unsettled state of the cnomy which leaves the future ill more uncertain, not knowing wbat further taxes are likely to e imposed which will penalize ronts. In the current year we shall feel be full effedts of the new systeim f Corporation Tax and Income ra on Dividends and we are also aced with the additional burden f the Selective Employment Tax, which will cost the Group pproximately Â£27,500 per annum. ihis tax has been widely criticised ad we in the Insurance field are specially bard hit, bearing in imnd the value of the \"hidden :port\" of Insurances and the esultant dollar and other currency ernings. Meehailsatm of udlness Procedures For some time past we have pur- med a forward-looking policy, not rily in the acquisition of addi- rional business, but also in \" tailor- n \" our systems so as to econo. miae on the massive amount of. =iterwork whi*l our particular Instry involves. Whilst we have already partially mechanised our systems. we hope that early ln 1957, we shall have an 1.C.T. 1901 Computer installed in our Cate- ham office, which will help towards greater efficiency .nd speedy service to our clients sad towards a more productive urs c manpower. All Member-Compases of the Group will be aligning their procedures, whilst following a policy of integration wherever pos- -ible. Our income is preponderantly from brokerage as distinct 'fror underwriting, so we are not to any great extent adversely affected by deteriorating underwriting results, including the effects of catastro phes such as Hurricane \"Betsy.\" Consequent unon these misfortunes there has been a general revision of premium rates. During the current year the busi. nesses of our Brighton associates are being merged into L. Hammond a& Co. (Southern) Limited, and we are hopeful of further develop* ments through this new medium. Our management and staff every- where are to be congratulated upon their contribution to these favour- able figures and it is with pleasure that I offer them my thanks..

The annouuaement, broadcast by Baghdad Radio following a throehou& meeting of the Iraqi Cabinet, said that the nine-man committee will advise the Government on the best way to exploit Iraq's \"huge oil serves,\" and will reactivate the Iraq National Oil Company. IThe statement speeAically said that the committee should conduct its work within the framework of Law No. 80 of 1961, \"and away from politics.\" It. will have its headquarters at the offices of the National Oil Company. Law No. 80 was issued by the late Premier Abdel Kerim Kassem, after the failure of negotiations with the Iraq Petroleum Company and associates in Iraq. Under the law the Government seized 99 per cent of unexploited concession areas. To exploit these areas Kassem established the National Oil Company, but successive Gov- ernments did little or nothing to develop the areas, since IPC never recognised the Law. The National Oil Company also remained dormant. Last year the Cabinet of Premier Taher Yahya reached a draft agre. ment with IPC and associates, for a joint venture by the companies and the National Oil Company in those parts covered by Law No. 80 which nad proven reserves. The agreemeni, however, was never endorsed as it rrn into -opposition from Arab nationalist and leftish elements who argued that it in effect cancelled Law No. 80. It will be the main purpose of the committee formed yesterday to con. sider this draft agreement and probably to propose w negotiations. The committee includes the Minaser of Finance, Dr. Abdullah al Nakshabandi; the Industry Minis. ter, Khalid al Shawi; and the Central Bank Governor, Saleh Kobbah. But two other appointments appear to be more significat-Baba Alt and Adib al Jader. Baba Ali is a Kurd, highly respected by the insurgents under Mulla Mustafa Barzani. His appointment is apparently to please the Kurds, who demand a fair share of the country's oil income, since the oil reserves are deposited In their areas. Jader is known to be a staunch supporter of Cairo and was one of the architects of the Socialist measures applied in Iraq in 1964. He has previously served as Central Bank Governor and as President of the Economic Organisation which was supervising all nationalised companies. He was removed from these two posts last year after falling out with the late President Abdel Salam Ares. The Economic Organlsation was cancelled by the former Premier, Dr. Bazzaz.",

Barzani is quoted as complaining that the Government is doing noth- ing to carry out Dr. Bazzaz's twelve- point programme for peaceful settlement of the Kurdish prob- lem. The programme provides for granting the Kurds national rights by giving them local rule on the BEIRUT, Sept. 22. basis of the decentralisation of government administration. But reports from Kurdish sources in Iraq say that the drafts prepared by the Bazzaz Cabinet to make the provisions of the Kurdish plan law, are gathering dust on the shelves of the Premier's office. They say that those army officers who were influential in removing Bazzaz from power are now opposed to giving the Kurds their rights. Barzani is also deeply annoyed by new Government tactics where- by his Kurdish opponents are be- ing supplied with.

More serious is his charge that the Portuguese are allowing mer- cenaries to gather in Angoli, just across the frontier from Katanga, with a view to organising a second Katangese secession master- minded by Mr. Tshombe. The Congo has now complained to the UN Security Council of a \" danger to world peace,\" and has stopped all air traffic with Angola. If Mr. Tshombe is planning a come-back, it is by no means certain whether he wants to re- emerge in Katanga-with a view to extending his reign from there by stages to the rest of the coun- try-or to return to the post of Prime Minister of the whole Congo in Kinshasa (Leopoldville), from which he was ousted a year ago. The mercenaries originally re- cruited by Mr. Tshombe when he was Prime Minister, to put down the left-wing rebellion, have been reduced from 1,500 to 500, but they still play a key part in main- taining security. However, some of them, in league with the Katangese \"gendarmes,\" mutinied at Kisangani (Stanleyville) in July, and the situation there is still un- dean although Mr. jangema claims it is back to namal. But Mr. Tshombe's pqrtion in atantg has been w ened by he removal of his right-ead man, Mr. OGdatroid Munoag frtom the overnorship f East Katat. He may 'therefore make a bid tso on Neat \"the r not bosyr as a ility rte noe hand, titht sado a deal withe cnbe This is where the i cme Mr. Moise Tshombe in. President Mobutu has got him- self on to visiting terms with reputable African leaders such as President Kaunda and President Nyverere by being beastly to the Belgians, who had expected him to be almost as co-operative as Mr. Ishombe. But now he seems to have decided that he cannot afford to have both the Belgians and Tshombe against him-though it is not at all clear to what extent his two main adversaries are in league with one another. He has just sent nis Foreign Minister, Justin Bomboko-who has amazingly occupied his post almost uninter- rupted since 1960-on a secret mission to Brussels to talk to everyone from the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister downwards, and a new agreement may be in the offing. The contenteux between the two countries is unbelievably tor.- uous. It arises' ot of the fact that Leopold II ran Belgium and the Congo ar-sparate Sats; after. his death the two were ohly' par- tally linked together financially on the standard colonial pattern; but at independence they had to be unscrambled again, with little eal understanding of who should own what While the Congo is try- in to assert its economic indepen- dence in the face of massive Bel. gium public and private financial nterests, the.Belgians are trying to salvage as much as they can from the resources of men and money nwhich they have invested in the Congo. : here is also the more immediate political factor that the last, and paretly final, agreement be- ween lgi and the Congo was between Mr. Tshombe and ?M. Spaak, then Belgian Foreign Minis- ter, in February 1965. Both men ;re now out of office, and Presi- dent Mobutu is accusing Mr. Tshombe of having sold Congolese interests down the.river, while the Belgians have been talking of cutting off aid. In the words of Mr. Lengema's memorandum: 'The Belgians managed to make Mr. Tshombe. who was always sensitive to persuasion, accept a text which he did not hesitate to sian. These agreements embodied the subordination and despoliation of the Congo.\" The Tshombe-Spaak agreement has, however, held good on some points. The Congo has grudgingly accepted the debt share-out; the Congo takes on its own interna debt, and Belgium that part of the external debt which it had guaran- iteed; the unguaranteed external debt has beenisplit. 60 per cent. for the Congo, 40 per cent. for Belgium. There is also a modus vivendi on Union Miniere, with the Congo getting its shareholding of some 25 per cent. of the voting power and directors on the Board-but one of them, Mr. Jean-Baptiste Kibwe. is an old associate of Mr. Tshombe and inother-is half. brother of Mr. Munongo. President Mobutu wanted Union Minibre to move its headquarters back from Brussels to Kinshasa-they were moved out of the Congo just before independence-but will apparently be content with an operating sub- sidiary housed in a new skyscraper symbolising Congolese unity. The company has been technically de- prived of its unexploited concession areas by the \" Bakajika law.\" It is likely, however, to get *most of them back again, although there are reports that a Japanese iron ore company is moving in. The main difficulty now concerns the jortfolio of Congolese Govern- ment shares in a number of public enterprises. The Congolese comr plain that Mr. Tshombe's famous rief-case, that was supposed to contain their shares, only in fact held letters requesting Belgium to hand them over-and in some cases they are still in Belgian hands for sovcalled \"technical\" reasons. The situation has become some. what farcical The Belgians have Joseph Mobuto taken over eight buildings in Brussels as their share of the assets of OTRACO, the Congolese National Transport Office, and so the Congolese have taken over eight similar SABENA buildings in Kinshasa. The Congo has dis- solved the Forminibre diamond company, in which it held 55 per cent. of the shares, because the Belgians would not hand the shares over and had hived off many of the assets into a new subsidiary. So the Belgians called an extra- ordinary company meeting and dis- possessed the Congo of its shares. The prospect now is that all these difficulties may be settled by a top-level conference. But it is hardly a good moment for Presi- dent Mobutu to come to Brussels, in view of the mercenaries' threat, and the Belgians seem reluctant to send King Baudouin-his opposite number as Head of State-into the ring against him. No doubt it will all be patched up sooner or later. The question is whether Mr. Tshombe will by then have made his come-back. F>. \" ' * *",

   "text_content" : "By Our Shipping' Correspondent The Canard Steam-Ship group- --developing its new Image s a salesman of pleasure resorts afloat rather than point-to-ponlt travel in ships-Is to cooperate next year with British European Airways on a new kind o holiday, designed by Cunard to meet the demand for sterling holidays. Next February, Cunard Line will base its 22,000-ton passen- ger liner, Sylvania, at Gibraltar as the starting point for a series of spring cruises in the Mediterranean. Passengers will be brought to the ship by BEA aircraft chartered by Cunard and after the cruise they will fly back again by BEA to london. Passengers who want to stay on in Gibraltar, which is in the sterling area. before or after the cruise, can use the normal BEA scheduled services to extend their holiday and still include the cruise portion. A big advantage in the Cunard scheme is that BEA. on flights to Gibraltar, can offer fares which are below the schedules laid down by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The Sylvania will .carry between 500 and 550 passengers on cruises from Gibraltar. Cunard Line's passenger director. Mr. John Burkart. said yesterday: \" This is a new kind of holiday which overcomes currency restrictions. Working with BEA in this way, we can visit a wider range of Mediter- ranean ports and still provide more time ashore. \"Cunard intends In future to be firmly in new developments in the holiday business, and we expect to include further use of air services in our holiday programmes,\".said Mr. Burkatt. The Cunard Line is extending its cruise programme it 1967 to 30 cruises from U.S. ports, comared with 25 this year. There will be 12 cruises by. Cunard from European ports compared with 10 this year. Cunard also announced yesterday that the two \"Queen\" liners, the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary, will .mate 11 calls at Cobb in the Irtish Republic during 1967. This will be the first time the world's two liners will have visited Ireland. calls by the \"Queens\" at Cobb will be \"slotted'. into the rteular weekly transatlantic sailings between Southampton. Cherbourg and New York, without affecting the normal 5-day transatlantic crossing by the \"Queens.\" Cunard expects the calls at Cobh to generate more pas- enger business.",

Recrtmdnat' is difficult enough, and retaining theyoung- sters for any length of time can be even more of a problem. If, hpwever, a sales assistai'i job takqs on the look of a caireer, supported by appropriate train- ing programmes, it will be a much more attractive proposi- tion. There are multiples and de- partment stores which have been training for many years. Indeed, they have provided the trained labour pool for their competitors. Although these companies have been training- conscious all along, even they are now stepping up their efforts in many directions. They know only too well that with rising costs, SET, and re- stricted consumer spending, it is the competence of the sales assistant which attracts the customer. Till Drill. The Debenham group, with 120 stores up and down .the country, and a total payroll of about 30,000, has a two- year indentured apprenticeship scheme for the 15-year olds. For the first week or so the apprentices receive classroom training. They get acquainted with their store. learn the till drill, learn to make out sales bills, how to answer the tele- phone, and so forth. Then, un- der the eye of an elderly assis- tant, the \" sponsor,\" the girls and boys follow a planned pro- gramme of three-monthly stays in various departments. At the end of the two years the' apprentices are auto- matically merged with the next intake, the \"A\" level school leavers, and together they are now termed junior manage- ment trainees. Instruction con- tinues, coupled with day re- lease to college for the two-year course leading to the National Retail Distribution Certificate. There is an internal, cere- monious merit award once the certificate has been obtained. When they are about 19 years old, apprentices and \"A\" level trainees alike may be given their first responsibility for run- ning a department, while by the age of 21 they could be made assistant sales managers, depart mental sales managers, or con- trollers. This is about as far as women tend to go, but the men may well one day sit in the managins director's chair. At Marks and Spencer there is no distinct differentiation between the school leaver and other \"entries.\" In every case (Marks and Spencer has some 22,000 sales staff, about half of them under 20)\" we are looking for M & S types,\" which means particularly careful selection. Everyone has to pass a simple arithmetic test, and must prove that she is able to converse. Once accepted, the newcomer is introduced in the usual fashion to the company and the job, to the prevailing rules and regula- tions, and is taught to take pride in the merchandise she sells. The initial six-week training programme consists of learning ihe job on the job, under the control oUf the departmental supervisor and, an experienced sales assistatit There are off- ihi-foor disciasiooi, there are upporting trainipg materials in ihe form of lea1ets, or film siides.

Soon it is not \"just the sock counter, but her- ock counater.\", Promotion Chance What is more, \"every store is a college,\" they claim at M & S --consequently there is little day-release to outside colleges at the moment, although M & S is experimenting with this too. For the moment, however, \" the training the girls require is what we can tell them.\" Every entrant is thus individually and pur posely developed, given insight into this and that, and possibly elevated to departmental super visor after two years to deal with \"a six-figure turnover\" there are 1,300 such jobs in the organisation. Once chosen as a. supervisor trainee, the girl, visibly distin- guishable by a white collar, also has two-day company courses, ' a pooling of experience rather than direct teaching,\" aimed ai the \"development of people's thinking in their pew role as managers.\" Throughout, every individual's progress is a matter of constant discussion and on- the-job assessment For much of the year M & S stores are closed until 9.30 a.m. once a week. This is to allow for formal store training, em- bracing everyone, office and warehouse staff included. Pro- cedures, fashions, new mer- chandise, all are reviewed, and many timnes staff are asked, to act out a service situation. This,\" a tremendous tonic,\" solves the problem .of getting people off the job for training purposes. It may also contribute to the fact that threequarters of the M & S staff has been with the organi- sation for more than one year, and half to two-thirds have stayed for more than five years. Business End M & S also takes in a number of 18-year-olds, perhaps 50 a year, who go through a special programme leading to staff man- agement. They, too start be- hind the counter, but fearn.more intensively about the business end of, things through bead office courses. They may move into management by the time they are 20. Harrods, of course, offer such possibilities, too. In fact, this group (at the Knightsbridge store alone there are 5,000 em- ployees, some 10 per cent, of them continuously under 'train- ing) does three-tier management training, Assistant buyers leave the store for two weeks as soon as they arc appointed. and learn something about the non- selling side of the business. Three months later they have another week in the training de- partment, and after nine months they attend a 3-weeks' residen- tial course. What are the material re- wards? \" Much depends on age and area.\" is the usual some- what non-committal reply. However, a supervisor at Marks and. Spencer can earn up to Â£1,000 a year. At John Lewis Partnership a girl of- 18 may get around Â£500, and at 22 she may reach Â£700. Once on the promotional ladder, she may even earn a minimum of Â£900 a year; At Debenhams they would say no more .than \" we arc .in advance of the wages council scale.\" This may not be very imuch compared with what shorthand typists can command: but it's a good way into a steady career- if that's-what the school leavers, in particular, want.",

   "text_content" : "TEN YEARS AFTER SUEZ. By CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON, Our Foreign Editor The tenth anniversary of the Suez crisis this year has seen the expected spate of indiscreet reminiscences and magisterial post-mortems. We know now, almost minute by minute, what happened ten years ago, although there are still plenty of dark places for future historians to probe. But Britain's obsession with the most traumatic episode in her post-war history should not be allowed to distract attentior from President. Nasser's new Egypt, which has been through immense changes since--and partly as a result of-the events trg ered off by the Suez affair In ritain, there have been three changes of Prime Minister sipce :hen. But President Nasser has consolidated his position over the decade, in spite of Western predictions of impending doom, and, at 48, he may have another quarter of a century to go. Different View The Egyptians have, of course, been reflecting on Suez quite as much as any of the other partici- p-ants in the drama, but it has led them to quite different conclu- sions. It all began with the with- drawal by the U.S. of the aid offer for the Aswan High Dam as a retaliation for Egypt- decision in 1955 to sign major arms contracts with Communist countries. Ten years later, the Aswan Dam, built with Russian aid, is nearing completion, and beginning to transform both agriculture and industry with new supplies of water and power. The Americans are still trying to use their aid-which has been taking the form of $100m. a year of surplus food-to influence Egyptian policy ip such a way as to increase the prospects for stability in the Middle East The last aid agreement expired in June, and the UAR has made it clear that it is prepared to. tighten its belt to whatever extent is necessary if the conditions for the next. agreement prove un- acceptable. It is by no means certain that the Russians will come, to the rescue again this time because they are themselves so short of wheat But the Soviet Union-cer- tainly under Mr. Khrushchev has shown that, when it comes to laying down conditions for aid, it finds it just as hard to get value for money as the Americans do. There are signs, however, that Mr. Kosygin may feel that his predecessor was too soft- hearted, for example in not insisting on the release, of im- prisoned Egyptian Communists. But from President Nasser's point of view, it has been proved that it is possible to get aid from both of the two super-powers without scrificing anything essential in foreign or domestic policy. If the Russians ever thourgt that their Â£lknm. Aswan [Photo: Kwrsh of Ottawa UAR's President Naemr. loan would be enough to buy Egyptian allegiance, they must have been greatly disappointed. President Nasser has remained \"non-aligned,\" at least in the sense that, even if he sometimes depends on Russian support for his policies, he gives far less to the Russians in return. West Germany, like the U.S., has also had to learn by bitter experience that aid cannot be used to influence Egyptian policy. West German aid was suspended in February, 1965, wnen President Nasser received Prime Minister Ulbricht of East Germany on a State visit But the Egyptian attitude towards East Germany-which fell well short of full recognition-did not change, and aid from East Germany and other countries will now replace much of that from West Germany-and at lower rates of interest, as Presi- dent Nasser never tires of point, ing out In Both Senses Even more important to Eaypt was the lessoa to be learnt from the nationalisation of the Suez Canal, which was the next: stage after the withdrawal of the Aswan aid offer. Although morally obnoxious to the inter- national community, and legally questionable. Presddent Nasser's action was 6conoimically logica., as well as politically popular. Iis argument has alays been that if Egypt Cannot help from elsewhere, she must help herself--and this is what she did with the Suez Canal, in both senses of the phrase. The Aswan Dam and thC Suez Canal are the two cominanding heights of the Egyptian economy, and over the past decade they have both proved, to an extent that has surprised many foreigners, that Egyptians are capable of running their own show. The Suez Canal has been an increasingly valuable source of foreign exchange to pay for new industrial imports, brinqing in Â£450m. since nationalisation, There are now plans to widen it so as to take tankers of up to 110,000 tons, and, more ambitiously, to build a pipeline alongside it, so that tankers of any size can discharge their oil at one end, to be reloaded on to sister ships at the other. The history of the Canal has also shown that Egyptian pilots, with a diminishing contingent of foreign colleagues, and Egyptian administrators, can run a major asset as a going concern. Typical of President Nasser's favoured technocrats is Engineer Mahmoud Yunis, who was chair- man of the Suez Canal Authority from 1956-65. He was then pro. mioted to Deputy Prime Minister for Transport, and has recently been switched to Deputy Prime Minister for Electricity, Mining and Petroleum. As such, he will be in charge of oil, Which is now the UAR's biggest growth indus- try, thanks to recent discoveries in-of all places-the Gulf of Suez. (Oil is yet another com- manding height of the economy from which some foreign com- panies have been summarily evicted, although a compensa- tion agreement with Shell and BP has ftially beaen signed) In . other 'seitors of the economy, the right balance has yet to be struck, on the one hand, between foreigna and Egyptian capital, and on' the other between the UAR State and Egyptian private business ipterests. In spheres such as tourism and light industry, foreign capital has been wel- comed in partnership with State organisations, and in other cases, at the heavier end of the scale, foreign know-how has been sought without capital participa- tion, which would mean surren- deripng both profits and control over future economic planning. But the Egyptian private entre- prepeur, who controlled most sectors of the economy before the Nasserist revolution, is still surprisingly active, notably in commerce and agriculture, and even in the Arab Contractors in charge of the Aswan Dam works. Landowner Problem The survival of a capitalist element, particularly among landowners, has recently become a major political problem for the Nasser Government. The revolution has been implemented remarkably gradually, with some concern lest the economy should suffer from an over-hasty attempt to divert profits from private to State hands, which might only cause them to dry up owing to a decline in efficiency. But in the spring it was re- vealed that numerous landowners had been circumventing the land reform by illegally selling off their property, or charging rents higher than the statutory maxi- mum. A network of committees has been set up under Marshal Amer, the President's right-hand man, with the aim of rooting out \"feudalism \"-a term which may sound outdated to English ears, but is still only too applicable to many parts of the Egyptian countryside. But . President Nasser's enemies have been unmasked within his own regime-as well as among the surviving represen- tatives of the old feudalist order. In April, it was reported that a plot had been discovered among army officers dissatisfied with the continuation of tbh Yfenen war, and in July a draft penal code was published laying down the death penalty as a maximum sentence for certain \" economic crimes,\" in view of the exposure of smuggling, cdr- ruption and embezziement by government officials and army officers. Cabinet Changes Although the President's per- sonal ascendancy is more marked than ever, he has clearly been moved by these incidents to wonder whom he apn trust to carry. out his policies. He has changed his Prime Minister twice within the past year. In October, 1965, his old friend and brother-officer, Zakaria Mohied- din, took over as Prime Minister from Ali Sabri, with apparently a mandate to impose some kind of austerity on the rising trend of consumption, after President Nasser had been duly elected for another six-year term. Mohieddin also held the port- folio of the Interior, and much of his energies were taken up with bringing the authors of the Muslim Brotherhood plot to justice. Earlier this month, it seemed that Mohieddin had served his purpose. Although he retains the rank of Vice-President, he has been replaced as Prime Minister by one of Nasser's top techno- crats, Engineer Sidki Soliman, who was and is still Minister for the Aswan High Dam. Even more surprisingly, Dr. Kais- souny, who had served a long term of office as Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, has been replaced by Mr. Hassan Zaki-who is not a Deputy Prime Minister, how- ever. The new administration's main job appears to be to get the Second Plan moving. The First five-year Plan, which came to an end in June, 1965, was a brave attempt to industrialise at breakneck speed, which ended up. with rather too mixed a bag or industries, some of them Work on the Aswan High Dam. licking foreign -exchange for essettial impots,, others ham- pered by the failure of the Arab Economic Union and other such levices to provide a sufficiently big market. But the total in vestment of Â£EI,500m. was near enough to the. target of Â£E1,700m., and 6NP expanded at 6 per cent. per annum during the first four years of the plan. Egypt has thus kept her economy moving ahead faster han her population, now just over 30m. and increasing at nearly 3 per cent. per annum, despite a vigorous official birth control campaign. But the next plan will be even more difficult o implement. It will call for nearly double the investment of ts predecessor-iE2,600m. to 'E3,000m.-and the economic penalties for ill-judged projects will be correspondingly greater. It is not even certain.yet whether it will last for five or seven years. The UAR has been passing through a period of political and economic transition, so that President Nasser's role in the Arab world as a whole has been less prominent lately. But it is surely one of the lessons of Suez -for both Britain and Egypt- that President Nasser is neither as influential in other Arab countries as his friends would like to think, nor as malignant as his enemies portray him. Iraq and Syria have followed his example by nationalising foreign assets, but even they have broken away from union with the UAR. Other Arab countries, such as Kuwait and Jordan, have preferred a more gradual form of progress. There was much talk last year of closer links between the UAR and Iraq, and this year between the UAR and Syria again, after the abortive experiment of 1958-61. But President Nasser has been a sadder and a wiser man since Syria last broke away from the UAR. Arab Leadership The Arab world now looks more divided than ever. After King Faisal of Saudi Arabia had been talking for months of an Islamic summit meeting vulgarly known by diplomats a the \" Kings' Club \"--President Nasser countered in July by announcing the indefinite post. ponement of all Arab summits The rivalry between the tw- leaders, which arose out of the long struggle in Yemen between Saudi-backed Royalists and Egyptian-backed Republicans, has now broadened into a con- test for the leadership of the Arab world. It would be quite wrong foi Britain to commit herself in any way to King Faisal's side of the quarrel, whether because of a residual interest in Aden, or the aircraft sales to the Saudis, or a lingering post-Suez resentment at President Nasser's power of political survival. The best hope for Arab unity-or at least the avoidance of disunity-lies in a resolve by both President Nasser and King Faisal to give priority to edonomic development in heir own countries over political or military adventures outside their borders. Ten years after Suez, I believe that my own verdict on President Nasser lasi year will continue to hold good: \" An Egyptian first, an Arab second.\" Cainr SEGY - I",

And Hilton, not content with the Nile Hilton, is at present putting the final touches to one at Alexandria, to be followed by two more, at Luxor and Aswan, on which work has already been started.

A glance at the table shows, very. roughly, the breakdoWn of visitors to Egypt. The predoti4 nance of Jordan stenms from several roots. Although the Syrians and Iraqis have more in common politically with the Egyptians, Jordanians are geo- graphically closer, and also find it easier to take money out of the country with them than their more \" revolutionary\" neigh- bours. And this very \" revdlu, tionary\" political and social atmosphere of Cairo acts as a magnet for those who live under the opposite pole in Amman. Dinars from Kuwait, Iraq and Jordan will probably continue to flow into Egypt so long as the present Middle Eastern division into two camps lasts. Inexpensive City Although Britons form only a small number9qf the total, the Egyptians are at the moment concerned, like all other coun- tries, with the effects of the re- cent currency restrictions. In fact, Egypt is in less danger than most countries which British travellers might make for, since according to I tecenf UN survey Cairo is now-tlie least expensive of the 'world' major capital cities.

And for those who say that that is all very well but you still have to git there and Cairo is a very long way away, Whatley Whittaker, London travel agency, has produced the answer: 10 days in Cairo for 86 guineas, of which the foreign currency con tent is only Â£8.

These thre eaompanias *grud to spend among them a minimum of., S95m. on exploration operations within ten years. All the agreements are in the form of 50-50 joint ventures between the EGPC and the foreign firms concerned-often rather misleadingly referred to as the \"75-25 profit split- under which the latter are obliged to put up all the money for exploration, half of which may be reimbursed if and only if oil is found. So the big hunt was on. Results to date of exploration In the land areas have been negative. But these are early days and the heartening success in the Suez Gulf, with the promise of more strikes to come, should in any case be sufficient recompense for failure elsewhere. Survey Planned Meanwhile, the UAR Govern. ment is now preparing, with substantial aid from the Soviet Union, to embark on a two. year programme of intensive geological and geophysical survey work in uncommitted areas-particularly Sinai, the Red Sea a#4 the vicinity of the Libya boreor-to be followed by eIloration drilling. Opti. mism Is the order of the day, and Egyptian oil officials are even king in terms of a future output of m. tons a year. Emphasis has thus far been laid, perforce, on the exploration and production side of Egypt's oil industry, But It should also be noted that the UAR-despite, or perhaps because of, its hitherto meaore oil resources-is the first Arab country to have succeeded In undertaking all operations from exploration to product mqrketlne.

   "text_content" : "UNITiED AABI WRIC: By Our Cairo Correspondent One of Egypt's most pressing needs is more water to cultivate more land to feed the country's rapidly increasing population- now 30m. people, according to the census last month. At the same time, the rulers of new Egypt are well aware that agriculture cannot prosper with- out being geared to an industrial system. It is generally admitted here that one of the main reasons for the slowness of industrial development is the lack of suffi- cient power supply. The High- Dam now being built at Aswan-Lfotr miles or so south of the old Aswan Dam- seems the, perfect.answer to the country's problems. Not only will it enable Egypt to store-for the benefit of bad years-Nile water that has hitherto been lost to the seaz it will also produce a hydro-electric potential of about 10,000m. kWh a year-double the country's present power supply. Before the High Dam, out of the average annual discharge of the Nile waters, totalling, at Aswan, 93,000m. cu. metres. about 50,000m. were used for irrigation and the rest went un- tapped into the Mediterranean. The area of cultivated land in the United Arab Republic remained almost stationary from the beginning of this century until the early '50s. By the latter date it had risen from 5.047m. to 5.35m. feddans (a feddan is just over an acre), a Int increase of oily '303,000 feddans. This was. wall out of step with the rapid iacrease in population, which in the same period grew from 9.7m. to20,4mt. The High Dam will enable Egypt to. cultivate.ap.qdditional airea of 1.2n. feddans and to convert 700,000 feddans firQm basin to perennial irrigation. It will also make posible the cultivation of a1out. Im. feddans of rice each year--the signifi. cance of this being that rice is the UAR's second largest export commodity after cotton. The dependence of the country oh -otton, the value, of which is radually diminishing with the advent of synthetic fibres, will thus be reduced. Assured Supplies The new land and the exten- sion of perennial irrigation systems will increase the irri- gated area by 30 per cent., it is estimated. But the most impor- tant advantage will be that for the first time in the country's long history there will be abso- lute certainty about the water available for each and every crop in summer and winter. This knowledge will enable the Ministry of Agriculture to plan agricultural production in rela- tion to domestic needs and ex- port opportunities. Such cer- tainty has been lacking hitherto, for although the habits of the Nile are regular, the Bible story of Joseph indicates that there have always been high years and low years. The High Dam will also pro- vide complete protection against the floods that entail heavy ex- penditure on heightening and straightening the river banks. The damage to crops from flood water will be eliminated. The Nasser Lake created by the Dam Land reclamation in the New Valley. will contribute considerably to the development of fish produc- tion which, in turn, will raise the population's intake of animal protein and improve nutritional standards. The potential industrial development of the country as a result of the High Dam is too great to estimate at the moment. The yearly output of the High Dam's hydro-electric station is equal to five times the output of the old Aswan Dam. The availability of such power will. moreover, reduce the annual consumption of heavy oil by 2.5m. tons. As a result of the construction of the Dam national income is expected to increase by some Â£E234m. Works associated with the Dam are as vast as the Dam itself and are estimated to cost more than twice as much. The Dam proper will cost Â£85m. sterling and the power station Â£57.5m.; the cables to carry power as far as the Nile Delta will take another Â£50m, and the agricultural developments for use of the water-including irrigation canals, land reclama- tion, roads, housing and all the public utilities .required for the communities who will live on the new land-will cost over Â£200m. Altbgether, the Dam, the hydro-electric station and the related developments will cost about Â£415m. One Man's Drive 'Blueprints for hibis mammoth enterprise-often described as the physical startinq point of a new Ejypt-had ben lying on the shelves - of successive Egyptian Governmerits for years before the. 1952 rovolution. ' It took President Naaser's drive to get it off the ground at a time when it seemed to be beyond the capacity of his developing country and after Anglo- American offers of aid were withdrawn. With the backing of the Soviet Union work on the dam was started on January 9, 1960. So far, the Soviet Union has under- taken to contribute Â£11Om. ster- ling to. the work. The first stage was completed in May, 1964. Completion of the seqond and last stage is scheduled for 1968 although Osmah Ahmad Osman's Arab Contractors Company, which has the contract for the dam, are now speaking of completing it by next year. However, not all the major projects for Increasing the Irriga- tion area in Egypt are associated with the Nile river, Efforts are being madr for thk reclamatin# Works associated with theamaon and development of the desert regions which constitute 971 per cent. of the total area, Or a total of about 238m. feddans only some 6msti are cultivated. Projects under way aim at the reclamation of an area totalling 1457.5m. feddans, Area Reclaimed Under the first Five-year Development Plan (1960d1965) a total of 723,000 feddans-of whuseh 20,000 Ith In the Nile Valley and 203,000 in the desert arearig-have bcanals, land reclaimed The second Fiveyear Po will ln-which has now become a Seven-year has now become a Seven'yerr addition to(in in the placonversion ofextend- ing along the Mediterranean coast between Alexandria and the Libyan frontier) and the Mariut' area near Alexandria. Another major project esti- mated to cost nearly as much as the High Dam and to produce twice as much hydro-electric power concerns the Qattara oepression in the Western Desert, west of the Nile Delta and about forty miles from the Mediterranean. Artificial Sea waer. The depression s about 4ies i00 square miles In extent and falls to over 400 feet below sea level -the lowest known level In the African continent. Along the northern rim there is a ridge rising ert,50 ft above seatroun (a The plan is to bring the Mediter- ranessioan nto the depr60 miles nor thus transformt ntoad) and seahru (which won) be roughly the size of Wales); and ceaino an inflow oapable of producing extends Much ha -lectra nea wer as the Athe High Dam Thand total fall of over 1,10 foet would make It potwice ato nstall vdry powerful turbines.

The cost of the schemiles n expected to be between 4l00m. and Â£140m. sterling, sterllng. Plan to end in- 1972-envisages reclamation of 1.2m. feddans in addition to the conversion of 700,000 from basin to perennial irrigation. A number of specific projects are being simultaneously carried out by- the General Desert Development Organisation.

   "text_content" : "UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC: 4 By JOHN GARNER EDITOR, COTTON AND GENERAL ECONOMIC REVIEW It was widely supposed in Europe that' Egyptian manage iept would debase Egyptian ti lds and. in the mt . This belief ha- proved a Wisful as predictions concerning the Canal. ,he trade today Is conducted by only sia nationalised exporting comi uBaie', *peratiig under the control of the enaeral Qrgan-. ation fte Cotton.

Egypt, it should be admitted at once, sguaranteed an unlimited outlet iBs Etern Europe. Her indebte4des in that quarter, for the Aswan Damn and other aid, is such that she could surrender her entire output ahnually without balancing the account. What is remarkable, therefore, is that she avoids doing so, maintaining without apparent price differen- tiation her sales to the free currency markets. Her method of achieving this has been to initiate forward sales of each crop in the Western bloc countries, later releasing an equivalent volume by quota to the East. She has judged to a nicety the price level at which to begin selling. Once established, the level has been raised but not lowered, an operation calculated to induce early purchasing by Western spinners. Cairo has pressing need of convertible exchange, and has scant grounds for dissatisfaction with the Organisation's efforts to date. Marketing of the 1966/67 crop, which is now being picked, began in July. At no time can the problem of initial price deter- mination have been more diffi- cult. Spinners the world over evinced their customary pesd mism; ndompetition from made fibres remained stron\"Ã½- Inlia devaluation necessi a hasty reappraisal of \"sale prospects to that iniportants customer; the Sudan had failed lamentably to dispose of her crop; the only other serious rival, Peru, was increasing long. staple output, and a leafwonrm attack of unprecedented severity threatened Egypt's own crop. This last development was iniitel the rmost . alarming. Any day to announcement of price' would increase foreign apprehensdons regarding produc- tion prospects, and result per' haps in heavy buying from the Sudan. Yet a precipitate declara- tion of prices at an attractive level might lead to shortage of funds later in the event of a crop disaster. Egypt threw all her resources into saving the crop, issued confident predictions of success, and announced competi- tive initial prices. Largely re- assured, Western spinners bought moderately and awaited develop. ments. Sketchy Knowledge It is now evident that the war against leafworm has been suc- cessfully waged, Egypt's recent policy has been to withhold all official statistics until after the end of the marketing season to which they relate. Traders else- where therefore have only the most sketchy knowledge of the varietal composition of the crop and virtually no information regarding forward sales commit- ments. According to latest re- ports, the harvest will break new records for both size and quality --all else remains in doubt. To d from the peimistic ,. teor ofW -lo< i fine- yarn arket'f Europe and Japan, the sale of the long-staple crops for convertible currencies will be an uphill task this winter. Stexte tradie of Europe are Sos stringent policies, just emerg. Moreover, thel to react at 0n' 'si. in worl4 vdae a*uation in whihb gout to red c she i, inarased Perhaps the most unenviable task now confronting the Egyp- tian planner is the decision upon what style of cotton to produce in future, and la What quantity. C6ttons grown -along the Nile tend to degenerate over the years, but a comprehensive breeding and selection pro- gramme has given Cairo a wide choice of alternative new varie- ties when an established seed is found wanting. The work appeared to have lost impetus in the late '50s, but has since progressed extremely well. The new varieties are in general higher yielding, more resistant to disease, and com- mercially more desirable than their predecessors. In the longest of the three long-staple cate. gories (over 1i inches) Egypt has been much more successful than the Sudan in maintaining quality and is thus assured of virtually the whole market. In the medium and shorter groups she faces both stiffer competition from the Sudan and the steady advance of the man-made fibres.

Foreign spinners have for some years counselled Egypt to divert land to American-type cottons. Such varieties as Acala 442, the style sold so readily by California, would, it is argued command a larger market and yield more cotton for sale. Egypt has resisted such pressure, on the grounds that Acala has not been an unqualified success in the Sudan, and that applica- tion of the latest finishing tech* niques to long-staple . cotton fabrics would ensure their con* tinued demand. Retaining Control She is no doubt motivated as well by a desire to control her own destiny: as the largest pro- ducer of long staples she can hope to dictate world prices, using her superior marketing technique to maintain her pre- eminence. Entry into the wider field of American-type cotton would leave her at the mercy of the U.S., whose vast output is sold abroad at great cost to the taxpayer. Supposing that she confines her attention to long staples, is Egypt doing all she can to con- serve her markets? As regards pest control, quality improve- ment and marketing methods the answer must be yes. The restric- tions of the International Long Term Agreement for Cotton Textiles virtually rule out any t=erpo to process pore-cotton dontictlcUy,i'fr export to the W'est in the shape of yam, cloth Or made-up goods. There remains 4St, matter of promotion and reseaiirci at the 4tributive end. Egypt has lisen enthusiastic support to the new' International Institute for Cott6n, which has been created to' publicise cotton generally in \"estern Europe and. Japan. However, within the context 6f her great reliance ippn, then she has done very little to foster a preference for long-staple cot- tons among consumers. Nor has she taken a lead in research into the most effective techniques for imparting to her cottons the dripdry and permanent-press characteristics now so prized by the Western housewife. As the financial strength of the man-made fibre manufac- turers increases, so does the need for such action on the part of the cotton-producing coun tries. The question which now arises is not whether Egypt can afford to play a part, but ,whether she can afford to stand aside.",

The methods adopted by the Government, he claimed, were not merely inadequate: they were totally wrong, both in conception and. operation. It was the tak of the Liberals to draw attention to the weakness of the Government's policy and to offer a constructive alternative. Standing Ovation' With revivalist fervour *he added: \"Only a Liberal Govern- ment can resolve Britain's probleins and the policies being put forward herd can be carried out effectively only by a Liberal administration. This night of fancy earned Mr. Bessell the only standing ovation of the assembly so far# although Mr. Orimond has yet to speak.

Mr. Bessell concentrated first on the weaknesses of the Prices and Incomes-Act It would undermine the workers' need for security; it encouraged a reduction in the rate of production, and it would bring the trade 'unions under the most undesirable form of Government control. \"It is not surprising that uniqn members feel betrayed by the very party which they created and whose existence has depended for more than 75\"yeafr upon their support,\" he added. But perhpts thu ifbst dangerous aspect of the .Gd6eninents policy was the lack of knowledge of what was going to happen at the end of the sixmonthfreea. e thought the Govq~ment- Weuled to \"extW the t.e limitMa ould exerise somethin approaching per- manent control over the nions and Turnn to the more positive aspect of Liberl policies, Mr. Bessei said the party would abolish all forms of restrictive practices it would insist on properly controlled collective bar.- gaining, and It would introduce a tough and realistic an-monopolies The effect of these measures would be to bring down prices of goods Ina the hops, createwa new demand at home and abroad and increase the value of money. SMr. Bessell emphasised the impor- tance of reducing ovemnment spend- ing parularly by withdrawing forces east of Suez. If the Unite States needed British forces in the Fat east, then she must pay for them. \"We must lmae It clear to our allies that a.withdrawal.ea of Sues is imperative, and we intend to carry it out.\" This section of his speech brought a great roar of applause from the delegates. Cat Imports Plea An ameaddem calling for a reduc- tion of imports and a saving in foreign'echange by higher economic production of meat, cereals and dairy produce was moved by M. James Davldsi, MP for West Aberdeen- shire. oad accepted overwhelmingly. He irged the cstting of Britain's impMrt bIll by giving primary pro. ducers a fair retutoj and he then launched an impassoned plea to withdraw from east of Suez and pleg bes'Oriemafta*astcpipe.\" * V ri y theu flvt critcssm of the resolution came from Mr. Jullaa Port (Cambridge University). who thought Mr. Richard Walawrigt, M.P. for Cnbe Valley, who mnova the reoludon om the Efficint UKs of Mwapower. it concentrated too much on long- term policies and not enough on the short term. This argument was rejected by Mr. Hary Cowle. former director of research at Liberal heaquarters, who/ wound un for thr crxutiv. He thought the Uberal policies developed over recent years would not have led to the present economic crisis. Ending Price Rings Mr. Cowie severely criticised the Prime Minister for pursuing policies such as steel nationalisation and the introduction of the payroll tax at a time ofr economic crisis. TheGovern- ment should have instituted a major retraining programme and attacked restrictive practices on both sides of industry. \"It would only be neces- sary to put one or two businessmen in jail for the whole structure of price rigs in this country to collapse,\" he Detailed policy programmes dealing with industrial research and the employment of women were approved by the assembly.",

Although no substantial change in responsibilities took plice in their jobs on August 31, the secretaries have been upgraded. because of a change in the nature of their jobs which took p!kce about two years aio. This was due to a re-organisa. tion within the BBC, whichi put additional responsibilities on secrc- taries to the engineers in charge at BBC establishments at Aberdeen, Bangor, Edinburgh, Leeds, New- castle, Plymouth and Southamp- ton. The BBC having agreed, after protracted talks with the Association of Broadcasting Staff, to put the seven into a' higher grade, did not think it necessary to wait for the end of the incomes standstill. The BBC states it was justified because of Paragraph 18. clause 3, in the Government White Paper, which states that the incomes standstill does.,not apply 'to in-* creases in pay gepuinely resulting from promotion to work at a higher level.

The industrialists, who are all members of the .Steelworks, Plant Association; will be attecding the annual conference of the Latin American Iroh and Steel Institute in' Bogota, Columbia, from. Sep- tember 26 to 30. Speaking before its departure yesterday, Mr, W. A. Malhm, chair- Man of the association and, leader of the mission, said that the Sonth American countries planned to boost their annual steel production from 8m. Ingot tons as at present to 25m. ingt tons a year by 1975. \"To do this they.will need to buy a great deal of now plant- and this is where we hope to do quite a bit of. business,\" Mr. Mather said. As an additional 1m. tons in steel production requires an in- vestment of about Â£20m.. this rise in production is estimated to cot South America in the region of Â£340m. Mr. Mather said that since the war the British steel plant manu- facturer had been overshadowed by the Americans because of their ability toagrant credit over a long period of tine and at a very low interest rate. However he said there was evi- dence of greater flexibility by the Export Credits Guarantee Depart- ment iq relation to South American guarantees andl this, coupled with the .continent's development plans, had been a factor in the mounting of the present mission.

Mr. JohnCi Guy, BEA's sale manager (cargo), told a Press con- erence in London yesterday that EsA is pushing forward with plans for the establishment of air reight service networks from key provincial airports, with Man- hester and Birmingham and then Glasgow at the. top of the list. Next. week a decision is to be aken on the question of starting a air-freight service from Man- heiter to Germany. If the necessary arrangements can be made, this would be brought into operation in November. \"In the longer term there are likely to be about five or six air- 0rts in the U.K. from which BEA will operate direct freight rvices to the Continent,\" said Mr. Guy. Situated in the manufacturing areas, these airports would be able o provide a \"through service\" rom the factory by truck straight on to the aircraft. In the light of these prospects, BEA was proceeding with the planned expansion of its cargo- ying fleet. In addition to the five Argosy aircraft at present in noeration, the airline proposed to phase into service the Vanguards as these were converted into freighters. Tenders for the conver- sions were now being invited.

The D iBoad of Trade. Itself can do a lot of the initial donkey-work, like putting the would-be exporter in. touch with otsible agents. Even so, a good teal of the information which a company would take for granted when selling in the home market can only be won by hard experi- ence. One suggestio has been to set up more Export Trainin Centres, with short courses for tudying salesmanship and market- ing abroad. These would involve practising on the spot so that small firnns could finance an executive taking the course by the orders he won. Foreign contacts In the meantime there is clearly a market for the export consultant the man to whom a firm can say, we want to sell potato peelers in ;candinavia. Can you get us there? \" For the big companies- - merchant bank, for example, with- its close contacts in foreign coun- tries, is willing to act in this capacity anyway. Where can the smaller company obtain similar expertise? This, at any rate, was the line of thought which led one- ex-merchant bank man to set up a consultancy in Notting Hill. \"Let us unravel your European problem\" is the slogan adopted by this new sort of animal. Rudi Mr. R. WedswelIer Welisweiller found that while he was head foreign exchange dealer at Schroders and later foreign manager for Philip Hill, he was giving the sort of advice on Europe o his larger clients that would be extremely useful to a much wider ange of companies. The result was a company called Neisweiller Adfos that benefits rom a European network of dis- icretly well - informed contacts (acquired from Rudi Weisweiller's merchant banking experience and European ' family connections). Sidea is to give companies in e-rated in going into Europe a sevice which will shrtcut many of their problems. On the simplest level this vmeans finding capable agents, something which companies could, with Board. of Trade help. do for theiselves, at the risk of spending a good deal of executive time. For instance a company selling a new type of photo album Wanted to expbrt It to ive countries in E urope. Weisweiller Adfos' continental associates did the leg w*rk and came up with the required wholesalers. Personal link On a rather more complex level a leading British company of building contractors wanted to acquire some more continental clients. Weisweiller Adfos did a survev to find out who were plan- ning large building projects and introduced the British firm to the most promising clients. But perhaps the most Interesting service that this kind of consultant can offer Is on a much more per- onal level. For lnstance, one British company was planning a oint venture with a catering arm a Holland. But it only had super, fical information on either the business or its owners. \" We made ocal enquiries, the sort of thing which would be tricky for a British company to do by itself, and within a week were able to build up a detailed 'inside' report.\" Licen sing arrangements are another good example of a situation where a tird party can smooth the way for companies not used to working nternationally. Small companies are not the only ones which need advice and help abroad. Sometimes a company wants to establish itself in another country without immediately reveal- ing its identity. A big hotel group, for instance, wanted to set up a chain of hotels in Germany. But it did not want to disturb local property values by looking for sites itself. So it hired Weisweiler Adfos to make the initial enquiries. But very often what companies want is straight advice, and the Weisweiller Adfos experience sug- gests that despite the impressive amount of Government hel avail-* able, what is badly needed (apart from more specialist consultants) is more export training facilities. At present the two major training centres in Britain are Thurrock Technical College and High Wycombe Technical College (where the first export course was started). Chile Ashmore, Benson, Pease and Company, a member of the Davyy Ashmore group, has obtained an order from Empresa Nacional de Miineria of Chile, for a 5 feet diameter Aerofall mill test plant complete with air classification sys- tem motors and exhaust bag filter. Wrapping Since April this year Auto Wrappers (Norwich), of the Tobenoil group of companies, has secured export orders for wrapping machinery worth more than Â£140,000. An additional contract for a further Â£20,000 is expected shortly."

Struock and Co., of Koln- Ehrenfeld, Germany. Either hot or-cold glue can be used, depending on the materia' of the label and the container. Two independent glue applicators allow hot glue, cold glue or hot and cold glue to be used. When hot glue is employed the tempera ture of the applicators and the rollers is thermostatically con- trolled. The machine can only be started when the correct, preselected glue temperature is reached. If the temperature falls below the pre- selected figure the machine auto- matically switches off. The machine has few moving parts, works on a rotation principle and functions continuously without stroke movement or interruption for starting a new cycle. Carriers for the Panama Canal NIPPON KOKAN of Japan reports a new class of 65,000 tons deadweight bulk carrier as an addi- tion to its series of \"standard ee class ill be called Panama: to indicate that it will be the largest type of vessel allowed through the Panama Canal. The design has been evolved to take advantage of the change in regulations which increased the maximum width of ships permitted through the canal to 106 feet. The ships will be 767 feet in length, 106 feet in breadth and have a speed of 16 knots. Their dead- weight tonnage will vary from 65,000 to 69,000. U.K. address of the company is 3rd Floor, Marlow House, Lloyd's Avenue, London, B.C.3. Epoxy insulators for high voltage HIGH-VOLTAGE insulators of cast epoxy resin are lighter and stronger than porcelain ones, claims the Insulator Division, General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York. In addition, according to OG, porcelain is in short supply and is weak in tension, while there is plenty of epoxy with tensile strength of 12,000 lbs per square inch. Several manufacturers are mak ing the epoxy insulators in lengths up to 20 feet. They use a cycle aliphatic epoxy which has better resistance to weathering and elec- trical breakdown than opichlorhy drin plastics.

It is the largest ever made at the Tube Turns DIvision of the Chemetron ,Corporatin at Loausville, Kentucky. Versatile material for designers ANOTHER material has been added to the sculptor's traditional media of clay, retal. wood and stone. It is rigid urethane foam made with Du Pont \"Hylene organic isocyanates and 'Freon\" blowing agents. The foam is supplied in two den.

It is easy to carve and smooth- finish, while mistakes are easily corrected by the glucing-on of a new piece of foam for recarving. The material takes lacquers, paints and resins, will not splinter, rot. chip or crack and is without grain, voids or soft spots. The heavier type has five times the compressive strength of more familiar plastics foams and shows remarkable re- sistance to damage or denting. The many advantages of the new foam material should also prove useful to industrial designers, since very many new appliances are pre- ceded by models in wood, clay or plastics. Called Artcel. the material is manufactured and marketed in the U.K. by The Baxenden Chemi- cal Company, Clifton House, 83- 117, Euston Road, London N.W.I. Du Pont does not manufacture ur- thane foams but produces organic isocyanates and the blowing agents used in its manufacture.

For he thew South African procedurp ecame fashionable,, the damage filcted on Britain's International isuranci business could be of a ery worrying order. Danger AvertedW it would seem that by energetic lv mobilising all the unas ithin theirt reach in Rhodesia., lovd's underwriters have been ble to avert the danger of being riven to wholesale default on eir obligations to Rhodesian cus- omers. But this has naturally not revented the affair leaving the pod name of British insurance ooking a little tarnished-in thte lense that is, that it has shown ow its preservation can be re- arded in British official circleq as r less consequence than politidc onsiderations. Thus, in spite of the Chancellor i the Exchequer's inrm assurance hat circumstances could never rise wherein South African cus omers of the British insurance idustry would be left in the. vul Nerable position that Rhodesian a6es were by the sanctions ro- ramme. the South African Gover. nent has gone ahead with its plan to introduce new safeguards against such a contingency, The broad result then is thai British and other foreign-based eompatmes will be forced to keep a substantial part of their premium, iacome within the country drigs the next year or so-tis with the bject of creating a local fund from w*nich Insurers' daims can be settled in the event of the country being involved in a ' 13 ode te theensuing interferencewith norma financial traffic. Obviously, the resltiag eelt for the companies c.meb d modify their procedurelIn ader to cope with this requirement is going to make life more complicated for them. But, as it assets in most cases a relatively small part of their total overseas bsiness, the disloca- tionwill not usually be of a really serious ordeM he saggestion t(h U.K. concerns may decide to with draw from tbe South African market altogether n account of it is denied in London. Moreover, the introduction of the scheme may have the advantage of reducing the v*ulnerability of British lnsumer operating in the South Afridar market to competition fromw the locally based industry based on the spread of the idea that it is no longer safe to use the oCrvices of 'forigo itbsurers. Finger of Suspicion Of course, had it not been for the British Ooyrement's behaviour ovc Rhodqslan claims, the finger of suspicion might never have been pointed at British insurers in South As ica in this way. But there is, unaftely, no turning back the cl!ek on this one. And accord' iiigly: if the South African Govern. ment s new measure helps to con- iain the damage the British in- surance industry's standing 'ha suffered in South Africa, It will obviously have its brighter side. However, it cannot be. taken for granted at this stage that Britain's International insurance business will eseape as lightly as this from the consequences of the blunder the Government perpetrated by bringit# the industr activities within the scope of t:sae ctions proramme when ther was no teal oeed to ndo 0* Am, South Arica had, of ootirse, a special reason for reacting sharply to this development, since she und andably ees t hens as inS n grtn dnger o_ beina thefuture target.of an international sanctions programme than- the -nilu run of countries. iBut it is ry no means certalik that the Inevitable tendency the lntroduc- tion of safeguards will have to spotlight her fears won't draw the attention of other largeescale users of British insurance facilities abroad to the matter. A Big Worry There is the further point that the South African precedent may encourage countries that are not at all worried about sanctions threats to interfere with the flow Of insurance traffic for entirely different reasons-for example to strengthen the flow of funds Into the financing of domestic expendi. There Is, In short, a real possi- bility that the South African move will set a fashion. And, if it were to do this, the consequences for British insurance would be very much more worrying. For one thing, the strength of the insurance industry depends to a significant extent on its ability to keep a cen- tral pool of liquid assets from which funds can he shifted to any corner of the world where they happen to be needed-and, Insurance being insuranc. there con be big variations from month to month in the requirements of the varipussectors. For another, the necessity to keep fuqds- in local employment rather than where they can earn the best return will often tend to mean a serious loss of earning power- which, in turn, will make it more difficult for the industry to see that it is not priced out of world mar kets. The sanctioas blunder created a big worry for the British insurance nladustry. It looks as though it will be some considerable time before it will be able to forget about it.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Just Unemployment, or Redeployment?",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "THE LATEST unemployment figures show that the rise which began last spring is now accele- rating.. The number of. people wholly unemployed usually rise between June and September by about 2,000: this year it rose by more than 55,000, with nearly half the increase concentrated in the last month of the quarter. At the same time, the number of egistered but unfilled vacancies has been dropping much more sharply than is usual at this time of year. These figures were collected on September 12, before the various redundancies -announced recently had come into effect. It looks very much a- if unemployment is going to rise not only further but faster than the Government has beer suggesting. Union anxiety It is understandable, in these circumstances, that trade union leaders should be anxious about the effect on their members and that there should have been a ge-neral demand to soften the imi pact of- the Government's de nationary policies by sharing out the available work until condi tions improve. But -this would only frustrate the object of what has been done. The Govern ment claims that its intention is not to create unemployment for its own sake but to encourage the redeployment of labour from one industry to another. The rise in unemployment is to be a rise in the number of. men on the move between jobs, and work-sharing can only impede this process. Short-time work ing is all right for a brief transi tional period, particularly in cases where no warning has been given about the seriousness of the situation at a particular works; but protracted short-time working as an alternative to re dundancy makes no economic sense at all. The Transport and General Workers' Union is now half willing to admit this, It is opposed to arbitrary sackings but believes in orderly redeploy- ment. It wants workers on short- time whose skills are needecf4l1* bhere to be encouraged to trans for. It suggests that th Ministry of Labour should help workers -as, indeed, it is already doing to find new jobs before they lose their old so that they can move without interruption or hardship from one to another. This is an attitude with which it is impossible not to sympathise. The more firms get into the habit of warning the Ministry in advance that redundancies may be on the way, and the more the Ministry can do to find alterna- tive jobs in advance and smooth the transition, the better for everyone concerned-and for the Government's economic policy. Steps of this sort would supple- ment what has already been done through retraining schemes, removal assistance, and, wage- related unemployment benefits to encourage mobility. Disincentive . Yet most people dislike change enough to resist it quite strongly. The Ministry of Labour may come up with the offer of an alternative job, but it will pro- bably be a different sort of work in different conditions; it may call for training, it may mean moving to a different part of the country, it may mean accepting a cut in pay. Many people, given the choice of keeping their old job part-time .until conditions improve, would take it. It is arguable, in fact, that our present arrangements-SET apait.-do too. much to make short-time working an attractive substitute for job-changing. The average car worker, for example, gets Â£24 a week. for working full-time. If be moves to a three. day week, his pay drops to Â£14 10s, but (married with one child) he can claim Â£2 10s unem- ployment benefit; at the same time, apart from repayment of past tax, be saves about Â£2 a week in tax. All in all, he may be only a few pounds a week ,worse off, and with two spare \"ays in which to pick up un official odd-job money. By cushioning him against chanpe, the Jsystem makes. the incentive to move voluntarily to another job rather small. There is some- thing to be said for limiting to a few weeks the period a\"l which- men on sbort-tlum il receivub d inployment benefit.",

   "text_content" : "FROM J b. F. JON4 ,AIC O NOW IN SALISBURY E VERYONE in Rhodesia, except perhape for Africans deep in the tribal reservesm has been affected in some way by sactions. But very few people have, as yet, come under the sort of pressure which might inspire political reaction out of economic distress. There have already bee victims of course: the clerks and tsei-skilled Europeans out of work, the African leaders restricted, the journalists d- ported, the white politicians passed by, even the Governor and thb men who have stood by him. But for most white Rhodesians, sanctions are at best a joke, at worst a nuisance. This article is about five more or less typical Rhodesians. They are all Europeans because it is against them that sanctions have been directed. Mrs. Robinson is a moderately well-off housewife who refuses to take an interest in politics. Sanctions have affected her in only three ways-her house- keeping bills have gone up sharply (perhapp as much as 15 per cent.), she is unable to find certain items in the shops, and she is forced to use a number of Rhodesian-produced food products rather than the inter- national brand names she is accustomed to. Her protests are shrill but hardly serious. Her actual list of shortages is a brief one. She cannot buy imported chocolate, and the new Rhode- Duty look for an oportid product. ian vatiety is not very good and i not easy to find. This week er grocer was rationing tinned EMit in an easy-going way. The hortage of cornflakes that was amous a couple of months ago as been ended, but Mrs. Robin on does not like the locally pro ueed substitute. She cannot get Lea and Perrins sauce and does not like the local tomato etchup. Cosmetics are a wide. spread grumble among her friends-some of the expensive international brands cannot be bought for love or money. Locally-produced clothes have taked over the market but can- not compete in quality; Mrs. Robinson complains that she is driven to buy two local dresses at Â£5 each where she would normally have bought one im- ported garment for Â£12. Her main complaint is that the choice of so many goods has been cut back. A lot of * non-essential housing utensils are either hard to find or shoddy and at inflated prices. But Mrs. Robinson is certainly not going without anything she needs to keep her home at its normal prosperous and con- tented level. What she shares with her friends is a self. mocking irritation with the a quality of the local substitute I products. A scurrilous (and illegal) university broadsheet i caught the mood well the other i day. It reported the conversa. i tion at breakfast in the Ian 4 Smith household: \" Have some I marmalade, dear,\" says Mrs. I Smith. \"This jar is pouring nicely.\" I Tobacco Troubles Mr. Jameson is a tobacco farmer, efficient, prosperous, and popular. He has bad his I present farm, about one hun- dred miles from Salisbury, for seventeen years. He is a staunch i supporter of UDI and of Mr. Smith. Last year he had 150 acres under tobacco and like all farmers, he had an anxious 1 time waiting to know what price I his crop would fetch from the Tobacco Corporation (the Cor- poratio bought the leaf at a reserve price depending on the officially asesied grade, and is responi~ble for reselling it to any buyer who dares to brave the international embargo). Like many tobacco farmers Jameson felt tbat his leaf was badly down-graded . and he found he was paid an average of 24d per pound where he had expected at least 28d. He reckons this crop cost him 30d per pound to produce-which is well above the national average. The recent 5 per cent. bonus was welcome and he is expect- ing the Government to make ____ nocking irritation with te a another 5 per cent. payment on top of this. He needs this to He has decided to stick to tobacco this coming year but the quota he expects to te given by the Government bis not big enough for the 90 acres he plans to plant, so he is trying to buy quotas allocated to other farmers who have since decided to switch to cattle or maize. Last year he employed 120 Africans and this year with 90 acres he will only need 70, but he hopes he can afford not to lay off too many of the African families who have been working for him for years. Jameson warns his family that they may have to leave the farm, but they do not take him too seriously nor would he want 'Waone W think he were in hopvenn starits. He reckons he willpposurvive provided the crisis does not last for long. But he has decided that he must sell his great love-his private air- craft. Depressing Quotas MrTobacco Arnold runs at store inCor the middle of Salisbury. When sanctions were imposed he feared a rapid rundown of economic activity, and knew he was . especially vulnerable because a large proportion of his business was based on goods from overseas. His first import quotas were depressing because the addition to a general mport out they slashed back the range of his goods and almost elimin- of bis goods and almost ellmih' ted the luxury trade which had men doing so well. To-day Mr. Arnold says he is nanaging far better than he vould ever have thought pos- iible. In the past eight days, he laims, his returns are better han the same period last year. lis stocks, which had been at heir bighest-ever level at UDI, ,olstered him till February or tarch. He has cut overheads- vhere possible but a store can lo less in this respect than a 'actory and on the staffing. side ic contented himself with not replacing the natural resigna- tions. The secret of Mr. mrnold's survival seems to be a forced switch to local products which has been so complete that his regular customers will tell you the character of the stor6 bas utterly changed. This hasf neant a near abandonment of the luxury trade (either the goods are not available, or no one is buying them, or the new Rhodesian factories cannot pro- duce high quality goods). This in turn has brought a noticeable cut back in Mr. Arnold's price level, which has been partly counterbalanced by an increase in the volume of trade. British goods are still available through mysterious channels though the anti-British feeling here-is so strong that Mr. Arnold is careful not to draw too much attention to them. Old Complaint He cannot honestly say he is optimistic about the future and he knows that life would be better for him if there had been no UDI (he is not a Smith sup- porter). But he is not especially worried by any threat of. man- datory sanctions. His wife tells him food is more expensive but he is well off and this does not worry him. More important, an old complaint that golf balls were unobtainable has now been solved-visitors and overseas friends have rallied round to such effect that he has seven dozen new balls in his locker. Mr. Edwards sells machinery. His first problem was to got his imports through the embargoes and into the country. To-day, with his new lines of supply functioning effciently, he is mord cdnc6d &bout the high level of overdiue farmers' credit. He believes that the British sanctions programme is being inefficiently handled. Most of the items he wants that used to come from Britain he now receives either from sister companies on the continent which can supply the identical product or, if this fails, through despatch direct from Britain with the destination altered at sea. In contrast the U.S. embargo is highly efficient; at least one important U.S. com- pany has warned its agents throughout the world against passing on any of Its products to Rhodesia.

   "text_content" : ";By Our LabotL Reporter While more than Ira. bildlag workers yesterday acmepted te wags freeze, protests from mularied groois cnt1aeB d The National Union of Bank Employees announced plans for a fresh approach to Mr. Ray Gunter, Minister of Labour, in view of the Government's decision to allow the Clydeside shipbuilding pact, and the doA ors are preparing a rnew bid to ease the effect of the squeeze on their members. The railway unions saw the Prime Minister yesterday and got the pledge they wanted. Mr. Wilson gave them a firm promise that the 3% per cent. increase ostponed on September 5 would 'definitely be honoured on March 5 next year. Union leaders representing well over Im. building workers reluc- tantly accepted the freeze in London yesterday when they were told by Mr. Harry Weaver, general secretary of the National Federa- tion of Building Operatives, that the alternative was taking on the Government The only major union to oppose Mr. Weaver's argument was the Transport and General Workers'. The leaders of the building unions were informed that in prac. tical terms the freeze viould mean that an increase agreed for November before the freeze would not take place until May. A cost* of-living rise, said Mr. Weaver, if it was justified by next March, according to the terms of the current agreement, would not now be paid until September, 1967. The bank employees think their arguments have been strengthened by the Government's decision to allow the Clydeside shipboilding agreement through, on the ground that some of the Clyde workers had already been paid their increase before July 20. NUBE pointed out yesterday that senior bank officials at the National Pro- vincial had been conceded a rise of 3 to 3% per cent. on July 1, while the other banks had not been able to pay a similar increase because their proposed rise had not been paid by July 20, when the incomes standstill came into efect Heanor defiant Meanwhile, 90 employees of Heanor (Derbyshire) Urban Counm cil will to-day receive an IUs in- crease in pay despite Government intervention to enforce the freeze. Both the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government have urged the coun- cil not to pay the 3%d an hour rise, but the Labour-controlled group decided by 10 votes to 6 to pay their manual workers the exua 11s a week, backdated to September 5. The council is however to observe the freeze as far as white collar staff are concerned.",

The appeal to the Government came after execu- tive members .had seen thi latest Ministry, of Labour unemployment figures, which showed a nse of 27,936 in jobless during the last month.

A W*rnifig The union's executive committee yesterday expressed firm opposition to large-scale redundancies, and warned that industrial disputes can be avoided only if there is \"full and adequate consultation and negotiation on a factory-by-factory basis\" about the rsasons for cuts in production. The delenation will press the Miniltry to Improve its job-finding services, so that men can be traps- ferred to new work without a period of unemployment In any case, Mr. Cousins was not satisfied that jobs were as easily available as Mr. Gunter had sug. gested. The British Motor Corporation's factory level consultation about cutbacks had been quite inade- quate, Mr. Cousins claimed. \"We are back where we were ten years ago.\" There was growing fear among his members that British motor companies did not have the capital to cushion them during periods of recession. As a result, the long-term future of British concerns was being jeopardised while American financed motor companies were able to weather the storm.

It is clear that the TOWU believes it has evidence of situations similar to that on the Clyde, where some workers were being paid when the freeze came into effect and others were not.

The Con- truction and Use regulations ave not yet been brought to te oint were truck which is right for ie British market is right for every country in t ihe world, but the gap is much less that iIt *as. And the Labour Goverament's drive for tighter inspe tion standards, with, rigd rules against over- loading to come later, offers a splendid insttrahce. against any aggaing in de.nid. Production Problem For some time, ipdeed, pro- duction 'has. beet -th problem. Dceliveris of compoients, from complete engines down to indi- vidual parts and cAtings, have beein desperately hard to get: new machine tools have been months late, and even had they arrived many firms could not find the labour to work them. Now these various jams are clearinig. Ford has led the way: *production was in chaos last year while its new models were incubated, but this year the corn pany has set a new production record every month, and in August actually nosed ahead of Bedford as the biggest truck producer in the country. Bed ford, of course, was hatching its own new arrival, the very significant 164tonner, and should oon make up the lost ground now. Meanwhile Leyland and the smaller specialist assemblers are looking forward to reaching their own long-unattainable targets.' In exports, too, the industry can be satisfied, though not complacent. The totals have looked rather static for the last two or three years; but this has been achieved in spite of a drop in woild-wide trade. The more advanced importing countries, especially South' Africa and Australia have. been growing more se:f-sufficient. while the developing countries 'bave been sending off imports while they built up their currency reserves. The point, as any manufacturer will tell you, is that the British industry has increased its share of the available trade in every important region of the world outside the-Common Market. The Common Market itself may have to wait for our entry, cr t any rate for the Kepedy On the surface, then. It is a picture as bright as the ex- hibits: yet conversation need not scratch very deep before a certain uneasiness begins to show. The outer layer, as it were, Is the short-term worry: can it last ? The industry usually expects a setback about nine months after the car manufacturers first feel the pinch. Waiting lists are notoriously volatile, and some of the biggest and normally most optimistic firms expect to HOME MARKET Iso 50 0 '1980 6! 62 65Â· 6* 66 EXPORTS be working hard for their sales before next summer. As even their rivals will concede, BMC trucks may have had their troubles, but they have their merits too: merits enough, cer tainly, to keep Bathgate work- ing more than three days a week if demand were as in sistent as jt- looks to rival salesmen. About the long-term outlook Some of the doubts are rather miore profound. In the home market, progress in design and -Crrying capacity, the demand for more power and more com- sortable cabs (it is dot easy to hold a good driver), and above all, the steady piling-up of new regulations, have been main- taining good sales. But these are largely replacement 'ales (as can be seen from the diagram). The transport in- dustry .is buying bigger trucks but it is not using many more of them. And when the in- dustry has its new trucks, with adequately big engines, and is not allowed to overload them. will this rate of replacement hold Up ? A smaller portent at the moment is the great initial suc- cess of British Rail's Freight- liner scheme. It wil .be some years before this iakes a size- able dent in the - transourt market as a whole, but it will not be long before it has a noticeable impact on .the specialised field of lone-haul trunk road transport. This is l r of the spaHtj;6 &t buildert bifc high- H\"uali!t k tr c apable of 50an 250,090 mile wIE ouinum loas before overhtil. But its the railways ar- to become the economical medium for stages over 100 miles (and here the Govern- menofts known prejudices are not at all hipu) ta transport industry will not need such high mileages, even if it still needs big trucks. This woul- be the real opportunity for Uth volume pro ducer to make their challenge . to the specialists. Furthet down the, weight rang the competition has already arrived-tils is the real meaning of B.M.C.'s short time, for BMC concentrate- mainly on the smaller trucks and light vans. Production of medium trucks has stuck this year at about the high 196: level; van production has been failing, and is running some \"I% per cent. below the level last year. Ford compeittion has hurt virtually everyone else. Superficial This gloomy sketch of the longer-term outlook is in its way as superficial as the im- mediate picture of a boom. The present high level of replacement demand looks safe for some time yet-and may *ell carry the industry througo to the next economic upturn with much less of a setback than was suffered in 1962-63 when production dropped by 2I% per cent. (recovery, like slump, is usually delayed in this industry). Above all, it leaves out exports. The National Plan laid down a rise in com mecial vehicle -roduction of 83,000 annually bv 1970, with exports of 230,000. This would imply a rise in the British share of the *Vd truck trade fom the 30 per Los I1bWe at least 33 per t iceably higher than the inuIt's best-ever penetration in 117 Can this b done?

Earl's Court does not *94 provide evidence of the ,ful measure of this potential. Present models are still behind some American and iideed European standards in size power, and, in the biggest trucks, in cab comfort . But in value-for-money they cannot be bettered, as witness the present share of the world trade. And as trucks become increasingly specialised (both Ford and Dodge outside the real specialist field, offer some 500 catalogue variants), the growth of the con- tending companies is providing a market for a really large-scale components. industry - the engines, axles, gearboxes and braking systems so prominently displayed.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY, STApF At the half-year WP shows higher profits; but Shel is re- ducing the interim payment. Vlckers holds the interim but warns that the final may not be covered fully by profits. Dualop. has earned more pre-tax and EMI has come up with the ex- pcted higher profits (all are discussed by Lex on .Page 1). But Frederick Hotel has to re- duce the dividend and TWW is cutting the interim payment. Henry Wigfall in most cases the price paid by rental companies for bigger busi- ness is a sharp rise in deprecation and a consequent fall in profit.. When turnover falls the reverse is true. And Henry Wlgfall writing off two-thirds of its sets in the first. two years of their life reflects the mechanics of this situation better than most. Thus, with write-offs on rental down' from Â£2.67m. to. 2.49m. and transfer to H.P. re- serves Â£1.80m. against Â£1.84m., the point is that the group has (predict- ably) had a less busy year on its TV side-and pre-tax profits are Â£602,000 against Â£490,000. Tax ;akes only 30 per cent, of the gross again and with earnings of 31 per cent. the dividend is maintained at 25 per cent. This leaves Wigfall yielding nearly 7.8 per cent, at 16s 9d and with its conservative depreciation policy looks reason- ably placed in current conditions. At least a lower growth rate; although not really desirable should keep the dividend safe. Dalgety Compared with the half-year position when pre-tax profits were 23.7 per cent. down, the results of Dalgety and New Zealand Lea look positively encouraging with a modest pre-tax fall of 3Y per cent. to Â£3.78m. But in fact this figure is n*ot really as good as it looks, in- cluding as it does about Â£255,000 benefit from a change in the basi.. of livestock revaluation. The gap between 1965's total therefore widens to a tenth, which is reason- able in view of the Australian drought. Fortunately, the effect of his was somewhat overestimated and the situation did improve in the .econd half. But it will take - -ouple of years to get back to normal. Meanwhile it is up to the U.K. and New Zealand to make the running-which was the case last year. With the group's mainly agri-' cultural operations it is diffitult to nake any predictions, apart from saying that'the dividend looks in to immediate danger. As forecast. he total is 12 per cent.-covered abouot6.t imes with overspill and he stock reviltation, Ex-overspill, the shares seem to be on -a P/E ratio of 10.5:1 at 35s 3d and yield an adequate 7 per cent, Bell's Asbestos \"'hile overseas earnings are us- ul, they cannot always be relied on to remedy. a diflcult U.K. situation. The interim statement of Bell's Asbetos and Engineering s a good illutration, for although profit.ar up'in th fit hisl du o oversas effiots, the rest of the wear will wipe out the benefit, The point, is tht the 2% per cent rise in first-half profits of Â£800,000 pre-tax. conceals a drop in the U.K contribution front 62 to 53 per cent. . B4 whereas overseas coni- ranies raied their proportion troml 38 to 47' P cent.. ovell rasults will only show a, modest iiProve hnent. i i mahnly et = 9. \"O rupee devaluation, but also a enseral slackening abroad. Althouh ad uncbasd 25 per t i forecast, prots are not expected to be high\" as in 1965. This suggests that there ought not to be a serious fall and the dividend was safely covcre 1.7 times on, last year resnults But the 5.1 per cent yield a- 24* 7%d already takes a generous view of prospects. TWW' In line with last May's warning that the 107% per cent. total pay- ment may not be maintained. TWWs first Interim dividend has been cut by 15 points to 25 per cent. But the half-year figures pose more questions than they answer. Profits before tax and the adver- tising levy are 11 per cent off at Â£1.35m. and emerge 17% per cent down to 820.000, pre-tax. The slight increkse in the levy ndicate that advertising revenue is being maintained-despite the cessation of cigarette advertising and the ' squeeze.\" On the other hand the group is now producing more pro- grammes under its new licence, which has probably added jto costs. Diversified activities helped to a very great extent \" to offset the 14,' per cent. drop in 1965 tele- vision profts. The latest statement gives no indication of how these in- terests are currently performing. but the TV side looks reasonably encouraging. Only four months ago local advertising was showing a fairly substantial increase and the opening of the Severn Bridge could add further impetus. The shares closed 10%d lower at 21s 4Xd. W. H. Paul The 1965-66 dividend of W. H- Paul is 15 per cent. against 22% per cent., and profits are down from Â£140,000 to Â£91,000 before tax with earnings providing cover of 2.3 times for the lower rate. Not surprisingly, the shares lost Is 3d to I Is on the news. However, the group is not so badly placed' as these figures might suggest. Last year was difficult, particularly on the important kitchen equipment side. But a new line is now meet- ing with success and the group is far from depressed about the cur- rent year. A new addition to the- range of central heating radiators is also thought to have plenty to offer. Costs should also get some relief fromin the new factory, now in ful production. All thit would sit oddly with the reduced dividend, but for two points. In the first place, the new factory and other spending has probably left, fihances short at a time when (ex investment allow- ances and taking into account that the dividend cost will double next ecar when the \"A\" shares rank ror sbrvicing) retentions could dis- appear. In fackopn current profits the lower rate would be short- earned . by roughly 2 points.

   "text_content" : "The directors of Del's Asbestos and Engilaering (Holdings) anticipate that group profit for 1966 will not be as high as for 1965, but the dividend is expected to remain unchanged at 25 per cent. A maintained interim of 10 per cent. is declared. Group sales increased to Â£8.6m. for the half-year to June 30, 1966, compared with Â£7.9m. for the corresponding period of 1965, and profit, before tax, advanced from Â£780,000 to Â£800,000. Sales for the full year 1965 amounted to' 16.nm. and profits Were Â£1,701,000. The increase in profit is attributable solely to the overseas companies which have maintained their \"en- couraging progress\" during the first six months. Mainly on account of the devaluation of the Indian Rupee, overseas results for the full year, how. ever, will show only a modest im- provement, the directors state. At home, sales have increased but adverse trading conditions resulted in reduced profits from the U.K. com- panies and conditIons are licey to become progressively more diicult during the' coming months,.

'The iterim paid Jo November 19653 as a distribution, under tb4 old t4 system, of 7d free of tax-e4qual to 11.9d it grossed up by the standard rate of Income-tax.

The tOtl dividend for 1965 was 1 dper shae, of which Is 4)(d was paid free of tax. Last May, charman Mr. F. J. Stephens pointed out that 1966 dividends would fed the tidl Im. pact of the new tax basi. With a 40 per cent. corporation tax rate, relief would cover only about two. fifths of the income-tax deduction from a dividend of is 6d per share which meant holders would suffer to the extent of about 5s in the Â£, he said.

   "text_content" : "Group profit of Staplegren Insurance Holding amounted to Â£1,426,604 for the year to March 31, 1966, and the net figure was Â£606.467. . The figures incorporate Gardner Mountain d'Ambrumenil and Fennie which became a subsidiary in May, 1965, The figures for the previous 15-month period are not comparable as they included profits of the holding company and certain subsidiaries for more than 12 months and excluded Gardner Mountain. A final dividend of 11 per cent. makes a total of 36 per cent., as forecast. This maintains, on capital enlarged by the' acquisition of Gard- ner Mountain, the same annual rate as for the previous 15 m1nths.

Underwriting Setback The enlarged group more than maintained aggregate profits despite a decrease of Â£135,000 in profits from underwriting agency commis. sions. This was achieved largely as the result of a 25 per cent. increase in profits from insurance brokerage and a 12 peidtront. incftasein niuvestf ment income. 'Changes in the source of profits resulting both from the acquisition and from group trading during 1965. 1966 are shown below. 196546 1964-65 IauiWne. brokera&e. 53.6 43.3 48.3 Lloyd's underwrlrng: Agency fees .... 8.4 9.3 4.6 Commulo ln .... 13.9 23,7 26.0 Shipping and travel 3.0 4.6 6.8 Invqtient Income.. 20.9 18.9 14.3 Althoufh too early to forecast results oftbe current year, It is appar. ent there will be a further reduction in underwriting agency commissions, as the results of the 1964 account will be worse than those for 1963. The 1965 account which carries the major portion of the \"Betsy\" hurri. cane loss and which will be reflected in the 1967.68 accounts is likely to show a further deterioration. It is emphasised that underwriting activi. ties cannot involve the group in underwriting losses. but at the worst could eliminate income from under- writing commissions. says the chair- man, Mr. E. S. Hogg. Brokerage Fillip For the next two years at least the group faces the challenge of attempt- ing to meet reducinp profits from underwriting commissions by further increases in profits from brokerage activities. The chairman hopes that a continuation of efforts combined with the present tendencies for values to rise and premiums to be increased, will 4nable the group to expand its brokerage business sufficiently to pro duce profits in 196647 which overall will be comparable with those of Meeting, Winchester House, B.C., October 14, at noon.

DERBYSHIRE STONE The selective employment tax is resll \" a forced loan on Industry to the overnment,\" Mr. John Ha d chairman of - tDiylv Sto., told shareholders yesteday. Speaking at the annual meeting in Caxton Hall, he said that on the present basis it would cost the com- pany about Â£150000 a year. How. ever, the amount eeded to finance the tax, irrespective of the actual annual cost, would be in the region of Â£250000. \"It was Iniultous that company finances should be Impaired In that manner,\" he thought, and It was only equitable if the Government said e are borrowing from Derbyshire Stone 250,000 and we will pay yotu\" as any borrower should, \"a reason- able rate of interest.\" Mr. Hadfield concluded by exress ing confidence in the future of the group and of its growth potential given reasonable conditions. Meeting Page 6 WALTER WRAGG Although the directors of Walter Wrag are takng all possible steps to restore profitability der the difficult conditions now prev1iling they say that it may be that losses during the last six months of the year could o=et, and possibly exceed, profits made in the first halt. For the pre- vious 14 months' period to Dec- ember 31, 1965. a dividend of 17' per cent. was paid. During the first half of the current year, sals of motor cycles followed the national decline but sales of cars and three-wheelers increased, so that the company was able to maintain a satisfactory overall turnover and profit. However, Government actions, par. ticularly hire purchagp restrictions, have brought about a sharp decline in sales during the past few weeks and the company has been. operating at a loss. The Board does not expect any immediate improvement and, in addi. tion, anticipates having to write down the value of stocks over the coming mqnths. WM. DOLAN Wjn.

   "text_content" : "re Mi COOK22 a), (te Chairman) prpddiug. The following i his ciuate statement: Ow New Offies Our new offices were completed in January as we had anticipated nd I am glad to tell you that not iily have the staU settled in admir- ably to their new environment but closer technical and administrativ- collaboration is being achieved be- tween our various pompanies at Sheerwater. Shareholderswill se that we have included in the report this year a coloured photograph of our reception area, which is parti- cularly attractive. Trading RienIt* For the fourth year in succession our steady growth rate has ber. maintained and I have pleasure iu reporting that the profits of the Group have risen by 4% over 1965. Shareholders will recollect that last year the final dividend Was retained at .10% in order to stabilse our profit retention on an assumed Corporation Tax of 40%. The wisdom of itis policy is now evident. With the increase in profit our. directors might well have felt able to reommeAnpd- a final dividend which, withl the thterim dividends already paid, *ould have repre- sented a lightly increased diptribu. tion as compared with last year. However, in respoiase to the Gov- ernment's appeal . the Board has dedided to tecoaend a final divi. ,dead of 5%, bringing the total for the year to l4%; the same as last year. , Analy.is ,es aradg. Resulsa In my statement last year I inu- cluded for the fifattinme an analysis of trading results between our furnace divisi6i 'and our chemical ehgineering division. This is noj being repeated as I feel it is of interest to indicate the relative con- tributions of sIlis And profits made by each division.: Inter-company transactions have been excluded. Divison iron pi ce mpettion botb at home and overseas. DveloWpment- during the year in electronically controlled automatic electro-plat- ing and pickling macries' havo rensulted 1h redced maargins on some contracts but have enabled the Company to introduce more flexible and sophisticated machine. Increasing in disatin of sub- massembbwiesll permit acceptable delivery dates and prices to be maintained for our wide range o. automatic machines. An- important new Efco-Udylite process known as Cromylite has been introduced.. This is an im- proved chromium plating process which minimises plating defects and should find a ready market. Good progress has also been made with a new bright tin plating pro- cess which has good applications in the electrical and food industries as an alternative to hot tin dipping. A separate division has been formed to handle industrial wash- ing machines and associated chemical products and there has been steady increase in the volume of orders received. The division manufacturing and elling air filters under a licence agreement with Deltech Engineer ing Inc. has completed its second year with good results. Those filters have in particular been well received by manufacturers and users of compressed air instrumen- tation. The range of products handled by the division has been expanded and it is anticipated that a useful contribution to our profits will result. Other Interests Shareholders will see from the table on page 6 that the Efco interests include a number of Com- panies which are not subsidiaries but which are closely associated in managemefit. I- am suftr it is of interest to learn of the progress of these Companies. AcmeoEfco Limited has had a satisfactory year and in addition to vislon 7 - Sales Trading Prolfti Percentage 1966 1965 1966 1965 19661965 Â£ Â£ Â£ Â£2 % % Furnace .. . ,759,032 2,287,450 220,104 185,983 8.0 8.1 Cimicl BUnr . ....2,640,604 2221,394 249,504 252,753 9A 11.3 5, . 399,P63k Â£4,5088 4 .9i 08 438j,736 ' .7 9.7 ,Gus- Diurigirn As eQune of the year I tecommenled, on behalf of the Board, acceptance of an offer by the Udylitb Corporation of Detroit to acquire a 15% interest in the Company. The. response to the offer was very satisfactory. In December we leased two small factories 'at Colabrook, Bucking. hamshire. Thes premises are occ pied partly by Foundry and Meiallurgical'Equipment Company Limited and partly by the mechani. cal handling company, Jonge Poetink Wire Mesh Belts & Con. veyors Limited.' Foundry and Metallurgicpal Equipment Company Limited has therefore been relo. cated and provided with extra floor space to enable it to operate as a separate manitfaturing and selling unit. Ftraim Divsion Of the compaides and' divisions in this Oroup, Efco Furnaces Limited hbas produced the highest ncrease in proiflt, The sales of this Company during the year have been increased again with the pro. vision of special fnaoce equipment for Plklnjton' Bros. Ltd. for use with that Comrany' new float glass ptoos thrbuhout the world, We are proud to be so closely associ ated in this substantial develop. ment and of our close technical liaison with Pilklogtons. Our *ffort in the supply and development of vacuum heat treatment furnaces has continued on a modest scale, particularly in annealing furnaces for steel wire and copper tubing, We have also developed highly speciallsed vacuum brazing tebniques for the aircraft industry, The two overseas subsidiaries, BRo Industrieoten A.O., Switzer. nd and Bfoo South Africa, have continued to make steady progress and improved profits have been made from Switzerland. The con* tribution from Bfoo South Africa has been reduced but the growth potential of this Company is excellent. The work In hand for both companies is satisfactory, A further increase n turnover has enabled Royce Electric PFur naces Ltd. to absorb increased uosts, thereby ensuring that its prices remained competitive.

Last year was one of. the most inflationary periods since the war. both as far a prices of ferrous and non- ferrous metals are concerned, and also Wage advances. Moreover. selling prices are difficult to in- *' crease if we are to maintain our markets both at home and abroad. In spite of this. we view the future with optimism and I am sure you would wish me to express on your behalf our thanks to all our employees aWo are particularly concerned with the prosperity of Efco and are equally conscious of the difficulties with which we could be faced.

   "text_content" : "Coast Lines Limited The Fifty-Third Annual General Meeting of Coast Lines Limited was eld in London on September 22nd. The Chairman. Sir Arnet Robinson, in the course of his speech said:- The Consolidated Profit and Loss Accounti shows that after providing for depreciation, future special surveys and deferred repairs and after taking credit for substantially increased income by way of interest, the trading profit for the year 1965 amounted to Â£1,325,100 as compared with Â£1,741,186 for the previous year, the decrease mainly' resulting from the inability to absorb or recoup adequately substantial increases in costs. The net profit for the year attributable to Coast Lines Limited was Â£1,017,271. Two interim dividends, each of 7% per cent., have been paid on the Ordinary Stock in January and July 1966 respec- tively, the total paid being 15 per cent. as for the previous year. Your Board does not recommend the payment ofa final dividend on the Ordinary Stock. The general pattern throughout our shipping activities during the year showed a steady rise in operating, terminal and main- tenance coasts. Year after year I have made reference to this and it would be illusory to suggest that the sharp flse in our chief operating costs in 1965 compared with 1964 could be entirely absorbed by altered methods or better sproductivity.\" New ideas to increase Webiciency were introdisced wherever possible and freight rates were increased but the combined effect of these measures was insufficient to cover the increase in working expenses. The result was that despite a reasonably high degrie of activity most services produced a lower bet return and in some instances the more marginal services became unprofitable. ThA year generally was one of expansion in some directions, contfaction in others. Our road haulage companieq had an active y6ar and expansion continued. The Report and Accounts were adopted.",

Most of the participants in the cnference are going straight to Washington to-morrow, aid ithe British and Canadian Ministers will be taking jat a Miniterial meeting of tM Group of Ten on Sunday. The most notable aspect of to- ay's discussions, as of yesterday's dbate on the world economic ituation and on sterling, was its relaxed and reasonable tone. Many observers had. for instance, ex- pected thet dcjpped oamui British and Canadian Governments or acceptik the 9W'psAh 'of. the Group of Ten'fdr the next otsse of the liquidity discussions. Under his plan. the participation of the ess developed countrire through their directors on the I1F Board will, after all. b slight. None of this criticism emerged. In fact the divergenies between the U.K. and Canada on the one hand and the less developed countries on the other wpro con- centrated in tweomaip areas: 1-The less.developed countries Iare anxious that the machinery for making dicisions' on the increase of new reserves should not be entirly domiasted by tha rich Group f Tfen ounto. ea. The U.K. and Canada have pointed out that it would be unrealistic to suppose that the rich countries -from whom real resources will ultimately be transferred by the gjnqral distribution of nev reserves-will not in practice control their creation. 2-Tbe :less-developed countries argue that the creation of new reserves is necessary because of the financial difficulties of developw tent. The U.K. and Canada hav 44plied, it a softened torin of the Continental position, that the need for liquidity is contingent on the overall needs of world trade, and that the answer to the difflrultles of individual developing countries is areater aid. In general, there has been an atmosphere of rather weary opti- mism here about the prospects for the liquidity negotiations. Officials take comfort from the decision of the French Government to take part in the next stage, for they regard this as being the result of the French realisation that France *had become dangerously isolated on this issue from her EEC partners. Interest Rates There has naturally been a great deal of discussion on development aid, and much of the emphasis has been on highb interest rates, which are seriously alarming the less developed countries. The Jamaican Government, which intends to raise Â£3ms. in othe London market this year, .and the New Zealand Government, which shortly has to tefinance a Â£10m. London issue, both expect to have to pay at least 7% per cent. The British view has apparently been that world rates have now reached more or less a peak, and that if, as expected, the U.S. Government introduces tax in- creases next January they should actually begin to fall.

Thee resultsare disappointing, but times are not easy and manu- factutera of household consumer goods are having to face many problems. Traditional Axminster carpet manufacture,. which is by far the largest part of our activities. showed a marked drop. in prost- ability and 'even although the results are aided byt the profitable spinning of carpet yarn within the Group, the year showed a drop in profits of about 25 per cent on the traditional side. This drop was partly aecounted for by a fall of sime 6 perceht. in turnover, which resulted in. a lower recovery of ovheadÃ½, but to a much ureater *aMent butire ases.in manufactur- ing and selling costs. Substantial increases ia costs arose and the savings we have been able to achieve,. considerable though they are, have not offset the cost rises. To meet this sitfation, at least in part, certain of our Axminster qualities er ode ratly licreased in price in, April of,this year. If turnover can be maintained, our position should not deteriorate. Glenvle Carpets Ltd., our tufted subsidiary, in its second year of coinmmercial operition, has again made a loss. Unless restrictions of quite abnormal severity, are in- flicted upon consumer goods gener- ally, the 'tufted division should operate profitablv during (he year ended May, 1967. All other subsidiaries performed satisfactorily daring the year. Having referred to the grant to the Company of the Royal War- rant as Carpet Manufacturers to Her Majesty The Queen, the Chairman referred to futuie pros- pects and said: 4 . i I im not pssmntl in that I expect us to hold our position in the industry, but I would .not ex- pect the industry as a whole to operate more rofttabl' during the coming year thl1 in tme year just closed.

Limitea, .was formed to be responsible to the Board of your Company for the manae- mient of the units engaged in Dye- ing and Finishing. This unit, which cofhttibuteq the major portion of the Company's profit, found con- ditions more difcult than in the previous year and whilst it main- tained its turnover at the same level, it was unable to increase this .ufficiently to absorb increased. costs, resulting in a modest fall in, profits. All sections make their contributions to the profit with the exception of Textile Decorative Co. Ltd. Although results here snow sotile improvement on last year, we have made a further loss. Under a major reorganisation the profitable part of this work will be transferred to our Wilford Road factory and we propose to sell our factory at Long Baton. Kaitwear DivisYo Our Kniitwear division, Health- guard, Doltone and Walter Hender son, has shown mixed results. The Healthguard unit has shota a fur- ther useful increase in profit. although it was unable to derive full benefit anticipated from its new extension due to late delivery and delay in commissioning its ne* machinery.

' Howevet; on information, at present available. now the new machinery Is effective, this unit appears 'to be operating profitably. - Walter Henderson A Co. Ltd. the manufacturing unit, which, we acquired at the beginning of the year has had a satisfactory year and has made a small contribution t your Company profit. . The not loss on the Knitwear Division for the year hat had the effect of reducing sabstantially the pros!t of the group before taxation. It must be borne in mind, however. that the products of this ,divilion provide a sqod deal of work for the dying and -bleaching comr panis cndthat w re engaged on a long term and essential effort tb broaden thd base of the group' aetlvitiqs. The Cortm Year The Pysing, Company which usually contributes the major por tion of our profit has found trade very slow for the last three months. This, together with the holiday period will give a poor hnlf-year, Wlth the manufacturing comoanl-s the outlook is brighter. Health guard should turn In substantial profits and on the available in- formation Dolton. is now operat- Ing at a smal profit. Any forecast for the current year must be tempered in the ligh of the difl ,ult financial and poltical state or the country, but I expect the Com- pany to show a small profit for the current six months, The Report and Accounts were unanimously adopted and the final dividend of 6% was approved,",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN A SMALL but select field of two- year-olds will line up for the . Royal Lodge Stakes (3.50), run over the Old Mile at Ascot this .afternoon. Indeed, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the winner of the 1967 Derby is in- cluded among the runners, the best of whom T take.to be Starry Halo, Allanton and Royal Palace. Starry Hale., a chesnut colt by Aureole, has run twice; the first when winning a maiden race at York at the beginning of July, and next when scoring an impressive victory in the New Ham Stakes at Goodwood. Both races were over six furlongs, but there is no doubting his ability to stay a mile. The pedigree of Allanton is also chock full of stamina and this bay colt by Aggressor was convincing when he won ovqr seven furlong at Newbury last month, his only race to date. However, the prob- ability is that this valuable prize will be won by NW MuMuW who took it *tq*ny t-' t*$wIs. This: fterpooiu r n - tive is ,Mr,. . ' 0oyal Palace, a Ballypsi obilt who, after showing promise behind Bold Ltd in the Coventry Stakes at R6yal Ascot, was a comfortable winner of the Acomb Stakes at York. He is a good looking colt with scope for improvement and is my idea of -the winner. Unless there is a useful new- comer in the field, the Waterford Stakes (2,0) for .two-year-olds will probably be won by Colonel-i- Chief, a nice type of colt by rincely Gift out o( a Couri Matial mare, and Loose Cover has improved to such an extent in recent weeks that I would. not be surprised to see her get the better of the 1,000 Guineas runner-up, Berkeley Springs, for the Rosemary Stakes (3.20). The Bracknell Nursery Stakes (4.20) is a tricky event and is prob. ably best left alone. But Crocua. who will get the firm going that he likes, appeals as a sound bei for the Wild Boar (4.50). Lady Marid Bury's Psldlum colt seems to be exceptionally well treated here with only 8 at 1 lb to carry. In the abence of Parthlaw.Glance, Predlmcaent looks suie to win the Princea I'tv&i SafrKa 12A?.M",

   "text_content" : "dy Our Textiles Correqumndent Output of industrial fibres for 196566 is likely to reach a new peak, owing to higher production of cotton and man-made fibres, according to Industrial Fibres, the annual review published by the Commonwealth AEconomic Committee. Production of other fibres includina wool. irte. far and silk. r- - - is likely to show a reduction, the review states. For many sectors of the world textile industry 1965 was one of considerable difficulty, says the review. Although textile output was greater overall than in 1964, the impact of competition-both between different fibres and between the textile products of different countries - tended to become more acute. The newer sypthetic fibres made a fu-ther malrked advance, their output being one-fifth higher than in the previous year, but in many countries both the rayon and the wool industries did .less well. The wool industry suffered a sharp cyclical recession in mid-1964, which in most countries began to lift only in the latter part of 1965, apart from the U.S., where recovery came earlier. The cotton industry made good progress in the U.S., where raw cotton prices were sharply reduced by government action, in Japan, and in many of the developing countries, but its position in the Common Market countries and in the U.K. was less satisfactory, the review adds. The linen industry remained rela- tively depressed, as did the hard fibres industry, where competition from synthetics assumed increasing importance. Theijute industry's sup. plies of raw materials were subject to difficulties, accentuated by the outbreak of hostilities between India and Pakistan. The silk industry showed a marked recovery, limited only by lack of raw material.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Mining Editor Although the Rustenbnrg group of platinum dividends for the past year are unchanged, as expected, there is plenty in last night's state- ment from this major South African producer to explain Johannesburg's enthusiasm for the shares of the holding companies, Potgietersrust, Waterval and Union Platusss, in recent months. The long-term outlook for the metal is now regarded as sufficiently strong for the further scheme of expansion to be put in hand at a cost of around Â£ I Im. over the four years to August, 1970, of which some Â£7.Sm. is ex- pected to be spent during the two years to August, 1968. Moreover, if sales continue at levels equal to Rustenburg's expand- ing productive capacity it should be possible, with the aid of medium-term loans, to finance this programme from the company's resources while achiev- ing \" some small annual increments in dividends.\" Meanwhile, the present temporary expansion scheme should be making its impact on mine production in the second half of 1967. The further supplies now envisaged should be reaching the market during 1969. The overall capacit tenburg's two mines should round 0.75m. ounces of plat annum com- pared with 0 in the year to Augut, 19 uction at the from t ond the pia be in excess of m rements, but if sales during fve years should revert t t levels divi- dends may sti ntainable at about their presnt rates.

   "article_dc_title" : "Jorrocks",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "by B. A. YOUiIG One of the characteristic that. distinguish fox-hunting op from the others is that they thnk Jorrocks is funny. Non-fox-alunti\" people may find the works of Surtees interesting from the literary or the sociological point of view, but they can seldom be seen rolling on the carpet as they succumb helplessly to the humounrs of the hunting field. I have followed hounds in my time (on foot), but the mystic fas- cination of the chase is not for ime. Though I think literature would be the poorer without Surtees, I must therefore be'aurw bered among those who do not find him uproarious; and as for John Jorrocks himself, tea- merchant,- MPH, vulgarian and bully, he seems to me one of the miost unlovable characters ever invented. So when I say that I found the new musical at the New predominantly dull. I have to qualify it by conceding that I know there is a faction that will find it side-splitting. The production leans very hard on Surtees as a humorist. The book that Beverley Cross has ex- tracted from the immortal works is a singularly well-made one; it is coherent, it keeps the interest going, it has pace. But the fun in it, which is provided with a lavish hand, is Surtees-type fun. We have to laugh at the old boy's boorish- ness when he gatecrashes Lady Barnington's dinner-party, at his accent (early-Victorian Cockney), at his whimsical turns of speech (\"'the liver and bacon of life \"), at his enthusiasm (\" what joy!\") I am thrown back, then, on the music, the spectacle, the singing and the dances. The music I found as insipid as Handley Cross water. It sounds just like the music in almost any other recent British musical-up and down the triads, up and down the scale, tonic-and-dominant harmonies (with an occasional dashing diminished seventh), jog- trot rhythm, and the arrangements spattered with every clich6 in the business. The lyrics, like the music .the work of David Heneker, are equally banal. The songs always sound as if the authors had said \" We have to have a number here \" and had put one in from a sense of duty; they never have that feeling of urgency that you get from a song that springs naturally from the situation and actually adds soumws thn to the emotional set-up. The dances seem to me to reach the nadir of current popular chdreography, and the choreogra- pher's name is wisely left out of the proramme. The saging is on the whole bet ter than the songs deserve. Joss Ackland plays Jorrocks wit much panache, his teeth shining in his round moon face, his eyes poppini out of their sockets with exophthaI- mic, excitement at the image of war without its guilt and only five- and-twenty per cent. of its danger (a description applied nowadays to Rangers v. Celtic matches, with the percentage suitably increased). He has a strong, tuneful voice, and if one could love Jorrocks at all, one would love him. Romance is taken care of by Cheryl Kennedy as Jorrocks's neice Delinda; her voice is small but true, but her only good song is sung not to her beloved Charlie Stobbs but to her uncle, who is about to be certified as insance at the instance of the justly dis- turbed Lady Barnington. Charlie is played by Bernard Lloyd, whose voice is equally pleasant but equally small. (I must qualify these judgments by saying that I was in Row B and heard the real thing; those whose sound was delivered by microphone may have had a better deal.) Subsidiary comedy is provided by Paul Eddingtdn as Captain Doleful, who interpolates a touch of subtlety in some of his lines seldom discernible elsewhere, and by Thelma Ruby as Mrs. Jorrocks and Helen Lindsay as Lady Barn- ington-stereotpyds both, but boldly realised. The comedy of Peter Whitbread as James Pigg, the drunken, unintelligible huntsman from Cannynewcastle, is simply not my cup of tea, though it was clear that it was going exactly as it was meant to go. Too much of the comedy, though, seems to have been grafted on to the main body to preserve it from petrifaction-Doleful's delivery of the line \"a captain of foot,\" for example, which made me think wistfully of Sir Henry Lvtton, and a lot of business about falling off chairs. Can Val May, the director, have decided at the last moment that unadulterated Jorrocks was not funny enough? I'd be with him there; but sterner measures are reruired.",

   "text_content" : "by JOHN .HItGINS \"I suppose since they uplled down the old Met in the Edgware Road there's nowhere else.\" So Tony Hancock at the beginning of his act last night, peering at the Festival Hall and its audience with an old glowering Railway Cuttings look that foresaw nothing but a chain of trials and tribulations. He should not have worried too much. It was an agreeable, knock- about turn; perhaps not worth thirty bob in the front stalls-if that is what they were for the critics' seats were valued at twenty shilling-but then Hancock characteristically admitted the fact. The ingredients were mainly familiar and were affectionately greeted by the audience like old friends. There were the faces: the Mutiny on the Bounty one Trevor Howard or Charles Laughton, you take your pick; the Treasure Island one-Robert Newton or Bernard Miles, ditto; the Hunchback of NAtre Dame; and, best of all, the Gaumont British News. There were the voices that suddenly used to rip through East Cheam-Olivier, Churchill. There was even a slightly self-indulgent extract from \"The Blood Donor.\" But something was missing, or rather several things. The sight of that body with the anxious air of a bookie trying to decide whether or not to welsh is no compen. salion for the television cameras roaming over the contours of that remarkable face which is Han. cock's greatest asset, (Happily th- cameras were there is force at the back of the stalls, but not, alas, for closed circuit reproduction.) From the terrace, let alone from the upper reaches of the house, there wits no possibility of lingoring on those great hooded eyes which can display crushing disdain and then creep furtively back under the brows; no chance of watching the plump lips curling down with disgust or drooping in defeat. There lacks too a foil. The voice wis not truly brought Into play last night, there were none ors those memorable dialogues from the Railway Cuttings that quickly transformed into h styrical monologues. Sid, Sid, where art thou? The act at the moment gives the impression that it Is still in the making, But It hasi two sturdy props: the glories of the past and one of the most instantly sym. pathetic comic personalities to have emerged since the war, While searching for the right formula Tony Hancock could egin by giving the first half of the hill Its cards, Tony Hatch played a number of composniions, mainly his own, on the piano with some faulty fingering and broke off from time to time to conduci his orchestra, mainly while facing the audience, Thereafter Marian Montgomery sang a very great number of songs. They began by being as audible as a Clapham Junction station announcement to a passenger on a through train. Matters improved slightly after some loud advice from the gallery about using the microphone, or better still other microphones. But Miss Mont- gomery's two styles of singing on last night's showing-the smoky adagio and the squally prestissimo -were no more suited to the Festival Hall's atmosphere and acoustics than Stravinsky's Wind Octet would have been to the Met, Edgware Road: to bring us back to where we started.",

   "text_content" : "by ANDREW PORTER At the midday concert on Wed- nesday, the Covent Garden Orchestra under Douglas Robinson gave the first performance of Havergal Brian's Sinfonia Tragica, composed in 1948. For some sixty years Brian, who was 90 last Janu- ary, has been part of our musical scene; immensely prolific, and very seldom played. The Sinfonia Tragics, like the Twelfth Sym- phony heard at the Proms, suggests that we have been missing some- thing. The two works have much in common: the Tragica lasts 18 minutes, the Twelfth twelve; each is at first hearing like an elliptical presentation of a big-scale roman. tic symphony, whose ideas a Mahler or a Shostakovich would have presented an an infinitely vaster time-scale. Brian says things once, perhaps twice; directness of statement and, no elaborate development or recapitulation is his line, So first time through, one never knows what's going to happen next or, when it has happened, why it did, After repeated hear. ings the shntpe and senNe become clearer, Brian writes In the grand manner but on a modern time scale. is gestures are big. The Sinfonia Tralica opens with motifs banged out on drums, shattering gong strokes, themes articulated with cold precision on the glockenspiel, over a wave- figure. The second-subject group has a Wagnerian openness of texture (the Wagner of Tihe Ring, where a single instrument in a far-flung register often carries the bturden), Then a funeral march with a hint of dire Iram about it yields to a romantic episode, a sequential woodwind melody marked by big yearning falls. The finale contains brutal relent. less march fragments, ana, Is In the Twelfth, a final gong stroke shudders Into silence, It sounds chaotic hut Is held together by, as much as anything, the very strong sense th listener has of a powerful mus loal per. sonality at work. Brian's scores have ctoraoter. \"The Swallows\" for the New Arts Tie Swallowo by Roland Dubll lrd aopS a threeIwM sAIon at t1e ge ri The rS ont Goobe? , t a ed at the Rdm ur t a and ran joar I oathsIn Ewes bolon playle ar14%o.an oentre 0shop ow , rim re mgyoung Art is, ola Keai antTE I Wylnt i ermai, Pon Taylor with settings by rlan",

   "text_content" : "by DAVID ROBINSON Group Portrait It Is prlbably lesa iurprising than at fist appears, that Mary McCarthy's The Group tends to attract more readers than actual champions. Beneath' the spry, chic wit and the frighteningly shrewd observation of the wa y American girls think and talk and behave, there is a vein of dark sentiment, of almost mor- bidly defensive feminism. Miss McCarthy's eight heroines- followed from the giggles and ?jtimism of graduation (class of '3) to their self-discoveries as *mature young women on the eve of the World War-have a pretty rough time at the hands of the other sex. The most successful of the mar- riages they make are those of Dottie whose rich husband merely bores her to death, and Pokey, who simply breeds like a rabbit. The rest are subjected to seduction, rape, assault, infidelity, male impo- tence, the domination of brutal husbands and a variety of gynaeco- logical terrors. The only members ors The Group who seem to derive any particular satisfaction from life arq Helena (whose role as looker- on invites identification with the author) who stays single, and Lakey, who sets up house with a leathery German baroness. This air of pessimism and sus- picion of prejudice overlays Sidney Lumet's screen adaptation of The Group (London Pavilion)-an adaptation striking for its attempt to stick at once to the letter and to the spirit of the original, and for its near success in doing so. Sidney Buchman's screenplay, following the book scene by scene interestingly points up the differ- ences between the novel form and the cinema. Somethings the novel can do infinitely better. . I could not help wondering, seeing the film, how easy it can be for audi- ences to pick up the quick verbal exchanges without a previous knowledge of the book. At other points, however, the film, with a gesture or a glance, can convey significances which the writer must labour over for paragraphs. The two long and minutely detailed sec- tions of the book which deal with Dottie's first sexual experience, and her subsequent gynaecological pro- blems (and which, I fear, have sold many more copies of the book than the cleverer areas of Miss McCarthy's legendary wit) are con- veyed very much more swiftly and subtly in Lumet's film. It is perhaps ironic that Nikolai Cherkassov, who died last week at the age of 63, should be best known in the West for the per- formance which, out of all his distinguished career in the theatre and cinema, gave him least satis- faction. A realistic actor, deeply influenced by Stanislavski and the Moscow Art Theatre of the Stanis- lavski regime, he was to the end of his life unhappy about the formalist style imposed upon him by Eisenstein for the title role in Ivan the Terrible: At rehearsals and during the filming Eisenstein never seemed to tire of setting me intricate tasks in movement and action. In the scene in which Ivan the Terrible stands before the coffin of Tsarina Anastasya-a deeply psychological scene-he not only demanded highly emotional acting, but sharply defined outer plastic form, often shackling me by the rigid line of his graphic and artistic thought. Carried away by his en- thusiasm for pictorial composi tion, Eisenstein moulded ex- pressive, monumental mises en scene, but it was often difficult to justify the content of the form he was trying to achieve. In some of his mises en scone, extremely graphic in ideas and composition, an actor's strained muscles often belied his inner feelings. In later years, Cherkassov would, in private, perform wry, comic mimes to demonstrate the contor- tions which had strained his muscles to provide Eisensten's great compositions. But despite his doubts, the actor seems loyally to have co-operated with his direc- The Group, apart from every- thing else, is a triumph of casting. The girls, several of them unknown and none of them stars, really are the Group, looking, talking, seem- ing to think even exactly as the book describes them. I found Shirley' Knight's Polly especially convincing and touching; but the aiscovery or ine mm is ouark Hackett, looking, in her thirties clothes, for all the world like Ruby Keeler, and with a prim little voice and a quaint, twitchy little face that are extraordinarily persuasive. To play Miss McCarthy's men folk has to be a thankles task, of course; the only ma'le figure who emerges with any sort of definition 1 is Robert Emhardt, a sort of latter- - day but more genial Sidney Greenstreet, as Polly's. dear, dotty old father. Cornel Wilde's essays at turning < from acting to direction (Storm i Fear, The Devil's Hairpin, Mara- i caibo) have had only variable i ucceuss, but they havw all displayed t game independence and a readi- sess to experiment. The Naked 5rey (Plaza) is toe oddest and nost interesting of the lot. It is he uncomplicated narrative of a white hunter whose safari is nassacred by an African tribe (the )eriod is 1840) and who is turned oose to be hunted by the best war- iors of the tribe. Naked and with- )ut weapons or food, he is pitted against the jungle, hunger, the )easts and his pursuers. It is more than tempting to guess that Wilde has discovered an admiration for Luis Bufluel. The lubject - a man alone and menaced, and the conflict in him between civilisation and the desperation to survive-is very close .to what Bufluel attempted in Robinson Crusoe. The imagery of the life of the insects too is close to Bufluel: one shot-of fighting scorpions-is even identical to a shot at the beginning of Land Without Bread. Cornel Wilde is not Bufluel, and The Naked Prey cannot pretend to the skill dr the overtones of a Bufluel film. It is tied down to a limited talent, and subject to a taste for gratuitous violence and sadism, to a curious blindness to racial implications. It is for all that hard to withhold admiration for its will to defy the conventions of Hollywood narrative forms and to essay a neo-philosophical theme. The worst thing about The Pad is that it has to be seen in a double bill (on release) with The Trap, which I reviewed, with some distaste, last week. The second worst thing about it is that a successful little one-act play-Peter Schaeffer's The Private Ear has been disproportionately inflated to provide the screenplay for a feature-length film. Everyone concerned does his best The director, Brian G. Hutton has a lively shot at filling it out with Knack-inspired dream fantasies; Brian Bedford is a capable actor, though sometimes inclined to let the mechanics behind his effects show; Julie Sommars, an engaging newcomer, very skilfully engineers the pro- gression from the fantasy idol whom the hero asks round to dinner, to the clay-footed piece who stumps off at the end of the even- ing. But you can't make a big silk purse out of a little silk purse.",

   "text_content" : "tor; and the spectacularly success- ful results Eisenstein attained must in no small measure be credited to Cherkassov's professional accom- plishment and conscientiousness. Born in 1903, Cherkassov's stage career began very soon after the Revolution; and he was from start to finish par excellence the Soviet actor. He went to the Mariinski (now Kirov) Theatre as extra and bit player in opera, and soon had his chance (as a fairground spieler in Serov's Dark Power) to show off his skill as a clown and mime. Chaliapin, then still working in Russia, had to reprimand him for stealing his scenes; and in his auto- biography Cherkassov has left an amusing recollection of the star (\" He was in knee-high white fell boots, and well-fitting fluffy blue sweater, and had a diamond, studded pin in his tie \"). In the atmosphere of youthful, almost frenzied experiment which characterised the Lunacharsky era, Cherkassov found his forte as a mime and grotesque dancer. With Pavel Berezov and another actoi later to become internationall) famous, Boris Chirkov, he created a vaudeville turn, \"Charlie Chap lin, Pat and Patachon,\" which wai popular for years. Subsequentlh he worked in circuses throughoul the Soviet Union. About 1930, however, atter a year at the Moscpw Music Hall which \" was particularly difflcul morally,\" he rtalised that he \" had taken the wrong path and hoear to look for an opportunity to re turn to drama where, I knew, 1 could best use my abilities,\" Al first the transition was difficult; type-casting is not confined to the Western theatre. His dramatic power could not be long ignored, however, and in the remaining 36 years of his life it was more often his comic gifts that were over- looked in the impressive repertory of roles he created, both in the theatre and (from 1926) in the cinema. A, man of striking stature and distinctive features, with a magni- ticent, deep, resonant voice, he had an uncanny gift for changing his appearance, of giving a physical aspect as well as a psychology to his characters. He was able to bring to life a remarkable gallery of Soviet heroes. Apart from the legendary figures of earlier Russian history-Ivan. Alexander Nevsky. the Tsar Aleksei in Peter the Great -he was entrusted with the nervy task of impersonating sacred finures of modern Soviet legend: Gorki, Pavlov, the scientist Timir- zhayev (thinly disguised as Profes- sor Polezhayev in The Baltic Deputy). On the stage he played the role of Vladimir Mayakovski (They Knew Mayakovski, 1955), achieving phenomenal similarities to the great and' fated Soviet poet (whom he had never actually seen) by means of meticulous biographi- al study of his subject. No other actor has succeeded, as Cherkassov did, in conveying to sceptical non- Russian audiences, the meaning and magic which 'these modern heroes have for the Soviet people. Cherkassov was himself some- thing of a Soviet hero and one of his proudest achievements was of having been elected a Deputy to the Soviet. As it happened, Cherkassov's favourite role was not a Russian character at all. Over a period of nearly 40 years he several times returned to the problem of Cer- vantes' Don Quixote. As early as 1919 he doubled for Chaliapin in the windmill scene; later he played the role in both dramatic and pantomime productions. In 1957 he was the brilliant and touching Quixote of the film version directed by Grigori Kozintsev. (The film was shown here in a dubbed ver- sion; Kozintsev is now best known to British audiences for his subsec quent Hamlet.) Apart from being a great actor, Cherkassov was a very nice man; and it was probably his irresistible amiabilitv. more than any abilities as a time-server. that maintained him through succeeding and differ- ing Soviet regimes. He twice visited London in recent years, and with his rich humour and constant urge to clown. proved entirely to have avoided the habitual affectations of the distinguished ageing actor. His departure is to be regretted as human being as well as artist. David Roblnon",
