The scale of these BMC redundancies is about twice as large as was expected when the Corporation announced its plans for cutting production a fortnight ago. The dis- missal notices will be handed to the men on October 10. BMC is going ahead with its plans in spite of the Transport and General Workers' Union's decision yester- day to give official support to a strike by 748 car delivery workers on the issue of redundancy. This strike will result to-day in the laying-off of 18,000 men at BMC's Austin factory at Longbridge, Birmingham, halting all car assembly after the day-shift. a a c I a i- I, r I a IÂ· a 1 t s. I I j a a s a a j d I' n Y II IÂ· a n IÂ· d iÂ· I i' i' I The only section of the Austin works which may continue working is the, engine depart- ment, where 6,500 men are employed. The decision to halt output at the Austin plant is expected to influence many of the 4.000 sup- pliers towards declaring redun- dancies rather than managing on short-time wvorking. In the next week or two the numbers on short time in Midlands forging. casting, glass, trim, component and acces- sory factories could number 100,000. Object is Back to 5-day Week BMC already have 38,600 men on short time and a spokesman said last night that the object of the redundancy \"exercise\" was to get everyone back on a five-day wk. When the reduqdancy plan Mscopltoed there-would be t ets\" t, sbort-time where there was a te3porary sta tories. Mr. Alfred Roberts, general secretary of the Manchester-based National Union of Vehicle Builders, described BMCs announcement as \"pretty terrible\" and said there was every possibility of a special meeting of his executive committee being called this week to discuss it. The car delivery men who went on strike yesterday are employed by the Longbridge Group of Delivery Agents which has given dismissal notices to 360 of the 748 men employed by .the 18 firms in the group. Mr. Harry Nicholas. assistant general secretary of the TOWU, said last night: \"We have done everything we can to get talks with the group, but they are only prepared to talk on the basis of a 50 per cent. redundancy.\" Official Support by TGWU Announcing that the TOWU was giving official support to the strike Mr. Harry Urwin, the union's Midland regional secre- tary, said the actson of the employers in arbitrarily sacking half their labour force was \"provocative and ruthless.\" He added that \" no trade union worth Its salt could fail to support members treated in this .callous The union proposed last week that the car delivery drivers should work alternate weeks, enabling them to quality for unemployment Augudt Car Output Rises Page 20; Editorial benefit for their \" off \" weeks. But the employers rejected this plan. It appears that national officials of the TGWU might have been preparedto accept the dismissal of a small 4umber of the Birming- ham car delivery men. But they are incensed about the employers' plan for cutting their labour force in half. They will protest about this to Mr. Ray Gunter. Minister of Labour, when they meet him in London to-morrow. Representatives of all the firms in the Longbridge Group of Delivery Agents are to meet at Birmingham to-day, and it is expected that they will later issue a statement giving their reasons for dismissing such a large proportion of their labour force. The strike spread yesterday to Liverpool and Oxford, where car delivery men employed by three firms'decided to take protest action in sympathy with the Birmingham men.

The council decided to send a telegram to Mr. Frank Cousins, general secretary of the TOWU. opposing the union's lin- flexible policy of opposition to redundancy. The telegram said that the Liver. pool council, including members under notice of dismissal. unani. mously condemned the Birming- ham Car Delivery Council's decision to oppose redundancy as shortsighted, impragticable and not In the interests of the members. A spokesman for the- council said later that all Its members would be willing to share work if this would provide a solution to the problem. But to share the work of about 25 men between 70 was to their way of thinking of practicable benefit neither to their members nor to the firm A speclal meeting of the Birminig ham branchof the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions will to-day consider the motor industry's troubles.

   "article_dc_title" : "Valuing the Divided Investment Trusts",
   "text_content" : "By LEX By L Another very quiet day in Stock Markets ended with no significant change in the general price level. The share index was unchanged at 306.1. Split Trusts Those who rushed headlong into the new split level investment trusts are now better placed tro savour the truism that gearing works both ways. However, partly thanks to the initial investment policies-New Throgmorton. for example, had invested little more than a quarter of its funds in equities by the beginning of August -and partly to the basic idea, capital shareholders have not done too badly. The point is that as the value of the invested funds falls, so the degree of gearing in-, creases. Once the market is some- where near the bottom, therefore, the tendency will be for the proe- mium over asset value to grow. since it only requires a small re- covery in share prices to push up asset value smartly. Thus despite an initial gearing ration 40 times higher than average Triplevest's capital .shares have only fallen 27 against the index's 18 per cent. drop from the 1966 peak to 15s 6d. They are still use- fully above asset value and if capital growth from now averages the 3% per cent. a year seen since 1920, asset value after gains tax in 20 years' time would be 57s lid. On this basis Triplevest emerges from Myers' study as the best capital bet. for its indicated net annual compound growth rate is half a point ahead of the field at 8.3 per cent. How does one assess the income stocks? The first point is that there is currently an irrationally wide spread of redemption yields. rang- ing from 7.4 to 12.2 per cent. Special factors account for the ex- tremes. and the whole exercise de- pends in part on the assumptions made on dividend growth. Even so the spread is too wide to persist. Secondly, what will happen to the price as it, is tugged upward by rising dividends 'and then down again by redemption at par ? Tak. ing a constant redemption yield the price would peak after eight years. From then on there will still be a handsome income stream to he off- set by a capital loss. The only way of dodging this package is to stick to New Throgmorton which has no fixed life and so should be valued on flat ld .eonsidbrations alone. % Bryant Holdings The warning from Redland last week that the dividend would be cut this year did nothing to revive confidence in building shares, though they have already dropped over a fifth since last February. Nor are Bryant Holdings' results going to help. On the contrary instead of the forecast profit of Â£800,000 before tax the actual amount is Â£714,000 with the fore- cast of a drop this year. However unlike Redland it does not follow that the dividend will be chopped as well. The unchanged 10', per cent. rate is coverad 2.9 times by earnings ex-investment allowances so even halved profits would only reduce cover to the norm. On the other hand leaving the dividend intact does not mean the share price will follow suit. Foi instance if profits halved this year to the prospective price/earnings ratio at 12s 1 Yd would be 16 times and the yield 5 per cent.-hardly an attractive combination. Build ing shares are rapidly losing their growth label, acquired in the last couple of years; Bryant's perform ance can only drive another nail in that particular coffin. See also Page 14 Commercial Union Commercial Union is continuing to grind away successfully at its losses. Thus although .the U.S. underwriting loss fell in the first six months by a comparatively modest Â£200,000 to Â£1.9m. the group has made considerably more ground elsewhere and overall the losses are down from Â£2.2m. to Â£1.2m. in the first half. The interim dividend is unchanged at 20 per cent. The group's success outside the U.S. is largely owed to Canada and Australia contributing around a fifth of premiums. Clearly CU. together with all the other composites, is waiting for the hurricane season to do its worst. However. given the absence of a giant size version like Betsy it looks as though CU is finally on the point of covering its dividends This year about a fifth of the divi dend cost will be covered bv franked investment income. Thus even excluding transitional relief -and CU gets a little-it looks as though the underwriting side can afford to turn in a small loss. say Â£lm. or so, without the divi. dend being short-earned. CU, which until the last few years had a far worse record than Royal in the U.S., has currently dropped behind Royal in the com- posites league table; at 40s 6d it yields 5.6 per cent. againt Royal's S per cent. One reason for the gap was that Royal looked nearer to covering its dividends a point which is now disproved. See also Page, IS Second Premier After Consolidated Trust's ex. ample it was fairly predictable that the rest of the 117 Old Broad Street group of investment trusts would follow suit over Second Premier. The reasons given are. first, that in 11 out of the 16 cases some directors are probably legally accountable anyway, and secondly that they do not want to expose themselves to accusations of a con. flict of interest h Ia Atlantic Assets This leaves BET and Rediffusion. who are firmly buttressed by their legal opinions If little else.

Under its.in- fluence the spot price rose Â£5 7s 6d inst week, and by Saturday it had passed the Â£102 mark-the first time the cash price bad exceeded the producers' standard price for almost six months.

Until this happens a price more. in line with previous forecasts cannot be ex- pected. Earlier in the year a continued fall in the price of the metal was in prospect; indeed, as October approached and consumers of zinc would be re-negotiating the con- tracts on which they buy their metal, the persistently low prices of the free market were expected to force producers to drop their price from its current level of Â£102 a ton.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staff my urn come THE SEARCH for an effective I international sugar agreement was t resumed in London yesterday with t the assembly of the Preparatory I Working Group on Sugar. With a 22 countries invited-they include I major beet and cane exporters I and, except for China, all import- ant importers-there are hopes that the group will find a basis for i negotiation. Should this be done it is under- stood that the Secretary-General of the.UN Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Dr. Raul Prebisch, wishes to call a full Sugar Conference sometime during the first six months of 1967 to re-establish a working agree- ment. The Commonwealth sugar pro- ducing countries agreed on a ioint aproach for the meeting earlier this month, but the prospects for a full international Sugar Agreement remain bleak.' Indeed. there were I unconifirmed reports in London yes- I terday that Cuba. one of the world's largest sugar producers, was not bothering to attend. The main difficulty in finding a basis for a pact lies in the fact that unlike many commodities such as cocoa and coffee, sugar can be I grown in almost every country of the world. either in the form of beet or cane. Furthermore, the producers are by no means neces- sarily developing countries.. Any price support system therefore will be infinitely more difficult to operate. and does not automatically come within the UNCTAD aim of increased export earnings for the developing world. On the other hand the need for an agreement remains as strong as ever. The free market sugar price has once more fallen to Â£14 10s. its lowest level since the war. and there are no signs of any sub- stantial improvement in the fore- seeable future.",

Mr. Mekki Abbas. Speaking yesterday at the, open ing session of the international Conference on Mechanisation and the .World's Rice at Stoneleigh, Warwitkshire, he said that despite the real progress made in rice pro* dutob since 1950, in the Far East and other developing regions, the rate of growth in production had been slowing down in alarming \" On a per-caput basis,. indeed. world supplies of rice have shown little improvement for five years and . recent seasons have been charatieriase by shortages, rising prices and record imports. It is this stginatlop in production that led drectly to this year's food crisis in India, which is basically a rice crisis.\" Intake Rising \" Rice isithe staple food for. more than half the human race; about 150m. tons of it are already eaten every year and consumption is con* .tinually rising. The total require- ments are likely to leap to around 250m. tons over the next 20 years.\" The conference. running from terday to October , was organised by the Massey.Fer uson Company as a contributio t6 FAO's International Rice Year. Mr. Abbas said Informa- tion, from more. than 30 countries taking an active part in the Rice Year showed that rice-producing countries were relying more on wider applica tion of present scientific knowledge than on new research to increase pro dpctivity. Better conatrol of rigatio waters was being attained. improved varieties of rice were coming- into wider use. double cropping was being introduced to new areas and there was a steady. if slow. increase in fertiliser use. All of these measures were helping to increase yields. raise the incomes of rice producers' and to bring mechanised methods within their reach.",

There are practically no tenanted farms;; Northern Ireland shares in the benefits of the Land Purchase Acts. which applied to the Republic before independence as well.

SNo Security The systeinm t''ind' to encourage bad farnlIg practio there is no security oC-le5utsri beyond one year, so there is nc incentive to farm for fertility, 01 the long-term. But, on the othel hand there is the advantage thai an elderly farme can e@utre at income from hti land, 'thiit way, i until a son or a relative is old enough to take over. It would be invidious 'to pick out any single one of the farms I visited. I -would -rather paint a composite picture of what could be typiel of the progressive I farmer in the province Pifteen yeas ago Jack Smith * succeed to nis u '.i. 60 acres in County Down. It was, in those days. conventionally mixed: growing flax for linen, rye- grass seed. barley, oati. potatoes. roots Mfr stock and short leys. There were eight milking cows, 20 ewes, two sows and a few calves were reared for beef. Fields were small and divided by high and unkept hedges. I Over the years, and with a great deaf of help from the very prac- tical Advisory Services, he has comns to specialise in cows. with a small sideline, in fattening pigs. Cows were chosen because grass is by far the easiest crop to grow. and the pigs make use of the spare buildings. The grass is nearly all permanent pasture these days. and on the 60 acres he carries 45 milk- ing cows. and 25 young cattle. He rents 10 acres on Conacre to grow barley for feed and straw for bed- ding his cows. Farming is now a routine; the majority of the cows calve in the autumn, because although the bulk of the milk in Northern Ireland poes tp the low-priced manufactur- ing market. the farmer receives a price based on the total U.K. guar- antees and this favours winter milk. The cows are in from late October until April because the land is too wet, self-feeding silage from the clamp in the covered yard. and bedding down in the cubicles along. side. Jack and his one man milk them in the modern milking parlour twice a day, clean the yard with a tractor and scoop. rear the calves and feed the pigs. It is a fairly dull routine and not particularly hard work. In summer, though, there is more to do. Jack uses a lot of nitrogen and the pastures are grazed rotationally and have to be top dressed after every Iced, six or eight times ino all. Main summer work is sllage making; .thrjo on an through *twe aion ui 400 or 500 tons has Wiled the clamp. On a large farm with sveral tract6 this quantity can be easily made in a week or so and a then sealed against deterioration. Because Jack has to do it little and often, he has to seal the clamp with a polythene sheet between cuts. Silage making is fairly well mechanised these days but it's a dull job, the clamp grows almost imperceptibly and the constant scaling and unsealing has to be methodically done. Marketing Boards Financially it is a prosperous business because Jack applies him- self to it with patience and persist- \" ence. He is the first to admit that he owes a great deal to the help he receives from the Advisory Service, and wishes he had had the time when he was young to spend a year at one of the agricultural colleges. His own son will be going for certain, and the present Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Harry West, is trying to ensure that every new- comer to Ulster farming will have had this sort of training. Because he does much of the work himself Jack has no time for farming politics or local govern- ment. His main products, milk and bacon pigs, are marketed by boards. He has, therefore, little scope for market going. He has no ambition to get bigger. because he knows that a larger acreag is almost impossible to acquire. So he is content and satisfied, perhaps a little too satisfied with his lot. His only anxiety, and one most of his neighbours seem to share, is the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, or rather one clause in it that pro- vides a subsidy for Eire abattoirs. Can it be that a British Govern- ment, forgetting decades of loyalty to the Crown, is subsidy-wise going to treat both sides of the Border alike? A students' hostel at Greenmount Agricultural and Horticultural College, County Antrim. Plans are under way for the establishment of three new agricultural colleges in the province. ____ ____________ 4",

   "text_content" : "ALTHOUGH the cereal harvest has been less expensive to gather than ih 1965, overall yields and quality have been rather disap- pointing, said Mr. S. T. Skelton, president of the National Associa- tion of Corn and Agricultural Merchants in London yesterday. Because of better harvesting con- ditions than last year and the lower moisture content of most grains. this season's harvest has been much less difficult and there had been no drying problems, he said. But he indicated that yields generally were likely to be slightly down on'Tast year: This decr&ast' to gather By Our Commodities Staff was likely to be greater in spring- sown than in winter-sown varieties. However. yields of spring-sown oats were expected to show an overall increase, particularly in Eastern England from Kent up to Lincolnshire. Mr. Skelton went on: \"It is early yet to give a reliable estimate of the final U.K. crop, for, although the harvest is virtually complete in the South of Englnd and East Anglia. much femains t1 be har'vsted in Scot. land and parts of Northern England. \" But. given reasonable conditions for the remainder of the harvest. it would seem that a total U.K. crop of nearly 14m. tons. made up of about 3.75m. tons of wheat. approaching 9m. tons of barlev and 1.25m. tons of oats. could be achieved. ' \"This compares with total U.K. n production of 13.3m. tons in n 1965-66. of which wheat contribu- n ted 4.1m. tons and barley just over 0 8m. \" The U.K. cereal acreage of about y 9.3m. acres is over 300.000 acres up e on 1965. but. while barley waa up e by over 14 per cent., the acreage of e wheat and oats were down by 10 per * cent. ndJ 2 per centreL. aCtSpi \" t: he added."

   "text_content" : "Froa Our Wail Street Correupoldeat 'NARROW AND IRRBtULAR .jnovements prevailed on Wall Street to-day following some late buying, after extending last week's losing tendency much of the session. After a day's high and low of 797.32-784.46, the Dow Jones Industrial Average regained 1.73 to 792.70. The Rallroad ndex rallied 0.89 *to 197.67 but the Utilities Index softened 0.03 to 126.57. Volume expanded 400,000 Shares-mostly in the last half-hour --to 4.96m., and comprised 1,397 issues of which 555 advanced while 572 declined. Helping to attract early selling was concern over Vietnam, pos- sibility of a U.S. tax increase and continued firmness of money rates. A member of a large Investment Banking firm believed that \"no appreciable\" relief from high interest rates was likely before mid-1967. Buying reflected some good company earnings, or prospects, Administration economic opinion that there would be no business recession in 1967 and prospects of increased U.S. corporate capital .expenditures abroad this year with- out any major adverse effects on the U.S. balance of payments. Short covering aided some of the more volatile issues. KLM Air- lines were lifted S11% to S152%, while International Business Machines were up 57% to $3261/2. Corning Glass advanced $7 to $302, Xerox improved $SS to $182% and Texas Gulf Sulphur rose 53Y to 584Y.. Polaroid strengthened S8y to Sl44s-heavy camera demand had forced it to allocate output to dealers for the rest of the year. Polaroid also had no knowledge of rumours that a secondary offering NEW YORK, Sept 26. of 800,000 siaris would bp made. Kennecott Copper gained S1% to $33% while Kaiser Aluminum lost SI M to $34.%-Kennecott plans to sell Im. shares, or about one-half of its holdings of Kaiser. valued at over S36m. General Electric were down 52% to $86 % on concern about possible strikes when current contracts end this week. Televisions finished higher on continued reports of good colour set sales. Zenith Radio advanced 52% to 563-it hinted at a year end extra. dividend in view of expected record 1966 results. In mostly higher Rails. Chicago and North Western improved SS% to S89% without any special news. Teledyne gained S2% to $75% on termination of negotiations to acquire National Rolling Mills (which lost $1SI to $9% on the American S.EJ). Du Pont lost another $2% to $166%, attributed to cuts for a number of Dacron polyester pro- duct prices. Avco dipped % to $21% despite record third quarter and nine months results. Canada Firmer Canadian Stock Markets were generally firmer, with Industrials, Base-metals, Western Oils, Utili- ties and Papers all showing small gains. International Minerals rose SI after predicting record sales and profit for the year to next June 30. Dupont of Canada improved $% to $39. Interprovincial Pipe Line put on S% to $76%-it intends issuing Convertible Debentures to finance its 1967 expansion pro- gramme, while Bell Telephone shed 5% to S47%'following plans to offer Common stock to its Canadian shareholders.",

I This heightened speculation that I the two leaders would .close their I talks by promising further co- c operation in space projects. But there are few signs that their dis- cussions to-day led to any other agreements. Mr. Johnson and the German Chancellor met alone for 1I hours, this morning before I joining their advisers and, of course, the trip to Cape Kennedy I should give them several extra ( hours of pefsonal discussion. 1 On several crucial issues the two \\ sides seemed to come little closer a together.

SOffset Costs r Mr. Robert McNamara, the U.S. e Defence Secretary, is adamantly f opposed to any relaxation of. the V present arrangements, although a other Government, Departments have teen considering a method by 3 which West Germans would make r some purchases of equipment- a such as space materials-which t ordinarily it would not buy from V America. WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. It seems that this morning German officials made it clear that by pext June 30 it was unlikely that German purchases would exceed 51,000m., leaving' -some S350m. unaccounted for. In. addition, Americans were told that in any future arrange- ments the Germans did not believe they would be able to cover more than 50 per cent. of offset costs through purchases of military \"hardware.\" - As for the proposed \"'tripartite\" talks on support costs, whereby the U.S., Britain and West Germany might jointly attempt to find a solution to the problem, of -paying for troops stationed in Germany, Bonn officials would seem to have argued that they could not make any commitment to such .an arrangement until they had comrn completed current bilateral' talks with Britain.

A survey taken in mid-year shows that US. companies expect c to invest a record S9,200m. in new i plant and equipment overseas-a 1 21 per cent. increase on last year's c record figure of 57,600m. z In past years increases in capital I spending abroad by U.S. corpora- I tions have had damaging effects on the American balance of payments f position. This year, however, officials are confident investments will increase without this harmful effect: compared with last year's direct outflow of $3.300m., the out- flow for the first half of 1966 was at an annual rate of S2,700m. In addition, tight money con- ditions current in the U.S., with intense domestic demand for bank loans, prompted many American companies to borrow money abroad. For instance, capital out- I lays by U.S. companies with manu- facturing interests went up by I $550m. in 1965, yet capital outflows for these investments rose by only SSfOOm. Much of the balance was WASHINGTON, SeLt. 26. its taken up by special affiliates set up ,ul to borrow abroad: in .1965 these r's affiliates borrowed S212m., of ut- which $146m. still had not been 'as used at the end of the year. m.

   "text_content" : "By Our New York Corespondeni AMERICAN airlines, with their aircraft fying again after the pro- tracted machmists' strike, are back in the midst of another and linger- ing controversy. The problem is one simply of moving passengers -congestion at major airports is bring increasingly serious opera- tional delays and now threatens to set a ceiling on the growth of airline traffic in the U.S. \"Every major airport in the U.S..\" E. Thomas Burnard, execu- tive vice-president of the Airport Operators' Council. declared re- cently. \"will run out of runway capacity in the foreseeable future unless they do something about it.\" The Council reckons that upwards of S2.000m. will have to be spent in the next four years to supply needed capacity and it looks to the Federal Government to pay a third of this sum. But Bills before Congress allow for an outlay of only $300m. over the period. Mounting congestion, of course, is most obviously attributable -to the sudden surge of airline traffic in the past few years... Total revenue passenger miles flown by scheduled U.S. airlines rose to almost 52,000m. last year, from 44,000m. in 1964 and less than 22.000m. in 1955. before the era of commercial jets. Aviation industry experts now estimate that the 1965 figure will double by 1970 and, although \"jumbo\" jets-like the Boeing 747 carrying over 400 passengers - should thereafter reduce the strains on runway capacity, they will create new ones in airport terminal buildings. At the same time, the 1970s will bring supersonic transports and the pros- pect of further headaches for noise abaters and air traffic controllers. But the airlines are only partly to blame for overcrowding. General aviation, too. is booming and about 16,000 small private air- craft will leave U.S. production lines this year, or a third more than in 1965. Already, about b 100,000 of these aircraft are being si flown in the U.S. and they account b for a steadily increasing proportion P of all traffic movements at domestic si airports. In New York -at I Kennedy International, LaGuardia b and Newark - they currently a account for nearly 30 per cent. of si all movements, against 10 per cent. C back in 1950. L All tvpe\" of aircraft, in fact, are c; competing for space at airports- particularly in such large cities as a New York, Chicago and Los v Angeles -,which were planned a before anyone could have foreseen tl the recent rapid growth in popu- b larity of air travel. One result has d been that airlines are being forced h to stretch out their flight schedules e and, ironically, one carrier now has c non-stop jets operating between a New York and Philadelphia which c are scheduled to take longer than a would the same flights 25 years t, ago by propeller aircraft Another n has been growing frustration a among passengers and pilots as a they wait in lengthening queues of aircraft waiting to take off or land. Cost of Delays ' According to FAA estimates, the t cost of delays at airports under its jurisdiction-and these do not c include hold-ups during flight- r came to S63.6m. in 1965. These r delays, moreover, stand to rise r with the volume of air traffic, and i; both airline and local and central ? Government experts are now v having to search for ways to secure e even temporary relief. t One seemingly simple solution ) would be to provide more air- e ports. except that it is not so i simple. Curbs, for instance. on a flights into Washington National a this year were expected to divert I traffic to Washington's other air- ii Sort. Dulles International which r as been operating well below n capacity since it opened in 1963; r but Dulles turned out to be too far from the city to attract much business. Similarly. the New York Port Authority bas long urged a fourth commercial airport for New York, only to meet opposition both from suburban communities asked to accommodate it and from the Metropolitan Airlines Committee, an association of nine U.S. atrlines with services from the city. The MAC fears that a fourth airport would add to the incon- veniences of passengers changing aircraft in New York; it also feels that a new' facility would have to be built too far from the city to draw many passengers. Instead, the MAC has urged fuller utilisation of existing airports with construction of special runways for general aviation. as well as development of new general aviation airports around the perimeter of New York to lure some of the private aircraft now using Kennedy. LaGuardia and Newark. It notes that such airports have helped to relieve con- gestion in Los Angeles (where the Van Nuys private aircraft facility is now the busiest airport in the U.S after O'Hare. Chicago), Minneapolis-St. Paul and Pitts- burgh. As yet, the Port Authority is not convinced of the need for these private aircraft facilities, though it recently opened a general aviation runway at Kennedy and is consider- ing others at LaGuardia and Newark. It also announced last week a S150m. programme for expanding the capacity at Kennedy by 25 per cent. over the next ten years. Whether even this will be enough, however, is Prother matter. Already. Kennedy often operates above capacity in peak hours and, after a major study a year ago. R. Dixon Speas Associates, a consult- ing firm. estimated that aircraft movements through New York's main airports would rise almost 50 per cent, over the ten years to 1975."

Already Pioneer Finance, a large Detroit- based finance company, has become all but smothered by its debts and is now seeking to sell out to as- other instalment credit concern. General Acceptance. Also in Detroit, the Public Bank secured emergency approval from the Federal 'Reserve Board at the end of last week to merge into the Bank of the Commonwealth in 1 order to escape from its financial troubles. In fact the difficulties of both these concerns can be traced back far beyond the start of 1966 credit restraints But numerous other lending institutions particularly the savings banks have complained loudly over recent months about strains they are feeling and sources familiar with Pioneer's problems indicate that they would have been resolved much more easily if the NEW YORK, Sept. 26. Money market had not been so I tight. In the Pioneer case, the company recently notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was in default on most of its S116m. in debts and over the week-end it reported that it was sending to itsÂ» shareholders the offer from General Acceptance to acquire the bulk of its assets and liabilities.

Rica. the chairman. who presided, said: It is with very deep regret that I must begin by referring to the death last April of Mr. Harley Drayton. Although this Company was small compared with many others of which he was Chairman. I know he always had a special regard for European & General. having played a big part irf steering it through the dark dividendless days of the Thirties and the last great war. The Company was incorporated in 1928 and Mr. Drayton joined the Board in 1931. He became Chairman in 1937 when the value of the investment portfolio was only about Â£100.000. He will :be deeply- missed by all of us who knew and loved him. My colleagues on the Board have paid me the honour of elect- ing me to succeed Mr. Drayton as Chairman and we have since appointed Mr. John Storar a Director. The Year's Results For the first time in our Com- pany's history, total gross income exieeded Â£200,000, an increase of Â£26.000 over the previous year. I cannot say that this satisfactory re- sult entirely reflects the aptitude of your Direcors, because about half this increase flowed from the ad- vance receipt of dividends paid earlier than usual to obtain the transitional benefits provided by the Finance Act of 1965. For once, therefore, we must be grate- ful to the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, but only temporarily. as the amounts applicable to these dividends will be lost to us in our current financial year. As the earnings on our Ordinary Capital, excluding the \" jam re- ceived today instead of tomorrow \" were 20%, per cent., your Board in the first instance decided to recommend an increased final divi- dend of 12 per cent. to make 17 per cent. for the year. This would also have been in line with the 1965 Finance Act, which required 1S per cent. as a maximum reten- tion by, \" Investment Trusts.\" How- ever, in view of thO Government's deoiiion to freeze prices and in- comes and our subsequent un- succes ul application to the Trea- sury for, special consideration. we had .noalte.rpative but to repeal the previous year's total payment of IS per cent. You will notice that our Revenue Account now shows \" Franked In- vestment Income e\" as a separate itemt. .The amount shown under this heading. is- important to us because the new tax provisions allow us to offset the income tax deducted therefrom. against the in- come tas deductible on dividends aid by us. The Outlook With regard to the current year, it would be foolish to make any prediction reflecting any degree of optimism. For many years we were faced with all the irritations apper- taining to.\" stop-go,\" and were then. repeatedly told by those that now govern us that our economy would be freed from this kind of policy once and for all. As things have turned out, we still seem to be con- tending with \"stop-go\" to which something like \"do-don't\" has recently been added. This state of affairs inevitably affects the run- ning of an Investment Trust, with investment decisions being neces- sari ~ l inuiu ly . sariv influcned by tax eis tuuu of the most complicated nature. restrictions on overseas investment. controlled dividend policies, Selec- tive Employment Tax, and finally Capital Gains Tax. which must slow down to some extent our rate of growth. Irrespective of any criticisms we may like to make of Government policies over the last two years or so, I think that the Government's present efforts to improve the country's economic situation should receive the support of finance and industry, because time is un- Continued In next column",

The Annual General Meeting of AUTOSTRADE S.p.A. was held in Rome on April 27 1966 aind 'the followlag a'reextrac6s from the' Report.

For 1966 it was estimated that the total might reach Lit. 160,000 m. The element of State assistance for the whole road system in 1965 was as follows: Lit. 95,000 m. for State roads; Lit. 17,000 m. for motorway connections and Lit. 50,000 m. for ordinary roads.

The Company was satisfied It had done everything in its power to mitigate the effects on the motor. way of exceptional weather condi. tions. It had not however the powers to avert the risk of repeti. tion, and had accordingly urged the Ministry of Public Works to undertake suitable studies.

The total distribution for the year was 17Y.%. . Eiselm DIhiesto In spite of being, able to main- tanl our sales the results of this division have been disappointing owing to not being able to increase exports to the level anticipated and the restrictions at home. The sales to the South African market were reduced owing to credit restrictions and other difficul- ties in South Africa, but our ex- ports to other countries have. with one exception, increased during the past year. They were, at the same level (appaox. 37%% of the total sales) as those of the previous year despite the reduction in the South Africad trade. Sales for the first four months of this year show a reduction over the corresponding period of last year and every effort is being made to develop exports. Concrete & Quarrylag Division The profits of this division have again shown an increase due to the higher turnover during the yar. Further improvements have been made in our sales organisa- don which resulted in our pro- ducts being known and used in every area in- the country. The extra production necessary to sup- port these sales has been achieved by continued modernisation of our plant and improved manufacturing techniques. Our production unit is now one of the most modern and efficient in the country, enabling us to meet any competition and to take immediate advantage of any increased activity in the building and construction industriencs. Sales for the first (our months of the present year show a substantial in- crease over the same period of last year.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent MADRID, Sept. 26. The wave of rumours has now reached a pitch here that almost everybody seems convinced that a reform of Spaina' Constitution will be proclaimed after the Cabinet meeting which is expected to be held either on Wednesday or Friday this week. In any case, the Constitutional reforms will certainly be announced within the next three weeks. The public is getting impatient to know what \" 1966, a year of political and economic decision \" has in store for them. ------- . decision\" has in store for them. The Spanish Press, following the recent relaxation of 40 years of censorship, is insisting that \"the nation has the right to be in- formed,\" and is saying that \" secrecy at this stage of develop- tment is a serious mistake.\" The Intriguing question is not only when but how the Constitution will be reformed. As to when, there is General Franco's New Year message announcing \" important measures\" this year, and Information Minister Sr. Fraga Iribarne's hint dropped early in June that a referendum, would pro- bably be held within the next 12 months. New Winds This indicates that even if the offi- cial announcement is made now. the referendum on the constitutional re- form will have to come much later. As for the reform itself. Franco has stated that the measures to be taken will combine \"the spirit of our tradi- tions with modern developments\" Franco is a realist and knows that new winds are blowing across Castile But he does not want these winds to undo the social and economic achieve- ments reached after many years of up-hill struggle. The Government's traditional pillars - -the Army, the Church and the National Movement, with its econo- Smic and social counterpart, the Syndi. cates-are not as solid as they once t were. - The Army seems as depend- able as ever. But the Church has developed a strong liberal wing, and , the National Movement-the sole re- cognised political party-is splintered into a variety of Conservative. Chris- tian-Democrat, Neo-Fascist. Monarch. \" ist and left-wing cliques. Many of these groups have Minis- ters of their particular political shade 6 in the Cabinet, bit almost all are 2 clamouring for a bigger participation in public affairs. Franco's main pro. blem is how to give this multitude of factions a political voice without sacrificing national unity. i Franco's military background t makes him a meticulous character and e- he will do his best to leave the house r. in good order before he leaves. He is is now both Head of State and Chief n of Government, and, to begin with. i- he will turn one of these functions ' over to a person hand-picked by him it but approved by public vote.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent From Our Owm SHORT TIME and threatened dis- missals have become more frequent in West Germany this year, although the' instances remain isolated and strain is only gradu- ally relaxing on the labour market. The two recent cases to, attract attention are announcements from Bochumer Verein, the Krupp- controlled steel works, and from AEG, the electrical engineering concern. Bochumer Verein, with about 16.000 workers on the books,.will place half of. them on short time for four weeks. and will prematurely pension off some others. The reason is a double one: rationalisation resulting from a mer- .ger of the company with the other Krupp steel interests, and a recession in the steel industry. AEG expects to have to dismiss up to one in five of the 2,500 employees in its turbine factory in Berlin, unless new orders flow more quickly. That is a clear result for the poor demand for heavy engineering products. At mid-Au ust the Federal Labour Exchange , had 4,800 short-time BONN, Sept. 26. - workers on its books, meaning men t or women whose working week was at least one-sixth shorter than the normal basic working week in their plant. That is an infinitesimal pro- portion of the working population. The textile industry accounted for t more than half of them.

   "text_content" : "By a Special Correspondent, recently in Geneva TRB TWICE-YEARLY Board meeting of the United Nations Conf1ere5 o Trade and Develop- ment (UNCTUAD) has just finished in Geneva. N one can pretend that . pach sqlid business was achieved. Those who regard this forum for the economic problems of the developing countries (\"the South \") as little more than a talk- Ing shop were not disproved by this fourth Board session. The 55 nations represented found it difficult to decide even on the date and site of the next full-dress UNCTAD Conference, although it was finally recommended that it should be held in New Delhi next autumn. Selected Issues Dr. Raul Prebisch. the energetic Argentinian Secretary-General, had to spend a great deal of his time mediating between the delegations from the South, who mostly insist on using UNCTAD as a pulpit for the delivery of Harlem-style ser- mons on the sins of the developed countries, and those from the developed \" North.\" The latter feel that it would be more constructive to get down to business on one or two selected issues. There is a widespread view, how- ever, within the UNCTAD Secre- tariat and among the more experi- enced spokesmen of the South, that some progress in bridging the North-South development gap is possible before and during the second UNCTAD Conference a year from now. In this view there are three hopeful areas of advance. The first concerns the general, non-reciprocal but non-discrimina- tory tariff preferences on manufac- tures which the South would like the North to extend to it. In the two years that have elapsed since this proposal was first made, the South's motivation has altered. Preferences were originally urged as a means of allowing the South to augment its export earnings. Nowadays the South recognises that tariff changes alone are un- likely, to make substantial improve- ments tin its products' competitive. ness in Northern markets. But it still pushes its preference scheme because it sees in it an important incentive for the manufacturers of the North to invest in joint pro. cessing or manufacturing opera- tions in the low-wage South, for the production of goods for the Northern Industrialists' markets. The South also views its scheme as an insurance against the splitting up of the world into vertical trad. ing compartments: the Latin Americans are already pressing the U.S. to give preferential entry of their manufactures as compensa. tion for their fading prospects in the European market, where the Latins' African competitors are consolidating their preferential position. Only global preferences by all the North in favour of the whole South can, in this view, save the world from economic division. Many Difficulties The preference scheme has many difficulties and ambiguities, how- ever, and has until now met with total opposition from Washington. The Americans have relented, how- ever. to the extent of participating in an OECD working group on this question, and when this group reports in a few weeks' time, UNCTAD officials hope it will favour in principle the idea of tariff-free quotas. It might then be possible to negotiate these once the pressure of the Kennedy Round negotiations is lifted next spring. Whether UNCTAD or GATT is the proper forum for such negotia- tions is a question which will prob- ably excite another North-South altercation. The second priority concerns commodities, in which more coun- tries in the South ha'e a stake than in manufactures. (A report by Dr. Prebisch to the- recent Board meeting showed that Hlong Kong accounts for no less thean a quarter of the South's exports of manufactured goods to the North. and that India and Isbfil icd'.nt for another quarter.) The fe#ing in Geneva is that a softening of the American stand on the mini- mum cocoa price might be in the offing,. and this might make an Dr. Prebisch International Cocoa Agreement a g political possibility over the i coming year. The next UNCTAD Conference might also agree on the general I principles of buffer stock opera- f tions and pre-financing, which : provided one of the obstacles to the recent cocoa negotiations. This I would clear the path for further commodity agreements in the s future. Finally, UNCTAD hopes that it can soon register a success in the Sfield of development aid, the stag- nation of which was much s deplored in speeches at the Board h- meeting. The International Mono- e tary Fund's schemh for compen- I satory financing, which would it insure commodity producing coun- g tries against unexpected shortfalls a in their export earonugs, is now f on the verge of acceptance by both L North and South. it UNCTAD, which played an im- portant role in pushing this f scheme, regards it as absolutely i- crucial that the South finally e agreed, as part of its overall pro- n visions, to open up its development policies and practices to some de- gree of international inspection. UNCTAD officials stress that this, which may be the key break* through on which future co-opera- tion between North and South on development strategy may depend, is only possible within an organi- sation where the South feels itself fully represented and able to exert strong political pressure. Practical Role In this view UNCTAD has a practical role in the future which no other body can play neither GATT nor the World Bank nor the OECD. But the North views with alarm the prospect of submitting its economic position to the judg- ment of a politically-oriented UN body, and any move to put teeth into UNCTAD meets with opposi- a tion. le Already its efforts to get into the technical assistance field (in the e contexts of port improvement and al export promotion) are being re- a- sisted by the North. This continu- ;h ing debate over the fundamental to role of the new organisation i's weakens its impact. But the new er evidence of the growing gap be- he tween North and South makes it likely that the North will soon it move on preferences, on commodi- le ties or on development financing, g- to show that, whatever its criticism :h of UNCTAD, it is not entirely un- rd moved by the South's plight.",

Each area will have some specialities; Aberdeen, for example, offers Gaelic and golf as well as chemistry and physics, Wigan is strong on mining, Hereford on agricultural subjects. But every* where there is a common core of studies, mainly but by no means exclusively vocational: engineering, craft mercantile, secretarial, a domestic trades; professional occupations from accountancy and architec- ture to works management and writing; and alongside these and more academic subjects a steadily growing list of recrea- tional activities, especially in the fields of art, drama, music dancing, and athletic sports and games. Predictably. much the greatest volume and variety of courses is found in the London area. where this week between a quarter and half a million students are expected to enrol in evening classes provided by the Inner London Education Authority, whose gaily acketed guide, loodligh* lists the courses offered under nearly 700 main headings. It has been claimed for London that if a sufficient num- ber of people (ordinarily ten to a dozen) request a course in any worth while study or activity the local education authority will provide a tutor, accommo- 0 County Hall, S.F.l; 6d. datlon ad the necessary equip ment-bold claim, but not un- justified. I remember vividly, for example, mkingtl' my way throunh the blackout dunring the 193925 war to a church in South London where a group ..of ardent campanoltotgi regu- larly practised their craft, ringing their bells between the air raids. Campanology does not, I note with regret. figure in the 1966-67 Plloodlght (though I have no doubt that a course, or courses, would be arranged if requested). but many other equally esoteric pursuits are in- cluded, ranging from the utili- tarianism of Automation for Batch Production \" and \" Yacht master (Coastal) Certificate \" to the relative frivolity of \" Go- Kart Making\" and \" Korfball.\" Admittedly, you may have to travel a bit to attend such courses, for each is provided by a single college only-though again, were there sufiicient de- nand without doubt classes would be laid on elsewhere. All Levels Classes in what may be called standard subjects are available in abundance. And, as through- out Great Britain, instruction can be obtained at any level of attainment from that of the 15- year-old school leaver to that of the top-ranking business executive or the post-graduate research student. Some 30 or more colleges will help you to secure a' GCE, if that be your ambition, and double that number will aid you towards a National or City and Guilds Certificate. More than a dozen will prepare you for London University or CNAA (Council for National Academi'c Awards) degrees. Among them is that unique institution Birk- beck College, the only univer- sity college in the country catering primarily for part-time students-who must, inciden- tally, be in full-time emtloy- ment during the day. Twenty-eight languages (not counting. Esp ranto) can be studied int London's evening classes. All except Anglo-Saxon and Latin are in use to-day. Courses in clastical Greek and Hebrew are available, but far more numerous are courses in the modern forms of these languages. Most of the languages offered are European, but the list includes Afrikaans, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Swahili and Yoruba. It is encouraging to note, especially in view of current criticisms of Britain's handling of immi- grants, that among numerous courses in English for students from abroad are courses re- served for Pakistanis or for Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish. Courses in science, pure and applied, and in all the main branches of engineering are available throughout London, as indeed they are in every large town in Britain. Increasing attention is being paid to the newest technologies, especially the theory and operation of computers. Management studies also grow in number and range. covering costing, marketing, personnel control, purchasing, works layout, estimating and production control. Finance as such seems in little demand, though economics is highly popular, and there is the usual small group of courses about the Stock Exchange, for em. ployees, laymen and small investors. Team Games Perhaps the greatest increase in recent years has been in pro- vision for outdoor pursuits. To-day there are not only numerous courses of instruction in all the main team games, in angling, camping and canoeing, and in gardening-the perennial favourite-but also courses in coaching for most of the games. Indoor games, save for such exceptions as chess and table tennis. do not bulk nearly so largely, but handicrafts and hobbies do; and they attract very large numbers of students. This is symptomatic of a general trend in English further education. Since the war this has been to move vocational courses, especially more exact- ing ones. from the evening to the working day, there to be studied in full-time, safidwich, or day-release courses, and to free leisure hours for leisure pursuits. The trend has still a long way to go. and will prob- ably never reach its logical end. Personal ambition will continue to devote evenings to advance- ment rather than entertainment",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent KUALA LUMPUR. Sept. 26. The Malaysian Government has high hopes that ts trade mission now in Moscow will result in increased trade with Russia, and possibly to the setting up of trade offlces in the two capitals. At present Malaysia has no direct diplomatic links with Russia, though there have been exploratory contacts between the 'embanuias ns the twurn enuntries in Banakok. embassies of the two countries Malaysia already has a highly favourable trade balance with Russia. Exports to the Soviet Union totalled nearly Â£40m. last year, chiefly accounted for by Russian purchases of rubber and tin. Imports, mainly woven cotton and sugar, amounted to only Â£2.5m. The mission to Moscow will try to extend Malaysian exports to items ranging from iron-ore to canned pineapple. In return, it is expected to investigate the possi- bility of more imports from Russia, such as electrical equip- ment and farm machinery. There is speculation here that the mission may lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations, although there is no Cabinet Minister or senior diplomat among its mem- bers. It is led by the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Com- merce and Industry, but is other- wise comprised of leading business- men and manufacturers. It is felt here that the fact that Russia was willing to receive the mission is an indication that Moscow may be ready to propose a formal exchange of envoys. This is reinforced by the fact that in recent months the Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, though stoutly deter- mined to maintain Commonwealth links, has stated more than once that Malaysia's foreign policy should be more flexible and prag- matic, especially where its eco- nomic interests are concerned. This is in line with the Malaysian Government's decision last month to end Commonwealth preferential tariffs on a wide range of imports. Frustration Secondly, Russia's apparent willing- ness to establish closer links with Malaysia may also in part stem from its frustratin experience with Indo- nesia, to which it ave huge credits in recent years without ga ina any tangible economic or political advantage. Thus Malaysia stands to gain in three ways from its staunch resistance to Indonesian aggression: It has been relieved to a considerable extent of the financial burden imposed by confrontation; its valuable former trade with Indonesia is in the process of being resumed; and it now has the prospect of increased trade with Russia and possibly Eastern Europe.",

At the sam ajor-General Talaat Hoaasn,'Commander of the Eyptian forcs iYeme declared in the southern town of Tai that Egyptian forces would stay in Yemen \"as long as the Yemeni revolution is threatened by con- spiracies.\" Finally, the UAR Vice-President. Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer, in a speech to naval officers at Alexan- dria yesterday declared that Egyp- tian forces were prepared to stay 20 years if need be, and noted that Cairo was able to shoulder the expenses of the Yemen expedition, revealing that this was costing Â£E2.5m. annually. (This sum, just over Â£2m., would be enough to pay each Egyptian soldier in Yemen Â£40 a year.) But despite the tough speeches, the Yemeni Republic had little to celebrate yesterday, on its fourth birthday. The Republican r6gime to-day is an empty shell with only one man to represent it-President- Premier Abdullah Sallal, also Com- mander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Sallal's r6gime derives its powers and legality not from Yemeni executive and legislative institutions-which are non-existent -but from the United Arab Re public' and 50.000 Egyptian troops now concentrated in the triangle of Sanaa (the capital), Taiz (the twin capital in the South), and the port of Hodeida on the Red Sea. The outlying Yemeni areas are under control of hostile tribesmen who follow the dethroned Imam, Mohammed Al Badr, and the princes of his Hamiduddin dynasty. In successive crises since Septem- ber 26th, 1962, when Sallal led the \" revolution \" which overthrew the Imam, the Republic has been purged of practically all its leaders. Sallal, with Cairo's help, has now removed the last batch of these leaders when he appointed himself Premier of a new pro-Cairo a. h 1 Â»r st to in te L1 i - Ps to e* in- a P- ry at ie C. 18 st to in to it- a- re n- ro By Our Middle Ea it Cabinet after deposing the Cabinet r a of LIGt.e*ne Hassan Al Amri a (1, and d isbandin the Republican k e Council- which ncludeid the Repub- p h lie's most respected civilian per- I or sonalitist-Ahmed Nomah and t i- Abdel Rahman Al Iryani. a it I t Massive purge Â·. Sallal last week also executed a massive purge of Government ad I . ministration. He dismissed Yemen's t e1 pennent representative to the SU.N., the'President of the Recon- I d strction and Develobpment Bank, it which is Yemen's only bank, and i the Governor of the southern dist- Srict of Ibb. The U.N. delegate, n. Mohsen Alainit was: accused of Baathist leanins; the Bank Presi. i dent of spplying Amri with funds; a and Ibbs Governor of inciting_ n. tribesmen in his district against p. Sallal and the Egyptians. Sallal iy then appointed a new chief of at security and a new head of intelli President Abdullah Sallal rt Ie gence, and named new under- er secretaries for all Ministries. 1o It is also reliably reported that a n, secret purge was held among the ie 3.000 officers of the 16,000-man y. Republican army. This will aggra- n- vate the situation as the purged ie officers belong to influential tribes ie who have so far been loyal to :n Sanaa. In fact several tribal leaders s. around Sanaa were reported late w last week to have given Cairo a one- se month ultimatum to remove Sallal if and allow Amri to return. ro It is now obvious that the main r a P 1: t a I a c t I I I 1 reason Sallal hasu rtoed to Sanaa after a year in Egypt was to -re- habilitate Egypt's 6o04ti and prestge ingide thee WIfi.bc T.his position had bee. s\"wmogUy threatened by the leadifts bo-hAve now beep removed, and ever .sice his return Sallal has been toprina areas close to Sanaa, visiting army camps, and delivering speeches eulogising the UAR, President Nasser, and Egyptian assistance to the Yemeni revolutiop. This cam- paign has, of course, been widely publicised by the Egyptian infor- mation media. To help him carry out his mis- sion, Sallal has picked an army officer known for his staunch sup- port for Cairo. Colonel Abdul1i Al Guzeilan, chief of YemePi intelligence, was. promoted to Major General;, and appointed Vice-Premier and Deputy Comi. tnander-in-Chief of the-Armed Forces. He thus becomes Ilumnber Two in the r6gime, both at the Government and military-levels. ' Experience has proved.-however, that for a Yemeni to be pro-Cairo now is no guarantee that he will continue to feel the shme way. Ex-Premier Amri, as well as Iryani and Noman, had been known to be strong supporters of President Nasser. The reason for these men's disenchantment with Nasser has not been clearly explained yet; what is more, during previous crises between Sallal on the one side and Noman and Iryani on the other, Amri had always stood with Sallal. His defection to the Iryani-Noman camp has been one of the most important develop- ments of recent months. Personal .ambition But the question remains: why? Amri, Noman and lyrani are definitely Republicans. Noman, who headed the Republican side to the talks with the Royalists at the Harad conference last November, strongly refused the proposal that the word \"Republic\" be dropped in order to set up a Yemeni State of Republican and Yemeni factions as a means of settling the problem. The Haradh talks collapsed over this point. Noman and Iryani soon realised that the deadlock at Haradh spelt the end of their hope of a blood- less solution to the conflict, and !m 'a Le Â·U .b A `P oc tl tl S t 'I f f r 1 i a I c c a i I r c a t a a I a i i t t I favourable to Cairo, was reached for South' Arabia. This argument made sense to many Yemeni leaders, who saw their country being plunged deeper and deeper into the conflict between Nasser and Britain on the one hand and Nasser and King Feisal on the other. Cairo, however, turned a deaf car. With Sallal's return, the tensions in Yemen are bound to increase and a settlement will be even harder to reach. Sallal is deeply hated by the Royalists, and by the Saudis who support. them. (His removal to Cairo last year was one of the conditions by Saudi Arabia and the Royalists for the Haradh talks.) Sallal too is opposed to any negotians with the Royalists, and has made virulent attacks against Saudi Arabia and King Feisal. Nor can his Government end the dissension and discontent inside the Republican rzgime. But dissident Republicans are helpless in the face of 50.000 Egyptian Stroops, and as \"revolutionaries,\" Sthey cannot possibly turn to the SImam and Saudi Arabia without I renouncing what they stood for. the continance of the itian military presence, and domIation. They, were later johid by Amri, who was motivated more by per- Lohil ambition. He had been under the impression Sallal was to .be, kept in Cairo, and that he, Amri, would become the next President 'Amri then began to comiplain, sometimes publicly, that the Yemen was being sacrified for the sa-e of Egyptian ambitions in South Arabia. He charged that the Egyptians were freezing the Yemeni question until a settlement. t Â· r 3 t ii Y r r d a r s e a y a a c a h o I, :s 8 It ,t It M a I, a It"

The main theme , is to help schools develop links between teaching science and applying it in practical work, and over 50 are taking part., They have been grouped into five regions each of which will feed back information to Loughborough. At the end of the year. this centre will report to the Schools Council on the need for a major curricu- lum in that area.

As he says, good translation is the crux of the whole matter, but the fact is that less than 1 per cent. of the printers in this country would know bow to ensure good translation. The exporter has got to con- tact his own translators direct and he can choose the right bureau if at the outset he makes certain of three thinigs. One, that his translating bureau has all translation carried out in the foreign country concerned. Two, that it employs people that are specialists in his own company's field (telecommunications engi- neers. for example). Three, that he himself provides all necessary information--draw- ings, illustrations, etc.--4o make the text absolutely clear to the translator. Admittedly getting good trans- lation is a little more complex than that but nevertheless these points are fundamentals. One must also check translation in the initial stages-but this is easily done. As to the actual production of foreign language literature, it seems to me that a perfect knowledge of the foreign language is also necessary at many stages in production itself. What the exporter needs is a company which has its own international designers, handles typesetting in virtually every foreign language and prints both litho and letterpress and is able to have every phase of the entire job supervised by a per- son of the nationality concerned. As long as one asks people who do not know the language concerned to handle the work, mistakes and difficulties will continue to occur and our ex- port drive be a little less effec- tive as a result.

Research on these beams, pro- duced by lasers, is in progress at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. which is to be trans- ferred to Martlesham. Suffolk, in 1969-70 at a cost of about Â£6m. Post Office scientists do not accept claims which have been made in the U.S. that millions of telephone calls will ultimately he made along such light beams. They point out that the cost of the equipment to put in and take out the messages on those links in such numbers would be prohibitive. Instead, they believe that a far better and more practical system By Our Scientific Correspondent would be to use the so-called \"light pipes\" in which fine fila- ments of glass transmit beams of light without dificulty around sharp radius bends to carry more limited amounts of information. The messages are superimposed on the light beams in the sorn of a modulation which can be made at extremely high speed by applying an electric current to special types of crystals through which the beams are made to pass. Success with this concept is dependent on the discovery of new varieties of glass which attenuate light to a very small extent. Because of the demand for more and more message-carrying capacity, roesearch is concentrated also on very high frequency systems which would operate from the big transmisiaon towers going into use all over Britain. Ultimately, however, at the highest frequencies now being considered, transmission will have to go over to waveguide tube systems, since atmospheric conditions begin to play a considerable role. Another important area of research Is in the provision of better and faster svystems for the transmission of Information to and from computer centres. The highest speeds now available are on the Datel 600 links which provide 600 binary digits per second. It is expected that on rented lines speeds of 2.400 hinary digits a second will soon be availahle.

In a further reply, your Brussels correspondent doubted this and said not all countries were as advanced and tourist-minded as Switzerland. He is right and I am wrong.

SET benefits car factory employers but penalises garage and repair shop owners, even though one result of the reduction in car sales on the domestic market- brought about by indirect \" squeeze\" methods-must be to prolong the working life of cars and to require better servic- ing and repair facilities. The planners have failed to strike a balance between the propensity of the consumer to Invest money in cars and the need of the community to keep traffic moving. We have one of the highest car densities per head of population in Europe and also one of the most back- ward systems of motorways, underground and rapid transit railways and modern freight wagons in the world. In terms of main-line electrification-an important criterion of railway modernisation-we are only beginning to catch up with other industrialised nations. The opportunity of securing a pool of skilled manpower from the motor industry might have been used to strengthen the working force needed to remedy the omissions of the last 40 years in the field of public trans- port. This would mean re- dundancy to some purpose-not the \"shaking out \" of labour in the vague hope that something else may turn up somewhere. In terms of economic resources, we must have a viable public trans- port network before we can afford\" an even greater car density. Much has been said about the importance of car exports and the importance of a thriving home market to support them. However, it may well be that a more difficult home market might encourage the car industry to do even better on foreign markets-partly by encouraging a less complacent and \"war- ranty \"-bound attitude to custo- mers. On the other hand, the recent British contract for the electrifi- cation of part of the rail system of Pakistan is an encouraging sign that this important type of export has not been permanently lost to the country which in- vented railways.

A special committee to advise the Miasitr of1.Tcndaouiy on how this knowledge can be spread lha been formed. The Minister, Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Bena, yesterday described the development as the \" most dramatic single example since the Ministry was formed of how improved technology. could lead to large savings.\" The chairman of the new com- mittee is Mr. H. P. Jost, who headed the team which produced the first report on lubrication pub- lished earlier this year. He described this figure of sav- ings as \" on the low side\" and made it quite clear that just as in Britain, industrial designers over- seas had been overtaken by rapid advances in the size, power, weight and other characteristics of the equipment they were required to develop. - Because of that the science of lubri- cation--or tribology-had tended to be neglected since it was an inter- disciplinary activity demanding know- ledge of metallurgy, chemistry and physics in advanced areas where the average .echanical engineer had little opportunity to work. Mr. Jost sid that in the overall savings to be made the largest share came under the heading of mainten- ance and replacement costs, which were put at Â£230m. a year. In establishing that figure, many cases in the steel,' aircraft, power generation and other industries had been considered and it had been derived from concrete examples of failure due to bad bearing or lubri- cation system design. In each. instance, a very conservative sum had been aliowed. . The next move will be for the Ministry to spread the, available in- formation. When that has been done. the provision of new data will be considered. Meanwhile, new training facilities at under.praduate #ad post- graduate levels are being planned."

The theme of the conference will be the human problems of indus- trial development and re-develop- ment in Commonwealth countries. It will follow the pattern of the two previous meetings held at Oxford m 1956 and in Canada in 1962. About 300 members from Com- monwealth countries, chosen from a cross-section of managerial, technical, supervisory, and operative or trade union roles in industry will attend. The U.K. has been asked to send 40 men and women. The present pattern of conferences at six-yearly intervals is thought to have merit, but some Commonwealth countries may find it difficult to stage meetings of the size of the first three. and in future may welcome the oppor- tunity of sponsoring smaller ones. It has also been suggested that regional meetings or seminars along the same lines could be held.",

He stressed that tthe main object was to draw in the medium and small companies since those held the salvation oil the British economy in their hands. \"Automating a few giants is not. goring to help.'\" he asserted. and added that there was no other way for the smaller organisation to compete in a world of mass- production. It is expected that over the first three or four years between 40 and 50 schemes will be started up involving an expenditure by the Corporation of about Â£2.5m. How- ever. this is only a rough estimate and. if the new \" no-risk\" scheme appeals to industry. far more money may be involved. Mr. J. C. Duckworth, 'managing director of the Corporation, said yesterday that his organisation would no doubt take an early* application for fresh support as a healthy sign that industry was really interested in the scheme. Industry can apply either to the Corporation or to the company. Projects will be submitted in the form of proposals showing how the esti mated costs are to be shared between the Corporation, the company and the customer. The commercial justification for the\"\" project will include an assessment of potential benefits to the user, the estimated potential market for cortn parable applications and the estimate of the company's share of this markL. This means that no one-off project* will be entertained. A work programme with target dates will be laid down and the Cor- poration will have to be assured that, no alternative funds are readily avail* able to the user and that the user will buy the \" sale or return\" equip. ment if it effectively does improve his productivity as it is intended to do. With the reduction in support for advanced research and development from military projects which will take place over the next few years, this new form of agreement may prove to be the prototype for Government technological support to industry.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Scientific Editor A Wolverhamptron company demonstrated yesterday an original system of recording vision (or video) signals on disc. The picture shown was that of a local cabaret artist, who could be seen on a television screen and heard at the same time. Mr. C. J. Mason is the inventor, and a director of the company. Video Records. It was registered in January with a capital of Â£10.000 to develop the invention. Basis of the recording system is a variable-density signal on the photo-sensitive narrow spaces be- tween the groowvs of a transparent disc. To accongmodate the wide range of frequencies needed the signal is scrambled to fill the whole available area. Sales Potential As conceived at present the video signal is on the outer periphery of a 10-inch disc. so that a 7-inch sound disc can be placed on top. both discs on the one spindle, and synchronised so that sound and vision are in agreement. Mr. Mason points out that over 90 per cent. of record sales are in the 7-inch popular discs lasting a few minutes. The first application is thus for people to be able to see their performers as well as hear them. There is also advertising potential for window displays on a continuous- repeat system. The synchronising can be done mechanically or electronically and both systems are ready for production design. The recording equipment costs about the same as that for audio recording. The video record player would cost from Â£45 to Â£50 in the U.K. but the video discs would cost as little as 2s."

Lord Erroll of Hale. president of the London Chamber of Com- merce. will take the chair. Though details of this event have not been publicised beyond the membership of the London Chamber of Commerce, applica- tions for tickets are already well in excess of the number that can be accommodated. The same. or similar programmes may however be offered later to regional chambers of commerce. It is interesting to note that without the magic word \"exports\" in the title of the programme, demand for tickets would have been less. The link between the industrial film and exports is still far from obvious in the average businessman's mind."

The agreement was virtually concluded before the freeze took effect and is the last of a series arranged by the company, which ls part of the International Publishbing Corporation, with different unions. It gives a small increase in wages In return for the elimination of arious restrictive practices. Some 90 maintenance men at five. of the company's London works have threatened to go on strike from to-morrow if the agree. ment does not go through. This evening at a mass meetinS at the Southwark works, repre. sentatives of the Electrical Trades Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union will appeal to the men not to strike.

   "text_content" : "From, Our Own Correspondent RALEIGH idustriet lhp decided to do something about about the old complaint that miiny iBritish companies try to export the left- overs which the. home market won't take.' The company has $roight out a line of Raleigh Mndf`SA Ticycles designed peciically for tie Ger- man market hA.,as been a thoroughgoin operation, goinig far beyond upecialstyling changes. What is on show now at the Cologne Cycle Fair is a German bicycle with an Englist \"accent.\" The entire frame had to be re- designed to get away from the \" sit up and beg \" position of an English bike. The \"geometry\" of the new model is therefore German. The finish remains English. Mudguards, for instance, are of steel or plastic in a colour matching the frame rather than of the contrasting metal i alloy usual in Germany. That gives. the machine a more solemn look BONN, Sept. 26. rather like a man in a lounge suit instead of flannel bags. The Germanised models may also open the way into other mar- kets for Raleigh. Austrian and Swiss tastes are much in line with that prevailing in Germany, Since those countries are in EFPA they would be supplied directly from Nottingham, whereas Germany gets its Raleighs via the Nether. lands, where they are assembled by a local company, ERI. German sales and a supply of spares will be handled bkya com- pany at Opladen founded by ERI. Mr. Brian Powdrill, Raleigh's European exports manager, has been seconded to Opladen. His aim is to sell. 10,000 of the new bicycles in the next 12 months and to increase sales to 30,000 a year within three years. Besides this he hopes t be selling 10,000 of the small-whoeled. Ralegh models by then. They will retain their English look. The Switchcuar division of Amociated Electrical Industries bas received an order worth Â£150,000 from the State Electricity Conmmision of Victoria for rix 220,000-volt, 15,000-MVA oil crcultbreakenr to be installed at Hazelwood Power Station.

   "text_content" : "ONE OF THE PROBLEMS be- coming apparent in the world to- day was the widening gap between demand for new capital and available supply, said Sir Maurice Parsons. deputy governor of the Bank of England. at a Mansion House dinner last night to mark the 21st anniversary of the Indus- trial and Commercial Finance Cor- poration. The problem derived to a con- siderable extent from the balance of payments difficulties of the U.S. which, as a consequence, was be- ing forced to reduce the level of new investment abroad, he said. \" Their recent restraints are making an impact on capital markets everywhere.\" The situation was not made easier by the fact that there were relatively few of the major indus. trial countries which had efficient and sophisticated capital markets and that the two major markets- London and New York-\" are both seriously inhibited by a balance of payments problem.\" They were un- likely to see in the period ahead a resumption of an outflow of U.S. capital of anything approaching the magnitude to which they had grown accustomed over the last 20 years. Mergers Argument \" If this is correct. It is again the small concern which will suffer most and this is an added argument for mergers which would give the potential borrowers better prospects of acquiring new capital either In this country or abroad.\" All this ponted 1 the conclusion that the IC rC was I kely to be raced __ with more demands than ever- assuming. that is. that they were not about to enter a serious recession. \"This is an assumption which I hope can reasonably be made but which could be falsified if the Govern- ments of the major industrial coun- tries are unable to show a certain degree of foresight. \"For example. when the subject of international liquidity was being dis- cussed in the Group of Ten. it was generally agreed that this should be done on a contingency basis in order that prompt action could be taken should the contingency arise of an undue shortage of international iqn a clear reference to the French. Sir Maurice went on: \"One GovernÃ½ ment. however, now appears to be arguing that planning for this pur- pose should not commence until the contingency has actually arisen. This is an argument which one can only describe as nonsensical because if we wait till then, and knowing how there will always he highly debatable ques- tions to be settled of how to handle new techniques. the situation could easily have got out of hand while discussions were proceeding as to how to deal with it.\" Larger Units Replying to Sir Mautice Parsons, Lord Sherfield, chairman of ICFC. who was host at the dinner, said: \"We in ICFC have always been alert to the possibilities for encouraging the formation of larger units in appro- priate conditions in the case of firms In which we have an interest. We have always proceded on the basis that the partners should be willing partners, and we have also adopted the criterion that the success of a er penI in the end on the rualrty of the management available In the larger unit, But we are at this very moment considerin If any. further steps we shold tke to enable us to act more etfectively",

   "text_content" : "BY CNiB'QthX TETHER BY THE RECASTING of American Government borrowing procedres earlier this month seems to 'ave brought the world Interest rates war to a higher pitch of intensity than ever. But tCai is by accident tather than design. And, in point of fact, the new!American think- ing .on loneotary policy that pro- moted It providga solid grounds for thinking, especially when viewed in conj nction with a number of other recent develop- ments having a dose bearinpg on the etent and form of inter- national competiton for hot 'money supplies, that an armistice may .t last be on the way. Since it has been generally taken for granted that the Johnson Administration's decision to reduce the weight of official borrowing in the long-term capital market will lead to the U.S. Government raising a lot more Treasury bill money, short-term money rates in New York have recorded a sharp advance since the beginning of this month-the three months Treasury bill rate is, for instance, nearly %Y per cent. higher now thaq it was at the close of August.; And, since the most important. of the inter- national hot money markets-that concerned with Euro-dollar activity-necessarfly takes its cue to a significant ;extent from the behaviour of American short-term rates, the inevitable result has been to give additional impetus to the upward movement in rates that has been in prdgress there since the beginning of the year. Feverish Order Money borrowed on 7-days' notice now commands a rate there of around 6% per cent., compared with 6% per cedt. in the middle of last month, 5% per cent. at the end'of June and a bare 5 per cent. at the beginning of the year. The three months rate, which started the year in the region of 5% per cent., is currently not far short of the. 7 per cent. level. Never before since this market made its appearance on the inter- national financial scene in the second half of the 1950s has the battle for funds within it been of the feverish order these terms indicate. However. unlike the advance that took placefearlier in thi year, the latest advance in New York rates was in no sense prompted by the desire of me U.S. authorities to strengthen the American front in the internationial hot money war. It is obviously no more than an unintended by-product of Washing- ton's decision to try to put a stop to the dearer money movement within the country for -domestic olicy reasons. And. since this I basic shange in the direction of American monetary policy could learly have a most important bearing o t outlotk for U.S. iterest rateg l the broade sesee,- I its longer-term implications for the hot money war could be of much greater significance than its initial consequences. The U.S. can certainly claim with every justification that it was in no sense responsible for precipi- tating the international Interest rates wvar. But. as I pointed out shortly before the recent overhaul of American monetary policy was announced. it can be said to have switched from the defensive to the offensive in recent months and. in the process, added some potent fuel to the flames. Thus it was the upward movement in U.S. rates provoked by the Federal Reserve Board's tighter money measures that was to a large extent to blame for the serious weakening of the pound's pll on interest arbitrage account in'the summer. The same factor played a major part in precipitatiag the series of Bank Rate increases announced by Continental countries a few months back. If. therefore, the American policy overhaul can be interpreted to mean that the U.S. can be counted upon to cease making the running in the international hot money war once the initial reper- cussions of the policy change have been digested, it is a most en- couraging development. And it would indeed seem evident that the Administration has been persuaded that it would be worth going to a great deal of trouble to halt the dearer money trend- presumably meaning, among other things, that the Federal Reserve Board will not, amain be permitted to take the initiative in pushing the country further down this road in the wav that it did late last year in defiance of the President's wishes. German Attitude This, moreover, is not the only reason for thinking that a halt may at last be in sight to the growth of international competition in the interest rates field. There are indi- cations that some of the countries whose monetary policies have directly or indirectly contributed greatly to the build-up of tensions in hot money markets are begin. ning to see less need to push dear money for domestic reasons. The German authorities, for example, are evidently satisfied that their attempt to combat infta-f tionary stresses with the help of * tight credit and other restraints ow-s' economic activity are now bearinfif,; fruit on a sufficient scale to suggest, that some relaxation on the mone. tary policy front will be feasible in the not-far-distant future. And,`. with the D-mark regarded as ji5t5 about the world's safest currencv. . the upward movement in Germac rates has played a part probably second in importance only to that of the U.S. in promoting tbhe interest rates war. Naturally such changes of heartl on domestic account should greatly help to keep the inter* national financial temperature from rising further. And an even more important reason for think* ing that an armistice is on the way: here is to be found in the new,. elaboration of the swap credits'. system that the major countries have arranged to guard against a possible deterioration in the inter- national payments situation. The new network can be said to be aimed more at seeing that hot money flows produced by. interest rates competition can bo coped with than 'at preventing such flows taking place. But the very fact that tensions generated .by changes in interest arbitrage relationships have been mentioned as partly responsible for their\" creation does demonstrate that theY leading countries have at. last awakened to the danger an uncon- trolled interest rates war poses, to the world's financial health. : Price to be Paid: Whether or not, therefore, thei. completion of the new swap arrangements has been acQomn' panied by a secret understanding between the countries concerned not to go on hoisting rates against. one another, it seems highly prob- able that it will have, the effect of discouraging Bhank Rate changes and other monetary policy moves calculated to aggravate the exist-: ing situation in the international hot money markets. To say that there is at last a solid prospect of a world-wide' dearer money trend being arrested is not, of course, to say that there is a prospect of rates returning to' more normal levels in the early future. This part of the process is going to take a long time. And that will just have to be regarded as the price that has to be paid for the failure of the international financial collaboration system to recognise the dangers implicit in a world interest rates war until the situation had taken on an ex- tremely ugly look.",

   "text_content" : "THE' TRANSPORT and 0enitA Workers' Union hat been quiCl to declare official the strike -aled by employees of the XLonghidge Gopup of Delivery Agentis The strike is a protest againdt the employers' decision to dismiss boiMe 360 men, half of the combiand labour force, rather than arrange for the men to work alternate weeks. Given, the extent to which British Motor js already stocked up, this ation will probably bring out- put at Longbridge to a complete stop fairly soon. Other sections of the company, together with the outside firms that supply it with components, cannot remain unaffected for long. Trouble is spreading in the motor industry even more quickly than had been expected. Some Questions A good many questions about the position of the delivery drivers have yet to be answered. It seems odd, for example, that so high a proportion of the labour force is to be dismissed. British Motor's agents may well be so overstocked that they are unlikely to want many new de. liveries in the immediate future, but some of the men who are being dismissed will almost cer- tainly have to be re-engaged before long. Again, the em- ployers have yet to spell out why the upion's work-sharing pro- posal as \" impracticable and un- economic.\" It is, apparently, no more than a variation on the standard practice of short-time working designed to economise the cost to the employer of National Insurance and Selective Employment Tax on men whom he *can only afford to employ half-time. Nor is it yet clear how thoroughly the employers discussed the situation with the union and what average period of notice has been given to the men dismissed. What is clear, unfortunately, is, that the strike suits the interests of everyone, except those'who will be put out of work as an indirect consequence of it. The Delivery Agents are evidently so short of orders that they can bear a strike very well. British Motor itself-which an- nounced yesterday evening that it expected its own redundancies to be about 12.000, rather more than most people expected-has no reason to be particularly put .outby a development which has .th effect of cutting production drastically but is not apparently of . its own making. And the T.G.W.U., is placed very com- ;fortably indeed. It can fight for the principle of work-sharing on better ground than it could ever have done at British Motor itself, with a. much greater assur- ance of full support and at much lower cost to its funds, yet pro- duce exactly the same effect. The strike will inevitably be interpreted as a struggle on a point of principle between Mr. Cousins and Mr. Gunter. It is important, therefore, to be cer- tain that a real difference of principle exists between them, and not merely a relatively minor difference about the meaning of words. Mr. Cousins believes that work-sharing is preferable to redundancies, the Government argues that it is bad because it discourages labour from moving to other occupa- tions: nothing, apparently, could be a plainer contradiction than that. Yet Mr. Cousins is all for encouraging short-time workers to move to other industries where they are needed, and the Government certainly does not claim that the first reaction of any-employer faced with a drop in orders should be to dismiss immediately all those. who can be dismissed without much cost or trouble. The Compromise The problem in practice is to strike an appropriate compro- mise-to encourage labour to move from one job to another rather faster than it would like to move and to get employers to run down their labour force :ather more gradually than they would sometimes like. This compromise can only be achieved by proper consultation between representatives of both sides. Whether the strike of car delivery drivers is justified is a question that must be answered according to the particular circumstances of the case There is no differ. ence between the TOWU and the Government large enough to justify a strike on the principle of short-time working.",

   "text_content" : "BY HAROLD WINCOTT W ELL, the Liberal Party bhad a good romp at Brighton, didn't it? I'm not referring to the young bloods, bless them-although they clearly had a field day-but to the top echelon of the party. There was Lord Byers saying what we have all known for years-that because of over, manning, concealed unemploy- ment and under-employment, so far from being short of labour, we have somewhere between 24 and Sm. people available for productive work. There was Mr. Peter Bessell. MP for Bodmin, saying, on the very same day, that to Liberals \"one able-bodied man out of work is a crime; and we pledge ourselves not to rest until be is employed again.\" Now I don't know whether Maskelyne and Devant were Liberals. But I do know we're not going to shift Lord Byers' 21-Sm. underemployed folk into productive work by waving a magic wand and without com- mitting a good many of Mr. Bessell's crunes. Minimal Chance Of course, you can argue that the Liberals have a minimal chance of forming a Govern- ment, and that a minimal sense of responsibility is therefore all you can expect from them. But I must say I was shocked to read that Mr. Heath, in his election- style tour last week, was seeking to make capital out of Mr. Wilson's statement on July 20 Liberal crosstalk-Peter BeeUll an Lord Byen. about the future level of unem- nlipvment Mr. Wilson, you may recall, said that, looking beyond our present troubles, beyond the re- absorption, the redeployment and the measures for regional distribution, if we had an unem- ployment percentage of between 1 and 2 per cent. he did not believe such a figure would be unacceptable to the House of Commons. Mr. Heath said Mr. Wilson was \" content to see nearly half a million unemployed as a permanent feature of our national life,\" with the obvious vices and industry alike and all implication that he, Mr. Heath, its unique circumstances, the un- wasn't. employment percentage never I rate this statement by the fell below 0.7 per cent.

First, during the last war. with 196,000 has been out of work all its conscription into the ser- for more than eight weeks; and si 11 0 Ir t a a b r I e C S C :5 II e N p d :s V e a a d I- S n y U* v Y r * I. I. of these 142,000 were for one reason or another virtually un- employable. The genuine national figures for unemploy- ment then were 54,000 and the percentage rate about 0.2 per cent. Now the academics debate among themselves the validity of the Phillips-Paish argument that, given an official level of unemployment below, say, 2j per cent. it is impossible to con. trol wages and prices; to keep increases in incomes within the bounds of the increases in the volume of goods and services on which they can be spent. Labour Turnover As an ordinary chap, I.would have thought events over the last 20, years had proved Profes- sors Phillips and Paish to be abundantly right. But since, for all our faults, it is not really ex- cessive rises in wages (relative to our competitors) which have undone us, I am more concerned ft with other facts of so-called I- overful employment. r There are factories in this t* country-at least there were 3 earlier this summer-which sus- Y fered a 100 per cent. turnover in 1; their labour force. This meant, to spell it out, that on December 31 everyone who was working there on the previous January I r would have left. In practice. the position was even worse than D that. because the managers and ) executives, and a certain propor- tk ion of the workpeople, were j long-service people. So for * December 31. you should pro. bably read November 30, or even October 31.000 were for one Now whatever Mr. Bessell and Mr. Heath may say, these sac- tories must, in the nature of things, have been operating way below maximum The fficiency, and what goes for them goes in greater or lesser degree for the whole country. I talked about this to an American friend of mine, one of those strange ad- mixtures America breeds-a Wall Street man but a great radical. No Lasting Avail Harold,\" he said. \" the man. agement of such a factory wants its head examined. Give the workers a 5 per cent. bonus pro- vided they stay 12 months, a 1 per cent. bonurs at the end otwo years, and o on. It would pay the company hands down.\" \" And if the factory next door made it 10 per cent. at the end of the first year and 20 per cent. at the end of two years?' I asked. \" Wour fthat really happen?ot my friend repled. I told him t cive to- tainly would have in the con- ditions then frevailincts of so and he said, \"Well, give up.' So does management, and so long as this state of affairs pherevals alle fDepartments of Economic Affairs. all the Prices and Incomes Boards, all the apcountry-peals to recapture the Dun. kirk spirit will be of no lasting avail. An unemployment rate of just over I per cent. places an of Just over 1 per cent. pleace an intolerable strain on human nature. Mr. Wilson has bad the courage to realise this. He has had the courage personally to take responsibility for measures aimed at reducing the level of demand and raising the level of unemployment. He is not. the first politician in Britain to do so in the' post-war years. But he is the first to tell the British people that when the present isqueeze and all the readjustments which must follow it are over, they must get used to the idea of up to 500,000 people being out of work, and that they must give up the idea of work-sharing to frustrate the process. Of course, other things must happen at the same time to alleviate hardship, to retrain people. to avoid unconscionable levels of unemployment in cer- tain parts of the country. Rut the major basic decision has been taken. If Mr. Heath seeks to make capital out of that deci. sion. Mr. Wilson will flay him alive-and. on the Tory record, not without reason. Other Issues There will. in any case, be plenty of other issues on which the Tories can criticise the Government. I believe Mr Callaghan had the truth 'n him when he told the Group of Ten five days after Mr. Wilson's package in July that deflation and Government economies alone would do the job. But because, as the New Statesman has said, the crisis affords a wonderful opportunity to po ahead with full-blooded Socialism, we are lumbered, or probably shall be very shortly. with all the paraphernalia of socialist authoritarianism. We've had it before, of course --only then a Labour Govern- ment inherited the controls- and in the long run it neither worked nor did the British people like it. History will repeat itself. The British are not naturally the nation of informers they are now being encouraged to become. Labour cannot take away from them the option of getting the hell out of it. Not just the doctors and the pilots and the footballers. But now I see even the bricklayers. SET Problems Labour will go on making mistakes, as it is already making mistakes. Chopping and chang* ing its mind, for example, on the fiscal aspects of SET, whether it's to be passed on, or whether it's to hit profits and thus reduce investment. So overloading the Ministry of Labour with the mechanics of the same tax that the Ministry cannot now handle all the problems involved in the unemployment being created. Let the Tories and the Liberals hammer the Government on issues such as these, but not on Mr. Wilson's decision to end. once and for all the state of impossibly overfull employment Continued on Page 17",

SBT would have some justifisca tion if all industry paid without return, but although it is notorious that British manufacturers carry too many idlers., this hasty, blindly directed measure will actually subsidise the very thing it might combat. The most iniquitous example is the publishing ladustry. It is notorious that half the number of printers who are employed publish- ing would be ample were it not for restrictive practices. The actual failure of a newspaper with over lm. circulation is attributed to this; Also in my own experience I have found that better quality of printing and better service can be obtained at lower prices from abroad. Yet printing which is so notoriously overmanned is rAted as manufacturing although nothing whatever is manufactured (if no lies are printed, of course).",

Four years the Mianist of Housing reached heoncludou that if may of its by.r lare share of the sector .would have to be mehfanmsd methods, This .wa Sdiret cptosequence of the fact tba the 7 rge ta ere wel beyoni the cpabilfy of tadi tional buildit methods with Maaylai e \"l aoW r sor e, Sir SitbmiJ ; orders hisl In. dt odr and with boe them, . contractor dsendÃ½ebabd bilders ruse to ump on the bandwaggoa. Unfoisnately developing. a workable buildgng system. let alone, manufacturi ngand sellng it to local houing committes, is a comnplicated business. Thus of the 64 systems so far celti fled by the National Building Agency, barely half a dozen have more than 500 houses on order. Many of the Orms who have produced systems, often under licence from Scandinavian or Prench companies, have lost heavily oh their outlay. The number of systems has been falling steadily as the losers are weeded out, but even for a large and successful firm, profits have been slow and small. Thus Taylor Woodrow, which has a system building subsidiary with Anglian. has only just reached profitability, and still needs to recoup earlier losses. Good Market Despite the initial difficulties. the market for some form of industrialised building is good. The Ministry of Housing draws no distinction between true industrialised building, in which walls and structure are precast in a factory. and highly rationalised traditional building -using, say, concrete poured into moulds on site. Both these methods -are developing to. gether, and between them account for some 35 per cent of the tenders plated in the first half of 1966. This is a substan- tial increase on the 15 per cent. level when the Ministry's drive started in the early part of 1964: the National Plan target calls, of course. for half a million houses a year. of which 100.000, or 40 per cent. of the public sector. would be indus- trialised. The distinction between fully industrialised building and highly rationalised traditional building is important. Wimpey, which is perhaps outstanding in avins opsi mot eficlent forms of labouraaving I.t ite work, can produce bcf of lats that are fully tive with current Indus* trial sed techniques. Wimpey, in fact. completed over I, dwtings In 1965, sompured a wft only. 1 by. the lexadII induAria Many of the mapM taken raisins produant. bav led to a p li Gro pnWvW, rined t-he ;epcy of itradltioeal i U lii taroov Yorka e p trop \"I to Wal-l funwa sU la~Cpo., place large orders for indus- trialised housing, has been able to' reduce the number of man houts needed to build a tradi- tional house from an average 2,665 in 1949 to a mere 800. This compares, though, with 75 man hours on sitework of an I industrialised system, and the scope for improvement in sac- tory methods make it inevitable that the cost advantages will swing towards fully industri- alised systems. The Costs In 1965. the average costs of I building tall blocks of fats .were some 12 per cent. lower under an industrialised system. On low-rise flats of two to four storeys, traditional methods were still somewhat cheaper. and for houses and bungalows. at which traditional builders amre highly efficient. they were sub- 1 stantially cheaper. Average figures. though. are highly mis- i leadins since the standardis of different projects may vary appreciably. and the use of non- standard components will add substantially to the cost of, industrialised building. Concrete, which has been the most profitable of all the system uilders, with 13,000 units of its iton hihgbrise system ordered. he horison. Its low rise gys. tao introduced \"1st year. already has 1,700 otders. and a further 3000 are kely to be Iacd io the next few months.

Certaily be poteial mrtI ir n lowe rise contain only a few tll b fIo surrpUnded by CtScr of three- and four-storey blocks. Providing that housing authorities are able to curb their natural desires to specify special features. there is no doubt , that industrialised methods will gradually take over the public sector. Lalng feels that its Jespersen system will be competitive in two-storey build-. ines next year. under fairly strict conditions. The penalty of varia- tion is well illustrated by the fact that non-standard wall units take up to 2%, times as long to produce as the basic unit. With overheads allocated at Â£1 a minute, costs, can soar. The logic of the production line will dictate that standardisation in components. though not neces- sarily in the range of buildings that can be produced from them. will proceed much further. More parts are likely to be fabricated in the factory. The industry has reached an important turning point. Until now. the biggest builders have concentrated on streamlining existing methods by using con- crete blocks cast on the build- ing site. Laing's Easiform. first developed between the wsn. and Wimpey's No-Pines, each have much higher production flaures than any of the true industrialised systems Laini. by investinp to Jespersen. has shOw ii wher. it teaels Ue, ture lies, and with 4.000 units under contract, and 11.000 under intent, It can scarcely be dis- appointed with its decision. Last week. too. tenders were put in for the Orst stages of what will eventually be the big* gest Industrialised housing contract o, all. the 60.000 homes in the GLC Woolwich- Erith develppment. But despite all the indicitions of a rapidly growing tarket. there are still a good many problems to solve. Even the most successful firms are working well below capa- city for much of the time. Partly this is the result of the difivculty of tailoring order dates to production schedules. A delay of six months in start- ing work. which may be of little importance to a tradi- tional builder, could be very embarrasing for a systems factory. The formation 9f. large consortia. such as the Yorkshire Development Group, to phase orders and provide the large -contracts .which make system building economical, has been too slow and on too small a scale. Compared , with, say. Denmark. British houising com- mittees expect far greater varia- tions to suit their individual needs. This may make sense if it avoids the proliferation of monotonous blocks of grey. identical, fats familiar in the Soviet Union, but too often it merely impedes standardisation with little aesthetic benefit. The Future System building is certainly well established. In high rise housing, it can be expected to sweep the market, as firms like Concrete become able to under- cut the traditional methdcs. But progress toward* the system-built two storey house. which most Britons would live in if given the choice, remains very limited. Traditional methods are at their most effec. tive here. and since only 40 per cent. of the cost of this type of house is attributable to the builder, there are correspond- ingly few chances of cost cutting. The success of industrialised building must be measured on its ability in the next few years to win contracts from local authorities for low rise housing, on its design merits. For indus- trialised building remains the protected sector of the local authority market. which is itself relatively immune from credit squeezes.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STfP There will be disappoinPme11nt that Bryant Holdin profits have fallen short of forecast despite turnover passing the target (see Lex. Page I.). Savory. and Moore profits are a shade off but the current year holds better promise add Jackiso Brothers (Knottligley) has had a good half-year: but British Thermostat has sustained a check and L. Gardner is cutting the interim payment. In the Insurance sector Commercial Union shows a smaller under. writing loss in the first half (see Lex). Savory & Moore Although Savory and 1Moore's 1965-66 profits are far from excit- ing at Â£140.000 against Â£142.000. they look better than might have .'been expected from the chairman's statement last November.. In fact. these figures probably bear little relation to the group as it is now. For with its wholesale chemistf' activities under pressure from in- tense competition and the -trading pattern gradually changing, severe reorganisiation has be'o undertaken. Old premises were closed, new ones opened nearer customers, unprofitable hospital contracts were terminated where possible and a new central offite established. The physical side of the shake- up is completed and administration is now being reshaped with the help of industrial consultants. Even so. it is clear that benefits are already beginning to materialise. Both turnover and profits for the first five months are better than the comoarable period, and it is under- stood that heavy bank borrowings have been cut. Thus the decision to keep the annual dividend at 8 per cent.. despite earnings of only 8 '/ per cent. before unsoeci- fled minority interests and after a full tax charge, seemingly reflect that the aroup should now begin to get profits up towards the record of Â£276.000 of 1961-62. The shares at Ss 9%d yield 6.9 per cent. and sell on 134 times earnings. British Thermostat A rather sober interim statement from British Thermostat reveals the Board's expectation of a reduc- tion in pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 next. A shortfall in the region of 10 per cent. is antici- pated. which means that the profit is likely to be some Â£574.000 and cover for a maintained 27) per cent. dividend down from around 1.6 to 1.3 times-the interim is held at 5 per cent. The position at the half-year is not too. bad; sales are Â£154.000 down at Â£3.35m. but a slight improvement in mar- gins leaves the pre-tax figure only Â£4.000 lower at Â£308.000. But while the Teddington Air- craft Controls subsidiary his maintained its progress. the auto- controls side is expected to be 6mairb Ro r 'of products g o tile conaumwe durbes ket this is ironical. as a fall in profits on this side has up to now been primarily caused by- labour short- aPs and steps to rectify thi4 posi- tion were bnder eonsideratn.

   "text_content" : "By reason of factors outalde directors' control, Malayalan Plantations faces this year a I \"uevere reductionu\" In profit in terms of sterlina I Chairman Mr. John Sands says that in 1965-66 the record crops and profit enabled, by offsetting the impact of the recent U.K. tax changes, the dividend to be maintained on a gross basis. 'M . - . - 'I- .- a- -- - -- This year, however, on the tea I side, increased costs, low prices and the heavy export duty must result in reduced margins of rupee profit, while the strike of rubber workers, and the consequent loss of crop, will cause rubber profits to be lower. The final rupee profit, when remitted, will sufr a further reduc- tion in terms of sterling at the new devaluation rate. Lower Crops The tea crop, while makig a \" very ood\" start in the current season, and almost level with last year's by the end of August at 10,95m. Ib, s not expected to exceed 25m. Ib com- pared with 26.48m. lb in 196566. Mr. Sands adds that tea market prospects for the current year are distinctly unfavourable.\" World production, as far as at present nown, is still running at about 50m. lb ahead of the previous year and it would appear there will be a sub- stantial carry over at the end of 1966. That, he says most continue to exert a depressing effect upon.pies for all fut the 'few outstanSding viality teas Simultaneously with devaluation, an export duty of about lOid per pound, raspuBOsed-upon.S al .tass. South Tndian teas are now realising less than pre-devaluation prices on world markets. Those two factors will place many producers in a \"precarious position unless the strong repre- sentations made by Planting Associ- ations are taken note of by the Government of India and a sub- stantial reduction of duty granted. Depending, as it does, upon the settlement of the strike of rubber estate workers, which started on July 4 and is still continuing, the 1966467 rubber crop is \" impossble to fore- cast.\" Up to the time production ceased output was almost level with 1965.66. To date, however, the strike has cost some 2m. lb of rubber and even if tapping were to be resumed immediately, not more than about 10m. lb could be expected for the. year. The loss of crop is \"particularly disappointing\" in view of the higher market prices beine ahtdaia for the rubber crop im-mediey prior to the strike. \"Disappointment\" The chairman says it is a \"bitter disappointment\" that, te immediate prospects are less favo'aftbeNever- theless, the high productivity at the company's estates, 'bicked . by \"strong\" financial resorces \"places us in an excellent position to take advantage of an improvement in conditions.

This colt by Mossborough put up a useful performance on his last outing when finishing second to Farmer Giles at Thirsk. and before that he defeated Creosote by a length over 1% miles at armouth, though admittedly he was receiving 2 st. from Lord Rosebery's four-year-old. The danger to him may be Aura- Luminis, a well-bred filly by Premonition, but she is Inclined to take a strong hold and proved too much of a handful for her appren- tice rider here last month. The Southdown Handicap is one of two races to be run- over the \"frying pan\" course of approxi- mately one mile and five furlongs, the other being the Ditchling Handicap (4.30). In the absence of Resistance, Fuengirola may win this race. It is a long time since Scarletta showed any worthwhile form. But if one goes back to the evening meeting at Kempton on May 6, one finds that she carried 8 st 3 lbs into fourth place behind Queen of the Troops, Eze and Bosun's Whistle. She barely stays five fur longs but she may just last out the distance here on 1he firm ground, and, if she does, will probably win the Glynde Plate (2.30). Spaniard's Road, narrowly de seated in a Â£1,000 \" seller\" at Sandown in July, has -Impressionist to beat in the Battle Selling Plate (3.30)' and it may be significant that Pigfott has elected to ride top~wig- King Anmnophis for T. Goslng's Epsom stable in the Navill Nursery Handicap (4.0), and Suez Canal for T. Corbett in the Lewes Stakes (i.0).",

   "article_dc_title" : "August Car Output Rises, but Sales Fall 14%",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Our Commercial Editor The official figures for car production and new registrations in August, both issued yester- day, clearly display the background of the present crisis in the industry. Production was -.,. . i., M an .- 1. A' ' . *LB As - d-4- ir * _^_t up by nearly 9,500 at 107,649 Registrations for the full moni margin at 59,253, nearly 14 per 68,535. Since exports have been running consistently behind the 1965 figures, this represented an in- dustry-wide addition of perhaps 20,000 to stocks of unsold cars. But detailed figures circulating within the industry show that BMC's own stocks rose by a con- siderably larger figure to their total of 115,000 on September 1. All the other major manufacturers were reducing stocks. In the same way, the rise of 9,000-odd in production masks a much bigger rise in BMC output compared with 1965, accompanied by cuts by most other manufac- turers. BMC, which had lost some 10,000 vehicles in labour disputes in August, 1965, not only made this good but raised its schedules by a further margin estimated at well over 10,000 cars. Vauxhall and others were not only making precautionary cuts in schedules but lost production through the intro- duction of new models. The registration figures are the only ones in which the experience of the industry was more or less uniform; BMC, according to current estimates, at least main- tained its share of home market sales. For the year as a whole, the industry had still not lost by the end of August the flying start in home sales attained in the first half of the year. At 866,637, the xor me Ioer-weeu peruoa. b were down by almost the same cent. below the 1965 figure of cumulative total was still nearly 10,000 ahead of that up to August, 1965. However, current estimates indi- cate that the September figure will be at least as bad as that for August, and possibly worse (regis- trations in the two months were almost exactly level last year). This would wipe out the remainder of the lead and produce a signifi- cantlv lower total by the year-end. Cumulative Total The cumulative production total, at 1,141,020, is again a little above that for 1965-but by less than 3,000 cars. This lead was in fact established during August, after the squeeze came into force; the sluggish performance in the earlier part of 'the year was due to de- pressed export shipments. The commercial vehicle figures are much more encouraging. Output, at 29,197, was 2,840 above that for August, 1965. But in this case home registrations were also up-by 663 at 16,231-and exports shipments also rose. On a seasonally adjusted basis commercial vehicle output over the last three months was some 6 per cent. below the 1965 level, but. this drop was more than accounted for by light vans, which have been a shrink- Ing market this year. The Board of Trade also issued new statistics yesterday-its estimate of motor trade turnover in July, on the eve of the squeeze. Thin showed an 8 per cent. rise in public expendi- ture on motoring as a whole over the year, and a 9 per cent. rise in the value of new car sales; Since the number of registrations for July was slightly down, this may be an over-estimate, or may reflect the grow- ing market in 1966 for medium-sized cars. The one warning of a setback at this stage was the stagnant market in second-hand cars, where the value.of sales was only 1 per cent. above that for July, 1965, and actually below the 1964 level.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Miaing Editor Bethlehem Copper Corporation. one of Canada s liveliest young copper producers, the fortunes of which have been followed here rom time to time, has issued some Rood figures for its second quarter, us pushing up earnings prospects for the financial year to next Feb- ruary. But shareholders should bear in mind that this British Columbian producer, which sells Its output to the Japanese and which started pro- duction at the beginning of 1963, was having its share or teething troubles a year ago owing to an earth elide In Its East Jersey open pit which led to a changeover to the lower-grade Jersey pit. An ebullient expanslon programme hsa been designed to oT$et this setg back and In the quarter to August 31 average daily ore treatment rose to 9.610 tons compared with an initial rate of 3.300 lons and with just over s,000 tons In the same quarter of last year. The present target is 10,000 n with the pouiblllty of a further rease to 12,000 tons In due course. Quarterly net earnings per share of 34.1 cents contrast with 8.9 cents a year ago, making a six-month total of 6.7 cents against 23.6 cents. Bethlehem has established a 10 cent quarterly dividend rate and It Is hoped that hlis will be maintainable despite capital expenditure requirements, the onset of taxation and, of course, a lower price for copper. Bethlehem S0-cen shares were $6.70 in Toronto on Friday compared with a range so far this year of $5.50 to $7,23, Broadly speak na they tend to move In accordance with the ebb and sow of the open market price for copper. LAKE VIEW HOLDS ITS DIVIDEND The Londonnbaied Australian old nrMavliar Leta VIeuw and Ilsar t dI ylrrrrrl Irm rrrr Â·r maintaining its dividend for the year to last June with a final of making a It 3d total. The pro from mining Is put at Â£249,167 which s practicall the same as the L230.329 for 1964%5. But there would have been a greally different story If it had not been for the Austraaln Government subsidy for which the company now qualifies. As previously announced, the actual mining surplus for the past year was only 25,S00 com- pared with Â£283.035 in 196465 but a payment of around Â£152,000 was expected under the revised Australian cold MIn\"ing Industry Asaistance Act of 1965. it if acneraill assLmed that It was thil sUaidy factor that persuadod te U.K. Treasiury to maka an excep. jon n grantn Lao View permit. sion t tra oier ith control to Australia, 1 wie, under corpra Uon lax, the U.K. woldinefect have boen drawn ou artby of the Auatrli ndGovernment, Th norelary resolution for the tranier of control is to be put to shareholder t an extraord nary mue\"ll\" ng t. a ter I N lnJ annuail meeting. me t sent out on Friday, a ew ar were unchanoed yesterday at l1a 3d.

   "article_dc_title" : "Don Pasquale",
   "text_content" : "by ANDREWW POATER ,R The Welsh National Opera's, autumn season opeted last night in Cardiff with a new production of Don Pasquale. It is a pleasant performance, but overweight at the moment. Above All, the orchestra -the Bournemouth Symphony-Is too. loud. Donizetti scored. the work pretty fully, and gave his' two trumpets, four horns and three trombones plenty to do; but Bryan Balkwill encouraged them to what in the New Theatre seemed a posi- tively Wagnerian volume. As a result, the qualities of grace and high-spirited gaiety were too often missing. The performance had good humour, but it lacked sparkle and delicacy But these may come, once the singers no longer have to struggle to ride the accompaniment. On the musical side, the virtues lay in a full-blooded, never superficial treatment of melodies; eloquent string playing, for example, of those four touching bars which accompany Pasquale's entry after the servants' chorus; and generally. so cutting of vocal corners but a full moulding of all the charming .phrases in which the opera abounds. This is a good founda- tion for one of the more carefully composed comic scores; but now the performance needs a lighter touch. For last night, the ensembles tended to become free-for-alls, everyone going full out and Jennifer Eddy going under. Miss Eddy is on the way to being a charmiing Norina. In places she displayed a pretty flexibility: she was elegant in the nocturne, but less than captivating in the cavatina. Stuart Burrows, the Ernesto, also shone in the nocturne; the serenade lost pitch, as it so easily can, and his aria, though smooth, was sung too robustly, too beefily. Michael Maurel was, vocally and dramatically, a rather characterless though competent enough Malatesta. The title role is ias taken by Oeraint E i0 , 1i i international star applg-a I similarly, Bji~ing did B t I Nilson does In Staock l- Sthe local company of h native- Sland. s He gives a peroti lovable a performance, not quite so polished a in detail as we might have hoped, a but ripely apealing. Up to a 1 point, Don Pasquale stages itself; t all the producer must beware of is buffoonery- \" business\" that gets I an easy laugh bat doesn't spring 1 naturally from the character con- i cerned. Such a piece of gratuitous i clowning was Mr. Evans essaying an Eros arabesque when Dent's translation introduced the word Cupid. For the characters-of the opera are consistent; it is a cleverly - written comedy, not a farce, and most enjoyable when played as ' such. (A famous comic feature of .1 a immense Lablache's Pasquale it used to be his efforts to retrieve f the billet-doux from a floor he b could hardly reach; that's an r example of natural business.) F. But on the whole Dennis Maun* a der's production was clean in outP g line, and not caricatured. The a crucial moment.after Norina has L- smacked the old man's face, when y for a while we suddenly touch a v more serious level altogether r (almost that of Lorca's Don Perlimplin, which is a tragic Don s Pasquale) was very well handled- i, by Mr. Maunder, by Miss Eddy j and Mr. Evans, by Mr. Balkwill. s Well handled, because the balance a was iust right, and the transition e back to comedy neatly effected. e Elizabeth Friendship's scenes are t skilful and attractive, Ileither e stuffily foursquare, nor \" abstract,\" e but at once open and reasonably ; realistic. A special word of praise 3 for the Welsh chorus; I have often h heard Don Pasquale in English, but 3 never before heard every single i, word of the servants' chorus. The r performance was a success; and if t later ones are lighter, they will be e more succeSsful still.",

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON The New Philharmonia Ensemble is a group of wind and string players drawn from the orchestra of that name and there- fore composed of some of the finest players in England. As a group, they haven't on last night's showing achieved a very definite personality as yet. Perhaps they were discouraged by the poor atten- dance. The audience, sparse as it was, would have decently filled a smaller hall. and the music would have sounded more immediate. The relaxed, happy atmosphere needed for the serenade-type works they played was not easily found In the big hall. Two of these works, Mozart's Serenade in E flat (K.375) for iind and Dvorik's in D minor for wind, with cello and bass, are masterpieces. Spohr's Nonet (mixed strings and wind) is not, though his fluency and craftsman- ship is to be admired and to a mild extent enjoyed. The Nonet may be more fun to play than to hear; there are engag- ing and entertaining things, but they pall by the time they come round again, either as the recapitu- lation of a sonata movement or as the repeat of a scherzo. Spohr's slimy chromatic writing sounds as if he were trying to impress col- leagues with his modernity with, out offending his rich patron. The finale's Biedermeyerish charm brought some warmth into the Ensemble's playing, up to then rather cold and non-committal. The Mozart, too, had been strangely stiff and buttoned-up. Such players could hardly fail to re- spond to the marvellous Adagio, but there were points of balance there as elsewhere that needed clearing up. Quite simply, the tune didn't always sing through. For the Dvordk they had a con- ductor in the person of Norman Del Mar, and the increased supple- ness and warmth of the playing suggested that they might have done well to have one throughout. This was by far the most enjoyable performance, worthy of the delightful, irresistible music that the Serenade contains-unlucky Spohr, to have the mock-profundity of his slow movement shown up not only by Mozart's but by Dvor6k's as well. The balance by now was much better (though some important cello phrases were covered) and the three horns pro- vided a splendidly rich and secure foundation.",

   "text_content" : "Pby D4ENY: $WO itor ofApk When the bitory of the appte- atslioo of Pierre Bnnhard's art comes to be writtn,- some aocount will have to be. glved of' the ay O''which hisi drawinls and gouaahes were for so long neglected. The explanation lies not in * any quirk of taste but largely in the fact that many of such works were more or less out of sight until the conclusion of the litigation involving the Bonnard estate. Yet the virtual negle6f of Bon. nard's drawings did mean that some critics felt that he had com- posed his pictures without any assistance from sketches. It can now be seen that the master was a prolific draughtsman. Drawing, indeed, formed the basis for much of his creation. There are sketch- books dating from the 1890s which contain notes of themes* which were subsequently worked up into some'of his most characteristic compositions. It is clear that he enjoyed playing around with ideas in pencil, pen or charcoal. Only a . large-scale exhibition would permit the evolution of his concept of drawing to be properly illustrated. Meanwhile, we must be grateful to Mr. Victor Wad- dington for arranging, in col- laboration with the Miles. Bowers a most attractive exhibition of drawings and gouaches. This opens to-morrow at 25, Cork Street. Although some of the works on view have been seen previously, the bulk are shown for the first time. The elegant cata- logue. which contains a perceptive introduction by Patrick Heron, one of the first of the post-war generation to appreciate Bonnard, is a valuable document. All the items on view are reproduced in it. some in colour. Even this small exhibition suc- ceeds in providing further hints about the range of a painter whose contribution, as the Royal Academy sihow emphasised, was more varied than had often been considered. Fortunately the present show contains works from nearly all phases of his career. Bonnard started by drawing those scenes from Parisian life which captivated him. We may find him noting down the appear- ance of a mother and child, with more than a hint of Japonaiserie in the result, a typical bourgeois couple out for a stroll .(echoes of Raffaelli and Steinlen here) or children going for a walk. The last-mentioned drawing is con- nected with the well known little Femme an paraplule-study for a lithograph picture in Mrs. Mellon Bruce's collection. In his early drawings, Bonnard knew how to ring the changes. At I times his touch is delicate, and, refined shading is used to suggest the values enclosed by a vigorous outline. At others he adopts a r sharper approach, and ink and ! watetcolour are employed to sug- r gest the movement of skaters. The I existence of such- a drawing, no* i doubt done after nature, is valu- , able for the genesis of the cele- i brated picture of skaters in the I Hahnloser collection. It reminds . us that such early decorative paint- Sings with their Art Nouveau affilia- tions had a grounding in reality. g One day the relationship between Bonnard's drawings and lithographs will have to be determined. He was one of the brilliant group of artists who in 19th-century France profited from the popularity of lithography for illustrations and posters. The very nature of the lithograph requires simplification. The artist has to make his point succinctly and immediately: short hand is demanded. Bonnard never forgot that he had to present the colour values in his drawings for this medium, and the almost im- pasted charcoal drawing of the Femme au parapluie, which is a study for a lithograph, does just this. His relationship to the spirit of the 1890s is brought out in this -show bYthe;,wo tfÂ»NzÂ» or Vierrot--wy a0 Â»So& from Vr i poetry meant muct InI ThIS sonr of dr i.acike an mo sardonic., emphuise too the con- oactlons between Bonnard's vistpa and that of Picsao in his Blue period. Both wetorepots of lonpu. . oess, symibolid in their painting of the nude; both also menr admirers of the classical ideal. in their different fashions. One of the. most curious aspects of Bonnard's arts is its note almost of hallucination. He could render figures so that they quiver with intensity, as if they had stepped out of a dream into the area of vision. - He could make the ordinary, seem very startling as in the pen drawing of four .women. one holding a child in her arms: the touch of torment in the line calls to mind German Expres- sionism. The extent to which Bonnard's art was radically altered by his visit to Hambuirg in 1913 was indicated in the Royal Academy exhibition. One wonders what might have happened if Bonnard had been compelled to experience the topsy-turvy life'of ,Germany during the 1920s. As a lover of the nude. Bonnard made many splendid drawings of the female body. These range from figure studies which reveal his admiration for Degas to more personal sketches in which he made \"one little room an everywhere.\" In some of his most brilliant draw- ings, the image can be read in two ways-as a vision of space and colour, suggested by the interplay of lines, and as an. evocation of mood. One of the most telling, despite its almost ghostlike appear. ance, is the sketch of a woman on the threshold of a room. It is a haunting drawing which again sounds the note of loneliness. I The exhibition also contains a ) number of beautiful gouaches. The E four seascapes are especially : emotive, In these he showed his F ability to charge even a small I picture with the intensity and ; radiance that can be discovered in his large works. They throb with t his revelation of the power and t poetry of the sea. -As in the oil r paintings, each passage contributes I to the total effect and each sec- r tion remains delectable in itself. We may even be reminded of the way in which the French .illu- minators of the middle ages also t secured similar effects when work- ing on a small scale-effects of brilliance and idealisation. There is, of course, nothing brash about Bonnard's art. His visual perception of colour was combined with an almost aural sense for its harmonies; both attri- butes were subjected to an intel- lectual grasp that permitted him to organise, as it were, his sensa- tions into a coherent whole. How much this feeling for unity owed to the structural exercise of draw- ing can now be grasped. I Â·",

   "text_content" : "by JOHN HIGGINS Forza has only been staged professionally in London two or three times since the war. When it has surfaced.fate has tended to treat it in much the same way as it used poor Alvaro. The first time I saw it performed was eight years ago by an Italian touring company. The production opened on a bitter January Satiur day night at Drury Lane. The fog, which earlier in the afternoon had obliterated the second half of the international at Twickenham, moved downstream and by 7.30 had taken position in the upper parts of the house. The performance started late; the scenery did not fit and the Intervals became longer and longer while the fog grew thicker and thicker.' Forza is scarcely a compact opera, and at 11.30, some time after all public transport had been brought to a standstill, there was a thinnish audience to see Fra Melitone dole out the last act soup to the old and hungry outside the Convento della Madonna degli Angell. Sam Wanamaker's disastrous Covent Garden production and Floriana Cavalll's equally dis- astrous London operatic ddbpt as Leonora form more recent history. Yet was the stasing quite as bad as we all thought? Were the designs that Wanamaker produced himself, having rejected those of the artist engaged for the job, quite as puerile as we all said? One would like a chance of reappralsing Wanamaker's Forna, but presumably that will never come for when the kind of past the opera needs is assembled (Jones, Coasotto, BerSonl, Pischer. ieskau, Evans, Crass?) It can scarcely be risked In a production whose death warrant was signed on the opening night. Certainly, Form is a be at of a work to stage. Mar herita Wallmann's solution at Vienna where It hides under the title of Di, Macht dea Schlcksals despite the fact that It Is purrently sung n Italian, is to treat it as a straight rwrd piece of grand opera Ift grandeot.

Wakhevitch's scenery also caused a lengthy hold up between Leonora's interview with the Padre Guardiano and her subse- quent induction before the assembled. brothers, which is pos- sibly the finest scene in the opera and which is closely linked musically with what has gone before. The ear was sacrifceood to the eye. So It was In the last not, Alvaro and Carlo began their final duet In brilliant Spanish sunshine, but by the time they reached Leonora's retreat It was pitch black for the sake of having the darkness of the closing eoon# illumined by the white robes of two monks and one eudo-monk, SomoMne too should av restrained the soprano from obbing out of h r mountain cell to acknowledge ths applause for 'Pte, paee, mlo Dio,. (But an we in England too austere in objecting to breaks in the action? The night before at the Budapest Opera the baritone in Don Glovanni signalled the conductor for an encore of \" Finch' ban' del vino\" before some no more than .amiable applause had the chance to die away.) Vocally the performance was on a high level. James McCracken was an outstanding Alvaro. The voice was warm and free enough in the duet with Leonora to make one curse Pikve for allowing tenor and soprano to meet in the first 20 minutes of the opera and then keeping them apart until its close. \",O tu che in ceno agli angeli \" was sung just as Verdi commanded, trlstemente ma con forza, although McCracken not the most spry of tenors, was unwise to end it on the wrong side of the stage so that there was its full length to run before he joined battle with the Germans. Mario Screni began by giving the type of indolent, sluggish account of the Student's racconto which would not have passed muster before a cola-drinking, open-air tourist audience. But once In uni. form he was transformed. The Carlo.Alvaro duet was triumphant, and Seorni displayed a large and sumptuous Verdi baritone of the type that Is in short supply now' adays in \" Urqa fatale.\" Antonletta Stella was the Leonora. If It was not an exciting account of the part, It was a perfectly professional one. The upper register remains clean and pure and was heard at Its best In , Pace, pace, mlo DIo,\" but the voice lacks the power to encompass the arch of Verdi's soprano melodies. Stella was also up against formidable competition in her Prezlosilla, Florenza Cossotto. The gypsy girl's rabble*rousing songs may not be subtle, but given Miss Cossatto's dash, fire and bril. Ilance they are guaranteed to strike sparks out of any audience. Walter Kreppel and Karl Ddnch were the Padre Guardlano and the Fra Moll- tone respectively. In sum, a musically exciting performance of a difficult opera, and one with which Vienna had every reason to be well satisfied.",

   "text_content" : "by B&N WRIGHT * by^ B^tN V Dark rumours heard at Csfpdarth Park, Newcastle, last week, ab ut the future of the Senior Serv=ce' tournament, and the extnordnary * squabble over date, t1it threatns i totemove the Picadiy atch plaVy ( event fro'tbhe fixture list, serve only to emphaise that the British professioaWl olf tour has arrived i at a particularly dangerous cross- i road. One has heard of other sponsors besides Gallaher's who, because of the economic situkilos, are being forced to consider carefully whether they can afford to continue to finance major tournaments. There are. aipn that lucrative one- day professional-amatiut tourna- ments, brstli-jg with celdbrities, are liktly to replace some of these 72-hole stroke-play events. The Variety. Club has already raised vast sums of money for charity in this way, .and there are signs that local industries have begun to ap- preciate the publicity value of sponsoring these one-day events. At Gosforth I was told that Â£5,000 in prize money would be offered by a well-known benefactor at one such charity event next season, and I met an industrialist who said he was ready to make that kitty \"look like chicken feed.\" If the Senior Service tournament is to disappear, however, it will be because young executives prefer a hard sell at-local events to costly maior national promotions. One appreciates their point that the latter may publicise the company, but they don't sell cigarettes. At the same time, however, so many hours of BBC television coverage seem too good a commercial to miss. We shall see. The decision of the PGA to allot to the Â£56,478 Alcan ' Golfer of the Year\" Championship the first week in October next year, a week already occupied by the now firmly established Â£16,000 Piccadilly match play event, is almost beyond comprehension. One suspects that the majority of PGA members dis- like the Piccadilly event because so few of them are considered good enough to merit invitation. This situation can only be remedied by a drastic change of attitude among themselves. . What ails Britain's golfers? In 1 winning at Gosforth Coble Le. t grange (South Africa) became the Â» fourth overseas golfer to win the ' fourth major p4ise or title here I this summer- icklaus took the f Oven. Devlin the Carting, #ad 8 Thomson the Match play title. I Legrange differs from this trio in I that his natural talent is far from extraordinary, but his deficiencies as a striker are fully compensated * by courage and dedication to hard i work. After a tournament round, I Legrange makes for the practice V grounds. He has suffered a con- a siderable relapse, notably in I. America. since winning our I Master's Title two years ago, which is not surprising considering the artificiality of his swing. One could a perhaps allow that be needs to e practice more than some of his d shore gifted British rivals to keep n such a mechanical game in trim, 3 but that is hardly valid after he has I- won this tournament. 'f Another young man who spends much of his spare time on the prac- It tice ground. is the Australian Bob e Stanton. Although only 20 years t old, he won seven tournaments in ;t Australasia last winter and has it already earned almost Â£L,000 on his e first British visit, apart from the title of German Open Champion. it It seems certain that he will eventu- e ally take over the mantle of his a illustrious compatriot Peter Thom- y son. He has a fine method, but the e youthful desire to hit the ball out e of sight occasionally betrays him, i, as it did in the Spanish Open, when at he ran up a nine in his last round. y At Lindrick I watched the lone ;e Stanton practising in cool pink o twilight after the sun had dis- appeared behind the Pennines. At it Gosforth I saw him going through if a similarly exhausting routine as it cold mist rolled in off the sea. k British professionals complain that y they need sponsors, and indeed y financial aid is essential if a young d man is to make his mark in this I' it\" intensely competitive sport. But s- the continual failure of our players e even remotely to threaten foreign d dominance of world class golf is 'merely strengthens their growing ly reputation for lack of industry and a determination. And in these hard times, an investor demands a fair n return for his money."

Professor -I W*L*;Y THOM . ;^ ~~CDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, ITW S .\"\" DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, UNVRIV0U~~o'WALESA\"ONMO 100rrÂ·i~i; Every government in the last 20 years has had a conscence about the development areas and to atone for the distres& suffered by these areas in the 1930s, it has become an article of faith that there most be fair shares in full employment. In the record of achievement since the Distribu- tion of Industry Act, 1945, Wales has been an outstanding success story. Recently, however, there have been signs, quite apart from the impact of the balance of pay- iments crisis, that the WelsH economy is running into tur- bulence. Between 1948 and 1964 Wples's share of British unem- ployinent was halved, from 12.9 per cent. to 6.7 per cent.; but in the last two years there has been a reaction and the proportion has risen to 8.6 per cent. The big question is whether, from a long- run point of view, this is a neces- sary pause while there is re- grouping going on in the growth sector or whether there is more serious instability. Substantial Growth The spectacular changes of the last two decades can be seen in perspective when we recall that in 1938 one quarter of the Welsh working population was engaged in coal mining. By 1965, the pro- TABLE I Average hourly earnings In jmanufacturing: Men 21 and over, April 1966 Region Pence Wales .............. 115 Midlands .......... 114.

If we include steel and tin- Lt plate, the manufacturing sector h now comprises one-third of the d insured population of Wales. There has been substantial growth in nylon, chemicals, engineering and electrical noods, enportion eerin that eledustrical goods almlen tm, oil refining and a wide, range of trades producing c27 ponsumer goods. Another strik- ing indication of a wheconomic mate, ity and rising affuence insur the factpu that professional, sentiherec ans beeniial servicestantial now account for 13 per cent. of the Welsh working force, the egine proportion as for Britain as a whole. Steady Advance Through indica combination of Government aid and private initiativethere has been a steady advance towards a diversified economy, Emiploeri in the neo indPstries i have d W h Altog t6 main Idea in th ~ -r~r--~ ~-Â·- u~uu Â·rrr Â·u rur early stages was to take work to the workers, the industrial structure which has emerged has very few artificial elements. This is borne out by the record of productivity. The latest available Census of Pro. duction figures showed that the index of net output per em- ployee, taking Britain as 100, Was 117 in Wales as compared with 108 in the north, 107 in the south-east, 96 in Scotland and 91 in Yorkshire. It is sig- nificant. that men in manufactur- ing have higher hourly earnings in Wales than in any other region in the country. The figures for April, 1966, are shown in Table I. -These high. earnings reflect the relative weight of capital- intensive metal. manufacture, nylon and chemicals in the indus- ttial structure. South Wales accounted for a quarter of the 27m.. tons of crude steel pro- duced in Britain last year. Prac- tically aB the tinplato and 80 per cent, of the sheet steel made in t this country come from 'South Wales. Large plants such as the , Spencer Worksi of .Richard, \"sbomas and Baldwin at Newpott 1 and the Steel Company of Wales' k Abbey Works are using the most 1 modem capital equipment. The a same applies to ICI's huge nylon factory at Pontypool and the new e developments in petro-chemicals. e The difference between fluctua- > tions in unemployment in Wales e and in the country as a whole is t- shown in the accompanying 0, graph. The national picture, I dominated by the Midlands and a London and the South East, has d been one of variations in the I- intensity of excess demand for - labour.. In Wales the peaks in s unfilled vacancies have always a been lower than the troughs i r unemployment: only once in the ' last 20year has Wales been near to having general excess demand t for labour, and that was in June, 1955, when unemployment fell to , 1.6 per cent. Recent experience relatively to the rest of the a country is shown in Table IL Labour Market r During the last year the labour i market has become slacker in i Wales relatively to other develop. ? ment areas. A few years ago the I' rate of Inemployment in& Scot t land aind the North of England was about a third higher than in Sharp Contraction But there are deeper forces at work, Hitherto, there has been a balance between the modern- ised steel and coal industiles and the new manufacturing sector; many of the marks of the old industrial North were being dis- carded and Wales was becoming \"t more like the industrial south. he Recently, however, there has on been a sharp contraction in the w coal industry, and steps are to ' be taken to diminish over- sa- manning in the steel industry. es The National Coal Board has is declared that in South Wales n8 only 45 pits now employing 'e, 38,000 men have an assured ad future; 21 uneconomic pits em- as - ploying 12,000 men are to be W' closed. and 19. pits employing ?r 14,700 men -have a doubtful infute. Ls These large-scale programmes a of labour redeployment, coihcid- he ing with a deflationary check to r the growth of the bnew nianu- Id facturing industries, are likely to e, increase unemployment in the to short run, but there will be com- ;c pensating long-run gains to pro- he ductivity. There are fears that some of the new factories, which are subsidiaries o6 parent firms in England, will be among the first to fall victims to the ur deflation. in It depends how severe the p- effects of the monetary squeeze eto will be. tÂ» Since depreisiontip likely to bit nd the motor-car industry, this is. in bound to react on the Welsh in. future. t wrebengdi These large-sale programmesin Ile ing with a deflationary chick t ir he . growth I *,of e the 'pw. anu d fctuingindustries are likely to a, increase unemployment. in thery shrtru, u there wila Col be com-a ai ductivity.

   "text_content" : "'This review compe at ta exciting star in the eonomidc 'and'industiil developmnt of post-War Wales. The exttit and quality of our post-war industrial growth is.amply demon- strated by the artits on the following pges. The revw paints a'stmlating picture d Wa a. h problems, it achievements ;.poten atia SIt wll be seen that Wales is a challenger for a lace amongthe industrial front-runers ofBrain, and1 ided, of the world. A massive injeion of capital, both y the state d :,by private industry, lhas- given the Principality a wide range of new, up-to-date industrial capSy and, assocated with th ts, an average produ- tivlty rating above that of any' other United Kingdom industrial region, and 'wage rates, la the manufacturing sector which are above the British average. In coal-mining, steel making, petroleum. petrochemicals, elebtrical engineering, alu- minium and in many other of the techno. logically-advanced industries, Wales now has plant capacity equal to the best anywhere. This new investment has not only rejuvenated our older, basic industries, but by introducing new' industries, has 'widened -the basis of our economy. Proof of the attractions of Wales as an industrial location and of the effectiveness of the measures being taken, by the Government to strengthen its economy is to be seen in the acceleration of new factory projects in the last two years. Thus, in the first eight months of 1966, the issue of industrial development certificates in Wales has covered 725m. sq. ft. of floor space as against 4.5m. for the whole of 1965, which, itself, was a record year for Wales. In the year ended June, 1966, Wales took 11 per cent. of the total British stock of new factory space, whereas in the year ended June, 1964, her share was 4.8 per cent. The measures that have bad to be taken recently to put the British economy as a whole on a sounder footing will, of course, affect Wales. But, as a Development Area, the greater part of the Principality will escape the full rigour of some of these measures. Moreover, the incentives to new industrial growth that will now be available under the Industrial Develop- ment Act everywhere in Wales, except in our North-East and South-East corners, will increase the attractions of investment here relative to other parts of Britain and will mean that, when the recent restrictions are lifted,.we should be in a very favourable position indeed for further expansion. The Welsh Office is particularly concerned to ensure that the new industrial growth will be- matched by the necessary improvements in the infra-structure of services. We are already seaping the benefits of the inivestinents made over the last five years in the Welsh road system: road access, particularly to South Wales from London, Bristoland the Midlands, is being dramatically improved this year. Projects are in hand and others are in course of preparation which will continue and expand this work to the benefit of the whole of Wales. The authorities concerned are being pressed to push ahead with water and sewage schemes expected to be of economic value and major investments are being made in port facilities. I am convinced that Wales has before it an industrial future that;will enable it to make a great contribution to the British economy.",

The immediate prospects facing all the steel producers are gloomy. There is a general weakening of demand; profit margins are under pressure; price-cutting may spread from export markets into the U.K. itself; and nationalisation is looming closer. But, as far as the Welsh producers are con- cerned, they can console them- selves with the thought that, whatever structural changes come about through rationalisa- tion or nationalisatibon, Wales is certain to retain a very im- portant position in the industry. Indeed, South Wales has been ,singled out in the Benson Report as one of the three most favour- able growth areas for the future development of the industry, the others being North Lincolnshire and Tees-side. It is true that the Benson Report may not be fully accepted by the Government in all its details-it was commis- sioned by the British Iron and Steel Federation-but its main conclusions about the three growth areas seem )lkely to form the basis of future plhaning. Virtual Monopoly In South Wfles the Report envisaged the development of the two large.litegrated works- 'Steel Ciopay Wales' Works at Port 'T alb t and Richard Thomas and Baldwins' Spencer works at Newport - to a capacity of about 8m. tons by 1973, Under nationallsation these two companies will almost certainly be brought together into a South Wales group. This would represent a virtual monopoly of U.K. tiplate pro. duction (unless Colvilles In Scot- land, which has expressed an interest in moving Into the tin. plate market, is allowed to do so) nda very large share of sheet production. But the argument of the nationallers (bared by some \" ratloni rs \") s that the scope Oath Sthe' Orm; to et : which is short of hot-rolling capacity, sends slabs to the Spencer works, and the steel is returned in the form of hot coil to be converted into sheet or tinplate. This sort of sharing arrangement is bound to become more common in the future, whether the industry is publicly or privately owned. Meanwhile SCOW itself is en- gaged on a massive programme of modernisation designed to produce more steel, of better quality, at lower cost, and with fewer men. In common with many steel producers through- out the world, the company has decided to scrap its existing open-hearth furnaces and replace I them with three very large LD oxygen converters. At the same time, strenuous efforts are being made to bring the company's manning scales in line with the most effidient world standards. This involves more I delicate issues than the straight. forward replacement of plant, but the two are inextricably intertwined; the installation of new equipment makes it all the more urgent to solve the over- i manning problem, since the i profitability of the investment i depends on efMlcent manpower i utilisatlbn. At the Spencer works of RTB the needis not bo much for new investment, but to increase 1 throughput so that the existing i investment is properly used. The company has received permis- sion from the Iron and Steel i Board to raise ingot output at 1 Spencer to 2m. tons, but this is ' still a long way short of the i optimum level. Export Business The plant has been making heavy losses, as had been ex- 4 pected and the cqnversion to i profitability may be further de. I layed by the weakening of I demand. RTB has built up a I very useful export business, i especlally in the US., but it has ( already begun to eel the Rlects (4 of lower demand at home. i For both these companles It i has long been recognised that, i Lew port facilities for the hand- I lin of foreign orn would be 1 needed. Action on this -front is coming at last. In August SCOW signed the contract with the British Transport Docks Board which gave the go-ahead to the Â£17m. deep-water terminal pro. ject at Port Talbot. This will enable the port to accommodate ore carriers of up to 88,000 tons capacity; at present it can handle ships of only 10,000 tons. Meanwhile RTB, having con- sidered and rejected a plan for a deep-water jetty extending into the Bristol Channel, has decided to go ahead with the alternative scheme of an impounded basin at the mouth of the River Usk, near Newport. This new plan has been submitted to the National Ports Council for approval. Two-New Ports When these two new ports have been built, the companies should be in a position to receive imported ore as economically as any steel producer in the world. They will still, of course be at a disadvantage in relation to their Continental rivals because of their inability to use American coal. But it seems unlikely that there will be any change in Government policy on this point for some time. The build-up of the largest and best-located steelworks inevit- ably involves the running-down of the small and )badly located plants. This is a policy on which everyone is agreed, but putting it into practice is another matter. The howls of protest which have come from Consett following the publication of the Benson Report Indicate the kind of resistance that will undoubtedly be made when changes In the structure of the inpdustry are attempted. As far as South Wales is concerned RTB's Ebbw Vale works is clearly not well located from the point of view of raw materials and consumer markets, but this does not necessarily mean that It is doomed for 6losure in the near future. In- Iel, siXeable investments are llbejn ade there; plans for k Â£4m. galvanizing line were recently anaounced. What may appen is that Rbbw Vale win lad to 'be converted Jato a s specialist works, dealing with / types of finished sheet and tin- e plate that are required in fairly I small volume, while the Spencer e works deals with the mass- w production items. Ebbw Vale I. could becoine a specialist non. e integrated producer, receiving its s semi-finished steel from Spencer. The other large integrated works in South Wales is that of Guest Keen at Cardiff--again, a not a good site for big expansion, ) but a works which still has a i number of years of useful life : ahead of it It is possible that i here, too, some kind of specialisa- tion will be the best way of using i the existing production facilities. a This works clearly does not r, justify the kind of large-scale capital expenditure which SCOW .is now undertaking. As ftor North Wales, the position of John Summers' works I at Shotton has always seemed paradoxical. On the one hand, it Is one of the most efficient and lowest-cost sheet producers in the country. On the other hand, the site, some miles inland from the sea, does not seem ideal for I large-scale expansion. No Expansion t The Benson Report came to the conclusion that North Wales I could not be ranked among the Sfirst three growth areas and that no large-scale expansion was I required between now and 1975; I by the latter date the Shotton works would be producing rather more than 2m. tons, comr I pared with 4m. tons apiece from SPort Talbot and Spencer. In the I longer term, however,\" the comrn mittee has taken the view that North Wales (Deeside) is well suited to development.' In the committee's view North Wales ranked higher than Scot- I land as a candidate for really largse.oale expansion but lower than South Wales. North Lin. colnshire and Teso-side. It Is possible to develop deep-water ore handling facilities on the Mersey so that, In this respect, the Shotton works can be made as competitive as the two South Wale producers. Thus, if the Benson Report's conclusions ar accepted, the long-term future for Shotton remains bright.",

   "text_content" : "By DENNIS TOPPING, Our i Correspoadet aLy JLFu 1' Beneath the Welsh hills liea some of the most varied, usable and highly priced coal iU the world. To the east of a 90-nile- long mining belt are huge reserves of high volatile fuel. In the west lie virtually all of Britain's available resources of anthracite. Between them runs a whole range of valuable coals. suited.to every purpose. One hundred years of unremit- tingeXploitation has_ already. yielded 3,000m. tons; another 2,000m. tons are known to exist, and estimates suggest that this figure falls short of the true total by 3,000m. tons. In the valleys they say with pride: \" If this lot was in America or'Russia, they'd. be shouting like hell about it.\" Yet the South Wales coalfield is to-day perhaps the most troubled of all the'trouiiblsome regions administered by Lord Robens, chairman of the National Coal Board. In 19 years of State ownership, the deficit on its operations has exceeded Â£100m.--\"far more,\" as Lord Robens himself has pointed out, \" than the accumu- lated deficit of the Board as a whole.\" If manpower problems throughout the. industry are acute, then in South Wales they are seen in chronic form. Well over Â£150m. has been sunk in modernisation scheies' yet still the existence of the a dpends upion the profits the NC Bcan wrest from regiois like York- shire and the East Midlands. Pruning Operation What, then, has gone wrong? The answer lies in the aitare of, the South Wales pits, and: pos- sibly in the temperamint of some of the people who' man' them. Before World War I, coal from the valleys was shipped to ports throughout the world.. Afterwrds came the years of depression, with their devastating effect on the out- look of the Welsh miner, and then World War II, which virtu- ally spelt the end of the export trade. When the QCal' Board' took over the industry in 1947, over 200 pits were being worked in the coalfield. Now the total stands at less than 80. In part, the object of the jprSmit.operation #ocia d but idje~icflbtyi a Â·has ben to vn- centrate output on fewer but more prod t1414 `7nmoWf'\" highly-mechanised coeries. Where once the overall output per manshift was 15 cwts., the fgure is now approaching twice this level. The South Western Division of the Coal Board, which is responsible for the coalfield, reports staggering achievements from some of the AbermaA 'a Major project to work the anthraci e resources of the western sector of the South Wales coaleld, which Hes between Pontardawe Ia the Swamnea Valey and iwaencnae;Gurwe in the Anuman Valey. new Welsh drift mines, which have built-in adviantages of low. cost transport and full-scale mechanisation. \"Look at Cwmigli,. where we have achieved five tons per shift for every man employed,\" they sug- gest, \"'-or Trelowis, where face- Sworkers have topped more than S50 tons per mait in a single shift -ithe highest. coalface output ever recorded .in the coalfield.\" Results such as these offer justification for Lord Robens' I claim that large-scale rationall- r. sation points the way to stabills. ang or reducing production costs. But practical implementation of the modernisation programme has brought other problems in Â» its wake\" The biggest of these. $ ib the effect that closures have r had on morale. As has been the \"case in other regions many 'miners have succumbed to the theory that the rapid rundown t signals the beginning of the end I for the industry. Lack of faith Sin the future has probably beend more intense in South Wales than elsewhere, possibly because of the legacy of bitterness handed down from the bad old Sdays; V' -r Assured Life :I . NCB ofcials have done their t utmost to remove the men's fears ' and suspicions. Attention is Â· constantly being drawn to the k many incentives now offered to persuade a man to move from Sa dying or uneconomic pit to I one which has an assured life. s This policy, too, has met with some success. Over the first seven months of this year, more than 2,800 miners have moved. But as many more again could have been switched to more pro- ductive pits; it is not easy to per- suade the Welsh to move from one valley to another, even if the distance over the hills is only a mile or two. Manpower Shortage As the pits-have closed, so the drift away from mining has intensified. The acute shortage of manpower has also been aggravated by an above-Average level of absenteeism. The in- dustry as a whole is particularly subject to this malady, because of the tough and exhausting nature of the work. A cold in the head, which a white-collar worker is prepared to suffer in the comfort of his draught- proofed office, can well be a very legitimate reason for failing to turn up -for a stint in the dis- comfort of the coalface. Relatively mild forms of sick- hess, however, are only one of many reasons why a Welsh doner fails to report for work. If Is aevin duggsted -that the high level of Shabeintees fn'the Welsh coalfield is -due in part to the temperament of the people. Accustomed as they were to poor living standards and rela- tively low wages for many years, they are said to be more resis- tant to the temptations of the affluent society. I go down the pit for our days a week because I can'rearn enough to live on in three\" is more a truism than a joke among some Welshmen. Absenteeism and the general drift away from the mines have combined to produce difficulties in working some pits. Even the most modern and expanding col- lieries like Cynheidre, Abernant, Brynlliw, Nantgarw, Cwm, Bed- was, Merthyr Vale, Wyndham, Lady Windsor, Tynmawr, Aber- cynon and Deep Duffryn are looking for recruits in an effort to lift operations to their most ,economic level. Production costs in the region are in any case relatively high, because the pits do not give the large tonnages which are avail- able from some collieries in other parts of Britain. Further Cutbacks Only one pit, for example, yields more than 500,000 tons a year. While costs remain high, the market for coal cannot be fully exploited and the NCB's planners are forced to consider further. cutbacks. The more frequently they wield the axe, the more crushing the effect on morale-and so it goes on, a vortex which threatens eventu- ally to suck all else down into it. If the Board can check the exodus of men and change the habits and attitudes of the people it employs, there is no doubt that coal will continue to be mined in South Wales for many years. But to the observer, looking at the situation against the background of recent experi- ence, the \" if\" appears to be a very big one.",

Its pruoal tasks are to btÃ½ eeg tbhe national need with the needs of Wales; to ensure that growth in Wales contributes fully to U.K. growth; to ensure that devolution of responsibility is constructive, not destroctive. In this work, the key problems lie not so much within the area of direct responsibilty as in that of planning and in the province of \" oversight\" or co-ordiastion of departmental policies. The principal machinery for this co. ordination is that of the various Cabinet committees and Welsh Minlsters, as members of these, are will placed to ensure that the needs of Wales are taken into account and that the measures being taken by different departments are complementary.

The cv unem log ratr cen. sin0n pocketsth situation is quite grave. At Milford aven, for instance, 9.9 per cent were out of work last July. In the Rhondda the figure stood at 45 per cent, and at Merthyr Tydfil they counted 4.1 per cent. Additional Jobs Wales is still very much in the throes of change: the older in- dustries-coal, - to some extent steel, railways, agriculture, slate -continue to contract or make do with less labour in the course of modernisation. At the same time new employment oppor- tunities are springing up. During the past 12 months over 30 new firms set up shop in Wales, pro- viding 2,500 jobs; and 15 estab- lished companies increased their labour force by over 100-add- ing up to 3,500 additional jobs. In fact, Wales is now only three short of the 109 industries. listed in the Ministry of- Labour's Standard Industrial 'Classifica- tion. But all these changes concern people-and they are not always willing to do what the planners prescribe for them. Take coal- mining, for instance.

Of course, the next e Digest is likely to show quite a v distinct shift New Process t More changes are to come. a During the first six months of s this year the rate of issue of in- . dustrial development certificates ' 1 for projects in Wales has been running at nearly three times the 1965 level.

At present depopulation losses are fairly mar*ginal, although this has not always been the case. Some 40,000 workers aged over 15 years left Wales between 1954 and 1964. But in the meantime there has also been a progressive increase in civil population. In the early 1950s this averaged 4,000 a year: in 1964-65 the growth numbered 15,000. How- ever, in mid-Wales the rate of depopulation averaged nearly 3 per cent. per decade ever since 1871--and there seeins to have been an increase to 4 per cent. during the past decade. Not only are the rural parts of Wales affected, but so are the valleys such a the Whondda, where the civil populio fell by 11,000 between 1951 and 1961. Piot Study At the same time, indus- trialisation in mid-Wales has already rePahed its limit-and the reason is solely that the necessary labour is simply no longer available in the area. More pebple have to be brought back-hence the Rhayader pro- ject of doubling within 10 years the current population of 1,250. The Government has spent Â£5,000 on a pilot study, and if this re-populating project works, it may well be repeated in other small mid-Wales towns. It is in the more rural areas of Wales, too, where trades union organisation is weak.. On the whole, the industrial parts of South Wales are well organised at shop floorlevel, and in the north-west organisation Is high in the traditional industries as well as in most dof the new ones. The majority of trades union members in Wales are affiliated to the Welsh Advisory Council of the TUC .(member- ship totals some 440,000), which is represented at Congress in its own right. So these unions, in fact, are getting \"two bites of the cherry.\" The feeling is that, provided sufficient miners stay in the industry (which, among other things, means funds and houses to encourage miners to work in neighbouring long-life pits-in fact the NCB is about to intro- duce a \"mobile employment van\" to be taken to pits which are about to be closed to make known detailed job opportunities elsewhere), more advance ; factories are being built in the valleys to employ labour on the doorstep, as it were, and indus- trial development is brought as closely as possible to the val- leys, \" being pushed up them and into the middle,\" the Welsh employment problem may be brought very much under con- trol within the next five years or so.

Eight years ago the beads of frms in Wales gave clear in- dication of their faith in the future of the Principality by forming the Development Corporation for Wales which has as its purpose the promotion of Wales as a location for In- dustry and as an expanding manufacturing area,. Much has been done, so much that those who have been absent from the Principality for a long period are astonished to observe the changes which have taken .place when they return. Trade Misgion Now In addition to the oriinal basic Industries, coal and steel, upon which we once relied almost entirely and which today are stll of vital im- portance to the economy, there are powerful industries such as switchgear, aluminium, motor. can, chemicalo and heavy en- gineering to mention only a few.

Such problems present a chal. lenge whlobh the Welsh people will tackle with confidence. There has grown, in recent years, an enthusiasm and buoy. ancy which I am confident will contribute towards forther and wider industrial development. What has been achieved up to now has been due to combined efforts by Governments, lochl authorities, trade unions, organlsation smuch as the Do.e velopment Corporation and many individual persons. Some of the firms which have been established in Wales since the war have had finanolal assistance from the Government In the form of grants, loans or reasonably rented factories, but I emphaslse that this is not the whole story, numbers have come without luch assistance, because they considered that Wales was the right location.

This applles particularly to those who have disabilities assoclated with the. mining industry but who are fully capable of working in a factory. Firms who have had experience of this type of labour in the past have been very satisfied. Expansion Projects I have had personal experi. ence of operating plants.both In North and South Wales, and I can confidently ay to those who an presently giving oonsidera* ton to an expanslon project that they will find no better location than Wales. Any nation or region must in the long run depend on the spirit of its people. The Welsh are keen workers, adaptable and eager to learn.

   "text_content" : "By RICHARD JOHNS In Wales the mainstreams of economic life tend to run laterally, west to east, a fact that is reflected in, the administrative boundaries of the electricity generating and supply industry, as well as the NCB. But it is in no way irrelevant to think of the country's energy needs as a coherent whole. The Government is committed to a policy of balanced regional development, and the whole of Wales has been scheduled as a development area. Fuel costs, which must be a factor in any industrial development policy, compare favourably there with those elsewhere. But economic trends appear to be working against them in a way that no planner should ignore. Pump Storage It is well known that, in terms of electricity generated, Wales is a net \" exporter.\" In the South Wales Division of the CEGB's South West Region, only 71 per cent. of electricity made was used in the 'division's area- 7,926m. kWh out of 11,110m. When two stations now under construction, Aberthaw \"B\" and Pembroke, are complete in 1972, capacity.will be more than doubled from 2,450m. MW to 5,950 MW, In the nirth,;which is covered by the North West Region, there was also a surplus, 1,864m. kWh over 1,700m.'kWh, if one does not take account,of the heavy demands of the Fes- tiniog pump storage scheme for off-peak electricity to pump the water up the mountainside. . Festiniog is one of seven hydro schemes in the north, some. f them uneconomic in purecost terms but, nevertheless, valuable contributions to the grid. There is only onecol-fitred conventional station -as C6nna's-- Quay, providing over half the total generated, and the Traws- fynnydd nuclear station. Wylfa, with a capacity of 1,180 MW, is scheduled to come into operation Ia 1969. In the south, as befits f a traditional 'coal - producing i area, only an insignificant pro- t portion of generation is oil 5 based. V This, however, will change when oilfired Pembroke comes 8 into operation, 'and with the f growing oil refining concentra- Stion on Milford Haven, the pio ture is likely to change there, I after. Proximity to an old coal. I field is not the boon that it once f was. Fuel costs per ton of bulk a supply tariff, which was lower I, than for. any other electricity v area Board in 1950-51, was fifth , highest in 1964-65. I For the South Wales Eleo c tricity Board there is also the ! problem of the relatively > slow rise in industrial consump tion. Proportionately, thp Board supplies more\" electricity to industry, more than two-thirds, but between 1958 and 1965 the s rise was only 33.7 per cent. s compared with' 41.6 per cent. 2 for all England 'and Wales. s Demand from iron and steel, r coal and chemical industries, s which account for three-quarters of' industrial sales, are almost static.-and for coal't actually r dropping. The \" once and for \" all\" Llanwern plant steelworks a accounted for much of the increase, and 'new industries 3 have tended tobe small users. St Efliciency Rating Despite a good rating for industrial efflciency. (13.3 per cent. of costs in 196465) the ' Board's distribution 'costs are high, and it lias already the largest rural electrification scheme of all in relation to its a size.' In the north, by contrast, i, where prices are in any case a governed by sales in the more i,\" densely populated areas of the e Merseyside and North Wales F lectfridity Board, industrial a coniumption has been leaping e ahead, and may.' show. an - increase of as. much as a quarter i, for 1965-66. s The main .preoccupation of a the Wales Gas Board in recent a years has been the switch from p S.

In 1964-65 over 85 per cent. of supplies were bought, 65.7 per cent. of it coke- oven gas from the steel plants of the Steel Company of Wales, ,Guest Keen Iron and Steel, and, in the north, John Summers. The increasi in g-eneral dqiband and the deciease in the amount of .coal needed to make a- ton of steel has necessitated an increase in capacity. Since the autumn of 1962, this has risen by 93 per cent., while overall demand has risen only 24 pet cent. Figures for 1965-66 will reflect i the impact of the Â£3.5m. E. M. Edwards plant, near Neath, which' started operation late in 1964, though, partly:'because of teething troubles, it has been i running at less than 50 per cent I load factor. The plant, with a S capacity of 45m. cu. ft a day, k manufactures gas from light : petroleum distillate from BP Llandarcy. In the north, the E catalytic rich gas plant at t Maelbr, near Wrexham, comes I on stream this year. Cokeoven gas has meant cheap gas for Wales in the past. In 1964-65, at the last compara- tive count, Wales, with an indus- trial price of 13.5d per therm, was second only to Northern at 13.2d. But the price advantage will prove difficult to hold. Industrial demand, which rose 247 per cent. from 1948 to 1965, increased by about only 37 per cent. in the 1959-65 period. Generally, sales are not increas- ing as fast as in the more fancied Midlands and South-East. Dis- tribution costs are high, as the Prices and Incomes Board pointed out in 1965 when it up- held the Board's last price increase and warned about the continuing pressure on prices. Gas Grid Wales is not yet connected to the natural gas grid and so does not benefit from Algerian methane. North Sea gas, when it comes, will be farther away from Wales than the Midlands and the South-East. It is hoped that natural gas will flow into Wales by 1970-if a differential price is charged, the disadvantage to Wales would be immediate. Neither electricity nor the gas supply industries are meeting financial objectives of, respec- tively, a 12.4 and 10 per cent. gross return for the 1962-67 quinquennium. Next month's figures for 1965-66 will only accentuate this trend. In Wales, meanwhile, it is felt, that a regional development policy, if it is to make sense, must take account of fuel prices. The plea is for less arbitrary targets and an elimination of any handicaps that might make for an unequal starting point, so that Welsh fuel costs can remain com- petitive with those of more favoured regions.",

   "text_content" : "By GEORGE'THOMAS, M.P. MINISTER OF STATE, WELSH OFFICE As Welsh Ministers, we have been keenly concerned from the outset to tackle the problems of the rural areas. These may not be serious in scale-but they are acute. With the steady decline in employment in agri. culture, and because there were not enough industrial or other jobs to hold them back, people have moved away altogether; this steady depopulation has eaten into the economic vigour of entire areas and called for increasing subsidy of different kinds. We determined that this situa. tion must be altered not only to give the people of the area a decent chance of prosperity and the amenities of lcvilised living, but also so that the area as a whole would make a proper contribution to the economic effort of the United Kingdom. New Industries We know that before October, 1964, much study had been given to these problems; and against this background we decided to assess the possibility of major urban development to act as a focus for Improvement, to see what could be done to expand existing towns In the area to sup. fott and rationallse agriculture, bring in small-scale new ndustries at vital points and to 4aslst the other indigenous industry, tourism, Last year, consultants were commissloned to make a full. seale feaibility study of the posibility of a new town In Mid.

The Government will give financial help for the im. provement of public servcesa such as roads, electricity and water, and grants to farmers to provide accommodation for tourimt. Overall Policy A further Important oompo nent of th i overall policy Is that of sett ngmall ndutrlos in the towns, in the pat, this task has ben left large In local hands and the MiWaleas Industrial Development Asoula tion, which is a body county councll rep rentaves sup. ported. by lheDevelopm t Commisslon, have uroed In tin many *m rm to I the But the v. numI r of J% created annually in thisl way Wa too *mall in reitIon to beltso u of popul tifn an qrilnpmen wewrme'ge mto 'i ia this area so that firms can walk into a ready-made factory. Of particular benefit to rural Wales is the recently passed Industrial Development Act, which provides for the schedul- ins of almost the whole of Wales, including its rural areas, as a Development Area. Rural Wales will henceforth therefore have the benefit of all the varied forms of financial and other assistance which have hitherto been available only to industrial areas with a substantial problem of unemployment. This is a major step forward in policy and should attract a number of indus. trialists who previously would not consider settling here. Building Grants The other basic industry of rural Wales, turismn, is very. much in the forefront of the Government's mind. Under the Industrial Development Act, tourist establishments in the area can benefit from substantial building grants normally equal to 25 per cent. 'Hoteliers will also benefit from the increased initial allowance for plant and machinery, which will be raised from 10 per cent, to 30 per cent. Government effort cannot suc- ceed in isolation and it is especl. ally heartening to record that local authorities throughout rural Wales are responding to the need for local Initiative. Not only does the Mid-Wals Industrial Deve. lopment Association continue to enjoy their full su porti Indivi. dual local authorilies are very ready too to provide key. workers' housing for incoming industry and to consid:r I. provements In public services. New housing development, generally in the rural areas cvO bieen at a commendably high standard, and the new subsidy structure which takes account o eitra costs involved In this ty of low-denlty building will help th authorlr tI o uinoaes te efforts still further.

Total Output In recent years an average of 1,000 hired workers have left the land iannually. Although the number of agricultural hold- ings has been decreasing too, the decrease has been concentrated mainly- in the smallest size groups, and it is likely that so far as numbers of farmers are concerned the part- and spare- timers have decreased more than the full-timers. Agriculture is relatively more important in the Welsh economy than .it is .in the economy of the U.K. in general. In Wales, agriculture contributes about 4.5 per cent. of the Gross National Product as compared with 3.5 per cent. in Britain. Nevertheless the productivity of agricultural land and labour is lower than in the U.K. generally; Wales has 9 per cent of the UlK. agricul- tural land but .produces only 6 per cent. of the total agricultural output, and output per. man engaged in Welsh agriculture is about 85 to :90 per cent. of the U.K. agricultural average.

The wide variation of farm Sincmes even between farms of similar size and kind is notorious, and for this reason, in Wales as elsewhere, it is difficult to generalise. Nevertheless, it is generally true to say that the combined effect of low produc- tivity and the small general size of business is to create a low income problem in Wales, which is rather more acute than in most other farming areas of Britain.

Now new policies are pro- posed. They include grants of various forms to encourage amalgamation of small farms to form commercial holdings (de- fined as those which provide employment for the farmer and at least one hired worker), the promotion of co-operation be- tween farmers in the practice of farming as well as in their selling and buying activities and the establishment of Rural Development Boards in problem areas (of which it is understood that Wales is to be one) charged with the duty of promoting and co-ordinating rural development in general. The possibilities of developing tourism and the recreational use of land have also been widely canvassed but are. not yet the objects of concrete policies. Regional Policies It is beyond the compass of this article to examine each possibility but :some general comments are apposite. It is now ftirly generally accepted, albeit reluctantly, that amalga- mation Of the least economic holdings is desirable and will go ahead irrespective of official encouragement and inducement. To the ettent that official inducements are provided, it should be recognised that the problem is not a purely agricultural. one. Persons displaced from or denied entry to farming by a I reduction in the number of I farms must be found employ- t ment in other spheres, and if f they are not to contribute to the e further depopulation of rural e Wales it is desirable that t employment be found for them f within their own localities. This is not simply a matter of the 0 economics of depopulation but a matter of considerable cultural and social significance not always appreciated outside f Wales. B Welsh farms are often the I repository of Welsh traditions s and culture and are preservers 1 of the language. Agricultural policies which would weaken c them in these functions without a -corresponding strengthening I elsewhere would be unaccept- 'able to many and would be 1 strongly resisted. t Regional policies for agricul- ture must be part of general ' regional policies which in turn must pay due attention to r regional aspirations and suscep- i tibilities.",

   "text_content" : "By a Correspondent More than two-thirds of all the passenger stations and halts on the Welsh railway system have been closed during the past 15 years. This information, pre sented by the Transport Users Consultative Committee for Wales and Monmouthshire in April, is a measure of the reduc. tion in rail services in the region; road building, on the other hand, is going ahead. Two-thirds of these closures were in the pre-Beeching era, so It can be seen that the economic necessity for them, from the Railways' point of view, has long been apparent. Of some 1,500 passenger train route miles open in 1951 only 670 or so are still open. home 120 of these would be closed if BR, and not the objectors, had had their way. Many services have, of course, been taken up by bus companies. Travel Times On the freight side, BR are developing the lines that look most profitable-mainly those leadlugjo the southern Industrial Ibet. Trvel times to Cardiff. vs example% are being ipeded up. But the main source of transport Investment in Wales In the future will undoubtedly be the money set aside for roads. Of all the Welsh road pro. grammes the most important is without question the motorway running across the Severn Bridge to a point just west of Newport, The ridg is already open; the Welsh end of the motorway should be ready within a few months, and the advantages to the whole Severnslde region should then become a pparent.

Cambrian Air. ways, which runs its scheduled flights from Rhoose Airport near Cardiff, can bear witness to this. Rhoose is still the most important Welsh airport, but Swansea and Hawarden in Flint. shire, North Wales, both have good growth potential. Air transport will, however, for a long time ahead be of comparatively minor import. ance. It is still to the develop. ment of roads that Wales must look-and most Welshmen would say that these are not being properly developed even now. One important highway de. velopment was completed in June-the Heads of the Valleys road from Hirwaun to Aber. gavenny. This is not a motor. way, but it will provide a more direct link, and an earlier one, than will the M4.MS to Midlands industrial centres. Roads in Wales became the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Wales on April I, 196; previously they had been under the Ministry of Transport. The programme handed over amounted to Â£-.dm, for maJor schemes under way or authorised to begin.

The Welsh ports over the past two years have been carrying out I a struggle for survival as general ..cargo.ports, worthy of develop- ment, against the claim of Bristol that it should be developed at Portbury, at the cost of about .

UIAWLMOUUIJ VPLUprirUb yi0ua. The Emo refinery at Miford Haven, a deep natural harbour on the west coast. Meanwhile, the South Wales ports have fared better than some others in receiving go- sheads from the Government for development. The outstanding port develop- ment approved by the Govern- ment in recent months is the Â£17m. Port Talbot deep-water terminal project for huge iron- ore ships. Held up for many months because of disagreement over the rating assessment for the new harbour, the project is now going ahead and the tidal harbour, planned initially to acpommodate ore-carriers of up to 88,000 deadweight tons, is ex- pected to come into operation fully by the autumn of 1969. This ore harbour, serving the Welsh steel industry and other British steelworks, eventually should be capable, of dealing with ore-cArriers of up to 100,000 deadweight tons. The Port Talbot harbour will service the Steel Company of Wales and will; be operated by the British Transport Docks Board. Under the new harbour project the iron ore will be dis- charged at a 2,500-feet long jetty, able to deal with ore in huge volumes instead of in the \" penny-packets\" as a leading British shipowner said some months ago. Early Development The port, in fact, will become competitive with the progressive ore ports now in service and being developed on the Con- tinent. At present, no other British port outside Wales is equipped to deal with ore-carriers above the 50,000-ton level. There as other ore-port development schemes which the Ministry of Housing and Local Government is willing to investigate but, on the basis of its slow evaluation and acceptance of the Port Tal- bot scheme, there seems little danger of exceptional expendi- tuire on other ports being approved by the Government in the near future. Generally, however, the South Wales ports seem scheduled for early development, sooner per- haps than other ports in the British ports complex. Apart from the possibility I r r. r r. 8 0 l.

I Alternative Port With the reconsideration of a it third deep-water port now open s to Government review, the South Wales ports are. confident that they can promote the attractions of Cardiff and Newport. Sir Arthur Kirby has declared e that: \" We could provide, in my i, view, all. the capcit that is likely to be required in the Severn Estuary on the South Wales side.\" These arguments in favour of a South Wales deep-water port obviously will be heard by the Government in its consideration of an alternative port to Port- bury (Bristol).

   "text_content" : "By JOHN CARR For a region with a population of only 2im.-less than 5 per cent. of the U.K. total-Wales has a newspaper, radio and tele- vision coverage more intensive and comprehensive than any other comparable area in Britain. Few other regions can boast being served by six television channels, a long-established and popular radio network, three regional morning, four evening and more than 60 weekly news- papers. Most of these services, how. ever, have their bases outside Wales, and are not therefore nationalistic in character. And it would appear that such, nationalism as they display may become even less. Already few of the media, except for the weekly Press, are indigenous. Evening Papers For instance, only one of the morning papers, the Thomson. owned Western Mail, styled as the national newspaper of Wales, is published In the Princi. pality. The Liverpool Daily Post (gradually creeping southwards down the west coast beyond Aborystwyth) and the Western Dally-Press (published in Bristol and now circulating In the Chop. stow area) at one time had little influence on the Western Mail's overall strength. The evening papers are, as their names suggest, largely confin*4 to the South Wales Industrial belt. They are the South Wales Boho (sister to the Western Mail), the South Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening Poht, Swansea, The lone outside influence is the Liverpool Boho, In the extreme north. All these newspapers provide .a service to the community, and therefore to. those who advertise 1id them.' But their influence on Welshness is not particularly great and is likely to become less so when the Principality, ear- marked . for development, attracts more industry and more people from outside. The new. comers, perforce, will tend to dilute Welsh tradition. Weekly Press The principal area of regional influence will rest, as it has done throughout Britain for years, in the weekly Press, Not all the 60-odd weeklies are published by separate companies, but there is a demand for a variety of editions, so that In the Rhondda Valley, for Instance, one bead office may distribute as many as four editions, each under the banner of its particular distribu- tion areat' Apart' fr; radio and tele visilon and ipiited contribution from thb dailies these papers, In English and welsh, foster the survival of the Welsh language it grass roots level-in publica. lions such as Daner ac Amserau Cymru, Y,Dydd, Barn. Y Cymro 1nd the literary jourhal$ Y Genhlnen ;and Tallosin. These are the Wlshlanguage opinion makers. Th, rupCess Is liited because of the Influence of tele. vision and population migration, out they are nevertheleps the pit. props of th Welsh culture In the media of communication, SThis is not to say that tele. vision kills all t 'touches, It I just that its Influence is limited despite wide geographial cover ae. Of the sx televilsion chan. neil available in various parts of Wales, only three resac the me sh a grmme manaue mnu m use bulk of the population-BBC-1, BBC-2, and TWW (Television Wales and the West). BBC-2 has a limited radius and in any case provides nothing essentially Welsh; ITWW is split roughly on an equal basis between South Wales and the West of England so far as locally-originated pro- grammes are concerned; and BBC-1 is predominantly the London service with locally. originated programmes inserted -often at off-peak times. TWW's main influence comes through Teledii Cymru-origin. ally an ill-fated company which TWW took over after the dream of a Welsh-orientated in. dependent station collapsed eight months after its inception in September, 1962. Teledu Cymru serves West and North Wales, and has recently In' creased its output of Welsh language broadcasting, The other companies serving Wales Indirectly are Oranada in the north-aut (for thope who either cannot receive Welsh. based signals or are disinteirsted In Welsh affairs). and Teles Eireann (from Ireland) In the north-west where aain signapl are weak because of geographli cal obstructions.

Be nd n breakfast signs appear along every road to cater for the car tourist. The resorts themselves, traditionally the basis of tourism, have had to rethink their priorities.

Aberavon, in South Wales, fortunate as a new development i in being able to plan to suit the new age, acconmodates over 8,000 cars within sight of the sea. Others are modifying the. tradi- tional railway resort fabric to incorporate the essential car parking areas. Wales has all the natuhal advantages to enable it to cater successfully for the new age of tourism. Full realisation. of the potential can only come with improved communications. The Severn Bridge will be watched by many during 1967 for the expected signs of a doub- ling in touriht visitors tp South Wales. Overseas Visitors As ease of travel increases, holidaymakers become as con- cerned with the \"unique ex- perience \" as with natural scenic beauty. Overseas touriists in particular come to the Princi- pality to seek the difference, to discover the Welshness of Wales. The Eisteddfod,' in its .many forms. probably succeeds best in creating the unique atmosphere. At Llangollen, .a little town in North Wales by the River Dee, the International Musical Eisteddfod brings together cos- tumed groups from over 30 countries to compete in folk song and dance, creating a ie inajor tourist attraction for over ii 100,000 visitors each year. The Royal National Eisiedd-. a, sod, the great national Welsh it festival held alternately in North- to and South Wales (Bala in 1967 =c and Barry in 1968), is the annual a. expression of living Welsh, cul- li- ture. Welsh exiles from all to corners of the world join with ir their countrymen in celebrating eo their love of Wales and the it Welsh language. These two c w major festivals and many others n. held throughout the country are ie the focal points of the cultural' is. tourist attraction. )e The report of the Council for 57 Wales placed tourism fifth in b. order of importance among the tb industries of Wales. The Wales Tourist Board, the organisation with the official responsibility for the development of tourism in the Principality, has re- ' t5 organised itself to meet the * -challenges of the future. Eight tourist areas, responsible for the c detailed development and pro ,. motion of tourism, have been to created and. are carrying out M accommodation assessment, local catering courses and many other in forward-looking development V. schemes. in With continued substantial er support from local authorities, al tourist interest and in particular is- the Government tourism is con- 10 fidently expected to become the <4 1k second industry in Wales before a the turn of the century.",

   "text_content" : "By A. J. NICHOLAS CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, SOUTH. WALES SWITCHGEAR LIMITED The introduction of the Indus- trial Training Act, which placed the responsibility for training at all levels of skill within industry squarely on the shoulders of the employers, has undoubtedly made an impact on the attitudes of industrialists in Wales towards training. It has made employers realise that their standards of training, if indeed any standards existed, were not always what they should be. In the Principality, a number of small companies, unable to afford extensive training schemes, are now grouping together, set- ting up management committees, and appointing training officers to organise apprentice and all other training on a group basis. These companies do not neces- saily manufacture the same type of product, but are finding it economic to have a joint training department. Good Liaison la Wales, we are particularly fortunate with our technical colleges, and obtain a great deal of assistance from them. In my own company an extremely good alison exists, with day-to-day contact on a number of matters, If we require a special course to be mounted, provided the milimum number of students' can be guaranteed, such a course will be arranged. One of the many facilities offered by technical colleges is the first year integrated training of apprentices from companies who have no training facilities, and the colleges are more than willing to take on this task. Another form of help for the semller company are the courses run by the Government Training Centres, There are two such n ,tre 10' Walie-at Cardiff and . These centres were lly etablished for the re. traninI of thou men who be. olam redundant, such as miners or the rehabilitation of disabled mae as#4 women, During the last few years, however, the centres introduced courses to :ater for first-year apprentices studying mechanical and elec- trical engineering, the idea being to show the smaller companies how such training could be undertaken. These courses pro- vided an alternative to those run by the technical colleges. A certain amount of exchange fa trainees and apprentices is undertaken by my own company with other organisations, particu- larly with the Electricity and Generating Boards, where a mechanical or electrical engi- neering apprentice can obtain worthwhile experience by spend. ing a period away from his own section of the Industry. So far as block release is con- cerned, this Is not accepted by all Welsh industry as being the ideal solution. Again quoting my own company, after spending their first year In our training school, our apprentices work as part of a team, and to take them away from this team for block release purposes is not always advan- tageous to them, and we gener- ally prefer to lot them spend a day or evening a week at a tech. nical college instead. On the other hand, block release is very suitable for the generation transmission and dis- tribution Industries, Many of the senior personnel in the Welsh technical colleges are not entirely convinced that the block release system as applicable to all is ideal. Some of the technical college syllabuses, however, par- ticularly for the National Cer- tificate courses, are rather inten- sive, and day release may ultimately become day-and-a-half release, or the college year may have to be extendeds Technical Staff The attitude towards training of companies both large and small is changing, and people Sre now becoming convinced of its importance. In my own com* pany, we have always been very much aware of the need for Ie 'M hinL sop Ia as t bAlso 1 b0ool mt WOdAw WaIln Ilhshgmv.~N training the right people. When South Wales Switchgear was formed in 1942, a small handful of apprentices were reruitt., and many of these people are with us still, occupying positions of high responsibility. At our Blackwood headquarters, we have a well-equipped training school, with a staf of qualified full-time instructors, and full and part-time lecturers. In fact, more than 80 per cent. of our drawing office and technical staff are products of our own apprentice- ship schemes. Selected Regions In Wales I would say that the Industrial Training Act appears to be achieving its purpose, Eventually, many smaller com- panies, without their own train* Ong facilities, will form training groups, at key points, within selected regions. I have always been convinced that the key to prosperity is man* power, and manpower that is efficiently trained. We must encourage the training of people at all levels, in order to keep in front in world markets and at home. The future of our country depends very much on the stress laid upon training, and I am convinced that industry in Wales, large and small, must and is planning for the future to train. and train efficiently.",
