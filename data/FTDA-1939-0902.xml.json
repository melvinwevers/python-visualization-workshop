FRIDAY Evening. The swift march of events in Poland failed to disturb the equanimity of the Money market to-day. It was only to be expected that the foreign ex- change market should be dislocated to some extent, but dealings in American dollars and certain other currencies were carried out. There was no re- markable weakening of sterling in terms of the dollar, while the French franc was held by the authorities. Turnover in the bullion market was substantially lower and the price was once more fixed on a supply and de- mand basis, while silver was bene- ficially affected by an influx of buying orders from speculators and India. Interest was, of course, taken in the weekly tender for Treasury.bills, the result of which was strikingly similar to that of a week ago. Although Â£10,000,000 more bills were available, applications were only Â£5,860,000 higher at Â£56,265,000. The market syndicate fixed its bid at Â£99 Is 5d and secured a percentage quota of 59 per cent. The full Â£40,000,000 of bills were allotted at an average rate of discount of Â£3 14s 3.48d per cent., as com- pared with Â£3 14s 5.44d per cent. last Friday. Tenders will be invited next week for Treasury bills to be allotted to the maximum amount of Â£50,000,000. Business in discounts was quiet. The clearing banks were not ready buyers of short-dated paper, but there was an outlet for November maturities with the \" special\" buyer at 3%' per cent. Lead- ing houses quoted 3'%, per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts. Short-loan conditions were quite comfort- able, although a fair demand for accom- modation was reported. The position was helped by Government interest disburse- ments which contributed to the larger turnover iq the market. There was also a maturity of Metropolitan Water Board bills.

Only 60 bars, valued at Â£193,000, were available, of which 20 were married. A little arbitrage was reported. With only small offerings, a little buying of silver put prices better, spot being 1%'d up at 19%d per ounce and forward delivery ld at 19%~d.

DOLLAR FIRMER French Franc Favours Sterling As indicated above, some business was transacted in American dollars, demand for which caused the New York rate to move 10 points against London at $4.19. Commercial buying of Canada dollars also led to a 10 cent appreciation in that currency to $4.28% . The Argentine peso hardened to 18.50. Among Continental currencies. French francs weakened to 175%, but other rates, where obtainable, moved with the dollar. Dutch guilders were called 7.65 nominal, Belgian belgas 23Y nominal and Swiss francs 18%.",

   "text_content" : "A few brokers came to their offices yesterday to clear up essential matters, and there were skeleton staffs in some firms, but there was no question of busi- ness, and, with the House closed, Throg- morton-street presented a dreary appearance. People who came up did little but discuss the news as it came through, and, having called at their banks. most of them left early. One matter of comment was, of course, the decision by the Prudential Assurance Company to defer its interim dividend payment. This is merely a precautionary measure. I understand that the payment of the 1st September coupon on the Chinese Four and a-Half per Cent. Gold Loan of 1898 has been deferred for similar reasons. The raising of the tin quota for the current quarter from 45 to 60 per cent. of standard tonnages, the same per- centage to apply to the final quarter of the year, underlined the speculative attraction of Tin shares, especially the leading Malayan producers, about which I wrote on Thursday. Cable Preference A correspondent directs my atten- tion to the fact that the Five and a-Half per Cent. Cumulative Pre- ference stock of Cable and Wireless (Holdings) has moved very little in the last fortnight. At the present price of 83 the yield works out at Â£6 12s 6d per cent., without making allowance for the half-year's interest due on 30th September. I agree that this return should satisfy the long-term investor. The company must have been doing bumper business in the last few weeks, if the experience of last September is any guide. As to the position in the event of war, it is,. of course, impossible to dogmatise. However, the company operates a vital service, and it may be supposed that it would come swiftly under Government control and that the interests of stockholders would be properly protected. Manbre and Garton The Ordinary stock of ManbrB and Garton, the great brewing sugar manufacturers, has long been recog- nised as being among the soundest of investments, and the company's record fully justifies this. Earnings have risen gradually from 14.2 to 18.2 per cent. in the five years ended on 30th September, and the increase of the interim dividend for the year now ending from 4 to 5 per cent. en- courages the belief that a further rise in earnings will be shown by the accounts, which should be out in December. The stock yields a round 5 per cent. at 60s on last year's 15 per cent. payment. The company has Â£150,000 in De- ferred stock, which is dealt in in 2s units, and the' recent strength of these also reflects high expectations of the coming accounts. The Deferred stock, which has received 76.4 per cent. for each of the last two years, yields 5.8 per cent. at 26s. I shall not be surprised if the Chair- man has something interesting to say about new developments in the business at the meeting. Cuban Sugar My Cuban informant about the dangers to which that country's sugar industry may lay itself open if it does not make a firm stand against the Government's proposed new tax law (which, apparently, infringes the two cardinal international trade agree- ments with the United States and Great Britain), now writes to say that the fault of the industry is its laziness. He urges the swift co-ordination of the irdustry, so that it may be in a position to speak its mind in unmis- takable terms. It is obviously a matter of great urgency to the sugar producers to get the tax bill now before the Chban Congress put into less objectionable form, ahd, of course, the movement in this direction is of interest, not only to Cuba, but to the sugar industry of the world. l4ti (ebb Ban",

   "article_dc_title" : "Advance to 60 Per Cent. To Cover Full HalfâYear",
   "text_content" : "The tin quota has been raised by 15 per cent. to 60 per cent. of standard tonnages for the third and fourth quarters of 1939. A decision to this effect was an- nounced by the International Tin Com- mittee yesterday. It will result in an increase of the monthly permissible exports from signatory countries by about 2,360 tons to 10,400 tons. The new quota arrangement super- sedes that provided for by the Com- mittee at its meeting in Paris on 14th June when the release for the months of July, August and September was fixed at 45 per cent. That some advance would be made in quotas for the fourth quarter had been commonly assumed in market circles, in view of the rising trend of demand and a persistent fall in stocks. But the decision to make so large an increase retrospective has caused some surprise. It is attributable partly to the exigencies of the present international situation, and partly to the abnormally heavy ordering which has been experi- enced from the United States within the past fortnight. NO MEETING HELD The manner of reaching the decision is a reflection of the crisis. As arranged in June the next meeting of the Committee was to have been held in Brussels on 21st September. An earlier meeting proving impossible in present circumstances it was presum- ably decided to make the quota change by telegraph. This is permitted under Article 8 (c) of the 1937 Control scheme which provides: \" If no dele- gation entitled to vote opposes, de- cisions of the Committee can be taken, without a meeting, by correspondence between the Chairman and all delega- tions entitled to vote.\" Publication of the monthly statistics for August has been delayed owing to the difficulties of telegraphic communi- cation from the Straits. STOCKS DECLINING According to one London authority a total decline in stocks amounting to 3,000 tons is estimated to have occurred last month. This figure is arrived at after taking into account the visible supplies together with the carry-over in the Straits and at Euro- pean smelters. Previous improvements in the statistical position may be illustrated by the fact that total stocks (includ- ing smelter stocks on the revised basis) have fallen from over 50,000 tons in March to 39,500 tons at the end of July. American deliveries last month reached the high total of 6,295 tons, compared with 5,275 tons in July and 3,708 tons in August, 1938. Last month's total was higher than that in any month since 1937, when the average monthly deliveries totalled 7,222 tons. There were no dealings in tin yesterday, the London Metal Ex- change being closed. For many weeks the cash price has been under the control of the Buffer Pool, sales being made by that body at Â£230 a ton.",

   "text_content" : "The investing public has been pre- pared for the worst. Hopes ran high in some quarters that the eleventh hour would bring peace and concord. Early in the week a slight relaxation of the political tension was noticed and until Thursday, when the decision to close the Stock Exchange was announced, markets in terms of sentiment and prices were distinctly cheerful. The general rise in values was attributed more to sentiment than to expansion in business, but a small demand there was, since the prevailing hopes of peace caused professional operators on the bear tack to cover their commitments and these purchases proved a source of strength in a flagging market. The Big Chain Stores While there may be less inclination among the public to spend money other than on necessaries, holders of shares such as those of Woolworth and Marks and Spencers should have little to worry about in coming months. Experience, if it counts for anything, has shown that in times of stress the popular domestic stores stand to do well from the very nature of their business. Woolworth has 754 retail stores throughout the Kingdom from Storno- way in the north to Jersey in the south, so that its profit-earning assets are so well-spread that the risk of war damage is comparatively small. Marks and Spencer has 234 stores spread through- out the country. So far as this financial year has gone the earnings of both undertakings are understood to have been very satis- factory. For 1938 Woolworth earned 87J per cent. and distributed 65 per cent., against 60 per cent., so that the maintenance of the higher rate is a reasonable assumption at the moment. On this basis the 5s Ordinary shares at 63s offer a yield of Â£5 3s per cent. Should the dividend be raised to 70 per cent. the potential yield would be Â£5 11s per cent. Last year Marks and Spencer re- turned earnings equal to 74J per cent. In conformity with the policy of extend- ing the business out of earnings the cash dividend was limited to 422 per cent. again, augmented by a capital bonus of 10 per cent. The 5s \"A\" shares around 55s looked uncommonly attractive. A few weeks ago they were quoted 60s 6d. Bushtick Outside New Gold Tax Kaffirs, which during the week had advanced on the rise in the price of gold-the metal being 161s an ounce on Monday last-receded on the announcement that the Union Govern- ment proposes to seek authority to appropriate all gold-mining profits above a price of 150s an ounce for the metal. Already the majority of South African gold-producing companies bear a heavy burden for taxation. This brings out the point that there are certain other mines operating out- side the Union which have not the disadvantages of heavy taxation. An instance is that of Bushtick, whose property is in Rhodesia. The company has made very good progress during the financial year ended 30th June, as indicated in the quarterly reports. Working profit for the June quarter was Â£22,196, or just over double that for the like period of 1938. Total earnings for the twelve months amount to Â£61,605, or about 12 per cent. on the capital. Actually, the June quarterly figures showed earnings equal to 18 per cent. Profits expanded in July. Coming Dividend Estimate Incidentally, in the last quarterly return of Bushtick Mines the gold was valued at 147s, which is under current price. The earnings were secured on the yield of under 3 dwts, whereas the developments show an average value of 5.2 dwts, and indications pointto the company being able later on to treat richer ores. The market is looking forward to a final dividend this month and is going for 5 per cent., which with the in- terim would make 74 per cent. for the year. The 10s shares changed hands this week at 7s 6d, thus offering a prospective yield of 10 per cent. Amalgamated Metal It is early yet to learn how Amal- gamated Metal Corporation is affected by the situation on the Continent. It is a holding company, controlling British Metal Corporation, and has large shareholdings in Imperial Smelt- Eng, among other interests, and a working agreement with a German metal group. In the last combined balance-sheet of the two operating :ompanies, the German shareholdings, :onverted at 11.57 marks, were valued it Â£961,000, and the directors' valua- ;ion of these and other investments vas Â£2,690,000. In addition, stock of :ommodities at the end of 1938 was re- ;urned at Â£3,009,865. In relation to ;he balance-sheet total of Â£6,641,586, ;he amount represented by the German nvestments was not large. The corporation is interested in tin, ,opper, lead and zinc, and carries on mportant trading in rubber through ts subsidiary, Henry Gardner and Co. 3Sritat",

   "article_dc_title" : "Sharp Recovery after Early Selling",
   "text_content" : "INDUSTRIAL INDEX ENDS 0.84 UP AT 135.25 RAILS AND UTILITIES FINISH LOWER From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 1st Sept. The Stock Market fell heavily in the first hour, but a rally followed reports that Italy was refraining from military operations. In the late deal- ings Industrials moved sharply up- wards, particularly the so-called \" war \" stocks. The general close was irregular. The Dow-Jones average closing price for Industrials advanced 0.84 to 135.25, but the Rails index lost 0.17 at 25.93 and the Utilities average 0.95 at 23.59. Turnover jumped to 1,970,000 shares from only 460,000 yesterday. Of 864 stocks dealt in, 488 declined, 259 rose and 117 were unchanged. Mr. George L. Harrison, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said he had \"never seen the New York financial community work together better.\" He meant the reasonably good opening of the market in the circum- stances and the subsequent developments, indicating that the recently devised anti- shock machinery was working. U.S. SUPPORTS ITS BONDS Unlike the market's usual action on unusual news, leading stocks, instead of not opening until 10.15 or 10.30 a.m. or later pending the closing of the gaps between the bid and asked prices, appeared on the tape in the first five minutes. There were indications that the initial selling did not come from insurance companies and other institutions. Foreign bonds opened demoralised, with losses of fractions to 3 points or more, and the weakness continued. Early bids for domestic Corporate bonds were withdrawn following declines of fractions to a point and over. Over-the-counter traders in U.S. Government bonds withdrew from -k ht e mar et because of F e support, with the result that declines were limited to only % or less. The governors. of the Federal Reserve Board held a meeting and took steps to provide an orderly market in U.S. Govern- ment bonds, including preparations to make advances to Federal Reserve member and non-member banks on U.S. Government bonds at par. This will obviate any need for banks to sell Govern- ment securities to raise cash. The Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Delano, said that the national banks were in the strongest condition in their history and able to withstand any conceivable shock. EXCHANGES MAY NOT SHUT The spokesman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said that the New York Stock Exchange will open' and stay open in spite of a European war, barring unforeseen developments. Mr. Marriner S. Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said after a con- ference with President Roosevelt that no change was contemplated in margin re- quirements in the event of a European war. \"It is a cash market anyway,' he added. Mr. Jesse Jones, Federal Loan Adminis- trator, said after a conference with President Roosevelt that there would be no lack of credit for American enterprise in the event of war, and that the Recon- struction Finance Corporation had plenty of unused credit. Neither the R.F.C. nor the Export-Import Bank were subject to the Johnson Act, he added, and the export of commodities to European countries could be financed through R.F.C. and Export-Import Bank credits. EXCESS BANK RESERVES Excess reserves of Federal Reserve member banks over legal requirements increased $60,000,000 in the week to 30th August to $4,800 millions. U.S. gold stocks rose $137,000,000 to the new high record of $16,638 millions. Gold ear marked for foreign account at end-August totalled $1,135 millions, against $1,300 millions at end-July. At a meeting early to-day of the newly- formed Foreign Exchange Committee it was decided to do nothing on this point for the present, and that it was better to take no action until the foreign exchange mrarket'had had a chance to settle down. RISING RAIL LOADINGS Railroad freight loadings for the week to 26th August totalled 688,600 cars-a new peak for the year. It represents an increase of 14,400 on the week and of 68,100 on the corresponding week of last year. Motor-car production this week is estimated by Ward's at 25,240 units, compared with 17,465 units last week. It is estimated that dividend and inte- reLt payments in September will aggre- gate $523,900,000, compared with $254,700,000 in August. Transactions in stocks in August totalled 17,372,000 shares, compared with 18,066,000 in July. Dealings in bonds in August amounted to a par value of $111,420,000, against $119,480,000 in July. BROKERS' LOANS DOWN Loans to brokers and dealers in securities in the week to 30th August were $22,000,000 lower on the week at $467,000,000. Other loans for purchasing or carrying securities were unchanged at $183,000,000. The New York Board of Estimate has ratified the City's agreement to purchase all the properties of the Interborough Rapid Transit and Manhattan Railway (tho elevated lines) for $151,248,187.

   "text_content" : "NEW YORK, 1st Sept. The opening of Wall Street was easy in the extreme and business was moderately active, but trading was quite orderly, with no large transactions appearing. During the morning a broad decline of fractions was registered, with the Steel and Utility groups particularly heavy. Stocks con- tinued to come into the market until mid- day, when a long list was 1 to 2 points down. Sugar shares soared 1 to 4 points quite early in the session, and elsewhere nervous selling quickly dried up, the market there after turning quiet at 1 to 3 points lower. Towards midday an active rally from the previous low levels took place following a report that Italy was refraining from military initiative, with the Steel, Copper and Motor divisions showing considerable strength on the recovery. Industrial, Chemical and Merchandising issues were the hardest hit. Steels were heavy in tone, but Aircrafts displayed re sistance. Copper stocks were supported in response to an active inquiry for the com- modity. Active buying took place in the later operations, when the \"ticker\" lagged slightly behind transactions, and most of the list in consequence was lifted anything to $2 above its previous low levels. Steels finished on a cheerful note, with the so- called \" war babies \" $1 to $4 higher. The. close was irregular. Moody's commodity index price (31st December, 1931=100) was to-day 146.9, against 140,3 yesterday. On the Bond market U.S. Government and Railroad issues were very weak. Sterling opened 12c down at $4.20, improved to $4.25 (paid) later in the session, then progressively declined to $4.23 and $4.21%, but finally advanced arid closed 7c lower at $4.25 (bid). Silver was unchanged at 35%c.",

We do not recommend brokers or dealers, nor do we initiate speculation, but advise the public to deal throiokh members ol the London or Provincial Stock gEchanoes. A charge is made of 10s for replies by prepaid teleorams or for a reply by letter. Correspondents kindly note that this opfer does not apply to our contributor \" AutolycUs \" or \" The Diarist. All inquiries addressed to the Editor must bear the writer's name and lull address. Postal address: 72. Coleman-street. E.C.2. Teleurans : \" Finantimo. Are.. London.\" Arrow-These bonds are not dealt in on any Stock Exchange in this country, but presum- ably they would come within the scope of the new regulation. Your bank would regis- tei them for you. C. B.-The only fund possessed by the concern is that provided by the premiums received and it may or may not prove adequate. Everything will depend upon the amount of claims. Doubt-So far only Canadian Northern Pacific Four and a-Half per Cent. Terminal debentures may be deemed to come within the regulation. The other securities in time may be put upon the list. G. C.-It is not necessary to register every- thing. Where dividends are payable here in sterling it is not necessary to register. There would be no object in registering \" worthless \" securities. In the circumstances you should accept cash in lieu of the deben- tures offered. Scotus-It does not follow that because a company has large reserves that they will be capitalised and distributed in the form of a bonus. Many company directors are averse to such a step. Marks and Spencer is likely to continue the distribution of scrip bonuses for a time. Among concerns with large reserves in relation to Ordinary capital include William Cory, British Insulated Cables, Manbre and Garton and United Molasses. S. E. S., Nottinghanl-Current conditions do not lend themselves to the discussion of capital possibilities in your list of shares. It is a satisfactory list and, with the restoration of normal conditions, prices should improve. T. B.-1. So far the Treasury has not dis- closed its plans and any suggestions at this stage might prove misleading. 2. A review of \"The Mobilisation of Foreign Investments in 1915-18\" was given ill our issue of 30th August at some length. We refer you to it. Watch-Under the new Act for the regula- tion of dealers in stocks and shares that class of business is prohibited. In future you will have to do the business in the normal way through the Stock Exchange. W. H. E.-Doubts exist whether Mexican Eagles come within the regulation and deal- ings have not ceased in the shares. The list in which they appear is not an official one but one in which the securities mentioned \"may be deemed\" to come within the ban. You might wait for a definite ruling. W. R. H.-As we pointed out before, there is no recognised ratio of such loans and de- posits to capital in company practice. If you have good security and the percentage of bad debts is likely to be small you can expand to whatever length you can afford to accept the risk.

   "text_content" : "Germany has chosen war rather than negotiation, and staked her all on attacking Poland. Fully aware that the forces of France and Britain, backed by the good will and material assistance of other nations, would be thrown immediately into the scale against him, Herr Hitler has committed the German people to this suicidal course. Had his regime, relentlessly spurred on by Nazi doctrine, been content to further its cause by peaceful means Germany to-day would have been a stronger, wealthier and happier unit in the international economic structure. As it is, the outward panoply in which she goes to war barely con- ceals a wracked, distended and ill- supplied economy, the worst possible background for schemes of con- quest. On Herr Hitler lies the responsi- bility for pitch-forking Europe, with all its obvious potentialities for peaceful and constructive com- mercial development, into the destructive horrors of a major war. The conflict will be shortened so far as lies in the power of this country to resist and destroy its instigators and re-establish peace and reason to the world. Great Britain stands powerful and united to that end in all its great resources of man-power and wealth.",

   "text_content" : "It was just as well that the Stock Exchange was closed yesterday. The effect of that step was to shut off business completely so fa- as London was concerned. No more than one or two tentative inquiries from the provinces were reported by brokers. Many visits made by representatives of THE FINANCIAL TIMES served only to show that a big proportion of mnem- bers were taking full advantage of being absolved from the obligation to keep their offices open. In cases where members or clerks had struggled through, they found no more than a minimum of routine business to occupy their attention. If the Stock Exchange was out of action, so far as dealing was concerned, its officials were still seeking adjustments appropriate to the changed conditions. Not much emerged for publication, but a modi- fication of the requirements in regard to the delivery of \"controlled\" stocks in certain circumstances is welcome a. saving a certain amount of trouble. It will allow the name of the buyer instead of that of the seller to be registered at the Bank of England in the cases concerned if registration takes place within a month of the control Order. Even relatively minor points of that kind make a consider- able difference to work just now, but as far as the more recondite implica- tions of current developments are con- cerned, we are altogether too close to the most deplorable aspects of the situation to give much heed to them. The commentator of the future, howd- ever, will have abundant material to analyse, and one of his main objec- tives is likely to be a comparison of conditions now with those of 1914. So far as can be seen, the advantage will be all in favour of 1939. Longer warning has been given this time of the possibility of crisis, it is true, but this would not have sufficed to bring preparations to their present stage of perfection but for the experience garnered during years of progress. In the monetary-sphere this goes far to account for the calmness apparent .yesterday. Foreign exchanges, with sterling dropping from 4.28J-4.19, showed very little activity, as was natural in the circumstances, and the market closed early. Money was no more than \"usable\" and bill rates were just a little firmer. This was largely attributable to intimation that no further advance in Bank Rate is considered probable, in itself a re- markable .contrast with the 1914, posi. tion, when it reached 10 per cent. The difference must be taken as implying every confidence that the arrange- ments made to meet an emergency are as complete as human knowledge can make them. We have advanced far it monetary matters in the last 25 years and this is an assurance that, both ai regards actual currency and in the care of the Money market, arrange. ments are likely to work veri smoothly. The essential mechazism is still functioning much as usual, ir Y r L 3 t t I t ] t c t 1 j 1 1 I spite of the extent to which decen- tralisation has been carried. This phase of the present disturbance, in fact, is likely to prove one of the most interesting for that future examina- tion of which mention was made just now. Its ultimate significance cannot yet be judged, but so far everything indicates that it will prove entitled to a verdict that it has worked wonder- fully well.",

   "text_content" : "Britain has already made vast sacri- fices for defence, the necessity of which has been fully proved by yester- day's developments on the Continent. Ultimate financial demands will be enhanced by the additional prepara- tions now forced upon us. The bill must be paid and the House of Com- mons lost no time last evening in authorising the expenditure of Â£500,000,000 for defence, for the main- tenance of public order and contin- gency for the effective prosecuticr of war. The granting of the credit is but the beginning of things. The point next to be determined is how the money is to be found. The first source of national revenue, of course, is taxa- tion, and, heavy as that is now, a threat of additions is implicit in the indication given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a second Budget this year is probable. They will be borne stoically for the sake of ensur- ing that out of the present turmoil will emerge an era of such peace as the world has not known since Ger- many adopted again the doctrine that might is right. Second to taxation comes borrow- ing. An operation in that class has been \"in the air\" for a long time-a medium or long-term loan, that is, as opposed to temporary accommoda- tion in the form of Treasury bills. The latter, however, are likely to be relied upon primarily for a little longer, and in fact the amount to be offered for tender next Friday has been raised further to Â£50,000,000 from the Â£40,000,000 made available yesterday. There is still room for considerable expansion of their total, so far as the banks and the discount market are concerned. No difficulty will be found in meeting current expenditure with their aid for time enough to give markets and investors a chance to adapt themselves to the changed conditions preparatory to the launching of a big Defence Loan which sooner or later will become essential. National savings have never stood higher than they do now. Those accumulated by the various forms of thrift generally followed by the small investor alone have risen by Â£1,200,000.000 since 1931 to Â£3,386,500,000. Owners in many cases have been reluctant to put capital to active use during uncer- tainty, but there is not the least doubt that the national need will prove as vigorous and effective a stimulus to investment (and the Government has already acknowledged the necessity for appealing to all classes) as it did a quarter of a century ago.",

   "text_content" : "The decline in net profit of East- woods by Â£22,700 at Â£37,200 for the year to end-March is not surprising in view of the recession in the building trade. It has been accompanied by a reduction in the final distribution on the Ordinary shares from 7g per cent. to 3, making 8 per cent. as compared with 121 per cent. On the basis of this distribution, the shares give a yield of just over 62 per cent. at the last quoted price bs 25s cum dividend. This is the second successive cut in the dividend from the previous peak rate of 15 per cent. paid between 1934 and 1937. Like all established producers of bricks, this company has experienced severe competition from newer entrants into the industry, a develop- ment which has been intensified since the falling off of building demand. The directors have given careful study to the problems of building de- velopment in this country and, as Mr. Horace Boot remarked at the last meeting, the Eastwoods group have turned their attention to the Midlands and North where they have sought through their merchanting organisa- tion to tap the benefits of delayed housing construction.",

Taxation provision chargeable against that total is much the same as last time at Â£6,600. The balance of profits com- fortably permits of the-Ordinary divi- dend being maintained at 12 per cent. for the year and entitles the holders of the Five per Cent.

Surplus profits of Â£5,000 are reserved. Stocks show a healthy reduction from the record figure of Â£92,000 to Â£64,600, and although debtors are sub- stantially lower, creditor balances, in- cluding bank loans, have also been re- duced.

   "text_content" : "Confirmation of the improved re- sults of Chambers Wharf and Cold Storage indicated in the preliminary statement is provided by the full report. Before allowing for taxation, the net profits amount to Â£42,800, as compared with Â£84,600 for the pre- vious period of 18 months. A hint of this improvement was given by the increase of 2 per cent. in the interim dividend. The final of 13 per cent. and bonus of 5 per cent. bring the total distribution for the year up to 30 per cent., an increase of 5 per cent. Taxation absorbs the larger sum of Â£8,300, and Â£5,000, or double last year's allocation, is transferred to general reserve, These results are satisfactory and justify the reconstructions and ex- tensions carried out during the past two years. The company's Thames- side warehouse and cold stores now provide improved storage and hand- ling facilities for various kinds of produce and goods. Last December steps were taken to increase the authorised capital by Â£200,000 Ordi- nary shares to Â£700,000 in order to prepare the ground for an issue if required to finance a possible further expansion of storage facilities. So far an issue of shares has not proved necessary. On Thursday the 5s Ordi- nary shares were quoted at 30s and at that level they yield 5 per cent. on the basis of a 30 per cent. dividend.",

   "text_content" : "An increase in the profits of Whit- worth and Mitchell, the textile manu- facturers, last year points to strenuous effort in the face of disappointing con- ditions. Net profit is Â£14,600 more at Â£35,900, after charging Â£6,300 against Â£8,000 for taxation. Earnings this time are thus amply sufficient to cover the Preference dividend, which was short earned last time, and to enable the company to pay 1Ã½ per cent. on the Ordinary, against nothing a year ago. Like other textile concerns the com- pany suffered during the year from the uneasiness caused by the inter- national situation, especially during the latter part of 1938. The effect was to cause buyers to adopt a hand- to-mouth policy, resulting in a severe contraction of orders, while deliveries of goods on order were also delayed. In spite of these difficulties the com- pany did well with its cotton depart- ments, but the rayon section, which is an important branch of the business, passed through a critical time, owing to excessive stocks and unremunera- tive prices. Trading items in the balance-sheet indicate the smaller turnover by lower figures, but the liquid position has been well main- tained, and the company has Â£200,000 in outside investments and Â£124,600 in cash. The immediate outlook, de- scribed by the Chairman as hopeful, subject to the international situation, is necessarily affected by the latest serious developments. The latest quotation for the Â£1 shares was 8s 3d.",

   "text_content" : "Interim dividends declared by the United Tobacco Companies (South) and British Tobacco Company (Aus- tralia) may be taken to indicate that earnings of these substantial con- cerns in the two Dominions have been well maintained. The dividend of 6d per share by United Tobacco (South), operating in South Africa, compares with 9d per share a year ago. Allow- ance has to be made for the fact that in the meantime capital has been increased by Â£300,000 to Â£2,700,000 owing to the scrip bonus of 121 per cent. distributed in March. The divi- dend now declared is the fourth in the current year. Payments of 34 per cent. and 5 per cent. were made on the old capital in Â£1 shares before the scrip bonus, and 5 per cent. on the shares in their new form of 10s in June. For the whole of the previous year dividends of 25 per cent. and a cash bonus of 15 per cent. made up 40 per cent., which has been paid for three years in succession. All dividends are paid free of South African income- tax. The current price is 85s for the Ordinary and Deferred Ordinary. The distribution of 2 per cent. now an- nounced by the British Tobacco Com- pany (Australia) makes the fourth at this rate for the year, and is the same as a year ago. The company then paid for the whole period a total of 10 per cent., including a final of 2 per cent. The rate of exchange to be de- ducted will be announced at the end of the month. The last quotation for the Â£1 shares is 35s.",

This has warranted the repetition of 121 per cent., tax free, on the Ordinary and Five per Cent. Cumulative Participating Preference, of which .5 per cent. was paid as an in- terim. The Â£1 Ordinary are quoted at 42s ex rights, at which the yield is nearly 61 per cent. The capital was increased last May by the issue of 133,850 Ordinary shares, though they do not rank for the divi- dend just announced. The company has made steady pro- gress since 1934 and the recession of 1938-39 represents the first halt since then in the advance. Income is de- rived first from collieries, which may have been expected again to have been protected from the worst of trade fluctuations by the stabilisation of selling prices. The second main source of revenue-namely, the iron- works-is likely to have benefited by industrial demand as well as by the effect of rearmament.",

   "text_content" : "In order to be readily available to take any urgent steps considered necessary, the Stock Exchange emer- gency sub-committee and other members of the full Committee were present at the House all day. The Committee's staff and the waiters were on duty. No official announcement was issued, but it is understood that the Committee still hoped that the House would reopen on Monday. The Committee's staff was engaged in compiling a list of addresses and telephone numbers outside the City to which communications from the Com- mittee can be made to members and firms. Communications so addressed will constitute a sufficient notice to the member or firm. STANDING-BY Committee and staff will be at the office again to-day and to-morrow in order to be prepared for any urgent action considered necessary. London offices of members of the New York Stock Exchange remained open as usual yesterday. In view of the exceptional circumstances prevail- ing, business was almost impossible. British nationals are forbidden to sell American stocks without Treasury permission, and although there is as yet no ban on the purchase of Ameri- can stocks, the public naturally showed litle inclination to make such purchases. Owing to the congestion of the cable service, the quotations syndicate found it extremely difficult to obtain American quotations and the number of messages received was consider- ably reduced. American brokers intend to remain open in London as long as the Stock Exchange remains open in New York. In some cases a removal to a tempo- rary address is contemplated and it is expected that personnel will be reduced. Although Stock Exchange members were informed that there was no obligation to attend their offices yester- day in view of the closure of the House a number of brokers did make an appearance. Members of staff also attended in a number of instances. In- quiries by THE FINANCIAL TIMES failed to find that any jobbers had opened their offices. No trace could be found of any busi- ness having been transacted. One broker received an inquiry from a Bristol client for a small line of shares, but was unable to effect the order in the absence of jobbers. Those members and staff who were at their offices devoted their time to dealing with routine matters left over on Thursday night, such as the sending out of transfers and certificates. REGISTRATION RULING Testimony to the absence of the majority of members and staff was to be found in the fact that there was only one inquirer at the offices of the Committee. The Inland Revenue's Stamp Office in Austin Friars, which is almost ex- clusively used by Stock Exchange firms, experienced an exceedingly quiet time. Under a dozen transac- tions were effected during the morn- ing and the office was closed shortly after lunch owing to the absence of business. The Share and Loan Department sta w a ais _1 L u- i -n in -1--X _- 1* ^T--lL. f fats was also on dut r- noon the following announcement was made available in connection with the Defence (Finance) Regulations which prohibit owners of certain foreign securities from selling their hold- ings:- DEFENCE (FINANCE) REGULATIONS In the case of transactions entered into after 26th August Securities to which the order relates are only good delivery if accompanied by the rela- tive Registration Certificate stamped by the Bank of England. Should a deliverer not have been registered at the Bank of England by the lodgment of Forms S.1. A. & B., it may be convenient (in order to be relieved of the necessity first to register the seller's name and then to apply for transfer by means of Form S.2. into the buyer's name) to effect this registration direct into the name of the buyer provided this takes place before the expiration of one month from the date of the Order. The buying broker should pass the name and address of his client to the deliverer in the ordinary way. The deliverer on receipt of the ticket should get into touch with the issuer of the ticket and inform him that lie has received his ticket for X number of shares (the ticket may have been split) and ask him to fill in on Forms S.1. A. and B. the name and address of the buyer and other par- ticulars asked for except for the definitive numbers of Bonds or Certi- ficates (which would only be known to the deliverer). Having done this the issuer of the ticket should then return these forms S.1. A. and B. to the deliverer who should fill in on Form S.1. B. the defi- nitive numbers of the Bonds or Certi- ficates, put his stamp in the place -provided on Form S.1. B. and lodge the Forms S.1. A. and B. with the Share and Loan Department, for transmission to the Bank of England. The registration certificate Form S.1. B. will be returned to the deliverer through the Share and Loan Depart- ment, which will enable him to deliver the security to the issuer of the ticket. As the Stock Exchange was closed yesterday the above notice could not be brought to members' attention by the usual method of posting in the House. It was therefore decided to post the notice to the private addresses of members. REVISED LIST A number of inquiries were made at the Share and Loan Department regarding the considered securities likely to come under the Defence (Finance) Regulations. Inquirers were referred to the list of securities deemed likely to come under the regu- lations which was published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Thursday and to the revisions in yesterday's issue. The revised list will be published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Monday. This is an unofficial compilation drawn up by jobbers for the guidance of holders, brokers, bankers and others. The list is expected to be further revised shortly. Further \"ex dividend\" minimum prices for stocks quoted in the gilt- edged market, in addition to those recorded in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, were available, and are as follow:- Brighton 3 per cent., 1955-58 84g Kent 31 per cent., 1968 ...... 941 Canada 4 per cent. Regis- tered, 1940-60 .............. 98 Queensland 5 per cent., 1940-60 ........................ 94J The new minima have been incor- porated in the usual Stock Exchange price tables on Page Two."

   "text_content" : "OME of the several stockbrokers who attended their offices yester- day morning were comparing the present state of markets with the conditions obtaining at the similar time in 1914. As memories were jogged by the course of the discussion it became in- creasingly clear how much better able to face whatever is before it the Stock Exchange is now than it was then. The Stock Exchange was closed on 27th July, 1914, it was recalled, when markets were experiencing a hectic boom. Open contangoes ran into many millions of pounds-twenty millions, one broker suggested, would be a low estimate. In some stocks-Foreign Railways were among those mentioned-posi- tions of fully a million pounds were being carried by individual jobbers. Minima Formulation of a scheme to settle these accounts took a long time and their liquidation was spread over years. The Stock Exchange was not reopened for business until 4th January, 1915, but, meanwhile, deal- ings had been taking place on a fair scale between offices and the Throg- morton Street district had been by no means inactive. The 1914 list of minimum prices \"covered a wider range than does that now in force. It was not drawn up until after the outbreak of war-on 14th September, 1914-and it stood until 29th January,, 1916. Even then only certain securities were released from minima, others coming off the list on 11th March, 15th May and 3rd July of the same year. In contrast to the open position of many millions in 1914 the amount of stock now being carried over is in- Alnitesimal. One broker put it yester- day at a quarter of a million; another regarded that figure as a considerable exaggeration. By Telephone If the time comes for the Stock Exchange to move to Denham the tele- phone will become, as in 1914, the medium for much of the business done. Making a price in ignorance of what other dealers may be quoting is no jobber's idea of a picnic; but the adapt- ability for which the Stoqk Exchange is noted should not be long in creating a market of reasonable freedom. . The necessity for dealing by tele- phone does not present any difficulty in itself-the foreign exchange market shows that-but it would probably take time to get an efficient system into operation. Foreign exchange business is done entirely by telephone. Brokers and the banks are linked by private wires so that by pressing a button a broker is in immediate communication with any bank, or vice versa. As a result trans- actions are put through even more rapidly than is possible under normal Stock Exchange procedure. Joint Books It would clearly, be impossible for Stock Exchange brokers and dealers to be linked so efficiently, especially if they were working from their private addresses scattered over a wide area; but only a little co-operation should be necessary to make some sort of a chain by which the public could be served. A jobber with whom I discussed the matter yesterday suggested that if he and a few other jobbers dealing in the same stocks opened an office at the same address and agreed to work a joint book they should be able to guarantee a reasonably good market. This might ultimately prove to be a more practicable scheme than having a \"floor\" for dealings at Denham to which many members might find it impossible to travel. Goat and Compasses A RAY of cheer that came into the office yesterday was a small booklet written and gaily illustrated by Sir Gurney Benham on the history and meaning of inn signs. Sir Gurney dispels a number of popular misconceptions. The \"Goat and Compasses\" is not, he tells us, a corruption of \"God encompasses us.\" It was a sign to attract thirsty shoe- makers and builders. The arms of the Company of Cord- wainers--hoemakers-.-included three goats -heads,:,while that of the'Car- penters, or builders, Company contained three compasses. The \" Elephant and Castle \" has been said to derive from the Infanta of Castille. Sir Gurney tells us that it was merely taken from the arms of the Cut- lers Company, who adopted it possibly because they wanted to pass off as Ivory the bone they used in knife-handles. * * f\\ i-. -_ '-' O userver ~~~:i I",

The Joint War Risk Rating Com- mittde'also decided that:on and after to-day all business accepted and de- clarations made under war risk con- tracts, other than those within the scope of the \"Pool \" schedule, would be increased by 50 per cent. of the \"homeward rate.\" This means that where the outward and homeward rates are the same the increase will be one of 50 per cent. on both. But where there is a higher homeward rate than that for the out- ward voyage the rate for both outward and homeward voyages will be an in- crease of 50 per cent. on the current homeward rate. Although the increase is announced to take effect from 2nd September inclusive, the fact that Lloyd's and the companies will be closed to-day makes the effective date of the change Monday, 4th Sep- tember. TO CARRY ON As for the future, so far as is known at present, Lloyd's will carry on in the City until further notice. But it is under- stood that at the outbreak of war the Underwriting Room would be removed to accommodation already prepared in the lower basement of Lloyd's Building which is, in fact, part of the air raid shelter accommodation of Lloyd's and Royal Mail House. Brokers and underwriters will carry on with skeleton staffs, the signing bureau and other clerical departments being transferred to premises already acquired in the country. In some cases one under- writer will act for several syndicates and some of the marine companies have agreed to form groups for which one underwriter will accept business and a joint policy will be issued. The business of insurance and particu- larly of marine insurance must go on. There is every reason to believe that the arrangements made by the authorities will prove adequate to any emergency that may arise.",

Communication with Con- tinental centres was impossible by 'phone and banks resorted to telegrams. Business was carried on in certain cur- rencies in face of all the difficulties and, under the circumstances, sterling put up a stout show. Dollars, American and Canadian, were in demd a and there was a sus- picion of control operations in the former. In both instances rates closed 10 cents against sterling. Among Continentals, French and Swiss francs could be dealt in and the former, which were controlled by the authorities, were actually cheaper on balance. Turnover was only modest. At 4 p.m. intimation was given by tha Committee of the Ldodon Foreign Exchange market that business should be suspended for the day. This action was taken as a matter of convenience. Unless a banking holiday a o a mora- torium is declared, the foreign ex- change market will function to-day as normally as possible. Discussing possibilities last night. exchange market authorities appeared convinced that if this country moves into a state of war, sterling will be pegged and there will be no open market. It is expected that the British Government will be given a free hand in fixing the levdl of the sterling-dollar rate, but opinion was divided as to whether that level will be above or below that now ruling. The country in general and the City in particular is carrying on and will carry on with traditional calm; there will be nothing in the nature of cur- rency difficulties and the nation can rest assured that the authorities have plans formulated to meet every con- tingency. The Bill Tender The complete absence of alarm was exemplified by the result of yesterday's tender for 4i0,000,000 of Teereasur bills. With the outlook as it is, a rise in the rate of discount would not have been surprising. As it was, the average was almost identical with that of the previous week. It is understood that a certain amount of guidance was given to the market, the intimation being that no further upward change in Bank Rate is at present contemplated and that, if necessary, there will be an outlet for bills through the special buyer next week. Applications we r relatively smaller as a larger volume of bills was avail- able, so that the market syndicate obtained a better percentage quota. Next week's offer of Â£50,000,000 is Â£5,000,000 in excess of corresponding maturities, and in view of ever-increas- ing expenditure now inevitable it is expected that weekly tender issues will expand more and more. Gold Holdings The extensive dishoarding of gold which has been experienced since the crisis became acute has been caused partly by fear that the British Govern- ment may sequestrate stocks of the metal in the event of war, and partly because of recognition of the fact that if hostilities break out gold will not be easy to move. With regard to the first fact it,can be stated on responsible authority that foreigners have not the slightest cause for anxiety regarding their gold holdings. They will'be at liberty to retain them or dispose of them freely whichever they choose. So far as British nationals are concerned (they are by existing law limited to the hold- ingp of 10,000 per person), they may, and no doubt will, be called upon to surrender bars and/or coin against the current market price. Trading interests will be free to acquire the metal as they need it. Incidentally, the movement of gold ex-hoard lately cannot challenge comparison with the operations of September last year. mainly because open positions have been reduced a nd forward dealings banned. Polish Exchange The Council of the Bank of Poland has been authorised by the Finance Minister to increase note issue ad- vances and'Treasury bill purchases over and above present statutory limits. The necessary legislation will be promoted by the Bank after ap- proval of the modifications of the statutes by the general meeting of the shareholders. The Polish Finance Minister has issued a decree forbidding the im- portation of zloty notes from foreign countries. The object ot this step is the avoid- ance of manoeuvres detrimental to the Polish credit. The Foreign Exchange Commission has been authorised to Be.tle the monetary problems affecting Poland and Danzig. EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

Chief movements were a further decline in the value of the pound and a jump in wheat and cotton prices. Important decisions were taken by the Government following the German invasion of Poland. CREDIT BILL THROUGH COMMONS In the House of Commons a resolution for a credit of Â£500,000,000 for defence and possible war purposes was approved without a division, and the Bill passed through all its stages. A measure was also passed empowering the Government to use the Exchange Equalisation Fund for war purchases. The Chancellor of the Exchequer hinted that the intro- duction of a new Budget to make further financial provision might be necessary, although he could not say when this would take place. All the main line railways were placed under Government control and a Railway Executive Committee, under the chairman- ship of Sir Ralph Wedgwood, was appointed to act as agent of the Minister of Transport. The other members of the Committee are Sir James Milne, Mr. C. H. Newton, Mr. Frank Pick, Mr. Gilbert S. Szlumper and Sir William V. Wood. WALL STREET'S SHARP RALLY Wall Street stocks rallied sharply after heavy initial selling, turnover reaching 2,000,000 shares. (See. Page Three.) The tin quota for the second half of this year was raised by 15 per cent. from 45 per cent. to 60 per cent. of standard tonnages. (Details Page One.) PREMIER'S WARNING TO GERMANY The Prime Minister, in the House of Commons, Â§aid he feared he might not lfe able to avoid the responsibility of asking the country to accept the arbitrament of war. He announced that the British Ambassador in Berlin had been instructed to say that Britain and France would fulfil their obligations to Poland unless assurances were given that Germany suspended aggressive action and withdrew her forces from that country. If the reply to this last warning was unsatisfactory the Ambassador would ask for his passports. In such an event this country was ready. Complete mobilisation of the British Army, Navy and Air Force had been ordered and legislation would be brought in at once to organise the man-power of the nation on the most equitable and economic basis possible. Sir Nevile Henderson, British Ambassador in Berlin, handed to Herr von Ribbentrop last night the communication referred to in the Prime Minister's speech. The German Foreign Minister said that he would have to refer it to Herr Hitler.",

   "text_content" : "SIR JOHN SIMON, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in moving in the House of Commons last night a resolution for a credit of Â£500,000,000, said it would be used towards defraying expenses that might be incurred during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for ensuring the public safety and defence of the Realm, the maintenance of public order and the efficient prosecution of any war in which the Government might be engaged and for maintaining supplies to the services essential to the life of the community. NEW BUDGET LIKELY Chancellor's Hint On report of the resolution the Con- solidated Fund Bill would be brought in immediately to authorise this sum from the Consolidated Fund.' A fund of credit was necessary in wide and general terms and the scope of the fund was intended to cover expenditure involved in prosecuting any. war in which this country might be engaged. he figue of 500 millions had been arrived at after consideration as to the eventual outlay. Asked if within the course of a very few days he was going to introduce a new Budget, the Chancellor replied that the arrangements now being made were neces- sary in the emergence of a sudden and serious situation. But, speaking without having had an opportunity of considering it from all its implications, it certainly did appear to him that further provision would need to be made along the lines referred to. He could not give a date. Speaking on the Consolidated Fund Appropriation Bill (No. 2), the Chan- cellor explained that Clause 2 gave tem- porary powers to enable the Government to borrow within the total amount which the House had already approved. If the borrowing was exercised by the issue of Treasury bills they must be paid off not later than 31st March, 1940. If the money was borrowed otherwise than by Treasury bills-as, for example, in the form of a temporary loan from the National Debt Commissioners-the money must be repaid not later than the end of the quarter in which it is borrowed. Interest had been limited to 5 per cent., but. that ought not to be taken as an indi- cation of the decision or judgment as to what the ruling rate would be in the larger circumstances. \"It has been thought best to retain this figure of 5 per cent. unchanged rather than to attempt each year to fix a figure which might be expected to be achieved in the actual rates which obtain over the year.\" he concluded. \" The figure is stated merely as a maximum. The contents of this clause are not the wide and general terms which could be taken as a guide to future financial policy. They are in the nature of temporary powers.\" The Bill was then read a second and third time. Moving the second reading of the Currency Defence Bill, Sir John Simon recalled that at the beginning of the last war it was necessary to set up an Ex- change Account, which was financed by a 'vote of credit. Now we had already an exchange account-the Exchange Equalisation Account-and the first clause provided that that should be used for the pecessary purchases which arose in war for the defence of the realm and for the efficient prosecution of any war. One section removed the limit of Â£550 millions set by legislation to the amount that might be issued to the Exchange Equalisation Account. Another section made adequate provision for the supplies of legal tender, including the use as currency of postal orders, as was done 25 years ago, but he thought there would be adequate supplies of ordinary currency. Another sub-section dealt with security of special war advances for defence. Arrangements had been made by the Bank of England to provide banks out of Government funds with currency to enable them to meet demands from customeis for currency. The Bill was read a second and a third time. EMERGENCY BILLS Price Control The House later passed emergency legislation including a measure providing for the control of importation, export and carriage coastwise of goods under which rigid control will be instituted in many cases of manufacture and price limits fired for the sale of a particular com- modity in this country. Other measures provided for the 'em- powering of local authorities to make habitable houses damaged by war and to provide for financing emergency repairs, and provisions for the repair of buildings and the reinstatement of plant and under- takings damaged by war. All these measures were approved by the House of Lprds and received the Royal Assent. Both Houses of Parliament will meet again to-day. Provisions of the Currency (Defence) Bill issued last night include the abolition of the limit to the aggregate amount which may be issued to the Exchange Equalisation Account out of the Consoli- dated Fund, and the empowering of the Treasury to direct that excess assets in sterling may be applied to paying off debt. Another provision is that principal of and interest on loans made by the Bank of England by arrangement withthe Govern- ment constitute a prior charge on the borrower's assets.

   "text_content" : "The absence of telephonic communi- cation with the Continent created difficulties for the London foreign ex- change market yesterday, but after the initial adjustment of the rate for sterling, the market carried on in a calm manner. Business was transacted in American and Canadian dollars and in French and Swiss francs, but several quotations were unobtainable. The London-New York rate, after declining to $4.15, finished at $4.19, a net movement of 10 cents against sterling. Swiss francs were in demand. On the other hand, the French franc was offered, and the Control is understood to have intervened; the rate finished % in favour of London at 175%. At 4 p.m. the market received intimation from the London Foreign Exchange Com- mittee to close down for the day, this action being merely a measure of con- venience. Unless a bank holiday is de- clared or any unforeseen development occurs, the market will function to-day. SMALL GOLD TURNOVER Turnover in the bullion market was reduced to modest dimensions, only 60 bars, valued at Â£193,000, changing hands. The price was fixed Is higher at 160s per fine ounce; it was at a theoretical discount of 5s 6d on the dollar parity, being fixed on a supply and demand basis. Silver prices responded to a little specu- lative and Indian buying, spot gaining 1'/bd at 19%d and forward delivery 1%d at 19%'d per ounce. The bullion market will be closed for business to-day. TREASURY BILL TENDER Evidence of the calm in the City was to be found in the tender for Treasury bills. There was apparently an indication that the Bank Rate would not be moved up- wards, and that the \"special\" buyer would be available next week if necessity arises. Although there were Â£10,000,000 more bills available - the offer was for Â£40,000,000 - applications were only Â£5.860,000 more at Â£56,265,000. The full amount was allotted at an average rate of discount of Â£3 14s 3.48d per cent., which compares with Â£3 14s 5.44d per cent, a week ago. The market syndicate obtained a quota of 59 per cent. of the bills allotted. Next week's offer of Â£50,000,000 will be Â£5,000,000 in- excess of corresponding maturities.

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Despite the crisis, plans for release by the International Rubber Regulation Com- mittee of additional supplies required in consequence of the Anglo-American barter agreement are going ahead as far as possible. Originally it had been intended to con- vene a meeting of the Committee during the first week of this month. No date was published, but it is believed that 7th September was provisionally fixed. In the event of delegates being unable to attend in person, arrangements will be made to reach the necessary quota decision by telegraph. There is little doubt that provision for the additional supply will be approved. Some 80,000 tons of rubber are involved in the exchange against 600,000 bales of United States cotton. This amount could be provided by a quota of 10 per cent. for six months. Contrary to the impression gained in some quarters, the British Government has not to await the decision of the Committee before purchasing rubber to be delivered under the barter agreement. The possi- bility is not excluded that small purchases may have already been made. STRAITS URGE RELEASE From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT SINGAPORE, 1st Sept. Owing to the shortage of spot rubber it is being suggested here that the Inter- national Rubber Regulation Committee should immediately permit producers to export from existing estate stocks against the allowance for the December quarter. Singapore dealers maintain that they are unable to contract for delivery in October in view of the uncertainty of shipping. Apart from this, there is no rubber available for immediate shipment owing to the lack of export rights.",

   "text_content" : "BANKS' UNDERTAKING From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT JOHANNESBURG, 1st Sept. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange was closed to-day. The decision to close was taken at a meeting of the Stock Exchange Com- mittee, at which the banks were repre- sented. It was stated that the latter would do nothing to add to the problems of brokers or clients. Where difficulties arose due to inability to dispose of shares, all the facts would be taken into consideration and a decision given on the merits of the case. The Union Government's proposal to appropriate the gold proceeds of the Rand mines above 150s per ounce is to be con- sidered by the South African Mine Workers' Union, which has called a meet- ing for Sunday. Owing to the restrictions on cabling in code details of the Rand mine returns for August are expected to be despatched from Johannesburg by mail, and conse- quently may not be available in London for some time. As reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Tuesday, revenue is being based on gold at 148s per ounce for the seventh successive month. It was decided to adhere to this figure despite the rise in the sterling price of gold during the closing days of the period as the bulk of the month's output has been sold at just above 148s per ounce. Any necessary adjust- ments in earnings would be published later in the quarterly reports.",
