   "text_content" : "BLACKPOOL, Sept 5. In a speech clearly designed for a worldwide audience as well a for his trades union listene the Prime Miniter told the Trades Union Congress here today that the Government had no intention of indulging in \"panic economic nationalism.\" The speech had a double purpose-to convince the foreign audience that the British Government was deter- mined to act responsibly, and not to be deterred by any union opposition; and, secondly, to try to convince trade unionists in this country that it was in their interests to behave as responsibly as the Government was doing. In his second purpose Mr. Wilson was largely success- ful with those delegates at Congress whom he was most anxious to impress. Left-wing delegates tended to dismiss the speech as containing \" nothing new,\" while those on the Right Wing were enthusiastic about it. But the men with an uncommitted attitude were cautiously favourable. As one trade union leader in the uncommitted camp put it, \"the speech was a bit school- masterly most of the time. But at the end it came to life.\" he thought the Prime Minister had been \"clever\" in the way he had appealed to an international audience over the heads of his listeners at Congress. Confidence Vote Safe Prophecy It now appears that Mr. Wilson originally asked for an invitation to address Cofgress because he, like many other observers of the trades union scene, then thought that the TUC was likely to revolt asaisst its General Council's decl- altn to'' acquiesce i# i the pay freeze. To-day it is safe to prophesy that Congress will give the General Council a vote of confidence in the economic debate on Wednesda,. But a fortnight ago Mr. Wilson ' main intention was to make it clear that, whatever British trade unions might think of the Government's economic policy, he would see that it was carried through. This explains one of the key .hrascs in his speech to-day: There will be no letting up in the severity of the Government's economic measures until we are paying our way and seen to be paying our way. And this means that the Government must govern.\" The Prime Minister arrived on the platform this afternoon to applause that was about as warm as that accorded earlier in the day to the Mayor of Blackpool. And even at the end of his speech it could not be said that the applause was particularly enthusiastic. Tribute to PM's Oratory But he did manage, during the course of his 40-minute address, to eorsuade the audience to listen to him in silence. The early part of his speech was interrupted occ- slonally by individual delegates shouting objections, But during the last ten minutes It was so obvious to all delegates that most of them wanted to give Mr. Wilson a fair hearing that the interrup- lions ceased, When he sat down there were certain delegations (notably the railwaymen. seamen and transort workers) which refused to follow Conference report Page a the lead of Right-wing delegates who wanted to start a standing ovation. About half the delegates did stand, while continuing to clap. But the applause could be described, at best, as warm. It says something for Mr. Wilson's powers as an orator that he managed to obtain a polite hearing from the delegates although, just before he arrived, a dispute broke out between the seamen's delegation and Lord Cooper, a member of the TUC General Council. This dispute might well have inflamed the feel- ings of delegates to such an extent that opponents of the Prime Minister could have given him a rough reception if he had not handled his speeh with care. S.amen make a 'coliplaint Lord Cooper's dispute with the seamen's leaders began when. Mr. Joe Kenny. one of the Left-wing leaders of the seamen's strike, went to the rostrum to complain about a passage in the General Council's report which said that the National Union of Seamen had made the TUC's job as conciliator a difficult one by its unreasonable demands. Lord Cooper, who Is general secretary of the General and Municipal Workers' Union, followed Mr. Kenny to the rostrum to tell the delegates bluntly that \"the NUS should pay tribute to the General Council for making it possible for a settlement (of the strike) to be reached, At no time when we consulted with the sea. men's union was there any Indica- tion that they had the capacity to understand what negotiation means.\" He was interrupted by shouts of \"shame\" and you're Insulting us\" from the seamen's delegation, And an angry dispute would prob- ably have developed if Mr. Joe O'Hagan, the TUC chairman, had not changed the debate to a different subject, With the delegates' passions aroused by this argument it was probably just as well that the Prime Minister began his address In a low key. He was more than half-way through the speech before he got to the kernel of his message for the trade unions. Thi was that restrictive practice in Indus' try must cease, and that \" restraint in incomes, ind Incomes polloy Continued on page 1 Editorial comment Page 10",

For the irst time aircraft from European countries are also on show together with British products. 11 FARNBOROUGH, Sept 5. Firm contracts worth over Â£20m. for British aircraft and equipment were announced at -. AI - QL- L-- Handley Page revealed that sales of at least 100 of its new HP-137 Jetstream twin-turbo-prop business airliner, worth Â£14m., were put in train with a contract appointing CSE Aviation, of Oxford, as the main distributor for this new aircraft for many parts of Europe. Africa and the Near East. ecutvely, this means tnat CSEj Aviation is guaranteeing to Handley Page sales of this number of air- craft, enabling the manufacturer to go ahead with quantity production. Following the sale earlier this year of 20 Jetstreams to the U.S., this contract consolidates Handley Page's efforts to market this private venture aircraft on the American pattern of distributorships rather than by direct manufacturer-to- customer negotiatidns. Major Exports CSE Aviation will distribute its 100 Jetstreams in the U.K. and through a chain of main agents throughout the territories men- tioned. It is anticipated that 75 to 80 per cent. of the aircraft will be exported. \"We are on the threshold of a revolution in business travel during the next decade,\" said Lord Waterpark. sales director of CSE Aviation. \" Our surveys indicate a big market for this attractive Jetstream aircraft in our distribu. tion territories.\" The total of 120 Jetstreams ordered to date means that this aircraft is now near its breakeven point of 125 alicraft, eight months before the maiden fight of the prototype which is set for next May. Ultimately the manufacturer expects to sell up to 500 of these aeroplanes, Concord Hopes Meanwhile, major new contracts for the Anglo-French Concord supersonic airliner are expected to be announced soon by United Air Line and Braniff International Airlines, both of the United States, The United order Is believed to be ftr six aeroplanes, while Braniff is expected to sign for two, while a third American airline, Northwest, is alJo showing considerable Continued on prge 9 ~~-1Â· .Â·Â· -Â· .

   "text_content" : "Equities made a good start to the new Account yesterday, extending the rally further by 2.7 to309.9. Since the turn of the market last Tuesday, the index has now added a sub- stantial 18.3 points. Small investment buying, a lack of selling, and some upward adjust- ment of selling limits, appeared to be the main influences in the rise. Thorn The feature of the day was the heavy turnover and sharp rise in ,Thorn on rumoured take-over talks. The shares came back in the afternoon after a denial by the company, but at 66s 9d the Ordin- ary still closed 4s 9d higher and the \"A\" were 3s 6d to the good at 56s 9d. The rumour appears to have been caused by the presence of the president of General Tele- phone and Electronics, who is a director of Thorn, at the meeting last Friday. Certainly if and when Sir Jules decides to sell out GT and E, hold- ing about a quarter of the votes, seems likely to have first refusal. But GT and E has also denied any bid intentions at the moment and with Thorn currently capitalised in the market at Â£85.8m. such a move would hardly cheer up the U.S. Treasury. Despite a net overdraft of Â£9.4m. and the hard times ahead of the TV industry, it is worth remembering that no one can force the chairman's hand. Berk Berk's half-year profits are not good. Sales have continued to rise from Â£7.25m. to Â£8.65m., but margins have more than halved from 6.8 to 3.2 per cent, leaving pre-tax profits of Â£276.000 against Â£494,000. Even this slightly under- states the true fall since nine months of Berk Spencer Acids are consolidated in the latest figures against only a dividend previously. Berk has had its problems in handfuls this year. Against a back- ground of less buoyant trading conditions, there has been the ship. ping strike. and iiitial losses of th new retail horticultpre venture. Profits on the sand and gravel side, moreoer,are droonpng further. Worst of all has been the drop in the price of mercury from Â£200 to Â£105 a flask-Berk is one of the larger U.K. importers-which has involved \"trading losses.\" Where does Berk go from here ? Both the effect of the strike and the retail losses will be smaller in the second half. while the price of mercury is now up to Â£155 a flask. Thus Berk might get close to last year's 495.000 pre-tax in the second six months if sand and gravel does no worse, But even If it does earnings after a full tax charge and minorities would not cover the 134 per cent, dividend costs despite the interim being paid net. However, minorities may be smaller in the second half which might Just do the trick. Nonetheless, It is hard to see Berk resisting the trend of industrial acti. vity in the immediate future. Thus, with the group facing so small a margin of error, the shares at a new \"low\" of 10s 10%d to yield 6.1 per cent. on the old rate can have few friends for the moment. See also Page 12 Blackwood Morton Blackwood Morton caught a cold in the last four months of its year and the initial improvement in carpet sales has not lasted. Profits for the year are down from Â£873,000 before tax to Â£744,000, giving earnings of 23.2 per cent. for the maintained 17Y, per cent. dividend. At 9s 3d, therefore, Blackwood Morton yields 9.7 per cent. with a P/E ratio of 7% times. Both are very much in ine with other carpet shares, and expecting a grim immediate future. There is at present little reason why Blackwood could claim to be an exception to the rule. It is too dependent on the U.K. market, which accounts for something like threequarters of profits. It is too vulnerable to fluctuations in the price of wool with nylon taking less than a fifth of total fibre re- quirements. Also, it is at present almost wholly committed to woven carpets and has so far concen- trated all its modernisation pro- gramme on that side. This may help hold costs in line, but it does little to offset the fact that tradi- tional carpets are fast becoming a static market. Though this policy may now change, the initial costs of building up the tufted side will be a drag on profits. And with Cyril Lord selling at just over eight times earnings, such a move in itself would do very little to improve BMK's market rating. See also Page 12 Calor Gas Since the Calor Gas chairman is unable to say whether the group will qualify for the new cash grants it is strange for him to repeat that the dividend would have been a point higher at 10 per cent. but for the Freeze. For if one excludes the Â£253,000 of investment allow ances and adjustments relating to previous years, then earnings in 1o65-66 were in fact only 9.7 per cent. Nor does Calor seem to be in any position to distribute to the hilt, for despite raising a Â£3m. debenture last September net liquidity amounts to only Â£234,000. Capital commitments, on the other hand, amount to Â£2.3m. against the depreciation charge of only Â£1.52m. At 8s 3d the shares yield only $% per cent. and are thus relying on the extra point being added to the dividend in the current year. This in turn must hinge on a useful rise in profits, but despite cheerful nolses about the anhydrous ammonia project and last year's heavy capital spending, the chair. man eschews any forecasts. With a P/E ratio of 17 times the share price is still convinced that Calor has good growth prospects, but it will have a hard task to live up to its reputation. See also Page 13",

   "text_content" : "A BOOST to Nigeria's cocoa farmers was givw yesterday th announcement that the Mid- Western Nigerian Marketing Board is to pay out a ton for grade one cocoa for both the Main and Light crops, 25 a ton more than has been offered during the last year. Although this s still well below the Board's buying price in earlier years-during the previous five years Nigerian cocoa farmers were paid an average of Â£109 a ton- nevertheless London observers con- sider that it should provide the incentive needed to improve cultivation techniques and take more stringent action against disease. The London Cocoa Terminal market was not affected by the news. The December contract closed at 185s 3d, a fall of id on the day. Suggestions that a higher price was being offered in anticipa- tion of a shortfall in the forth- coming crop were entirely dis- counted. Dealers said that the price was merely being raised from an exceptionally low level. The London arket is, in fact, still being dominated by the large specula- tive position whic has bult up on the New York market during the last few months. Opinion is divided as to how much speculative element is left in the market after the big shake out of the last few weeks Prices have dropped b some Â£40a ton, but the number Sopen positions in New York still adds up to some 32,500 lots. In London the credit squeeze is prob- ably forcing the liquidation of non- essential stocks. However, besides the speculators the market contains con- siderable manufacturing interest, ndi- cating that some parts of the trade consider cocoa is a bargain at current prices. impkossibep to may* whehe toal so ocabI t h peet time Asia cro.

Sir Robert Kirkwood, chairman of the International Sugar Council, who has just returned to Jamaica from London, where Common- wealth sugar producers have been Sholding discussions on how best to bring about an international agree. ment, said that such an agreement would never come about unless there was restriction on sales to bring supply in line with demand. Commonwealth countries had agreed, he said, to decide the nmnimum export quotas they would accept when the Preparatory Working Group of the UNCTAD resumed meetings in London on September 26. Sir Robert said he was very anxious to get down to the detailed consideration of ways apd means whereby an effective International Sugar Agreement could be put together during the course of 1967. so that it could come into force not later than January 1, 1968. He also stated that in view of the con- siderable difficulties that existed, combined with the attitude of cer tain major lugar exporters to the world market, an immediate start would have to be made with nego- tiations if anything was to be achieved next year. KINGSTON, Sept 5. \"If we cannot reach agreement next year,\" he said, \"it is most unlikely that we shall ever again see an International Sugar Agree- ment\" Meanwhile, British West Indies su ar roducers are to approach the U.. Government to secure that por- tion of the U.S. sugar quota which Puerto Rico fails to supply each year. This was one of the resolutions of the sixth annual conference of the Carib- bean Cane Farmers' Association held in Puerto Rico recently. In an interview on returning to Kingston Mr. W D Roberts, secre tary of the association, said that the conference bad noted that Puerto Rican sugar production was declining, and because of the proximity of the Caribbean countries and the need for assistance, a good case could be presented to the U.S. Govermeont,",

Early potatoes are a , ambler's crop. The first to be harvested make high prices, but a 1 Slate frost can undo any farmer's hopes and so allow the crop from other and more favoured regions to seize the prize. Then as the yield increases the price begins to Sdrop and the farmer's skill lies in matching yield to price drop to Smake the highest price per acre. SSolari's experience in the trade and d his own business is of immense a dvantage to him here. r But as a farmer he makes sure r his potatoes are as close to perfec- n tion as they can be. His soil is i thin and sandy, excellent for grow. I - ing root crops, but needing plenty 1 b of fibre or humus to make it ser- i I tile. So his main preparation for I . potatoes is a one year ley of clover and cocksfoot which brings litti revenue from the first cut, which h sells to neighbours for hay. Th second cut is left to grow an plough in for the next year' potatoes. This means that hi potatoes have to pay for two yean rent, but he thinks it's worth ii The rest of his cropping is 50 acres of cereals and 100 acres a sugar bet. To guard against a May drough his whole farm is irrigated, and thi watering not only helps his cro in a dry time, but will also, t some extent, keep frost at ba3 Every day gained in this marke race counts. He has recently e) tended his farming interests b buying a 500-acre farm on th Lleyn Peninsular in North Wale There in the mild marine climat he is convinced that he will be abl to get his crop earlier than anyoni even than South Cornwall U Pembrokeshre. His invasion of the Lleyn ha been atched by the locals of this predominantly grazing district with considerable alarm. If Solari succeeds, will he be followed by other English farmers prepared to outbid them for their land or forceD them in self-defence to follow suit? Besides potatoes his other main ante is his herd of Large White. Pig. He has 140 sows and they are kept on what has come to be known as the Solari system. The first essential in successful pig keeping is that the stock should be free from disease; coughs. pneumonia and scours eat away the profits of many pig farmers. Solari's pip are what are called minimal disease. bred from stock known to be free of the worst porcine afflictions. No Sweatboxes There are not many sources from which to purchase these minimal disease stock, but those that have them are convinced that they have one of the answers to pig farming success. The pigs themselves are kept intensively, but there are no sweatboxes or similar horrors. Solari believes that pigs should look to be comfortable and that their housing should not offend one's own conscience, and the figures he showed me convinced me that this consideration for his animals' welfare most certainly did not harm his pocket book. No newcomer to farming, and 25 years that he has been farming hardly counts as establishment in farmers' eyes, can hope to become accepted in less than a lifetime, but Solari is an exception. His neighbours all seem to give hin, credit for considerable achieve- ment and many of them are pleased to copy what he has done. His farming was. I thought, one of the best examples of applying business principles to the art of farming that I have seen for a I long time.",

   "text_content" : "GOVERNMENT oficials and pri vate economists who are calling for tax increases to restrict demand may be confusing what is largely a foodaid-seicres inflation with a general industrial goods inflation, says dIte irst National City Bank in its September economic letter. It adds that advocates of addi tional demand-restricting measures seem to be underestimating the real growth potential of the economy and neglecting measures to increase supply. Raising, personal income taxes again-on top of higher Social Scurity and State and local taxes- would reduce the incentives for work while whetting demands for higher wages says the bank. Demand was permitted to grow too rapidly in the latter half of 1965 Snd early 1966 because of overly expansive fiscal and monetary polides arlier, and some of the inflationary o li i But present evidence does not seem to support the idea that demand is now growing at an excessive rate. Real growth of GNP slowed to an annual rate of 2 per cent. in the second quarter and the unemploy- ment rate has continued to hover around 4 pert cent. It is likely that. inflation can be checked more effectively now by increasin supplies and encouraging productivity growtb than by Checing demand precipitously and suppress- ing individual movements of wages and prices, Citibank believes. In light of the leading role played by food prices in the current inflation, measures to boost food sup pies may be among the most effec tive .ant-nflationary weapons now available. \" Incrased production and higher productivity can go a long way toi ward solving the problem of Infla tion,\" Citibank concludes. \"Too much time and energy is now being wasted in bickering over bow to divide up the econoipR when a* oVr answer is to bA a bigg",

   "text_content" : "THE APPALACHIANS, the eastern highlands of the U.S., are beinning to benefit from a new prosperity-the result of a persis- tent and, to-day. mot lavish pro- gramme of economic rejuvenation. It is at least 30 years since the life of the \" mountaineers\" came to be regarded as a national problem rather than a national peculiarity. After various British expeditions had ventured into the valleys to admire the folkways of the inhabi- tants and draw affectionate paral- lels with those of the Scottish and Irish settlers who 200 years earlier had provided their ancestry, In 1935 there came an elaborate survey of the most depressed, southern part of the region, mounted with the help of local churches and universi- ties. The basic conclusion was that the human and material resources of the area were seriously out of balance and that living standards could only be brought up to those enjoyed by the rest of the country if there were a drastic shift in the relationship. With this in mind, Civilian Con- servation Corps projects were steered towards the valleys, leaving them with a string of mountain highways and lodges which,in their own, motorised way, still outshine the Alnhutte of Austria and Switzerland. To relieve overcrowd- ing in the coalmining outposts, one of the earliest and boldest of American family planning pro- grammes resulted in a fall by more than 25 per cent in the birth rate of some communities. Mechanisation in Coalmining Nevertheless, a Government report published during the first flush of the economic boom that followed the Second World. War found that the coalminer was still longer on misfortune and shorter on hope tan almost any other group of American workers. The communities in which he lived, \"scattered houses on stilts, perilously perching, with their privies behind them, on steep hill sides,\" can still be ecognised, even now, on a drive through the extra- ordinarily prolific coafields of the Cumberland Plateau. Thsevillages -\" mining camp \" as they are more graphically called - seem fated to decline still further. The coal industry has recovered. But mechanisation is being pushed so far that only one in ten of the miners' ons of today may be able to follow their father down the mine. With the largest source of mployment thus shrinking, Appalachia is having to look else- where for support The Appalachia Regional Commission, organised a year and a half ago and endowed with an opening fund of more than Sl,000m., was tailored to meet just this need. It followed up and enlarged upon an Area Redevelop. ment Act signed by President Kennedy five years ago and pro viding loan and grants for both industrial projects and public works. Extended to include a corner of New York State, it now covers 50 depressed counties stretching through Pennsylvania southwards to the Carolinas, Alabama and Georgia. Outpouring of Funds It would be ungracious as well as inaccurate to claim that there is so far nothing to show for a long history of effort and this new outpouring of funds. A network of staff and offices has been set up, and relief has been organised i areas that have been hit by floods, fires and other emergencies. Re- doubled efforts in soil conservation. selective reafforestation urban drainage improvement and open- cast mineland rclamation even created a lbour shortage in some areas this summer. Most conspicuous and costly of all, meanwhile fourane high- ways on 100-foot embankments are gradually pushing their way, by work that starts at daybreak and gives preference to local men, into some of the remoter valleys. Roads will take around 850m, of the funds allotted for the Appalachia Programme. But of the 3,350 miles of trunk and local roads to be constructed over a six-year period, only 200 miles have so far been started. With schemes such as these, the programme may not yet be pull- mg at the grass roots problenmsof the area, but it is stimulating a ,forward movement aleady began. Six years of relative prosperity have worked wonders for the metal and petrochemical plants of West Virinia, the drugs and ture business of North Carolina and textiles in Georgia and Alabama. The space programme and a few other Government- sponsored projects have attracted new families-some of them living in luxuriously upholstered trailers in the gardens of the unpainted, clapboard dwellings of the hill- billies. Generally, however, the industries that have helped to brin uneployment down sharply in the A achian states are located in the foothills rather than the valleys. The main exception is the tourist industry. This now yields more iioomean most areas than forestry, an old stand-by that has been reduced mainly to a wood-pulp business as the bustling lumber camps of a few decades ago have grassed over and disappeared in the second growth of timber. It should develop further as the high- way programme opens up more of the country, though it wil also need to provide a superstructure of hotels, sanitation and other con- veniences of a standard to which most American tourists are accus- tomed. And in some of the remoter parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, it is said that the idle, pleasure- loving ways of tourists are still regarded as an offence rather than an opportunity by the old-timers. Earnings Under $1,000 A Year In the farthest mountain \"coves,\" industrial development is out of the question and even to- day's record agricultural receipts are doing little to help, The sheep and chickens raised on remote hill farms are not limited by any Government agricultural controls, yet the earnings on such farms are often less than $1,000 a year, or only a third of the official \"dis- tress \" level in the U.S. With poor economic prospects at home, a growing number of youngsters from farm families are now moving to industrial jobs in nearby towns and; for the first time since the region was settled, the Appalachian Mountains are losing population to the surrounding lowlands. The SAppalachian Programme has not Syet been able to make much of an impact in these isolated areas, ' though their improved labour I mobility could be more imminently . what they need.",

In 1965 the after tax profit brought in from this subsidiary was Â£43,608 of which a considerable part was due to taxation adjustments an to revaluation of the stocks in Australia. This year dividends and interest from the consideration for the sale were approximately Â£7,800 after taxation.

Our finances are healthy and after paying tax on the new basis we have ample cover for the dividend at last year's rate.

Herts. Procrastination Sir,;--Those of us who deal regularly with the building societies and the general public, and also most building society branch managers, have known for many months now that in order to attract a reasonable amount of money from inves. tos t must pay them at least 4M per cent and carge at lest 7 per cent. to the borrowers, the 3par cent margin being suficient (with some qualifica- tion) to pay the compote rate of ta management charges (in- cluding S.E.T.) and allowing a margin for reserves. The build- ing socity movement should realise that, in .general, it pro- vides mortgage facilities virtually unrivalled anywhere in the world at rates of interest (net of tax relief) which are also un- rivalled elsewere. The societies have nothing to be ashamed about in putting up the rates of interest and t sooner they state this publicly the better it would be for borrowers. SThe time has come for the Societies to stop licking the Chancellor's boots and tell him that they intend their rates of interest to investors to be com- ptitive with those offered bythe Government and other institu. tions seeking finance. If the Chancellor wishes to keep the mortgage rate down, he must do so by keeping allied interest rates down and not by implied threats of nationalisation.

Tax Free Sir,-Could some building society expert explain whether substantial advantages would flow from making interest from building societies free of income-tax and surtax (subject no doubt to a prudent maxi- mum) and interest payable to a building society non-allowable against tax and surtax? Surely this would enable the building societies to reduce the rate of interest payable as the depositor would effectively secure a high gross figure and thus remove the necessity to charge a high rate of interest.

Mr. Makin stated that the cost of the Giro brochure must make the Â£%m. spent by Bar- clays Bank on advertising its cards look like chicken feed. As the Postmaster-General ex- plained in the House of Com- mons, the total cost of the brochure was Â£28,000. This in- cluded printing and distribution to larger businesses, commercial institutions, public utilities, local authorities, trade and profes- sional associations and their members, and Government Departments.

   "text_content" : "Sir,-In the days when build- ing societies existed for the purpose of enabling their mem- brs to own house, they were run at low cost by te member ship. Since then they have developed throsgb various phases, allied with builders here, property developers there, have provided a tax saving home for investors, jobs for solicitors and surveyors and rising incomes for estate agents. Though they are now full-blown commercial institutions and compete for investors funds with each other and with all kinds of commer- cial and financial investments and spend large sums in adver. tising, they still claim the privi- leges of a social service they no longer perform. lake one example. Most houses which change hands nowadays are already mort- gaged to a building society. At one time it was common prac- tice for the mortgage to be transferred from the seller to the buyer. Nowadays if this is suggested one is met with downright obstruction from buildig societies estate agents and solicitors alike, obviously because the saving to the buyer means a loss of fees to sur- veyors, solicitors and agents and because no redemption fee can be charged by the society It is possible to get a mortgage transferred, but one has to be tough indeed to force it through agaTnst the pressure to repay te existing mortgage and create a new one, with all the waste in money and time which this involves. Take another example The proposal to raise te rate of interest upon existing mort gages, without any discrimina tion as to the length of time the mortgage have existed is a savage attack upon the sanctity of contract. Long-term arrangements should not be broken because of short-term considerations without prior reference to the persons concerned and 1 do not know of one society which has referred this question to its membership. Ypt while some of the mortgages affected have been in existence for many years and show a margin in security of 80 per cent. or more, new mortgages are still being granted upon highly inflated property values with a deposit of only 5 per cent. or 10 per cent.

France may go over to enriched uranium for part of It4 current nuclear ener prograune, Electicit de France hinted today in its annua report for 1965. f a decision along these lines were taken, it would represent a major breakaway from the traditional French doctrine that the national nuclear civil power programme should be exclusively oas_ .i on aurai uranliui. The tag of enriched ranium, as fr as the French are concernd, is that it' wold have to come from the U.S.. and would almost certainly have to be used in reactors designed by American companies. The use of enriched uranium reactors during the current five year programme would also be a reversal of the Governments decision taken in December, 1964, that natural uranium would be used exclusively during the Fifth conomic Plan (1966-70 Authoritative official circles were eculating here' to-day that lectricde Prance may be attempt. ing to force the Government's hand on the issue. In the conclusion to its annual report, ED confirms that the minimum programme of 2.5in kW agreed for the current five-year period will be based on the existing natural uranium gas graphite design. But it also argues that the action for extending these programmes to 4m. kW should be taken up, and that in this additional slice the use of enriched uranium-which has been employed to a large extent abroad-should not be excluded. The EDP report claims that the \"complementary exploration \" of the use of enriched uranium for the optional 1.m. kW also has the support of the Atomic Energy Com mnssion. This does not appear to be the case, although it is clear that th two bodies are at present studying all the options which are ope for the Sixth Plan, after 1970, including the use of enriched uranium. The report of their joint working group is expected to be completed ater this year, and the Government is expected to take its decisions on the Sth Plat by; the end of 1967. it may well be, therefore, that ES is already trying to recipita change of mind before rema min elements of the Fifth Plan have been irrevocably fixed. The first sign of serious French interest in American-designed enriched uranium reactors, came when EDF started negotiating for a share in a plant to be built in 1969 in Switzer land, near Basle. Final decisions on this have still to be taken however. Last year, French civil nuclear energy production almost doubled, from 580m. kW to 900m. kW. and it is clear that the Frerch authorities have been encouraged by the result of their gas graphite reactors -at Chinon. At the end of last year the Government authorised work on a second plant at Saint Laurent des Eaux, with a power of 515 MW.",

This month A the harvest should be completed ui flt Kaakhstan and Siberia, and 1S after that there sould be some 2 ints about th otal i f t harvest and about the extent to w which the Soviet Union may Want rn to'buy foreign wheat. Meanwhile, it seems a 11od t moment to look at the life of the peasants who still comprise about ft a quarter of the country's popu- s lation-or Wome 60m. people (in- cluding child and old peope). Under Stalin and for some time afterwards, the collective farmers were the worst treated section of the population. They had no guaranteed earnings, but snply a sare of the proceeds of the food f sold compulsoriy to the State at hi deriory prices. heir earnis are o still not guaranteed, but a seres h of price increases hve made them considerably greater. In addition. i the collective farmers have at ei last, very recently, been given tt some social security benefits. h New House of l Culture A vivid sketch of one collective , farm has just been published by d the Soviet Government newspaper I Izvestiya. The paper's woman correspondent, B. Olkhovskaya o went to the \"Dawn\" farmin the Nikolayev region of the Ukraine. ji Shc found the havest already corn- c pleted (ikolayev is by the Black h Sea and thus a very warm region) and the farm chairman, Mr. Boris f; Sidorenko, already away on holi- a day. Her article is in the form of t4 an open letter to Mr. Sidorenko about his farm., . On the purely economic front she \" has no complaints The farm has fulfilled its grain plan, and in the four villages compii the firm new buildings-a secondary school, i a House of Culture, a surgery, c dwelling houses-are going up. Average daily earnings have one I u to 2 roubles 68 kopecks (about 9s). This compares wth a mere t 72 kopecks (6s) in 1962. Though Olkhovskaya does not sayso, it *ill be clear to any Russian eader that the 1962 figure was Just not enough to live on, and the collective farmers must have I relied largely on their private plots for survival Now, writes Olkhov- skaya, she never heard that earn- ngs were low. 'On the contrary, Now we can live.' Hard work for milkmaids But it is the behaviour of the farm management that outrages her. It seems there is a shortage of milkmaids, because the work is hard though well-paid. The women have to get up at three in the morning, and are not finished until eight m the evening (although there are long breaks). Someone has calculated that a milkmaid with 15 cows has to contract her hand 10,000 times a day in the milking movement. The milkmaids feeling of being hard-done-by is added to by the fact that the farm chairman and his, deputies drive daily past the dairy, but never look in. Because of the unpopular nature of the work, Mr. Sidoreiko has taken simply to directing women into it. One woman, with small children, one of them in poor health, refused to go, so Sidorenko \"sacked\" her husband from his farm work. This was an illegal act, annulled later following an appeal to the local public prosecutor. But Olkhovskaya acknowledges that she was asked at the farm, \" What would you do if yu were Â·hairman? He's responsibefor the arm.\" She says that she would organise milking in two shifts, as. i done on other farms, and would consider mechanisation which ~l extensive in every part of the Dawn farm except the dairy. Olkhovskaya finds other things to criticise. Fines are freely levied: \"For a bad attitude to work- 5 roubles; for non-fulfilment of an instruction-3 roubles: for not attending a management board meeting-5 roubles; for unruly behaviour at a management meet- ing-5 roubles.\" All this is legal under the farm statute, says Olkhovskaya, but why not try persuasion? Other complaints include that of a sick woman made to do heavy work, and that of a man who asked for his wife to be brought back. from hospital in the car bought for this sort of purpose. but was told, \"when the lorry comes with the sacks they'll put your old woman on top.\" Tolstoy under lock and key When it comes to culture, Olkhovskaya has a hard time. She finds that in the club library the works of Leo Tolstoy have been locked away under an order to \"put away all books published be- fore 1957.\" There is only one newspaper in the club, the goods people want to buy are not in the shop, so they stand around drink- ing yodka in the centre of the vil- lage. \"We've got money, we're living well, so why not drink ?\", asks foreman Ivan Tribrat. One can imagine the reactions of farm workers to a woman re- porter from the capital telling them they shouldn't drink. But clearly she has plenty of valid points of criticism, and some of the people at least want a less rough and ready life. As someone in the vil- lage says to her, people want to liye \"beautifully, with a bright dream, with bread, and with roses as well.\"",

   "text_content" : "wne U.w., ame proporUon 01 or crete pavement laid by slip-fr methods is now over 80 per cent. In Britain, there is still only one such machine in use, and it is suffering from con* siderable teething troubles. But if and when these can be ironed out, concrete road constructors, who still build only a relatively small proportion of the aew motorway and trunk roads in this country, may have on their hands a machine which will improve their competitive posi- tion with the traditional black- top, asphalt road makers. Theoretical Saving A slip-form paver combines the activities of several different machines in one, Traditionally. a concrete road has been laid by a \"train\" of machines, usually mounted on steel tracks along the side of the road. This train of machines, all doing different jobs, can be spread over 150 feet or more while laying. The slip-form paver is 40 feet long and self-contained. It leads, theoretically, to con- siderable savings in costs, by eliminating the laying of forms at the edge of the pavement. Largely as a result of the lower labour force required on an un- reinforced concrete road, it is estimated that California's con- crte highway costs have been cut by using slip-form tech- niques by 10-15 per cent. Why, then, is this country so slow to adopt slip-form tech- niques? First, and most im- portantly, because specifications for concrete roads in this coun- try and in the U.S. are radically different. The Ministry of Transport requires that all con- that the feeding of concrete into the side of the machine d not rom the fron. Although ex* prints were carried out With un-reinforced pavi on the Cromwell by-pass last summer, it is not expected that the Ministry will be prepared to 2to mont, rad Mcirer is for the time being pers ing with various methodi of lay the reinforcement in front o the paver. The other main speci cation problem, still bing The concret paver. tackled, is that of exiansion and contraction joints. The Ministry of Transport requires more of these than are used in California, and they are not conducive to fast, continuous laying of concrete. Even if these snags can be ironed out, there is still a serious logistics problem. The whole of the base must be pre- pared in advance for such fast pavement-laying. And prepara- tions of up to a year in advance are needed to transport the re!=- vant amount of, raw materials to the job in question at a suti ciently fast rate. This last difficulty was under- lined recently when McGregor. used its slip-form paver for a short section of the Hamilton by-pass. It had contracted to do the job in two weeks. But it encountered difficulties with its side-feeding machines, and was unable to keep up to schedule. The schedule was in any case tight, because the two weeks chosen coincided with the Glasgow Fair fortnight, during which time the necessary amount of cement- and aggre- gate would be available: other rontractors would not ned the during the holiday. When that fortnight was over, the upply ran out, and McGregors was reduced to working at week-end to finish the work at all. The slip-form paver's prob- lms, therefore, are many, and to some extent feed on each other. The machine costs up to Â£80,000. ancillary equipment adds another Â£20,000, and batchers a further Â£50,000 or Â£60,000. Only by keeping the machine in almot continual work can it be made econo- mical. But at this stage the whole idea is considered so much of a gamble that only one company has been prepared to take it, which means that it is carrying the full financial risk of the spadework. Meanwhile, the asphalt road makers are watching with a certain degree of cynical de- tachment. Blaw Knox claims to have an asphalt paver in the design stage capable of con- tinuous asphalt surfacing over three lanes at a rate of 500 tons an hour. Limmer and Trini- dad has already used a German Vogele machine on the Northern Ireland MI which lays two lanes at a time and is capable of laying three, while considerable advances have been made possible by the Road Research Laboratory's discov- ery of how to roll coated chip- pings into asphalt while it is hot. The machine for this has been developed by Bristowes Machines. But in terms of pure poten- tial the slip-form paver has the most exciting possibilities for road construction of any on the market. The question over the next two years will be whether its potential can be realised in British conditions on roads built to British specifications.",

   "text_content" : "CAPE TOWN, Sept. S. THi COMMONWEALTH con. ference In London to-morrow will form an important backdrop for Dr. Verwoerd in Cape Town where he is expected to deliver a significant statement on South Africa's current position in inter- national affairs. The debate of the Prime Minister's vote in Parliament will probably lay heavy emphasis on the implications flow- ing from the South-West Africa judgment and the Government's determination to continue \"normal trade\" with Rhodesia. South Africa's key role in the failure to gain a quick result from sanctions so far mounted against her northern neighbour was reflected last week when, in response to a sounding out of South Africa's attitude by the British Ambassador, Sir Hugh Stephenson. the South African Foreign Minister, Dr. Hilgard- Muller, declared there was no change. During the week's debate Dr. Vet- woerd can be expected to spell out further his belief in not applying sanctions, while the South African Government embarks on a massive programme to stockpile oil and other essential goods in a bid to beat any eventuality, 'ncluding total sanctions.

There are about 105 listed in the current Mexico City telephone directory. Although by law all agencies must have a majority of Mexican stockholders. I1 bear the names of well-known U.S. com- panies. Two British agencies, Pritchard Wood and Colman Prentis and Varlev, have Mexican affiliates: but three U.S. affiliates. Grant, Foote Cone and Belding, and Intergard are headed by natives of Britain. The biggest and most profitable agency tn Mexico is Noble and Associates. founded 15 years ago by an American. with total annual billings in Mexico and Central America of nearly 3m. Agency Musical Chairs Companies steal each other's talent continuously. Capable, ex- perienced advertising men in Mexico are very scarce-particu- larly honest ones: the agency busi- ness is a continuous game of musi- cal chairs. Good men suddenly break off and start their own agen- cies on the slenderest of bases- and frequently make good. Some- times they have their agencies started for them. One big con- sumer product company, anxious to get rid of its manager but un- able under Mexican law to fire him save at great expense, set him up in an agency business with one of the company's brands as his first account. Another manager is a- stockholder in, the agency to which, he assigns.- prt of his company's business; his participa- tion in te agency i no secret to his employers\". SExcept for the three principal Maican breieries ad N'i estid, th ,biggest a rtisers in Mexico are all U.S. companie'- principally the soap and soft' drin companies. Many Meican companies still underrate the importance of adver- tisig in building demand for their :products, and tend to regard their advertising budget Is money to be dished out to friends and people with influence, rather than as a coldly calculated means for influ- encing the consumer. This is why so many magazines continue to exist from year to year in spite of having neither reader interest nor readers. THty are sustained by the adver- tising of businessmen who are fraid that, in some way or other, the magazines could do them harm. And in fact, it is by no means un- known for such periodicals to pub- lish slanderous and completely baseless canards about products whose manufacturers have refused to give them advertising. Mexico's libel laws being what they are. there is nothing much the manu- facturer can do about it; but since the paid circulation of such black- mail sheets is invariably only a fraction of what their publishers claim, the damage they do is usu- ally not nearly so great as the nervous fear of manufacturers. * One important source of adver- tising revenue for Mexican news- papers is the public letter. Mexican reporters, partly from timidity but principally because of lack of enter- prise. rarely dig up the facts about public controversies, but print Government handouts more or less as they are received from the Ministries. Often the only way a private company or association can get its story before the public is by buying space in the newslapers for a public letter, Paying for News \"Coverage\" This usually starts out by paying tribute to the sublime intelligence .and foresightedness of the President of the Republic. then goes on to explain why the Cabinet Minister or other Government official involved in the controversy has been misled. Frequently such an advertisement is followed a few days later by one from another association giving the other Side of the story. Hardly ever is a reporter sutfficietly in- terested in such public arguments to investigate and write lis own impartial report on the point in dispute--Or perhaps his bosses dis- courage him from doing so, prefer- ring to be paid fr publishing the news instead of having to ferret it out at their own expense.",

   "text_content" : "IN HIS SPEECH to the TUC, Mr. Wilson described the immediat and urgent test of Britain's cco- nomic will and resolve a her S bility to balance her overseas pay- ments. He renewed the provisional fore- cast of a swing from deficit to substantial surplus over the next. 12 months, and said that was quite apart from any benefit from the recent trend to cheaper imports. The Prime Minister made these points to the 1,000 delegate- 1--No economic letfup until Britain was paying her way. That meant the Government must govern, 2-Hoarding of labour was totally inimical to national recovery. 3-The unions must face. the challenge of ending every avoidable restrictive practice at national or workshop level. 4-Increased money wages with- out higher productivity were a hollow mockery, and the statutory prices and incomes powers would certainly, if reluctantly, be used if necessary. Any free-forp-al\" could plunge Britain into- a depres- sion with 1.5m. to'2m. unemployed. Mr. Wilson opened his address by expressing deep regret that George Woodcock was not able to be with them and offering the warmest hopes for his speedy recovery. \" No one will underrate the im- portance of your debates this week,\" declared Mr. Wilson. Future of the Country Itself \"Not, just on one issue, which has dominated the headlines, but on all the wider aspects of the nation's economy, for what you will be debatingis not only our future economic progress, but the future of our country itself, the main- tenance of full employment, the achievement of risin# standards for our people, our ability to play the part we all want to play in raising the standards of peoples living at much lower standards of life than our own, our strength and influence in the councils of the nations.' Mr. Wilson said he frequently received letters and resolutions from unions affiliated to the TUC asking, often demanding, that Britain s influence and Britain's weight be thrown behind some great issue in world affairs. \"But let us be clear that that influence, that weight, the power to Intervene, perhaps decisively the power to lead nallthese depend not only on our moral strength: they depend on our material strength, our economic power and vigour. our ability to stand on our own feet. \"As I said to congress here in Blackpool two years ago on the eve of the 1964 election, in the last resource no one will listen to a nation in pawn,\" An Index of a Deeper Malaise The Prime Minister declared that Britain's balance of payments prob. ecm was an index of a deeper malaise of 15 years In which they had not finally come to terms with the end of their Imperial posture In. which they had willed ends far beyond the means they were preared to make available by industrial effort. \"We are in danger of turin inwards on ourselves in pursuit or g leisure we have not .arne , of being debased by the philosophy of the nevcr-h d-lso.gooda socety. which withholds the resources needed to care for others n our midst, who hav 'never had it good at all.\" There was a dper ent the --4ithe develop a rgent e seas payftislt basish le of thethmy at Itseitt harmful led to loaR e round btilinga shoie atIts worst was 6 st wyo If that, from synd The Immediate and urgent test of Brlin's econiomic wlU andre msolve was her nability to bilnce ter over, senm payments.

   "text_content" : "IT IS NOT easy to say what the effects of the Selective Emlyment 3 Tax on consumers will since different families have different spending patterns, while shopsland suppliers of services are likely, to pass on (or absorb) the new tax in different ways in different parts of the country. But some idea of the efect can be worked out by look- ing at individual items in family budgets-starting with the direct cost of domestic service (which affects a great many middle-income families) aqd then looking at prices. Perhaps the most common form of d6mestic service is the charlady. If she is provided by a company the company is responsible for the 12s 6d a week tax; it will certainly ass on the cost. Some cleaning ms are already asking for in- creases of 14 per cent and more. But the little old lady from around the corner, contacted by an ad- vertisement on a notice board, is in a special position. Her case is best divided into two parts-the legal and the illegal. Liable for Stamp Legally, the person who first employs a charlady in any given week must buy her a national in- surance stamp. The only condition is that the woman in question must be working for eight hours a week or more. But the first employer buys the stamp for such a woman however lon&. or short, she works for him. Included in the stamp is the 12s 6d tax. Illegally, most freelance chars do not have national insurance cards; consequently they do not need stamps bought for them. The Government knows this, and winks at it, the reasoning being that most charladies consfder themselves covered by their husband's national Insurance card-as, indeed, they are. Thus anyone unfortunate enough to have a charlady with a stamped card will have to pay the tax if the lady works for hlM first; the Ministry of Labour advises such eople tr tor collect a contri- ution towards the cost of the stamp from people who employ her later in the week. Anyone who employs a charlady second in the week, or one without a card, pays no SET on her behalf. Au Pairs A Po rs. Most au par girls do not possess national nsurance cards, nor are they bound by the law to o so. With such girls there is no question of paying Selective Employment Tax. But some girls who have been In the country for a long time might have national insurance cards that require stamp- Ing; in those cases the employer must pay. Mals. Alone with butlers, chauffeurs, nannies, cooks, and othr' permanently employed domestic staff, the SET has to be paid at the full rate-12s 6d per Rwee for women, and 25: for men. But, as In all cases of domestic omint (Including charladies lY au pair), the elderly. Invalids, and single parents can apply to the t IÂ· 5, 5 t 5 SS Ii I) a V SMinistry of Soclal Security for t refuds. Genuine ard cases are Slikely to get them. Gardeners, like chimney-sweeps, Swindow-clneans and freelance handymen, are normallyeither self- employed (in which case there is n Selective Employment Ta pay- able) or employed by companies (in which the company pays the tax and is likely to increase the Scharge for its services). But full- time gardeners-as opposed to job. bing gardeners who go from house to house-render their employers liable to the tax if the stamp is bought for them. SThese are the direct costs of the Selective Employmeht Tax attribu- table to those families that have servants of one kind or another. But the other costs-the indirect ones arising frot higher prices in service industries-re also worth looking at in some detail. SMost laundries have put prices a up by S between Sand 10 per cent. a (say Id on each Is for housewives a wishing to anticipate their lists). a Advance, Sunlight and the Co. operative laundries are among those whose prices defnitely go up this week. Trust Houses has raised the prices in its hotels by 5 per cent, and the Hunt Edmund group of hotels in the Midlands is also Sincreaing Its charges, Hotel Prices Hotel prices will go up In step with public house prices. Col. W. H, Whitbread, chairman of r Whitbreads, told shareholders at the annual meeting last Friday Sthat the company would do its Sest to keep prices down-but also that he did not see \"how our tenants can absorb SBT without putting up some prices,\" Watney Mann has pointed out a to the tenants or managers of its , 8,100 houmes that beer pricls In a public bars cannot be raised be. 1, Ã½ Ã½ - Ã½ Ã½ -, Ã½ I re a, PÂ· i6 F ss re la IIÂ· bÂ· M re is M U-, te r. tt in th If rrr i), D. U ,r Ip ro IF: ,t at iy k ;o v rt It Ir n I), r cause of undertakings already a iven to the Government. But it is possible to increase beer prices in other bars, as well as prices of other products and services (say crisps and sausages) in all bars. Tenants will decide at their discre. n tion. As with so many other prices involving thousands of small Smen, there is no generalisation that holds true for all of them, but it seems that the middle-class family in the lounge bar will pay more, especially if the order is for the more expensive beers or spirits. Nor will it be any escape going to a Lyons for a cup of tea-the price Sis up Id to 8d, with another Id Sextra on all purchases under Is 6d and 2d on a purchase between Is 6d and Ss. Some small shopkeepers are, by all accounts, taking advantage of the tax as an excuse for higher prices-but the National Grocers Federation estimates that grocery costs will Increase by only between I and 2 per cent. It has recobn mended no increase where possible, and is not in favour of delivery charges-\" generally considered to be bad business,\" I was told. But there are some 60,000 grocer in the country and there is no telling what all of them will do. Hairdressing The same applies to the 45,000 hairdressers, who have been told by their Federation that average costings on ladies' hairdressing are likely to increase by 5 per cent. as Sresult of SET and othar taxation, while men' haircuts will cost =aroud 6d more.' Price increases of this order can be generally x- t, ed. Cinemas generally have Sasked to keep prices down, but one small company estimates an Increase of around 3d a seat. Driving school charges are also up -the British Schoo of Motoring is raising prices by around 10 per cent., and blaming It on SET, plus other taxation increases, as well as higher maintenance and other cost 's. What the overall extra impost on the average middle-class household budget will be is almost impossible to guess at this stage-but from all Sthe fgures I have collected It would Sseem that an extra 5 per cent. a year would not be too far out.",

   "text_content" : "IT WAS NOT to be expected that the Prime Minister would .receive an enthusiastic reception from the TUC delegates in Blackpool: his speech probably succeeded, nevertheless, in pro- ducing the effect at which he was aiming. His pointed references to outmoded labour attitudes and practices, his warn- ing that the future of full employment was at stake, his firm declaration that the Government would not hesitate to introduce compulsion if it did not obtain voluntary co- operation in the freeze on incomes and prices-none of this can have made pleasant hearing. But it may well have helped to create the sense of urgency that is needed, in individual factories as well as among the delegates in Black- pool. Not a solution The speech was, in fact, an essay in persuasion. It was meant to persuade the TUC to support the Government's policies, and so to impress over- seas observers: It, was meant to persuade union members that many industrial habits will have to be changed if the country is to remain prosperou. It was meant, finally, to persuade the electors in general that Labour has not failed in its promises and that deflation under 'the present Government is essen- tially .different from deflation under the Conservatives. Mr. Wilson brought forward no new facts to support his contention. He acknowledged, however, that the measures taken so far, though a condition of solving the country's economic problems, are not in themselves a solution. The mosi constructive section of hib speech, therefore, was thai which dealt with the need foi greater productivity and the future of the prices and incomes policy. On the first, he had some harsh things to say aboul restrictive practices, over manning and training methods and about the responsibility ol the trade union movement tc intervene more actively in thil field. It is encouraging that he was applauded-by at least some delegates at this point; thi unions know well enough whi needs doing. It remains to b seen, however, how successfi they will be in converting thei mqmbes at a time. when ui employMent is rising.,. Not a these meabers may be as coo sident as the Prime Minister ftb the gap in conumers' d will automaticaI bc iled higher exports and capiti investment.

He went on I refer to a number of key issu that would have to be decided- the role, of productivity agre ments, the position of workei in service industries, the trea meat of lower-paid workers, as the place of the Prices an Incomes Board in adjudicatic on wage claims. Knowing tt questions is certainly somethin but it is not the same as knowik the answers. The Governme is certain that we need a pric and incomes policy: it is al parently as far as ever frol knowing what that policy ougl to be.

But the fact I present that these things are at little more than pious aspi tions. The major breakthrouj in productivity the purposive deployment of labour, the pi manent slowiknsdown of waj inflation have still to be achieve Mr. Wilson ha no doubt th they will be achieved and th a basic difference therefore exh between his policy-and thosei his prdecssors.

There is serious over- capacity on the Continent in both nylon. 6 and nylon 66. In the latter. two new producers, ICI in Germany and Chemstrand in Luxembourg, have recently come on stream. A third. Du Pont, ,which started the whole process by introducing nylon to the world in I19 is d Iu to start: the world in 1939 is A ptoi st eing in Germany next year. he tndustry is suffering from a bad attack of indigestion which may last for a couple o( years. New Problems While some of these problems .are peculiar to nylon, there now in progress a general opening-up of world fibreo markets which preents the pro- ducers with new problems and new opportunities. Companies and countries which have been rotected by patents (like IC! in Terylene) are having to sharpen their competitive weapons as the patents expire and new pro- ducers come into the business. At the same time, the scope for growth is still enormous, not merely in wresting sales away from cotton and wool, but because the demand for textiles throughout the world is bound to accelerate as living standards EUROPE\"S LEADING Nylon 66 yo Cb.enstrund (Blue.

The new fibres themselves, leading to new types of fabric and new manufacturing pro- cesss, are helping to stimulate more rapid changes in fashion and what the Americans call \"wardrobe increase.\" As a Du Pont man recently put it, if fibres is a problem business, give us more of the same.\" To succeed in the business requires a combination of tech- nical and marketing skills which not many companies possess. Producers of fibres which, like rayon and now nylon, have reached the commodity stage, are under constant pressure to develop unique products which command a better price and a larger market than the standard a, grade. Courtaulds, with its big c stake in rayon, has introduced - new varieties, such as the high t .a strength Vijncel, and new blends. n like Tricelon, a combination of Sil acetate and nylon, which have It special properties. if Th chances of inventing a fe radically new fibre which would rank with nylon, polyester and ss the acrylics are small, but thet= .. is always the possibility of a h technical breakthrough which 2. dramatically enlarges the market c for an existing fibre. ICI's e Crimplene, the \"bulked\" p. version of its Terylene polyester, o has been a phenomenal success, h especially in the double-jersey a market, and there is an d insatiable world demand both sor me yan tratio ana ahr fabrics made out of thet yar; in this case a technical innovation has been backed by a brilliantly effective marketing operation. The polyesters and acryllv are still some way away from commodity status, because they are newer than nylon and their level of penetration into the textile industryis lowe. It is in the big-volume outlets, like blankets for the acrylics or net curtains for polyesters, where price competition is most acute. It is interesting that, of the two, the acrylics business is probably more stable from the point of view of competition. There was no patent protection from the start in acrylics, and the four mut neir own proteuon t ay bir competitive efforts. There ere no lush profits as there were in the early years of nylo iad polyesters, ibut equally there' as no headlong rush of new Ã½ompetitors when the patents .ay one day wid: n ts range byt producing olyesters, as Chem- itrand has aieady done in the U.S. On the marketing side the bre pr6ducers] have spent large sums to make the consumer waere of their trademarks but he industry is now beginning to question the value of this invest ment. In some types of apparel the consumer is more concerned with the styling of the garment nd the reputation of the gar uent maker (or the retailer) than with the fibre from which it was made. One of the attractions of Kayse3 fondodr to Courtaulds. :as that itsbrand name ranked almost as high in certain markets a Marks and Spencer's SSt. Michael. Price and Service While ICI has spent large sums on the promotion of Bri- Nylon, Courtaulds is followinga ore' cautious line with Celou, advertising selectively in certain markets, such as outerwear, where it is most likely to be effective. In negotiations with big buyers like Marks and Spencer or Littlewoods the brand image of the nylon counts for less than the price and service which: the producer can offer; w.hat matters, in many cases, is wl.hther, the finished. garment reaches the shelf at 59s or 62s 6d. On the other hand there is still plenty of co-operative advertis- ng in certain fields; for example, the nkalon name figures promi- nently in a current campaign for vril Lord carpets. This will certainly continue, but it may be ore difficult in coming years for the fibre producers to retain the initiative which a well- accepted brand name, like Courtelle or Terylene; provides. Other aspects of marketing will assume greater importance. SCaptive Oudets One obvious way of selling more fibres is to buy \"captive outlets\" in the form of fabric and garment manufacturers, In fbres, as in plastics (another ast-growing, highly competitive ndustry with similar marketing problems), this policy can be dangerous if carried too far. Courtaulds could not possibly survive as a fibre producer by selling only within its own group of garment companies. These arment-making interests are lpul n getting a new flbreo uch as Celon, off the ground, and Courtaulds' close nvolve ment in all branches of the extile Industry has probably strengthened its marketing approach. But direct investment In textile and garment manufac- ture is certainly not essential to success, as Du Pont has shown in the U.S., and it may make it harder to get business from inde- pendent customers. The crucial element is a constant feedback of information from fibre users to fibre producers, so that their products are tailored to the needs of the market. The fibre producers have not yet found a way of predicting, let alone dictating, changes in fashion, and this can have a disruptive effect on their busi- ness. Nylon's current troubles stem in part from a swing away from stretch fabrics in such things as women's slacks. The demand for Courtelle in double- jersey fabrics dropped sharply (though temporarily) a few years ago, and the same thing SYNTHETIC FIBRE OUTPUT IN WESTERN EUROPE (Millions of pounds) 1959 1964 Nylon .... 767 1,992 Acrylics ... 198 663 Polyester .. 192 745 Source: Textile Orgahon happened at one time to Courtaulds' Tricel, the triacetate fibre which had profited hand- somely from the boom in wide pleated skirts. This underlines the need for a wide spread of end-uses, so that the demand is steady enough to keep the fibre plants running close to full capacity. Du Pont's exception- ally high return on investment is partly due to its ability to keep its manufacturing capacity con- stantly better employed than its competitors, and this in turn stems from its astuteness in marketing. Number Limited All these marketing problems, quite apart from the technical know-how and the scale of investment that is required, will inevitably put a limit on the number of companies which can establish themselves securely in the fibres business. Indeed, what is happening now is that the same relatively small group of,~'owerful compaties is com- peting, both through local pro- duction and by exports from. their home base, in all the major markets of the world. Thus both Courtaulds and ICI are producing fibres in the Common Market and in the U.S..as well as in the U.K. The leading Continental producers have also established themselves in the U.S., either on their own or in partnership with American concerns. Competition among these giants will get tougher, but the two British companies have the resources and the know-how to win a large share of the world market. HAROLD WINCOTT on holiday",

About three years ago at a time when the effects o The \"izaceudble\" Elephant. ***p ev a - wr-r. w ava sMes worsening economic situation were just begning to be felt by the retailer, the larger com- panies were engaged on a mammoth programme of town centre developments. That brave new world is now foun- dering on the simple unpalat- able fact that it is very often the new shopping centres that are letting worst of all. As most leading companies and their advisers now agree, the cardinal principles of good positioning were all too often forgotten., undamentally the idea of the \"precinct\" development is a good one. It converts'low- cost backland into the market place. Frequently however the precincts led from nowhere to powhere. This weakness in relating the new development to the existing flow of pedes- trian traffic is reflected in many schemes. Consequently. some developments are suffering, at least from the retailer's point of .view. on the conservative shopping habits. of the house. wise.r, Mart of the \"faled \" schemes have proved incapable Of enticing the shopper beeaus of their sheer inaccessblity, witness the sea of traffic our- rudn th Elephant and -Retailer& have often found disappointments and an admittedly adverse economic situatiqn by restricting all expansion. The present situation is really a victory for the traditional adherence of the shopper to established High Street posi- tionsa over a number of faultily conceived schemes. There is no evidence to suggest however that the continued redevelop- ment and imaginative redesign of the existing shpping centres will not prove as proftablein the future as it has done in the past. Preston development hopes Murrayfield for example have focused th: existing heart of Preston's ihopping on their pedestrianised St. George's Centre.

The relationship between a trading turnover (from which of course rental value ti d Svised)l t~e postion of the shop and te pulation figures wi need to be closely worked out What is the secret, for example, of West Street. Horsham, where rental values touch Â£4,000 per annum despite a mere 22000 population. The answer would seem to be natural compactness. West Street. Horsham..is limited geographically by The Carfax at one end and the Worthing Road.traffic lights at the other. rhe result Is a concentration of peak trading that is. or should be, the aim of every retailer, developer and investor. Opportunities in next few years The opportunities in the next few years lie in establishing this type of position in the growing towns. In the latter ategory Northampton looks one of the safest bets. It enjoys clear promise of a population in- crease. More important still this increase should be backed by an equivalent growth in local industry. Looking ahead the main shopping centre of the 1970's will surely reflect a hardening nucleus, probably pedestrian- ised. of the larger multiple retailers. Around this will be a peripheral band consisting Slargely of the service trades (the better run dry-cleaners hair dressers, travel agents. etc), in this respect conforming to the American pattern. , SAll this will mean that a number of to-day's extreme secondary positions will revert to residential, office or munici- pal use. The independent small trader will probably be diverted to the local[ parade, mobile trading and to the highly pecialised and individualistic tradina areas of the Kings Road/Carnaby Street variety.

Among the ( results, Blackwood Moron's profits are lower and Sr marins have come back at in the first six month, altho they should show some improve meat in the second half ( ex, Page 1).

Backing this up the gro*p as pro- ' duced a 22 iper cent. ril in interim profits, before taxi to * Â£283.000 and a very ood chance- that the expected fr440,00 tohe year will be left well behinid. Exports in the frat six months I were 2Y2 times up. and althoul h I the ratio is only roughly '10 to 1 per cent., it is rising all the time, As fr as the domest scene is concerned York appeaft quite con sident. Thus. far frm: tthe antici- pated shortfall this year-a 50 0 downturn was looked or-the group could well come up with Â£550.000. leaving earnings at around 93 per cent. This gives 4 scope for a higher than forecast total payment: the interim is raised from a forecast 15 to 20 per cent. And this prospect could sit quite comfortably with the freeze. The point is that York is an over- seas controlled company. and thus appears to be outside the net. If the 5 points increase is held. yield imoroves to 5.4 per cent., with a PIE ratio of lU. J. H. Buckingham Fully bearing out the encourag- ing half-time report, pre-tax profit of J. IL Backinogab show an 18 per cent. rise to Â£462,000. The second half included the Christmas period and was rather more profit- able, but the year as a whole seems to have benefited in two ways. First, the results include a full contribution from Debretta, the N. Ireland acquisition, against eight months previously; and secondly, the knitwear extensions at Mansfield and Glaseow came into operation. It remains to be seen whether the squeeze has any effect on demand, but Buckineham looks reasonably placed with a Swide spread of products--shirts, Spyjamas. ties and knitwear. In any case, although the dividend js main tained at 20.83 per cent., there would have been scope for more -cover is around 2,4 times. Selling at only 5.85 times e.tninas and yielding 7.1 per cent.. the shares look an interesting proposi- tion at 3s. Winn .Industries 'Thc half-time results from Witn Itdustries are reasonably cheerful. With all four divisions miaking rogress turnover has jumped by a quarter to 4.,07m. The rise in profits is less spectacular at 10 per, ,ent, to Â£332,000 before tax, cipecially since it includes a first time contribution from the new Goodwin st'bsidiary - probably 7.000. But (t hides saome en 9o l p\"oint. Fcist an extra naraly surprising tat Devon is feeling the pinch on margins- following the merger pre-tax pro- fits at Â£395.000 were Â£30,000 short of the indicated target. And although the first few months show an \" encouragina increase\" in sales it is still too early to see how costs are faring. But certainly efforts are being made to economise. Modernisa- tion is well under way in the build. ing section; and in the distribution of solid fuels and oil, comprisina 10 per cent. of turnover, areas of operations ar being reorganised. The rest of the business, warehous- ing and'adistribution. has also seen improvqd methods brought in. But all this costs money, and the group's liquid position is not strong. The recent Â£lm. debenture did help cut down bank indebtedtne but it stll stood around Â£220000 on April 30 last. However capital commitmenets of Â£128.000 are at least covered by a cash flow of Â£144,000. At 10s 4%d the 9.6 per cent. yield, covered 1.2 times is not looking for any ,big improvement in the current year. Redman Tools But for the \"freeze\" an annual dividend of at least 24 per cent, would have been forthcomingfrom Redman Tools. On this basis at'12s the 2a shares would yield just 4 per cent. But this rating seems fully justified by the report, encouraging about immediate prospects despite 'the ecolnoic gloom. Orders are at a record level and all sections in this group of machine tool manu- facturers are fully occupie Of ooirse. ed ran' strength lies in its export business ,which accounts for around threur-teS of turn, over, and should provide a useful cushion against any slowing down in demand from the hoime market, But so far, no such decline 'has been seen and indeed two new extensions are now In use in Worcester to cater for increased. business, while further deve tanBs in progress. *; ps:+ +(++ ++ + ,+ + +;",

Countries in the European Pree Trade Association, it was pointed out, would by December 31 this year have common tariffs, and British-clothing could then be ex- ported duty-free to this market of nearly 100m. people. On the Common Market, it was agreed that an investigation should be made into the advantages for the industry if Britain became a member of EEC, and the Board of Trade had agreed to provide in- formation for a survey. The meeting also discussed methods of payment in the industry on the basis of two papers. One was on the incidence of piece wor in clothing factories, and the other on the views of the chairman, Mr Robert Appleby, as expressed t an earlier paper of his, on te merits of measured day rates as compared with piece work. It Was emphasised that measured time rates might have wider appli- cation in the clothing industry than had sometimes been supjposed. The committee decided that case studies should be prepared for fur- ther consideration of the, subject. Mr. Mason for Souith America Finanwial Tima Reportr Mr. Roy Mason.

   "text_content" : "TZ RACE that everyone will want to see at Doncaster this after- noon is the Champagne Stakes (3.50) for two-yearolds. run over seven furlongs, for included amons the runners are Bold Lad. impres- sive winner of the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot; Hambleden. who won the Chesham Stakes at the same meeting and who followed up this success with a comfortable victory in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood; and Ribocco, a colt by Riboti out of a Hyperion mare, -hom R. Johnson Houghton trains for Mr. C . W. Figelhd. These three colts are nbeaten as yet, and if the distance of to-day's race were five furlongs, or even a i furlongsa, Bold Lad would be my choice, for he is an exceptionally mature colt who could almost be mistaken for a aree-year-old. However, though he is bred to stay, being by the Nasrullah horse Bold Ruler, out of a full-sister to Hill Rise, he has the appearance of a sprinter, an it could be that he will be tap ing off a little in the closing stages. Ribocco is a taking individual. who is obvously mproving, bt the soundest claims, based on form, are those of Hambleden, whose decisive victory over Golden lorus in the Richmond Stakes at 3oodwood was made to look all the better when Oolde Horus lammed Falcon in the GCmcrack Stakes at York three weks later Hambleden, bred by Mrs. J. Hailward at her small stud *nar \"Templecombe In Somerset by lopement out of the prolific dam of winner2, Game Maria, is the selection, The Doncaster Handicap (4.20), which follows immediately after the Champagne Stakes, is a trappy event. Aberdeen and Mayville meet on precisely the same terms as for the Piccadilly Northern Cup at Ripon last month, when they finished second and third respect- ive to Tarqoan, separated by a neck. Mayville did not get a clear run on that occasion and can be -expected to reverse the placings with a fair cance of winning. The Rous Nursery Handicap (2.40) is another open affair, but Double Pont, whom S. Hall trains for Mr. R. J. Sigtia, the owner of Sodium, is a progressive type of dolt by Infatuation who will stay the ,distance and who looks to be reasonably treated with 7 st 5 lbs. Assuming that that good appren tice, E. Johnson. is able to get to the bottom of Bunker in the Great Yorkshire Handicap (3.20B. van Cutsem's colt will probably win for, with Jo'hnn claiming S lbs, he will have oly 6 st 12 lbs to carry. Bunker is not an easy ride, but earing in mind Johnson' competent handling of Shira in the Ascot Stakes and of Salvo in the Vaux Gold Tankard at Redcar, I am prepared to take a chance on his doing so. Probably te best bet on to-day's card s Drevno in the Clumber Maiden Stakes (4,50). This colt, by the 1961 Acot Gold Cup winner, Pandotll{, ran In the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby, which his Å½ax hI gdmits trainer, . Maxwell, freely admits was a mistake. But though DreOno Is not up to the clasic standard, he is, nevertheless, useful animal and, with Piggott in th saddle, can pick up a nlce",

The Taurodyne has a hydrostatc trans on, whic bacy is Ssystem in which the wheels are driven by ol pumped Into veins on them from a pump driven by the engne. It will drive either two or all four wheels. The first production model of a tractor with hydrostatic transmission, providing a single-gear stepless automatic transmission, has just given what was described as an impressive demonstration before technical and engineering representatives of British tractor manufacturers. Although the unit-a Taurodyne, being made for the Dowty Group by BSA at its Redditch (Worcs.) factory-has been offered to them, the first tractor manufacturer to take it up is Gebr Eicher Traktorenwerke, of Forstern, near Munich, which makes hIuhtt n1n S n vparn I The Eicher tractor was put through its paces drawing a five- furrow plough in adverse condi- tions at Brockhampton, a few miles from the Dowtv headquarters at Cheltenham. A Dowty spokesman said Eicher planned to build about 100 tractors with hydrostatic transmission in the next 12 months or so. Then, having acquired production \"know-how and the feel of the market, to increase Sthe volume. \" Initially the ractors would be equipped primaril for forestar work - one of the most punishing tests it could have,\" Together with variable speed power take off and winch, it would cost about DM3,000 (Â£270) more than a conventional tractor. The increased cost of hydrostatic transmission has, indeed, been one of the reasons why no British maker has yet taken It up, although a number are evaluating prototypes, using competitive, as well as Dowty units. While Dowty is without a British customer for the Taurodyne, a development of this, the Taurodrive, for application on fork lift trucks, cement mixers, combine harvesters and earth moving equipment, has been ordered by a road roller and a fork lift truck manufacturer. In addition, a cane harvester is currently undergoing field trials in Australia. A number of other manufacturers have prototype machines using Tauro- drive units but have yet to make final decisions, thouh we under- stand they are well on the way to doing so\" the spokesman said, The Taurodrive will be shown to the ublic for the fnt time at the Smithfield Show in December.

Meeting under the chairmanship of Mr. William Swallow, who re- cently retired as chairman of Vauxhall Motors, the economic de- velopment committee agreed that this was \"the most positive stop which can be taken immediately to improve the industry's foreign cur- rency earnings. The meeting also decided to widen the scope of its inquiries into the impact of Selective Em- ployment Tax by assessing the effect on different categories of workers. A study has been put in hand, too, of the cost of purchase tax changes affecting hoteliers and caterers. Meanwhile, the food processing industry's economic development com- mittee has decided to break away from holding its routine meetings at the National Economic Development Council's Millban* offices. On Monday, Sir Joseph Latham, the committee's chairman, plans to take members to Tate and Lyle's Thames sugar refinery and stage a formal meetinz durine a works tour.",

   "text_content" : "Swan Lake is the sto done of all ballets. A colleague with a taste for statistics tl that last night's performance- opening of Kirov allet's Coven Garden season-was about the 150th so far offered this year to British audiences. The work failed at its first performances in both St. Petersburg (1877) and Moscow (1880); ever since then a long line of choreographers, starting with Hansen (Moscow, 1880), and Petipa and his assistant Ivanov (St. Peters- burg, 1895), have worked over it. Gorsky, Messerer, Balanchine. Bourmeister, Helpmann, a whole syndicate for Festiv alalet's last Lake but one, Orlikovsky, Carter ... the list is much, much longer. Some choreographers have gone back to the pre-Petipa scenario and score. Some have made German Romanticism their start- ing-point (for in atmosphere Swan Lake is essentially a German ballet of forest enchantments, a piece of Gothic romanticism, while The Sleeping Beauty is a Frenchified fairy tale). The Bolshoy Lake is an heroic drama in which youth and courage overthrow the old tyranny. The Kirov version con- centrates on one thing only, and that the most important: the dance. It is a wonderful perform. ance-though not a whole one. In St. Petersburg/Leningrad the Maryinsky/Kirov tradition con tinues uninterrupted. The Kirov choreography is not identical with that of the Royal Ballet II produc tion (and specially in the last act, Konstantin Sergeyev seems to have been revising), but these are the two Swan Lakes in which the Petipa-lvanov composition ii retained most stilly. They are the least modern, and in dance-imager3 the most poetic. The Kirov version is, however, a suite of dances, not a drama. There is no \"production.\" The usual kinds of theatrical illusior are dispensed with. The prince changes his shoes in mid-act foi his solo, again during his pursuil of Odette to the lake. He handi his crossbow into the wings to free his arms for a pas de deux. Ii was probably not deliberate thai S But-enormous but-dancing of a glory and radiance suh as only the Kirov can provide. Is it enough? From the previous Kirov e season I remember my firt mixed t reaction: that one sees all too r clearly what Fokin was in revolt Sagainst, and sees with equal clarity e that the company have preserved D something precious. Much is miss- e ing but the essence of Imperial S'ballet is there. A museum art it n seems at first, and subdued, self- 1t contained, unexciting. But one 4f learns to find in it rewards as e satisfying as, and sometimes more d deeply moving than, more openly s vivid, more strongly characterised h dance-drama can provide. d Yury Soloviev, young star of the 1' Kirov's previous visit, has returned d as their prince, with, inevitably, e some of his boyish freshness of \" personality lost, and in its stead a soaring command of space, air and e style. Jumps so effortless, turns so \" smoothly controlled, phrasing so v certain achieve their own elo- h quence. Kaleriya Fedicheva, : Odette and Odile, sings in attitude, t, traces an open, fluent line, boldly o and firmly moulded. One feels the e lines of expressive force rising up, le from that splendid Kirov back is through her shoulders, so that all le of her is dancing. y \"Style\" is indefinable, but the Kirov dancers have it in abund- r, ance: in their carriage, their soft I. leaps, their instinctive judgment of le how romantically a classical move n may be phrased without exaggera- *e tion. Part of their quality lies in >r the blend of freedom with disci- it pline, in firmness of well-founded Is technique plastically moulded; and e part in their insistence that the It dancing; the dancing alone, must it carry the expression. t t: t t I ( t 8 E I : a a a , a ( a a a a 1 I I I c I 1 1",

   "text_content" : "When Poppea was first per formed at Glyndebourne a few years ago, the hearing of more Monteverdi became a necessity of life, and nothing was more wel- come than the news that Raymond Leppard, who had realised Poppea for this production, was going to Italy in search of manuscripts and scores, on the principle that a dusty chest in the attic of some palazzo in Venice must contain one of Monteverdi's twenty-odd lost operas. He has not yet found one, but he came back.with a first-rate Mass by Monteverdi's successor, Cavalli, as well as an opera by the same composer which is to be done at Glyndebourne next year, The Missa Concertata was per- formed at the Westminster Abbey 900th anniversary celebrations in May. I missed it then, but heard it last night, when it was the main work in a splendidly enjoyable Prom conducted by Leppard with the English Chamber Orchestra and the BBC Chorus. No doubt the Abbey setting enhanced it and supplied a more positive and atmospheric resonance than the poor old Albert Hall can provide. As a work scored for double choir, it could also have done with a larger chorus, I thought, not so much in order to produce a more massive body of sound, as to give greater force and brilliance to some of the individual lines, All the same it made an admirable effect. It is a delightful vwork, The harmonic simplicity and melodic repetitiveness are deceptive and rarely, if ever, seem a limitation. One quickly feels one's way into an idiom In which continual con trast of sonority, vocal and Instru- mental, is a fundamental element of musical composition, at least as important as rhythm and even more important than melody and harmony; and once that happen one can appreciate the variety and freshness of Cavalll's dramatic invention, The work is full of telling stroke*: the radiant almost amorous playfulness o the solo soprano's Donine Deus, mar. vellously sung by April Cantelo! the pride and joy of the Ni rrsurrexll, sng by two solo tenors (altos in the sore) callina the tremendous news to each olher as if from tower to tower across . great ringing distance; the clamorous, even confident demands of \"suscipe, suscipe deprecationem nostram, the soloists and then the chorus breaking into shorter note values and brisker rhythms after the long, smooth phrases of the Qui tollis; and throughout, the cunning varying of mass and colour, splendour and intimacy, homophony and polyphony. It is an essentially cheerful work,, the expression of a golden, ceremonial religion and a cvilisation satisfied with the visible duties and mysteries of this world, The work was done with fine conviction and vitality under Ray- mond Leppard. There were parti- cularly good solo contributions from April Cantelo, Yvonne Min- ton, Gerald English and Stafford Dean. The second half of the concert consisted of two choruses from Handel's Samson-\" With thunder arm'd\" and \"Let their celestial concerts\"-which made me long to hear the whole work, and an excellent performance of the second of Mozart's great piano concertos in C major, K.503, with Stephen Bishop as the soloist. The Albert Hall is notoriously hostile to this genre, but I have never heard one sound better. The secret must partly have been the use of a small band: you do not expect volume of tone (which no amount of strings will give you in any case) and you get a compensating clarity. But one cannot overpraise the buoyant, lucid and incisive playing of he ECO under Leppard, From the moment the work began, at an ideal tempo, one felt it was going to be a fne per' formance, and it was. The work can sometimes seem rather bare, a not quite fnished painting, as if Mozart had just failed to fil in all the details of his great design. But this performance dispelled all doubts: it was grand and wonder- fully rich and tuneful, It is difficult to judge the finer points of concerto performance in the Albert Hall, but Bishop's play- Ing seemed to me altogether more poisad and authoritative than his recent performance of K,4s7, ex' citing thoulh that was, This had all the same viva-lty and maglna tver nenl combined 'with a superb",

   "text_content" : "It was a splendid idea on the ;art of the Scottish National rralit Galler t present exhibiti on the them of the Scot in Italy in the eighteenth century at a time like the present when currency restrictions in Britain have virtually abolished foreign travel. We may draw some consolation from the fact that if we have less foreign currency to spend abroad than the Egyptians we do better than the Tunisians I The occasion of the Portrait Gallery's exhibition has also been taken to publish a most attractive booklet on the subject of the ex- hibition. Written by Mr. Basil Skinner, this must be warmly praised as a lively and informative introduction to an attractive chapter in social and artistic history and its modest price (3s 6d) should make it into a best seller. Mr. Skinner succeeds in evoking that fascinating and colourful world which existed in Italy, above all in Rome. Then the visitor to this city never knew if he was going to bump into a Jacobite or a British agent, a learned antiquary or a squireen masquerading as a Milord, or a talented artist-a Richard Wilson or a Hubert Robert. The panorama of cosmopolitan life in a city where could be met what Chesterfield termed \"the constant collision with good company\" might well tempt a historical novelist to paint a broadly touched- in canvas of the period and its personalities. Life was by no means simple- and ahead lay the collapse of eighteenth-century Roman life with the French occupation. Rome, too, was the home of the exiled Stuarts where, after a difficult and penurious start, the Old Pretender had placed at his disposal the Palazzo Muti and for part of the summer, the court would go to the Palazzo Savelli in Frascati. The decline of the Jacobite cause culminating with the death of Prince Henry Benedict. Cardinal York in 1809, makes a dismal tale, which is relieved by the Prince Regent's generous commission in 1819 to Canova for a monument in St Peter's to commemorate the House of Stuart. The exhibition appropriately in- cludes various portraits of the Old and Young Pretender and of the Cardinal York, as well as of such faithful Jacobites as the Duke of Perth and William Hay. We are reminded also in the booklet of men like the Abbe Grant and Andrew Lumsden. Visitors to Rome had to watch their step and Colonel WHiOin Gordon Allan Ramsay and his wife showed a certain coldness to Lumsden, then Under Secretary to the Old Pretender, when he called on them. Eighteenth-century British visi- tors to Rome were inclined to settle in or near the Piazza di Spagna and this quarter was even known as the Ghetto degl'lnglesi. If they were well off they tended to take rooms above the Spanish.steps by the Trinith de'Monti and the artists and poorer visitors found lodgings either in the Piazza or nearby in inns such as the Albergo di Londra or the Albergo d'Inghi- terra. They would frequent the caf6s, especially the Cafft deglr- Inglei with its decorations by Piranesi in the Egyptian taste and where a subscription newspaper from London. was available. For. tunately, one Scottish artist, David Allan, executed a number of enter- taining drawings of Roman life wRucn nave oeen IcnT to we exeii- tion by the Queen. 0 o Not qll visitors were impressed w b Rome; one good lady, the wife T o1 Lord Justice Clerk Miller, said: t \"I think it has a look of tf Aberdeen.\" But for many it pro. p vided the formative experience of a lifetime and it was understand- able, as Mr. Skinner observes, that the eighteenth century \"saw the d transportation to Scotland of the idea of the Italian Palace, and a liopetoun or Chatelherault owe their existence to this inspiration.\" r Many Scots bought works of ti art in Italy and a number sat for a Pompeo Batoni, the Sargent of p his day, in Rome. The exhibition contains no fewer than four examples of his work; the most d striking is the handsome portrait of Colonel William Gordon S dramatically posed in Highland a dress before the Colosseum. One I ti e d- ata id VO of in ar st id Me Empress Catherine of Russia and the Duke of Northumberland. It was typical of the breadth of interests of these artistic-middlemen that Byres was not only a dealer and antiquary but an archaeolo- gist, whose special study was Etruscan antiquity. Morison, for his part, was a friend of Winckel- mann, the theorist of neo- classicism. The most important Scottish resident in Rome, how- ever, was Gavin Hamilton, painter, dealer and archaeologist. He became a member of the Academy of St. Luke and of the Arcadians. It is now clear that his early neo- clansical paintings ante-date the pictures in this style of Mengs and that he made a major contribution to this influential international mneo-alassical movement. The ntost gifted Scottish painter to profit from a long stay in Rome was Allan Ramsay. He spent a formative period under Vleughels, the friend of Watteau, at the French Academy in Rome, saying that it was there \"alone that youth can profit in a study of the fine arts.\" The group of drawings in the exhibition underline is debt to French technique. One of his circle on his later visit to Italy in 1754 was Robert Adam. i- The exhibition also reminds us of the work of Jacob More, who d was patronised by Prince Borghese te That excellent judge of Old Mas I: tgrs, James Irvine, considered hir fto be the \"nearest to Claude of any o- painter I know.\" A number of fa painters were sent to Italy by the dFoulis Academy, but this contin at gent did not include any men ol le distinction.

   "text_content" : "It tragic hat It st be so, but ampane Golf by Tony Lem. Cssell, 25s), publiaed shortly b- e his death, is in many ways a most fitting pitaph to this great American golfer. Obviously conm led from tape recordings, one assumes by Gwilym S. Brown, who co-operated with him on his pre ious equally entertaining but astly different book The Inside Story of the Professional Tour, it reveals much of Lema's charm, good humour and a commonsense attitude to the game he graced and that in turn was kind to him. Particularly hilarious and notably irreverent is Lema's potted history of golf-\" a wee drop of history with which he started the book. Such passages as \"Actually, I suppose the first slice in history was played by some Assyrian shepherd boy who got tired of counting mutton and took a swipe at a stone with his crook. But it remained for some unsung Scots shepherd to bore a couple of target holes in the barren moor, substitute a more resilient object for the stone -perhaps a crudely rounded block of wood-and utter the first 'Oh, dom! ' over a missed putt \"-which might raise an eyebrow or two at the Royal and Ancient but many a chuckle elsewhere. The instructional passages are just as amusing, but the humour never obscures Lema's message-- to keep the game simple. And instead of ploughing through many boring chapters of bigoted, pseudo- scientific jargon so common in most golfing textbooks, it is a joy to read such lucid and sensible advice. For instance, having listed the unique features of his own swing, Lema says: \"I wouldn't recom- mend that you model your game on anyone's. But the fact that I've had some degree of success with a style and method that is my own suggests that it's worth examining very closely. Behind the style has to be a fundamental logic in the swing. The exag- gerated firmness of my left arm, for example, is ideally suited to my physical structure-and blends into the pattern of my swing. For you, such an exaggeration may not be suitable at all.\" Lema's insistence on an utterly rigid and locked left arm is as controversial as is his advice to Â£I play all shots off the left heel to avoid complicating the game. And I find it difficult to follow the eighth of his ten commandments, which asserts: \" Just before impact, the left hand and wrist- supported by the braced left side -brake to a stop. This sets up a wall of resistance for the right hand to whiplash the clubbead through the ball. The effect is to cause the head and trunk to recoil and follow in behind the shot.\" If this book has a fault, It lies in some of the action photographs which were posed against a back. ground of ragged fir trees, and are none too easy to follow. Some, too, are out of focus. But I'm happy t to think the book is a fitting and lasting memorial to the man. In its own very different style Esquire's World of Golf, edited by the veteran American golf writer Herb Graffis (Muller, 36s), is a minor masterpiece. Although angled primarily at the American market, it becomes almost more interesting to golfers in this country because it gives such an accurate insight into the transatlantic game. No aspect of golf is omitted, and the final chapter about various types of handicapping systems, forms of golf tournaments and club competitions is most enlightening. Walter Hagen. Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, and Paul Gallico make their own special contributions and Lealand Gustavson's drawings are beautifully reproduced. Dunlop's Golfers' Guide (Golf World, 7s 6d) is an excellent book- let-the first of a series. It gives' details of 100 golf clubs in the SWest Country, Channel Islands, SScilly Isles and Isle of Wight A whole page is devoted to each I club-how to reach it, green fees, hotels in the district, card of the course, and the relevant section of Sthe Ordnance Survey map, with Sthe exact location of the club i clearly indicated.",

   "text_content" : "Two first performances and a concert in a new hall are in the 966-67 programme of the London Bach Society, which continues its policy of combining modern, par tcularly British', music with uthentic Bach performances. The society will sing Bach motets at the Aldeburgh Festival's Bach Veekend at Long Melford, Suffolk, his month and will then return o the capital to resume its 20-year project of presenting Bach's 200 church cantatas, which is now in ts eighth season. Cantatas will be performed on Saturday, October 22, Tuesday, December 13, and during he St. Pancras Festival next March. The annual performance of the Matthius-Passion will be in a new setting for the society, the City Temple, on Saturday, February 18. Next March the Elizabeth Hall will open beside the Festival Hall, with a capacity for about 1,000. and the London Bach Society will be among the first choirs to sing in it. The virtuoso choral work chosen for the occasion is Bach's Mass in B minor, which will be given on June 3. The two premibres are of Cain and Abel, a dramatic cantata by John Tavener (October 22) and Benedicite by Peter Hutchings :March 3).",
