   "article_dc_title" : "Smith Gives Pledge on Income Tax Levels",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor THE FIRMEST guarantee yet that a future Labour govern- ment. would not increase the income tax bill of anyone earn- ing less than Â£20,000 a year has been given by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor. In an interview with the Financial Timies ahead of next week's party conference in Brighton, Mr Smith also gave an unequivocal pledge that he would not accept any devalua- tion of sterling in the Euro- pean Exchange Rate Mecha- nism (ERM). Asked if there were any cir- cumstances - including ster- ling's eventual move from the present wide to the narrow bands of the ERM - in which he would change its central rate of DM2.95 he replied: \"It is quite clear and quite specific. We are not going to change the rate.\" Mr Smith dismissed as \"ludi- crous\" any suggestion that recent opinion polls showing him the most popular of Labour's front bench team might prompt him to challenge Mr Neil Kinnock before the general election. Speaking against the back- ground of another Conserva- tive onslaught this week on Labour's economic policies, he rejected any suggestion that its plans for high public spending would push up the income tax bills of most taxpayers. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said earlier this week that Labour would have to put up the basic rate of tax by 10p if it were to meet various promises amounting to Â£35bn in extra public spend- ing. Mr Smith confirmed Labour's plans to replace the present 25p and 40p rates of income tax with a series of new bands running from below 20p to a 50p top rate. It would also abolish the present Â£20,280 a year earnings ceiling on National Insurance Contribu- tions (NICs). Labour has said in the past that the new system would not involve increases in the bills of the around 20m taxpayers whose earnings are below the NICs ceiling. The people who Labour takes 3-point lead in opinion poll; The ltest opinion poal gvin Labour a three-point lead over the Tories, puts a further damper on the Ilkellhood of a November election, though the Tories are determined to keep all thir options open. The survey, by NOP for th Independent newspaper and BBC Newsnlghl, Is the third In a row to put Labour In lth load, and shows the party on 42 per cent, the Tories on 39 per cent and the Liberal Demn- ocrats on 14 per cent. Last weekend's MorI poll put Labour at 43 per cent and the Tortes on 39 per cent. would pay more to finance higher pensions and child ben- efit were the 3m whose income was above that level. But Mr Smith went further in the interview by offering an explicit guarantee that what- ever the thresholds and rates applied in the banding system no one with an income of. less than Â£20,280 would face higher bills. \"It is quite clear that people earning below the upper limit for NICs will not pay any in- creased income tax under a Labour government\", he said. Asked if that amounted to a guarantee, he replied: \"That's right.\" e promise means that if inyividuah in that category f6&nd par.-of their income taxed at, say 30p or 35p rather than 25p, all their louses would have to be offset by a starting rate of below 25p. Mr Smith made it clear that, although he would like to move eventually to a starting rate of less than 20 per cent, the cost meant that was not a realistic short-term target. Initially, therefore, the new structure would involve bands running from 20 to 50 per cent. Untaxing arithmetic, Page 9 Dialectical politics, Page 19",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston BRITISH Aerospace will con- continue to pay Sir Roland Smith substantial consultancy fees, likely to be Â£300,000 a year, until May 1993, even though he has been ousted from the chairmanship of the automotive and aerospace group. He will not receive any com- pensation or advance pay- ments, according to one of the company's advisers. However, he will continue as a consul- tant to the company. \"None of his existing financial arrange- ments with BAe will change\", the adviser said. He added that it was not clear whether Sir Roland would provide any ser- vices to the company in return for the remuneration. In 1990, Sir Roland earned Â£313,000. Included in this were Â£300,000 in consultancy fees which were paid to Sir Roland's company, Roland Smith and Associates, in res- pect \"of the services Professor Smith rendered as chairman\". Sir Roland's resignaton was confirmed formally at mid- SEdiorial Commnt; 1 In search f a guidance system, Page 18 I Bloody bale in Ie boedroom, Page 19 SLex, Page 20 night on Wednesday night, c after day-long negotiations I with the rest of the board. He a will be replaced, temporarily, t by Sir Graham Day, who has I been chairman of Rover, BAe's % car manufacturing subsidiary. t Asked how long Sir Graham would keep the job, an adviser a said \"We cannot rush the c search for a chairman.\" I Sir Roland's departure came i as a result of pressure from c non-executive directors, in the i wake of a rights issue and a I warning from the company a that its profits would be half what the City had been expect- i did not hold him res- ponsible for the cop in I profits, but felt his m age- ment style - in particular his t zeal for takeovers - was no longer appropriate in a reces- sion. \"It became obvious two weeks ago that the board was against him,\" said one of Sir Roland's friends yesterday. The board's conviction that Sir Roland should go was stiffened on Sunday, when two newspa- pers carried reports of attempts to oust him. Until then, it was likely that Sir Roland would have stayed until after the completion of the rights issue. But the board and its advis- ers became convinced reports of a boardroom split would lead to a collapse in BAe's share price. They were con- cerned that shareholders would not take up their rights, leaving the new shares with underwriters. BAe shares yesterday edged up 3p to 428p, remaining only 48p above the rights issue price of 380p. Although the rights issue is fully underwritten, it remained uncertain whether the issue would be a suocess.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey, East Europe Correspondent, in Zagreb and Router in Bucharest Rioting Romanian miners demanding the resignation of President Ion lmescu break through a cordon of armed police outside the government headquarters in Bucharest ROMANIA was sliding into anarchy last night as thou- sands of miners and civilians ransacked parliament and attacked the main television station in the capital, Buchar- est, with petrol bombs. As the violence spread, the govenpent Innounced the deploynumtbf troops nation- wide and the distribution of live ammunition. Mr Petre Roman, the prime minister, who had resigned earlier in the day, reversed his decision and pledged to defend the country against what he called a communist-inspired coup. Last night one western diplo- mat said: \"The city is in tur- moil. We could be heading towards anarchy.\" The rapid deterioration in Bucharest followed two days of rioting and attacks on govern- ment buildings by miners demanding better social and working conditions. The flare-up was ostensibly sparked by rocketing prices and dwind- ling wages caused by market economy reforms which Mr Roman has inptroduced in a turpabout Afrom four decades of communist centralism. Yesterday's viblence erupted after troops ringed the govern- ment headquarters with armoured vehicles fltte with heavy machine-gunms. Some 7,000 miners began marching to the building in central Vic- tory Square. They demanded the resignation of Mr Roman, prime minister since May 1990, and President Ion Illescu, who in June last year had called on the miners to quash anti-gov- ernment demonstrations. Civilian mobs yesterday joined the miners, who then converged on the parliament building overlooking the city. Thousands besieged and stoned the 19th-century build- ing, smashing furniture and throwing it into the street Other crowds, some iu trucks and many armed with clubs or waving flags, headed for the television centre on the other side of town. The latest rioktJOpowed the deaths of four people on Wednesday in clashs between security forces and miners backed by Bucharest citizens. Earlier yesterday Mr fnescu had met miners' leaders in what was seen as an attempt to distance himself from Mr Roman's economic reforms. The president announced he had started talks on the cre- ation of a government of national unity. Last night, in an interview with French television, Mr Roman said \"What we have Contiruned o Page 20 Romania Continuda m Pae I seen was a movement which turned into a coup d'etat.. a kind of communist putsch. As long as law and order are not restored, I maintain my duties as prime minister and my min- isters will remain too.\" His comments were contra- dicted, however, by an aca- demic who aid \"The country is not being taken over the communists. It is being taken over by right-wing nationalists who, if they succeed, will bury democracy.\" It remains unclear if Mr Roman can rely on the armed forces to regain order. If not, diplomats said, the political vacuum would be quickly filled by right-wing nationalists. Mr Miron Cosma, leader of the miners who hijacked trains to Bucharest from the western Jiu Valley on Wednesday, told the men yesterday their demands had been met and they should go home. They appeared to Ignore his request. Some 52000 coalmine from west Romania's JiA Valley coal field have been on strike since Tuesday demanding a price heeme and pay ries.",

   "text_content" : "By Usa Wood, Labour Staff A CONFIDENTIAL plan to abolish National Health Ser- vice pay review bodies by April 1994 looks set to place the gov- ernment on a collision course with Britain's 489,000 nurses. The plan, discussed by senior Whitehall officials at a meeting with regional NHS managers, is politically contro- versial because it would mean the end of national pay rates which have helped raise the level of nurses' salaries. Last night Downing Street rejected the suggestions that pay review bodies would phased out. According to minutes of a strategy meeting of regional personnel directors on July 25 in Edinburgh, discussion about how to accelerate the phasing out of pay review bodies was led by Mr Eric Caines and Mr Peter Johnson, members of the NHS management executive, the service's management board. On the devolution of pay and conditions to the local level, the memo states that adequate warning should be given to the service that \"the ultimate aim is total devolution\". In practice this would mean the end of national pay rates. The civil servants' agenda for the devolution of pay and conditions for nurses to the new NHS hospital trusts con- tradicts government state- ments. Mr William Walde- grave, health secretary, told the annual congress of the Royal College of Nursing in May that \"the pay review body is safe\". Miss Christine Hancock, gen- eral secretary of the RCN, who shared the platform with Mr Waldegrave, said yesterday she was to seek \"his personal reas- surance on the matter\". She said: \"At this year's RCN congress William Walde- grave was explicit about that commitment. It would seem that his civil servants have a different agenda.\" The Department of Health said: \"The secretary of state has made it clear that the nurses' pay review body is safe but because of changes in the NHS it may well be that there will be some changes.\" A Downing Street official said \"I am not aware of any plans to abolish the nurses' or any other pay review body.\" Further rows about NHS Continued on Page 20 Receiver for NHS body, Page 8 NHS pay bodies to be axed c..tt.r. fp... changes would be unwelcome by the government, with the Labour party set to exploit problems about reforms in the run-up to the election. The nurses' union warned that complete devolution could lead to pay anarchy. An official said the nurses' pay review body had been set up in 198I to avoid idustrial disputes. The body has been mportant in the ihprveenot f pay. e de~oluti phn p is likely to fuel ontroe y bout wether the new S trusts are pat of the NHS. Miss ancock haus said that if the new NHS trusts, which are able to opt out of NHS terms for pay and conditions, followed the recommendations of the pay review body, it meant they were part of the NHS. If they did not, they were outside it. Ime hospital trusts, of which there are 57, have the right to break from national pay and conditions for new employees but most have not done so. Ime plan, a outined in the confidential memorandum, leaked by the RCN, said: \"Given political restraints com- plete devolution is still desired for all bodies [including the pay review bodies]. This devo- lution should be achieved in totality by April 1994 to coin- cide with the fourth wave of trusts [which should mean that the majority of units will have gone to trust status]. This will leave two years of pay rounds and negtiations\" aDeoluoncould mean that some form of pay review body could continue to exist without any authority, with rates set by local negotiators.",

   "text_content" : "By NMll Buckley in Tbilisi OPPOSITION troops in Georgia ignored a government-hnposed deadline to hand over their arms last night, leaving the capital, Tbilisi, again on the brink of armed conflict. Rebel national guardsmen prepared for a possible govern- ment attack on their strong- hold in the television centre, positioning a howitzer at the top of the wide approach road, and blocking it with buses and lorries. Pro-government guardsmen and special troops began to leave their temporary base in the courtyard of the main gov- ernment building for an undis- closed destination. Roadblocks were set up by government troops on all roads leading to the TV centre, checking vehicles for arms. President Zviad Gamsakhur- dia warned that measures would be taken against oppo- nents who refused to hand over their weapons. Speaking shortly before the deadline passed, Mr Gamsakhurdia said: \"We will try to avoid blood- shed. But this is terrorism, and you know what terrorism means. \"We will use the methods all governments must use to fight terrorism.\" A government spokesman was evasive about whether the opposition headquarters in Georgia's television centre would be stormed, but said he did not believe Mr Gamsakhur- dia was preparing to give such an order. He was confident that the majority of the opposition, which was beset by internal divisions, would hand over its arms. At the television centre, there was little evidence of a split in the opposition, as a crowd of around 4,000 people demonstrated their support. Earlier, Mr Tengiz Kitovani, commander of rebel national guard units, claimed govern- ment troops had tried to attack the guard's base at Shavna- bada, just outside Tbilisi, in the early hours, but had been driven back. Three people were said to have been killed. The government denied the allegation, and the city's only mortuary said it had received no bodies. The government in turn accused the opposition of sev- eral acts, including firing on Mr Gamsakhurdia's residence. Mark Nicholson adds from Moscow: At least three people have died in clashes in the dis- puted enclave of Nagorno- Karabakh since the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to call a ceasefire in the region and start peace talks. The violent exchanges, which include stonings, shoot- ings and the shelling of Stepan- akert, capital of the disputed territory, highlight the difficul- ties faced by the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan in enforcing the ceasefire bro- kered earlier this week by Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of Rus- sia. Tass, the news agency, reported that two Armenians were shot dead near Stepanak- ert on Wednesday by forces it' described as Azerbaljanis in: military uniforms. Armenian groups responded by overturning a bus on the road south from Stepanakert to Shusha, an Azerbaijani village in the predominantly Arme- nian Nagorno-Karabakh. An Azerbaijani inspector who visited the scene was later shot and killed when Arme- nian groups fired and threw grenades at his car, three other Azerbaljanis were wounded. Sporadic shooting was reported to have continued in the region throughout the rest of the evening, and at least eight shells were fired from Shusha into Stepanakert dur- ing the late evening. One of these was reported to have hit a children's hospital and injured a young girl.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0927_0002_002",
   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson in Moscow MSR Eduard Shevaranadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, has agreed to join a new coun- cil of advisers to President Mikhail Gorbachev to oppose the continued \"menace\" from hardline forces in the country. Mr Shevardnadze, who accused Mr Gorbachev of cul- pable negligence over last month's failed coup, said he now believed the Soviet presi- dent was \"vigorously\" commit- ted to radical reform and con- sidered his own appointment to the new Presidential Consultative Council a \"high honour\". The nine-member body, which Mr Gorbachev named late on Wednesday, is a mix of radical reformers and long- lime Gorbachev allies and, although its precise briet remains unclear, is designed to shore up the executive power of the presidency. Among the nine are five founder members of the Demo- cratic Reform Movement, including Mr Shevardnadze, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, one of the architects of perestroika, Mr Gavriil Popov, the mayor of Moscow, and Mr Anatoly Sob- chak, mayor of St Petersburg. The council also includes several democratic leaders close to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and is seen by many as both a bridge between the Kremlin and the Russian \"White House\" and an attempt by Mr Gorbachev to identify himself more closely with the leading forces of reform. Mr Shevardnadze told Tass, the news agency, yesterday that he saw it as his duty to join other reformists on the new council in helping stabi- lise the country. \"The menace has not been removed,\" he said. \"It is mounting. There is danger that the positions of the right-wing, reactionary forces will strengthen.\" Mr Shevardnadze's first role is to head a delegation to nego tiate with Lithuania on the terms of the Baltic state's residual ties with Moscow and Lithuania yesterday welcomed his appointment. Mr Gorbachev also named Mr Sobchak and Mr Yakovlev as special envoys respectively to Estonia and Latvia to start negotiations - so far the new council's only defined task. Anthony Robinson adds: The most vocal advocates of democ- racy before the abortive Soviet coup have been forced to re-es- tablish new forms of direct executive power to forestall the risk of an authoritarian back- lash provoked by the ungov- ernable situation and economic collapse, a senior Soviet politi- cal analyst, Mr Andranik Mig- ranian, told the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Lon- don yesterday. The decision by Mr Boris Yeltsin to emulate Czarist practice and directly appoint \"prefects\" to act as his eyes and ears in the big cities and far-flung provinces, and the more authoritarian positions taken by the mayors of Moscow and St Petersburg, were all part of this trend.",

Industrial production dropped 0.1% in the January-March quarter from the previous quarter, after peak growth of 2.2% in the July-September quarter of 1990. This represents the first quarter- ly fall in well over a year, since the July- September quarter of 1989. For the April- June quarter of 1991, industrial out- put fell by a sharper 0.6% from the pre- ceding quarter. A year-to-year compar- ison reveals that growth in industrial production slowed to 3.1% for the April- June quarter of 1991, from a peak of 7.1% for the October-December quar- terof 1990. Lokingatyear-to-yeargrowth by sectors, growth in all sectors slowed in the April-June quarter. The sluggish growth apparently reflects a further slow- ing of export growth, housing invest- ment and capital investment. Under these circumstances, the in- Figure 1.

This in- dicates pressure for inventory adjust- ment is rapidly increasing. The cut in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan on July 1 can there- fore be interpreted as a measure taken for fear that the economic slowdown could develop into a staff. Figure 2.

Al am n a yW40 -teyar, an Source The MWialy of Finance Regurging Trade Surpl!u In addition to the fear of a stall, the Japanese economy also confronts an- other source of concern - the resurgence of trade friction with other countries. Japan's trade surplus began expand- ing again this year, after steadily dwin- dling through last year. On a customs clearance basis, the trade surplus for the first half of 1991 increased by $7 bil- lion from a year earlier (after expanding to $32.3 billion in the first half of 1991, from $25.6 billion in the first half of 1990). By region (Figure 2), the trade surplus with the United States decreased, main- ly because the nation's economic slow- down dampened Japan's export growth to the country. In contrast, the surplus- es with Western Europe and the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of Asia expanded The trade surpluswith Western Europe shrank until the first halfof 1990, while Japan has had few trade disputes with the Asian NIEs. This recent trend stirs concern that trade friction could break out in these regions. The expanded trade surplus for the first half of 1991 stemmed largely from a temporary factor - the yen's year-to- year appreciation against the U.S. dol- lar. The higher yen pushed up the yen- denominated portion ofepots, increasing the value ofoverall exports In the mean- time, growth in import volume decel- erated, due mainly to Japan's econom- ic slowdown, which restricted reduction in the trade surplus* (Figure 2). For the second half of 1991, the in- fluence of the so-called \"J-curve effect\" will all but disappear, assuming that the dollar continues to hover near 138.01 yen (the average exchange rate for July, against 138.02 yen for the second half of 1990). However, lower crude oil import prices ($26.13 per barrel in the second half of1990; $18.03 in July) are likely to help boost Japan's trade surplus. A close watch on the trade surplus seems necessary for the time being. * Thina issinebullorbis n@elofemn fw olepoest rpele hewq wee bo duse- in stmysuweM an.

   "text_content" : "By Ronald van de Krol in The Hague Croatian militiamen who have been involved in continual clashes with Serbian forces for the past few days around the town of Bilaj LORD Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference in The Hague, said yesterday he would accelerate efforts to strengthen the ceasefire. The conference, meeting for the first time since it was adjourned last week because of heavy fighting in Croatia, is to set up working groups - on constitutional matters, minor- ity rights and economic rela- tions between the republics. Lord Carrington said there were now \"hopeful signs\" of improvements on the ground. \"The ceasefire, though fragile, seems to be holding,\" he said after two hours of talks with the foreign ministers of the six Yugoslav republics and the Yugoslav foreign minister. Starting next week, the working groups are to meet in nearly permanent session in The Hague. Two previous groups on human rights and constitutional matters had met only sporadically. \"We came to the conclusion that the ceasefire was holding sufficiently for us to go on with the conference and to accelerate it in so far as it is possible to do so,\" he said. \"We believe that by making progress - if we can make progress - we think it will be more likely that the ceasefire will hold and that we can get a solution that is acceptable to all the parties to the dispute.\" The new working group on economics will examine whether there should be a cen ral bank or a monetary union among the six republics once hey have settled their differ ences and agreed on a future ramework for their political relations. The three groups will be chaired by officials from the European Commission, which has been trying to broker a peace agreement in Yugoslavia since July. They are expected to identify problems and issues to be put before a special arbitration commission consisting of five eminent European constitu- tional lawyers. Lord Carrington said minor- ity groups in Yugoslavia, while unable to take part directly in The Hague conference, would be heard by his two deputy chairmen, who will then report back. * Groups such as the Alba- nians in Yugoslavia had com- plained bitterly about being shut out of the conference. * The Yugoslav federal army yesterday agreed to withdraw some of its reservists from Bos- nia-Hercegovina, a move which should ease tension between Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the central republic, write Judy Dempsey in Zagreb and Laura Silber in Belgrade. Bosnian officials had feared that the pro-Serb federal army intended to lay the foundations of a Greater Serbia by carving territory out of Bosnia-Her- cegovina. The Bosnian government has agreed to lift blockades of fed- eral army units in return for the withdrawal of the reserv- ists. Despite the army with- drawal, reports persisted in Helgrade of a planned mass mobilisation. The reports have prompted thousands of men to go into hiding or flee. In Croatia, Mr Mihailo Zar- kovic, deputy commander of the army camp at Prevlaka, near the Croatian tourist resort of Dubrovnik, said Cro- atian national guardsmen yes- terday attacked army units at Kumbor, just inside Montene- gro. Army units began withdraw- ing from Vinkovci, a Croatian town and key railroad junction 10 miles west of the border with Serbia, after a local agree- mnent between army officers and Croat security forces.",

   "text_content" : "By Chrystia Freeland in Kiev IN CONTRAST with the prevailing western view that it makes economic sense for the Soviet Union to stay together, a group of eminent foreign advisers is arguing that inde- pendence will give former Soviet republics the best shot at radical economic reform. On that premise, a high-pow- ered western team, including Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former British chancellor of the exche- quer, Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist, and Mr Rudiger Dornbusch, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology econo- mist, met Ukrainian leaders last week to begin drafting an economic reform programme. Working with a group of Ukrainian economists, led by Mr Volodyamyr Pylypchuk, head of the parliamentary com- mission on economic reform, they hope to produce a plan by the beginning of next year. The idea is to introduce a separate currency backed by price reform, a balanced bud- get and tougher budget con- straints on enterprises. A mas- sive privatisation campaign, with favourable conditions for foreign investors, would follow for an economy which accounts for one-third of Soviet agricultural production and a quarter of industrial output. Mr Soros, who made a for- tune playing the capitalist game, says: \"I think it is easier to guide the Ukraine into a democratic, market-oriented economy than it is to reform Russia because there is a uni- fying force here: they all want to break with Moscow. It is very difficult to break with Moscow in Moscow.\" Paradoxically, Moscow's own policies are creating an eco- nomic rationale for what was already a powerful emotional desire to cut ties with the cen- tre by creating a separate cur- rency. \"Yeltsin has discovered the printing press. He may well be setting a world record for the creation of money,\" said Prof Dornbusch. Most of those new banknotes stay in Russia: Ukrainian banks have received only 19 per cent of their cash needs this month and are pay- ing wages with up to 12 days' delay. But new-found independence can bring its own economic perils. The Ukrainian cabinet is more intent on bringing the economy under its own control than on leaving it to the mar- ket. Enterprises ranging from Donbass coalmines to collec- tive farms have been forbidden to make barter deals with part- ners outside the republic, while the Ukrainian National Bank, which has long com- plained about the Kremlin's monopoly on hard currency, is trying to take over all hard currency accounts held in Ukrainian commercial banks. \"Kiev wants to replace Moscow,\" complains Mr Volo- dymyr Slednev, director of a mammoth metallurgical com- plex in eastern Ukraine. The parliament is a poor counterweight to a reactionary cabinet. Its chairman, Mr Leo- nid Kravchuk, is a sort of Ukrainian Gorbachev - a bril- liant compromiser and media- tor. But, like the Soviet presi- dent, he is unable to provide the decisive leadership needed in the aftermath of the failed coup. The nationalist opposition which controls parliament is reluctant to attack Mr Krav- chuk. It does not want to anta- gonise him or the Ukraine's 3.5m other ex-Communists because it needs their co-opera- tion to guarantee a \"yes\" vote in the December 1 referendum on independence. On the campaign trail, Mr Kravchuk has demonstrated a firmer grasp of what the public wants to hear than what it should be told about economic reform. He is persuading vot. ers to cast their ballots for independence with the promise that in a sovereign Ukraine prices will be lowered. That is a very different sce- nario from the radical reforms planned by Mr Pylypchuk and his western advisers, which would mean belt-tightening, fiscal discipline and higher prices.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Cane in Venice EUROPE'S ailing computer manufacturing companies yes- terday called for action from Brussels to ensure the survival of a significant European infor- mation technology industry. The chief executives of Groupe Bull of France, Olivetti of Italy and Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany united at a confer- ence in Venice to complain they were at a disadvantage compared with US and Japa- nese competitors; these enjoyed a strong home market and co-operation between the public sector and computer industry. In these countries, they said, more than 90 per cent of public contracts routinely went to domestic companies. In Europe, European-owned com- panies had only a 30 per cent share of the market for public sector computer projects. Unless European computer companies could build a more sympathetic relationship with the public authorities in the unified European market after 1992 the outlook was bleak, they warned. Mr Francis Lorentz, chair- man of Groupe Bull, said he was not looking for protection or for fortifications around Europe but for a coherent pol- icy from Brussels that would leave no doubt of the indus- try's Importance. Among other measures, they seek involvement at an early stage in the planning of Europe-wide information tech- nology projects which would give them a powerful opportu- nity to secure final contracts. Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, chief executive of Siemens-Nixdorf, said: \"If European suppliers are chosen as partners in cases when they meet the demand with technically suitable prod- ucts, the chances are good for Europe to deal with the chal- lenges of the 1990s.\" The worldwide computer industry is in crisis through technological change and recession but Europe's manu- facturers, with their small, het- erogeneous markets, have been hit particularly hard and all are losing money. The Venice accord was spoiled by a behind-the-scenes row which indicates the resent- ment simmering over the sale of Britain's ICL to Fujitsu of Japan last year. The UK-based company is seen by some Euro- pean manufacturers as a Japa- nese Trojan horse, although ICL has made it clear it regards itself as a European company with a Japanese majority shareholder. The conference organisers had planned a roundtable dis- cussion including Mr Peter Bonfeld, ICL chairman. That was abandoned in favour of individual presentations after the European-owned manufac- turers threatened to boycott the conference. Mr Bonfield's presentation - in which he made the case for a strong European home mar- ket - was moved to a session with speakers from Digital Equipment and International Business Machines of the US. Mr Lorentz pointedly included ICL among Japanese compa- nies with which Groupe Bull had collaborative agreements. Mr Vittorio Cassoni, 011- vetti's managing director, referring to Europe's weakness in computer technology, said the Commission should not spend money trying to catch trains that Europe had already missed. Europe could still base a successful information tech- nology industry on software and services which in 1990 was a $40bn business in Europe. Mr Michel Carpentier, EC director general for the infor- mation technology industries, said the Commission was nego- tiating with Japan and the US to achieve a better competitive environment.",

   "text_content" : "Germany's inflation eases amid pay fears By Christopher Parkes in Bonn THE upward trend in the west German cost of living index weakened in September, but early indications from the annual pay round suggest that Bundesbank warnings about the infla- tionary dangers of a pay-and-prices spiral may be ignored. Prices were 3.9 per cent higher than in September last year, following a 4.1 per cent increase in August, according to prelimi- nary figures released by the government statistics office yester- day. The Deutsche Bank said it expected a further deceleration in price rises during October, and an overall increase in the cost of living index for the year of 3.5 per cent. However, news of a 6.5 per cent pay increase for 220,000 insurance and banking workers, and rumblings from the indus- trial front are giving cause for concern. Construction companies, for example, enjoying a building boom in east and west Ger- many, expect to face union demands for pay and working hours parity with metal and chemical industry workers. Renault seeks aid for job cuts Renault is to seek aid from the government and the European Commission for job creation schemes following heavy cuts in its workforce, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The French car group-says it must lose thousands of workers to face the increased Japanese competition resulting from the recent car import accord between Brussels and Tokyo. France's bilateral accord with Tokyo limiting Japanese imports to 3 per cent of the French market would disappear by 1993, along with bilateral curbs by four other member states. Mr Raymond Levy, Renault's chairman, believes Renault needs to cut its workforce by 40 per cent to bring productivity to Japanese levels. Renault says there are no formal plans to make job cuts on that scale although it will lose 4,620 jobs this year. This would bring the payroll to 83,128 by December. French unemployment falls Unemployment in France fell slightly last month for the first time in a year, bringing the total to 2.75m or 9.5 per cent. Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister, warned that this was because of seasonal declines in the number of young people seeking jobs and in the number of redundancies. She expected a rise in young job seekers this month. Unemployment is causing growing concern to the government, which has reacted with measures to support small business and encourage apprentice- ship. Overall, the unemployment rate stayed at 9.5 per cent last month, the same as in July. EC staff vote to strike European Community civil servants voted overwhelmingly for a two-day strike next week after pay talks collapsed, union offl- clals said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The decision was taken at a meeting representing about 25,000 EC employees. A union official said: \"We strike on Wednesday and Thursday and there could be a series of other sectoral strikes... This could go on for months.\" Staff in Brussels, Luxembourg and other parts of the Commu- nity staged several strikes last June and July, fighting attempts by EC capitals to peg their relatively high salaries closer to the pay of national civil servants. The Netherlands, currently chairing the Community, wants to keep a 7.6 per cent levy on salaries imposed during a recession in 1981 and they now want the right to increase the levy if necessary, the union official said. Irish petrol price control move Petrol price controls are to be lifted in Ireland from October 1, the Department of Industry and Commerce said, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. This follows complaints from petrol distribu- tors that margins have shrunk considerably since the last mar- gin increase of 6 per cent six years ago. Four-star petrol costs around 62 Irish pence (57 pence) per litre, about 20 per cent higher than in the UK. Industry sources say prices could rise by as much as 4 Irish pence.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardnr in Brussels THE European Commission's proposed energy tax would raise Ecu58.5bn (t37.55bn) according to a preliminary cal- culation by the Commission's energy directorate. The' tax, proposed on Wednesday, aims to reduce emissions of reenho ses which contribute to i bal warming. The tax receipts, which would be colected nationally and offset by tuts in other taxes under the Brussels an, would come overhelm- from the most industria- parts of the EC. The poorer, southern mem- ber states, which had been con- verned that the proposed tax would stunt their industrial development, would have to adjust their tax systems by smaller than average amounts, both per capita and as a per- centage of national output. The brunt of the taxation switch would fall on the richer countries. Yet it was partly because of concern that some of these northern members, mainly. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, would go ahead and introduce similar taxes, that the Commission felt compelled to act. Brussels feared that unilateral action would create distortions in the EC's single market and under- mine a common environmental policy. The tax proposed is a mixed levy falling halfon fossil fuels according to caibon content, and half on all other forms of non-renewable energy. Brus- sels would like to start it at the equivalent of $3 on a barrel of oil in 1993, rising $1 a year to reach $10 by 2000. Energy intensive industries like steel, chemicals, nop-fer- rous metals, cement, glass, paper and packaging would be virtually exempt from the tax unless the EC's main trading partners adopted a similar regime. The Commission's calcula- tions were based on a differ- ently mixed levy - with 25 per cent on carbon fuels and 75 per cent on other forms of energy - so that the position of heavy coal consumers like Spain, for instance, would be worse than its figures suggest. Of the Ecu53.5bn receipts, Ecul7.6bn would be raised by Germany, EculO.Ibn by the UK, and just over Ecu7bn each by France and Italy. Spain would raise Ecu3.4bn, and Por- tugal EcuO.7bn. The per capita impact would be Ecu225 for Germany, Ecul76 for the UK, Ecul29 and Ecul22 for France and Italy, but Ecu89 and Ecu66 for Spain and Portugal. The Commission foresees that the tax's introduction would raise the cost of indus- trial coal by 61 per cent, petrol by 5.9 per cent, and natural gas by 31 per cent by 2000. These figures, however, are based on the assumption of a 25/75 mix between carbon and other energies, against the 50/50 split Brussels has now opted for.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Graham in Rome PREPARATION of thq 1992 budget is causing divisions within the Italian goverpment and could lead to early elec- tions. The budget is due to be fina- lised by September 30 but the four party Christian De4ocrat- led government of Mr Giulio Andreotti appears deadlocked over how to cut spending. Mr Andreotti has been attempting to placate the sac- tions within his government amid speculation he will have to dissolve parliament. The disagreements 'have emerged less than two months after the coalition agreed to paper over differences and see this legislature through its full five year term until June 1992. It would be the first time this has happened since the war. Changes in Italy's generous state pensions is one of the most sensitive issues under consideration. A formula was agreed in August to raise the pensionable age to 65 years from 60 for men and 55 for women. This was expected to save L18,000bn (8,249m). Pension reform has been pushed through by Mr Franco Marini, the labour minister. But the socialists in the coali- tion want merely a voluntary change in the pensionable age. Their attitude undermines the spirit, if not the value, of the pension reform. In itself this could provoke Mr Marini's resignation. With the Socialists reluctant to proceed with pen- sion reform, this in turn.com- plicates the government's task of devising a budget which sat- isfies all coalition partners and tackles the budget deficit. The budget deficit for 1991 is expec- ted to be closer to L150,000bn than the L127,000bn forecast. This is over 10.5 per cent of GDP, and is virtually all accounted for by debt service payments. On Monday the OECD in its annual report on Italy warned of the dangers in failing to tackle the public sec- tor deficit. Mr Andreotti is attempting to both boost revenues and cut spending with a weak hand. Behind the battle over the budget lies the issue of Italy's ability to carry out structural economic reform to bring it into line with its main Euro- pean partners for 1992 and the next phase of monetary union. If the cabinet ducks the reforms now, they will have to be confronted after next year's elections. weak hand",

   "text_content" : "By Stsfan Wagelyl in Tokyo JAPAN'S finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, has bowed to pressure from the ruling Liberal Democratic party and decided to resign to take responsibility for the country's fnancial scandals. Mr Hashimoto has told senior party officials he will resign after he returns on 3ctober 17 from a visit to Bangkok for the International Monetary Fund's annual meet ing and a gathering of minis ters from the Group of Seven industrialised countries. Mr Hashimoto's departure is unlikely to influence Japan's international financial polcy- making, but it will deprive the Finance Ministry of a powerful spokesman in domestic politl- cal arguments. He will quit shortly before the expiry of Mr Toshiki Kai- fu's current term as LDP presi- dent and prime minister and the dissolution of the present cabinet. Mr Kalfu will tempo. rarily serve as finance minister as well as prime minister until the LDP chooses a new leader on October 27. Mr Hashimoto declined to comment yesterday on his res- ignation plans. which were leaked by LDP oMicals. Some LDP members are angry that he has stayed in office as long as he has. Mr Hashimoto first indicated in early August that he would resign to take respon- sibility for scaodals involving banks and stockbrokers and for the involvement of his top aide in an illegal loans scheme. He said then he would remain in office to supervise the passage through the Diet (narnament) of securities law reform bills; designed to counter some of the abuses revealed. These bills seem cer- tain to be passed by the time the Diet ends on October 4. By staying in office, Mr Hash imoto ensures that Japan will be represented by an expe- rienced -finance minister in Basgkgk - as well as securing for himself some favourable publicity.

   "text_content" : "By Lamis Andoni in Algiers and Hugh Carnmegy in Jerusalem TWO Palestinian leaders from the Israeli-occupied territories, risking retaliation by Israel, yesterday urged Palestinian exiles meeting in Algiers to go along with a US-sponsored Middle East peace conference. Mr Faisal Husseini and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi addressed the Palestine National Council, the parliament-in-exile, behind closed doors before leaving for the US, said Palestine Libera- tion Organisation officials. Israel said yesterday it would take action against the two under its anti-terrorist laws it was shown they had taken part in the PNC meeting. Mr James Baker, US secre- tary of state, has repeatedly met Mr Husseini and Mrs Ash- rawi in an attempt to convene an October peace conference. An Israeli decision to arrest them would probably make his task much more difficult. \"Measures will be taken against them as dictated by the law,\" the Israeli defence minis- try said in a statement. \"Par- ticipation in the PNC discus- sions constitutes taking part in a terrorist organisation which only recently tried to send murder squads into Israel,\" it added, referring to the PLO, which is outlawed in Israel and the occupied territories. Senior Israeli officials strongly denied suggestions that Israel had agreed in advance with the US that it would turn a blind eye to a visit to Algiers during the PNC by the two leaders. Contact with the PLO is against the law and normally invites a jail sentence. Mr Eli- yahu Ben-Elissar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee, said he would recommend barring Mr Husseini and Mrs Ashrawi from returning home if reports President George Bush yesterday highlighted the principle of \"land for peace\" as the basis of efforts to con- vene a Middle East peace conference, George Graham reports from Washington. At a meeting with King Hassan of Morocco, Presi- dent Bush called for \"a com- prehensive peace based on United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of ter- ritory for peace\". This prin- ciple, which is not accepted by Israel, has remained offi- cial US policy, but Mr Bush has in recent months concen- trated more on the proce- dural questions surrounding a peace conference than on its terms of reference. King Hassan said his coun- try would be \"mobilised\" to achieve this peace, but he believed Israel would create problems for the process. of their visit were true. PLO officials in Algiers indi- cated that their leadership was prepared to allow Palestinians to attend the peace conference in a joint delegation with Jor- dan, provided the US provides adequate assurances that Pal- estinian demands will be addressed. Palestinian radicals have mounted a vigorous rearguard action against making any compromises, but moderates, anxious not be left out of the, peace process, are inclined to submit to Israeli insistence that no Palestinian delegates should be PLO members or res- idents of east Jerusalem. The PNC is expected to approve a resolution allowing Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and his colleagues to make the final decision. Kongo, Japan's first destroyer equipped with the US-designed Aegis ssile system, is launched at Nagasaki yesterday. At 7,200 tonnes, Kongo is the largest combat ship In the Japanese navy. _ __Â·Â· Â· aÂ· ~_ ___Â·____Â· Â· ---o-- Â·r--------~- -Â·----- -------Â· ----~- -o--- --1 -r- r",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney EIGHT YEARS to the day after he became the first non- American to win the America's Cup yacht race, Mr Alan Bond faced the future yesterday in the car park of a Perth police station. Mr Bond - the London-born signwriter who built Bond Cor- poration Holdings into one of Australia's highest profile cor- porate raiders before it crashed last year - apparently drove to the police station for protec- tion after noticing his Range Rover was being followed. However, his pursuer turned out to be a process server employed to deliver a court notice requiring Mr Bond to repay a debt of US$194m (Â£1114m) to Hongkong Bank of Australia. Officials had been searching for Mr Bond since Tuesday, when the bank filed the notice at the federal court in Sydney following a judgment that the debt was enforceable. \"Mr Bond came to the sta- tion because he was fearful - he didn't know who was fol- lowing him,\" said an oicer at suburban Nedlands police sta- tion. \"He said the guy did not introduce himself, he just threw the notice at him and said. 'Here, this is for you.'\" The officer would not con- firm suggestions that Mr Bond had claimed the process server tried to run his car off the road. Mr Bond was not available for comment, but his secretary said he had received the notice, which gives him 28 days to repay the debt or face bank- ruptcy proceedings. The serving of the notice may turn out to be one of the last acts in the saga of Mr Bond, who became a national hero on September 26 1983, when his yacht won the Amer- ica's Cup. But his financial problems mounted after the global stock markets crash in 1987, and on the same date last year he resigned as chairman of Bond Corporation. Less than two years ago, Australia's Business Review Weekly magazine estimated his personal wealth at A$100m. Now the Rolls-Royce has gone, the furniture has been sold to pay legal fees, and Mr Bond 6ves rent-free in his mansion courtesy of a trust fund. Mr Bond claims the judge misunderstood his financial position, and says he intends to appeal against the order instructing him to repay the debt Nevertheless bankruptcy proceedings seem likely to begin in a month's time. Mr Bond also faces charges of dishonesty relating to share dealing in Western Australia.",

   "text_content" : "Lionel Barber reports from New York on fresh departures for the world body RAQ dominated the open- ing of the United Nations General Assembly, just as it did a year ago after the inva- sion of Kuwait. Then, as now, the question was whether President Saddam Hussein would miscalculate and provoke the US and its allies to resort 'to force - in this case to carry out existing UN resolutions requiring the destruction of Iraq's nuclear and unconventional weapons. But beyond the tense stand- off in downtown Baghdad, where 44 UN weapons inspec- tors remained encircled by Iraqi troops, a larger issue loomed: the extent to which the international community may claim to intervene in the affairs of a member state, with the backing of the UN. This has long been a sensi- tive matter, since the UN char- ter is quite explicit in prohibit- ing such interventions unless there is a wider threat to inter- national stability. the general consensus appears to be that hauling away personnel files, company documents and pho- tographing top-secret govern- ment installations is the price Baghdad must pay. But the question which no longer remains taboo is: should the principle of multilateral intervention be extended to contain the new forces of nationalism let loose by the collapse of communism in Europe and Asia - forces which now challenge estab- lished borders, threaten human rights and jeopardise stability across the continent? Has the UN a role to play in a more ambitious form of collective security? \"This issue\", said one US official, \"is going to dominate the next decade.\" The debate came to a head on Wednesday when a French- led proposal to impose an arms embargo against Yugoslavia ran into difficulties in the UN Security Council Several non-aligned mem- bers complained privately that the move amounted to an unwarranted intrusion on the part of the UN; the problem was only finessed after Mr Budimir Loncar, the Yugoslav foreign minister, produced a letter from the Belgrade gov- ernment requesting he attend the Security Council session and take the unusual step of appealing for an arms embargo against his own country. \"Yugoslavia cannot solve its crisis on its own,\" said Mr Lon- car. \"Help Yugoslavia to find a way to help itself.\" In the event, the resolution passed unanimously - but without a provision that would enable the UN to enforce the embargo as it did with Iraq. Still, the action pushed the principle of intervention a fur- ther forward, evoking many of the sentiments expressed by US President George Bush dur- ing an expansive, if ill-defined speech last Monday. In a speech at the UN, Mr Bush said the Gulf war estab- lished a model for the collec- tive settlement of disputes; but then he went a good deal fur- ther by raising the prospect of \"international co-operation\" against internal feuds and injustices. Finally, he talked about the UN's important busi- ness of promoting the defence of \"inalienable human rights\". Having seen the way the US corralled the UN last year to provide \"political cover\" for the Gulf war to liberate Kuwait, plenty of countries are nervous about the Americans' new enthusiasm for the UN, But Mr Bush's attempt to draw up a new set of principles to deal with what Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secre- tary, called \"the end of the principle of empire\" received support in other western quar ters. Speaking on Tuesday Mr Ronald Dumas, the French for- eign minister, called for a new charter to be adopted by the international community which would give beleaguered minorities the right to request outside intervention on humanitarian grounds. Mr Dumas cited the recent example of UN intervention in northern Iraq on behalf of the Kurdish refugees. Yet as one British official remarked: although strictly a humanitar- ian operation, the UN interven tion -backed up by French, US and British armed forces was an invasion of sovereign territory in all but name. Some countries such as China and India recognise the trend - and object strongly - not least because they have dif ficulties with, say, Tibet and secessionist-minded Kashmir. Mr Bush, who has always had a soft spot for China, appeared to agree. At the end of his speech, he said the UN \"should not dictate the particu lar forms of government\" for member states, and that in his new world order, no nation \"must surrender one iota of sovereignty\". But by then, of course, as Mr Bush must have recognised, the genie of inter ventionism was already out of the bottle."

   "text_content" : "By Michael LItlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York HOPES rose last night for a negotiated settlement of the bitter dispute between Iraq and the United Nations over the detention of a UN inspection team at the national nuclear energy headquarters in Bagh- dad. After a private meeting of Security Council members, Mr Jean-Bernard Merimde of France, their president, said it appeared the inspectors could be freed after an inventory was given to Iraq of the material they had obtained. This relates to the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. How this procedure would be carried out was a subject of discussion yesterday between Mr Ahmed Hussein, the Iraqi foreign minister, and Mr Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of the special UN commission set up to inspect and destroy Iraq's most dangerous weapons. Mr Ekeus said an Iraqi writ- ten response to a strong pro- test by the Security Council over the detention of the inspectors contained some \"potentially helpful points\" that he was trying to develop. His talks with Mr Hussein also centred on the question of the UN being allowed to use its own helicopters - previously denied by the Iraqis - in the inspection programme. Mr Ekeus hoped that heli- copter missions would begin next Sunday and also that the detained inspectors might be out by the weekend. He insisted there would be no compromise with Iraq over the material they had assembled and reproduced after their unannounced visit to the nuclear energy facility. In agreeing to provide an inventory of the material - said to be personal records of scientists and others engaged in a weapons project - the UN would permit Iraqi officials to be present \"in the recording process\", but they could not be participants. Furthermore, Mr Ekeus said, the UN could not accept a situ- ation in which future inspec- tions placed its staff at risk of detention. This was why they were dealing with the crisis very carefully and trying to work out the appropriate modalities."

   "text_content" : "By Michel Prowse in Washinaton REVISED figures showing a larger-thanexpected decline in gross national product in the second quarter yesterday cast further doubt on White House claims that the economy ies steadily recovering from reces sion. The Commerce Department said GNP fell at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent between April and June. A previous estimate indicated a decline of only 0.1 per cent. The fall marks the third successive quarterly decline in US GNP since the beginning of the recession in July last year. GNP declined at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter and at 1.6 per cent in the final three months of last year. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed- eral Reserve chairman, is due to discuss the economic out- look with administration offi- cials today. The White House is expected to press hard for fur ther cuts in interest rates. The administration's public position is that a sluggish recovery began in May or June. On Wall Street, however, sentiment has become notice- ably more bearish in recent weeks, prompting sharp increases in bond prices in anticipation of interest rate curats. Separate figures yesterday showed a sharper than expec- ted increase in initial claimn for unemployment insurance - a sign of weakness in labour markets. Reports earlier this week showed a further fall in consumer confidence in Sep tember and a decline in dura ble goods orders. The revised GNP figures show consumer spending and business investment growing at annual rates of 2.5 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively in the second quarter. The overall fall in GNP reflects the third successive quarter of substantial inven- tory liquidation by companies and a negative contribution from trade. The figures confirm that inflation is moderating. The GNP price index rose 3.1 per cent compared with 5.2 per cent in the first quarter. The improving inflation outlook is seen as strengthening White House arguments for a more stimulating monetary policy.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber, US Editor, in New York THE El Salvador government and five guerrilla commanders have reached a broad agree- ment on the country's eco- nomic and political future, including steps to \"purify\" the armed forces and to reintegrate the rebels into civilian life. The agreement lays the groundwork for a permanent ceasefire, and both sides yes- terday said it could mark the first concrete step towards end- ing the 11-year-old civil war which has ravaged El Salva- dor. Talks are to resume on October 12. Mr Javier Pdrez de Cudllar, the UN Secretary General who called the opposing parties together 10 days ago for talks in New York in an effort to close 18 months of United Nations-sponsored negotia- tions, said: \"The Gordian knot has been untied.\" The US, which has given more than $4bn (Â£2.2bn) to El Salvador over the past 10 years despite criticism about army \"death squads\" and human rights abuse, welcomed the New York accords. Mr Bernard Aronson, assis tant secretary of state for Cen- tral and Latin America, said: \"If the guerrillas mean what they say in these documents, then the war is over.\" The breakthrough stems partly from both sides agreeing to accept on trust assurances about the future integration of the Marxist rebels in civil sodc ety - without a ceasefire first being in place. Under the agreement, a new national peace commission - made up of two government representatives, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas, the church and other political par- ties - will supervise enforcing the political agreement. Its recommendations are binding on all parties, and it will rule by majority. The El Salvador government has agreed to a guerrilla request to protect the right of guerrilla families and sympath- isers to hold on to land they have occupied during the war. In principle, it was also agreed to reduce the size of the politi- cally powerful Salvadorean military, although the rebels appear to have dropped demands to incorporate some of their officers into the regu- lar army ranks.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Budget Compromise Begins to Strain at the Seams",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0927_0006_004",
   "text_content" : "Recession and Soviet upheaval have wrought havoc on efforts to cut the deficit, writes George Graham THE BUDGOT compromise laboriously forged last year between the US adminhstration and Congress is already show- ing signs of strain, as interna- tional upheaval and domestic recession wreak havoc on the conditions on which it was based. The agreement aimed to cut the US budget deficit dramatic- ally over the 1991-95 period. President George Bush agreed to raise taxes and his Demo- crat opponents in return accepted tough spending curbs. But the turmoil in the Soviet Union has prompted calls for the rewriting of the budget rules to take account of the growing need for food and eco- nomic aid and of the dwindling Soviet military threat. At the same time, Democrats - and some Republicans - are eager to boost domestic spend- ing to help deal with the slow- down that hit the American economy this spring and from which it is only hesitantly emerging. Last year's compromise adopted a new approach to the problem of the US's ever-grow- ing deficit. Instead of the defi- cit targets contained in the old Gramm-Rudman law, the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act divided the budget into two. For discretionary spending, which must be approved each year in an appropriations bill, dollar ceilings are fixed for three broad categories: defence at 2011bn in fiscal 19, intner- national (mostly foreian aid) at l21bn and domestic at $198bn. SMandatory spending, such as social security payments, fed eral employees' pensions or Medicare health benefits, isu ot us muDQOr (Sbn) 1m2 104 111 Total spending 1,504 1,534 1,606 Discretionary 549 539 563 Mandatory 632 717 820 Deposit Insurance 115 32 -44 Net Interest 206 246 266 Revenue 1,141 1,299 1,449 Deficit 362 234 156 Souwe conwrulomna Budl ot ffi suoject to me same nxea caps, but legislators must observe a \"pay-as-you-go\" rule for such mandatory expenses and for revenues: any spending increase must be offset by a tax increase, and any tax cut must be offset by a spending cut. These rules have severely dampened congressional enthusiasm for proposing spending. Nevertheless, legislators have made a variety of efforts to circumvent or stretch the Budget Enforcement Act's pro- visions. Some congressional committees have, for example, made creative use of the clause which allow. the budget agree meat to be breached for emer gencies: money for i for st fires has been ds ate a emergency funding, even though these fires occur every year. Thes emergency clause is alsc being used by the Democrats in their current attempt to extend unemployment benefits. This would get round the obli- gation to offset this $6bn of additional mandatory spending by increased taxes. Congressman Les Aspin, the chairman of the House armed services committee, has made another suggestion: $lbn of emergency aid for the Soviet Union, which would normally come out of the $21bn interna- tional budget, should be trans- ferred from the defence budget. Administration budget offi- cials appear ready to accept this kind of limited deviation from the letter of their hard- won budget agreement, although they are wary of setting a dangerous preced ent. They are worried, however, that the accumulation of other strains could crack the com- promise. For example, Senator Phil Gramm, the Republican from Texas, has sought to counter the Democrats' unem- ployment benefits bill with an \"Emergency Economic Growth Act\" Including a cut in the top rate of capital gains tax to 19.6 per cent. Senator Gramm argues that this tax cut would over five years produce $9.5bn of addi- tional revenue because of the additional growth it would encourage, but it would be hard for the administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to score the measure in the shorter term as anything but a loss of revenue, which would force offsetting cuts in mandatory benefit pro- grammes under the pay-as- you-go rule. Further out, the administra- tion's efforts to sign a North American free trade treaty with Canada and Mexico could create difficulties. Ending tar- ifs on Mexican imports would create a revenue loss, which the administration would be obliged to offset by cutting mandatory spending on bene- fits. This would further increase the difficulty of get- capital gains tax cut ting the free trade pact past a Congress already concerned about the possibility of losing jobs to lower paid Mexico. The greatest strain on the budget agreement, however, is expected to come over defence. Traditionally viewed as the biggest piggy bank in town, the Pentagon's budget was already cut substantially last year, and US troop levels are now at their lowest level since the Korean War. Nevertheless, pressure is mounting from both Demo- crats and Republicans for much more radical cuts in spending on strategic weapons as the US faces what Mr Bush himself calls \"an opportunity for a vastly restructured national security posture.\" OMB director Richard Dar- man appears determined to hold the line on the budget agreement at least until after next year's presidential elec- tion. Against these pressures, however, the compromise stands little chance of running its full term until 1995. After the election, budget officials are ready to consider adjusting the caps on defence, international and domestic dis- cretionary spending, if in return they can win an exten- sion of the pay as you go prin- ciple. They regard this as criti- cal if the budget agreement is to reduce the federal deficit. Right now, it is not having this effect. The Congressional Budget Office predicts a deficit of $279bn this fiscal year com- pared with $220bn in fiscal 1990, and expects a record $362bn in 1992. It warns, how- ever, that the figures would have been much worse without the Budget Enforcement Act, and expects a steady reduction in 1998-96. But administration budget forecasters are confident that if they can only maintain the pay-as-you-go discipline, grow- ing tax revenues will eventu- ally bring the deficit under control, despite the likely surge in Medicare and Medic- aid health spending.",

However although Quebec supports steady progress towards a true Canadian com- mon market, it will not bar- gain away any economic pow- ers it already holds. Mr Bourassa favoured the proposed definition of Quebec as a \"distinct society\", transfer of certain federal powers to the provinces, the idea of an elected senate and a council of the federation to co-ordinate policy making. In Ottawa, Mr Joe Clark, federal constitutional affairs minister, said Quebec's response meant \"we have a good solid basis for negotia- ting changes.\" The Parti Quebecois opposi- tion in the National Assembly charged that Ottawa was try- ing to grab more economic power from Quebec. But the federal package's emphasis on economic issues may help Mr Bourassa in his coming fight with the separatists. * Ontario and British Colum- bia will post the most solid recoveries from Canada's recession, while Quebec and the prairie provinces are expected to show the weakest growth, the Conference Board of Canada said, Reuter reports.",

   "text_content" : "By Leslie Crawford in Santiago LATIN America's regional output is set to grow by 2.4 per cent in 1991, the first time in four years that the region's economies will grow faster than its population, according to the United Nation's Eco- nomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) based in Santiago. ECLAC's annual assessment of the region's economic health is the most upbeat of recent years. It notes that most coun- tries are enjoying economic growth, leaving behind the scourges of inflation and stag- nation that marked the \"lost decade\" of the 1980s. Countries that are perform- ing better than last year include Venezuela, which will surpass the 6 per cent growth rate registered last year; Argentina, which is emerging from three years of recession; Chile, now in its eighth year of solid growth; and Nicaragua, which is expected to show some progress after eight years of setbacks. Not all countries have found the road to recovery. Some, such as Brazil and Peru, remain burdened by a huge foreign debt and high inflation rates. Others are just begin- ning to embark on the tough structural adjustments needed to put their economies on a sounder footing. The region's slow convales- cence, however, conceals more radical changes. These include: * A dramatic improvement in the fight against inflation. After standing at 1,200 per cent in 1989 and 1990, the weighted average increase in consumer prices in the region has been reduced to less than 300 per cent a year and shows a clear downward trend. * Most countries are now functioning with more bal- anced public sectors as govern- ment finances have been bal- anced by the privatisation wave in the region. * Private capital is flowing back to the region for the first time since the debt crisis exploded in 1982. * The foreign debt issue has diminished in importance. International interest rates are falling, providing some relief on foreign debt payments.

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington A DUMPING case involving Smith Corona and Brother Industries (USA) took a new turn yesterday with a prelimi- nary ruling by the US Com- merce Department that Brother fails to qualify as an American manufacturer and, therefore, cannot charge its US competitor with dumping. Ten days ago the depart- ment seemed to imply that Brother actually was fully manufacturing in the US. It rejected a charge by Smith Corona that Brother was avoiding anti-daumping duties on portable electric typewrit- ers by assembling its products in the US with largely Japa- nese parts and components. The two decisions caused considerable confusion among US trade lawyers. \"Commerce has cast Brother into the neth- er-world of producers - nei- ther domestic nor foreign,\" said Mr Mike Coursey, a law- yer and former Commerce Department official. Since both decisions are pre- liminary, the department will now carefully study industry reactions in the forthcoming public comment period, Mr Coursey said. The two companies have been entangled in anti-dump- ing actions since 1979 when Smith Corona successfully charged Brother with dumping portable electric typewriters. In August the US Interna- tional Trade Commission ruled that Brother and other Japa- nese companies were injuring Smith Corona by dumping per- sonal word processors on the US market. Last April Brother sought to use the US anti-dumping laws to its own advantage. It charged Smith Corona with dumping imports of typewrit- ers assembled in Singapore. The jobs of its 400 Americans employees were in jeopardy, it argued. The Commerce Depart- ment's initial response was a finding that Brother produces a foreign-designed product at its Tennessee plant, \"using few and relatively non-critically domestically-sourced parts which add only moderately to the total value\" of its portable electrie typewriters .r-Â·---",

   "text_content" : "By Paul BeSt, Aerospace Correspondent AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, is expected to make a strong business case next month for the development of a new 120-130 seater airliner to expand the group's current family of commercial jets. A study on the development of a smaller 120-130 seater derivative of the A320 twin-engined airliner is nearly completed. It is expected to show that the smaller derivative, the A319, could be developed at a cost of $300m (Â£172m). This would be lower than the develop- ment costs of $400m for the A321 stretched derivative of the A20. Airbus believes the A819 would be a normal evolution and would enable it to compete better against its two US rivals, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. But plans to develop a smaller deriva- tive of the A320 have caused tensions among the four partners of the consor- tium. including AMrospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Can of Spain. Arospattale and Deutsche Aerospace are considering developing a new-European egonalJet with Alenia of Italy. However, their plans risk competing directly with the new A319 project. At the same time BAe, whose 146 regional jet would face competition from the proposed new French-German- Italian aircraft, is pressing hard for the partners to agree to cooperate on the new Airbus aircraft rather than com- pete against each other with rival regional Jet progamms. These divisions have been further highlighted by BAe's current opposition to an attempt by A a and AleI nia to take over de avand of Canada to strengthen their position in the com- muter aircraft market.

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva SWITZERLAND needs to be more energetic in dismantling domestic cartels and in apply- ing the free trade principles prevailing in its industry to other segments of its economy, according to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tar- iffs and Trade (Gatt). Domestic reforms to ensure a transparent and open market in all sectors could prove to be the crucial test of whether Switzerland can retain its com- petitive edge in a changing European and international environment, it warns in its first report on Swiss trade poli- cies. Swiss industry already appears to have lost ground in advanced product areas while many domestically oriented branches - telecommunica- tions, rail transport, electricity and construction - are less efficient than the export indus- tries, the report says. With one blatant exception, agriculture, Switzerland's for- mal trade policies emerge from the report as a model for Gatt's liberal principles. The federal constitution enshrines freedom of trade and governmental intervention in economic mat- ters is limited. Subsidies to GATT industry, equivalent to about 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product in Gatt's estimate, are small by international stan- dards. Tariffs on non-food imports are low. Unlike most other industrialised countries Swit- zerland does not restrict imports of textiles and cloth- ing. It has struck no voluntary export restraint arrangements - over Japanese cars or any- thing else - and it has never taken anti-dumping measures or imposed countervailing duties on imports. This attachment to liberal principles is not surprising in a country of only 6.7m inhabit- ants which is among the world's 15 biggest trading nations with merchandise exports and imports each in the order of 30 per cent of GDP. Gatt notes that Swiss per cap- ita income outstripped those of the US and Canada by more than a quarter in 1989, but at purchasing power parities it ranked behind the North Americans. This discrepancy is due in large part to the protec- tion accorded to Swiss agricul- ture through a broad range of subsidies and the imposition of tariffs, quantitative restric- tions and variable levies on imports. Four-fifths, some SFr5.5bn ($3.75bn), of the costs of this farm policy are borne by Swiss consumers. With the exception of agri- culture Switzerland's formal trade policies are given a clean slate by the Gatt secretariat. But it gives bad marks for the informal cartel-like arrange- ments between domestic pro- ducers and traders which it considers impede and distort trade even in industrial prod- ucts. It finds restrictive prac- tices in public procurement, mostly at the level of the can- tonal administrations, and it thinks technical regulations may also operate as barriers. Relatively high barriers to entry into the wholesale and retail trades - through build- ing and planning regulations, rules on shop opening hours, so-called \"public need\" require- ments - help to shield estab- lished traders from newcomers and facilitate the operations of cartels and other collusive practices across wide sectors of the economy, the report states. The Swiss cartel commission had explicitly tolerated several price cartels, for example in pharmaceuticals and books. National standards and regu- lations, in Gatt's view, impede access to the Swiss market for cars, special farm and con- struction vehicles, fertilisers, pesticides, sanitary ware, kitchen equipment and electri- cal machinery. The limitations on share- holdings practised by large Swiss companies may com- pound the adverse impact of tight product regulations and cartel arrangements on the country's economic resilience, the report warns. Switzerland told Gatt that a whole range of domestic bank- ing cartels had recently been dismantled and that new meth- ods were under study for meet- ing the social and environmen- tal goals embodied in its agricultural policy.",

   "article_dc_title" : "EC Seeks Progress on Farm Subsidy Cuts",
   "text_content" : "THE European Commission is looking at whether it can sug- gest changing the 1986-95 refer- ence period of its offer to cut farm subsidies within the Uru- guay Round trade negotiations, a key obstacle which derailed the talks last December. writes David Gardner in Brussels. This retroactive reference period, through which the Community wanted to get credit for cuts already made from 1986, was strongly con- tested by the US and Cairns Group of agri-exporters led by Australia. They rejected the EC offer, to cut domestic subsidies by 30 per cent over 10 years counting from 1986, saying it would in practice mean only a 15 per cent cut, whereas the US insisted on a 75 per cent reduc- tion over the coming 10 years. The Community has formally not budged from its offer to Gatt but officials acknowledge that the situation has changed. First, the sharp rise in EC farm subsidies since 1989 - of 30 per cent this year alone - has wiped out over half the EC's \"credit\". The Commission reckons it would have to cut by 23 per cent from now to 1995 to meet its 30 per cent offer. Second, the proposals by Brussels to reform the Common Agricul- tural Policy, through swinge- ing price cuts, for which most EC farmers would be compen- sated by direct payments decoupled from the amounts they produce, could change the arithmetic of any new Gatt offer.",

He expected final details to be worked out in further talks which would lift quotas on 16 apparel products. The liberalis- ation, part of President George Bush's \"trade enhancement initiative\" for the emerging democracies of eastern Europe, would leave import limits on only nine classifications of Pol- ish apparel. Textiles and food processing can be the \"engine of recovery\" for Poland, the minister said. Numerous French communi- ques have been received assur- ing the Polish government of support for liberalised access to the EC's food market. This in turn would bring in large quantities of foreign invest- ment capital. Mr Olechowski said the boost to the textile sector, which employs 600,000 work- ers, would be helpful in the negotiations to gain EC associ- ate membership status. He predicted that the Com- munity would reach agreement with Poland, Hungary and Cze- choslavakia this year. However, Mr Olechowski met some disappointment in his talks with US officials this week. He had argued that Poland should be completely \"gradu- ated\" from the textile quota programme because it no lon- ger subsidises its production and its own market is open.",

The \"conciliation\" was a formal step in the process by which the US can ask a Gatt disputes panel to adjudicate, and Washing- ton is now in a position to call for a panel. But Mr Timothy Relf of the US Trade Representative's office said the US was still willing to try to settle the matter bilaterally. There had been informal contacts with the EC aimed at trying to avoid an impasse. \"We would like the opportunity to digest what happened in the (subsidies] committee, discuss it back in Wash- ington,\" Mr Reif said. At the hearing Mr Reif maintained the US position that France, Germany, the UK and Spain had contributed $13.5bn (Â£7.7bn) in subsidies, a figure which would be doubled if unpaid interest were added. Such subsidies were inconsistent with Gatt's code, had adverse trade effects on world markets by suppressing prices, and had hampered the ability of US companies, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, to develop new aircraft. Salinas compromise on tuna ban President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico (right) has decided not to pursue a recent Gatt ruling condemning a US ban on Mexican tuna because catching methods involved excessive killing of dolphins, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mr Salinas has tried to defuse the row by promising to introduce regula- tions improving the protection of dolphins and said that he will seek \"a bilateral solution\" with the US. * Pemex has discovered a pos- sible Im barrels a day oil field in Campeche Sound, north of the port of Cuidad del Carmen.

Mr Tzannis Tzannetakis, deputy prime minister, said that next month four or five candidates will be chosen to submit firm offers for the $1.5bn (Â£860m) project.

   "text_content" : "Byv ULRymo USnoktl THE BBC is to make a revolutionary change in the management of its resources by creating a free internal market for all its television services. Between now and 1998, BBC pro- gramme makers will be progre- sively given the right to buy al ser- vices they need - everything from design and costumes to outside broadcasts and studios on the out- side market - if that is more effi- clent than the BBC's provision. In futute, the television service departments will have no set bud- gets other than what they can \"earn\" from BBC producers or Iu selling spare capacity to the com- mercial market BBC programme makers will in turn be given a strong incentive to seek the best deal because they will in future be charged rent and the cost of capital employed in making their programmes. At the moment, the BBC raises about Â£1.3bn from its colour licence fee of Â£77 a year. The annual run- ning cost of television was Â£943m last year. Details of the plan are expected to be spelled out next month. The creation of a competitive mar- ket for all BBC television services will affect more than 10,000 staff and there will almost certainly be signifi- cant job losses as a result. The move to a competitive market has already begun for film crews, where 30 per cent of work will go outside. The wider changes are being phased in over more than 18 months to enable' departments to prepare. The interval will be used to improve productivity and reduce numbers to try to ensure that BBC departments will be able to compete in the open market. The changes will mean that in future the true cost of making BBC programmes will be known. Senior BBC executives decided that the corporation could not go into the renegotiation of its Royal Charter, which runs out in 1996, unless it had made the greatest effort .to increase its efficiency. * Application of market principles will apply to regional as well as net- work television, but talks are con- tinuing on the extent to which that principle can be applied to radio. The fundamental changes in the use of resources are seen as a neces- sary precursor to a detailed exami- nation, now nearing completion, of what the BBC's role should be in future. Fifteen task forces have been meeting and are due to produce their reports by the end of the year. In television, there is no doubt that the BBC will fight to keep both its national television chaniels, BBC1 and BBC2, and produce a diverse range of programming aimed at the entire population. Some senior executives believe that although the BBC should remain in every genre of programme making, from comedy to documenta- ries, the output should be moved a notch \"upmarket\". In that scenario, the BBC would leave the most populist types of pro- gramming to ITV and satellite televi- sion. The debate about the future of BBC Radio, and whether Radio 1 should survive in its existing form, is more intense. There are also seri- ous question marks over the future of Radio 5, which carries a mixture of programming, including sport and education. It is seen as a disaster at a high level in the BBC because it is neither one thing nor the other.",

   "text_content" : "THE independent television production industry called yes- terday for the resignation of Sir Richard Attenborough, the Channel 4 chairman, and a restructuring of the board, Raymond Snoddy writes. The Council of the Indepen- dent Programme Producers Association, which represents more than 800 independent production companies, expressed a \"total lack of confi- dence in Sir Richard Atten- borough\". IPPA accused Sir Richard of showing contempt for Channel 4's commissioning editors and non-executive edi- tors. The issue came to a head over revelations in The Inde- pendent newspaper that Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief executive, had been given Â£500,000 in \"golden handcuffs\" to stay at the channel. Last week Mr Grade said he had asked Sir Richard for com- pensation for taking himself off the market and not taking part in the competitive tenders for new ITV franchises. Mr Michael Darlow, the IPPA chairman, said that Wednesday night's council meeting had been the angriest there had been in 10 years. Mr Darlow said yesterday that the special inducements were \"disastrously out of place\" in a channel designed to occupy a special place within public-service broadcasting. NHS consultants in receivership DEPARTMENT OF Health offi- cials were yesterday seeking ways of preserving the govern- ment's initiative to reduce hos- pital waiting lists after the col- lapse of Qa Business Services, the consultancy contracted to match patients on lists to available resources. Qa, the former management services division of the West Midlands regional health authority, was launched as a management buy-out in December 1989 and carried out other NHS consultancy work. The company, which employs nearly 200 staff, went into administrative receiver- ship yesterday. Nalgo yesterday called on Sir James Ackers, chair of the West Midlands Health Author- ity, to act to save Qa. In addition to the waiting-list contract, the company has car- ried out a range of other con- sultancy and computer ser- vices work in the National Health Service. It has included maintaining the patient admin- istration system for many health authorities. Recognition for new audit body THE Department of Trade and Industry has recognised the first new auditing body for 43 years, bringing to five the number of organisations allowed to supervise auditors. The Association of Author- ised Public Accountants (AAPA) has been recognised under the 1989 Companies Act as a body fit to train, supervise and discipline auditors. The other four bodies (the Institutes of Chartered Accoun- tants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and the Chartered Association of Certi- fied Accountants) have been recognised since compulsory audits were introduced in 1918. 700 benefit jobs SOME 500 permanent and 200 temporary social security jobs will be created in the north-west of England to administer two new benefits for the disabled, Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for social secu- rity and disabled people, said Spending fall CAPITAL spending by manu- facturers fell 6 per cent between the first quarter of this year and the secomd, the Central Statistical Olice said yesterday. The fall from a seasonally adjusted Â£2.7b to Â£2.5bn (measured in 165 prices) followed a 10 per cent decline between the finaal quarter of last year and e first three months of this year.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent 'THE THREAT of a political backlash awaits the govern- ment that first charges motor ists for using London's roads, according to a poll carried out for the National Economic Development Office. The poll shows that traffic congestion outranks house prices, crime and litter as the single biggest worry for Lon- doners, and most of them expect it to get worse. Few of the 489 Londoners polled suggested road pricing as the best solution. Most favoured improvements to pubn lic transport and roads, park- ing restrictions, or simply urging people to use cars less. Some 56 per cent of respon- dents said they would accept road pricing in central London provided the proceeds were ploughed into transport. Only 16 per cent would accept it in the inner suburbs and 6 per cent for outer London. Paradoxically, the poll sug- gests that road pricing would work well. The results show that a relatively modest charge of 50p an hour would make motorists cut the number of central London journeys by 25 per cent. The poll also shows that those journeys would be made by public transport instead, suggesting the need for mas- sive investment to raise its capacity before any road pric- ing scheme was introduced. * Road deaths decreased to a post-1948 low of 4,655 in the year to June, against 5,487 the previous year, the Department of Transport said yesterday. Safer vehicles, seatbelt legisla- tion and the campaign against drinking and driving helped to produce the decline. A Road User Charge? Lon- doners' Views.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Hughes, Law Courts Correspondent TWO CITY merchant bankers were yesterday alleged to have crossed the line into dishon- esty during a 1986 takeover battle to enhance their reputa- tions as \"persons who could make things happen in the City\". Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens are accused of commit- ting criminal offences during Guinness's Â£2.7bn takeover bat- tle with the Argyll supermar- ket group for Distillers, the Scottish drinks group. Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC, opening the prosecution for the Serious Fraud Office at South- wark Crown Court, said the two men had been prepared to cross the line that divided what could be legitimately done in a takeover battle from conduct that was dishonest. Miss Gloster said: \"They were prepared to act dishon- estly not merely to assist Guin- ness in winning the takeover battle but also in order to pro- mote and enhance their own individual reputations as per- sons who could make things happen in the City.\" Mr Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, Guinness's principal merchant banker during the bid, and Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing director at Henry Ansbacher, are jointly charged with con- spiring to contravene the 1956 Prevention of Fraud (Invest- ments) Act. They are accused of dishon- estly conspiring to induce Dis- tillers shareholders to exchange their holdings for Guinness shares. Mr Seelig alone faces another charge under the same act, and two faise-ccounting charges. Lord Spens also face one charge. Both have pleaded not guilty to an charges. Miss Gloter msaid that in late 1985 Distillers turned to Guin- ness for help when haced with an unwelcome takeover bid by Argyl. From January to Is19 Argyl and Guammss d fught a hard and bitter battle os limn of ooofuK share NOW the Gainnw share pr the more Ikly that D- tillers shareholers would acept its ar.

Some supporters had been Wodiised that they would be Idemnifled against any losses they made when they sold their Guinnese holdngs. None of the purchases or indmnities, which had created a false market In Guinness shares, had been disclosed to th City authimties. -n Gloster td: The pros- euti say that as a matter of law, ar tnghints s kind ae u n si th;ey are nt =The vice in the Guinness aSair is that thae encourage- ment to purchase or retain Guinane shares was backed by preises o secret indoeni- ties against loss so as to -deeime the markt into belev- in the wee genuine par- chases of large quantities of oGuimnes shars at high prices. The foundation of the Chr ngelat Mr seMuk and Lord Spu is that they took SIS this deepion kunowin t to e wreon - in other a*nd thowhr li aent a a it k Gaiter sal Mr sekm in l Oty, wgitl a irnemer reputation for winning take- over bids and as an inventive tactician. He had been a star at Morgan GrenfelL At the time of the Dist=ilers battle \"his personal ambition was such that he was ready to adopt a win-at4lcosts policy\". Lord Spens had previously been a director of Morgan Grenfell, where he had forued a close working friendship with Mr Seelig. He was not a iMend of Guinness as he had crossed swords with Ernest Saunders in an earlier Guin- ness takeover of the Bells whisky company, In which Anscher bad ated for Belt. However, Lord Speas had wanted to promote agood busi- es relationship between Ans- bacber and Morgan Grefell and acceded to Mr Seelig's request to pu1rase Guinness shares aganst an indemnity as purt of the support aperatioNL Miss Gloter oidd MSeeog and Laid Spens shared a com- man characteristic: a rediness to break the rules by which their professional lives were supposed to be governed, where it was to their ad- vantage to do so. Those had not been minor, technical acares or obscure City codi but serious trans gresslns of the law Involving wholesale dishonesty and the deception of large numbers of investors. Miss Gloster said that during the bid Mr Seelig had told Mr Olivier Roux, Guinness's direc- tor of finance, that he could find share supporters. He had declined to name them but made clear that Guinness must commit itself to indemnify them against loss. The question of support had arisen again in March 1986 when Mr Saunders, who had been obsessed with the perfor- mance of the Guinness share price, had put pressure on Mor- gan Grenfell to provide as much support as possible. Mr Seeug had told Mr Roux that one of the supporters was LS. Rothschild, a New York investment bank with a Lon- don subsidiary. Mr Seelig asked LFR to buy up to Â£25m of Guinness shares on instruc- tions from Morgan Grenfell, which would ensure that LFR was compensated for any loss. He had not said the compen- sation would be paid by Guin- ness and had, wrongly and dis- honestly, assured LFR that its purchases would not have to be disclosed. LFR agreed to buy up to Â£20m shares. Between April 4 and April 18, when the bid ended, Mr See- lior his secretary telephoned LFR In London on numerous occasions giving instructions for further purchases totalling about &9m Gualines shares. Unknown to Mr Seell Miss Gloster said, those telephone calb were taped by Mr Mark Sohn, bead of IF's London office. Mr Sohn had been instructed by Mr Seeog to buy nearly Sm Guinness shares before the bid closed. In fact Mr Sohn bought only about 1.9m, the remainder being bought afterwards, when the price had dropped. He had later told Mr Seelig the average purchase price had been 349.3p - the price of the pre-close purchases - when the actual average price had been 322.68p. After Guinness's victory, Mr Sohn had telephoned to con- gratulate Mr Seelig, who had asked him to give him, on a plain bit of paper, LFR's overall position, to enable him to assess the indemnity posi- tion. After playing a tape record- ing of that conversation to the jury Miss Gloster suggested that it bore \"the unmistakable hallmark of dishonesty\". Morgan Grenfell had subse- quently bought LFR's Guin- ness holding to keep it off the market while the price was depressed. Mr Seelig sent genu- ine invoices to Guinness, inflated to cover Morgan Gren- fell against an anticipated Elm loss on resale. Also, Miss Gloster said, Mr Seelig had been responsible for a false Â£1.95m invoice sent to Guinness by a Swiss company, Rudani Corporation, under an indemnity given to Mrs Violette Seulberger Simon, a wealthy woman living in Swit- zlandto persuade her not to sell shares bought on Mr See- llgs recommendation. She had bought Â£20m of Guinness, Distillers and Argyll shares. Mr Seelig had wanted to have Argyll shares available to \"dump\" on the market when it suited Guinness's tactics to do so, Miss Gloater alleged. The trial continues today.

The findings are in sharp contrast to a Gallup and Busi- ness Industries survey seven weeks ago, which showed con- fidence falling in all regions. The latest poll indicates that 39 per cent of the population believe the economic situation will improve over the next 12 months, 26 per cent think it will stay the same and 27 per cent believe it will get worse. Consumers also believe their household finances will improve over the next 12 months, helped by declining interest rates. The largest group - 45 per cent - thinks the situation will stay the same but 28 per cent believe they will be better off. Only 22 per cent take the opposite view. Gallup says there is histori- cally a fairly direct relation- ship between household sinan- cial prospects and voting for the government in power. Expectations of higher infla- tion were also at a four-year low, with only 19 per cent of the population expecting a rapid increase in prices over the next 12 months. The latest figures represent a marked turnround from Feb- ruary. In the middle of the Gulf crisis, 51 per cent expected the economic situa- tion to deteriorate and only 22 per cent thought it would improve.",

   "text_content" : "By John Hunt, Environment Correspondent UK COMPANIES were at- tacked by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, last night for inade- quate environmental manage- ment. Speaking in the City, Mr Heseltine warned shareholders, bankers and insurers that they must do more to ensure that companies improved their environmental performance. \"I wish I could say that we in Britain had more to be proud of when it comes to envi- ronmental management,\" he told an audience at the Swiss Bank Corporation. \"But the general picture within Britain is not impressive.\" It is the first time a minister in the present government has attacked business and industry for doing too little to reduce pollution and improve the environment. He said the position was even less encouraging in that leading industrialists told him the environment was at the top of their corporate agenda. \"There seems to be a large gap between perception and action,\" he added. Mr Heseltine said that companies that had not adopted high environmental standards would find it impos- sible to export to countries that had. Already, he said, one UK car company had lost an order because of that. A British Institute of Man- agement survey showed that more than half the companies questioned had no statement on environmental policy and 65 per cent had no one with specific responsibility for the environment. Less than a quarter carried out any kind of environmental audit. Public pressure on retailers and manufacturers to improve their environmental performance had not yet turned its attention to the City. \"I do not think this comfort- able obscurity will last much longer,\" Mr Heseltine said. No British bank, he said, had gone as far as the Deutsche Bank, which had a database giving information on funds for a company wishing to make environmental improvements.",

   "text_content" : "By John Hunt THE INDEPENDENT electricity-generating compa- nies yesterday called for an end to what they called \"the protective arrangements\" by which PowerGen and National Power buy their coal supplies from British Coal. They also attacked the \"potentially oppressive nature\" of the contracts under which the two big privatised power generators sell electricity to the 12 regional electricity com- panies. The criticism was made at the annual meeting of the Association of Independent Electricity Producers, which represents 100 companies which are in the power-gener- ating business or which gener- ate electricity for their own purposes and also sell it. The attack came from Mr Michael Spicer, chairman of the associ- ation, who when minister for coal and electricity piloted the electricity privatisation legisla- tion through parliament. The association says the three-year contracts between British Coal and PowerGen and National Power were agreed at the behest of the gov- ernment. That meant that the two companies had to buy the coal at higher prices than for- eign imports. To compensate for that, the association says, the two big generating companies charge the regional electricity compa- nies a higher price. \"I see it as an entirely unnec- essary for there to be protec- tive arrangements made for the big power producers in return for an agreement by them to buy from British Coal on special terms,\" Mr Spicer said. Once British Coal was nationalised, there should be no need for special deals, he added. British Coal, however, yes- terday denied any special arrangement with PowerGen and National Power. It said they were commercial con- tracts freely entered into and would be renegotiated on the same basis."

He said it was not possible to predict whether the Bank would urge the winding-up of BCCI when the case returned to the High Court on Decem- ber 2. Mr Leigh-Pemberton told a delegation campaigning for a reconstruction that it would be a \"very tall order\" to pro- cess a plan by December 2. Even so, officials pointed out, the Bank would take a view nearer the time on whether a reconstruction was likely. Mr Leigh-Pemberton also tempered his description of the \"criminal culture\" at the BCCI, saying his comments had been directed only at the bank's senior management. He told the delegation, led by Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, that his comments to MPs earlier this summer were not intended to smear all those who had worked for the bank. His partial retraction fol- lowed allegations that some former BCCI employers have had difficulty finding new employment because of the BCCI taint. Mr Vaz said Mr Leigh-Pemb- erton's comments at the 90- minute meeting added to the case for a further adjournment on December 2. He also urged the Bank of England to take positive steps to encourage a reconstruction. In July the Bank failed to obtain a winding-up of BCCI, when the High Court granted a four-month adjournment to BCCI's majority shareholders to allow them to explore ways of reviving it. Mr Leigh-Pemberton yester- day made clear that he would have the responsibility for the impartial consideration of any reconstruction plan and it would therefore be wrong for him to promote any particular course of action."

   "text_content" : "Philip Stephens talks to John Smith about his intentions should Labour win the next general election AMiley Aof wood Promises: John Smith rules out a devaluation of the pound I SlJohbn Smith. i In Mthe busiines of reas- surance, persuading the voters that a -Labour gov- ernment would not lose contsol of spending and taxes and con- vincing the City that it would not preside over another burst of 1970s-style inflation; Sitting in his office at West- minster this week, the shadow chancellor demonstrated quite how adept he has become at it On the eve of the last Labour conference before a general election there were two simple messages. Ordinary people would not have to pay more income tax under Labour - that-was a promise, a commitment, a pledge, anything you liked to call it. The City need not fear a devaluation of the pound - that was an equally unequivo- cal guarantee. The interview started with Mr Smith's ambitions: \"What I'm most interested in doing is getting the British economy up to the European level Every day I think about the fact that we have slipped behind.\" It was a recurrent theme. In the new-model, pro-European Labour party the response to charges that it represents a dark socialist past is a compar- ison with consensual economic management in France, Ger- many and Italy. \"It's interest- ing, isn't it, that Thatcherism never crossed the Channel.\" But doesn't every chancellor, Thatcherite, Majorite or Kinnoclite, want more growth, Yes, butAthere Is a long-term difficulty here. \"Since the war we have failed to make the breakthrough to a more pro- ductive and competitive econ- - omy. . .. WhatI want to see is the strengthening of what I call the real economy - the manufacturing base, the wealth-creating part of the economy.\" It is a long-term project. Some ambitions cover a five- year parliament, others a decade; but the route is never in doubt. Mr Smith wants investment, stacks of it - in plant, machinery, infrastruc- ture and, above all, in training. The \"training revolution\" sounds to outsiders like the 1990s equivalent of Mr Harold Wilson's White Heat of Tech- nology. Only this time skills, not computer chips, are the most important ingredient. Mr Smith puts it like this: if in 10 years a Labour govern- ment delivered that training revolution, creating the best- educated and best-trained workforce in Europe, then it would have \"achieved some- thing it could be proud of\". But what has Labour learnt about markets from the 1980s? Mr Smith appears neither an enthusiast nor a critic. \"The vast amount of the economy is going to be run by the private sector and it's going to run on market principles. And that's ine. But there are areas where markets fal and where they do the tairna4equately.\" Who will have the upper hand? \"Oh, it's a joint opera tion.\" Then the reference to Europe: \"This is not even rgued about in the rest of con- tinental. Europe . . . People there think it is so obvious that governments ought to have a role in economic man agement.\" - His plans will cost money, though. Investment incentive for industry, new training schemes - and then Labour has promised to put up pen sions, increase child benefit, improve the health service, renovate schools, rebuild the inner cities. It will not give a price tag, but the Tories say 1t would quickly add up to Â£3Sbn a year. All taxpayers would be lip in the pound worse off. Mr Smith dismisses such arithmetic. The only absolute commitments are to raise pen- sions and child benefit. Those will be paid for by abolishing the ceiling on National Insur- ance Contributions (NICs) - taking another 9p out of every pound of income from the 3r people who earn more than Â£20,280 a year - and by raising the top rate of tax from 40p to 50p. Everything else would have to wait for resources to be freed through the \"growth divi- dend\" - the revenue that accrues when tax rates are left unchanged in an expanding ar Kinnock once mentioned a jgure of Â£20bn as that divi- dend, but Mr Smith is an admirer of the broad-sweep approach adopted by Mrs Mar- garet Thatcher in her election manifestos. Principles are bet- ter than precise figures. \"The political argument for the 1990s is what is that money 'What I'm most interested in doing is getting the British economy up to the European level' Ithe dividend] going to be used for. You either say this will permit us to cut taxation, or you say the needs of the public sector are predominant and therefore we will spend it on public services, investment.\" The Tories were committed to cutting the basic rate by 5p. Labour would spend that money in the public sector. So would he promise there would be no income tax increases for the 20m people who earn less than Â£20,280? Under his plans for several new bands of income tax, run- ning from below 20 per cent to 50 per cent, surely some people now paying just 25p would find part of their income taxed at S0p or 85p? Now Mr Smith was clearer than ever before that the new system would not be a cover to put up everyone's income tax. He pledged that, whatever the rates and thresholds of the new bands, an individual whose earnings were below the NICs ceiling \"will not pay any extra income tax\". The question was put more precisely: So everyone earning below the NICs ceiling has a guarantee that, whatever the thresholds Labour introduces, their tax bill will not rise? \"That's right.\" Then, to rein- force the point: \"It is quite clear that people earning below the upper limit for NICs will not pay any increased income tax under a Labour govern- ment.\" It was time to calm the City. What the City worries about is that if Mr Smith found him- self facing a run on the pound, he might opt for devaluation rather than raise interest rates. How firm was his commitment to the present rate of DM2.95 in the exchange rate mechanism? Could he give a clear simple answer? He could. \"We regard it as an obliga tion that has been entered into which we will maintain. It is quite clear and it is quite spe cific. We are not going to change the rate.\" What if Labour decided to move to the narrow ERM bands, would he stick to DM2.95 in that context? \"Even in that context. We are not going to change the rate. You asked for a clear, simple answer and that's a very dear, simple answer.\" And then: \"I do not believe in devaluation.\" He returned to an earlier theme. The government should intervene on the supply side of the economy to encourage investment but it should not seek to manipulate demand through interest and exchange rates. \"The overriding purpose of macroeconomic policy is economic stability ... With stable interest rates and stable exchange rates, we are more likely to get investment to flourish.\" There was time for a word about his personal ambitions. Anyone who knows Mr Smith knows also that he would like to lead the Labour party one day. Now, though, he was dis- missive of opinion polls sug- gesting that if he took over now, Labour would have a bet- ter chance of winning the elec- tion. \"I am happy to be shadow chancellor. I hope to be chan- cellor under a Labour govern- ment headed by Neil Kinnock.\" Talk of a pre-election putsch was simply \"ludicrous\". Mr Kinnock will sleep soundly. As for the voters and the City, Mr Smith will have to wait and see.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor MR Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday identified low infla tion, more privatisation, lower taxes and better education and health services as the core of his party's agenda for the 1990s. He said in a lecture to the Institute of Directors that the collapse of socialism around the world had left the political field clear for those who believed in markets. Their advocates, however, needed to use that opportunity to set out \"coherently and per- suasively for a new generation the moral basis of the market economy\". Mr Patten, long identified with the left of the Conserva- tive Party but now a central figure in drafting Mr John Major's election manifesto, said the first imperative for the 1990s was a relentless battle against inflation. \"Tight control of inflation will remain the sheet anchor of our policy.\" That meant an unequivocal commitment to sterling's place in the exchange rate mechanism and its even- tual move to the narrow bands of the mechanism. In an unapologetic defence of the government's commitment to further cuts in income tax, Mr Patten said Conservatives would always allow the indi- vidual to keep as much of his or her money as possible. They also remained commit- ted to further privatisation, working from the principle that \"the case for collective provision in any area needs to be made out rather than the other way round\". He added, however, that the case had been made for public provision of high-quality health and education services.",

   "text_content" : "By Allson Smith BOTH the main parties engaged in a round of cam- paigning yesterday as they set out \"nightmare\" visions of Britain that would follow the election of their opponents. The Tories said Labour would cost up to 3m jobs and Labour said the Tories would undermine the economy and the welfare state. In a broad attack, Mr John Cunningham, Labour's cam- paigns co-ordinator, said a Tory victory would be followed by an increase in VAT to 22 per cent, the creation of a two- tier health service, intensified \"funding by favouritism\" in schools and unemployment ris- ing to more than 3m. Labour's forecast of a fourth-term Tory administration also included rising transport fares and record crime levels. Mr Cunningham said the damage done would be \"all but irreparable\". He was joined by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow health secre- tary, and Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, in rehearsing the party's warn- ings about \"creeping privatisa- tion\". For the Tories, Mr Michael Howard, the employment sec- retary, launched a dossier called \"Labour and Jobs - Hiding from Reality\". He said Labour's \"economically illiter- ate\" policies such as a mini- mum wage, commitment to the European Social Charter and a training levy would mean Britain beginning \"a night- mare journey of lost jobs and lost opportunities\". According to the document, the single biggest threat to jobs was the plan to introduce a minimum wage at half average male earnings, which the Department of Employment has estimated might cost between 100,000 and 1.5m jobs, depending on how it affected pay differentials. The highest independent estimate of jobs lost is 500,000. Mr Howard, whose claims were labelled \"absurd\" by Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, warned that Labour's industrial- relations policy would endan- ger the 300,000 jobs safe- guarded or created by inward investment since 1979. Labour's plans to abolish urban development corpora- tions might put at risk 150,000 jobs, he said. The government itself envisages that existing UDCs will end during the mid 1990s. The Tories were encouraged by a preview of the latest fore- cast from UBS Phillips and Drew, published yesterday. It said that if Labour won the election, \"base rates would probably have to rise to defend sterling's ERM parity. The uncertainties associated with an unstable hung parliament would probably have a similar effect.\"",

Before you put your name down for a Patek Philippe watch fig. 1, there are a few basic things you might like to know, without knowing exactly whom to ask. In addressing such issues as accuracy, reliability and value for money, we would like to demonstrate why the watch we will make for you will be quite unlike any other watch currently produced. \"Punctuality\", Louis XVIII was fond of saying, \"is the politeness of kings.\" We believe that in the matter of punctuality, we can rise to the occasion by making for you a mechani- cal timepiece that will punctually record an extra leap-year every four centuries, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar fig. 2. Nevertheless, such a watch does need the occasional adjustment. Every 3333 years and 122 days you should remember to set it forward one day to the true time of the celestial clock. We suspect, however, that you are simply content to observe the politeness of kings. Be assured, therefore, that when you order your watch, we will be explor- ing for you the physical-if not the metaphysical- limits of precision. Does everything have to depend on how much? Consider, if you will, the motives of the collector who on October 14, 1990 bid at auction Sfr1.1 million (about $880,000) for a Patek Philippe-the most ever paid for a wristwatch. He may have paid for its rarity, for its looks or for the complexity of its movement. But we believe that he bid for the 54-year-old watch simply because it works perfectly and he expects it to continue to do so for future generations. In case your ambitions to own a Patek Philippe are somewhat discouraged by the scale of the sacrifice involved, may we hasten to point out that the watch we will make for you today will certainly be a technical improvement on the Patek bought at auction? In keeping with our tradition of inventing new mechanical solutions for greater reliability and better time-keeping, we will bring to your watch innovations fig. 3 inconceivable to our watchmakers who created the supreme wristwatches of 50 years ago fig. 4. At the same time, we will of course do our utmost to avoid placing undue strain on your financial resources. Can it really be mine? May we turn your thoughts to the day you take delivery of your watch? Sealed within its case is your watchmaker's tribute to the mysterious process of time. He has decorated each wheel with a chamfer carved into its hub and polished into a shining circle. Delicate ribbing flows over the plates and bridges of gold and rare alloys. Millimetric surfaces are bevelled and burnished to exactitudes measured in microns. Rubies are transformed into jewels that triumph over friction. And after many months-or even years-of work, your watchmaker stamps a small badge into the mainbridge of your watch. The Geneva Seal-the highest possible attestation of finewatchmaking fig. 5. Looks that speak of inner grace fig. 6. When you order your watch, you will no doubt like its outward appearance to reflect the harmony and elegance of the movement within. You may therefore find it helpful to know that we are uniquely able to cater for any special decorative needs you might like to express. For example, our engravers will delight in conjuring a subtle play of light and shadow on the gold case-back of one of our rare pocket- watches fig. 7. If you bring us your favourite picture, our enamellers will reproduce it in a brilliant miniature of hair-breadth detail fig. 8. The perfect execution of a double hobnail pattern on the bezel of a wristwatch is the pride of our casemakers and the satisfaction of our designers, while our chainsmiths will weave for you a rich brocade in gold figs. 9 & 10. May we also recommend the artistry of our goldsmiths and the experience of our lapidaries in the selection and setting of the finest gemstones? figs. 11 &12. How to enjoy your watch before you own it. As you will appreciate, the very nature of our watches imposes a limit on the number we can make available. (The four Calibre 89 timepieces we are now making will take up to nine years to complete). We cannot therefore promise instant gratification, but while you look forward to the day on which you take delivery of your Patek Philippe fig. 13, you will have the pleasure of reflecting that time is a universal and everlasting commodity, freely available to be enjoyed by all. fig. 1: The classicface of Patek Philippe- cognized as the most advanced mechanical ing device to dite, Patek Philippe's Gyromax balance el demonstrates the equivalence ofsimplicity dprecision.

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff LLOYDS BANK is threatened with a series of one-day strikes from Monday over a pay restructuring plan. The strike will be the first national action across all grades of employees in the sector since 1983, accord- ing to the British Bankers' Association, the UK banks' trade association. Lloyds could not yesterday rule out the possibility of branches' being closed by the action, but said contingency plans would \"minimise the inconvenience to customers\". Members of the Bifu banking union said the action would involve more than 13,000 mem- bers of Lloyds' staff. A strike ballot was 63 per cent in favour of the action. The dispute is over new pay scales that Lloyds plans to introduce for its 37,000 employ- ees from next month. The bank's 3,000 managers moved to a performance-related pay system last year. The latest move involves employees from assistant manager down to clerical grades. EMPLOYMENT The union with a majority of members in Lloyds' branches will not, however, be involved in the strike action. The inde- pendent Lloyds Group Union, which has more than 20,000 clerical grade workers in branches, has advised its mem- bers to report for work as usual. It will hold its own bal- lot on the restructuring next month. The existing 26 grades within the bank are to be replaced by a seven-grade pay structure. Staff will be told their grades next month after the completion of a job evalua- tion exercise. The new pay scales would make Lloyds' employees the lowest paid in high street banks, said Mr Rob O'Neill, Bifu assistant secretary. \"Some staff will face a pay freeze for an indefinite period and most staff can expect a cut in their pay expectations for the future,\" he said. Lloyds said some staff would receive an increase in salaries after the regrading; others would be on lower grades, but would have their pay frozen. \"No one will get less pay,\" the bank emphasised. The last national strike action among bank employees in 1983 closed 2,500 high street branches in protest over the loss of a half-day Christmas holiday.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack PERFORMANCE-RELATED pay in the Inland Revenue has failed to motivate staff, a study commissioned by the Inland Revenue Staff Federa- tion (IRSF) showed yesterday. The findings came as the IRSF - which represents 54,000 staff up to inspector level - threatened industrial action if negotiations fall to improve the current pay offer, linked to a review of performance-related bonuses. Two academics at the Lon- don School of Economics con- cluded that only 12 per cent of Inland Revenue staff believed performance-related pay had raised motivation at work, while many were disenchanted with the distortions it caused. Dr Ray Richardson and Dr David Marsden found that 80 per cent of the 2,500 staff questioned had not improved the quality of their work, and 78 per cent said it made no difference to the quantity. \"This scheme has been intro- duced without thinking through how it can best be done,\" said Dr Richardson. \"It was Just bolted on, which seems a dangerous approach.\" The Inland Revenue said: \"We recognise there are defl- ciencies in the scheme. That is why it is under review.\" Does performance-related pay motivate? Research Unit, Inland Revenue Staff Federation. 231 Vauxhall Bridge Rd. London SW1V 1EH. Free.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomklns, Transport Correspondent SEALINK STENA LINE, the crisis-stricken ferry operator at present negotiating the axing of 1,569 jobs with trade unions, may have to yield its ferry operations on the Dover-Calais route to its rival, P&O Euro- pean Ferries, in the period before the opening of the Chan- nel tunnel. Mr Gareth Cooper, the man- aging director appointed to Sealink by Stena - its Swedish parent - in May, acknowl- edged yesterday that that was a possible outcome if the com- pany failed to raise productiv- ity to a level comparable with P&O's. The Dover-Calais route, the shortest sea crossing between Britain and France, is the busi- est and most profitable ser- vice for both P&O and Sealink. That might change when the Channel tunnel opens in 1993. The two companies want to respond by joining forces in a route-sharing agreement, if the Monopolies and Mergers Com- mission agrees. Industry observers, however, question whether a pooling of operations will work, with Sea- link's costs so far out of kilter with those of P&O. Mr Cooper acknowledged that Sealink's jumbo ferries were making only four return trips a day on the route, com- pared with P&O's five. Sea- link's employment costs absorbed 40 per cent of reve- nue, against between 22 per cent and 28 per cent for its rivals. Last week Mr Cooper announced the 1,569 job losses and the axing of the Folkestone-Boulogne ferry ser- vice in response to a plunge into losses for the current year. The move came less than a year after Sealink announced a twin-track programme of 849 iob losses and Â£178m-worth of capital investment in an effort to make the company recover. \"Sealink is commercially very strong,\" Mr Cooper said yesterday. \"We turn over Â£lm a day, we have a major market share on all of our routes, and we have a very good infra structure.\" Unions are resentful that the latest cuts follow so soon after the changes of last year. Numast, the officers union, said yesterday: \"It seems to us that the same dose of medicine being given out twice in less than a year is indicative of deep mismanagement.\" The issue will come to a head on Monday when new contracts of employment are issued requiring more work for pay that has been frozen until January 1993. * The port of Boulogne has asked the French government to back its efforts to find a new operator for Sealink Stena's Folkestone-Boulogne service. Boulogne Chamber of Com- merce and Industry has asked the government to \"intervene\" to encourage Soci6t6 Nouvelle d'Armement Transmanche (Snat), Sealink Stena's French partner, to take the route over.",

   "text_content" : "By Vanessa Houlder M /r Jim Cookson, the chairman of Euro- Spean Land, likes to think big and to develop \"on a scale where we cannot be ignored\". To that end he has drawn up plans for a series of business parks set in extensive country- side sites. The grandiose aim, he says, is to \"balance wealth creation with recreation\". He seems to relish the opportunity to remould the countryside. \"Who last did that?\" he asks. \"Capability Brown 200 years ago.\" Mr Cookson is proud of the social benefits he believes his schemes could bring. A pro- posal for a 2,000-acre site in the green belt near Newcastle air- port could reduce unemploy- ment in the area by up to 13 per cent, according to a report published this week. It was commissioned by European Land and carried out by W A Fairhurst, an engineering com- pany, and Nathaniel Lichfield, planners. European Land estimates that the \"Newcastle Great Park\", scheme, which includes housing, industry, a 36-hole golf course and a country park, could provide 15,000 jobs. An extension to the airport and two new by-passes would make these jobs widely accessible to the inner city, Mr Cookson claims. European Land's projections of the jobs that could, be cre- ated by its developments are treated sceptically by some observers. Many are unhappy at giving up green belt land and incredulous at the iiea that they should be gratefu for the country park when it was countryside at the outset. Mr Cookson rejects these argu- ments. The area is \"an environmen- tal desert\", he says. In his view it consists of sub-standard farming land, with no hedges, and angry farmers who chase away people walking their dogs. In its place, he envisages 1,000 unfenced acres well- stocked with trees. He scoffs at the idea of new business sites in the urban cen- tre, claiming incoming busi- nesses do not want to be on cleared sites in deprived areas. He believes the few remaining green areas in the city centre should be preserved. This argument is broadly supported by Newcastle City Council and European Land's proposals have been incorpo- rated into the city's draft struc- ture plan. European Land is no stranger to planning debates. Its first large-scale proposal was at Ashford, Kent, where it assembled options for a site at a time when prospects for the Channel tunnel were uncer- taUi. The scheme, which is now being pursued in partnership with Inry and the Chiurc Commissioners, was stalled by Mr Christopher Patten, the environment secretary, at the end of 1999. He ruled that it should be considered when the local plan is finalised in d cou- ple of years. Mr Cookson is scathing about what he calls \"luee- jerk\" opposition to develop- ment in the south of England. \"East Kent behaves as if it was part of the affluent south-east and it is not,\" he says. How- ever, he claims most people prefer the idea of the great park to the alternative of \"ruining\" small villages. An even more ambitious scheme - totalling Â£2bn and 10,000 acres - in Spain has presented far fewer planning problems for European Land, says Mr Cook- son. The company was invited to launch a scheme, he says, by the regional government, which had heard of the Ash- ford and Newcastle plans. \"With the opening up of east- ern Europe they felt they had to move and get their invest- ment in place,\" Mr Cookson says. He is seeking finance and expects work to start in 1992. Other schemes include \"great parks\" at Northumber- land, Ashford and Harrogate and a more modest scheme at Darlington (which has Just gained planning permission). Others are in the pipeline. For someone with such ambitious plans, Mr Cookson has had a surprisingly low public profile. He started- his career in the contracting industry. One of his first Jobs was supervising \"5idrunken Irishmen, 50 storeys up\" on the night shift during the building of Centrei Point, the London office block. After a spell at Wimpey he moved to Wakefield where he ran the north of England operations of the Scottish builder James Miller and Part- ner. He went on his own after working on the first phase of the North Shields shopping centre, which Miller built with CIN, the coal board's pension fund, in 1981. CIN dealt with Mr Cookson direct on the sec- ond phase. \"We took a chance on Jim for the second phase,\" says CIN's Mr Paul Mason. \"Jim understands the development process because he has spent a lot of time in the business. He is also blessed with the ability to look over the edge of the trench. He has basic experi- ence and flair.\" CIN and Cookson then worked on a complex Â£30m retail scheme in Wigan town centre. It was completed in May this year and is 90 per cent let. European Land acted as project manager and also receives a portion of the prof- its. After Wigan, European Land moved away from develop- ment. \"Development is wonder- fully exciting .and macho and doesn't make money,\" says Mr Cookson. \"You always worry, 'Will you get the last shop away?\"' The alternative to develop- ment he conceived is \"land wholesaling\". This involves assembling a land bank, gain- ing planning permission and feeding out land in parcels to developers, in such a way that the market is not flooded. The concept won the support of CIN. \"We thought we should look at something else than offices and retail,\" says Mr Mason. At the root of European Land's project is the pivotal impact of planning permission. \"If you look at development, the major uplift is on planning permission,\" says Mr Cookson. \"If you take a 10-year view of development, the uplift is enor- mous.\" And what of the risks? \"I am exceptionally confident that the schemes would go through,\" he says. \"But if only one in three went through, we wou'd still cover our costs.\" IPD Retail Office = Industrial ***** Ole N D J F M A M J 1991 1990",

The change in the IPD total return index in August was 0.2 per cent This marked a return to the positive rates recorded in May and June, following what IPD describes as some sizeable \"oneoff adjustments\" in the July results. Rental value growth remained constant at -0.3 per cent, while capital values showed an improvement over the previous month's poor results, with a decline of 0.5 per cent. The overall results contin- ued to be pulled down by the London market, where both rental values and capital val- ues in all sectors fell at a sig- nificantly greater rate than in any other region. Industrial property was the best performing sector in August. The year-on-year results recorded a positive return for the second month running. Retail returns also appear to be improving, by 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent in August. This was reflected in the year-on- year results, with the highest return achieved for a year, of -2.0 per cent. Offices continued to show the poorest results, with a drop of 0.4 per cent for the month and 10.3 per cent for the year to August. Yields moved outwards and the equivalent yield now stands at 9.6 per cent a year, the highest level recorded by IPD. All three sectors registered a further decline in rental val- ues.",

   "text_content" : "Technology is the path eroplane manufactur- ers are follpwing in their quest to stay competitive in theferocious battle for orders. In roducing the most sophistateaircraft the chal- lenge is to keep initial costs and running expenses as low as possible. Among the developments which Airbus, the European consortium, is pursuing for its A330-A340 family of medium- and long-range jets.is \"com- monality\" - sharing as many parts as possible between dit- ferent aircraft types. Both types of airliner will carry 335 passengers. But the A330, a twin-engined aircraft, will fly over ranges of up to 4,750 nautical miles - western Europe to the US Midwest, say - while the four-engined A340 will travel up to 7,550 nautical miles - say western Europe to Singapore. The A340, the clos- est of the pair to completion, is scheduled to make its first flight next month. The principle of commonal- ity is most strikingly visible in the fuselage. Airbus adopts the same fuselage cross-section for the A330 and the A340 as it has used successfully for its A300 and A310 twin-aisle airliners, which since the 1970s have been operated widely, initially in Europe and latterly through- out the world. Economies of scale are achieved by sharing as many structural parts as possible between different members of the Airbus family of aircraft. Costs can then be kept down. In the A330 and A340, this principle has been taken a stage further, to include the wing. Engineers were faced with the task of designing a wing that operates as effi- ciently as possible while carry- ing either two or four large, I urreUHi peralir sOMvice iuwUU IWO-= ZUwIU4 Uq- W IUIIM.

The wings were designed at Filton, near Bristol, by British Aerospace, and built at BAe's plant at Chester. BAe has built the wings for all Airbus's air- craft to date, starting with the A300, which entered service in 1974. The A330/A340 wing is the biggest to have gone into production in the UK. The designers have adopted two approaches to achieving the best possible lift-drag ratio - the lift performance as a proportion of the resulting aerodynamic drag. The extra lift from this type of wing con- verts directly into improved fuel consumption. They have designed a wing which is long and narrow, like that of a glider. It also has what engineers call a \"super- critical\" wing section - one where, at cruising speeds, part of the airflow over the top curve actually moves, for a few instants, supersonically - although the aircraft itself does not fly faster than sound. Both features contribute to improving the lift4rag ratio. In designing such a high-per- formance wing, BAe engipeers working for Airbus faced the task of how to adapt the wing to carry either two very heavy engines or four somewhat ligh- ter engines. This was overcome by the positioning of the outer engines Bob McKinlay, managing director of BAe's commercial aircraft division, has been involved with the A830/A340 wing since the design stage. \"The weight of the engines and the polton of the engines on the wing is ite In portant in arriving at tf c ,simi he explains. The wing is primarily based on the twinengine air- craft. The four-engine A340 was considered later. The A30 is powered, typi- cally, by two US Pratt & Whit- ney PW 4000 or General Elec- tric CF6 engines. The A340's four engines are, typically, the US-French GE-Snecma CFM56. Given that the basic wing is the one designed specifically for the A380 twin, the heavier weight of the four-engine A340 results in different stresses on the wing. On the A340, the bending moment is amply counteracted by the weight of the outer engines. Both aircraft have similar fuel capacity in the wing. The A340 wing, however, provides greater lift, which has been translated into greater range, so that, unlike its twin-engined sister, the A340 can cross the Pacific comfortably. Airbus is conscious of being a newcomer to the rough-and-tumble world of big- airliner manufacturing and marketing. With the A330- A340, it believes it has a win- ning design to last into the next century, and that technol- ogy will bring it its lead. It is confident of coming in on a wing but no prayer.",

   "text_content" : "ith trials of a comput- erised bar-coding facility for ware- house inventory control suc- cessfully completed, KLM, the Dutch airline, claims its rede- signed Â£7.5m air freight termi- nal at London's Heathrow air- port operates the most sophisticated cargo handling system in the world. The specially designed infor- mation technology system, the London Inventory Control Sys- tem (Lics), is helping to cut the warehouse's handling time for imports by nearly a third. Two years ago the KLM cargo handling facility at Heathrow was losing some Â£900,000 a year through ineffi- ciency. This year, according to Jack Hofstra, cargo manager for UK & Ireland, the facility is making a profit for the first time. The changes at Heathrow are the result of a decision by KLM to double throughput from 40,000 tonnes a year to 80,000 tonnes and increase the number of handling contracts with other airlines. In addition to the Lics sys- tem, developed by IBM, KLM has introduced a narrow aisle racking system and a comput- er-controlled pallet container handling system. The systems are linked with Cargoal, KLM's computer tracking system which has more than 450 termi- nals worldwide and can be con- sulted for up-to-the-minute data on any shipment. As well as monitoring move- ments, Cargoal also finds the optimum match between cargo volume and aircraft capacity and gives advance information on all incoming flights, so that warehouse space can be allo- cated well in advance of cargo arrival - an important factor when transporting perishable goods. When unpacking an incom- ing shipment, the warehouse- man confirms against the Car- goal data that the contents are correct. He also makes import/ export and hazard checks and keys his confirmation into his terminal. The Lics system, which tracks all import movements through the warehouse, locates the consignments when they are required and permits con- tinuous bond checks, enabling the warehouseman to produce bar-coded labels. It also feeds information directly to Customs & Excise and automatically updates the Cargoal data. The bar-coded labels contain airwaybill numbers and other information to allow accurate tracking of the consignments. Warehousemen read the coded labels with hand-held scanners, thereby automatically register- ing every single movement which the consignment under- goes. Instructions to the ware- housemen are relayed through computer terminals fitted to forklift trucks. The new IT systems have reduced import handling time by more than one and a half hours to less than four hours. Michael Terry",

The Prospeed 4868XIC use thin i transistor (TFT) active matrix technology, In which each of the pixels (plc- ture elnnemnts). which kes up the screen is controlled by three transistors - one for each of the three primary colours. The breaktdhrough for NEC has been in subtey controlling the mix of the three colours so that a total of 256 dlierent hues can be viewed on the 10%-inch screen at any one time. This control Is achieved through the use of specialised chips. Versions of the machine, based on the Intel 804868X processor chip, are available in Japan, Europe and the US. In the UK they will be priced below Â£7,000. * Sharp, which supplies many of the TFT screens used by other Japanese and US laptop computer makers as well as those sold under its own name, has developed a colour screen for notebook computers which significantly reduces the power consump- tion - one of the biggest drawbacks with battery-pow- ered machines. Due to the development of a novel ilquid-crystal mate- rial out of which to make the screens, Sharp is claiming a 70 per cent reduction In power consumption. A new backlighting system also contributes to a reduc- tion in the power used by the 8.4-inch colour screen. By using a special fluorescent tube and an efficient light guide, Sharp says the system consumes a quarter of the power of previous models.",

A^*v*t.T 'fJO , Ã½ <>;,,Tls *,**:.,.*^ ,. .;.^^> --- ****** * * O utside the Anglo-Saxon depart- ments of a few uni- versities there are not many people in Britain with a robust knowledge of the Icelandic language. Yet, inspired by his passion for fish and, in particular, his interest in obtaining the best sources of supply, this is a skill which Peter Vassallo has acquired. Vassallo is the 43-year-old. managing director of Vassallo Sea Foods in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the winner of this year's Venturer of the Year Award, sponsored annually by Cartier the Jewellers and the British Venture Capital Associ- ation. Now in its second year, the award aims to find the individ- ual who over a five-year period has made the best use of ven- ture capital in developing or expanding a business. Vassallo won the award for the transformation of what had been a family fishmongering business into one of the main suppliers of fish to Britain's supermarkets. He follows in the footsteps of Tim Hely- Hutchinson of Headline Pub- lishing, the successful book publishing company. Just four years ago, Vassallo received the injection of ven- ture capital funds needed to make the leap in scale he saw as necessary if he was to achieve his ambitions. Earlier this year, he sold the business for Â£13m to food and vegetables wholesaler Albert Fisher, one of many suitors which had sought to buy his and his company's expertise. Vassallo's success has been based not just on a very detailed knowledge of the fish business, acquired since boy- hood when he used to accom- pany his father to the fish mar- ket in North Shields on an old steam ferry. The judges decided he had shown considerable business vision - namely the ability to spot in advance, and anticipate to his company's advantage, the changes taking place in the sourcing, processing, market- ing and sale of fish. They concluded that his effi- cient use of the funds made available had helped to estab- lish a healthy business and provided his backers with a very good return on their investment. Vassallo, who had started his career as a teacher before taking over his father's busi- ness on his retirement, recog- nised in the early 1980s that traditional retail fish shops were coming under threat from higher cost of fish and from Peter vaMilo: transuformd family busrins into one of Brtflpws main mnu suppirse changing social patterns. With more women at work, it was clear that an increasing pro- portion of fish sales would be taken by supermarket chains, offering all the advantagep of one-stop shopping. Partly as a result of this trend, and also because of the loss of deep-sea fishing waters following the Cod Wars of the 1960s, an increasing proportion of fish sales were now of frozen fish. Yet with consumer stan- dards rising it was clear there could still be good opportuni- ties to increase sales of fresh fish, if it could be obtained and supplied economically to the public. His response was to set up one, and then a series, of bars selling fresh fish in local super- markets, but such a business, still based at that time on the fish he was himself personally purchasing at the quayside, had limited expansion opportu- nities. The way ahead was through a new packaging process, mod- ified atmosphere packaging (MAP), the use of which was then growing in the meat industry. This makes it possible to extend the shelf life of fresh foods by chilling and sealing them in packs with a special air mixture. In the case of fish, the process also had the advan- tage of presenting the prodd in an odour and drip-free on which cooking instru ons, weight and other information could be printed. Between 1984 and 1987, Vas- sallo was able to establish trad- ing relationships with a num- ber of supermarket chains to supply MAP fish, but he needed a larger operational base than the 2,000 sq ft sac- tory he was occupying to secure the credibility to win bigger nationwide accounts. was making only mar- ginal profits and expan- sion could not be financed wholly through normal bank facilities. His accountant, Geoff Nor- man, of Arthur Young in New- castle, introduced him to Tim Levett of Northern Venture Managers, who decided the risk was a good one. They made available a total of Â£300,000 through a group known as Northern Investors, in return for a 35 per cent stake in a newly-formed com- pany, and this was topped up to more than Elm by bank funding and DT1 grants. With the aid of these funds, Vassallo was able in 1967 to move into, and equip with packing lines, a 20,000 sq ft purpose-built cook-chill factory which had been established by the area health authority in the grounds of a Gosforth hos- pital. It had been intended to sup- ply local hospitals with central- ised catering services from the site but the plan had not worked, leaving the health authority with an expensive white elephant which they were glad to lease. Since the move, the busi- ness's growth has been rapid, taking it to a point where it now vies for market leadership in the supply of packed and chilled fresh fish with Young's Seafoods, claiming around 30 per cent of market share. Since 1987 employment has grown from 70 to more than 200 peo- ple and sales per employee from Â£77,000 to Â£135,000. Latest annual sales at Â£27m contrast with under Â£3m in the last year before the injection of funds, and, though profits before tax at Â£1.3m in the year to the end of July 1991 are rela- tively modest, they have been earned in a sector - fresh foods - where margins are very tight for suppliers. The company's client list now includes J Sainsbury, Tesco, Safeway, Waitrose, Asda and the Coop, as well as other smaller chains, and its prod- ucts are sold under both own label and brand names. Sources of supply have been diversified, too. Strong links have been forged with Iceland, Vassallo's main source of sup- ply, and, when required, the company flies in fresh fish from Iceland to Glasgow or Newcastle. Though costs are higher than for fish landed by sea, the willingness to meet demand in this way has helped cement relationships with customers. Quality is maintained by a rigorous system of inspection by Vassllo's own teams which now covers 47 suppliers' plants in Iceland, Greenland, Den- mark, Norway and the UK, and is reinforced by the company's commitment to high-quality standards in its own plant. Earlier this year Vassallo's Newcastle plant became the first in the sector to gain the UK quality standard, BS5750, awarded only where a com- pany's total quality manage- ment system is assessed as being fully adequate. As the company has grown, Vassallo has recognised the limits to his own ability to manage all aspects of the oper- ation, as in the earliest days, though when in the factory he can keep an eye on all depart- ments through a bank of moni- tors located in different depart- ments. It is perhaps all the more surprising, therefore, that he should have decided to allow ultimate control to pass out of his hands with the sale to Albert Fisher. \"I had never thought of being anything other than independent,\" he confesses, \"but I was very keen to see the company grow further. I wanted to take the company into Europe to replicate what we have achieved here, but if we had waited until we had had the resources, we would have missed the boat.\" According to Vassallo, Albert Fisher was a known quantity with a hands-off man- agement style, which will enable him to continue to run the business much as before. Moreover, although he will concentrate on building up Vassallo further during the next year, while he completes an earn-out, it is clear that there are wider management possibilities for him later within the Albert Fisher group, which has other fish interests.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack If one word has come to dominate the vocabulary of trendy management more than any other over the last decade, it would have to be \"quality\". The concept is now beginning to gain wide acceptance in the UK. The need is undeniable. According to statistics gath- ered from service sector com- panies in North America which have been collated in a recent report by the CMC Part- nership* a management con- sultancy specialising in qual- ity issues, 70 per cent of customers dissatisfied with the service they receive will go elsewhere, but only 5 per cent will tell you they are unhappy. Other figures are Just as worrying. Dissatisfied custom- ers tell an average of 10 people about their bad experiences, while satisfied customers tell only five. It typically costs five times more to attract a new customer than to keep an existing one. On the other hand, 95 per cent of dissatisfied customers will become loyal again if their complaints are handled quickly and well. However vague statistics like these may be, it is undeni- able that interest in quality has grown rapidly. The British Standards Institution (BSI), the independent body which issues the \"kitemark\" and is dedicated to improving stan- dards under its Royal Charter, introduced a Quality Manage- ment System standard, BS 5750, in 1979. About 12,000 companies have since been registered. It seems a far step from the BSI's first standard - for tram lines - at the start of the century. Patricia O'Rourke from the BSI stresses: \"Quality manage- ment is quite different from quality control.\" She says the latter is about screening prod- ucts or services to weed out any that are faulty. Quality management, by contrast, is designed to ensure that faults do not occur in the first place - or at least that they can quickly be traced and rectified once they are detected. Applicants have to compile a quality manual which contains every procedure involved in the production of a product or service. They are then audited, either by the BSI or by one of 18 other specialist consultants. The whole process generally takes between three and 18 months, depending on how near to the standards the com- Pa's, practices already were. Sinst organisations to qualify for BS 578780 tended to be from the manufacturing and heavy engineering sectors, a trend which reflects the ori- gin of the standard as a Minis- try of Defence specification for Its own contractors. Now applications are far more diverse. Most mauor car dealerships are working towards the standard. Over the past few years, service sec- tor companies have shown greater interest. There are solicitors and recruitment con- sultants among those already registered. Management con- sultants and hotels are among other industries seeking regis- tration. A set of guidelines for services will be published by the BSI next week.** he BSI has not compiled detailed statistics show- ing the value of the standard, but O'Rourke says: \"We are constantly getting reports that it is proving cost effective\". She says some com- panies use it as a marketing tool, while others have been forced to apply after pressure from their other business cus- tomers. At the same time, the Department of Trade and Industry has provided some incentive through its Enter- prise Initiative programme, which will typically reimburse 50 per cent of up to 15 days' worth of consultancy fees to help introduce quality man- agement. The CMC Partnership sur- veyed about 50 companies ear- lier this year to assess their attitudes towards quality man- agement. In line with BSI's experience, those which had not formally adopted quality standards felt that a standard would be bureaucratic and sti- fle entrepreneurial skill. Those which had, cited management philosophy, customer demand and competition as the main factors. Most companies which applied for BS 5750 registra- tion experienced difficulties meeting the requirements, and were surprised by the time taken to achieve certification. None had attained - or expec- ted to reach - the standards in less than two years. More than three-quarters hired a consultant to help them gain certification, believ- ing that it would speed imple- mentation, or because they did not have sufficient in-house expertise. Those that were implement- ig the standards without out- side assistance argued a con- sultant was too expensive, or would have no appreciation of their business. Half the companies imple menting quality systems aid the process involved minor tweaking of existing proce- dures, while the remainder had to conduct major struc tural change. Among the benefits from change were a reduction in errors and wastage, improved productivity, fewer recruit- ment problems, a smoother move into European markets and greater credibility with potential customers. However, the practices adopted by one defence elec- tronics company reflected the concern of managers that the concept of quality would 'b received sceptically by staff. A total quality manager was hired but he deliberately kept a low profile for four months, meeting only senior manage- ment and resisting any public- ity which might generate false expectations of any change. The message was gradually passed on through team train- ing sessions for managers, every one of which was attended by the general man- ager.. As an executive in another company remarked when asked to give advice to others on implementing qual- ity systems: \"Sort out your management first!\" *Attitudes within British busi- ness to quality management systems The CMC Partnership.

   "text_content" : "-N LIJZABTHn HALL In 1974, Slobhan Davies produced Pilot her first dae., a quietly penetrating viewr a gro atof travellers. Since then, her mc anr m has, at its best, eupad and ideas through a movement langage that kept a certain distance from its subJt without losing vital contact with it. (At wont her dances have looked analytically, remote, blanched of experience - but theae are a minority). In her company's autumnn pro gramme, on view at the QEH on Wednesday night, she showed us a new piece, Arctic Hear in tandem with last year's Dfferenrt Idas. On a first and single viewing, Arctic Heart seems to me to have too much of the Arctic init and not enough heart. Its inspiration is a text, Alasltair Muir Lauren Potter and Paul Douglas by the Awerian wre Gree 0 E\"u. O drmIng mustlhave bee.n remaabl yhrdy couplln. lt .Aain hnela UM flawi, for the ca an in two dirPitis by .or under- isc not Uhutntivebutcoat pL tive. Indeed, the dance mannerproposed by moat oi Davies' artists (the company comprises three women, three men) s self-absorbed, self-coniolous, so that they seem untouched oth bo the vaocallnugs and by the dance. Only in Paul Douila' poperfmanoce do urgencels of feeling, vigur of respone to the choreography, impel the movement - and the piece tsel - nto warm-hearted theatrical life. Otherwise the loop, curves and fail of the action, as the dancers lean on each other, look as if they had been kept in a freezser in order to maintain the correct Arctic climate of the emotions. There is a set by David BDuckland that con- trasts a backdrop featuring a dream-like female nude with a floorcloth in Icy colours, marked with Inult images. The resonances implicit in these two ideas, between frozen climate and human nature, do not sound loudly enough in performance. Such polarities are much clearer in the sec- ond work of the programme, Different Trains, which was created last year and admired in these pages by Alastair Macaulay. Steve Beich's score (whence the work takes its name) is a chugging, hard-driven string quartet layered with text and pre-recorded quartet writing. It confronts Reich's own childhood train trips across America in the early 1940s with those nightmare cattle-truck Journeys taken by Jew- ish children in Nadi Europe at the same time. The theme must ever be one of giddying horror, and Slobban Davies' choreography might seem too much under control, but the movement has an energy and a dynamic variety - rather like a sequence of brief film clips of incidents - that show her dancers as people rather than as cyphers. Paul Douglas was again a fine and vivid presence, and a newcomer, Deborah Saxon, possesses a fine linear quality - remi- niscent of Siobbhan Davies' own performances. Clement Crisp"

   "text_content" : "Film festivals impose contradiction on the critic. Although the sheer volume and impressive quality of the selections can create a kind of euphoria there is also some- thing to be said for the intense feelings of dread and alienation that result from seeing a pleth- ora of bad films. The recently-concluded Toronto Festival of Festivals offered the most impressive selection of films in an other- wise dreary year for Berlin, Cannes and Venice. Toronto follows directly on the heels of the Montreal World Film Festi- val, an event that is in serious decline. Montreal was received so negatively by the local press this year that the resignation of the festival's founder, Serge Losique, was called for. But Toronto had no problem satisfying the critical palates of a press corps hardened by the year's slim pickings. German director Volker Schl6ndorff (The Tim Drum) presented his new film, Voyager, to wildly appreciative audiences. Based on the Max Frisch novel Homo Saber, the film recounts the emotional odyssey of a civil engineer, Walter Saber (Sam Shepard), who falls in love with a young woman (Julie Delpy) during an ocean-going cruise back to Europe. This is Schl6ndorff's best work in ages, ably supported by She- pard's laconic yet elegant per- formance. Looking like an anguished Gary Cooper, She- pard conveys the tragic fore- boding that awaits the culmi- nation of a fitful series of coincidences. The best Canadian film of both festivals was Quebec director Lea Pool's The Savage Woman, which Montreal voted its favourite. Filmed in the Swiss alps, this is a melan- choly study of a reclusive engi- neer (Matthias Habich) who becomes involved with a woman (Patricia Tulasne) run- ning from the law. The tension of their doomed love affair is heightened by an ever-tighten- ing police investigation that begins to strangle their rela- tionship, and Pool choreo- graphs the deepening pathos with the hauntingly beautiful images that are her trademark. The Savage Woman was one of the few films that distin- guished the competitive sec- tion in Montreal, which also met heavy criticism over the absence of celebrities. With the exception of Marcello Mas- troianni, who flew in for a spe- cial tribute, not a single major European film star made an appearance. This was a source of considerable embarrassment to a festival that once played host to virtually all of Europe's film royalty. Particularly galling was the decision of the Montreal jury to award the top prize to Sal- monberries, directed by Ger- man filmmaker Percy Adlon (Bagdad Cafe), a dreary nordic drama set in Alaska and feat- uring Canadian country and western singer KD Lang as a sexually-confused mineworker who forms a relationship with a German librarian (Rosel Zech). It would be hard to imagine a stranger or less accomplished film winning an award at a major festival. One outstanding French film shared by Toronto and Mon- treal was Delicatessen, a sci-fi comedy set in a futuristic world where food shortages have inspired the local butcher to start carving up human entrdes. Dominique Pinon (last seen as the villain in Diva) and Marie-Laure Dougnac play two innocent tenants in a labyrin- thine apartment complex who struggle to survive the sur- rounding chaos. The film is a visual feast that relies on elab- orate sets, staccato editing and eccentric characters to convey the impression of a rotting society. Dougnac's enchanting and sweetly romantic perfor- mance added warmth to a film set amongst the ruins of civili- zation. Two other American films that deserve mention are Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King, and Walter Salles' High Art. The King Fisher is a major studio production that harnessed the talents of a skilled auteur in Gilliam, the former Python. Jeff Bridges and Robin Wil- liams star as a marvellous pair of tragic figures: Williams plays a former professor of medieval history who has since drifted into a mad street- dweller, while Bridges is a once-popular DJ whose world has suddenly collapsed around him. Their relationship is a superb testament to the simple virtues of friendship. High Art, on the other hand, is a crude deception based on the Ruben Fonseca novel. Feat- uring Peter Coyote and Amanda Pays in the principal roles, the film starts well by building on a mysterious series of murders in Rio de Janeiro that follow the path of a cele- brated American photographer (Coyote). But after he begins to investigate the death of a pros- titute he once befriended, High Art drops down to the level of mindless violence as our intrepid photographer is trans- formed into a revenge-seeking terminator.

   "text_content" : "Susan Moore reviews Artemisia Gentileschi in Florence rtemisia Gentileschi is A the most famous female .Old Master. The reason is as much due to her unfortunate fate as her considerable gifts which far exceeded those of Marietta Robusti, Lavinia Fontana, Sofonisba Anguissola or Ellsa- betta Sirani. At the age of 17 she was raped \"time and time again\" by her father's collabo- rator and family friend Agos- tino Tassi who .had been entrusted to instruct her in the art of perspective. The suit brought by her out- raged father Orazio and the subsequent sordid trial of 1612, in which Artemisia's honesty was tested by thumbscrew, ensured her notoriety and pub- lic humiliation. Her violent depictions of virago Judiths hacking off the head of Holo-i fernes, of Jael hammering the tent peg into the neck of the sleeping Sisera, have been seen as aggressive expressions of revenge and castration. It is a tempting interpreta- tion, not least given the self- referential aspect of 16th and 17th century painting. Michel- angelo had depicted himself as the flayed St Bartholomew in the Last Judgment, Caravaggio as the slaughtered Goliath. Titian seems to have given his likeness to the head of John the Baptist on the charger, and Cristofano Alori cast himself as Holofernes and his haughty mistress as Judith brandishing his head in triumph. Artemisia's gory portrayals of Judith and Holofernes are unconventional in that they depict not a fait accompli of severed head and bloodied sword but the arrested, blood- curdling moment of severing: the grim concentration of Judith's maidservant as she holds down the struggling Assyrian general; Judith, dis- tancing herself from the dis- tasteful act, gripping his head by the hair in her left hand and sawing through his neck with the sword in her right. In one version, Holofernes' blood runs down the bed in rivulets. In another, arterial blood spurts out uncontrollably in all directions, splattering the women with ruby droplets. Whi'e the depiction of the act of decapitation is unusual. it is not unique. It is no coincL- dence that Caravaggio had already depicted the same hor- rific moment, admittedly as less of a blood bath. Orazio Gentileschi had been his first followers in Rome. Unsurpris- ingly, a radical Caravaggesq\" realism informed not only h daughter's style and compoi- tion but also her subjectmat- ter. Her favoured and appar- ently feminist repertoire of Biblical and Classical heroines, of vengeful Judiths and Jaels, victimised Susannas and Lucretias, Salomes and Peni- tent Magdalens, Esthers and Lot's daughters, was in fact long established. Artemisia was successful ir her day, but perceived more as an exceptional woman than as an artist to be judged along with her peers. Her critical re evaluation began early this century but only gained momentum with the feminist studies of the 1970s. She is \"The Magnificent Exception\" in Germaine Greer's seminal The Obstacle Race, and played a major role in Ann Sutherland Harris and Linda Nochlin's exhibition of women artists 1550-1950. Two years ago saw the first monograph, Mary Gar rard's Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art and this year sees the first monographic show, at the Casa Buonarroti, Florence, until November 4. It is a strange exhibition, far from the full-bodied Artemisia retrospective one might expect. Given the restrictions of space at the Casa Buonarroti - the show is limited to three rooms and, presumably, restric- tions of cash - there is only one non-European loan - the organisers seem to have deter- mined on a show with a nar- row focus and a large number of purposely speculative attri- butions. At least five of the 27 pictures have probably have nothing at all to do with Arte- misia. She seems to be doomed to the fate of art historians attaching her name to any unconvincingly attributed and undistinguished canvas with suitably violent subjectmatter. Our great treat is a sight of the \"Susanna and the Elders\" 'Susanna and the Elders' by Artemisia Gentileschi r Â· I .? Â· I on loan from Pommersfelden. Excessive claims tend to be made for Artemisia's expres- sive originality. Here, she does seem to be retelling a time-old story from a woman's-eye-view and coming up with a power- fully different image. I doubt that a man could have exposed, as she has done, the vulnera- bility of a defenceless, naked woman taken by surprise and threatened with shame. Susanna is so often an excuse to paint a seductive nude in a delectable landscape, unaware of the peeping Toms who are plotting to seduce or defame her. Artemisia contains the action in a confined space where the double bulk and foul whispers of the conspiratorial Elders bear down on Susanna. Her awkward, zig-zag pose is acutely expressive of her fear and anxiety. If the inscribed date of 1610 is correct, the painting would be a precocious work for a 17- year-old. It has been suggested that Orazio may have helped in the planning and execution. A later date is proposed by those 'who see it as a work of her 'maturity, and by those reluc- tant to believe it Dredates her harrowing deflowering. During her later sojourns in Florence and Naples her work becomes still more classicising, less Caravaggesque. The last great work of the exhibition is a Neapolitan canvas of \"Esther before Ahasuerus, appealing to save the Persian Jews\". It is not an entirely successful pic- ture, despite the sumptuous- ness of the Venetian costume and colour harmonies. Artemisia is not well served by this small, provocative show. There are too few works by her, and too many bad pic- tures tentatively given to her.",

   "text_content" : "RIVERSIDE STUDIOS The Birmingham Rep, UK has joined forces with the Birmingham Rep, Ala- bama with the aim of swapping produc- tions. The British company took its pro- duction of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist (which had a London showing at the Lyric, Hammersmith) to Alabama earlier this year. Now the American company has reciprocated with Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill, a musical elegy based on the life of Billie Holiday. Lady Day naturally concentrates on jazz, and the story of Billie Holiday (Lady Day) herself. Emerson's Bar is the place in Philadelphia where she hfre- quently performed. Apart from a bass player in the background, there is only a pianist (Darrel G Ivey) who some- times speaks, and Lady Day, played by Chris Calloway. The show, written by Lanie Robertson, is a mixture of song and story in soliloquy. How well Ms Calloway takes to it. At the start, I thought she was excessively nervous, perhaps overawed by the hugely cavernous setting of the River- side Studios. This, I was told by an American lady on the board of the Ala- bama company, was deliberate - to show straightaway the effect of the drugs. Certainly that seems plausible, for Ms Calloway's performance moves with apparent effortlessness between relaxation and hyper-tension. It is those contrasts that help to make it such a pleasing show. At one moment Lady Day is telling stories about how segregationists were made to look fool- ish for their bigotry. \"That guy wore white socks because he had a colour prejudice.\" At the next she is express- ing real hurt at their attitudes. Then she is off in a world of her own, saying what she would really like - \"my own club where I could sing to all my fMiends\". Others with greater knowledge of the original may make finer judgments on the quality of Ms Calloway's voice. What seemed to me remarkable is the way she sticks to jazz without leaning over into pop. Only one number '\"T'ain't Nobody's Biz-Ness\" falls remotely into the latter category. I thought she was captivating and she ends with a beauti- ful dying fall, though not literally. Lady Day is directed by Martin L Platt, the Alabama company's artistic director, and runs at the Riverside until October 12 before moving to Birming- ham, England. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "BARBICAN IALL Very properly, Michael Tilson Thomas has seen to it that the LSOprogrammes this autumn contain some Leonard Bernstein mementos. Last night the orchestra began with \"The Imaginary Coney Island'Ballet\" from On the Town. Plenty of smooch and swing, and more bright, original touches than probably ever got noticed in the stage musical; and Tilson Thomas had his orchestra sounding spotlessly idiomatic. Not so, however, in the Second Sym- phony of Brahms - a curiously unap- pealing performance: well-honed and efficient, redundantly kitted out with quadruple, woodwinds, any hint of a natural lilt ruthlessly suppressed. Noth- ing really, bizarre happened, but it is not a work that takes well to arch, self-conscious phrasing (even for the cello-tune in the first movement). The nervy gear-changes in the Scherzo never colvinced, and the Finale seemed pure orchestral exercise, without buoy- ancy or elan. In betveen came the Finnish soprano Karita Mattila, to pour out a half-dozen Strauss, songs with superhuman ease. Few singers even attempt \"Frihlings- feier\", *vith its reckless leaps and its threateningly large orchestra; fewer still would tempt fate by singing it last. If it cost Miss Mattila the slightest effort, nobody could have told. As she soared up into the ledger-lines, her tone was as full and lustrous as anywhere else, and her low register penetrated the orchestral waves impressively too. No doubt the conductor's skill kept the tumult down a bit (though it didn't seem throttled), but one felt that the soprano would have been equal to any- thing. Beyond the lovely sound, the serene breath-control and her always musical line, there was not so much more to be remarked. The moods of most of the songs were registered sympathetically, once a very tame \"Zueignung\" was past; the actual words were projected without any sharp sense, so there were no particularly memorable phrases. Thus far she varies her tone-colour hardly at all - some cautious efforts in that direction, in Heine's quaint Christ- mas song \"Die heiligen drei K6nige\", were welcome and encouraging. At the moment, however, with a voice like this, such sophistications might seem like gilding the lily. David Murray",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-27",
   "text_content" : "WHEN a hard-fought board room battle results in the departure of the chairman, tne press headlines inevitably focus on management style rather than substance. But whatever the proximate cause of Sir Roland Smith's exit from British Aerospace it is clear that some kind of reckoning was due on more fundamental rounds. The business professor best kmown for his fistful of non-ex- ecutive directorships was the chief architect of a strategy of conglomerate diversification at BAe that had manifestly gone awry. Only the failure of an attempted merger with the construction and engineering group Trafalgar House denied Sir Roland the opportunity to deliver the coup de grdce to the hapless company of which he ceased to be chairman late on Wednesday. Sir Roland always looked a somewhat unlikely candidate to lead BAe out of the wilder- ness. His most successful boardroom venture was to pro- tect House of Fraser from the attentions of Mr Roland \"Tiny\" Rowland, the controversial chief executive of Lonrho, before selling the stores group to three Egyptian-born busi nessmen who subsequently turned out to be even more controversial. This expertise in trench warfare, however impressive, was scarcely the stuff of mainstream industrial management. Sir Roland's ear- lier track record in industry was chequered. For all that, the failure at BAe is little different from the failure that has dogged so many British companies in industries facing decline or structural upheaval. If the problems of the core business look intractable there is a strong temptation to diversify into areas in which manage ment has no obvious expertise. Chosen path That certainly was the story at BAe under the professor. His chosen path included the acquisition of a property com- pany just in time for the worst property market collapse since the mid-1970s. The acquisitior of Rover Group, which came just in time for a savage reces sion in the motor industry, was justified to institutional share- holders on financial rather than industrial rounds, an doubt because the industrial logic was slender. The pur- chase of Royal Ordnance, meantime, represented a retreat into the Idefence con- tracting area from which BAe was trying to escape. Again financial and property consid- erations played a key part. Diversification disaster This scarcely amounted to a coherent strategy. Nor have many others succeeded in pull- ing off the conglomerate trick. In the present cycle British & commonwealth has foundered after a disastrous diversifica- tion into financial services. Britain's biggest insurer, Pru- dential, is one of many to have lost millions in an ill-judged foray into estate agency. Even those companies that have diversified through acquisition in related areas have often found the going rough, witness glassmaker Pilkington's ven- iure into contact lenses. That is not to say the trick is Impossible. Reuters' diversifi cation from wire service to prc vider of screen-based dealing systems was an outstanding achievement. Even more sur prising was the remarkable success of the Trustee Savings Bank's initial diversification into insurance. Yet these ini tiatives were not primarily acquisition-led. Equally stri king, they were undertaken when the institutions con cerned were unquoted. Indeed, part of the wider cost of an active capital market may well be that quoted com- panies are under undue pres- sure to address fundamental structural problems with a quick acquisition fix, rather than a more carefully managed diversification through direct investment in new plant or skills. If the company is big, like BAe, the bigger and more risky the requisite fix. It is not a uniquely British problem. Bank-led corporate governance in Germany has just promoted a very question- able looking case of conglomer- ation at Daimler-Benz. But in Britain the capital market's system of penalties and rewards ensures that a more frenetic deal-making mentality persists among top managers than elsewhere. The need for a more sceptical managerial atti- tude to acqu'sitions is evident.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Anti-trust in Global Markets",
   "text_content" : "THIS WEEK'S agreement be- tween the US and the Euro- pean Community to co-ordi- nate enforcement of anti-trust policies is a striking demon- stration of the pressures on national regulators to catch up with the realities of global markets. As well as tackling a potential trouble spot in bilat- eral economic relations, the agreement may in time prove a rallying point for wider inter- national co-operation. But it is still only a first step down a road strewn with political and legal difficulties. Competition policy has long been recognised as the obverse side of trade policy: indeed, an attempt was made as long ago as the 1940s to create an inter- national framework for both in a single United Nations body. The linkage has grown still tighter as increased direct investment and mergers across frontiers have forced the pace of international economic inte- gration. However, efforts by national regulators to adapt unilaterally to these trends have often been either ineffec- tual or unduly disruptive. The transatlantic frictions created by US anti-trust inter vention several years ago in the Laker Airways case and the Minorco bid for Consoli- dated Gold Fields testify to the growing threat of jurisdictional conflicts. That risk has been increased by the EC's year-old merger control regulation, which explicitly authorises the Brussels Commission to vet deals involving companies headquartered - and doing most of their business - out side the Community. Efordcig remedies Attempts to extend regula tion extra-territorially can have legitimate motives. Merg rs between companies which are udged harmless in their home markets can arouse sa os competition issues in other countries. The problems art when authorities in the latter try to enfre remdies. They we only likely to succeed If they possess the brate force needed to impose their will beyond their frontiers - as the BC has been able to do on -Barl -IÂ·ghl s. By instituting a regular EC-US dialogue, this week's agreemmt sh rWede the danter of bifateal disptes-. However, it falls far short of the treaty originally sought by the EC, which would have drawn precise boundaries around each authority's juris- diction. That was rejected by Washington on the grounds that Congress would bridle at an international commitment limiting anti-trust powers enshrined in US legislation. Sovereign prerogative It is ironic that a govern- ment which has been strenu- ously seeking to foist its own model of anti-trust policy on other countries, notably Japan, should display such an unshak- eable attachment to sovereign Prerogative. However, the US position is a measure of the obstacles confronting any effort to lay down agreed inter- national ground rules for the conduct of anti-trust policy. The most promising avenue might appear to be through multilateral negotiation, such as the Organisation for Eco- nomic Cooperation and Devel- opment is currently trying to organise. But it faces an uphill struggle. Only half of OECD members have mergers poli- cies, enforced with varying rig- our and according to differing criteria. Attitudes to restrictive trade practices diverge still more widely. Even if more common ground could be achieved in these areas, a morass of procedural and tech- nical difficulties would remain. A still more fundamental problem, however, is that gov- ernments are themselves increasingly to blame for creat- ing the market distortions which anti-trust policy is sup- *osed to prevent. Under pri- sure from threatened domestic producers, both the US and the EC have in recent years Con- pelled Japn to accept elabo- rate trade restrictions, notabl n cars and semiconductors. In practice, these amount to em- yanctioned cartels to the rmation of which, In the BCs e, the competition mmire- ai r was relnctantly a party. western governments' Iurith for such anr meat sits oddly with their s-plaints about I rtelmaItfM of Japan's domestic mathet W hle nch Inuda nies pa st, peogrr towards cI asti a more rational amn ork far I**ntaUrneal olaeti pa- :Xy wTa l bam i gn at best.",

   "text_content" : "battle has overshadowe aI far more profound crisis denti at Ae. As Britain's blest defence contractor, the company s become a'caualty of the irieveible decline in the defence sector following the end of the cold war. Its commercial airctaft activities have been hit by tÃ½e seoere slump in the eviation industry Its Rover car and property operations ,are strug- gling in recession. \"The question of ProPessor (Sir Roland) Smith is not frantically rele- vant as far as we are concerned. For us the key points are the performance and the direction the company is going,\" one institutional fund. man. ager said just before Sir Roland's res- ignation as chairman on Wednesday. He was probably underestimating the importance of the resignation because it had clearly become a pre- requisite to help restore City and shareholder confidence in the group. But he was also pointing a finger at the fundamental challenge facing the management led by Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive, and Sir Graham Day, the new interim chairman. The problem is that not only are the institutional investors confused but so is the company itself. \"We seem to be lacking a sense of direc- tion,\" said an executive at one of the company's defence arms. Sir Graham emphasised shortly after his appointment that the com- pany now had to \"press on with alac- rity\" to deliver the strategy outlined in detail in the prospectus for its Â£432m rights issue. The overall plan involves accelerating the company's restructuring and focusing on the core businesses of defence, commer- cial aviation, cars and property. During the past two weeks, Mr Evans and Mr Dudley Eustace, BAe's finance director, have been touring the institutions to outline the com- pany's plans. \"The Dick and Dudley show\", as Sir Graham describes the investor confidence-boosting cam- paign, has not had an easy ride. The immediate task is to ensure the success of the rights issue to help fund the latest restructuring and pro- vide capital for long-term capital intensive projects including the Air- bus airliner programme and the devel- opment of the Rover car family. The next is to rebuild relations with insti- tutional investors. The third is to develop a more multi-national cul- ture, abandoning the company's past determination to try, in aerospace at least, to go it alone in developing new ventures or assuming the lead in col- laborative programmes. The company will also have to over- come criticisms that have arisen over the past few years, especially follow- ing its acquisitions of the state-owned Rover group and Royal Ordnance, about the nature of its inter-depen- dent relationship with government. The issue remains all the more ambig- uous because of BAe's needs to recon- cile long-term aims with the short-term concerns over stock mar- ket performance which have preoccu- pied management since privatisation. Finally, the new management will have to establish the necessary tech- nological, industrial and financial bases to ensure the necessary profit- ability to avoid the company's having to return to the market for more cash in a few years. Mr Evans says there are no \"black holes\" in the company. But cynics reply that the entire company may be a black hole. The diversification strat- egy designed to reduce BAe's depen- dence on defence has been costly, and so far has failed to deliver benefits. Mr Evans admits that one of the prob- lems this year has been all the cycles in BAe's main businesses going wrong at the same time. British Aerospace has resolved - for the time being- the top manageoient crisis whIch Itd engulfed the jcomany during the past few weeks. nil* *1a hnnpAAmpnm Trading profit (Em) 4- 2 019 19886 87 88 En ses and other 84 5,090 -roup (204) . .4,86 .

Ironically, the company's defence activities have increased their share of overall trad ing profits just when the group has been trying to reduce its dependence on military orders. Its defence divi sion showed trading profits of Â£273m in the first half of this year, the group's only source of positive results apart from property and construction. This was despite a fall in military sales, which - excluding Land Rovers and building work - was reduced to 39 per cent of the total compared with 43 per cent a year age. The high profits partly reflect the fact that aircraft programmes such as the Tornado and Harrier are now inr their late stages. The Gulf conflict brought a windfall, especially for Royal Ordnance, the ammunition and armaments subsidiary. But there was little or no change to the longer-term outlook of declining sales. The group has become heavily dependent on Britain's arms agree ment with Saudi Arabia, in which it acts as prime contractor. This has brought in more than Â£8bn in reve nues since the mid-1980s. The final size of the Saudi deal hangs on how long the Saudis choose to continue with it: on that, there is nothing spec- ified in the agreement. BAe's home market with the Minis try of Defence has become increas- ingly less comfortable, with the first enffects of post-cold-war cut, increased exposure to competition and strict enforcement of fixed pricing terms on new contracts. A gap is emerging between the end of Tornado production and the pro- duction start-up of the Â£25bn Euro- pean Fighter Aircraft. The new fighter to be built in collaboration with Germany, Italy and Spain was to have entered service in 1996. But the date has slipped and it remains unclear whether Germany will con- tinue to participate in the project. In any event, purchases by the four nations will fall well below the origi- nal target of 800 aircraft. All BAe's defence companies - mil- itary aircraft, the BAe Dynamics guid- ed-weapons business, and Royal Ord- 'The Dick and Dudley show', the investor confidence-boosting campaign, has not had an easy ride nance - have already been through heavy restructuring. More restructur- ing is likely at BAe Dynamics, in many ways the weakest of the branches and already pared down to less than half its size in three years. Mr Evans is now seeking a new part- ner for BAe Dynamics. Since its plan to pool guided weaponry with Thom- son CSF of France fell through six months ago, BAe Dynamics has seemed increasingly at risk of being left on the sidelines. Equally unsuccessful has been BAe's dalliance with the helicopter business where the only UK player is Westland. Top management has been divided on whether to enter the sector in emulation of other \"all-round\" aerospace companies like Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Aerospatiale of France. But its attempt with GEC to secure the contract to oversee the Royal Navy's new anti-submarine helicopter programme ended earlier this month in an embarrassing fail- ure, with the contract going to IBM. After being highly critical of the European Airbus airliner programme, in which it has a 20 per cent stake, BAe has increasingly counted on the European commercial aircraft venture for the future. Since it was set up 20 years ago, Airbus has captured 30 per cent of the world large airliner mar- ket. It has a five-year order backlog. Next week it will roll out its A340 four-engine aircraft, enabling the con- sortium to take on Boeing in the long-range airline market But the growth of Airbus will require more working capital from its four partners - BAe, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain - to support the substantial increase in aircraft production rate. Although Airbus made its first operat- ing surplus last year, its profitability is still low. Airbus is increasingly the core of BAe commercial aircraft activities. Its other operations in the regional and commuter airline sector are under intense pressure and their losses wiped out in the first half the profits BAe earned from Airbus, where it supplies the wings for all aircraft. Mr Evans has already made it clear that BAe could no longer continue to manufacture its own family of regional aircraft. The company is now trying to forge a broad alliance with other regional aircraft manufacturers. The market is too small to sustain several com ting regional jet pro- grarmmes.This com n, involving the companies o0llaborating in Air- bus, also risks undermining the con- sensus within Airbus. BAe's controversial takeover of Rover in 1988 also increased the group's burden of capital expenditure and spending on product develop- ment. While it has added to the group's asset base and turnover, it has done little to improve earnings. After trading profitably in 1989 and 1990 Rover has collapsed into loss this year in the face of the deep recession in the UKnew car market; it has run up a trading loss of Â£45m in the first half of 1991 compared with a Â£3Sm profit in the same period a year ago. This slide has underlined the dan- gerous over-dependence of Rover's car-making operations on the UK mar- ket. One of the group's strategic prior- ities has thus been to reduce this dependence by raising its exports - above all to continental Europe. It is trying to achieve such a transforma- tion in its customer base, however, when competition in the western European car market has never been so fierce, with the leading Japanese car makers also trying to expand their European dealer networks. In many ways the key to Rover's development lies in its relationship with Honda, Japan's third-largest car maker, which now holds a 20 per cent equity stake in the Rover vehicle operations. The relationship has allowed Rover to share the cost of some new product development and enabled it to adapt its engineering to Japanese levels. The link once offered Honda a cheap route into Europe, but as its own worldwide and European operations grow, there may be a ques- tion-mark over the rationale for its Rover connection. Much will depend on Rover's ability to bring the produc- tivity and quality levels of its UK operations closer to Japanese stan- dards. BAe is very keen to nurture the rela- tionship. \"One of the key elements in the revitalisation of the Rover Group has been the increasingly close collab- oration with Honda,\" admits the rights issue prospectus. When the Rover takeover was first mooted by BAe, there was much talk of the synergies to be gained from merging car and aircraft operations. Such motivations have long since melted away. Experiences elsewhere are mixed as General Motors and Daimler-Benz push on with their aero- space-automotive operations, but Ford and Chrysler divest the aerospace interests to concentrate on core operations. The fourth pillar of BAe's recent diversification strategy has been its expansion into property and construc- tion through its acquisitions of Arlington Securities and Ballast Nedam. The company saw opportuni- ties of hefty property development gains from the sale of closed indus- trial sites which would in turn help finance the group's restructuring. This has now backfired with the sharp drop in property values. In the long term, these values could recover; but in the meantime the company has had to turn to its shareholders for cash for the first time since privatisa- tion in the early 1980s. BAe has come a long way in the past 10 years. But it has yet to project a clear idea of where it is going. Its only comfort is perhaps that most other international aerospace compa- nies are in a similar dilemma. Six months ago, a senior executive of the French Aerospatiale group - BAe's historical partner and rival - asked rather peevishly why BAe's share price continued to defy the laws of gravity by trading at an unusually high level for an aerospace group. The past few weeks have brought BAe back to earth.",

   "text_content" : "From Ms Fran Bennett. Sir, Your leader (\"Chasing buttons\", September 25) makes a strong case for the 20 per cent minimum contribution to the poll tax for those on low incomes. There are, however, additional arguments for this course of action to those you rightly put forward. Yes, the principle has been conceded by the government, in its recommendation of 100 per cent rebates under the new council tax. Yes, it would make \"business sense\", in the words of the Conservative leader of the Association of County Councils, because of the dispro- portionate costs of collection. But abolition of the 20 per cent liability - without a claw- back of the compensation given in benefits - would also restore lost income to many beneSt claimants. On CPAG's calculations, the compensation did not fully make up for a reduction in benefit levels from 1988 compared with the gov- ernment's original plans. Many claimants, faced with higher than average poll tax bills, have found the compensation insufficient in the past. Lower poll tax bills this year are off- set by increased VAT pay- ments. There is now, therefore, an overwhelming case for introdu- cing 100 per cent poll tax rebates as soon as possible, without the \"politically unac- ceptable\" benefit clawback (in your leader's words).

   "text_content" : "Robert Peston, Paul Betts and Roland Rudd on events leading to the ousting of Sir Roland Smith A Sir Graham Day, BAe's new interim A chairman, revealed a mas- tery of under- statement just before mid- night on Wednesday. \"It was an interesting day,\" he said. \"It was diffcult.\" He was speaking at the end of a boardroom battle which had led to the ousting of Professor Sir Roland Smith from the chair of Britain's biggest exporting company. It had been a bloody fight, conducted as much in the press as in BAe's office block overlooking London's Charing Cross Station. By mid-after- noon, Sir Roland had agreed to resign, to be replaced tempo- rarily by Sir Graham, chair- man of BAe's automotive sub- sidiary, Rover. The press was alerted to expect an announcement at 6pm. But negotiations on the terms of the departure dragged on. At 11pm, red-eyed BAe directors emerged from their meeting. Sir Roland confirmed that he was going \"to end dam- aging speculation about the future of the company\". What he meant was that he hoped his departure would put an end to the rumours about splits in BAe's boardroom and put a floor under BAe's share price, which had been tum- bling for the past three weeks since the company's plan to raise Â£432m from a rights issue was made public in the FT. BAe's merchant bank, Klein- wort Benson, and its broker, Hoare Govett, were angry that the rights issue plans had leaked. They knew that BAe had become strapped for cash and needed the rights funds. But would they be able to per- suade fund managers to under- write the issue? Worse was to come. Sunday newspapers two weeks ago repeated the rights issue story and said that stockbrokers were forecasting that BAe would make healthy pre-tax profits of Â£300m this year. \"That was most unfortu- nate,\" commented one of BAe's City advisers. In the previous few weeks, the company had been working on its own profit forecasts. Far from being on course to make Â£300m, BAe's new budgets showed the figure was likely to be half that. Kleinwort and Hoare told BAe that it was obliged under Stock Exchange rules to make a profits warning on Monday morning - if it did not, there would be a false market in the shares. Another BAe adviser put it less charitably: \"They believed it would be impossible to complete the sub-underwrit- ing of the rights issue unless the market knew the true state Boardroom battle: from left, Sir Roland Smith, Sir Graham Day and Dick Evans of BAe's operations.\" After BAe made the profits warning, shareholders were furious. They felt they had been misled about the com- pany's prospects in the preced- ing months. But few used the reversal of BAe's fortunes to call for Sir Roland's departure. If BAe's profits were falling and if BAe had been slow to respond to downturns in its markets, that was the responsi- bility of its executives, notably Mr Dick Evans, the chief exec- utive, and Mr Dudley Eustace, the finance director. However, Mr Evans was regarded, both inside and out- side the company, as invalu- able. In the secretive world of defence sales, his relationship with Saudi purchasers was thought irreplaceable. If Sir Roland's resignation was not the result of share- holder pressure, why did he go? In fact, it was the culmina- tion of growing discontent felt by BAe's non-executive direc- tors, led by Sir James Blyth, the chief executive of Boots, and Mr Ronnie Hampel, a director of ICI, who was named yesterday as ICI's first ever chief operating officer. \"None of us are patsies,\" commented a non-executive yesterday, when asked if the non-execu- tives took the initiative. They had become concerned that Sir Roland's management style was no longer appropriate to BAe, as it tried to cope with the recession. Though his background is as an academic writer on management issues, Sir Roland's love is secret deal making. This was typified in 1988, when BAe bought Rover, the car manufacturer, from the government. The Rover deal was known in advance to only five people in BAe, Rover and the Department of Trade and Industry. Far more damage was done to his relationship with the board by a daring attempt to merge BAe with Trafalgar House, the construction and shipping group. Once again, BAe's senior managers were not informed in advance by their chairman of his plans. Last April, Sir Roland approached Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping conglomerate, with a proposal to merge with BAe. Sir Roland argued that there was an obvious synergy between the two businesses - particularly in property. BAe and Trafalgar House have a joint venture developing the Brooklands business park. Sir Nigel was sceptical about the merits of such a deal but had further conversations with Sir Roland over the following five weeks. In May, after Trafalgar reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Â£116.9m to Â£51.5m for the six months to March, Sir Roland was back on the tele- phone to Sir Nigel. What had caught Sir Roland's eye was Trafalgar House's property results - down from Â£64.9m to Â£19m. Sir Roland argued there was no sign of a revival in the property market. A merger with BAe, he argued, could shelter Trafalgar from a fur- ther property downturn. Sir Nigel made it clear that Sir Roland would have to come up with more details on how the merger would work before he was willing to put it to the board. When the proposals were eventually put to Trafal- gar's board, its members reacted with incredulity, according to a director who was prseunt at the meeting. Sir Rolapd winted to create a compmn which would incor- port the 'two conglomerates, though Trafalgar's ships and hotels would be sold. He would continue to chair the new group, with Sir Nigel as dep- uty. But there were no further details on who would run the divisions. What particularly irritated Trafalgar's board was that Sir Roland failed to define a role for Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive. Nor was there to be any pre- mium for Trafalgar's share- holders. As one board member put it: \"Sir Roland wanted us to agree to sell our company for the market price.\" It was then that other board members demanded whether Sir Roland had put the propos- als to his own board. The answer was no. For all their unhappiness with Sir Roland's style of cor- porate governance, a group of BAe's disgruntled directors believed it was more sensible for Sir Roland to go after a rights issue than before it. However, events overtook them. \"It became obvious two weeks ago that the board was against him,\" commented one of Sir Roland's friends. He turned for advice to Mr Brian Basham, the public relations adviser who had assisted his fight against Lonrho, the inter- national trading group, when he was chief executive of House of Fraser. BAe's board had to put a stop to the reports that appeared in last week's Sunday papers of an imminent attempt by BAe directors to oust Sir Roland - or the rights issue would flop, leaving the shares in the hands of underwriters. If that happened, the share price could remain under pressure for months if not years. The board faced two courses of action. It could reaffirm its support for Sir Roland or it could act quickly to replace him before the rights issue closed. By Tuesday its direc- tors had unanimously decided to ask for his resignation. They also unanimously backed Mr Evans and Mr Eustace to lead the company out of its current turbulence. Sir Graham was asked to take the chair because both Sir James Blyth and Hampel were actively engaged in their other iobs. But Sir Graham's tenure is temporary; there is specula- tion that Sir James could even- tually take over. As for the rights issue, the reason for Sir Roland's imme- diate sacrifice, there is no cer- tainty it will succeed. As a City adviser said yesterday: \"I have given up making predictions about this company.\"",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Barclay Braithwuite. Sir, In response to Richard Tomkins's report, \"Bid armada threatens ports\" (September 24), it should be noted that Aberdeen has operated extremely successfully as a trust port and it continues to do so. Its entrepreneurial approach over the years has resulted in an increase in cargo tonnage handled from 2.3m tonnes in 1980 to 4m tonnes in 1990. It is also worth remembering that trust status allows the harbour to reinvest all profit into upgrading and developing new facilities for the benefit of all its users, thus maintaining a high standard of service into the future. Aberdeen Harbour has care fully considered all the impli- cations of privatisation and can see no benefits for the port, which already operates to the stringent business prnci pies dictated by successful pri- vate industry. Unlike some ports with large unused areas, all of Aberdeen Harbour's land is fully utilised. Richard Tomkins's analysis of possible predatory consortiums confirms Aberdeen's disquiet that remote investment deci- sions are likely to disregard the local economy's reliance on the port. From the beginning, Aber- deen has said that the merits of privatisation must be judged according to the individual cir- cumstances of each port. This echoes the government's stated view which is demonstrated by the basically enabling nature of the Ports Act.

Sir, Amid the controversy caused by the proposals to increase the powers of the European Parliament (\"Accord unlikely on Dutch political union plan\", September 25), a major issue has been over- looked by the Dutch govern- ment. The nomadic life of the Euro- pean Parliament - committees in Brussels, staff in Luxem- bourg, pkmarles in Strasbourg - hinders its efsctLveness. A decision about a permanent home for the European Parlia- ment is long overdue. But it is not for the parliament itself to decide. The council has the responsibility. One result of the ineficiency inherent in having no fixed abode is the high level of absenteeism, espealy among Italian and French MEPs. (One would have thought the latter would find it very easy to get to Strasbourg.) In turn, this weakens the parliament's ability to infln- ence the shape of legislation because only rarely are more than 300 out of 518 MEPs pres- ent for votes under the Single European Act (260 are requaird).

So there is no doubt that there will soon be a big boom. The only question is: when will it happen? The future of video communication started with the first video link between Leipzig and Berlin. But that was back in 1936, more than 50 years ago. Has mankind made a lot of progress in the meantime? Yes, because we have developed the video phone, video communication systems for professional applications and conference studios, stationary and mobile, and of all sizes. Video messages can now be transmitted worldwide. National and international video communication networks are becoming denser and more efficient all the time. And step by step video communication is making increasing inroads particularly with large companies. But the big boom in video communication is still to come. Will video communication spread quickly and powerfully, just like a big bang? With ISDN? With direct-dial broadband networks? With CCITT standard H.261?

   "text_content" : "Joe Rogaly Here is a funny thought. Imagine that all you knew about the Labour party was what it put in Wed- nesday night's political tele- cast, while your entire stock of information about the Tories was derived from last week's Tory commercial. There would be no question about it. You would have to vote Labour. The Conservative effort was all filmic images conveying subliminal messages. To the untutored brain, one is pre- sumably that the prime minis- ter must have had a relationship with that woman or she would not have been photographed giving birth in honour of voting for him and he would not have been kept hidden from the cameras for most of the show. Beyond that it was totally mystifying. The Labour broadcast showed an actual person, Mr Neil Kinnock. He seemed very nice when made up. He spoke about political values. To the viewer who knew nothing else of domestic politics but these pieces of film, he must come out as the more intelligent and honest of the contenders. More information is, how- ever, forthcoming. Next week the television companies will provide full coverage of the Labour conference. The fol- lowing week it will be the Tories' turn. These affairs are conducted in rare dialects, without benefit of 'simulta- neous interpretation into English. I therefore offer a plain voters' guide to the tribal linguistics of British politics. First, Labourese: Mr Kinnock says that he believes in a fixed-term parlia- ment. Such a system \"takes elections out of the manipula- tive hands of ministers, any ministers, and puts the power of election fully where it should be, in the hands of the people\". Translation: If by some bloody miracle we get in I'll use every trick in the book to make sure they never get us out again. \"I believe people pay enough taxes.\" - We'll raise them as high as we dare. \"Our policy review and the changes which we have made in our party have shown - and are showing - that we are in touch with the values of the British people and that we will govern with common sense and common decency.\" - If we didn't score them with bogus allegations about nonexistent Tory plans to pri- vatise the National Health Ser- vice we wouldn't stand a chance. \"The great task which will face a new Labour govern- ment is the modernisation of Britain.\" - They fell for Harold Wil- son's 'white heat of the techno- logical revolution' in 1964. Perhaps they'll fall for it again. \"Our objectives are clear to build a world-class economy by creating the conditions in which business can succeed.\" - We've stolen Michael Heseltine's book about partner- ship with industry. In the telecasts, Mr Kinnock came out as the more honest of the contenders ...new pathways out of pov- erty and establishing decent pensions; building and improving public and private sector housing; combating crime; investing in a cleaner environment; and developing a health service that truly meets modem needs. - There'll have to be payoffs to pensioners if they vote for us and to the public sector unions if they keep quiet during the campaign. \"The old ideologies - com- mand economy at one extreme, crude free market economics at the other - do not work. If individuals are to flourish and society to thrive in freedom, people need the means to develop their poten- tial; economies need the vital- ity of competition that is both fair and efficient. That is the essence of modern democratic socialism.\" - And old-fashioned conser- vatism. This is a balanced column. When I contemplate the Labour and Conservative par- ties my chief dread is that one of them might win. So here is some Tory-speak, as devel- opun by M r John Major, from a script by the party chair- man, Mr Christopher Patten: \"I'll announce the date of the election when I am ready. Meanwhile, there is much work to do.\" - If by some bloody miracle we get in for a fourth time I'll as every trick in the book to make sure they never get us out again. \"We know from eastern Europe that there is an inti- mate connection between political liberty and economic freedom. Regulated, socialised economies trample on human dignity, despoil the natural environment and depress eco- nomic performance.\" - Kinnock is a neo-commu- nist. \"If the increase in a govern- ment's spending outstrips the increase in the country's income, the result is a bigger tax burden, a heavier debt burden - or both.\" - As I know from my own nerformance as chancellor and prime minister. \"This must be the decade in which we raise the standard of all our public services, up to and beyond the best we see today. That is what the Citi- zen's Charter will aim to do.\" - As long as it doesn't cost anything. \"We have to contribute to a cleaner world by preventing the pollution of our own water and air. Environmental quality will be a watchword for the 1990s.\" - I'm going to capture the green vote. - I'm not going to say any- thing that might lose the motorist's vote. \"With the election, so many pundits say, some way off, I naturally cannot offer a taster of our manifesto. (Mr Patten, last night). - Here is a taster of our manifesto. \"Our task in the next decade is to build on what was achieved in the last. I do not mean 'consolidation', a word that has been taken to mean standing pat, or drag- ging one's feet. I want to see us moving forward, drawing on the lessons of the 1980s, developing what has been suc- cessful, responding sensibly to new challenges within a framework of policies already in place.\" (Mr Patten) - We got rid of her. What else is new?",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard NATIONAL Westminster, the second largest UK banking group, is expected to announce today that it is to give up its status as an independent sinan- cial adviser for the sale of life assurance and investment products. The move brings NatWest into line with the other large banks and building societies which only sell life assurance and pensions as tied agents of a particular company. NatWest is set to follow Mid- land and Barclays by announc- ing that it is setting up its own life assurance company, proba- bly in a joint venture with the Bristol-based Clerical Medical life assurance company. NatWest will put up most of the money for the company, with a token contribution from Strike at Lloyds may closeow bank branches ............Page 13 Clerical Medical. By taking the joint venture route, it is avoid- ing the heavy cost involved in buying an existing company large enough to handle the business generated by the bank's customer base. The total cost is expected to be substantially lower than the Â£285m spent by Abbey National, the retail bank and mortgage lender, which announced on Wednesday that it was buying Scottish Mutual to help set up an in-house life assurance company to sell insurance policies to its 7m customers. NatWest will continue to offer independent financial advice through a specialist insurance broker subsidiary to those of its customers who ask for it. Its research has shown that only 5 per cent of its customers are sufficiently financially sophisticated to want to choose from the life assurance market as a whole. The withdrawal is likely to prove a death-blow for the independent financial advice market, with the overwhelm- ing majority of life assurance in the UK being sold tied agents rather than independent brokers offering best advice from the insurance market as a whole. Bradford & Bingley, the eighth largest building society, is now the biggest surviving supplier of independent sinan- cial advice. By becoming a tied agent, NatWest stands to increase substantially its income from insurance policies sold to its customers. Until now the bank has always claimed that its exper- tise as an independent broker enabled it to generate fee income which was comparable with the insurance commis- sions earned by its tied-agent competitors. By entering the insurance market late in the day, Nat- West may be able to start up its company considerably more cheaply than those among its competitors which decided to abandon indepen- dent status two or three years ago.",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels A DUTCH plan to bind European Community states into a political union ran into widespread opposition from member states yesterday. The criticism of the Nether- lands, which holds the EC pres- idency, appears to have come from as many as seven coun- tries, including Britain. They are upset that a radically- changed draft treaty on politi- cal union should have been tabled so near the December deadline for agreement. The clashes took place among special representatives of the Twelve at a session of the EC's inter-governmental conference prior to a meeting on Monday of the Community foreign ministers to discuss the Dutch proposals for the first time. The presidency was left in a quandary about how to pro- ceed, and Mr Pieter Nieman, the Dutch ambassador, said he would consult his government before the meeting of minis- ters, who will have to try to resolve the impasse. The Dutch draft proposals, outlined in The Hague on Tuesday, would give the Euro- pean Parliament more legisla- tive power and would bring much sensitive external and internal security policy making within the Community remit. Opponents to the plan fall into two camps - those, such as Britain, which are unhappy with the substance and those, such as Italy and Belgium, which feel the Dutch have introduced too many changes too late. Germany showed itself the Dutch plan's main backer, with Belgium and Spain showing some support. A UK official said last night: \"One can't expect the Dutch to withdraw their plan com- pletely, but we could go back to the situation at the Luxem- bourg summit (in June), when it was agreed that the Luxem- bourg draft should be the basis for negotiations, and then regard the Dutch plan as just one of several new sugges- tions'. However, the negotiations can go little further until the inter-governmental conference decides which is the main text it has to discuss. In a letter accompanying his new plan, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, had suggested that foreign ministers on Mon- day should start tackling all the main issues - foreign pol- icy, judicial cooperation, par- liamentary powers, social pol- icy and structural aid for poorer regions. M10.1 ~T1 IIS Alan Bond leaves a suburban Perth police station after lodging a complaint about the behaviour of a court official who served a bankruptcy notice on him.

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hargreaves in Geneva A SERIOUS RIFT broke open in the ranks of the Organisa- tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting this week in Geneva when Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, threatened to leave the cartel. The threat from Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, came after hours of being pressed by other members of the coalition to commit his country to cut its oil produc- tion by next year. Opec abandoned its historic system for sharing out produc- tion at the outset of the Gulf conflict last year when Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil was cut from the market. Saudi Arabia's ability to boost output from its quota of 5.4m barrels a day (b/d) to more than 8m b/d kept prices from soaring above $40 a bar- rel. However, now that Iraq and Kuwait are beginning to return to the market, many Decisions put off .........Page 32 Opec ministers want a commit- ment from Saudi Arabia that it will cut output again. Mr Nazer was emphatic that the kingdom would produce 8.5m b/d for the final three months of the year and was unwilling to discuss further than that. Mr Gholamreza Aqa- zadeh, Iran's oil minister, said: \"I am not satisfied at the way Saudi Arabia behaved at this conference. It did not co-oper- ate with the others.\" Mr Aqazadeh's comments threaten the fragile alliance between Saudi Arabia and Iran which has steered Opec policy since the Gulf war. Opec has pursued the kingdom's goal of achieving a stable oil price by keeping output flexible. Saudi Arabia says it will remain flexible when it comes to making cuts next year but, privately, officials stress it has no desire to cut much beyond am b/d. It wants output levels to be based much more closely on capacity rather than his- toric quotas. Few ministers seriously expect the kingdom to abandon the fractious producers' coali- tion, not least because of the sensitive role it has to play in Third World politics. Saudi Arabia is staking its claim to a higher production share when potentially stormy negotiations begin either in November or March. The crunch in the market is expec- ted in April when world oil demand will be showing a sea- sonal dip and when Iraq and Kuwait could be supplying close to their previous levels. The Iranian and Algerian ministers fear a price collapse in the second quarter of next year if Opec fails to agree on production quotas.",

The Britons, who were escorted by French paratroop- ers yesterday afternoon across the huge murky Zaire river to the neighbouring Congolese capital, Brazzaville, said three days of rioting, killing, looting and raping by mutinous sol- diers and impoverished city dwellers had completely wrecked the capital. One woman said the govern- ment had been warned last week that the army would go on the rampage unless they got a pay rise by Monday. She said many of the looters were drunk on stolen liquor and broke into stores and homes telling residents to stand aside and saying they had come to help themselves. A businessman said he had been looted twice, first at gun- SFrance and Belgium lose faith In Mobutu .........Page 4 point by soldiers and later by civilians with knives who had stripped his house and carried off money, a television, radio and furniture. Mosquitoes buzzed through the equatorial night as the ref- ugees, many of them exhausted and holding a few hastily-gathered possessions, lay on foam mattresses in an open school gymnasium which has become home to at least 200 western evacuees. Many of the refugees said they had abandoned their homes and fled by car to the river bank where they left their vehicles, some with the engines running. A group of Belgians, inter- viewed at Brazzaville airport last night, described a similar scene of violence and disorder in the southern mining town of Kowlezi. One Belgian woman said that soldiers had completely destroyed the town and had gone on a \"wild orgy of destruction\". She said that there were sev- eral hundred western mining workers desperate to leave the town and were waiting for French and Belgian military aircraft to carry them to safety. Reuter reports from Kins- hasa: The South African gov- ernment flew 130 foreigners including 53 Britons out of Zaire yesterday, the first air evacuation it has organised from the country, South Afri- can officials said. A chartered Safair Boeing 707 flew intoKinshasa airport, which is controlled by some of the 600 French troops sent to Zaire to protect foreigners after soldiers started an orgy of looting in several cities this week. One of the passengers on the flight to Johannesburg, Mr Mike Hermanson, a South African businessman, told reporters on arrival: \"Kins- hasa is destroyed. Nothing but name boards remain of busi- nesses. Cars were taken from showrooms, driven until they ran out of petrol, and then stripped to their chassis by the roadside. Everything is just gone. There is nothing. It is hard to conceive.\" Mr Herman Hanekom, a South African diplomat, said the devastation left by the rebellion was evident at Kins- hasa's Ndjil airport. Not only the airport bauildings had been vandalised but even the appa- ratus in the control tower had been destroyed.",

The group's defenders argue that it still stands to make large sums from the next phase of the Saudi contract; that someone has to make money some day out of civil aircraft construction; that the property assets must have value in the long run; and that Rover could swing massively into profit as the UK car market moves out of recession. For the long-term investor, the fundamental objection to that has to do with manage- ment. BAe correctly foresaw in the mid-1980s that defence con- tracting could not be money for old rope indefinitely. Too much of its response was to buy clapped-out industrial plant for its land value, thus substituting speculation for industrial strategy. Given the structural incoherence which has resulted, it is difficult to see why a long-term fund would want a stake in the group at all. Hillsdown Holdings In a supposedly stable busi- ness such as food manufactur- ing, any rights issue takes spe- cial pleading. Hillsdown's erratic record makes the job harder again. The ostensible purpose of yesterday's Â£280m rights issue is to strengthen the balance sheet as a prelude to small and medium-sized acquisitions. The problem is that the group's acquisition record, though excellent in the early 1980s, has been a lot more patchy since. It looks suspiciously as if shareholders are being asked to pay for the warehousing of unproductive assets such as furniture and property which are due for eventual disposal. The group can point to its recent interim figures as evi- dence that the strength of its cash flow is reducing debt as planned. But the true operat- ing cash flow is probably less than the bald figures suggest. The timing has upset a brief period of stability for Hills- down shares. Investors doubt- less remember the bear raids FT-SE Index: 2,55.6 (-2.2) HIllsdown Share price relative to the FT~A Food Manufacturing Index 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 198586 87 88 89 90 91 Source: Datastream in January and the poor perfor- mance of the shares since 1987. The admission that real earn- ings growth is now unlikely to resume until 1993 means there will have been a five-year hia- tus, long enough to suggest the company has lost its way. Yes- terday's 10 per cent fall in the share price was justified, but may not mark the end of the episode. Vickers At least Vickers is not launching a rights issue. There is otherwise little consolation for investors who watched its value drop by more than 10 per cent yesterday on news of a yet more awful first half from Rolls-Royce cars. The market is now clearly worried that the final dividend will be cut. But if the shares are unattractive to yield funds, the question is whether they are attractive to buyers interested in recovery potential. At one level the problems of Rolls-Royce are purely cyclical. It has maintained its share of the luxury market. In theory, aggressive cost-cutting should bring rapid earnings recovery once volume revives. But it is hard to see where demand is lurking. Japanese turnover has suddenly slumped in response to financial scandals. The US luxury tax and UK political uncertainty will dilute the ben- efits of economic upturn in those markets. It is thus moot whether Rolls-Royce will contribute much, if anything, to 1992 prof- its. Its vulnerability to the cycle makes an absurdity of Sir Ron Brierley's demerger sug- gestion last year. The question is rather whether it needs a parent with broader shoulders. The rest of Vickers is perform- ing quite well, but thanks to Rolls-Royce the group may be lucky to break even at the pre- tax level this year. At 169p, the shares are on a historic multi- ple of just over 6. Given that it may be 1993 before real recov- ery sets in, that does not neces- sarily make them cheap. Redland Redland has been no better than its peers at bucking the dreadful trend in UK building materials. The group's sinan- cial strength and its successful German roofing business, though, again made for a rather less gloomy first half story than those from the domestic competition. A 27 per cent drop in pre-tax profits was roughly what the market had been expecting, even if the 44 per cent drop in earnings per share - the effect of unre- lieved ACT - is a more star- tling figure. The case for buying the shares - up 5p to 553p after the results - rests to some extent on geographical spread. With the UK's brick and roof- tile markets likely to languish through most of 1992, any upturn in the US and Austra- lia, with further progress in Germany, should add a further 10-15 per cent to the Â£180m- Â£190m which now looks likely for this year. Fears that Ger- many will run out of steam are probably overdone in view of successes in the east. Believing in the US bounce, though, remains an act of faith. Redland's premium rating - best exemplified by a 6 per cent yield - is certainly justi- fied. Its heavy capital invest- ment of the past three years should ultimately reap hand- some rewards. The trouble is that the whole sector still seems overvalued. ICI The elevation of Mr Ronnie Hampel to chief operating offi- cer of Imperial Chemical Indus- tries represents a real shift in the UK tradition of corporate governance. For over half a century, ICI's chairman and chief executive has enjoyed the lonely eminence of a pope among cardinals. The wholly sensible decision to share the burden looks like yet another of the advantages conferred by Lord Hanson's selfless pres- ence on the share register. The appointment also puts in question the democratic ICI tradition of appointing the chairman by the formal vote of fellow directors. Mr Hampel is due to retire shortly before the present chairman. Assuming the new structure survives, his successor will surely be seen as heir apparent.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peiton Ronnie Hampel IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, is splitting the role of its chairman for the first time and is about to re-allocate responsibilities of its executive directors. Mr Ronnie Hampel, 59, is becoming chief operating officer. \"The tradition chairman's Job at ICI has become too big for any one person,\" said an ICI director. \"Markets are now global. Shareholders need constant attention. Huge amounts of time have to be spent with members ol the government and officials.\" Sir Denys Henderson, who retains his title of chairman and chief executive officer, will con- centrate on strategy and project- ing ICI's image. Mr Hampel will be responsible for day-to-day operations and will put into effect the company's reconstruction announced earner this year. ICI has made a charge of Â£300m after tax to cover expected costs of its reorganisation, which it says will add Â£400m to pre-tax profits by mid-1909. Mr Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace. There had been speculation that he would succeed Sir Roland Smith as chairman of BAe. Mr Hampel's appointment as chief operating officer is analo- gous to other companies' deci- sions to split the chairman's functions between a chief execu- tive and a chairman. Investment institutions are attempting to persuade big companies to split these roles. Sir Denys said that in meetings over the summer with sharehold- ers he had been asked whether he planned to split the roles with- out being told that he should. The chief operating officers of IC's seven divisions, who are not board members, will report to Mr HampeL At present, they report to one of three board members: Mr Hampel, Mr David Barnes or Mr Chris Hampson. ICI said yesterday another director, Mr Tom Hutchison, would take early retirement at the end of the year when the responsibilities of board members will be redistributed. This shift will also be helped when Mr Frank Whitely, deputy chairman, retires, probably next year. Mr Hampel will also be in charge of ICIs acquisitions and divestments, its head office and \"all functions which directly affect group operating perfor- mance\", said the company. ICI has been changing itself since Hanson took a 2.8 per cent stake in May. ICI's directors insist the overhaul was taking place anyway and was not prompted by fear of a Hanson bid. However, some directors admit privately they are grateful to Hanson for having accelerated the reform process. Lex, Page 20",

   "text_content" : "IBy Andrew Baxter VICKERS, the UK engineering group, plunged to a Â£4.3m pre-tax loss in the first half of 1991, mainly because of a sharp down- turn in demand for its Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury cars. The loss, which includes E24.3m of exceptional items linked largely to rationalisation costs at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, compared with a profit of Â£39.8m a year earlier. It overshadowed a reasonable performance in Vick- ers' other businesses - defence and aerospace, medical equip- ment and marine engineering. Shares in Vickers fell 20p to 169p after Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive, warned that prospects for the final 1991 dividend depended on an improvement in the outlook at Rolls-Royce. The interim divi- dend was maintained at 3.7p per share. Vickers' results underline the severity of the downturn in the luxury car market. \"At the moment, there is no evidence of any upturn in world markets,\" said Sir David. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sold 3,300 units last year but Vickers declined to say how many cars it hoped to sell this year. Car sales have been running at around half 1990 levels so far this year and the outlook for Rolls-Royce wors- ened in the third quarter with confidence in the Japanese mar- ket shaken by instability in the local financial market. The initial cause of the down- turn was the steep UK and US recession, exacerbated by the US luxury tax introduced in Janu- ary, and the worldwide uncer- tainty caused by the Gulf war. Analysts were more surprised by the dividend warning than the results themselves - pre-tax profits before exceptionals fell from Â£39.8m to Â£20m - but gave Vickers credit for having acted much more promptly to rational- ise its car business than in the previous recession in 1981-82. Sir David said Vickers's results this year would be unsatisfac- tory. After tax and extraordinary items, the first-half loss was Â£13.8m, against a profit of Â£25.3m.

   "text_content" : "Simon London on the rising cost of debt-finance for UK acquistions he recent spate of bids among UK companies could mark the first real test of the willingness of banks to lend for big acquisitions since fears of a \"credit crunch\" first surfaced. Of the three large bids in the market, only one has a cash ele- ment which will be financed with new debt. Hanson's bid for Bea- zer and Williams Holding's bid for Racal Electronics are financed from internal cash resources and new shares. With share prices riding high, predators will try to keep debt finance to a minimum. Past expe- rience shows that a rising stock market encourages acquisitive companies to use equity-related finance. However, there is a limit to the amount of new equity which can be absorbed. In the second quar- ter of this year alone, Â£4bn ordi- nary shares were issued by UK- listed companies, more than in 1989 or 1990. Of the current batch of preda- tors, only BTR, the industrial conglomerate, says it will go to the banks if its Â£1.5bn bid for Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, goes ahead. BTR will look to raise between Â£500m and Â£lbn from a group of banks led by Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse and Hongkong Shanghai Bank. BTR is a good bell-wether of the cost of acquisition finance, having followed a similar pattern of debt finance for its acquisition of Norton in 1990 and proposed acquisition of Pilkington in 1986. In the case of Norton, BTR arranged a $1.5bn one-year sinan- cing at an interest margin of 0.15 per cent over the London inter- bank offered rate. This time around, BTR is again thought to be looking for one- year committed funding. When the details of the financing are published later today, bankers are expecting a margin of at least 0.30 per cent over Libor. Fees have also more than dou- bled in the past year. The Norton financing offered the banks a commitment fee of 0.04 per cent, this time it will be more than 0.10 per cent. While this is expensive, at least BTR has ready access to funds. Smaller, more highly- geared competitors may simply find that acquisition finance is unavailable. That BTR should be first into the loans market is also poi- gnant. In 1987 the company arranged a bank financing which has passed into the folklore of corporate banking as probably the tightest pricing ever seen on a corporate loan in the UK. The Â£lbn multiple option facil- ity, arranged through Bankers Trust in 1987, gave the company access to committed funds over 5% years at the exceptionally fine margin of Just 0.075 per cent over the London interbank offered rate. The loan was a deal whnich led bankers to question the pursuit of market share ahead of lending margin. Several events have changed the attitudes of bankers since 1987, and the trend towards higher financ costs has been amplified over the past year. The first event was the signing in spring 1988 of the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy. The Basle guidelines force banks to maintain a strict capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent, with assets weighted according to risk. Loans to com- panies of any size must be backed by a full 8 per cent capital while loans to governments require no capital backing. While most banks will meet the standard by the January 1993 deadline, bankers admit that the Basle accord has forced them to focus on the efficient use of capi- tal. Bank treasurers weigh up the cost of capital - the cost of servi- cing shares or subordinated debt instruments, for example - against the returns made on assets, such as loans to compa- nies. Each bank has a targeted minimum rate of return on loans, although the target is not dis- closed to outsiders. The impact of the Basle guide- lines was increased by the banks' deteriorating financial health. The weakness of stock prices and land prices in Japan, property losses in the US and the severity of the recession in the UK have all forced banks to review to whom they will lend and at what price. The retrenchment of Japanese banks has been an obvious sign of such pressures. The big five Japanese city banks shrunk assets by nearly 4 per cent last year, having grown by around 20 per cent in each of the previous four years. Of the six lead banks which signed BTR's multiple option facility in 1987, two were Japanese. It may be different this time around. While bank finance is more expensive than in the late 1980s, the main alternative - issuing debt securities directly to inves- tors - has drawbacks as an ini- tial source of acquisition finance. An efficient bond issue needs to be longer than the short one- year to two-years' maturity with which a company such as BTR finances acquisitions. A company which survives by making cash-generative acquisi- tions and trading assets, such as BTR or Hanson, is unlikely to want to lock into acquisition finance over 10 years - particu- larly for an acquisition which may not proceed. In addition, only a respected company with net assets of Â£300m or more could consider launching an international bond issue. Hence even at today's higher prices, banks are the only credi- ble source of acquisition debt finance for most companies in most circumstances. It remains to be seen whether the higher cost of bank finance is an insurmountable obstacle to all but the most determined and accomplished predators. UK ACQUISITIONS ; %0Of.ch 40- o;nib"

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food, furniture and house-building concern, launched a Â£280.7m rights issue yesterday to reduce debt and pay for acquisitions. The l-for-4 issue at 210p did not please the market and the share price fell 11 per cent to 227.5p, at which the group had a value of Â£1.21bn. Earnings per share, which declined by 14.5 per cent last year, are not expected to grow again until 1993. Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said the issue could dilute earnings at worst by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent this year and between 3 per cent and 4 per cent next year. Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said of the issue: \"We are much more comfortable with gearing of 15 per cent than 50 per cent.\" The group planned to develop its food business in Europe and North America, typically by tak- ing advantage of opportunities to buy companies in the Â£25m to Â£50m bracket. Food accounts for more than 80 per cent of the business. Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said net debt had been forecast to fall from Â£494m to about Â£400m this year. The rights issue should bring that year-end figure down to Â£120m. Hillsdown's move last year to take control of Maple Leaf Foods in Canada had incurred C$300m (Â£152m) debt, pushing group bor- rowings above Â£600m. By the end of this year, the C$300m Canadian outlay would have been recouped by disposals and cash management. The sale of Maple's edible oils division, for example, is expected to raise C$100m. Group debt had already been reduced by more than Â£100m since July last year. Nearly a quarter of the rights issue proceeds will go to Canada to enable Hillsdown to partici- pate in Maple's recently announced C$222m share issue to fund acquisitions. It will cost the UK parent C$126m to main- tain its holding at 56 per cent. Leaving aside acquisitions, Sir Harry said Hillsdown had invested Â£400m in the food busi- ness over the past four years to ensure low-cost production. First-half results announced earlier this month showed a slight fall in pre-tax profit to Â£77.6m from Â£78.9m on sales of Â£2.37bn, up from Â£1.88bn last time. Hillsdown last had a rights issue in 1986. But shares have been used to fund acquisitions, notably the Â£195m purchase of Premier Brands in 1989. The pla- cing price then was 255p. Lex, Page 20",

   "text_content" : "Barratt Â£106m in red after Â£84m provisions By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent BARRAiT DEVELOPMENT'S, one of the UK's biggest house- builders, yesterday announced a Â£105.9m pre-tax loss for the year to June 30, against profits last time of Â£30.2m. The com- pany has also re-negotlfaed its Â£200m UK borrowing facility after breaching its loan cove- nants. The losses included provi- sions of Â£84m, of which Â£73m was to cover write-downs in the value of the group's land holdings in southern England and California. In the compara- ble 12 months, the group made pre-tax profits of E30.2m. Sir Lawrie Barratt, who has been brought out of retirement to resume as executive chair- man, said the group's priority was to reduce borrowings which had risen steeply during the past three years. It wasin- tended to do this without resorting to a rights issue. The company intends to raise between $30m and $40m by selling some of its housing land in the US where it was now in the process of re-negoti- ating a $109m (Â£62.6m) loan facility with its US banks. Sir Lawrie said that the interest charge on the UK loan facility had risen only slightly following the successfulre-ne gotiation with the four English and three Scottish clearing banks. In a bid to make savings Bar ratt had, since April, closed unprofitable subsidiaries in the southern England, Los Angeles and Washington DC in the US and and in France. About 200 jobs had been cut. It had also reduced by 20 per cent its stock of unsold houses and cut by 40 per cent the number of unsold homes it holds as a result of part-ex change deals. Net debt at the end of June was Â£159.6m, which was equiv alent to 93 per cent of share holders' funds. Sir Lawrie said he intended to reduce gearing to below 50 per cent, \"back to the levels prevailing when I retired in December 1988 when the group made pre-tax profits that year Correcting previous errors: from left to right, Bob James, group finance director. Sir Lawrie Barratt and Frank of Â£61.5m\". He said it was with great sadness that he had to report the first pre-tax loss incurred by the group since he founded the business in 1958. As a result, it was decided not to pay a final dividend. The interim distribution of 3.21p would stand. Sir Lawrie blamed previous management for purchasing expensive land in southerr England and the US during 1988, 1989 and 1990. He said that falling prices meant the value of this land was now sub stantially below what the group had paid for it. Write-downs on individual sites had been as much as 30 per cent. Sir Lawrie also criticised pre- vious management for failing to control work in progress. Stocks of unsold houses had been excessively high. This was now being corrected by Mr Frank Eaton who replaced Mr John Swanson as chief execu- tive two months ago. There have been a number of senior management changes since Barratt first revealed the size of its losses at the end of July. Among the latest casual- ties is Mr Mark Frazier, who was asked by the Barratt board to resign as chairman of the US operations. He was replaced this week by Mr Michael Nor- ton. * COMMNT If anybody is capable of riding the up and downs of the hous- ing market, it should be Sir Lawrie Barratt. His company has taken on the characteris- tics of a roller-coaster during the 1980s. The current prob- lems caused by the collapse of housing markets in southern England and California have been compounded by the deci- sion to go on buying land after the market had peaked. The plan is to reduce debts by sell- ing some sites in California and by building out and swap- ping sites in southern England. Good housekeeping to keep overheads down will help. The market may have reached bot- tom in the UK and US but recovery is likely to be slow. The group has a long haul ahead. A nominal profit or break-even would be a good performance in the current year. Only for the brave, there- fore - even though the shares at 54p yesterday stand at less than half of their high for the year of 124p. See Observer",

   "article_dc_title" : "AGB Falls Â£13m in Red in Second Half",
   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox AGB International, the UK's largest market research group and part of publisher Mr Rob- ert Maxwell's constellation of private companies, plunged to a Â£13m operating loss in the second half of 1990. The loss compares with a Â£24m profit for the previous 18 months. Earlier this month, Mr Max- well cut the top layer of man- agement from the company, fuelling speculation that it was for sale. The group, which holds the main British Audience Research Bureau contract for UK television audience sam- pling, has been criticised recently by advertising agen- cies for unexpected swings in viewing figures since a new audience panel was introduced in August. Analysts have speculated that Nielsen, the US market research concern, would be interested in the company. Nielsen fought off AGB's attempts to break into lucra- tive US audience measurement but failed in turn to wrest the main UK television contract from AGB. Accounts filed at Companies House show that AGB's central market research businesses incurred an operating loss of Â£2m before rationalisation costs in the six months to December 31 1990, compared with a Â£17.5m profit in the 18 months to the end of June 1990. The slump occurred even though market research turn- over of Â£73.5m was proportion- ately higher in that period, over a third of the Â£207m made in the 18 months. Losses on recruitment and other professional services businesses were Â£300,000 (Â£5.3m profits) and rationalisation of Australian businesses gave an exceptional charge of Â£10.5m, which contributed to the overall operating loss of Â£13.2m. At December 1990 AGB had net debts including finance lease commitments of Â£52.5m, a Â£16m rise in six months. It also had loans from other compa- nies controlled by Headington Holdings, AGB's immediate parent, of Â£61.7m, up from Â£22.3m. The accounts say Head- ington Holdings provided inter- est-free loans. The balance sheet shows negative net assets of Â£1.7m at December 1990, compared to Â£26.5m assets at June 1990. The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis because Robert Maxwell Group, another of Mr Max- well's holding companies, agreed to provide financial support to discharge all liabilities as they fall due.",

The development of our retail business, Williamson Magor Fine Teas, continues according to plan and we have recently purchased tea shops in Winchester. Oxford and Salisbury which are already making a contribution and giving us the opportumity of offering dthe public die vaery best teas both over the counter and in the cup which should help our promotion in a small way. You may have seen advertisements on d television for \"Extra Fresh Teas\" and I would point out that all such vacuum packed teas are grown on our Estates in Assam or Kenya as we are the sole users of this process. Vacuum packed teas remain entirely fresh for years until repacked in the UK and we believe, therefore, that the era of stale teas should be over and this process should promote the sale of our Group's tea at more rewarding prices. With regard to th market, world supply and deand is almost in balance. Prices of our Indian teas have been satisfactory but price of our East African teas continue to be disappointing. The situation in Assam continues to be very unsettled because of the activities of the United Liberation Front for Assam, I regret there has been no improvement, rath e reverse. The Government of India has declared a State of Emer cy, the Army have been called in take control of the State and I am informed they will take stern meare to fight he terrists. It is impossible to foretell de outcome of all this but I hope that situation will at least come under contol and that there will be no fther murders of hostages. In July the newly elecd Indian Govrnment introduced vaious ecomicear which will be of great assistance to us. Many of the procedures regarding exports will be simplfied, which will facilitate thexport of our teas.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy PROFITS AT United Newspapers, the publishing and exhibition group which publishes the Daily and Sun- day Express and the Daily Star, fell by nearly a third in the first half of 1991 because of the effects of recession. Pre-tax profits emerged at Â£38.6m, against Â£56.6m. Lord Stevens, chairman, said: \"We are not assuming an increase in trading activity in the remaining months of the year, but we do expect to see an overall improvement in the second-half results.\" The results were slightly above expectations and the shares rose 14p to 398p. Turnover, at Â£411.2m, was slightly down on last year's Â£423.7m, though earnings per share at 11.8p were down by 34 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 7.5p. Lord Stevens said that Â£13m had been trimmed from the cost base since the beginning of the year: 18 magazines were sold and 12 closed. Most were small. The volume of national newspaper advertising was marginally up and the Daily Express and the Daily Star maintained their circulations against a 4 per cent fall in the popular newspaper market. The Sunday Express fell 6 per cent, 1 per cent worse than the Sunday popular market, before the effects of recent edi- torial changes. Reductions in classified and display advertising hit United's regional newspapers but trade shows and exhibitions gener- ally remained strong. Lord Stevens said that fol- lowing the end of re-equipment programmes United's capital expenditure was now returning to more normal levels and an improvement in cash genera- tion would result. Mr Derek Terrington, of Kleinwort Benson, is forecast- ing pre-tax profits of Â£88m for the full year and warned yes- terday that United could be slow to come out of recession. Debt would also not be out of the way for another year.",

Mr Allister McLeish, finance director, said that the group, which operates in about 70 markets worldwide, was able to increase sales to Â£127.4m (Â£118.4m) as the group focused more strongly on new sectors and new outlets for its wide range of products. The EC mar- kets were particularly resilient, he said. The speciality chemicals division increased its profits contribution to Â£8.45m (Â£7.49m) as business picked up towards the latter part of the first half. Several of its speciality chemi- cals achieved record sales, the group said, and the division won new customers as well as achieving moderately higher margins.while building prod- ucts also saw an improved per- formance with pre-tax contri- butions rising to Â£3.9m (Â£3.05m). mainly on the strength of its continental European business. There was a first-time contri- bution from Unilock, the office partitions company it acquired in August last year. The agriculture and land division, based on the Malay- sian plantation, incurred a loss of Â£5,000 (Â£987,000 profit) before it was sold. The sale of the Malaysian plantation in January, brought in an extraordinary profit of Â£4.56m. It also resulted in lower minority interests and a lower tax charge, which together led to a substantial rise in retained profit at Â£8.64m (Â£3.44m). The Malaysian disposal also reduced borrowings to Â£24m at the end of June. This enabled the group to limit the rise in its interest charge to Â£1.76m (Â£1.49m). Gearing was at 62 per cent but interest cover was unchanged at 6.5 times for the first half. The group expects to see positive cash flow towards come through to the end of the year, Mr McLeish said.

   "text_content" : "SANSUI ELECTRIC, a sub- sidiary of Polly Peck Interna- tional, yesterday said it would report a Y18.6bn (Â£80.17m) loss in the first half of the year, following a decision to take provisions on part of the Y67.8bn in loans extended to Capetronic, its Taiwanese sub- sidiary. Sansui said the decision to take provisions was prudent in view of the poor performance of the company, which was purchased from Polly Peck in May 1990 as part of a general restructuring of the two groups' consumer electronics operations in the Far East. News of the losses took the market by surprise, coming only a day after Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, senior administrator for Polly Peck, presented proposals to the San- sul board under which Sansui shares would be sold to Grande Holdings of Hong Kong, an electronics manufacturer con- trolled by Mr Stanley Ho, the Macau casino tycoon. Yester- day Sansui would not comment but it is thought to be cool towards the idea. Sansui said it expected even- tually to be able to recover the lending, but that this would not be until the business of its subsidiaries recovered. Capetronic, a manufacturer of electronic components bought by Polly Peck in 1988, was a financially strong com- pany until it ran into difficul- ties last autumn. The merger between the two companies was intended to restore Sansui to profitability in 1990 through dividends remitted from Cape- tronic. Before accounting for the bad loan provisions, Sansui reported a pre-tax loss of Y3.39bn, in spite of increasing sales. Sansui said its sales in the first half were Y8.9bn, a 5.4 per cent rise compared to the second and third quarter of last year, before Sansui changed its fiscal year. The company said it expec- ted to post a Y19bn loss for the whole year, although this fig- ure could be lower if Sansui elected to make further bad Proceedings against Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck International, will be transferred to the Old Bailey on November 7, Bow Street magistrates ruled yesterday. Mr Nadir, who was remanded on ball of 38.5m until then, faces 18 charges of theft and false account- ing involving 225m. The charges were origi- nally brought against him by the Serious Fraud Office in December last year fol- lowing a three-month investigation. The direct transfer to Crown Court takes place under the recently intro- duced procedure allowing large fraud cases to by-pass committal proceedings before a magistrates court. loan provisions. Details of the merger plans revealed yesterday suggest that Grande would take a 32 per cent stake in Sansui, the Tokyo-listed electronics subsid- iary of Polly Peck Interna- tional, and is seeking permis- sion from the Tokyo stock exchange to raise its stake to 51 per cent before the end of the year. The 32 per cent stake would be in return for a loan of up to $50m (Â£28.7m) as working capi- tal for Sansui and some man- agement support. If the Tokyo stock exchange gives permission for the stake to be raised without the need for a general offer, a joint ven- ture between Grande and Semi Tech, owner of the Singer sew- ing machine trademark, will acquire a further 19 per cent at about Y250 per share. If that transaction is approved, Sansui's audio prod- ucts will be marketed through Singer's retail network, which has excess capacity. Semi Tech would also offer Singer's installment payment system to purchasers of Sansui equip- ment in markets like Mexico and Thailand. 0 In a separate development, Del Monte Foods of the US yes- terday filed a lawsuit in a fed- eral district court in New York, against Polly Peck Interna- tional and its subsidiaries, alleging breach of contract, unfair competition and infringement of Del Monte's trademark rights. In September 1989 Polly Peck paid $875m to acquire the fresh fruit operations of the Del Monte group. The rest of Del Monte, including the processed food business, became a sepa- rate independent company last year when it was acquired from RJR Nabisco in a lever- aged buy-out by its manage- ment and Merrill Lynch, the New York securities house.

   "text_content" : "By Mihy Ntakamat/ DEPRESSED PRICES and excess capacity in Its reces sion-hit markets slashed pre tax profits at Ibstock Johnsen, the bricks and forestry prod. acts group, from Â£22.2m to E7.2m in the six months to the end of June. \"These are dire times,\" com- mented Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director. Ibstock's core brick business was hit by continuing weak ness in its main markets, while its forest products division sus- fered from low pulp prices. There was nothing to sug gest that the full year would be better, Mr Maclellan added. \"We cannot align ourselves with politicians who tell us we are coming out of the reces- sion,\" he said. The building products divi- sion, which is dependent on the severely depressed UK commercial market and the US housing market, suffered both from lower demand and mar- gins because of the combined effects of high stocks and excess capacity. Profits from building prod- ucts were halved at Â£7.51m- (214.9m). In the first half UK brick prices fell by 16 per cent. In the US the loss increased tM .7Mfnnn I-fr nfllA Uninaisi starts in the north east, the primary market, were down by 22 par cent and were expected to be below Im units in 1981 - the lowest level since statistics were started. Its European business saw trading profits down to Â£1.57m (Â£1.78m). Promising demand came for its premium brand bricks from Japan. Pulp business was depressed by the fall in prices and the division reversed into a Â£586,000 loss (Â£6.74m profit). Mr Maclellan warned that it would be \"over-optimistic\" to expect results this year to exceed those of 1990. Earnings per share fell to The7 (&7P). einterim divi- n is Aantained t 2.25p. Even in the lirht of the depressed state a the market for building materials these are sobering figures indeed. The group, which is remarkably straightforward about its prob lems, is the first to admit that there is little scope for much improvement inithe immediate fiture either in the building materials or pulp operation. There is also a creeping worry that the steps it has taken, commendable as they are, hav siml -ome too late.

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto FROM stereos to cars, Japanese products seem set to dominate many world mar- kets, but there is one product for which the quality-con- scious Japanese have had to scour the world in their search for the very best - bricks. They found their choice in Britain. More than 1.2m British bricks manufactured by Ibstock Johnsen have been shipped at enormous expense across 10,000 miles of sea to build a hotel in a resort town just outside Osaka, Japan's second largest city. For the past 18 months, 20,000 bricks were shipped off each week and sent on the five-week Journey to their des- tination, where local Japanese bricklayers used what brick- laying skills they have to build the Kawakyu Hotel, scheduled to open in Shira- hama in November. Ibstock, which has faced a difficult trading environment in its main markets in the US and Europe, Is hopeful that a new fashion for bricks could take off in Japan. The Japanese paid Â£1.8m for the bricks alone, making the average price close to Â£1 a brick, or five times the 20p that a standard brick would cost \"in these diffcult times\", says Mr Philip Beardsworth, a designer for Ibstock who is closely involved in the project. Ibstock won the contract on the strength of the entire package of standard and designed bricks it could offer, and of its manufacturing capa- bilities, Mr Beardsworth said. The Japanese architect of the hotel had come across Ibstock on his tour of the UK in search of a manufacturer that could do the job, he said. Limited language abilities on both sides meant that meet- ings mostly Involved each side passing sketches across the negotiating table. But the silent interchange paid off in the end. A total of 800,000 ordinary shaped bricks of Leicester cream and Cheddar golden were chosen to be comple- mented by another 400,000 special-shape bricks, of which there were 72 different types. The hotel will feature trian- gular bricks on elevator shafts, bricks with barley sugar profiles capping ellipti- cal staircase towers. \"It's an Interesting mix of eastern and western styles,\" Mr Beard- sworth said. Japan manufactures about 60m bricks a year, which is insignificant compared even with Ibstock's 320m in the UK and another 500m in the US.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger TRAVIS PERKINS, the UK's fifth largest builders' mer- chant, contributed to the gen- erally grim news in the UK construction sector with a 60 per cent drop in interim pre- tax profits to Â£5.47m. Mr Tony Travis, chairman, also warned that the second half would \"not be much bet- ter\" than the first six months. \"But hopefully it won't be much worse,\" he added. Turnover was down 12.5 per cent to Â£156.1m in both volume and value. The housing slow- down in the Midlands and south-east, where the group is based, had severely affected demand. Travis derives just over 70 per cent of its sales from housing repair, mainte- nance and improvement. Mr Travis said the results had been \"pretty bad all round\". Net operating margins were slashed from 7 to 3.2 per cent and bad debts were Â£1.7m - about three times higher than in normal conditions. However, Mr Travis said the group had maintained gross margins at 30 per cent. He said the group's position had stabi- lised since last year, although there was no sign of any improvement. \"We are concentrating on cutting costs and reducing our stocks,\" said Mr Travis. The company cut 10 per cent of its staff during the six months. Earnings per share plunged by 5.3p to 3.8p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p. * COMMENT Grim, grim and grimmer, said Mr Travis, finding little silver in his particular cloud. In fact, there might be some good news: although the market has declined some 14 per cent, Travis Perkins has seen sales fall just over 12 per cent. Preoc- cupation with the 1988 merger may also have kept the group from succumbing to the gran- diose expansion plans of com- petitors now struggling with high debt and gearing. Travis Perkins boasts a nil debt posi- tion. Cost-cutting is winning praise, although the bad debt position has edged the group's cost base up by about 4 per cent. Forecasts were pushed up a bit to between Â£12m and Â£14m after encouraging noises on the property disposal front. The prospective p/e of 23 to 24 looks high, however, and shares are expensive at the moment."

COMMENT I. Against the background of deteriorating economies both domestically within South Africa and internationally, the companies in the group performed well and it is pleasing to report profit attributable to the holders of permanent equity instruments of almost R57m for the six months to 30 June 1991. This is more than double the figure of a year ago and reflects the reorganisation of the group's assets which was effective from 1 July 1990. In this reorganisation W&A Investment Corporation became the holding company for the group's assets with Waicor, FSI Corporation and FS Group becoming pyramid companies. 2. The group's restructuring and an increase in the number of permanent equity instruments in issue in W & A by 118,1% slightly diluted W & A's earnings per share. Earnings per share of 34,8 cents are 5,2% lower than the comparable earnings figure of 36,7 cents for the same period a year ago 3. The interim dividend has been maintained at 15,5 cents a share. 4. Highlights of the past six months' trading include the completion of the establishment of the JD consumer finance company mentioned in the 1990 annual report and the acquisitions of Alloy Wheels International and Unit-span Modular Building by our UK based subsidiary, AAF Investment Corporation. In spite of the more difficult trading conditions, most of our companies maintained or increased their market shares. The decline in the margin of operating profit to turnover at 10,3% compared with 11,1% a year ago indicates how competitive trading has been. However, our companies addressed the key issues of overhead efficiencies and working capital management and succeeded in holding their market positions. 5. Net interest paid increased by 64,3% mainly as a result of interest relating to the acquisition of off-shore businesses within AAF and the increase in working capital required to finance the 34,8% higher turnover. it is anticipated that for the full 12 months the level of increase in interest paid will be lower as cash flows through to W & A's subsidiary, J D Group, from the sale of the JD debtors book to a consumer finance company and as a result of the group's lower gearing. 6. The group's gearing, excluding plant revaluation, has declined from 67,4% at 31 December 1990 to 59.9% at 30 June 1991 and on a revalued basis falls from 47,9% to 43,1%. This is considered to be satisfactory as June is the high point of the group's funding. The traditional seasonal decline in borrowings (adjusted for the funding of VAT) will result in a further reduction in gearing by the end of the financial year. Management will continue to give strict attention to asset management. 7. The group's tax rate at 9,4%, while substantially lower than 23,3% of a year ago because of capital allowances effective in certain of our subsidiary companies, is in line with the tax rate of 10,4% which applied for the previous full financial year. It is expected that the group's tax rate will not rise much above the present levels for the next couple of years. 8. As a result of the ongoing investment programme in our businesses and the acquisitions made to expand our core businesses, total assets rose by some RI78m. The prime areas of investment were the two AAF acquisitions and increases in our tyre, formwork and scaffolding and hosiery businesses. PROSPECTS 1. We do not expect trading conditions to improve in the current six months of the financial year and re-iterate the forecast made at our annual general meeting that earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, for the year ending 31 December 1991 may well be some 10% Iower than those achieved in 1990. 2. In line with our stated objectives the group is in the process of finalising certain international allances. These alliances will assist our companies to acceerae the development of their export markets and ensure that the standards of our businesses remain competitive locally and inter- nationally in addtion these alliances will assist our companies to defend their esabisled market against competitors iely to eter the South African marfet place in the new. sanctions-free erironmer, through supplying our companies with marlet place technology and providing them with access to proprietary, state-he technology These strategic moves which also have the effect of furthecr reducing gearing will not affect cotrol of any of the grop's core businesses as the group does not plan to dispose of control of any of its core businesses 3. In the light of the above and the positive longer term outlook for the group the total dividend for the year will be maintained at 42 cents a share.

Sir Colln Chandler, manag- ing director, said the market for tanks such as, the Chal- lenger was largely in the Gulf, and Vickers was going after a number of opportunities. The British order was the biggest Vickers had received, and an immense boost to its hopes for further success in export markets. This, the group said, would make a sig- nificant contribution to the growth through the 1990s. The British order was still two years from reaching pro- duction, and the real financial impact would come from 1994 to 1997. The results were dominated by the substantial downturn in demand at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, but analysts said the per- formance of the rest of the group was creditable in light of the recession. Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive, said all other main activities were con- tinuing to perform satisfacto- rily, In particular the medical division, a world leader in neo- natal intensive care products, neurodiagnostic systems and intensive care patient monitor- ing, was doing better than last year, said Sir David. Cosworth, the UK high-per- formance engine company acquired last year, had per- formed slightly better than in 1990, while results of the marine engineering division were about the same.

   "text_content" : "jdy anm Luller S JIM Maxmin has promised to make some sweeping kchanges at Laura Ashley, the fashion and furnishings group which he has just joined as *chief executive. . \"More professional manae- Jnent techniques will generate a ton more cash,\" said the American-born Mr Maxmin, who was presenting a set of figures that applied to the half- year before he arrived. Pre-tax profit improved to Â£528,000 (Â£317,000) in the six months to July 27. The full 1990-91 results had shown a Â£6.7m loss. Before Mr Maxmin arrived, Laura Ashley's prospects were revived by painful rationalisa- tion, involving 1,500 jobs losses and seven factory closures, the sale of non-core businesses and a Â£30m cash injection from the Aeon Group of Japan, which has a 15 per cent stake. The new chief executive said he had set up a task force to review overheads, particularly at head offices in the UK, on the continent and in North America. \"The main way to reduce cost will be to eliminate activity.\" He had found the group to be far too complex. He also envisaged Â£3m of capital spending on upgrading systems, including the tills, bar coding and stock location. \"At the moment there are three or four different systems and no world-wide view.\" The group, which is con- trolled by Sir Bernard Ashley, chairman, has just over 500 outlets of which 197 are inthe US, 174 in the UK and 60 on the Continent. It has switched away from making most of its goods in-house. Only 22 per cent are now made in Laura Ashley plants, with a further 25M0 per cent coming from other UK suppliers. First-half turnover fell to Â£132.2m (Â£173.9m), although disposals accounted for nearly Â£25m of the decline. Operating profit slid to Â£383,000 from Â£7.1m, or Â£5.8m on a compara- ble basis. Profits were hit by reduced volumes and low gross mar- gins during the July sales. The performance would have been worse without Â£5m of opera- tional savings arising from last year's rationalisation. Interest costs were greatly reduced at Â£1.4m (Â£7m). Net debt, which was Â£89m before the Aeon deal, had come down to Â£13.4m by July. Earnings per share were 0.12p (0.02p), after a 48 per cent tax charge. The interim divi- dend is again passed. * COMMENT Most of Mr Maxmin's message was music to the ears. For instance: \"We have to get mar- gin out of the sales we have\" Tror Humphries Jim Maxmin: promised some sweeping changes - is the right thing to say about a company that was partly spoilt by a cost-uncon- scious drive for sales. The won- derful word \"prudence\" was also used about future pros- pects, with Mr Maxmin budget- ing for flat sales over the next 18 months. However, that would already be an improve- ment after a worrying 12 per cent sales fall in the UK stores, which lost money, and an 11 per cent decline in the US. The question is that after the mar- keting message - and some of the jargon, such as \"over-facli- tised\", was over the top - will the company really be fixed? At a share price of 87p, the company would have to make Â£20m pre-tax profit next year to be on the average stores rating of 15 times earnings. As Â£lm seems all that can be expected this year, there is such a long way to go that prudence sug- gests it is worth waiting until at least some of the figures speak louder than the words.",

No. 63/06144/06 (Both companies incorporated in the Republic of South Africa) Highlights from the Chairmen's Reviews Rustenburg Platinum Distributable profit for the year was R604 million, the highest ever recorded by the company. Gross sales revenue increased to R3,43 billion, a 16,4% increase, due mainly to the higher rhodium price achieved and notwithstanding the lower dollar and rand prices received for the other platinum group metals. Operating profit increased by only 3,8% to R1,52 billion due to the impact ofa 23,9% increase in the cost of sales. An increased final dividend of 225 cents was declared, making a total of 350 cents for the year; an increase of 12,9%. The precious metals refinery's operations achieved several milestones with regard to output levels. During 1990 the platinum market moved into surplus for the first time since 1984. Although demand is estimated to have grown to a record 3,66 million ounces, supplies grew to an estimated 3,73 million ounces. Platinum is trading at levels not seen since January 1986 in current money terms and July 1985 in real terms. Fundamentally demand is firm but market sentiment is weak. Prices have declined to current low levels in spite of encouraging indications that the US auto industry is looking forward to an improved fourth quarter and that the US economy as a whole is beginning to recover Reports from Japan indicate an ongoing growth in platinum demand throughout the rest of 1991. Rustenburg's regular in-depth reviews confirm that platinum will remain the dominant PGM component in the autocatalyst sector The JCI Group of platinum producers are the best placed in the industry not only to exploit the opportunities but also to cope with any other developments that might be in store for the industry. The forty-fifth annual general meeting ofRustenburg Platinum Holdings Limited will be held in Johannesburg on 24 October 1991 at 10h30. Lebowa Platinum Gross sales revenue for the year increased by 44% to Rl11,9 million as a result of a higher volume of metal sales and a dramatic increase in the price of rhodium. The effect of the higher volume of platinum sold was partially offset by lower prices. Labour problems caused the mine to fall short of its production target. The adverse impact on unit costs plus the ongoing effect of inflation on working costs and the erosion of metal stocks, caused a 62% increase in the cost of sales to R93,9 million. Profit on metal sales declined by 19%to R14,1 million. In view of the results and capital commitments no dividend was declared. The progress made towards the production target of 70,000 tons per month, which should be reached during the last quarter of 1991, has been considerable in the light of the extremely difficult circumstances experienced. The 100,000 ton per month expansion programme is on budget and due for completion in the last quarter of 1992. The spread of clean air legislation, the ever increasing allure of the metal injewellery and the development of new uses, particularly in fuel cells will ensure growing demand for platinum. The twentieth annual general meeting ofLebowa Platinum Mines Limited will be held in Johannesburg on 24 October 1991 at *030.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney THE AUSTRALIAN Securities Commission has given BTR an exemption from federal corpo- rations law to avoid complica- ting the group's Â£1.5bn hostile bid for Hawker Siddeley. The ASC announced the exemption after BTR agreed to buy out minority shareholders of two Australian subsidiaries of Hawker Siddeley if it secures 20 per cent or more of the group's shares. Without the exemption, BTR would have risked breaching section 615 of the corporations law, which prevents the indi- rect acquisition of Australian companies through the pur- chase of an overseas parent. Hawker Siddeley owns 70 per cent of Hawker de Havilland, a listed Australian aircraft maker, and 85 per cent of Westinghouse Brake & Signal (Australia), a railway equip- ment company. The ASC said BTR or BTR Nylex, the group's Australian subsidiary, would make an offer for all the outstanding shares in both companies within a month of becoming entitled to 20 per cent of Hawker Siddeley stock. The offer would have to be in cash or cash and shares, based on valuations by two independent experts acceptable to the ASC, and would have to remain open for three months. The potential cost of the agreement to BTR or BTR Nylex is unclear, but would probably be less than A$50m (Â£23m), based on the companies market capitalisation. . The agreement would lapse if the BTR bid fails to be declared unconditional within three months, or if the federal Treasurer uses his powers to prohibit the acquisition of shares. It could also lapse if the Trades Practices Commis- sion or Foreign Investment Review Board intervene under legislation governing competi- tion and foreign investments. The agreement also covers Hawker Siddeley's 24 per cent holding in Bunnings, a timber and hardware group. BTR #as given an undertak- ing to vote only 19.9 per cent of the stock, and to acquire no further shares for two years should it succeed in its bid.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd FROGMORE ESTATES, which recently defeated a hostile bid from Southend Property, yes- terday announced a 48 per cent fall in taxable profits for the year to end-June 1991. The decline, from Â£7.lm to Â£4m, was blamed on the prop- erty recession. There was an extraordinary charge of Â£1..8m incurred in the defence against the bid. Mr David Wilmot, finance direc- tor, said: \"We feel very aggrieved at having to spend that sort of money defending ourselves against a bid which stood little chance of success.\" Profits were struck after providing Â£2.26m (Â£3.52m) to reduce the cost of trading properties to their estimated net realisable value. Below the line there was a Â£2.58m (Â£14.1m) net surplus on sale of investment properties. Last year's Â£41m borrowings were eliminated through a series of property disposals. Mr Wilmot said the company was well positioned to make some \"opportunistic acquisi- tions\" over the next year. Some Â£20m had been invested in low cost housing though a series of joint ven- tures, taking advantage of reduced land prices. The flnal dividend is 10.6p making a total of 18.8p (12.3p). Earnings came to 7.2p (14.8p). Net assets per share fell from 523p to 449p.",

Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of the commercial breakfast television company, said it had continued to outperform the rest of ITV in spite of the most difficult trading conditions for many years. Its share of ITV advertising revenue rose from 4.84 per cent to 5.01 per cent, although actual revenues fell by 3.3 per cent compared with a drop of 6.8 per cent for ITV as a whole. Turnover totalled Â£39.6m (Â£4L.45m). Earnings per share fell to 6.5p (11.1p) but the interim dividend is unchanged . Gyngell said that cover- age of the Gulf war, which pro- duced TV-am's highest ever audiences, had increased costs by Â£1.2m. There also had been a rise in marketing costs and a 21 per cent lift in its subscrip- tion to the funding of Channel 4. \"We submitted our applica- tion for the new breakfast tele- vision licence on May 15, and we remain confident of suc- cess,\" Mr Gyngell said. There is, however, a growing expectation in the television industry that TV-am will be one of the losers when the Independent Television Com- mission announces new broad. casting licences next month. TV-am had been outbid by two strong consortia - Sunrise, which included London Week- end Television, The Guardian and Disney; and Daybreak which groups Independent Television News, NBC of the US, Conrad Black and Carlton Communications. Mr Gyngell had been looking for alternative outlets if he should lose. There was an approach to offer the TV-am service to Channel 4 but that was declined.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor MURRAY VENTURES has bucked the bad news trend from investment trusts which specialise in unquoted stocks by announcing a 13 per cent rise in the final dividend and a 12 per cent increase in net assets over the six months to July 31. The trust has 40 per cent of its portfolio in the quoted sec- tor which helped its recovery, but it also upgraded its unquoted investments by 4 per cent in the second half. Over the year as a whole, however, net asset value fell 9.2 per cent to 306p per share. A number of trusts which invest in unquoted stocks have recently announced asset write-downs as a result of the recession's effect on the small company sector. Investors have become suspicious that unquoted stocks are valued on investment trusts' balance sheets at over-optimistic levels. As a result, trusts in this field stand at substantial discounts to their asset values. Murray Ventures said, how ever, that its valuation meth- ods were very conservative and almost match the recent guide- lines published by the British Venture Capital Association. Substantial provisions were made in both July 1990 and January this year. Revenue before tax for 1990W91 was Â£3.98m (23.8m) and earnings per share were 12.04p (11.99p). The final dividend of 6.9p makes a total of 10.3p (9.35p). Looking ahead, the company said that \"whilst the unlisted companies are benefiting from the reductions in interest rates, as yet there is little sign of improved trading conditions. However, the worst is over and as the economy continues to pick up so should our unlisted companies.\"",

   "text_content" : "LVM H MOET HENNESSY. LOUIS VUITTON STRONG RECOVERY IN THE SECOND QUARTER Despite a decline in sales during the Gulf war and unfavorable worldwide economic conditions, LVMH's income from operations for the first half of 1991 amounted to FS 2345 million, slightly ahead of corresponding period in 1990. Following a decrease in the first quarter of the year, consolidated income from operations mse by 20% in the second quarter. LVMH's consolided net income for the first six months of 1991 totalled FS 1,210 million, as compared to FS 1,248 million in the first half of 1990. The slight decrease in first half net income results from an increase in financial expenses related to the purchase of Guinness shares in 1990 and to the Champagne Pommney acquisition in early 1991. The impact of these financial expenses will be relatively less in the second half of the year, due to the seasonality of Guinness's and Pommery's sales and income. On a comparable structural basis - notably, by giving effect on a pro forma basis from January 1, 1990 to LVMH's 24% stake in Guinness and the acquisition of Pommery - and using constant accounting methods, net income would have increased by 7%. Taking into account the strong recovery in sales being recorded by Group's various segments, the favorable trade reactions to two newly launched women's perfumes, \"Dune\" by Christian Dior and \"Amarige\" by Civenchy, and the stronger exchange rates of the dollar and yen against the French franc in the third quarter of the year, the anticipation of a reasonable increase in LVMH's profits for the year as a whole is confirmed. By segment of activity, net sales and income from operations developed as follows: Soles In millions of French francs 1991 1990 Champagne & wines 1,951 1,839 Cognac & spirits 2,813 2,454 Luggage & leaher goods 2,151 2,180 Perfumes & beauty products 2,051 2,167 Other 298 181 LVMH 9,264 8,821 Income from operations In millions of French francs 1991 1990 Champagne & wines 272 328 Cognac & spirits 1,243 1,102 Luggage & leather goods 827 881 Perfumes & beauty products 121 138 Other (118) (115) LVMH 2,345 2,334 LVMH, WORLD'S LEADING A drop in champagne sales in certain recessionary markets, notably the US and UK, affected the segment's first half performance. However, in this segment, over 60% of sales are traditionally generated in the second halfoftheyear. The cognac profitability increased significantly, thanks to a futher increase in the proportion of older quality cognacs, continued sales growth in the Far East, in the recoveryofJapaneseyen. By the end of June, sales of the luggage segment had practically recovered from the negative impact of the Gulf war. The strong sales recovery which got under- way in the spring continued through the summer. Sales of perfumes and beauty products, affected by the Gulf crisis, in duty-free outlets, have rebounded in the second quarter, in a recovery which continued though the summer. In the first six months of the year, Guinness PLC recorded pre-tax income of 350 million pounds up 9% over thecorresponding 1990 period LUXURY PRODUCTS GROUP Chargeurs 1991 interim results First Half Year 1991 1990 1990 Net sales 5,287 6,105 10,988 (in FS millions) Net income 404 1,539 527 (in FS millions) Net earnings per share 67.11 243.34 84.80 (FS) Net sales to 30 June 1991 were down 13.4 % from the comparable figures at the end of June 1990. This decline was mainly due to the fall in wool prices, which occured in February 1991. Net income was down 73.7%. However, before extraordinary items (capital gains on the sale of the Air Transport segment), net income is an improvement over the 1990 figure. The upturn in the world wool market which has been experienced since spnng 1991, the reorganisation carried out since 1989 by the woolen fabrics division (to be completed by the end of 1991) and the steady increase in BSkyB's satellite television audience, can be considered as favourable factors. These factors allow us to confirm our hope for a significant improvement in the 1992 results. CHARGEURS Chargeurs - 5, boulevard Malesherbes 75008 Paris R&ASSOCIES DIVIDEND INCREASED BY 5% 1t.

   "text_content" : "Tim Coone on Michael Smurfit's resignation from Telecom Eireann M JR MICHAEL Smurfit, Ireland's leading industrialist, has had little time in recent weeks to attend to Jefferson Smurfit, his international packaging com- pany, the basis of his fame ana fortune. On his home turf, he has fought but lost the fight to remain chairman of Telecom Eireann following controversy over a property deal involving the state-owned telephone com- pany. Meanwhile in the UK he remains a key figure in the survival of Brent Walker, the leisure group. Unless the com- pany's advisers can find a tor- tuous formula to satisfy Mr Smurfit and other bondholders on the one hand and the banks on the other, Brent Walker wiL shortly end up in the hands of the receivers. Mr Smurfit resigned fromn Telecom a bitter man. What is widely regarded as a brilliant business career has now fallen foul of what eventually may prove to have been political skulduggery aimed at Mr Charles Haughey, the prime minister and his government, rather than Mr Smurfit. Mr Smurfit came into the public sector in 1979, when enlightened governinent policy began to bring in the best and brightest from the private sec- tor to improve civil service effi ciency. Still keeping a hands-on approach to the running of Jefferson Smurfit, which he chairs, he turned around Ireland's telecommunications company from a sprawling and ponderous concern costing the taxpayer IÂ£100m-a-year to sup port, to a profitable dynamic company, which last year made a profit of IE94m (Â£86m) profit. It is now regarded as one of Europe's best-run tele- communications companies. It was controversy over a property deal to build Tele com's new headquarters though, which ensnarled Mr Smurfit. He resigned earlier this week after Mr Haughey had publicly suggested that Mr Smurfit should temporarily step aside as chairman until an inquiry into the deal was complete. Mr Smurfit was born in Lan- cashire 55 years ago and in 1969 became deputy chairman of the family paper and pack- aging business, which his father had established in Dub- lin in the 1940s. He became the driving force behind the group's interna- tional expansion after it went Michael Smurfit: concentrating on Jefferson Smurfit .. public on the Dublin stock exchange in 1964, and which converted the local box-making company into what is now the fifth largest paper and packag- ing business in the world. He became group chairman in 1977 following his father's death. Spotting undervalued paper and packaging firms in the UK and US, he bought them, turned them round and greatly increased their value. His biggest move came in 1986, when with Morgan Stanley, the US merchant bank, he acquired Container Corpora- tion of America,(CCA). This led to expansion in Latin America and Europe. In 1989, Mr Smurfit surprised the financial world, by spear- heading a daring restructuring of its US operations, which released almost IElbn in cash, and thereby creating a war chest for group expansion, focusing on Europe, in the fol- lowing decade. One investment fund man- ager in Dublin said, \"In his core business, he has been bril- liant, by knowing his market, spotting opportunities, and knowing when to move.\" It was those abilities which made Jefferson Smurfit into one of Ireland's most success- ful companies with an average growth of 30 per cent per year in share value over the past 27 years since the company went public. It has earned Mr Smurfit an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, a Legion d'Honneur award from the French government, and he has twice been voted \"Man of the Year\" by Ireland's Business and Finance maga- zine. But envy has also accompan- ied acclaim. Mr. Smurfit has perhaps been a victim of what one Irish friend described as a \"perverse desire to knock down the successful and those who make a name for them- selves\". It was clear from the acres of innuendo in the press reports during the past week, that this national sport was again being indulged in Mr Smurfit's case. He admitted in his resigna- tion statement that he should possibly have been aware of an \"historical link\" between a property company UPH, in which he has a 10 per cent stake, and a chain of transac- tions which led to Telecom's ownership of a construction site for its new headquarters. However, he added: \"The fact is that I was not.\" That one slip has cost him his chairmanship of Telecom, although he is emphatic that neither he nor his family made any financial gain, or were in any way involved in the site's subsequent sale to Telecom. A government inquiry has been set up to verify this. Mr Smurfit has also faced criticism for his decision to get involved in Brent Walker. Sev- eral years ago, the Smurfit group began a 1300m diversifi- cation into the leisure indus- try. When Brent Walker made a Â£l00m issue of convertible bonds in a refinancing package last year Mr Smurfit put up Â£10m of his own money. Jeffer- son Smurfit bought another Â£15m, although he abstained from the board vote on the decision. Brent Walker was to be involved in a joint venture to develop the group's leisure activities in Ireland. Mr Howard Kilroy, president of Jefferson Smurfit, justified the move saying: \"It had a sound, healthy balance sheet and a good earnings stream. That has turned out not to be the case\". He added that legal action may be considered in due course if it proved that false information was given in the bond issue. Referring to the Telecom affair, Mr Kilroy said: \"We all feel sore at the way he (Mr Smurfit) was treated.\" Ques- tions are being raised as to whether the government will now be able to find people of Mr Smurfit's business calibre to run state-sector companies and whether the government's privatisation programme will now falter. Mr Smurfit had a word of warning for his public sector colleagues. \"Do not lose hope, and continue to give public ser- vice.\" But he added: \"Make sure what happened to me does not happen to you.\" As Mr Smurfit returns full-time to the boardroom of Jefferson Smurfit, there is a sense that the cloud under which he has left Telecom, might ultimately rain more on Mr Haugheyas the opposition calls for more heads to roll in the numerous controversies to have rocked his government in recent weeks.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger MARGINS AT Eleco Holdings, the building products and distribution company, took a battering from the recession and pre-tax profits fell 45 per cent from Â£5.58m to Â£3.35m over the year to June 30. Operating profits plunged 81 per cent to Â£1.65m (Â£4.75m) on turnover down from Â£63.4m to Â£56.8m. Excluding discontinued operations, which were largely Eleco's property devel- opment activities, the decline in trading profits would have been 65 per cent. Eleco aims to complete its programme of property disposals by the end of the cur- rent year. About Â£12m was raised last year, cutting net debt from Â£25.4m to Â£16m. Gearing was too high at 75.5 per cent, but Mr Michael Webster, chief executive, said that the group planned to be totally ungeared within 18 months. Interest gains jumped sharply to Â£1.28m (Â£9,000), the result of a squeeze on working capital and property disposals. Eleco had performed well in a difficult environment, Mr Webster said. \"In our special areas, I think we have performed better than other companies.\" Eleco enjoys leading market positions in several of its niche building product areas, such as nail plates used in timber roofs, and metal casings for power cables. However, the building products division overall had suffered a 65 per cent decline in profits, due to the sharp squeeze on margins. The distribution business had performed better than expected, Mr Webster said, with a 17 per cent decline in profits on increased turnover. Earnings per share fell 46 per cent to 7.3p (13.6p) and the final dividend is cut to 2.3p (3.9p), making a reduced total of 4.6p (6.2p).",

   "article_dc_title" : "Fiat Falls to L1,455bn and Warns of Tough Conditions",
   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan in Milan FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector industrial group yesterday announced a fall in pre-tax profits to L1,455bn ($1.15bn) from L2,454bn for the first six months of 1991. The setback was incurred despite a one-off gain of at least L500bn from the sale of the Telettra and Cavis subsid- iaries. According to analysts, the decision to take all the gain this year reflects the group's current difficulties. Fiat warned that tougher economic conditions, to which it largely attributed its profits fall, could continue into 1992. It gave no earnings forecast for 1991 as a whole, but said turn. over would be \"not less\" than the L49,882bn in 1990. Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chair- man, said this week he expec- ted the second half of 1991 to be tougher than the first and that 1992 would be difficult. The group's industrial activi- ties - mainly care - bore the brunt of the current problems caused by slumping markets - Germany apart - and increased price competition. Operating profits on industrial activities fell to L385bn or 1.5 per cent of relevant sales. Flat did not give a year-earlier fig- ure, but said the equivalent ratio was 4.3 per cent at last year's interim stage. An 11 per cent rise in turn- over on non-industrial inter- ests, principally retailing, insurance and financial ser- vices, to L3,866bn failed to compensate for a 4.5 per cent fall in industrial activities, which slipped to L25,631bn. Overall, group sales fell 2.7 per cent to L29,497bn. Comparisons with 1990 are complicated by the inclusion of Enaea in Spain and CEAc in France. Sales for Telettra were excluded, as were those for Ford New Holland, the tractors business Fiat acquired last year, which will be consoli- dated in the second half. In the domestic car market, where Fiat sold 630,000 cars against 740,600 last year, its market share fell to 47.5 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris VALEO, the French automotive components group, yesterday reported a 47.8 per cent decline in net profits for the first half of the year and warned it did not expect an improvement in car industry demand until 1992. The group's sales fell by e per cent from FFr1O.97bn ($1.91bn) to FFrl0.3bn, on which net profits collapsed from FFr498m to FFr285m, hit by a FFr88m exceptional charge for job losses. Demand from the replacement market - a third of Valeo's sales - was stable. Valeo, has responded to the car industry's problems by sell- ing non-essential activities and curbing costs, so that the workforce stood at 28,000 at the end of June, 9 per cent down on the 30,800 payroll at the end of the first half of last year. Stocks have fallen by 3 per cent from the end of the December to the end of June, helping to reduce borrowings by FFr239m, so that net debt has fallen from 54 per cent of net assets to 46 per cent over the same period. Car industry demand was hit sharply by the Gulf war in the first quarter and continued to be depressed in the second, except in Germany. In the eight months to the end of August, sales were 5 per cent down on the same period of the previous year. 'German car demand is returning to a \"more normal level\" while activity in Europe generally and North American continues to be low. However, the launch of sev- eral new models by Valeo's car producing customers should contribute to a stronger market next year, said the group.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, yesterday announced a FFr315m ($55.2m) net loss for the first half of the year, bur- dened by heavy finance charges. The figure is not directly comparable with the FFrl5m profit the group made in the first half of 1990, because of the number of disposals Cerus has made since then to reduce the debts accumulated to finance its abortive attempt to take control of Socidtd Gdndrale de Belgique, the Belgian conglomerate, in 1988. Thanks to these divestments, Cerus has reduced its debts from FFr4.lbn at the end of last year to FFr567m by the end of June. Since the reduc- tion took place progressively during the first half, there were still heavy finance charges to pay, but Cerus's results should recover \"sub- stantially\" in the current half, said the group. Valeo, the automotive com- ponents group which is 35.9 per cent owned by Cerus, and which also published first-half results yesterday, was perform- ing satisfactorily in a difficult market, while Banque Dumdn- il-Lebld was extending its ser- vices, said the group. Cerus at the same time con- firmed the appointment of Mr Michel Cicurel, former manag- ing director of Galbani, the French-owned Italian cheese supplier, as managing director, in place of Mr Jacques Let- ertre. Mr Letertre was also at one time chairman of Dumdnil-Le- bld, whose Swiss subsidiary was a victim of a fraud involv- ing Italian shares early in the summer.",

The group's Olympla office equipment subsidiary will be closed and 6,700 Jobs lost if a buyer Is not found within four weeksu Mr Ernst Georg StOckl, chief executive, warned yesterday. Talks were continuing with two foreign companies, but he viewed the chances of a successful deal with \"muted optimism\". The subsidiary is expected to lose DMI50m on sales of DM865m this year. Despite a relatively good year for AEG as a whole - turnover is expected to rise 8 per cent to more than DM14bn - losses will be about the same as last year's DM205m, Mr Stockl added. Orders in the first six months have risen 7 per cent to DM9.6bn, thanks mainly to strong demand in the German market. Olympia, based in Wilhelmshaven, has been losing money for years, and performance has been deteriorating steadily since AEG, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz conglomerate, took overall control in 1985. Other loss-makers, automation technology and magnetic levitation railway systems, are expected to emerge from the red in the 1992 financial year, according to Mr Stockl. The drain on revenues from the car telephone business, AEG Mobile Communications, will be plugged by the sale of a 90 per cent stake to Matra of France. Meanwhile, the company is negotiating with the Treuhandanstalt, east Germany's privatisation agency, to buy the DM500m-turnover LEW rail rolling stock maker. AEG owned LEW before the communist takeover, and the two companies have worked closely together for more than 10 years.",

   "text_content" : "John Burton on the Swedish bank's drive for a cleaner balance sheet B ANKING history was being written, according to the gallows humour introduction made by Mr Hans Dalborg, the Nordbanken presi- dent, in announcing credit losses and provisions of SKr9.5bn ($1.5bn) for 1991. \"We have the largest loss a Swedish bank has ever recorded. The huge setback for state- controlled Nordbanken, which reported an operating loss of SKr4.6bn for the first eight months of this year, is a text- book example of the mounting problems confronting the Scan- dinavian banking sector. Nordic banks are now suffer- ing the consequences of sinan- cial deregulation, lax credit controls and overweening ambition. \"The balloon that was blown up during the carni- val years of the 1980s has burst,\" said Mr Dalborg, who took over at Nordbanken in January. Nordbanken's new manage- ment team was surprised by what it discovered after the government ousted the bank's former executives in December as credit losses climbed. \"What the hell is going on here?\" was how Mr Lars Thu- nell, the former head of sinan- clal services at Asea Brown-Bo- veri, described his reaction when he joined the bank in June as deputy chief executive. Nordbanken has travelled a rocky road since it was for- mally inaugurated in June 1990 out of a merger between state- controlled PKbanken and its smaller provincial rival, Nord- banken. The merger capped a rapid acquisition drive by PKbanken during the late 1980s as it attempted to boost its sluggish profitability by expanding away from its traditional cus- tomer base of small savers and lending to local governments and housing authorities. Besides buying the UK bank English Trust and the Swedish state investment bank, PKbanken paid SKr2.7bn for the Swedish brokerage firm Carnegie and SKr5.9bn for the old Nordbanken. PKbanken paid too much for Carnegie and the old Nordban- ken as part of an attempt to compete on equal terms with Sweden's other two main banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handels- banken, according to Mr Dal- bTe price for the old Nord- banken included goodwill of SKr2.lbn, now considered an overvalued figure. Nordbanken has written off the remaining goodwill of SKrl.9bn, contri- buting to its pre-tax loss of SKr6.6bn for the eight-month period. PKbanken will now be the subject of an inde- pendent commission, appointed by Mr Dalborg, to examine the policies of both PKbanken and the old Nord- banken during the late 1980s. The move is seen as an attempt by the bank's current management to distant itself from responsibility for the cri- sis. PKbanken was led in the late 1980s by Mr Christer Zetter- berg, who is now the chief executive of Volvo. The old Nordbanken was headed by Mr Rune Barneus, who become president of the new Nordban- ken last year, before losing his inh in Twamhar Hans Dalborg: criticised Nordbanken s predecessors these credits were granted between 1988 and 1990. The losses mainly consist of large loans to finance, property and investment companies, such as Nyckeln and Mobilia, that went bankrupt as the value of their property holdings fell due to the recession. The single largest amount of credit losses claimed by Nord- banken this year went to com- panies controlled by Mr Erik Penser, who had a 13.5 per cent I interest in Nordbanken after he sold Carnegie to the bank. Mr Penser's corporate empire collapsed last month after Nordbanken and S-E-Banken said he failed to fulfil loan agreements, with the banks taking over his assets. Mr Dalborg criticised Nord- banken's predecessors for tak- ing \"unreasonably large risks\" in their lending. He added that internal controls on lending were lax following financial deregulation in the mid-1980s. Borrowers could get loans from several branches, with the cen- tral office lacking oversight over the extent of the loans. The decision to make provi- sions this year for two-thirds of the non-performing loans is designed to cleanse the bank's books quickly and restore con- fidence. \"Despite the losses, which make me indignant and angry, Nordbanken is a secure bank,\" said Mr Dalborg. Operating profits before loan losses and provisions fell by only 4 per cent to SKr3.4bn, while 215 of the 230 branch offices have positive lending records following recent efforts to tighten supervision. Moreover, the new non-so- cialist government, which wants to privatise Nordban- ken, has indicated it will accept plans for the Swedish state to subscribe to a SKr5bn new share issue by the bank. This would allow Nordban- ken to meet the capital ade- quacy ratio mandated by the Bank of International Settle- ments, while guaranteeing con- tinued lending.",

The company, which last November came under the full control of the ENI energy and chemicals holding company, following the collapse of the public-private Enimont joint venture, blamed the loss on the economic downturn and the delays in implementing a sweeping programme to ration- alise its activities. In the same period last year, its predecessor Enimont made a profit of L15lbn. First-half sales rose by 2.4 per cent to L7,370bn, while operating profits plunged to L179bn from L452bn. EniChem blamed the decline on sharply falling prices for many of the plastics it produces and said it was also saddled with high labour costs. Meanwhile, EniChem's bor- rowing costs jumped by L98bn to L523bn as money was sucked into working capital and new investments, despite a L276bn drop in investment spending to L667bn owing to greater financial stringency.",

The Bonds will cease to bear interest from the Redemption Date. The Issuer and the Trustee have received differing advice on the construction of Conditions 8(B) and 8(C), as to whether the exercise of the Issuer's right to redeem at 103 per cent. overrides a holder's right to call for redemption at 117.70 per cent.

   "article_dc_title" : "President's Retirement Sparks Split at Chevron",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0927_0028_002",
   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in New York MR WILL PRICE, the outgoing president of Chevron USA, said the group's decision to split into three separate com- panies was triggered by. his decision to take early retire- ment next year. Chevron, the fourth biggest oil and gas group in the US, said this week that it would divide its US subsidiary Into separate exploration/produc- tion and reflninglmarketing companies. Warren Petroleum, a whole- sale marketer of natural gas liquids that was part of Chev- ron USA, will become a third stand-alone company. All three groups will now be sepa- rately managed and report to Mr Ken Derr, chairman of the Chevron group. Mr Price stressed in an interview that his retirement, at the age of 60, was volun- tary. The split of Chevron USA would remove one layer of management, \"and that is my job\". Chevron brought together a series of regional operations into one company - Chevron USA - in 1976. \"Over the course of the years the busi- ness has changed and it is now clear we can better serve our customers by dividing Chev- ron USA along functional lines,\" Mr Price said. Chevron, based in San Fran- cisco, does not break down turnover figures inside the group, but the US unit now being split had estimated yearly sales of $24bn last year, of total group turnover of $42.6bn. The refining and marketing side of Chevron USA recorded about $l7bn of estimated annual revenues, compared with about $7bn for the explo- ration/production side and Warren Petroleum. The marketing segment sells 1.4m barrels a day of oil, of which the Chevron USA explo- ration and production side supplies only 550,000 b/d. Chevron USA has 22,000 employees. The new explora- tion/production company will have about 8,700 employees, the marketing company 12,300 and Warren Petroleum about 1,000. Mr Price pointed out that Chevron's reorganisation was similar to those of Arco and Amoco, two of the company's biggest competitors.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Fried nan MR ROBERT Dilenschneider, the controversial president and chief executive of Hill & Knowlton, the large public relations company owned by WPP of the UK, resigned sud denly yesterday, without expla nation. Mr Bob Stone, spokesman for Hill & Knowlton, declined to say why Mr Dilenschneider had left the company. Mr Dilenschnelder, 47, who could not be reached for comr ment last night, attracted criti cism after having taken on sev- eral controversial clients. Among the group's most con iroversial roles has been its anti- abortion campaign or behalf of the Catholic Council of Bishops. Hill & Knowlton has also represented First American Bankshares, the bank whose former chairman - Mr Clark Clifford - has denied having known that First American was secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional, (BCCI). In Washington, Mr Robert Gray, the chairman of Hill & Knowlton, has been the subject of controversy. Last spring, he denied any involvement in a series of alleged meetings in Europe held in 1980 by mem- bers of the Reagan-Bush cam- paign staff who allegedly wished to provide arms to Iran in return for delaying the release of US hostages in Teh- ran."

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman THE battle for control of the Hollywood studio MGM between Mr Giancarlo Parretti, former chairman and majority shareholder, and Credit Lyon- nais, his bank backer, went bi- coastal yesterday as Mr Par- retti won a temporary restraining order in California. In Los Angeles, Pathe Com- munications, Mr Parretti's master company, was granted an order to prevent the removal of motion picture post- production equipment by MGM from a company building in Beverly Hills. However, the order was being reviewed last night. On the east coast, in Dela- ware, lawyers for Credit Lyon- nais, which is suing Mr Par- retti for allegedly breaching MGM corporate governance accords, claimed they were progressing in knocking down Mr Parretti's version of events. On Tuesday, Mr Parretti in court evidence claimed that Crddit Lyonnais had put him under pressure to sign away control of MGM last spring. Crddit Lyonnais says Mr Par- retti's mismanagement brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. One lawyer for MGM noted that translators were having difficulty understanding Mr Parretti's Italian. Two transla- tors have been dismissed and a third was at work yesterday.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dulforce in Geneva SWISS REINSURANCE (Swiss Re), the world's second largest reinsurer, yesterday disclosed a 22 per cent slide to SFr216m ($148m) in consolidated net earnings in 1990. Profits had suffered from exceptional losses due to win- ter storms, Mr Walter Diehl, chairman, told shareholders. The parent company in Zur- ich made a net profit of SFrl41.2m, which is 19.7 per cent down on 1989. The board proposes to pay an unchanged dividend of SFr45 a share and SFr9 per non-voting share, making a total payout of SFr97.9m. At the group level, Swiss Re recorded an underwriting loss of SFr717m on its non-life busi- ness, against a loss in 1989 of SFr414m. By contrast, in life insurance the group increased its underwriting earnings from SFr77m to SFr93m. Financial income from investments rose by SFr33m to SFrl.71lbn, while other income and outgoings gave a positive balance of SFr6lm. Manage- ment expenses had remained stable while taxes were signifl- cantly lower, Swiss Re said. Group gross premiums rose by 10.8 per cent in original cur- rencies last year but, when converted into Swiss francs, the increase in volume declined by 1.2 per cent, to give a total of SFrl4.9bn. Net premi- ums amounted to SFrl3.9bn, which was also 1.2 per cent higher than in 1989. Gross premium income at the parent company increased by 0.9 per cent to SFr4.78bn, but this concealed an increase of 11.4 per cent in original cur- rencies. The parent's non-life under- writing loss increased to SFr478m from SFr226m, while its profit on the life business, at SFr4lm, was SFr1m higher. * Zurich Insurance, the big- gest Swiss insurance group, yesterday reported a 17 per cent improvement to SFrlO.6bn in gross premiums written dur- ing the first half of the year. Provided the remaining months do not expose the group to extraordinary losses or exceptional fluctuations in investments or exchange rates, Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, expects a further improvement in full-year earnings. In 1990 the group posted net profits of SFr387m. Part of the first-half growth in premiums was attributed to currency fluctuations, the dol- lar in particular having strengthened against the Swiss franc. Nevertheless, premium growth in local currencies had been \"a pleasing 9 per cent\", Mr Gerber said.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman FLEET/NORSTAR, the Providence, Rhode Island- based bank that earlier this year acquired the failed Bank of New England (BNE), said yesterday it expected acquisi- tion-related charges to cause third-quarter earnings per share to drop to as little as 1 cent, compared with 27 cents in the same period last year. Mr John Flynn, chief sinan- cial officer of Fleet/Norstar, said BNE-related charges would result in third-quarter earnings of between $5m and $10m, or between 1 and 5 cents a share. This compares with third-quarter 1990 earnings of $31m, or 27 cents. Mr Flynn said that on an operating basis Fleet would earn up to $60m in the second half of 1991, before taking charges against the BNE acqui- sition. The bank's holding com- pany should return to profit- ability in the final quarter. Fleet, the largest bank in New England thanks to the BNE deal, plans to close 59 of BNE's 314 branches and reduce its workforce by about 3,000 to 12,000. In Chicago, Continental Bank has agreed to sell most of its information technology operations to IBM. Continental expects to save more than $100m, or 20 per cent of its information technology costs, during the ten-year deal.",

Although no announcement has yet been made, both groups have issued cautionary announcements in the past few days. It has been public know- ledge for at least a year that Checkers was for sale as its parent, Tradegro, was in the process of divesting assets. Pepkor considered acquiring Checkers last year, but agree- ment could not be reached on price. Matters were also com- plicated by a shareholder who sought to prevent the unbundl- ing of Tradegro. Earlier this week, Tradegro's scheme of arrangement received judicial sanction from the Rand Supreme Court. According to industry sources, the deal would involve Sankorp, the industrial arm of the Sanlam insurance group, selling its stake in Tradegro to Pepkor, which would thereby obtain control of the Checkers chain. Pepkor's most important interests are the Pep Stores chain - which has about 700 outlets selling mostly clothing, footwear and household goods - and the Shoprite chain of 72 supermarkets. Shoprite is expected to take over the Checkers stores. Pepkor is believed to be plan- ning a store rationalisation programme which could affect as many as 100 of its 168 stores. Many of the stores are encum- bered with expensive leases which need to be renegotiated. Pepkor is believed to have offered some of the stores to Checkers' main competitors such as OK Bazaars and Pick 'n Pay.",

South Deep Exploration Company raised R289m when it was listed in November 1990. When the project was unveiled last year, JCI was planning to spend R2.2bn to bring the mine to production. Mr Maxwell described it then as \"probably the largest and most important known gold ore body remaining to be exploited\". Mr Maxwell said with the gold price at current levels it was not propitious to go to the market to raise money for the project as originally envisaged. The savings will be made by pursuing a more modest shaft development plan, which will not restrict the mine's ability to revert to its original plan should the market improve. Mr Maxwell said it was JCI's view that the market for gold would turn around in the next few years.",

The company reported prof- its after tax of HK$724.5m (US$93.6m) compared with HK1627.4m a year ago. Turn- over dipped to HK$982m from HK$1.07bn last time. Mr James Wu, chairman, said core divisions had per- formed satisfactorily despite a general economic slowdown. The company paid a special interim dividend in May before a HK$5.7bn rights issue. There was no final divi- dend. Total dividends for the year Increased 8.3 per cent to 26 cents a share. Hopewell completed a hotel project and two other develop- ments during the year, boost- ing its investment portfolio to 197,000 sq m. Profits from the company's property holdings are set to rise sharply in 1991 and 1992, helped by new ten- ancies and rental reversions. Mr Gordon Wu, managing director, issued a warning on Hong Kong's rising property prices. He said that increases this year, sometimes of more than 40 per cent, were infla- tionary and would squeeze first-time buyers out of the market. Work is continuing on Hope- well's Guangzhou superhigh- way, a dual three-lane road linking Hong Kong's border with the capital of China's Guangdong province. * Sino Land, one of Hong Kong's most aggressive prop- erty developers, announced a 43.5 per cent increase in net profits to HK$553.86m for the year to end-June.

   "text_content" : "By Terry HaH In Wellington BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group, yesterday reported a 47.3 per cent drop in profit after tax to NZ$21.7m (US$121.7m) in the year to June, compared with a net profit of NZ$401.7m in the pre- vious year. Results were depressed by flat performances in New Zea- land and Britain, where the group has 57 per cent of its assets following last year's takeover of Mount Charlotte, the UK hotel group. A big improvement is expected in New Zealand due to manage- ment changes there. Mr Bruce Hancox, chairman, said the past year had been the harshest the company ever faced. \"But I've no doubt we'll do better this year,\" he added. Mr Hancox said directors were comfortable with the results of the first quarter. These had been helped by a sharp reduction in. interest costs in the UK and New Zea- land. Monthly group interest costs fell from NZ$88m in Jan- uary to NZ$22m currently. Mr Paul Collins, chief execu- tive, announced a c'dut in annual dividend payout from 11 cents to 9 cents. He said that the corporate policy was to maintain or increase that divi- dend level and to aim for the company to be a NZ$2 stock in four years. He said the company was involved in a number of\"inter- esting\" and \"very surprising\" plays. These could involve buy- ing, selling and swapping assets, but the size of invest- ments would be governed by divestments, he said. Tozer Kemsley and Mill- bourn, the UK-based motor division, enjoyed a favourable year, helped by strong demand for its automotive franchises, including Suburu and Mazda dealerships. The Mount Charlotte hotel group in the UK had performed as well as its competitors had in the recession, the group said, and only its heavy debt burden had prevented the divi- sion from making a substantial contribution to profits. * Carter Holt Harvey (CHH), New Zealand's largest forestry group which is 31 per cent con- trolled by BIL, said yesterday it had filed a prospectus for the flotation of Simsmetal, the Australian scrap metal com- pany, with the Australian Securities Commission, Reuter reports from Auckland.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, yes- terday downgraded its profits forecast for the current year, citing \"very difficult market conditions in all the company's businesses\". Earlier this year, CSR fore- cast a fall in net profits to around A$275m (US$219.3m) from the A$326m achieved in 1990-91. However, the group said it felt obliged to revise the forecast to \"somewhere in the vicinity of A$200m\". CSR said that results for the first half were expected to fol- low the normal pattern of being a little higher than the second half, due to the cyclical nature of some of the group's businesses. The group also said it was improving productivity and expected to reap \"significant rewards\" from economic recov- ery in Australia and the US, its two main markets. In the short-term, however, sugar profits are expected to fall by 60 per cent from last year's level of A$86m as a result of floods and drought during the growing season. Production is expected to fall by 17 per cent to 7m tonnes. The mill most affected would process less than half its rated capacity of cane and operate for only about 13 weeks, the group said. Profits have also been hit by low sugar prices. CSR said aluminium prices were at their lowest level since January 1987, and are expected to average around 20 per cent less than last year. The divi- sion made A$34m last year, but is expected to achieve \"little better than break-even\". The Australian building and construction business is not expected to match last year's profits of A$145m, but the group gave no indication of the likely extent of the decline. It said there was some confidence that the steep decline in activ- ity had ceased, but signs of positive and substantial recov- ery had yet to emerge. The US building materials division was benefiting from modest signs of recovery from depressed conditions, particu- larly in Florida, but results were expected to be \"signifi- cantly down\" on last year's A$35m."

CS Holding's consolidated results for the first half of 1991 show a positive trend in earnings, which were largely unaffected by the generally lethargic pace of economic activity. All Group companies contributed to this success: Credit Suisse Leu Holding Ltd. CS First Boston, Inc. Electrowatt Ltd. Sides Holding CS Life Group companies active in banking report a marked improvement in profits, compared not only with last year but also with the impressive results of 1989. CS First Boston has recovered from the difficulties it encountered in 1990 and records a much higher-than- expected net profit for the first half of this year. The improved conditions on the US capital market enabled bridge loans to be scaled down considerably. Thus, since the end of 1990, CS Holding has been able to reduce its total exposure from $ 470 millions to $ 135 millions. NET PROFIT TOTAL ASSETS RETURN ON UP 77% UP 16% EQUITY (ROE) The Credit Suisse Group, the Leu Group, the CS First Boston Group and all companies in which CS Holding has either a direct or indirect interest in excess of 50% are included on a fully consolidated basis while the Sides Group, CS Life and the Electrowatt Group are in- cluded on the basis of the equity method.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb in London and Patrick Harverson In New York SPECULATION that the Bank of Japan is about to cut its *official discount rate pushed Japanese government bonds to their highest levels since Janu- ary 1990. Traders said the Bank of Japan could announce a rate cut as early as today if the consumer prices indices due out this morning show a fall in inflation. The government is due to announce nationwide price figures for August and Tokyo figures for September. The discount rate was cut from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent on July 1. The benchmark No 129 bond rose strongly to yield 5.945 per cent before closing at 5.96 per cent, helped by a fall in overnight unsecured call money rates to 6M1 per cent yes- terday. The No 129 bond opened yes- terday with a yield of 6.01 per cent before falling sharply on speculative and hedge-selling. However, the market saw strong technical support when the December futures contract reached 99.26 and the No 129 bond yielded 6.04 per cent - bond prices recovered to reach the highs of the day. Traders noted strong buying in the two to five-year sector of the bond market. * HEAVY buying of short- dated government securities lifted US bond markets yester- day after some unexpectedly bearish new economic data had raised hopes for another inter- est rate cut. In late trading, the bench- mark 30-year government bond was up a at 102%, yielding 7.878 per cent. The two-year note was up A at 100%, to carry a yield of 6.041 per cent. The market had opened firmer across the board on news of a larger-than-expected rise in weekly initial jobless claims and an unexpected revi- sion of the second-quarter gross national product figure, which was changed from a decline of 0.1 per cent to a decline of 0.5 per cent. Both sets of data suggested the economy is in a weaker GOVERNMENT BONDS state than originally thought. Prices at the long end briefly retreated in the face of profit- taking, but recovered alongside strong buying of two-year notes prompted by raised hopes of a cut in short-term interest rates. * UK government bonds ended mixed yesterday, with short- dated gilt prices barely changed on the day while long- dated gilts fell on profit-taking. The return on the gilt mar- ket is estimated to be 9 to 10 per cent for the third quarter, but traders expect to see some consolidation now. \"For the moment, the gilt market is at the mercy of the opinion polls and sterling's performance in the foreign exchange markets,\" one trader said . The Liffe gilt futures con- tract fell to 95.27 from its open- ing of 96.04 while the benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell to 114A from 114%. STHE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) yesterday announced that trading in the Italian gov- ernment bond (BTP) futures contract will be possible on the exchange's automated pit trad- ing system in the early evening trading session, with effect from Monday. The futures contract was launched on September 19 and since launch has had an aver- age daily volume of 10,295 con- tracts. It is currently traded during the daytime on the exchange's trading floor. SGERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day although traders noted further strong interest in the new four- year Treasury notes. As expected, the Bundes- bank left credit policies unchanged after its regular council meeting yesterday. The discount rate was left at 7.5 per cent and the Lombard emer- gency financing rate at 9.25 per cent. News that September figures for the preliminary cost of liv- ing for western Germany showed a month-on-month increase of 0.2 per cent and a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent had little impact on the bund market. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 85.30 and edged up to 85.33 by late after- noon. Elsewhere, dealers said spec- ulation that the Dutch govern- ment would announce a new bond issue shortly helped to push state Dutch bond prices slightly lower yesterday. It is widely expected that the government may re-open its 8.75 per cent bond due 2001 for tap sales."

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters A NEW method for calculating the expiry price of futures and options contracts based on the FT-SE index will be introduced on Monday in an attempt to reinforce investor confidence in London's leading equity derivative instruments. But the change will not set- tle the grumble that has ech- oed around the market for more than a year. Critics argue that London's method of han- dling the expiry is archaic and drives would-be investors away. The futures contract - and, ultimately, the underlying cash market - will suffer as a result, they claim. In the past, the price of the FT-SE derivative contracts at expiry was calculated by tak- ing the value of the index over a 10-minute period mid-way through the morning trading session. This had its draw- backs: the timing often coin- cided with the announcement of government statistics, adding to market volatility, for instance. More damaging has been the potential for abuse. In Lon- don's quote-driven market, the index is based on prices quoted by market-makers rather than prices at which deals are actu- ally done. By quoting artificial prices during the expiry period, individual market-mak- ers could influence the expiry price in their favour. The arguments erupted pub- licly in June 1990, when Gold- man Sachs and Barclays de Zoete Wedd drove prices aggressively in opposite direc- tions during the expiry period, causing extreme share price volatility. Both firms were cleared of manipulation, but reform became essential. On Monday, two of those changes take effect: the expiry period will begin earlier, at 10.10am, and will extend over a 20-minute period, to make manipulation harder. From next June, the expiry day will also switch from the final busi- ness day of each quarter to the third Friday in the month. More radical change is needed, according to some in the market. Goldman itself is among the most vociferous critics, claiming London should switch from a quote- driven to an auction-driven market at expiry time to reduce volatility, bringing it into line with most other lead- ing markets. Buy and sell orders should be pooled centrally and any imbalances ironed out to reach the expiry price, it says. The process could be handled before the market opens, allow- ing London's normal Seaq mar- ket to operate uninterrupted during normal market hours. At present, London has a \"deeply flawed expiry process which is inhibiting the growth of the contract,\" says Mr David Silfen, co-head of Goldman's equities division. Few disagree that the FT-SE futures contract has been a mild disappointment. In spite of steady year-on-year growth, its progress pales beside the rapid growth of more recently introduced equity index futures in other markets.",

Figures released yester- day by the New York Stock Exchange showed net profits of its 322 member-firms rose 84 per cent to $859m in the second quarter of this year. In the first quarter, NYSE members earned $957m from trading, interest and commission income. Strong demand for domestic equities, relatively heavy trad- ing volume, a rise in new stock issues and buoyant share prices were behind the increased earnings, and helped boost member-firms' assets (including cash, receivables, securities and property) by 13.4 per cent in the quarter to a record $597.2bn.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters IF ANY doubts remained about how long it would take to develop a common interna- tional standard for the capital backing of securities compa- nies, they should have been dispelled by developments this week in Washington. At their latest annual meet- ing under the auspices of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (losco), regulators from around the world reached tentative agree- ment on the first step towards a common standard. It took three years of intricate discus- sion to get this far: yet the results, even now, are so tenta- tive as to offer little more than a rough indication of what may lie ahead. The agreement amounts only to an attempt at partial conver- gence on how capital adequacy is assessed. losco has tackled the market risks run by securi- ties companies, and what should be recognised as capital for regulatory purposes: it has not grappled with the overall risks they face. Some of the technical committee's mem- bers have argued that this par- tial approach could tilt the \"level playing field\" for which the regulators have been striv- ing. Against this background, the technical committee at least managed to reach three impor- tant conclusions this week - though none have the support of all its members. They are: * Equity position risk - the most contentious of the sub- jects under discussion - should be covered by capital equivalent to 8 per cent of gross equity positions, and 4 per cent of net positions. 'Though the US supports the move, France, the UK and Japan argue that the rule is too strict and would require securities companies to take on excessive capital The rule as drafted does not take adequate account of the \"different experiences of politi- cal risk, volatility and liquidity and the wide variety of individ ual market structures and other unique local features,\" they argue. * Market risk should be assessed according to the so-called \"building-block approach\", rather than the \"comprehensive approach\" commonly used by securities regulators. This method, pre- ferred by bank regulators, involvep breaking a position risk into two elements - gen- eral market risk, and specific risk related to the company whose securities are held. Japan, which recently intro- duced its own comprehensive system, has agreed to the switch - but only if all other technical committee members go along with the change. However, the US has said that the building block approach \"could result in substantially lower capital requirements for equities\" than required under Securities and Exchange Com- mission rules, and that, although it would support the method for other countries, it would not adopt it itself. * Up to 70 per cent of a securi- ties company's capital could take the form of subordinated loans. This represents a victory for those countries which had argued that such debt should comprise a large part of quali- fying capital, provided it was adequately \"locked in\" and could not be repaid in certain circumstances. Two members of the committee argue that the 70 per cent ceiling is too low, two that it is too high.",

   "article_dc_title" : "High Demand for Allied-Lyons' Â£150m Deal",
   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan A HANDFUL of new Eurobond issues met generally firm demand in a market that remains bullish. In the sterling sector, Allied-Lyons, the UK food and INTERNATIONAL BONDS drinks company, chose Baring Brothers to launch a successful Â£150m offering of bonds due 1999. The deal met strong demand - from UK institutions in partic- ular - reflecting the compa- ny's strong UK manufacturing name, and a reasonable yield spread of 81 basis points above the comparable gilt issue. Recent speculation that Allied-Lyons may be a take- over target failed to dent enthusiasm for the deal. Event- risk protection written into the deal forces the borrower to redeem the issue at par if Allied-Lyons, currently with- out a long-term debt rating, is taken over. If the debt is rated, the event-risk protection will be triggered should the debt be downgraded below investment grade as a result of a restruct- uring.) The funds, which are not swapped, will refinance exist- ing bank debt, allowing the company to extend the matu- rity profile of its debt, while locking in a relatively low interest rate. In the Ecu market, Export- Import Bank of Japan followed up Wednesday's sell-out deal for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop- ment with an Ecu250m five- year deal via Paribas Capital Markets. The deal met strong demand from the Far East as investors who had failed to get their hands on EBRD paper used up the money they had put aside. The deal was swapped into floating-rate dollars, taking advantage of relatively attrac- tive swap opportunities in the sector. However, the fresh supply of paper in the next week or so is likely to be limited as Spain has postponed its expected Eculbn bond offering. Strong demand is fuelling new issue activity in the Cana- dian dollar sector, although the lack of attractive swap oppor- tunities continues to act as a brake. Deutsche Bank Finance launched a C$250m five-year deal, priced to yield just 22 basis points above the compa- rable Canadian government bond. Even taking into account the tightening of Canadian Euro- bond spreads in recent months, the deal was considered aggres- sively priced. \"Deutsche Bank pushed rather hard on the pric- ing, but demand is so firm that the deal worked anyway,\" one dealer said. The deal met strong demand in Germany, where retail investors, for whom spreads are less relevant, find the rela- tively high yields attractive, and the Deutsche Bank name, one of few remaining banks rated Triple-A, always sells well. The deal was bid at 99.75, three basis points above its fixed reoffered price.",

   "text_content" : "By 8Slmo London A DISPUTE between con- vertible bondholders and Bell Resources Financial Services (BRFS), once part of the empire of Mr Alan Bond, the Australian entreprneUr, will be settled in the High Court in London next month. The dispute centres on the right of the company to call its outstanding $200m 5% per cent convertible bond issue before bondholders have the chance to exercise a put option. The company plans to call the bonds at 108 per cent of face value on November 18. However, the trustee of the bond issue, Law & Debenture Trust Corporation, argued that the bondholders' right to put the bonds at 117.7 per cent of face value should take priority over the company's call. The potential cost to the issuer depends on how much of the bond issue is outstand- ing. If none of the bonds have been converted into equity, a decision in favour of the bond- holders by the High Court on October 7 could cost the com- pany an additional $29.4m. The BRFS case is believed to be the first of its kind involv- ing a convertible bond issue which also includes an inves- tor put option. The disputed issue, launched in 1986, was one of the first to use the structure. The put option at a premium to face value is designed to ensure investors a high yield on the bonds even if the con- version rights become worth- less - if the issuers share price collapses, for example. This form of financing later became popular with British corporations.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron in New York THE US Treasury promised Congress yesterday that it would conclude its investiga- tions into illegal manipulations of the government securities market by early December. The investigations were launched after Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street secu- rities house, admitted rigging government bond and note auctions. Mr Jerome Powell, assistant Treasury secretary, told a House of Representatives sub- committee hearing into the Salomon affair that the Trea- sury and other government agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Federal Reserve, would submit recommenda- tions for legislative changes to improve market regulation as soon as their investigations were completed. Mr Powell did not say what changes might be recom- mended, but Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the New York Fed, indicated the authorities were considering using a \"Dutch auction\" method of selling Treasury notes and bonds, where securities are awarded to all bidders at a sin- gle price. Under the current system, they are handed out at a range of prices according to how high dealers and custom ers have bid. On Wednesday, the Treasury was given breath ung space to finish its investi gation into the Salomon scan dal when the Senate passed a bill extending for one year the 1986 Government Securities Act, which grants the Treasury authority to regulate the gov- ernment securities market. At yesterday's hearing, Salo mon officials said that two new violations of Treasury bidding rules by its traders had been found and that more irregulari ties might yet be discovered. However, Mr Deryck MIaughan, Salomon's chief operating officer, told the sub- committee that the firm had been asked by investigating authorities not to disclose details of the violations until their probe of Salomon was completed. Mr Maughan also revealed to the hearing that Salomon had made \"millions\" of dollars after it garnered con- trol of almost all of a May two year note issue. At the time, Salomon used its position to force other deal- ers to pay above-normal prices for the newly-issued securities. Mr Maughan's admission that Salomon profited hugely from the May auction will strengthen the case of those securities dealers and investors who have filed lawsuits claim- ing damages for losses incurred because of Salomon's fraudulent activities. The possibility that Salomon could lose its primary dealer- ship was raised at the hearing when Mr Michael Basham, for- mer deputy assistant Treasury secretary, told the sub-commit- tee that stripping a securities house of its status as a primary dealer could be an appropriate punishment for serious viola- tions of Treasury rules. Mr Maughan, however, said Salomon's financial viability would be threatened if it lost its primary dealer status. Salomon is temporarily barred from submitting bids for customers in Treasury auc- tions, and its primary dealer- ship is under review. However, the Treasury and the Fed have welcomed the changes intro- duced at Salomon since the scandal broke, and have applauded the integrity of the new management at the firm, led by billionaire investor Mr Warren Buffett, the chairman.",

   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan THE BASLE Supervisors Com- mittee may be closer to accept- ing a change in the calculation of banks' swap exposure, which would reduce the amount of capital banks have to hold against swap transac- tions. Without such a change, the Basle accord, which comes into force in January 1993, could place the future of the $3,000bn global swaps market in jeop- ardy, according to Mr Mark Brickell, chairman of the Inter- national Swap Dealers Associa- tion, speaking at the associa- tion's regional conference in London yesterday. But, after four years of lob- bying, the ISDA is optimistic that the Basle Supervisors' Committee will recognise the concept of \"netting\" - offset- ting opposite swap exposure - in their capital adequacy guidelines. Swaps, which \"may be the most successful financial prod- uct introduced in the 1980s\", according to Mr Brickell, could come under severe threat if the Basle capital rules take force in January 1993 in their cur- rent form. The rules would force banks to hold an 8 per cent ratio of capital to risk-based assets. The amount of capital required for swap agreements would be calculated according to the total notional exposure of each swap agreement. ISDA is lobbying for the acceptance of the concept of netting, or offsetting opposite swap transactions. This would allow banks to calculate net exposure and put aside capital accordingly. Netting \"can substantially reduce the risk of a swap port- folio,\" Mr Brickell said. With- out it, banks would probably turn to alternative financial products. The concept of net- ting is now legally enforceable in most markets, Mr Brickell added. Should there be no change from Basle, it is not only the swaps market which could be hit, but also the $560bn market in other off-balance sheet financial products such as over-the-counter options, for- ward-rate agreements, and caps and floors, all of which can also be netted. The Supervisors' Committee has agreed to give further con- sideration to the issue, and Mr Brickell believes this \"should lead to a decision to permit netting\". However, there are complex issues surrounding the means of calculating exposure, which has to be \"marked to market\" - that is adjusted according to market movements.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Alcoa 'Will Not Cut Aluminium Output'",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0927_0032_001",
   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent, in Davenport, Iowa 'THE ALUMINIUM Company of America (Alcoa), the biggest aluminium producer outside the former Soviet Union, had no plans to shut down any of its North American production capacity despite prices having been down to their lowest ever levels in real terms, said Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman, yester- day. However, he suggested that the aluminium industry would do well to take a \"holiday\" from introducing new primary aluminium capacity after the next round of smelter openings over the next year or so. This would enable demand and supply to become better balanced. On the question of immedi ate cuts, Mr O'Neill said of Alcoa: \"We're doing OK. We're not doing nearly as well as I would like but when I look at what other people are doing I'm influenced by the fact that we're still making some money while some other people are not. It seems to me that the burden of taking some down- time ought to fall on those who are not making any money, not those who are\". His comments echo those of Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan Aluminium of Canada, second largest of the non-Sc viet producers, who said recently that as his company r; William 0. Bourke, chairman of Reynolds Metals lampany, expects . Iri lng ahimIn pri- - to cause- other a mUprdnucrs tofoao his lead m cprtailng oipi, reports Reuters from New York. After Reynrods announced plans to close the rest of its Tr6utdale, Orn production, Mr Bourke said he thought the price of aluminium \"will go down till we see more curtailment\"\". There would not necessarily be any big cuts, Mr Bourke said, Just a little here, a little therp\". He said there were a whole series of subtle things that can be done that would have no effect on the market but quite a cumulative effect (on production).\" The present London Metal Exchange aluminium price of about 55 cents a lb Is still above what Mr Bourke called the average \"cash\", or out of pocket, cost of producing alumin- lum, which he estimated in the mid-40 cents a Ib range. But he put \"fully accounted cost of production worldwide\" in the M-id6 cents a lb range, so most producers were operating unprofitably. was one of the world's lowest cost producers it would be illogical for it to shut down capacity when high cost capac- ity elsewhere continued to operate. Even in the present extremely depressed market conditions Alcan was better off continuing to produce at close to capacity than having some shut down. Producers resist pressure to cut output because it is not economically viable to make only slight adjustments to alu- minium production in view of the technical problems this causes. Also, restarting alu- minium pot lines is very expensive and takes a rela- tively long time. The industry faces a big step up in capacity next year when two new smelters in Quebec, Canada, and Pechiney's new smelter in Dunkirk, France, come into operation. Analysts calculate that by 1993 another Im tonnes of capacity will be operating compared with today's estimated 14.5m tonnes outside the former eastern bloc. Mr O'Neill said the industry, like many others, had not been very good at getting a funda- mental balance between supply and demand. He was not wor- capacity coming into the mar- ket next year even though It might not be fily absorbed. \"But it would be OK with me if new capacity was not started in any significant amount for the next couple of years (after 1992) because I think that would get us into that rough balance that's desirable.\" Mr O'Neill, who was speak- ing during presentations at Alcoa's Davenport aluminium mill, where a $250m modernisa- tion programme has Just been completed, said Alcoa had no plans to add capacity at exist- ing plants for the time being. The group recently won from the Venezuelan government the right to be the predomi- nant partner in a new $1.2bn smelter to be built in that country, which produces the lowest cost aluminium in the world because of its abundance of hydro-electric power. However, Mr O'Neill insisted that this scheme would not proceed very quickly. Alcoa would go ahead \"when it is clear that the world is going to be in rough balance and one can anticipate metal prices better than 80 cents or 85 cents a lb for a period of 3 or 4 years after the completion of the smelter.\" Otherwise it would not be a profitable investment.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0927_0032_002",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney AUSTRALIA'S RURAL sector is facing its worst financial cri- sis for a century, Mr Graham Blight, president of the National Farmers Federation, said yesterday. Mr Blight's warning follows increasing rural anger about the impact of competition from subsidised US and European agricultural exports on farmers hit by falling prices and col- lapsing markets. He said the farm sector had fallen from recession into the grip of a major depression since the end of the last financial year in June. \"I suspect this year will be the worst year in agriculture possibly for a hundred years,\" Mr Blight said. The industry would probably recover next year, but \"the good times\" would not return until the mid- dle of the decade, he said. Mr Blight called for talks with the federal government over the Rural Adjustment Scheme, under which farmers receive grants to help cover the cost of ending unprofitable production. However, he said some farm- ers were so hopelessly in debt that their businesses would be unable to recover even if there was a rapid turnround in the prospects for the industry. \"We have got a certain per- centage at the bottom - it could be between 7 and 15 per cent in some areas - where they simply have to go [off the land],\" he said. Mr Blight's comments follow forecasts by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics that aver- age prices received by farmers would fall by five per cent this year, following a decline of 13 per cent last year. Abare said net farm cash incomes would fall by 24 per cent, following a 35 per cent fall in the last financial year. The net value of farm produc- tion, after depreciation costs, is forecast to fall by 74 per cent, following a drop of similar magnitude last year. The rural sector has been hit by weak prices for a range of commodities including sugar, dairy products and beef. How- ever, the biggest problems have been caused by competi- tion from subsidised wheat exports and the collapse of the wool market because of over- production and falling demand.",

   "article_dc_title" : "India Bans Export of Cotton Yarn",
   "text_content" : "By Kunal Bose in Calcutta THE INDIAN government has banned the export of cotton yarn until December in an attempt to reduce yarn prices in the domestic market. The decision was triggered by the sharp increase in cotton yarn prices since July, which has made the working of han- dloom and powerloom units uneconomic. For a government struggling with the country's worst ever balance of payments crisis it was a very difficult decision. But the reports of starvation deaths among handloom weav- ers in Andhra Pradesh, from where Mr Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister hails, are unnerving for the minority government in New Delhi. That explains why domestic supplies were given precedence over exports. According to industry offi- cials, the rise in yarn prices has to be seen in the context of the runaway inflation in raw cotton prices. Prices of various grades of cotton have increased by 75 to 110 per cent since October 1990. However, it was only in July, when the spin- ning units were running short of cotton, that the yarn prices started edging upward. In the past three months, yarn prices have increased by nearly 40 per cent. As they did earlier with raw cotton, traders have mopped up large quanti- ties of yarn, there is no short- age of yarn as such, but the weavers are required to pay a high premium. Against the export quota of 100m kg of yarn for 1991, the country in the first eight months (January-August) had shipped 79.60m kg worth Rs5.24bn (Â£120m). Yarn consti- tutes about 25 per cent of India's total textile exports.",

Dealers said the market's recent technical bounce was unable to hold three-month metal above the key $7,600-a-tonne level. Prices are likely to continue lower now, with falls below $7,470, the recent 18-month low, a real possibility. Comled from Reuters SUGAR - Leiem POX .

   "text_content" : "Deborah Hargreaves assesses this week's agreement HIS WEEK'S agreement among ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce 23.65m barrels of oil a day for the next three months is a paper compromise allowing most countries to pro- duce oil flat-out. The agreement was reached after many hours of heated debate about individual minis ters' price aspirations and, true to form, the organisation ducked the main issue of assigning specific production quotas to each country. \"I'm afraid we didn't divide the fig- ure between the 13 countries so it probably means everyone could produce what they want,\" said Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister. But Mr AMazadeh said he is still satisfied with the ceiling because it should prove lower than predicted demand in the fourth quarter - meaning prices will be flrmer. The 23.65m b/d ceiling is, in any case, close to full capacity of the 11 countries that are in full production. Additional out- put from Iraq and Kuwait could be absorbed by the extra demand ministers expect to see. But by reaching a compro- mise that takes no view of his- torical production quotas, Opec is putting off arguments about sharing out the cake until later this year or early next. The crunch will come next spring when demand will take a sea- sonal dive and Iraq and Kuwait should be closer to full produc- tion. Evidence of cracks in the fragile alliance between Iran and Saudi Arabia that has effectively steered Opec policy for the last nine months, will lead to tough negotiations over production quotas. Iran has openly criticised Saudi Arabia's emphatic state- ment to reporters that it wants to keep output at 8.5m b/d, 3m bid above the kingdom's old production quota. Most minis- ters at the meeting agreed that demand in the final quarter of the year would approach 24m b/d because of a seasonal pick-up in usage as well as the expected world economic recovery. But some pushed for lower output levels in order to give prices a boost - these ministers from smaller produc- ing countries such as Libya and Algeria wanted a simple roll-over of the existing 22.3m b/d production ceiling. This faction within the fragile coali- tion came into conflict with Saudi Arabia, which aims to keep prices stable and expects demand for Opec oil to touch 24.5m b/d in the fourth quarter. For this reason, it was pushing for a rise in the ceiling to 24m b/d. The 23.65m b/d ceiling was arrived at by a complicated cal- culation and just happens to be the same as the organisation's current output. Most countries have ignored the 22.3m b/d ceiling which was set in March and reaf- firmed at June's meeting, and are currently producing at capacity with total output for September about 23.6m b/d. Added to this output rate are the expected exports from Iraq and Kuwait by the end of the year. Kuwait is at present producing some 230,000 b/d and expects to add at least another 200,000 b/d by December. At the same time, Iraq says it is now producing 460,000 b/d, the bulk of which is for internal consumption and 60,000 for export to Jordan as part of a non-commercial arrangement. Iraq looks set to agree to the terms of the United Nations' resolution that would enable it to export $1.6bn-worth of oil over the next six months. The Iraqi minister told the meeting that, rather than send this oil at a rate of 500,000 b/d for the six-month period, he would prefer to export as much as possible - up to 1m b/d - and sell the oil within three months. While ministers remain scep- tical of Iraq's export capability, they have built their calcula- tions around these figures. \"Depending on how optimistic or pessimistic you are about Iraq's production, this will translate into a production level of 24.2m to 25m b/d in the fourth quarter,\" said Mr Nor- dine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's energy minister. He added. that, given the uncertainties in the market for the final quar- ter, production at that level was unlikely to have a major effect on prices. pec cited market uncer- tainties such as the decline in output from the former Soviet Union and a small drop in non-Opec produc- tion as well as rising demand which leaves a fragile supply balance. The organisation reiterated its commitment to reaching the $21-a-barrel reference price by the end of the year. But it called on the Opec secretariat to monitor prices closely and call another meeting if the price goes out of line. This means that if prices are more than $1 a barrel lower or sev- eral dollars higher than the ref- erence price over a month, another meeting could be called to discuss the situation. The main point of contention at the meeting, however, emerged in the debate over next year's production - par- ticularly in the second and third quarters. Most ministers are pushing for an agreement to return to a deal put in place in July 1990 that set out firm production quotas, but was Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh is satisfied with the output ceiling abandoned at the outbreak of the Gulf war. Saudi Arabia has not agreed specifically to trim production and is believed to favour the introduction of quotas based more closely on output capac- ity, which would give it a far larger share than the 5.4m b/d quota included in the July deal. In anticipation of a possible shift, others are manoeuvring to raise their production num- bers. Iran, for example, says it is currently producing 3.55m b/d, which is higher than inde- pendent estimates. Mr Aqaza- deh said Iran should be produc- ing 3.7m b/d by November and 4m by next year. Even Nigeria says it will increase output from 1.85m b/d to 1.95m b/d. At the same time, Kuwait will ask the organisation for a higher production quota once its oil industry is up and running again. Mr Homoud al-Rqobah, the emirate's oil minister said: \"In fairness we should be allowed to produce more, at least for a period, because we've gone from producing nothing. . . those that have increased will have to cut back.\" Without any agreement on quotas, prices could slide next year when demand turns down. \"We're really looking at a serious situation next spring if we don't resolve the problem soon enough and soon enough doesn't mean when prices start crashing,\" said Mr Ait Laous- sine.",

   "text_content" : "By David Blackwell WORLD COFFEE prices fell yesterday as the International Coffee Organisation talks appeared to be heading to an inconclusive close and rain was forecast for Brazil's coffee growing areas. London's November robusta contract closed down Â£12 at Â£522 a tonne, only Â£2 above the year's low. New York's Decem- ber arabica contract fell 3.80 cents a lb at the opening, but in late trading had recovered to trade at 89.10 cents a lb, down 2.20 cents. At the beginning of this week's talks the markets felt that a proposal from Brazil and Colombia for a scheme to retain 10 per cent of their exports might have gained fur- ther momentum. Between them, Brazil and Colombia have 40 per cent of the market. However, it does not appear that the retention proposal has made any progress. When the talks end today, delegates believe there could be a recommendation for a one-year extension of the cur- rent agreement, which ends in September next year, and the establishment of a working party to look at the prospects of a further agreement. Reports that some showers had fallen in the coffee grow- ing areas of Brazil after some weeks of drought were seen by traders yesterday as more important than the ICO's lack of progress.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels THE EC/US farm trade row over American corn gluten, the animal feed substitute, was finally settled yesterday. US imports of corn gluten, which under a 1962 agreement within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade enter the EC tariff-free, had been piling up in Rotterdam, after objec- tions that they contained more corn-meal than allowed under the accord. The two sides have now agreed that shipments will be limited to 4.5 per cent fat and 28 per cent starch. Brussels officials say these arcane measurements make it harder for the US to bring in the protein-rich corn gluten that most undercuts EC cereals in the livestock feed market, where European cereals pro- ducers are losing about 2m tonnes a year to cheaper sub- stitute feeds. The US had threatened action both within Gatt and under the 301 provisions of its Trade Act, to protect its $600m market for the feed in the EC. By the end of next month, the EC has to comply with a Gatt ruling requiring it to recast the subsidies it pays for oilseeds, a far more important European market for the US. However, most member states are unhappy with the commis- sion's compliance proposals, which are a barely disguised slice of the wider reform of the EC farm regime, which they have yet to accept."

   "text_content" : "VENEZUELA'S economy is booming again. After a fierce recession in 1989, the economy grew by 5.3 per cent last year; this year it should grow by another 6 to 7 per cent. Confi- dence among foreign and Ven- ezuelan investors appears buoyant. International reserves are above $13bn, and the cur- rent account surplus is likely to be $3bn this year. While hardly believing it is true, many talk about a \"new\" Vene- zuela and the permanence of the current economic reforms. Two and a half years ago, when Carlos Andrds Pdrez was elected president, few would have thought this possible. The country was virtually bank- rupt, with just $300m in foreign reserves, a current account def- icit of $b.8bn, and a budget def- icit of 9.5 per cent of GDP. Mr Pdrez, while president in the 1970s, had ranked as one of Latin America's most populist and interventionist leaders, even by the continent's impres- sive standards. His party, Accion Democratica (AD), the labour unions, the bureaucracy and many businessmen appeared addicted to state lar- gesse and patronage. Most of the country seemed to believe that the Venezuelan state was so rich, thanks to oil revenues, that it need not change. But change it did. Shortly after returning to power Presi- dent Pdrez, with full backing from the International Mone- tary Fund and World Bank, immediately removed price controls, unified and freed the - exchange rate, abolished import licences, committed Venezuela to a steady reduc- tion in tariffs, raised Interest rates, cut spendin, and wel- comed foreign investment. In 1990 and 1991 his govern- ment started, rather hesitantly, the painful and slow task of - restructuring the public sector, through deregulation and pri- - vatisation. The government has already privatised three - banks and a cellular telephone network; this year the national airline, Viasa, the telephone company, CANTV, seven sugar mills, and a shipyard should be - sold. Government ministries have - been streamlined, and the ports will be transferred to regional authorities and run by private companies. The ship- ping sector, steel company, and electricity power companies are all being restructured. Social spending is being tar- geted at the poor through schools and hospitals, and indi- rect subsidies scrapped. And, not least, the govern- ment last year finally reached an accord with its creditors I that led to a $1.9bn cut in prin- f cipal on the roughly $20bn of t debt owed to commercial banks, and a $500m saving on interest payments. The harsh medicine led to riots in February 1989, in which 300 people died; in 1989 i the economy shrank by 8.6 per - cent, the worst recession in liv- r ing memory. But since then, it has rebounded remarkably i fast, and looks set to grow by at least 6 per cent in the next couple of years. Inflation, meanwhile, has continued to fall, albeit slowly, from 81 per cent in 1989, to 36.5 per cent last year. This year it should be around 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Pipe-line welding: with O6bn barrels of proven oil reserves the country should flourish In the next few decades Impressive as the changes are, doubts remain. The first centres on Mr Pdrez, even though, as almost everyone in Venezuela agrees, the pro- gramme could not have been implemented without him. No-one questions that the president has changed his views since the 1970s. Accord- ing to one cabinet colleague, Mr Pdrez has become vehe- mently opposed to all forms of price controls. Likewise, the president, says the cabinet minister, has become \"the big- gest free trader I have ever seen\", often returning from obscure countries with a free- trade pact in his pocket. But unlike, say, Mexico's president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mr Pdrez, according to colleagues, remains suspicious of the private sector, and its ability to invigorate Venezue- la's economy. His former pri- vate secretary, Julio Camino, reports that Mr P6rez has two faces, populist and liberal, but the \"balance of the faces is populist\". Mr Pdrez has thus so far refused to countenance the pri- vatisation of the steel, alumin- ium and oil industries. More dangerously, his government has recently embarked on a large increase in public-sector investment, without first sec- uring the necessary increase in tax revenues. This year public sector investment should reach Bs (Bolivars) 547.2 bn ($10.13bn), roughly a 20 per cent increase in real terms on investment last year, thanks to big increases in spending on social. prqgrammes, infrastruc- ture works, and public compa- nies. PDVSA, the giant state oil company, will spend the lion's share of the money. This year it should spend some Bs 201bn ($4bn); in the next six years around $34bn. It thereby hopes to increase production to 3.5m barrels of oil per day, from the current 2.24m b/d. Such investment is perhaps at odds with the government's professed desire to create a diversified economy, less dependent on oil. Unless Con- gress passes the tax-reform Bill before it, it also threatens the economic stabilisation plan. Worryingly, even investment President Perez is said to have both a populist and a liberal face; but the latter is the more Important in the non-oil exporting sector is being steered by the govern- ment through so-called mega- projects - huge joint public and private sector investments selected by the government - mainly in aluminium, petro- chemicals, paper and pulp. This too suggests that the visi- ble hand of the state will con- tinue to play a big part in Venezuela's economy. Congressmen from Mr Perez's party will certainly egg him on in his statist instincts. For Mr Pdrez has so far pushed his economic reforms through Congress against the wishes of his own party. Whether his successor, if less adroit or less committed, will have similar political suc- cess after the 1993 elections is another question. The reform process could well fall foul of opposition in Congress. A reversal of some reforms can- not be entirely ruled out. That at least is a view preva- lent in Venezuela, but there are some signs that the power of the old party stalwarts is sliding. One indication is the current spate of corruption scandals, involving the mili- tary, ex-president Jaime Lusin- chi and his inner circle, labour leaders and close associates of Mr Pdrez. The allegations, while not particularly remark- able by Venezuelan standards, are notable for the speed and aggressiveness with which they are being pursued, sug- gesting a growing dissatisfac- tion with the old, corrupt ways of Venezuela's political system. The political parties are steadily losing power in more obvious ways. The AD has in the past couple of years lost most of the important gover- norships to opposition parties. The state governors and city mayors are now elected directly, rather than being appointed; in the party prima- ries for these posts, the party stalwarts lost heavily. Soon, state assemblies and up to a half of national Congressmen will be directly elected, and not, as now, picked by party headquarters, further weakening the tradi- tionalist corporatist structures in the two main parties. The danger is that Venezuela will become increasingly diffi- cult to govern as the old politi- cal system crumbles. This is a particular concern in view of the unpopularity of the eco- nomic reform programme, and its failure, so far, to raise the living standards of the major- ity of Venezuelans. In the past months there have been scat- tered protests and riots. Mr Pdrez, nevertheless, appears determined to consoli- date his economic reforms in time for the next election. Accordingly, his administra- tion has recently sent Congress legislation that will strengthen the independence of the central bank. His government wants to share the proceeds from the proposed value added tax, also before Congress, with the states, who will then become responsible for major parts of health and education spending. By 1993 many key industries - such as telephones, ports, pub- lic utilities - should be in pri- vate hands or management. If Mr Pdrez manages all these reforms, and there is no big outbreak of public opposi- tion, then Venezuela's econ- omy should flourish in the next few decades. For a coun- try with 60bn barrels of proven oil reserves, huge quantities of coal, iron ore, bauxite, hydro- electric power, fertile land and easy access to the US, anything else would be a failure.",

   "text_content" : "The first results of reform are promising, writes Damian Fraser nA time of exciting changes: Venezuelans converse ny Gre A time of exciting changes: Venezuelans converse In Plaza Bolivar, the main square of Caracae VENEZUELA is now in the third year of its economic reform programme, and, after a sharp recession in 1989, the effects have been remarkably positive. The worst of the economic imbalances have been removed. The public sector def- icit was reduced from 9.4 per cent of GDP in 1988 to a 1.3 per cent in 1989. Last year, admit- tedly with the help of higher oil revenues, the government ran a budget surplus of 1 per cent of GDP; this year the gov- ernment is promising a bal- anced budget. The current account deficit, thanks to an overvalued exchange rate, ran to $5.8bn in 1988 (roughly 10 per cent of GDP), but swung into a surplus of $8.2bn in 1990; this year, with lower oil prices, it should be around $3bn, according to Mr Pedro Rosas, vice-minister at the planning ministry. Inter- national reserves, just $300m when President Pdrez took office, have risen to some $13bn (from $lObn in 1990). Meanwhile, the economy has rebounded from the depths of the 1989 recession (when GDP fell by an unprecedented 8.6 per cent). Last year growth was 5.6 per cent; this year the government reckons it will reach 6 to 7 per cent. Unem- ployment, while difficult to judge, also seems to be faHlwi from 10 per cent at the end of ast year, to 85 per cent today. The cloud on the horlaon is the inflation rate and the level of public sector spending Infla- tion has fallen more slowly than the government would have liked - this year, accord- ing to Dr. Ros it saould be cose to 28 per cent. In part this is due to continued imreaes in government spending; the government has met its bdge deficit targets through increased revenues, rather than lower speiri. In any other country this would not matter too much. Increased government reve- nues would imply greater tax proceeds. The dampening effect on consumer spending would largely offset the boost to domestic demand given by greater government spending. In Venezuela, however, some two-thirds of government reve- nues comes from oil receipts; these have financed most of the increase in public spend- ing. So, although the public sector deficit, compared with other countries, is small, the near doubling in consolidated government expenditures from 1989 to 1991 has not been matched by an increase in non- oil tax revenues, or private-sec- tor saving. Domestic demand has thus shot up. The government is now thinking rather belatedly of ways, beyond merely keeping interest rates high, of ensuring that domestic demand is not at the mercy of the changes in Venezuela's oil revenues. To start with, the govern- ment is now trying to re-mple- ment an oil contingency fund, where revenues from oil above a pre-set target price are put untouched into a fund (denom- inated in dollars); the fund is drawn down when the oil price falls below target. Such a fund was established last yea, but did not work too succesfully. Of the SLbn in windfall oil profits earned In 1990. the government spent some bm in paying off inter- national commercial b s (as a result of the Brady debt deal); most of the rest was speat by PDVSA to pay toes, or finance its ncrease in avestaMnt. TIae goveI- et wmouMd o Hhe to pas a law that will guarantee that all moey from oil above an ofilal target wll go to the fund, which adwt be touched by tOe govenument or PDVSA. Second, the plan- ning ministry is investing in a new \"integrated information system\", which tells exactly when the government is hand- ing out money and to whom. That way the central bank can immediately offset the impact of government spending on the money supply by selling gov- ernment bonds at the moment government disbursements are handed out. Finally, the administration is is pushing for fiscal reform, which it hopes will enable a bigger slice of government rev- enues to come from direct and indirect taxes. The new tax Bill, passed in July, will lead to a reduction in corporate and personal taxes from the current rate of 50 per cent to 30. The Binll does not eliminate many of the myriad tax exemp- tions that currently are allowed. Nor did Congress agree to a new value-added Bill In the next few months Congress will vote on the VAT Bill again. If t is passed, gov- ernment revenues will increase automatically as the economy grows. At present, direct and indirect personal or corporate taxes account for just 3 per cent of government revenues. While the government has been slow to act on reforming the tax laws, its record on trade reform has been much more impressive. Until 1989, imports required a special UTnmB, which was granted on conadition that domestic pro- daserI did not object If su- cesscal, Imports frequently would sIl prbaohibive tar- .fl Howerer mons, but nt ot ll hwta, could be brought in at the offlcial exchange rate, mu 1M per cnt overaled Exporters, on the other hnC ware pesiend by Jew- lIg to surrenaer foreign at as !klmr bit wer - espuma.sd by fairly ad-hoc export subsidies, cheap credit, and currency retention schemes. In a recent report the World Bank concluded the trade sys- tem \"was so complex that it is impossible to determine its beneficiaries from a priori the- ory. These programmes lead to distortions and widespread cor- ruption. The industrial sector during the 1980s is a story of weak growth, diminishing pro- ductivity, low capacity utilisa- tion and reduced investment\" The government has now abandoned these schemes. The exchange rates are unified and free to float; export subsidies have been removed; import licences for most products scrapped; tariffs are being reduced on a staggered basis, starting with a maximum of 80 per cent in 1989 and falling to 20 per cent after 1992. Most indirect subsidies to businesses have been eliminated. Venezuela's structural reform has in the past two years been profound, more so in many ways than Mexico's, with which it is often com- pared. Venezuela, for example, has scrapped almost al price controls. Mexico stil reles on them to control inflation.

   "text_content" : "Gary Mead on the pressures for radical reform MUCH of Venezuela's economy is pushing back the barriers to competition and foreign invest- ment. But its financial sector is still subject to the wild volatil- ity which made the 13 year old Caracas stock exchange the world's largest riser in 1990, after having lost 35 per cent in US dollar terms in 1999. In the course of last year the Caracas index soared by 610 per cent in US dollar terms and by 720 per cent in bolivares. Total market capitalisation doubled, to more than $7bn. The instability points to the urgent need for radical reforms. According to Mr Oscar Garcia Mendoza, presi- dent of Banco Venezolano de Credito, the current Venezue- lan laws on banking \"are highly complicated and dis- courage competition. Our national banks in general have still not made the necessary adjustments and will in the future have substantial prob- lems unless they reform them- selves\". One crucial reform in this sector is Decree 727, passed in January 1990. It permitted for- eign purchases and sales of Venezuelan shares without prior approval. The decree is believed to have been one rea- son why the Caracas bolsa per- formed so well last year. Another reason was the repatriation by individual investors of some of Venezue- la's estimated $50bn from over- seas. They wanted the money to enter the market created by high-yield 90 day zero-coupon bonds issued to siphon off liquidity created by the steep devaluation in 1989. Mr Ralph von Specht, a Caracas-based investment banker, thinks that up to $3bn flight capital may have been repatriated last year. But despite Decree 727, there are still important restrictions, imposed in 1974, against for- eign investment in banks, insurance and security service companies and in companies engaged in basic industries such as oil, steel and iron. For- eign holdings in such indus- tries and companies are still restricted to a maximum of 20 per cent. Added to capital gains taxes of 50 per cent - there are plans to reduce this to 30 per cent - Venezuela still lacks a positive financial climate to offset its political insecurity. Foreign companies have been deterred from entering ome mining areas by capital gains tax of more than 60 per cent. This heavy tax burden is set to be reduced and the whole highly complex corpo- rate tax system simplified, if Congress finally agrees to pass a tax reform package which w.ill include for the first time a value added tax. Probably one of the more important indicators of change in the economy was the estab- ishment in October 1990 of CONAPRI, the Consejo Nacional de Promocion de nversiones (National Council for Investment Promotion), a mixed government-private sec- tor entity. CONAPRI's main function is o provide services to investors ilready in Venezuela. But it has other roles, particularly to obby for a wide range of eco- nomic liberalisation laws. According to senior CONA- PRI official, the present gov- ernment is working fast to make the country highly attractive for overseas inves- ors. \"I think if a group of wise people were asked to form the best cabinet possible, they would not choose one much different from today's.\" The most important develop ment is the proposed reform of the national financial system, currently under consideration n Congress. It proposes to open up Venezuela's banking :ector to considerably ncereased foreign competition; o tighten accounting norms and give greater teeth to reg- ilatory authorities; to place much greater restrictions on deposit/loan levels; and to tidy up the structure of the sinan :ial market place. New banks will be required to establish a minimum capital base of Bs .5bn, and all existing banks will be required \"substan ially\" to increase their capital base. Current banking law per mits loans up to 20 times a bank's reserves. But for some politicians and inefficient local banks the most sepsitive reform is that which promises to allow the opera- tion of foreign banks. It pro- poses that within five years of the law's pasall foreign banks will owed to oper- ate in Venezuela on exactly the same basis as local baoks. Foreign capital interested in owning Venezuelan banks rather than setting up local branches of overseas banks will be permitted to take an initial 20 per cent of local banks, and 100 per cent control subject to government approval However, the government is aware that liberalisation of a banking system, particularly in Latin America, can be a mixed blessing. Officials fear that traffickers in neighbouring Colombia might seek to benefit from Venezuela's bank reforms. Mr Jose Rodriguez Aznar, vice-president of the central bank, promised at the start of July this year that for- eign investors interested in buying shares in Venezuelan banks will not find it a simple matter.\"It is not sufficient to have the capital and to fulfil the formal requirements\", he said.",

Company officials say that the imported component of the plan stands at around 40 per cent of total outlays. These investments reflect policies developed by PDVSA and its owner, the Venezuelan govern- ment, that foresee large increases in production and exports of Venezuelan petro- leum throughout the 1990s; increased investments in oil refining and distribution systems in the US, Europe and other areas; and major expan- sions in the production and export of natural gas, petro- chemkals and coal.

   "text_content" : "VENEUELA'S contemporary political scene is like a Chinese - dish which tastes exaly oppop- site to what onexpcts. Snce 19M9 Venezueli has had a presi dent who, in the 1970s, sup- ported quasi-socialist state con- trol, but who in his second (and constitutionally last) term of office has embraced market economics. Carlos Andrds Perez has. changed direction agaitist the wishes of most of his own polit- ical party, the social demo- cratic Accion Democratica (AD), in Congress. Like Carlos Menem in Argentina, P6rek took office amidst nation- wide protests - which left about n300 dead - and near economic collapse. Both lead- ers defied the their political supporters to push through emergency economic measures. Perez had an added reason for being able to resist the dic- tates of his party: since he is prevented from running for the presidency again by Venezue- la's constitution he does not depend on it for reelection. Many officials inside Vene- zuela believe that the apparent radical change in his policies springs from his highly prag- matic nature. Economic reform 'is also the international vogue and success will help to secure him a place in history. Likc the Argentine leader, President P6rez has produced an unexpected and spicy dish; and the meal Is far from over. Since 189 apolitical consensus haa developed between the pr- Perez faction of the AD and the main opposition Christian Democratic Comite de Organi- dci6n Politica Electoral Inde- pendiente (Cope). But there Is some fear that, if the reforms do not produce all-round improved living standards, a charismatic old-style politician full of demagogic promises could return to power when the next presidential election are held in 1993. Long-term expatriate resi- dents in the business commu nity, are impressed not only by the speed of Venezuela's ecc nomic reforms but the political will to continue those reforms. Mr John Warner, president of the American chamber of com- merce in Caracas and local chief executive of Heinz, com- pares the situation with that of Chile. \"Pinochet took much longer to change the Chilean economy than this govern ment, a genuine bona fide democracy, has done to change Venezuela's\", he says. For Mr Warner the main threat would be the return of a populist president and Congress, but he regards it as \"the small proba- bility of a large risk\". Under Pdrez, Venezuela is involved in international arrangements which, to some extent, should prevent its return to trade protectionism and inward-looking political policies. Mr Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, president of Vene- zuela's department of foreign trade, pointed out that by the end of 1991 Venezuela and its partners in the Andean Pact (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) will have completely free tade between themselves, including an \"open skies\" pol icy allowing any of the five nations to fly without restric- tions to any of the others. In 1990, Venezuela joined the Gatt. For Mr Mendoza, \"the most important thing is that, for the frst time, the private sector has begun to believe in the permanence of these changes\". Nevertheless, a populist backlash has begun to develop led by Mr Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's president between 1969-74 and a founder of the copei. Mr Caldera has yet to formalise his break with the Copei, but is expected to do so in the next few months. Mr Eduardo Fernandez, sec- retary general of the Copei, is currently running ahead in the opinion polls against Pdrez, old-guard AD supporters and Mr Caldera. But the Copei split might so weaken the party that a revanchist sector of the AD, opposed to the President's reform programme and depen- dent on the traditional allies of the AD - the CTV or Confed- eraci6n de Trabajadores de Venezuela, the country's larg- est union federation - might secure power on a mandate to reverse the reform programme. However, the most likely focus for such an AD-led anti- reform, anti-Perez policy is the previous president, Mr Jaime Lusinchi. But his reputation has been badly damaged both by the economic mess he left behind and the mounting alle- gations of corruption in his last days in office. At present, Mr Eduardo Fernindez is the political leader most favoured to win the presidency next time around. His closest aides prom- ise that, if anything, Mr Fern- Andez would go even further down the privatisation road than Pdrez. \"In particular, Fernandez would privatise the CVG heavy industry complex in Guayana; Pdrez wouldn't dare do that,\" said Mr Anibal Romero, one of Mr Fernandez's chief advisers. The FernAndez programme, according to Mr Romero, dif- fers from that of Pdrez only in terms of degree and commit- ment. \"Pdrez was forced to begin a process which was highly contrary to his own inner convictions - if he has any,\" said Mr Romero. Thus the Fernindez wing of Copei suggests it aims to improve education, health and other basic social provisions by removing elements of them from state control. \"One of the great things about the Pdrez experience is that it has shown us the criti- cal areas for change,\" said Mr Romero.",

   "text_content" : "Joseph Mann on the strategy of a $10bn growth programme Airline passenger's view of Caracas: an oil-rich capital with soaring ambitions and a wish to join the ideological mainstream 1 VENEZUELA already owns and operates one of the world's largest petroleum refining complexes, plans to invest $10bn in domestic and interna- tional refining plants over the next five years. These investments are moti- vated by several factors. New capacity in refining and exports represents a key ele- ment in the company's long-term strategy of capturing a larger share of petroleum markets in Europe and the US. PDVSA is increasing its home refining capacity and strengthening its market pres- ence abroad by upgrading and expanding its existing refining plants, and by acquiring equity stakes (that is, buying market share) in established oil resin- ing and distribution systems in America and Europe. The company has said it plans to invest about $2bn in its overseas refineries over the next few years, not including what it may spend on new acquisitions. Through its Ger- man partner Veba Oel, PDVSA recently acquired an interest in a 230,000 barrel per day (b/d) refinery in Schwedt, formerly owned by the East German government. Last year it also acquired a 50 per cent interest in a US refinery in New Jersey. Moreover, PDVSA wishes to export a high percentage of refined products, rather than crude oil, and will need more domestic refining capacity to handle greater volumes of crude - especially heavy oils - that it will produce in com- ing years. At the same time, some new investments will be aimed at increasing the volume of high- value export products coming out of its home refineries. Last year, PDVSA's six domestic refineries processed an average of 917,000 b/d of crude oil, generating a wide range of products that includes gasoline, kerosene, naphthas, distillates, residual fuel oil and speciality products. Most of these refined products were exported. Overseas, PDVSA owns two refineries in the US, holds equity positions in nine others located in Europe and Amer- ica, and leases another in Curacao. PDVSA's home and overseas refining capacity currently stands at more than 2.6m b/d, and the company supplies most of the crude oil used by its international refining affiliates and subsidiaries. PDVSA's investments through 1996 are designed to raise the company's refining capacity by 400,000 to 500,000 b/ d. This will be accomplished by adding around 200,000 b/d of processing capacity to the country's existing refineries, boosting capacity at the Isla refinery in Curacao (leased by PDVSA), perhaps by 100,000 b/ d, and by building a new refi- nery in eastern Venezuela to process heavy crude oils. The Venezuelans wish to find a foreign partner to share the costs of erecting a new refi- nery for processing heavy oil, which will use a costly process called deep conversion. A refinery of this type, with processing capacity of 100,000 b/d, would cost between $2.5- $3bn. Venezuela has large reserves of heavy crude oils, ranging from 14 degrees API down- ward, and these crudes - con taining heavy quantities of sul phur, nickel and other metals - cannot be handled by nor- mal oil refineries. PDVSA is also interested in finding international partners for other refining ventures, both at home and abroad. Over the last six months, the company has signed letters of intent with BP, Veba Oel, Elf Aquitaine, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI) and Amoco calling for feasibility studies in joint-venture refining projects, especially in heavy oil. So far, the most likely prospects for an association in heavy petro- leum seem to be Veba and Amoco, according to govern- ment officials. While Venezuela's heavy crude is much less valuable - and more difficult to process - than light and medium crudes from the Middle East, PDVSA is trying to market it in terms of strategic advantage. A European or American oil company that links up with PDVSA in a deep conversion refinery will face high initial capital costs, but will be ensured of long-term access to Venezuela's huge proved oil reserves. The Venezuelans also point out that they are not subject to the political instability endemic to the Middle East, and thus can be counted on as a reliable supplier (especially to clients who are also their business partners) in times of conflict.",

   "text_content" : "FOR many years, Venezuela's state-owned petrochemical sec- tor was viewed as a prime example of government mis- management. The State-owned Venezuelan Petrochemical Institute (IVP) accumulated hundreds of mil- lions of dollars in losses during the 1970s. The company was plagued by plant breakdowns, scandals and rampant political interference. In 1977, the Venezuelan gov- ernment decided to give full control of the IVP to the national oil company, Petro- leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). The old petrochemi- cal company was converted into a new PDVSA subsidiary, Pequiven, and began a long process of reforms and improvements under a new management team. By 1983, Pequiven had con- verted its industrial plants into an efficient operation, and began generating net profits. Pequiven's story stands out as an example of successful gov- ernment management in a region where State-owned com- panies often are financial disasters. Pequiven today is a profit- able, well-managed company. Last year it posted net earn- ings of $37m on turnover of $330m. Production at Pequiven's own plants in 1990 was 2.5m tonnes, while other plants where it is an equity partner produced another l.lm tonnes of petrochemicals. (PDVSA also owns petrochemical facili- ties in the US and Europe, but production figures given here cover only its plants on Ven- ezuelan soil.) Pequiven oper- ates three petrochemical com- plexes in Venezuela, and has an aromatics (BTX) plant located at an oil refinery called El Palito. The company's exports last year totalled $72.1m, up from $68.4m in 1989. Pequiven currently is in the midst of a major expansion programme.. It plans invest- ments of $5.7bn through 1996 to raise national petrochemical production capacity from the present level of nearly to 4m tonnes per year to 14m tonnes per annum. These capacity fig- ures include plants fully owned by Pequiven, plus joint ven- tures between Pequiven and private investors. The strategy is to make use of Venezuela's abundant reserves of natural gas (more than 3.4 trillion cubic meters) as the raw material for a broad range of petrochemical prod- ucts, most of which will be exported. If all the elements in the cur- rent expansion scheme are implemented, Pequiven will build more than 30 new plants to produce a dizzying array of plastics, industrial chemicals, fertilisers and other items. In addition, it is expanding sev- eral existing facilities. Pequiven's development plan lays special stress on new capacity for producing oxygen- ates, that is, compounds such as MTBE (methyl tertiary-bu- tyl ether) that are used to boost octane in motor gasoline. The demand for oxygenates is growing briskly as environ- mental regulations in the US and Europe call for the pro- gressive elimination of lead, which was traditionally used as an octane booster but which is a major air pollutant. Some of the new plants Pequiven plans to erect - either alone or in partnership with private companies - are: methanol; MTBE; propylene; ethylene; low-density polyeth- ylene; styrene; PVC; ammonia, urea, sulphuric acid, caustic soda; chlorine; ethylene oxide, and a variety of specialty prod- ucts. Negotiations are already advanced with foreign inves- tors for some of these joint- venture projects, Pequiven offi- cials said. Foreign partners expected to be involved in these projects are Combustion Engineering(US); Ecofuel (Italy); Repsol (Spain); and Jap- anese investors. The government is consider- ing the approval of a total of $611m in debt-equity swaps to finance several large petro- An exploo n ninwan m usrn vnuuu: nm awan or new n mau ro r iu ana oy-proucu .,.. .Â·a Â·Â· ~i~Â·-.?;Â·,::Â·-Â·Â· Â· i : chemical projects worth $2.6 n. In June, a group of interna- tional banks led by Citicorp arranged two swaps for -equiven totalling $243m. The -company will apply these funds to the financing of two plants it is building with its own resources: a $428m olefins acility and a $392m chlorine and caustic soda plant. Currently, Pequiven and international partners are building several other new plants. At the Zulia complex in western Venezuela, Pequiven, Mitsui and Venezuelan inves- tors are completing work on a 70,000 tonnes per year polypro- pylene plant. And at a nearby site, Pequiven, Olin, the Inter- national Finance Corp. and Corimon, a Venezuelan con- cern, are building a plant to make ethylene oxide (16,000 tonnes) and ethylene glycol (66,000 tonnes). In March of this year, Pequiven and Ecofuel, a unit of Italy's national oil company, ENI, put into operation a $297m facility to produce 500,000 tonnes a year of MTBE in eastern Venezuela. At the same time, Ecofuel announced it would build a $330m facility to make methanol (670,000 tonnes per year) at the same site. On its own, Pequiven is cur- rently erecting facilities for producing olefins, caustic soda ana cmorme, ana is compleung infrastructure work at its pet- rochemical complex at Anzoa- tegui, in the east. It is also expanding capacity at three other facilities. Pequiven's ambitious $5.7bn expansion plan calls for more than $2bn in direct invest- ments to be made by the com- pany, plus financing from joint venture partners and other sources. Pequiven's president, Mr Hugo Finol, estimated that around 60 per cent of funding for the 1991-96 plan would come from private investors (both international and Ven- ezuelan), as well as from sup- plier credits, debt-equity swaps and other sources. Peuqiven's interest in joint ventures with foreign partners is not based solely on financial considerations. The Venezue- lan company also wants to gain access to advanced tech- nology, and to obtain the help of foreign partners in market- ing Venezuelan petrochemicals internationally. Pequiven's investment pro- gramme seems generally well conceived. However, some of its projects may have to be stretched out beyond 1996 since Pequiven's owner, PDVSA, is also carrying out a massive investment scheme. This means that over the next few years, thdre will be heavy competition for flnaic- ing to cover a lae number of proects in the o and petro chemical sectors, as well as competition for speciaised ser- vices (such as certain types of engineering), skilled workers rif capital goods. Under the current govern- ment, which took office in early 1990, Pequiven has made real progress on turning pro- jects into reality. But some of Pequiven's big projects have been under discussion for.four or five years, and the govern- ment only recently took action on long-promised debt-equity swaps for the petrochemical sector. Much to Pequiven's regret, official foot-dragging on the swap programme has turned off some potential investors. For example, Norsk Hydro, which planned to invest in a large ammonia project with Pequiven, reportedly withdrew in June. The company appar- ently got tired of waiting for action on swaps, and for a final decision on a project that has been under discussion for sev- eral years. Some analysts worry that Venezuela's big push in petro- chemical exports will face stiff competition, especially since Saudi Arabia and other oil pro- ducers are also making big capacity increases in petro- chemicals. However, Pequiven officials say they are confident that Venezuela's comparative advantages will allow it to compete effectively, even under tight market conditions.",

   "text_content" : "VENEZUALA'S national oil company, PDVSA, is making a big push to increase its proved reserves of crude oil and its crude production capacity as part of a plan to gain a heftier share of the world petroleum market. The company's goals in this area are: * to add more than 9bn bar- rels of crude oil to its reserves over the next five years through exploration for \"new\" oil and by developing addi- tional reserves from existing oilfields; * to raise crude oil produc- tion potential to 3.5m-3.6m bar- rels per day (b/d). These activities will require substantial investments: $1.7bn for exploration and $16.2bn for production. PDVSA produced an average of 2.48m b/d of crude oil Venezuela has the west's largest proven reserves of crude - but they are for the most part heavy oils (including condensates and natural gas liquids) during the first four months of this year, and the company's production potential now stands at more than 2.8m b/d. The goal of increasing out- put capacity by more than 25 per cent over the next five years is a formidable chal- lenge, requiring extensive exploration to replace oil that is being produced, and produc- tion maintenance to keep the wells flowing, even in old fields. Venezuela has 26,531 wells capable of producing oil; of this total, 12,172 were active at the end of 1990. PDVSA currently has the largest proved reserves of crude oil in the Western Hemi- sphere: 60.1bn barrels. But since the bulk of the country's reserves is made up of heavy oils, the company's exploratory efforts will be directed at find- ing new deposits of light and medium crude. Most of the exploratory work is being carried out in the east- ern states of Monagas and Anzoategui; Lake Maracaibo; the Andean flank south of the lake; the Perija sector of Zulia state, and Guarico state. Exploration work alone is expected to yield 5bn barrels of additional light and medium oil reserves by the end of 1996, while investments in existing oil fields should allow the com- pany to tap another 4bn bar- rels of crude. Since many of Venezuela's oilfields have been producing for several decades, PDVSA must invest heavily each year in the production sector in order to maintain output at desired levels. Investments of this type typi cally involve drilling new wells to advance production areas in existing fields; repairs and overhaul of active wells; and secondary recovery techniques such as reinjection of water and gas into oil structures to maintain subterranean pres- sure. PDVSA's production plans through 1996 call for drilling 7,560 advance and development wells Oin existing olield1 car- ryinr out more tha 1n0000 weB repair and wo-rowers; ad\"ine Iam cabic metre per day o gas clmpmsmeO capacity (aor indjecton into deposits); and makting ir uents In a ange of other production-related activities. Both production and explor- atory work will require consid- erable assistance from oil ser- vice companies outside Venezuela. Like other interna- tional oil companies, PDVSA relies on specialised companies to carry out many of these tasks. Aside from PDVSA's direct investments in exploration and production, the company is also seeking foreign invest- ment in these upstream activi- ties for the first time since Venezuela's oil industry was nationalised in 1976. Earlier this year, PDVSA asked for international oil com- panies to bid on contracts to operate 46 inactive oilfields. These fields can produce up to several thousand barrels per day each, but PDVSA believes they are uneconomical to oper- ate for a company of its size. PDVSA is interested in sign- ing up foreign concerns as con- tractors to operate the fields, probably paying the operators a fee per barrel produced. Many companies have expressed interest in the plan, but PDVSA has not yet announced any decision. The Venezuelan oil company also has discussed the possibil- ity of allowing foreign compa- nies to invest directly in explo- ration, as opposed to working for PDVSA as a paid service contractor. Foreign executives approached by PDVSA say that there has been no progress in this area. PDVSA proposes to assign new exploratory zones to for- eign companies, who would take the risk of making all nec- essary investments. (PDVSA is reserving traditional, less risky exploratory sectors for itself.) If oil is discovered, the for- eign investor could receive a share of future production or some kind of payment. How- ever, this and other important The president who nationalised the Industry In 1976 Is urging foreign companies to reinvest points remain unclear. PDVSA will proceed cau- tiously in approving any for- eign investment in oil explora- tion and production, since these areas are still a highly- charged nationalist issue in Venezuela. Ironically, President Carlos Andrds Pirez had nationalised the Venezuelan oil industry back in 1976, during his first term of office. Today, President Pdrez's administration is trying to con- vince foreign oil companies to invest again in Venezuelan petroleum. A test case involving foreign investment in the oil and gas sector is now awaiting action by the Venezuelan Cam . as expected, the Congress approves a $3bn natral gas venture, in which PDVSA and three Internatiokal c a are partners, this shoumomn the door to additional loign investment in the petroleum sector The legislature Is scheduled to decide on the project which involves investments by Ei Ral Dutchn a md Mitsubishi, In the early",

Backed by over 75 years of technical, managerial and commercial experience in the petroleum sector, the PDV Group's interests are now widely diversified, including natural gas, petrochemicals, coal and bitumen. Development strategy during the next few years will center on increasing crude production and refining capacity; expanding activities in the petrochemical sector within Venezuela together with private capital, both national and foreign; raising production in the coal sector, also through joint ventures; marketing of Orimulsi6nm, a new bitumen- based boiler fuel; and consolidating PDV's presence abroad through refining and marketing activities. The PDV Group already has a large refining capacity, both in Venezuela and overseas, allowing it to process 80 per cent of the petroleum produced by its three oil operating companies and to market value-added products rather than crude oil. Approximately seven out of every eight barrels of oil produced in Venezuela are sold on the international market, either as crude or products.

Mr Luis Urdaneta, president of Carbozulia, PDVSA's coal sub- sidiary, said that the Guasare basin has proven coal reserves of 353m tonnes, identified reserves of over 2bn tonnes and hypothetical reserves of more than 6bn tonnes. Guasare coal is \"premium quality steam coal with high volatility and thermal values, and low sulphur content\", according to the Carbozulia executive. Most coal in the Guasare fields can be extracted via surface mining techniques, he added. Successive governments in Venezuela have been talking about large-scale commercial exploitation of the Guasare fields since the mid-1970s. But until now, relatively little has been done. In the past, delays in developing Guasare's sub- stantial coal reserves were caused by a lack of govern- ment funds, and by a high tax rate on mining activities that discouraged private invest- ment. But the Venezuelan Con- gress recently decided to reduce tax levied on mining companies' operating profits from 60 to 30 per cent, a move that should promote new investment in coal and other mining sectors Carbozulia has operated an open pit mine at the Paso Dia- blo sector of the Guasare fields since 1987, working in partner- ship with Agip Coal of Italy and Arco Coal of the US. It also has identified three other mine sites at Guasare - Socuy, Mina Nobte and Cachiri - that Governments have talked about exploiting the substantial coal reserves for nearly 20 years but have been stalled by lack of funds and a high tax it plans to develop with foreign companies. Mr Urdaneta said that his company's goal is to produce more than 11.5m tpa of coal at three or four sites in the Guas- are fields by 1996. This stage alone will require investments of around $1.8bn, to be shared by Carbozulia and interna- tional partners in joint ven- tures. Under current plans, output at Paso Diablo would rise to 6.5m tpa by 1996, and produc- tion would begin at three other sites on a staggered basis, reaching around 5m tpathe same year. All current production from Guasare - about 1.5m* tpa year since 1989 - is exported, and Carbozulia plans to export any future output from the Guas- are fields. Last year, 87 per cent of Guasare's exports went to Europe, while the remainder was shipped to the US and the Caribbean. Carbozulia and Agip Coal (a subsidiary of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) operate the Paso Diablo mine, the first mine opened in the Guasare region, under a joint venture called Carbones del Guasare. The two partners plan to raise produc- tion at Paso Diablo to 2.5m tonnes this year, and progres- sively increase output to 6.5m tpa by 1996 and 10m tpa by 1998. (Arco Coal was a partner in the venture with Agip and Carbozulia, but pulled out ear- lier this year.) Investments in Paso Diablo last year exceeded o30m. Paso Diablo is an open pit mine, and coal currently is moved to a loading station on Lake Maracaibo via heavy trucks. Barges then load the coal on to bulk carriers anchored in the lake for export. In order to produce more than 3.5m-4m tpa, the Paso Dia- blo partners (and other inves- tors) will have to build a 70-80 km railway and a port on the lake. The railway-port project alone is expected to cost around $lbn, and Carbozulia hopes to work out a scheme under which it and other mine operators will share these investment costs. Carbozulla Is making prog- ress toward expanding the country's coal ouput. PDVSA has earmarked part of Its future export revenues to help finance Carbozulia projects, and the coal subsidiary has located international partners interested in sharing capital costs. Carbozulia is working with four international companies and a Venezuelan concern to develop two new mines in Guasare. Shell and Veba Oel are studying the feasibility of setting up a joint venture with the Venezuelans to exploit the Socuy sector. Investment for exploration and other items this year at the Socuy mine is projected at $3.5m. Carbozulia plans to start pro- duction at Socuy in 1995 (at 500,000 tpa) and reach 4.5m tonnes by 1998. To develop this mine, investments of $650m will be required. Carbozulia recently signed an agreement with A.T. Mas- sey and a Venezuelan-Japanese group covering a 20-month exploration programme for another Guasare site, called Mina Norte. The partners, who include Mitsubishi, plan to spend some $3m carrying out test drills at Mina Norte. This mine has proved reserves of 335m tonnes, and coal would be extracted both by strip mining and shafts. Once exploratory work is com- pleted, the partners will decide whether to go ahead with a $100m plan to start production in 1993 and reach 2m tpa by 1996. Carbozulia also wants to exploit two other sites in the Guasare fields: Cachiri and Inciarte. Mr Urdaneta said that his company will start seeking international partners for developing the Cachiri mine this year. Carbozulia's policy is to hold a minority position in any joint ventures where it is a partner.",

   "text_content" : "BESIDES its enormous oil reserves, Venezuela has proven reserves of natural gas which are the ninth largest in the world. According to PDVSA's annual report for 1990, Vene- zuela has some 6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) of which of which 3.429 tem are proven. The PDVSA is expected to invest $16.2bn in crude oil and gas production over the next five years. In 1988, total world reserves of natural gas were estimated at more than 107tcm. World production of natural gas cur- rently stands at roughly 2tcm a year; Latin America produces 90bn cubic metres annually, of which Venezuela's share is 38bn. One of PDVSA's more ambi- tious projects is its $3bn joint venture with Royal-Dutch Shell (UK), Exxon (US) and Mitsubishi (Japan) to produce and export natural gas. It is the first time interna- tional oil companies have been involved as partners in an oil or gas project with Venezuela since it nationalised all its for- eign oil operations in 1975. Lagoven, an operating sub- sidiary of PDVSA, will be the Venezuelan partner in the deal, with 32 per cent of the equity- Shell will have 31 per cent, Exxon 29 per cent and Mitsubi- shi 8 per cent. Exxon's and Shell's activities in Venezuela were among those nationalised; the new joint venture plan is thus a sig- nificant indication of renewed political as well as economic confidence in the stability of the current reform programme. The new joint venture, known as the Cristo'bal Colo'n (Christopher Columbus) proj- ect, will develop previously unexploited underwater gas reserves off the north-east coast of Venezuela. A 50km pipeline is to be built, along with a gas liquefaction plant, -which will enable liquefied nat- ural gas (Ing) to be exported from 196. Construction work is due to start next year. Some 4.4m tonnes a year, worth an estimated $500m at current prices, are expected to be exported to the US from the new fields. As part of the proj- ect, some 56 offshore develop- ment wels are to be drilled and eight platforms erected PDVSA is currently produc- ing 111m cm of natural gas daily, virtually al of which is associated gas tapped during al production. Soe 8 per cent is used t PDVSA 30m ca gm are bck aato fieks (to maintain pressure in fields wtbch In many ca m 49 or IS yea oeld); bt se an are med by the petmUdmial mo to, the domestic and leal inhtrambl market amd MeId petroleum industry operations. As part of the development of this sector PDVSA plans to add compression plants with a total of 765,000 bhp capacity to handle 131m cm daily of gas. It also intends constructing seven new plants for process- ing gas liquids and laying 1,022km of trunk gas pipelines before 1996. A new 400km pro- pane pipeline is due to connect As part of the Christobal Colon venture, 55 offshore wells will be drilled and eight production platforms and a 50 km pipeline built the eastern city of Jose with the central city of Valencia. Extraction of gas liquids now runs at 117,000 barrels per day (b/d), and is set to rise to 230,000 b/d by 1996. Some 23,400 b/d are exported, 39,000 b/d are used locally and the remainder is processed in PDVSA refiner- ies. A further large-scale gas project involves both Vene- zuela and Colombia; 1993 is the target date by which the first natural gas pipeline linking the two countries is due to be completed. The 510km line, with an estimated cost of $500m, will supply Colombia with between 60m-200m cubic feet per day, depending on how much Colombia's own gas fields manage to supply. Con- struction of the pipeline is expected to start early 1992. Venezuela's energy needs are calculated by PDVSA to grow to the oil equivalent of 1.02bn b/d per day by 1995; nat- ural gas will supply 3 per cent of that requirement, consump- tion of gas growing from 32m cm in 1989 to 55m cubic metres daily by 1995. Demand for Ing is anticipated to grow from 1989's level of 40,000 b/d to 125,000 b/d in 1995. While PDVSA believes that Venezuela's reserves are ample to satisfy such growth, it is using all its political leverage to ensure a wide-ranging investment programme gets full government backing. PDVSA plans to invest particu- larly in production and trans- portation facilities, aiming to provide Venezuelan industry with more gas as a substitute for liquid fuels and to meet increasing demand for ethane and propane as a result of expansion in petrochemical capacity.",

   "text_content" : "WHEN Venezuela's president early last year named Andres 80u Pietri to head the coun- try's most important company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the appointment provoked an outburet of criti- dCsm. No one doubted Mr Sosa's Intelligence, or sue- cess as an Indepae t busi- nessman, but the appointment of an \"outsider\" to the oil industry's top post was viewed by many (especially among the ranks of llfe-long oil execu- tives) as a break with recent tradition, and as a blow to the morale of career oilmen who aspire to sit in the chief execu- A clash of wills with the Energy Minister and a threat of resignation lead to better coordination tive's office. After over a year as president of PDVSA, one of the world's largest petroleum companies (gross international revenues were $23bn last year), Mr Sosa has shown him- self to be a first-class execu- tive and an excellent choice for this sensitive post. The 48-year-old Caracas native was able to win the con- fidence of oil industry execu- tives and other employees by maintaining professionalism at all levels, continuing and expanding existing develop- ment plans, and working hard to defend the Interests of the national oil company in Vene- zuela's contentions political arena. One sign of Mr Sosa's acceptance is the fact that there has been no exodus of executive talent at the com- pany. The PDVSA president rejects any political interference that might damage the company's efficiency, and believes that Venezuela is best-served by a well-managed, profitable national oil concern. This view is not always easy to defend in a country where most state- run enterprises are ill-man- aged, overstaffed and in the red. Mr Sosa took over an effi- dcient and profitable company at a time when it was initi- ating its biggest ever develop- ment programme, a $48bn plan to expand PDVSA's presence in world energy markets. An important part of his Job is to ensure that this compli- cated plan - encompassing exploration and production of oil and natural gas, refining, transportation, domestic and international marketing, pet- rochemicals, coal and joint ventures with international investors - moves ahead sat- isfactorily, and does not get bogged down in excessive bureaucracy. Unlb e his predecessors, Mr Sosa frequently has been out- spoken and critical about domestic and international petroleum issues, annoying some politicians with his com- ments on Opec, the excessively high tax rate levied on PDVSA (over 80 per cent), and \"politi- cal\" prices for domestic petrol that cause the company to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Trained as an attorney at the Universidad Catolica And- res Bello (Caracas) and at Har- vard, Mr Sosa worked for sev- eral years as a legal consultant in Venezuela's pet- rochemical sector, and later founded and ran a group of companies that manufacture valves and other specialised products for the petroleum industry. A fluent English speaker, he spent a brief period in politics during the 1970s, serving as an independent senator repre- senting Venezuela's socialist party, MAS. This experience, unusual among Venezuelan oil execu- tives, has helped him to pro- tect PDVSA's interests among politicians, as happened last month during a potentially damaging confrontation with Mr Celestino Armas, the Min- ister of Energy and Mines. During the clash, over an attempt by Mr Armas to restrict PDVSA's autonomy in a number of key areas of pol- Icy and appointments, Mr Sosa offered his resignation to Pres- ident Perez, who refused to accept it. The clash ended in a com- promise whereby PDVSA agreed to consult more closely with the Energy Minister. Joseph Mann So0a: preldentual appointe",

   "text_content" : "THE dollar was little changed in sluggish trade as worries that the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates were offset by some institu- tional demand for the US unit at the lower levels. The currency markets had begun the day in more buoyant mood with the dollar boosted after scattered corporate buy- ing in early European trading. However, any attempt to move out of its recently nar- row trading range was brought to a halt after the latest weekly jobless figures. US jobless claims for the week ending September 14 rose to 439,000, which was around 20,000 above most analysts' forecasts and compared with 403,000 the previous week (although that figure had been lowered by the Labor Day holi- day). The unexpected rise in the jobless total revived concerns about the weakness of the cur- rent economic recovery and once again led to talk that the Fed may be forced to ease mon- etary policy to prevent the economy sliding back into recession. The numbers also reminded the market that the September employment report, which is released on Friday, may also show how fragile the upswing has been.

For now, US money market rates are holding steady with Fed funds unchanged at around 5& per cent. The dollar closed unchanged at DM1.6825; at SFrl.4650; and at FFr5.7325; but was higher at Y133.50 from Y133.25. Renewed speculation about the future of Japan's finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashi- moto, led to some weakness in the yen. Japanese newspapers suggested that Mr Ryutaro night resign after the Group of Seven meetings in mid-Octo- -ber, but speaking to reporters yesterday he said that \"he alone\" would decide on resig- nation. The D-Mark rose to Y79.34 from Y79.25. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta continued to weaken as speculation persisted about a reduction in Spanish interest rates. Yesterday there were no suggestions of intervention by the Bank of Spain and cur- rency analysts believe the peseta could slide further. However, talk that both ster- ling and the peseta could move to the narrower 2% per cent bands within the ERM pro- vides a floor to both curren- cies, dealers said. The D-Mark rose to Pta63.44 from Pta63.10. Within the ERM grid, it fell to just 4.18 per cent over the French franc, the weakest currency in the sys- tem. Last week the peseta was more than 5 per cent over the franc, while on Wednesday it had been 4.61 per cent over.

   "text_content" : "LONDON interest rates fell back yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a smaller daily money market liquidity shortage than had been expec- ted. Three months inter-bank money was down A point at 10%-% per cent; six months was off A at 10&A- per cent; and one year was down h at 10%-A per cent. With money dealers expect- ing the day's liquidity shortage to be around Â£600m and some even anticipating a LÂ£bn shortage, the Bank of RK dl --- Mak h I g raI btu qpImIir 4, 1\"1 England's forecast of Â£300m, which was later revised to Â£200m, put rates under pressure. And unlike the previous two days, the Bank met most of the market's credit needs, with Â£183m of help. The Bank bought Â£123m of bank bills at unchanged rates of 10% per cent and provided late assistance of SOlm. Interest rate futures moved higher as sterling remained steady for much of the IseIsin. December short sterling was up Sat 90.19. In Fiaanrt canll money was unchanged at 8959i per cent after the Bundesbank left monetary policy unchanged at its regular council meeting yesterday. Analysts had not been expecting any change on interest rate policy to emerge from the meeting. The German discount rate remains at 7.50 per cent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 9.25 per cent. Liquidity appeared to be in plentiful supply although money dealers said the market could be tighter today as banks make pension payments and also pay almost DM4bn for new four-year government paper, issued on Wednesday. Banks' reserve holdings at the Bundesbank rose to DM69.0bn on Tuesday from DM67.4bn on Monday to average DM73.lbn for the first 24 days of the month. Banks took up about DMGOOm at the 9.25 per cent Lombard rate on Wednesday, up from about DM300m on Tuesday. In Stockholm the average rate of accepted bids on a seven billion crown reverse repurchase agreement which runs from September 27 to 30 was an unchanged 10.14 per cent. Is New York the Federal Reserve injected temporary reserves into the banking system by way of $3bn in customer repurchase agreements. ed funds were at 5% per cent, sily above the rs d 5% per ant target for m fe o n* rate.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street SHARE PRICES stood stock still yesterday after investors had shrugged off some unex- pected bad news on the econ- omy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.80 at 3,017.22, the index rarely having strayed a few points from its opening mark. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down 0.39 at 386.49, and the Nasdaq composite of over- the-counter stocks eased 0.88 to 526.94. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 159m shares, and rises out- paced declines by 865 to 691. The day's surprises came in the form of a 36,000 rise in weekly initial jobless claims - more than double analysts' estimates - and a revision of the second quarter gross national product estimates to show a decline of 0.5 per cent, instead of the originally calcu- lated fall of 0.1 per cent. The GNP figure suggested the economy was in a deeper trough between April and June than previously thought, which implies that the recov- ery since then will have proved more difficult to achieve than envisaged. Similarly, the jobs data showed that labour condi- tions in the US remain poor. Among individual stocks, Union Carbide fell $1% to $21% in active trading as investors 350 300 250 200 150 100 ma50 $29'/ responded to the news that the company is planning to reduce staffby 14.5 per cent and will make a pre-tax charge against earnings of more than $110m in the third quarter. Pyramid -Technology dropped $1% to $16% in 1.3m shares and AT&T held steady at $38 after a federal govern- NYSE volume Daily (million) 12 13 16 17 18 19 20 23 24 2526 September 1991 ment panel overturned the award of a $1.4bn seven-year office automation contract by the Treasury department to the two companies. The decision was taken after rival bidders, IBM and Lock- heed, protested. AT&T and Pyramid could still win the contract if the Treasury justify its decision, based on the rela- tive price and performance merits of the different bidders. Scimed Life Systems plunged $29% to $57%1 in 6.3m shares e e ii it a Y a Y I- i e r y e r rt e Y I- e s after the company, which announced a 60 per cent rise in fiscal second quarter net income to 78 cents a share, warned that it might have to withdraw a line of its catheters because of patent challenges. McDonald's rose $% to $S5% in volume of 2m shares after the fast-food retailer said that it expected third quarter sales and earnings to top those recorded a year ago. Mercury Air Group climbed $% to $4 on the American Stock Exchange on the news that the company has been in talks with several entities about a possible acquisition or merger of Mercury. Canada TORONTO STOCK prices again ended little changed in moderate trading. Based on preliminary data, the compos- ite index was off just 4.94 to 3,385.14 as losing issues bested winners by 304 to 249. Volume of 20.0m shares was a bit above the previous 19.3m shares and trading value was C$247.5m against C$223.5m. Gold stocks fell 2.34 per cent on index, with American Bar- rick off C$% to C$24%, Echo Bay down C$% to C$8% and Placer Dome off C$% to C$1 %. Otherwise, the major groups showed little movement, with energy, industrial products, mining and financial services all flat and consumer products modestly higher.",

   "text_content" : "SCANDINAVIA was disturbed by weak bank stocks and a Finnish rate rise yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM reacted nega- tively to Nordbanken's eight- month results and its forecast of worse-than-expected credit losses for the year, announced late on Wednesday. The Affiirs- varlden General index dropped 20.5 or 1.9 per cent to 1,042.8, as turnover grew to SKr525m from SKr339m. The banking index fell 4.4 per cent. Nordbanken dropped SKr2 or 5.7 per cent to SKr33 and Gota, the banking and financial group which is due to announce results on Tuesday, saw its A shares shed SKrlO or 11.8 per cent to SKr75. Electrolux free Bs fell SKrll or 3.8 per cent to SKr277, after a broker issued a sell note. HELSINKI also fell sharply, on a rise in interest rates and economic pessimism. The Hex index lost 15.5 or 1.8 per cent to 867.0 in turnover of FM23m. Metsa-Serla was suspended after its leading shareholder, Metsalitto, said that it was forming a group to control the majority of Metsa-Serla votes. OSLO firmed, but banking shares were weak. The all- share index rose 4.20 to 495.08 in turnover of NKr213m, as the bank index fell 1.86 or 3.8 per cent to 47.58. PARIS was stuck in a nar- row range, finishing slightly lower after Wall Street's weak opening. The CAC 40 index lost 1.44 to 1,876.49. Corporate results continued to sway the market. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez dropped FFr15 to FFr534 in volume of 226,660 shares after Wednes- day's late profits news. Paribas rose FFr2.50 to FFr441, but its cement subsidiary, Ciments FranCais dropped FFr22.40 or 7.2 per cent to FFr288.60 after the parent company reported a T-SE E urotrack 100 - Sp 26 Hourly changes Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1 pm 2 pm 3 pm Close 1106.54 1106.86 1106.84 1106.38 1106.37 1105.61 1103.49 1103.42 Day's High 1107.21 Day's Low 1102.48 Sep 25 Sep 24 Sep 23 Sep 20 Sep 19 1108.34 1110.65 1111.18 1114.51 1113.95 BaS value 1000 (26/10/90). fall in six-month earnings. Canal Plus dropped FFr38 or 3.5 per cent to FFr1,038 on reports of a broker's sell recommendation, but Club Mediterrande gained FFr14 or 3.1 per cent to FFr462 after Wednesday's announcement of a joint venture with a German tour operator. FRANKFURT flagged in a sleepy session which saw the DAX index end 5.42 lower at 1,619.99 after a 5.28 fall to 667.65 in the FAZ at midses- sion. Turnover eased from DM4.5bn to DM3.4bn. In carmakers and steels, vul- nerable after IG Metall's wage demands, recent favourites sus- fered most, Volkswagen falling DM3.90 to DM358.90 and Hoesch by DM6 to DM296. Constructions continued to slide after revised estimates for industry growth, Hochtief and Holzmann each losing DM25, to DM1,205 and DM1,220 respec- tively. In basic materials Metallgesellschaft, recently downgraded by BHF Bank because of weak metal prices, dropped DM12.80 to DM456.10. MILAN celebrated a pocket of strength in telecommunica- tions, but this was unable to make up for corporate weak- ness elsewhere, and a nervous reaction to the growing dispute over Italy's budget deficit. The Comit index ended 1.92 lower at 539.39. Sip's announcement late on Wednesday of a 54 per cent rise in profits, far better than ana- lysts had expected, pushed up the telecom group's ordinary share price by L33.50 or 3 per cent to L1,135, and its savings shares by 6 per cent. Stet, Sip's parent comtpany, rose L44 or 2.3 per cent to L1,980 in sympathy. After the close, Stet's own figures showed a profits rise of only 8 per cent. MADRID had discounted the cut in one-year Treasury bill rates, and the general index slipped 1.43 to 276.43. Turnover was moderate at about Ptal5bn, boosted by active trading in utility stocks. AMSTERDAM was kept in check by the weakness of inter- national markets. The CBS ten- dency index eased 0.2 to 90.4. BorsumUi Wehry, the trading group, rose F12.10 to F157.30 after saying that it was in talks to buy a European trading company. US demand lifted Heineken Fl 1.30 to Fl 153.30. ZURICH focused on insurers after a higher profits forecast from Zurich Insurance - where the bearers rose SFr30 to SFr4,130 - and a fall of 22 per cent in 1990 profits at Swiss Re, whose registered shares fell SFr40 to SFr2,010. The Crddit Suisse index fell 3.9 to 514.7. BRUSSELS performed sur- gery on companies linked to Socidtd Gdndrale de Belgique, primarily because of their first half results. Its chemical unit, Gechem, dropped BFr50 or 8.2 per cent to BFr530 as the Bel20 index lost 2.78 to 1,086.11.",

   "text_content" : "R.C. Murthy explains the dichotomy between recent performance and fundamentals HE BOMBAY stock market, which sets the pace for other Indian markets, confounded analysts with its extended gains until the middle of this month. Now they are arguing about whether it is seeing a technical correction, after an unprece- dented bull phase over more than eight months, or whether a sheaf of adverse factors is finally attracting attention. The BSE index attained a record high of 1,912.35 on Sep- tember 16, having doubled in less than eight months. Since then it has hit trouble, and yes- terday's 31.60 fall to 1,786.92 left it 6.6 per cent off the top. Brokers blamed liquidations on the last day of a three-week account, and said widespread buying by state-owned invest- ment houses had failed to bol- ster the market. Negative elements that the investment houses seem to have been ignoring include double-digit inflation, which threatens to wipe out the advantages of July's 18 per cent devaluation of the rupee against the dollar, and high interest rates. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has lifted interest rates on corporate loans to a record 17 to 18 per cent. Growth rates are also in question. Mr Hemendra Kothari, chairman of DSP Financial Consultancy and a leading market analyst, expects growth in profits to slow this year to 20 per cent, from 35 per cent last year; and, according to official forecasts, gross domestic product growth will fall to 3 per cent this year from 5 per cent in 1990. In July, the new government at New Delhi, led by Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, unveiled a package of economic and trade reforms, followed by a deal with the International Mone- tary Fund for a $637m soft loan; another $2.2bn standby arrangement is under negotia- tion. But the World Bank, in its annual report published on Monday, warns: \"The fluidity of the current political situa- India Bombay 30 share Index August 1991 Sep tion makes it difficult to intro- duce the needed fiscal reform.\" Nevertheless, stock market traders believe that the long-term outlook is rosy. They rejoice that India has success- fully avoided an international payments default, and that the government has pulled the economy back from the brink of disaster. This confidence doubled the BSE's market capi- talisation to more than Rs679.4bn ($26bn) in the eight months to mid-September, while daily turnover nearly trebled to Rs3bn. Speculators have concen- trated on shipping and export- oriented blue chips, such as the Birla-owned Century, which has seen its shares rise 50 per cent to Rs7,100 in three months. Great Eastern Ship- ping has doubled to Rs91, and Sesa Goa, an affiliate of IRI of Italy, has trebled to Rs650. A marginal fall in farm pro- duction is forecast for this year, but the estimate is better than expected. Traders had feared a sharp drop this year, expecting a bad monsoon fol- lowing three successive years of good monsoons, but the rains this year have been satis- factory, although less than nor- mal in some areas. There has been no drought. The rupee convertibility promised in three years' time by the new administration is a move to free capital flows to the stock markets and enhance liquidity. Indian companies are the second most profitable among developing countries, after Turkey but ahead of South Korea, Mexico, Thailand and Malaysia, according to a study by the International Finance Corporation. Few foresee a repetition of last October's crash, when markets plunged by more than a third following a surcharge on corporate tax. Mr M.J. Pherwani, for- mer chairman of UTI, the country's largest unit trust, says the market has moved into a new orbit. He is optimistic that the 30-share index will breach the 2,000 mark if the government keeps up the momentum of economic reforms and succeeds in bring- ing down inflation over the next three months. There is at least one cloud on the horizon, however. A surge in new issues, expected late this year and early next, could drain liquidity and break the rally altogether.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES rose yesterday on index-linked buying late in the afternoon, encouraged by the sharp rally in the bond market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 390.66 at 23,968.08, after reach- ing a day's low of 23,536.58 in the morning and a high of 23,978.73 just before the close. Volume rose to 500m shares from 400m as foreigners and institutional investors such as investment trusts traded actively. Gains led losses by 701 to 315, while 123 issues remained unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 17.94 at 1,830.79, and in London trading the ISE/ Nikkei 50 index put on 3.74 to 1,403,42. The fall in bond yields renewed hopes of an imminent interest rate cut. Ms Betty Wu at SBCI said sentiment was positive, although fears over possible bankruptcies of smaller real estate companies still worried some investors. Morning trading concen- trated on the six stocks to be incorporated in the Nikkei 225- issue average from October 1. Sumitomo Heavy Industries climbed Y38 to Y787 and Kumagai Gumi rose Y60 to Y875 in active trading. On the other hand, component stocks to be replaced were heavily sold. Toho, the movie com- pany, fell Y2,000 to Y15,600. Interest rate-sensitive issues were once again popular on prospects of a discount rate cut. Nippon Steel added Y12 at Y424 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries gained Y33 to Y603. Cancer drug-related shares continued to be traded actively. Lion, a leading deter- gent maker, rallied on reports that the company had discov- ered a substance from palm oil that prevents cancer. The issue, however, finished Y5 down at Y860 on profit-taking. Meiji Seika, the confectioner, which has been popular on the development of a new cancer drug, fell Y60 to Y1,310, inves- SOUTH AFRICA FURTHER GAINS by the financial rand kept up pres- sure on Johannesburg shares. The industrial index fell 38 to 4,048 and the all-gold index shed 20 to 1,127 in spite of steady bullion prices. The all- share index lost 35 to 3,340. tors feeling that the issue was becoming too expensive. Speculative stocks suffered sharp falls as rumours that a well-known speculator had gone bankrupt discouraged individuals looking for short-term profits. Kurabo Industries fell Y17 to Y965 and Nippon Carbon plunged Y420 to Y1,330. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, presi- dent of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, speaking before a special committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, said the TSE was investigating the recent volatility in Nippon Carbon's stock price. Nippon Carbon rose sharply from late August on high margin trad- ing, setting a record high of Y2,570 on September 19 - about 2.6 times the price of the shares recorded at the begin- ning of August. Mr Nobuhiko Matsuno, direc- tor general of the Finance Min- istry, told the committee that the ministry had been monitor- ing the stock's price move- ments since late-August. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 260.45 to 26,139.90 in vol- ume of 33.2m shares, down from 35.8m. Shipbuilders, phar- maceuticals and machinery shares gained ground on small- lot buying. Rohm, the integrated circuit maker, advanced Y120 to Y3,140 on reports that pre-tax profits for the current year would rise by 66 per cent to Y13.6bn. Roundup THE REGION's markets mostly followed Tokyo higher, but with varying degrees of enthusiasm. NEW ZEALAND climbed again, with foreign buyers encouraged by a steep decline in the New Zealand dollar and domestic interest rates, in the wake of Wednesday's easing of monetary policy by the coun- try's central bank. The NZSE-40 index closed 37.30, or 2.7 per cent, higher at 1,437.48 after an advance of 1.9 per cent on Wednesday, and turnover expanded again, from NZ$31.8m to NZ$42.7m. AUSTRALIA rose on support for selected stocks, News Corp putting on another 40 cents to A$11 after peaking at A$11.15, a 1991 high, and the newly floated Commonwealth Bank of Australia hitting a new peak of A$6.70 before closing 6 cents up at A$6.66. News Corp has recovered this year from a low point of A$3.19, with overseas markets, notably New York, leading the support for the stock. Com- monwealth Bank was offered for sale late in August at A$5.40 a share. The All Ordinaries index reg- istered a gain of 6.5 at 1,568.5 in turnover up from A$223m to A$237m. HONG KONG staged a tech- nical rebound, the Hang Seng index finishing 26.03 higher at 3,927.98, and turnover picked up from an eight-month low of HK$650m to a still-modest HK$865m. The recovery was also ascribed to hopes of a reduc- tion in interest rates after the close today, and a stop to sell- ing in the properties sector, where Cheung Kong improved 30 cents to HK$20. TAIWAN saw heavy trading as the weighted index rose 51.65 to 4,842.33 on turnover up from T$22.4bn to T$32.5bn. Property issues strengthened following an early news report that the Ministry of Finance would give up its plan to impose a tax on the income from property transactions. But officials from the ministry said later that the government would hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss whether to go ahead with the plan. KUALA LUMPUR's compos- ite index rose 3.62 to 526.70 on further bargain hunting, but MANILA fell in thin trading on profit-taking and margin liqui- dations, the composite index ending 8.36 off at 965.31. JAKARTA went into reverse again after a brief revival on Wednesday. Lack of foreign support was noted as the mar- ket index dipped 3.16 from a revised overnight level of 258.28 on Wednesday to finish at 255.12."

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor FUND managers were beginn- ing to trim down trading operations yesterday in prepa ration for today's rounding-off of share positions ahead of the end of the third quarter of the trading year. An early move by the market above the FT-SE 2,600 mark proved unsupported and by the close the Footsie was nearly five points below this important benchmark. Trading volume, as reported on the Seaq electronic net- work, remained high but trad- ers said the market could make no headway and that business had been selective. The market's trend was largely driven by internal sac- tors, ranging from early sup- port for the FT-SE futures to conflicting hints of the out- come of a poll of political opin- Aooo6600 DOOM Dal 4Sp 18 Sep 30 Oct 14 O-Â« Dgerns: Sep 2 Oct 10 Oct 24 I'M DeMP Sep Oct 11 Oct 25 Oct 7 Oct 21 Nov4 ion, to be published today in a UJK newspaper. Speculative influences remained important, with Hillsdown, Britain's second largest food company, hitting the market early in the day with a rights issue call for Â£280m. However, Barratt Devel- opments, the UK housebuilder 'also in the frame as a potential fund-raiser, left the market untapped afte* confirming that it has suffered a severe loss. Shares in Asda, the troubled food supermarket group which is also marked down for a po- sible rights issue, backed of after Tengelmann, the German food retailer, firmly rejected suggestions in London that it might be interested in the UK company. Equities opened lower after Wall Street's overnight drift downwards but were quickly helped by completion of a trad S ing programme opened on the h previous evening by a leading d UK securities house. g The FT-SE Index touched y 2,608.9 at best but was ther r steadily trimmed back as genu 1- ine investment support melted r away. The final reading put the I index at 2,595.6 for a decline on t the day of 2.2. t Seaq volume totalled 513.4m shares, against 596.2m on Wednesday. Traders believed that the institutions had made an appearance in the market but on a somewhat selective base as they tidied positions ahead of tonight's effective close to the third quarter of the year. The third quarter has seen gains of around 3.8 per cent in UK equities and, with the prog- ress of recovery from the UK recession still in question, fund managers are in no hurry-to disturb their current portfolio balances. Tonight also brings the end of the two-week equity trading account. With both Wall Street and the sterling exchange rate index turning easier as London closed for the day, the final mood in equities was some- what mixed. The blue chip internationals were easier, although oil shares improved against the trend both in Lon- don and New York. Among the domestically ori- entated consumer stocks, share movements were irregular as the institutions backed away from some of the more specula- tive movements of recent ses- sions. Allied-Lyons remained firm, while Bass moved up smartly in thinnish business. Guinness, which has per- formed strongly over the past month, gave up a few pence yesterday, and Kingfisher. the high street retailer, also lacked support at the close of busi- ness. GUS, a volatile stock, turned down. Vodafone, the newly formed cellular tele- phone group which has risen sharply following develop- ments in the US industry, sur- rendered some ground.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Hillsdown Rights Surprise",
   "text_content" : "FOOD, furniture and housebuilding group Hills- down dropped 11 per cent yes- terday after the company sur- prised the market with a one-for-four Â£280m rights issue. The shares finished 29%' lower at 227%p, compared with the rights price of 210p, as 8m changed hands amid sugges tions that some of the institu tional holders had questioned the timing of the fund-raising exercise. There were also suggestions that placing of the new rights shares had not proceeded smoothly, with some of the larger holders said to be taking the opportunity to reduce their holdings. Hillsdown said the additional cash would be used to reduce debts and allow it to make acquisitions. However, there were widespread suggestions that it might also use the funds to boost its existing busi nesses. An analyst commented: \"We are not talking about black holes, but it might be hoping to paper over a few cracks.\" Nerves over Fisons With two bearish stories cir- culating about Fisons, the stock fell in nervous trading. First, a US drug industry publi- cation said there would be a new competitor for the com- pany's iron supplement prod- uct. Fisons argued that it would still dominate this mar- ket. Analysts said that although the market was small, margins were high. Second, a UK journal pub- lished an estimate for sales this year of the company's new asthma drug Tilade. The figure was below Fisons' Â£30m, but that estimate was reconfirmed by the company last night. Fisons partly recovered from an early fall of 11. It ended at 453p for a net decline of 5 fol lowing busy trade. Analysts said the episode showed the market's mistrust of the stock in the wake of disappointing interim results last week. BP hopes British Petroleum stood out in a firm oil sector after a pre sentation by the company to analysts in London. Sugges- tions that BP and Kuwait were holding talks which could lead to BP taking a lead role in rebuilding Kuwait's oil indus- try also drove the share price higher. BP closed 6 ahead at 336p, after 337%p. Turnover came to 8.3m shares. Mr Keith Morris, oil analyst at Carr Kitcat&Aitken and a bull of BP, was impressed by the presentation: \"The com- pany has a clear focus on the total return to shareholders, via dividend return and capital appreciation. It was interesting to note that the directors' remuneration is being geared to total return to sharehold- ers.\" BP adopted a bullish tone on oil price, looking for a fig- ure of around $25 a barrel by 1995, and was said to have again ruled out a rights issue. The market was quick to absorb the opportunities offered by a joint venture between BP and Kuwait. Another oil specialist said it could be a golden opportunity for BP to build on the special relationship that already exists between the two via Kuwait's 9.9 per cent shareholding in the company. RTZ continued to rise with the copper price, which has, in turn, been boosted by unrest in Zaire. The shares climbed 11 to 557p, making a three-day gain of 20. A dispute within the medical profession over the safety of the beta agonist class of asthma treatments continued to undermine Glaxo. The shares slipped for the fourth session in a row to end at 1336p, down 15 on the day. A Far Eastern buyer of Roth- mans in early trading exacer- bated the shortage of stock that has been driving the price higher since an analyst's recommendation on Monday. The shares climbed 29 to 1150p, their second new high in suc- cessive days. Overnight buying of Reuters in New York pushed the stock 29 ahead at one stage. It later eased with the rest of the mar- ket to end a net 17 up at 970p. Turnover in Shell, 5.4m shares, lagged behind that of BP, but the share price turned in an equally strong perfor- mance, closing 6 ahead at 500p. UK broking houses Hoare Govett and Smith New Court gave a big push to Shell, which also saw keen interest from US broking houses. Hoare Govett's oil team described Shell as notably cheap on three counts; against BP; against Royal Dutch, which has responded to aggres- sive US buying; and against the market Smith New Court is keen on both the UK oil majors but has a preference for Shell. Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage, was said to have labelled Shell its \"stock of the decade\". British Gas, which on Wednesday moved to a record 280p, ran into profit-taking and switching into BP and Shell. James Capel was said to have initiated much of the switching. Gas settled 1% easier at 278%p. S.G. Warburg moved up 8 to 549p after being chased higher by Smith New Court. Compos- ite insurance stocks suffered from persistent selling across the board. General Accident, down 11 at 533p, and Royals, 10 weaker at 364p, were the worst affected. National Power dipped 3'% to 166%p and PowerGen 3 to 176p. The regional electricity compa- nies, however, made renewed strong progress with dealers reporting more heavy demand from County NatWest, recent bulls of the sector. Seeboard moved ahead 4 to 219p. Switch- ing between the Footsie and non-Footsie stocks accounted for much of the trading in the water issues. British Aerospace edged up 3 to 428p in an expected response to Wednesday evening's resig- nation of Professor Sir Roland Smith, the chairman. Emrocamp jumped 31 to 294p cancelled its interim dividend. A boost in half-time profits and an optimistic statement from the chairman prompted USM stock Hampden Home- care, the home improvement store operator, to advance 8 to 31p. Chemicals distributor Ellis & Everard declined 5 to 209p after the chairman warned that profits were likely to show a \"modest decline on the back of a flat performance from our mainstream chemi- cals businesses\". Yule Catto, the plantations, chemicals and building prod- ucts company, picked up 9 to 194p after announcing firm first-half profits and a raised dividend. Allied Textiles, one of the second liners to miss out on the textile sector's recent recovery, improved 7 to 426p. Pittard Garnar was 3 firmer at 97p. Recent healthy interim results heralded a strong recovery for the leather com- pany and County NatWest has it on its buy list. United Newspapers bounced after recent weakness as half- time profits at the top of the range of estimates were accom- panied by a confident state- ment. The shares appreciated 14 to 398p.

The Euro Disney park is scheduled to open in April 1992. USM-quoted Regal Hotel was marked 2 lower to 4%p after the company appointed an administrative receiver at a subsidiary, Beacons Hotel. A warning from the chair- man of Dixons, the consumer electronics retailer, that interim profits would be below last year's left the shares 5 off at 247p. Turnover of 5.7m was the second highest this month. Full-year figures, a dividend rise and a confident statement from Frogmore Estates encour- aged steady buying of the stock. The price forged ahead 18 to 337p. Property company Dwyer dropped a further 8 to lOOp - making a three-day fall of 35 - in the wake of a dividend warning earlier in the week. Vickers' first-half results were worse than the market had feared, with the group revealing a Â£4.3m loss for the period. The most pessimistic figure pencilled in beforehand was that the group would break even. The interim dividend was held but the final is now seen to be at risk. The stock retreated 20 to 169p with a hefty 7.2m shares traded. BTR firmed 6 to 414p as investors reviewed the con- glomerate's bid for Hawker Siddeley (up 2 at 752p). USM-quoted Bilston & Battersea fell 6 to 60p after announcing a first-half loss of Â£52,000 against a profit of Â£222,000 at the same time last year.

   "text_content" : "TECHNICAL business domin- ated the Liffe as dealers sought to close their positions ahead of expiry of the Septem- ber Footsie future contract, writes Peter John. The September future remained expensive to the underlying cash market, clos- ing at a premium of 12 against estimated fair value of 6. More significantly, however, the spread between September and December widened sharply to some 55 points. This enabled the arbitrageurs who have been short on September to buy it back and sell the December. One trader said this was likely to ease some of the concern over the large number of positions that could remain open on expiry. At the official close, the Sep- tember was at 2,607, one point off on the day, with 5,935 lots dealt. The December closed at 2,663, a premium of 56 to Sep- tember, against the estimated fair value spread of around 45, with 4,747 lots traded. In the LTOM, turnover of 27,069 lots was once again enlivened by bid speculation surrounding Asda. One broker sold 1,000 October 60 straddles (a combination of calls and puts) at 13p. A further 1,000 straddles were dealt in the British Steel January 130 series and Abbey National saw 1,000 Dec 300 calls sold at 17p.",

   "text_content" : "In the June issue of Software At WorPl we looked at mid-range accounting packages. In the first of our promised follow-ups on the stories of that issue, David Easterbrook, business systems manager for Alfred Dun- hill, the luxury goods retailer, reports back on the installation of the Hoskyns Insight general ledger package, running on IBM AS/ 400 hardware. He writes: \"The implementation of our first-ever standardised international sinan- cial software solution, in five international sites, based on the Hoskyns Insight FMS suite of packages, is proceeding on schedule and we are now half way through our pro- gramme. \"We have just completed our first over- seas implementation in France, going live in July, on schedule, and producing all reports from the AMIS modelling system. These are then sent to London head office, electroni- cally via the IBM network. The implementa- tion was a great success, and has resulted in reduced time in producing the month-end accounts - previously produced manually. Mr Easterbrook adds that the system is scheduled to go live in Singapore and the US by the end of 1991, then Hong Kong in April 1992. The implementation programme started in November 1990, folowing the signing of. contracts. He adds \"Having worked with Hoskyns Insight in designing the new com-. mon chart of accounts, our first major task was to agree it worldwide. This was achieved and implemented in London together with the full suite of Hoskyns Insight FMS packages, on schedule, in April. \"We had a number of teething troubles with the UK implementation, both with Hoskyns Insight and their products. How- ever, we worked together to overcome these, with the French implementation benefiting from all our learning experiences.\" Mr Easterbrook suggests that Hoskyns Insight, \"like ourselves, are clearly climbing a learning curve on this worldwide project. It is a test for their support, both in the UK and overseas.\" Both companies \"are fully committed to ensure the complete success of the Dunhill implementation,\" he says.",

   "text_content" : "ihwn Mr Thoor Saomun, Your correspondent Michael Powel was quite right to say (in the summer issue oa SgWoam at Wi*) that it makes sense to employ consultants to help select software packages. However, he is wrong to assume ihat this will restrict the range of packages or prevent new products gaining accep- tance. At Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte we take every opportunity to cast our net as wide as possible in the search for the software package that best meets our clients' needs. Our approach to assisting clients in selecting package software is based on a thorough understanding of the supplier marketplace: the likely contenders, the qual ity of their products and support services, their track record and future direction and any other factors which may influence the client's decision. The consultants involved in this process refer to information provided by the com- pany's software vendor \"intelligence ser vice,\" but, of necessity, will also map on irst-hand knowledge of the vendor's prod- ucts and services. Whilst the firm has cooperative agree- mants with a limited number of software suppliers, none of these is mutually exdclu sive and under no circumstances would a supplier be omitted from a selection exercise for want of an agreement with the firm. The criteria for shortlisting are, in the main, that the products and support ser vices of a vendor are commensurate with the business needs and technical environ ment of the client. After that, the vendor's success or failure in the sales cycle is entirely dependent upon a demonstrable capability to meet the clients' requirements. During this phase we support our clients by assisting with the weighting and ranking of vendor responses to invitations to tender (ITT's) so that we arrive at a situation where the cient is able to make the final decision.

   "text_content" : "From Mr John Smith. Since the introduction of 'Windows' to the computing world, it would appear that an even wider group of what are known as \"computer illiterate\" business-users will be drawn to these machines. The use of the Windows product will add even further to the benefits of using e-mail, outlined in the article in the sum- mer edition of Software At Work One of the prime advantages for the user is that, when creating messages, he or she will be able to choose between the editor incorporated in the e-mail system itself, or the word processing package (usually more familiar) on the PC. This, will certainly help to make the term office automation\" more acceptable, coupled with the ability to send spread- sheets and database information for other users to read, either on a PC or a main- frame terminal. We at Fischer Systems - part of the Florida-based company, Fischer Interna- tional - are already addressing this mar- ket in Europe with our system EMC2/TAO, running on mainframes, local area net- works and PCs.

   "text_content" : "I HIGHLIGHTS /3 And.the moral of the story is... READERS' enthusiastic responses to the irst issue of Software At Work - in June also brought some bright ideas for future issues. Here, as requested, are some \"nuggets\" gleaned from this issue and signposted so that readers can easily find the tales from which these lessons are drawn. Information Is power The PC database is a boon and a blessing to its users, who can use it for everything from a personal Christmas card list to a complete business model. But it brings problems of control and organisation to the data processing (DP) staff, the garden- ers who have to weed, plant and tend the data for the users to enjoy the blooms. The PC stories in this issue (pages 8-15) illus- trate different approaches to the balance of power between users and DP staff. Taunton trals When Taunton Cider wanted to monitoi the progress of its \"Fraud Squad\" marketing campaign, it turned to personal computers, rather than mainframe technology. The Foxpro database proved to be responsive, and while the company's methods might not impress data processing purists, they have brought results. Taunton Cider was the subject of a new management buy-out in May, 1991 - in which a PC spreadsheet also played a major part. See user report: A pragmatic approach, page 10 Middlesex mnagic The Oncology department at London's Middlesex Hospital now relies on six PCs for its entire patient audit, running the Magic database on a Novell network, to create some critical applications for patient management and audit systems. The system is a pattern of how to make something simple to use for people who \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Fraud Squad: Taunton Cider pulls a fast on are expert in their own field, but too busy to learn how to use a computer. Some of the requirements are brought about by the new NHS requirements, while others are to do with the clinical advantages of hav- ing data in an easily retrievable form: they key of its success has been ease of use. See user report. Two-finger eercise, page 12. Ouardan angl Different users have different database needs, of course. On the other hand, a central data store must be well-audited and controlled by a single database man- agement system. Devon County Council's solution to these opposing arguments seems to be very successful. The informa- tion technology (IT) department, instead of being a grudging guardian and supplier of information becomes a true service-pro- vider, supplying the necessary \"glue\" to hold together the users' disparate require- ments. See user view, page 15. Manufacturing morale Edwards of Enfleld is an engineering busi- ness producing custom-built machines for aluminium extrusion. Alcad manufactures batteries, and ERF is a truck builder in the automotive industry. They appear to be a disparate clutch of companies, apart from their selection for site visits in this issue of Software At Work. But all three had their pre-concep- tions challenged by the introduction of software systems. Where Is the real bott dneck The system at Alcad, the battery manu- facturer, revealed that the real constraints were not in the most complex area of the manufacturing process, where everyone had expected, but in one of the humblest, least skilled stages. Everyone questioned the findings. However, once the system had proved it was right, it was a matter of changing people's views. Previously, the shopfloor workers prided themselves on having a wall of work-in-progress items, piled high waiting to go through the bot- tleneck. Now, it is recognised, to the good of the entire firm, that the smaller the piles, the quicker the flow. See user report pages 2425. rany hands make systems work For Edwards of Enfield, the temptation not to trust the computer system was understandable: their previous experience of computerisation had made them wary. It has taken time and effort to involve everybody concerned in the process of defining the new system, and Edwards has invested heavily in consultancy advice. For Edwards, as at Alcad, training and teamwork has been critical in winning acceptance, and creating a system whose information is not only believable, but a solid basis for Edwards' entire operations. See: User report: Learning the hard way, pages 22-23. Don't blame the system ERF Trucks also had a problem with the lack of trust in a previous system. This resulted in some sceptical testing of the data proffered by the new system. Again, once the system was proven, it was trusted and used to the point where it has been explored to offer services and infor- mation beyond those originally envisaged. \"There were things that were being blamed on the bill of materials' inaccura- cies. Now we had to find some other rea- son for it,\" said Mr David Rothery, ERF's executive data processing manager. His MacPac system now provides each fin- ished truck with its own \"pedigree\": a service no other truck manufacturer can provide. See user report- Trusting the sys- tem, pages 19-20.

Alan Cane emphasises how important it is that individual components are capable of working together to create integrated systems. to improve productivity without sinking beneath a sea of technicali- ties and data processing executives attempt- ing to maintain productivity while keeping a cap on costs. But what faith should computer users place in such promises? The history of soft- ware to date, after all, is a tale of rising costs, missed deadlines, greater complexity and user exasperation. The key to the changes is \"open systems,\" or more correctly \"interoperability,\" an open system of a kind which owes little to manufacturer-inspired campaigns for Open Systems Interconnection or the Unix operat- ing system. For one thing, the new software agenda is being driven by users rather than vendors. For another, it is intensely pragmatic, based on standards which have been proven in use and are broadly accepted by the indus- try. Whether users want \"Open Systems\" or not is debateable; but there is no question that they want interoperability. Interopera- bility means that software packages from different suppliers will work easily together in a single, integrated system. As Robin Bloor points out in 4GLs on Unix*, the problem is that many of the available software components do not work well together \"Whether you consider Lotus 1-2-3, Supercalc or Microsoft Excel to be the best spreadsheet is relatively unimportant. What is important is that you can integrate the product of your choice with your overall computer software configuration. \"You need to be able to treat each pack- age as a component and integrate all the components together\". What has happened in the past few years is that fundamentally the software business has become a components industry. In ear- lier times, customers have tended to acquire a software package, say for accountancy or manufacturing, as a comprehensive whole. All too often, the software tail wagged the corporate dog, as the company bent to fit the package rather than the other way THE software business is changing slowly but pro- soundly in ways which promise computer users lower costs, less complex- ity and greater ease of use. This will be good news both to individual computer users seeking round. Now that strategy is giving way to a more evolutionary approach where the total application is built up from a number of different pieces of software, some bought as proprietary products, others written to order. In this issue of Software at Work, foi example, Philip Manchester describes how ERF Trucks of Sandbach, Cheshire, built its manufacturing system in an evolutionary way around MacPac manufacturing soft ware from Andersen Consulting. Another example in this issue is Edwards of Enfield, a specialist in aluminium extru- sion equipment, which, after a disastrous first foray into manufacturing automation, is now building an integrated set of systems using computer aided design from one man ufacturer, financial software from another and so on. There are many advantages in thie approach, not least the fact that it builds confidence in the staff most intimately con- cerned with control of the system. Kevin Grumball's study of Alcad shows how, once a computer system has won the trust of its users, it can overthrow preconceptions, and dispel long-held beliefs. Staff confronted with a monolithic, inflexible system may have little faith in its output. Once involved in its specification, and able to determine its features, they are more likely to believe its results. The change to a components approach represents probably the most radical shift in the way software is developed and marketed since the beginning of the modern computer era. One superficial sign of the change is the trend towards the \"graphical user interface\" or GUI in software packages. Another is the growing interest in \"client-server\" comput ing, where workstations and larger comput ers are linked together in a network to share the computing load. These developments depend on widely accepted standards which allow users to mix and match computer hardware and soft ware. The GUI, for example, works only if the same images have the same meaning on every computer screen and for every piece of software. The GUI was promoted principally by Apple Computer in the late 1980s as the user interface for its Macintosh range of comput ers. Text commands were replaced by screen images which users intuitively understood. It proved hugely popular with non data processing computer users; Micro- soft, the world's leading personal software house, launched \"Windows\" to give its oper- ating systems the look and feel'of a GUL Apple insisted that software houses devel- oping software for the Macintosh followed the rules of its GUI The consequence is that every Macintosh application has the same look and feel; \"The best set of personal productivity applications in existence\" is how one commentator described the result. Nobody should think that progress towards interoperability will be quick or comprehensive. Hardware and software manufacturers have too much of an invest- ment in proprietary designs for them to show vast enthusiasm for common stan- dards. Among potential GUI standards, for example, are Microsoft's Windows NT, IBM's Presentation Manager, The Open Soft- ware Foundation's Motif running under Unix and DECWindows from Digital Equip- ment. But there are developments which sug- gest that computer users can have faith in an reasonable level of interoperability being reached before long. Object orientation, for example, is a technological development which should speed the interoperability of component software. It is a complex and sometimes disturbing methodology for con- ventional programmers. Programmers' brains have to be turned upside down before they can make the best of the technology, according to Mr Martin Anderson, chairman of Softwright Systems, a specialist in object oriented programming. It does provide, however, a way of writing systems quickly and of re-using programs already written so that the wheel does not have continually to be re-invented. And graphical user interfaces are basic to object orientation. Technology is not everything, however. Successfully pulling together a set of soft- ware components into a single integrated system involves serious consideration of human issues. All the case studies we report emphasise the importance of adequate train- ing; all show how important it is that staff should feel \"ownership\" of their system. The true test of an \"open\" system is the comfort an individual feels in working with it *4GLs on Uni;, Butler Bloor, 1991; Â£420 details on teL 0908 373311.",

   "text_content" : "Claire Gooding demystifies some of the technical jargon associated with PC databases, one of the main topics in this issue of Software At Work. HERE are the technical terms you will encounter in the PC databases section of this survey. These definitions are for read- ers who may not have a technology back- ground. Further glossaries, relating to manufac- turing software and to graphical user interfaces, are included in the relevant sections of this issue: DATABASE, RELATIONAL, SQL A database is a collection of data, organ- ised into files, which can be referenced like a library, by any number of software applications. Before database technology became common, each computer program had its own data attached to it, which made data alterations extremely cumber- some. Most databases today are relational. Ignore the jargon such as \"third normal form\" that comes with this concept. What it means to the user is that files can be combined to select and provide specific information. For instance, to answer the personnel question: \"How many employees over the age of 35 are paid over Â£20,000 a year?\", a relational database would simply collect all the relevant data from various files which can be consolidated (\"related\"), and return the answer. SQL - Standard Query Language - is the lingua fmnca of relational databases. It is used to specify questions such as the request .above, using English-like words and expressions in a specific format. SQL originated with IBM, the world's largest computer company, but has been widely adopted by database suppliers as a gateway between one database (for exam- ple on a PC), and another (for example, the mainframe relational databases IBM's DB/ 2, and Oracle, from the company of the same name). The SQL name is often incorporated into the names of PC database products, to indicate a version which can be used in connection with a mainframe or other resources. RUNTIMB UCENCW DVELOPMNT LICNCC PC databases are often sold in two forms. A development licence is for the use of programmers and developers who need the full facilities to create applica. tions. The applications themselves need the mechanism of the database product in order to run, hence the cheaper, cut-down run-time licence. The runtime licence enables the end user to run the completed application, masking (or removing) the development facilities. For example, with a run-time version end-users can usually make minor adjustments or choices within the applica- tion, without changing anything major: rather like giving the car-owner a set of spanners, but not a torque-wrench. STANDALON1, NETWORK, MULTM-SR, CULIT SURVR First, there were PCs on their own and unconnected, known as standalone. Then they were connected by cables, in a net- work. In contrast, multi-aser systems use a central processor connected to a number of terminals, and multi-user software needs protective mechanisms to prevent simultaneous use of the same data by dif- ferent users. In a network, each workstation or PC, known as a node, does its own processing, although, as in multi-user systems, the PCs might make common use of resources such as printers. Gradually the limitations of PC process- ing power brought about the central \"server.\" This is a central unit, to which networked PCs or workstations are con- nected, which does processing for its dependent nodes or \"clients.\" There are weaknesses and strengths in all these structures. The growth of user-driven PC software (see GUI - graphical user interface, pages 6-7), has made it clear that some things are best performed by the local PClworkstat- ion, whereas others (for instance, process- ing large volumes of data) are better done by central processing servers. In a \"client-server\" network, the edges become blurred, and the work is parcelled up and shared out between the client and the server as appropriate. This is very efficient, flexible and cost-effective approach. But as yet there is little applica- tions software built from scratch to take advantage of co-processing, although a few organisations are experimenting with cli- ent-server networks, (see City stockbroker story, page 14.",

   "text_content" : "Software is destined to follow the trend in hardware towards a component industry. Graphical User Interfaces (GUls) are the first step in this direction. Philip Manchester examines the history of GUIs and the promise they hold for building better applications software. ANYONE who thinks that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are about graphics is mis- taken. GUIs are really about integration. Certainly, GUIs use powerful graphics processing to provide a better way to \"'drive\" computers. But GUIs also provide a standard environment for integrating soft- ware applications which is far richer than traditional operating systems like MS/DOS or Unix. The business benefits of introducing GUIs across a company's applications stem from naking the software appealing and easy to use. Staff who get to know and like the face of their application have no trouble transfer- ring their skills to another application. Even temporary staff, taken on for a week or two, can learn how to navigate around the sys- tem GUIs such as Microsoft's Windows 3 and Apple's Macintosh have changed the face of software applications. But they also alter he infrastructure of systems. They are the irst step towards object-oriented technology - a technology which will change software development methods and established views f applications software. The growing importance of object-ori- ented technology has been underlined this summer by a series of moves from IBM - which until recently had expressed little public interest. In June, at the Objectworld Conference in San Francisco, IBM announced its member- ship of the Object Management Group - a lobbying organisation pledged to spreading standards. Shortly after, IBM announced a ioint development deal with a leading soft- ware company, Borland, to build object-ori- ented software tools. And in July, IBM and Apple made a surprise announcement that they will develop a new generation of object- oriented workstation computers together. The object-oriented approach sees a com- puter system as a set of components which can communicate with each other. The approach brings significant advantages to the production and use of software. Proven software components can be re- used and re-combined relatively easily to create new applications. Object-oriented technology promises to produce cheaper and more flexible software. The GUI is fundamental to the development of object-oriented systems. It provides the mechanisms to create a graphical represen- ations of objects and the standard infra- structure to allow them to communicate. Although first popularised by the Apple as a feature of its Macintosh personal com- puter during the mid-1980s, the GUI only recently broke into the mainstream with the extraordinary success of Microsoft's Win- dows 3. In its first year, Windows 3 sales were over 3m and there are forecasts that more than 7m copies will be sold by the end of 199ndow 3 as attracted swre 3. Windows 3 has attracted software devel- opers, who have built a wide range of appli- cations and many corporations have identi- fied Windows 3 as a key integration technol- ogy for their personal computer systems. Despite its apparent overnight success, however, .Windows 3 is only the latest in a line of products which have struggled to bring the GUI to the desktop. It was pr* ceded by two earlier versions from Microsoft - Windows and Windows 2.0. The original Windows was shipped in 1985 - after a two- year delay in development - and had little impact. Rival US developer Digital Research developed a competitive GUI called GEM. Windows and GEM were, of course, derived from the same research as Apple's Macin- tosh operating system. The real roots of modern GUIs come from Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California, where the essential pioneering work began in the 1970s. Some aspects of the modern GUI can be traced back even further. The mouse pointer, for example, dates from research work by Douglas Engle- bart of the Stanford Research Institute, Cal- WINDOWS 3.0 APPUCATIONS' SALS, 1990 Company and Product Type\" Shipments Rev. rank ($m)* 1.

Although not commercially successful, because of the expensive technology nee- dedd to support it, the Star system was a revolutionary approach to automating office systems. It introduced the socalled desktop meta- phor, the basis of all modem GUIs, into computing. For the first time, data and sys- tem functions were represented graphically in the form of icons. A file of data was represented as a picture of a filing cabinet. A printer was represented as a picture of printer and so on. It is no coincidence that the pioneering work on object-oriented systems was run- ning in parallel at Xerox PARC. The research produced Smalltalk, the first object-oriented software development envi- ronment. Significantly, the Star system integrated many office functions such as wordprocess- ing, database manipulation and electronic mail under a common user interface. The true potential for GUIs became apparent with the launch of Apple's Macintosh in 1984. Apple encouraged third-party software developers to build software to conform to the Macintosh GUI - laying the foundation for a common view of applications and com- mon data exchange. It was also a rich environment for new software. The Macintosh GUI was the foun- dation for most of the innovative applica- tions software to emerge in the late 1980s. These included desktop publishing, image processing, hypertext systems and multime- dia. Without GUIs these applications would have been virtually impossible to create and certainly would not have had the popular appeal of the Macintosh GUL At the same time, Microsoft developed its applications products, the Excel spreadsheet and the Word wordprocessor, on the Macin- tosh. It also pushed on with its Windows development, hoping to create a similar environment for the IBM-compatible per- sonal computer. Microsoft also learnt an important lesson from the Macintosh. Apple's strict rules for developing Macintosh software imposed dis- ciplines on applications builders. But they also paid dividends when it came to integ- rating applications. Data can be moved from one Macintosh program to another with ease because all programs conform to the rules. Microsoft imposed similar rules on developers who wanted to build Windows 3 applications and succeeded in transferring the idea to the mainstream. More important, software tool specialists like Borland have built application develop- ment aids which make it much easier for users to build applications for Windows. It has been notoriously difficult to develop software for GUIs in the past New tools like Borland's Objectvision and Hewlett Pack- ard's New Wave will change this. As a result, users are now able to get their hands on the technology and build their own applications to GUI standards. Many applications are exploiting the bene- fits of object-oriented technology already. All of the software behind a GUI, which handles the display screen, data exchange and switching between windows, is supplied as part of the environment. GUIs also pro- vide standard components for networking, printing and general housekeeping. Users will find an increasingly-rich environment in which to build their applications. They will be able to use proven components and re-use ones they have built themselves. On the surface, the GUI is the \"pretty face\" which will enable the transition to the object-oriented world. But underneath, it is a set of powerful components which will form the foundation of all future software.",

Kevin Gnanball explains the real difference GUIs have made to dealers' daily tasks. DEALING rooms often conjure up pictures of harassed dealers waving their arms and shouting into telephones.

Increasingly it is an area where graphical user-interfaces (GUIs) are making a significant impact. Many dealers' information screens are a clutter of information.

   "text_content" : "A revolution is under way in the area of computer applications software, says Phip Manchester UjF-JJJW.,LC&VWi43a) &)J VVU#JC;, ,)L4YAI GRAPHICAL user interfaces (GUIs) promise to change the whole nature of computer applications software. In place of the traditional approach to the building of applications, GUIs provide a flexible framework in which applications can evolve piece by piece. IBM UK, the giant hardware manufacturer, and UK software company Softwright System set out to demonstrate the potential for this approach in the Vision90 project - and one of the results was a complete reassessment of what a software application is - \"the concept of the monolithic application is dead,\" says Martin Anderson, chairman of Softwright. \"In future, we see applications evolving out of what we call a workplace environment, where the user has access to all of the features to perform the required tasks.\" Vision/90 uses a set of standard components, such as IBWMs OS/2 Presentation Manager GUL; to create a \"workplace\" which is as intuitive to the user as possible. Based on Systems Applications Architecture (SAA), IBM's long-term plan to bring its diverse computer systems together, Vision/90 uses a novel concept called New World Infrastructure, (NWI). In technology terms, this means combining existing operating system software with new techniques like GUIs and object-oriented programming (see page 32). It also means that the systems can be expanded to cover new requirements with ease - especially as they use standard components like OS/2 and IBM's standard networking software. The demonstration system covers two possible \"workplaces\" - one for an insurance application and one for an estate agency. In both cases, real world objects like a policy or a customer, are represented in the \"workplace\" by graphical Icons.\" These icons can be manipulated on the screen to achieve standard business operations. If a customer buys a new insurance policy, the icons for each item can be combined on the screen and the system will prompt for any data which it needs to fulfil the operation. The user 'tirops\" the customer icon on the policy icon. Similarly, if the company wants to create a new policy, this can be done by creating a new icon. This approach to building applications is not without its problems, however. It demands a new way of thinking about how business processes work - \"but there's no doubt that this where it is going. Microsoft's Windows 3 is the catalyst and has uncovered an enormous demand for GUls. When we come out of the recession, I think itll be the way that many companies go,\" says Mr Anderson. Enthusing over the merits of GUls, Mr Ted Walker, financial systems manager at Hoskyns Insight, says:\"Technophobia is no longer an excuse - even at chairman level, since today's systems open up the entire corporate database to anyone smart enough to push a button.\" The new GUI on Hoskyn's Insight's AMIS/ Graphics management and financial information system, pictured right, makes it look like a simple PC package, but it runs on IBM's midrange-to-mainframe AS/400 computers and handles large corporate databases of up to 4.7m items.

   "text_content" : "In this section, Claire Gooding takes a look at PC databases and their users and finds some valuable lessons to pass on. THERE is an inherent problem in PC databases: that of balancing the productiv- ity gains made by individual PC users with the need to control the data they use. The data is a precious corporate resource, and few companies are entirely happy with the balance they achieve between the main- frame, for sheer processing power, and the PC, as a user-friendly \"front-end\", to manip- ulate and report on the data, but with lim- ited powers to process large amounts of data. In an attempt to find an elegant solution to the estrangement of the PC from corpo- rate mainframes, products such as Oracle, Focus, and SAS, primarily identified with the mainframe market, have spawned PC versions. Large user organisations are looking closely at these as a way of preventing fragmentation of corporate data and staff skills alike, but end-users still tend to favour the friendlier specialist PC databases, which they see as a route to independence. Recently there has been a shake-up in the PC database market. Borland, producer of of a range of PC software including its own database Paradox, swallowed up Ashton Tate, whose dBase 1 database blazed the trail for PC databases at the start of the 1980s. (The current version, dBase IV, has lost out to more recent window-oriented products, but is still claimed to be the sec- ond most popular development language next to Cobol). Software Publishing, the US firm which owns Harvard Graphics software, recently bought Precision Software, UK developer of the Superbase 2 and 4, \"client-server\" data- base products. Client-server is a new type of technology now emerging to keep the bal- ance between the two camps of PC and mainframe. The \"client\" is the PC, who is able to tap into the \"server,\" a central computer whose job is to store the bulk of data and aid with processing. In talking to many users of the various leading database products, Software At Work has found several examples of cli- ent-server solutions alongside more conven- tional use of well-established names, such as dBase, Paradox, and Nantucket's Clipper. The Gartner Group, the software industry observer, has identified a trend towards run ning personal database applications against servers, particularly in departmental solu- tions. \"In the future, we'd anticipate that many companies will split processing between the PC or integrated workstation, and the cen- tral mainframe,\" comments Mr Peter Sonde- gaard, PC analyst and European programme director for Gartner. \"None of the current PC database vendors enable users to move forward into client- server, using their software alone, although products such as Gupta's SQL-Windows offer a mechanism. \"We believe that most of the popular data- bases, such as Paradox, dBase, and Dataease, will evolve into 'front ends' serv- ing larger mills in the background. Not all those evolutions will be successful, and oth- ers are already developing tools to com- pete.\" There is, he points out, some critical data already kept on PC databases - \"the single, unconnected PC is a dead-end. The PC solved personal productivity, but now we need a fully connected environment: appli- cations will have to be re-written to support that environment.\" Mr Robin Bloor, another industry watcher, of consultancy Butler Bloor, recently undertook a survey of PC data- bases. He sees the PC as a personal tool with not enough processing power to cope with all the demand made upon it. \"The PC starts as an enabler, than becomes a constraint. Problems stem from solutions - and the main problem is one of fragmentation.\" The fragmentation, he points out, extends towards skills as well as the actual data. A \"need it now\" application done quickly on a PC can become critical, but this is unlikely to change, since large corporations and local or small departrents of the body will always have disparate needs. Mr Bloor predicts that software vendors will develop in two directions to bridge the gap - \"vendors already do a lot for the user with the screen interface, but they are nowhere near exploiting graphical inter- faces as they can be exploited.\" The trend towards \"downsizing\" - shrinking applications once limited to large machines to run on smaller systems, partic- ularly PCs - has raised questions of how to share the data. Mr Stephen Arnold is man- aging director of consultancy Softa & Co, a systems consultancy specialising in distrib- uted database systems and PC databases, with clients such as Rover and John Lewis. \"Technology has moved on,\" says Mr Arnold. \"People are having to consider distributing data, and integrating PCs into their overall strategy.\" He considers that most of the traditional consultancies under-estimate the greater value for money and higher productivity that can be achieved through PC databases. He uses the example of serving the sales force in the field with applications running on portable computers.* A number of Softa clients are now using at PC databases, moving development from mainframes down to a combination of large database engines (the mainframe) and the PC \"front end\" (the part the user sees and uses). This, according to Mr Arnold, brings a whole host of business and technical bene- fits. \"Management philosophy is changing as well People are looking to cut out the mid- dle management and distribute information to where it is most needed. Ten years ago, minis and mainframes would have been the only route, but now PCs are cheaper, the software is available, and it's all coming together at same time.\" Mr Arnold divides PC databases into what he calls \"character-based\" systems and \"window-based\" systems. The character- based systems include dBase, Clipper, PC Oracle, Ingres, Paradox and Dataease, among others, and use keyboard entry, Stephen Arnold: highlighting new advantages inviting users to select options from a screen-based menu. The windows-based products are \"ergon- omically designed and proven over some years to be the most effective user inter- face,\" according to Mr Arnold: like Mr Bloor, he sees the windows route to which Softa is now committed, as the future plat- form for development. He identifies the two main Windows play- ers as Microsoft's Visual Basic, under Win- dows 3 and Superbase 4, receritly acquired by Software Publishing. The main problem in spreading this phi- losophy, he says, is the lack of understand- ing amongst users about the implications of data distribution and its potential, particu- larly at director level and board level. \"People either do nothing, or feel slaves to the DP department, because their confi- dence is undermined about making what they see as a risky investment. In reality, it's an essential investment, because if you use information technology (IT) correctly, it should be an integral part of the business strategy, increasing your profitability. If you don't understand it, it can become an obsta- cle, even a drag on profitability. \"There is still not enough understanding about using IT in business at the board level.\" In his opinion, the business commu- nity \"can't re-train and gear up quickly enough to make use of the benefits of new technology.\" *The nart issue of 'Software at WBor' will be looking at sales and marketing systems as a major pic see Page 4for more details.",

   "text_content" : "Corporations that try to impose a grand strategy on PC users will always be resisted, says Kevin Grumball MOST large companies would like to have a grand strategy for their high technology operations. Many managers make bold statements like: \"We will standardise on Unix.\" But all are doomed to fail - the PC undermines all grand corporate strategies because of its versatility. Corporate computing strategies invariably originate in one of two places: the board- room or the data processing (DP) depart- ment. None ever originate among the users of the systems. Thus, like all policies dropped from on high, they will be observed when convenient and ignored when not. There will be no real commitment among the everyday users of the systems. The PC has taken computing out of the realm of high capital expenditure down to departmental budgeting. It needs no special rooms, no costly air-conditioning, no com- plex power supplies. A low-end personal computer appears to cost little more than an electric typewriter. As a result, the individual departments may buy PCs as they please. Likewise, soft- ware is relatively inexpensive (or even free) and will be chosen to fit individual needs. Most strategies imposed from above founder because they run contrary to the perceived needs of the departments. Some companies choose to standardlee on a single PC product for each class of software. So, there will be a standard word-processor, spreadsheet, database and so on.. A corporate decision to use a single spreadsheet may involve the company buy- ing hundreds of copies. Many (if not most) of these become \"shelfware\" and sit in their shrink-wrapped packages forever. People will subvert the system when they feel it inhibits them from doing their job. The most pernicious subverter of strate- gies of this kind is the \"brother-in-law\". Many people are running software on their PC which they obtained from their \"broth- er-in-law.\" The fictional relative might be the person at the next desk or the next department; the software may even have been \"downloaded\" from an electronic bulletin board. Software is easy to copy and good packages spread more by this sort of passage than by any cincerted marketing effort. It is, of course, illegal to copy commercial packages. It is also the main route of entry for computer viruses. Some companies have responded by send-- ing round audit forms on which staff record all the software that they are using. This is then talled-up centraly and the software companies get their due. This solves the legal isse, but does not address the prob- lnea of inompatibility. Companies that have no strategy at all 1m the quagmire of inrAmpathile systems. Ntwo dnga hes ofteB heenr touted as the MS5T! Not A BrT OP DrSIrte SFIlFA AT TE k ffT PRCE? saviour but it is by no means rare to find large companies with two or more incom- patible networks. Even if two computers can exchange files over the network, this does not guarantee that the data in those files is interchange- able. There are many published standards for data interchange in the PC world. Some packages may support a number of them but there are cases where two packages support two or three different formats each but have no format in common. So, what are the successful elements that any gand strategy must incorporate? 0 Firstly, expect that the system will be subverted. Any central buying policy will founder because shareware (cheap or fee software that may be copied eely) will undermine it. Recognise that staff will obtain the software hat tey feel hey need, by one mens or another. * Ensure that whatever standard is cho- sen, it relates to interchange of data, rather than specific packages. It is relatively easy to insist that any package must support a common interchange format. Most people will recognise the need for this and will largely adhere to it. Any PC strategy should at least specify a standard interchange for- mat for word processing documents, spread- sheets and databases, as a minimum. * Conduct regular audits of the software in use. There are standard forms available from organisations such as the Federation Against Software Theft, (FAST). This removes the threat of legal action. It also shows what software people actually use. With a few extra questions you should also elicit what the packages are used for. This may uncover hidden troves of useful infor- mation. * Insist that only packaged software or software, checked by a virus scanner, may be used on company machines. If shareware software is used, ensure that it is properly obtained and paid for. Downloading soft- ware (via a modem) from well-known bulle- tin boards is relatively safe. Bulletin boards form a useful reservoir of software and the respectable ones all have rigorous virus- checking. People will do it anyway, so it is better to have a policy to control it. * Encourage staff to review software critically and to share their experiences with different packages. This can save a lot of wasted staff time as individuals each try and evaluate different packages. A newslet- ter with back copies filed in order can pro- vide regular feedback, fuelled by regular meetings with one member of a group pres- enting the virtues of a particular package. These methods will encourage the use of a small (thus controllable) number of pack- ages far more than any company dictat. * Enjoy the benefts that the personal computer brings - incraseed computer lt- eracy and a willingness to chanmge.",

   "text_content" : "In a move to streamline its marketing operations, a West Country brewer has abandoned mainframe computer techniques in favour of a PC database. Claire Gooding reports. WHEN the spoof \"Fraud Squad\" adverts for Red Rock Cider appear on TV screens in Britain, there is no mention of the product's maker. The same goes for the cinema screen \"Diamond White\" commercials and the good-day, bad-day Dry Blackthorn scenes. No company logo or any other credit hints that these are all products of the traditional West Country company, Taunton Cider. This is quite deliberate, as is the resem- blance to baffling lager adverts. For here lies the real thrust of Taunton Cider's ambi- tions, not in competing with other cider- makers such as Bulmer. It is attempting to change the image of cider and cider-drink- ing quite a brief for a company whose man- agement buyout made it a small indepen- dent among giants as recently as May 1991. The self-effacement in the high-profile, high-spending marketing campaign is one aspect of a dichotomy which permeates the whole company. The old rubs shoulders with the new throughout the 20-acre site outside Taunton which includes a 200-year-old house. Tour- ists are shown the water-gullies through which the piles of apples are washed, as in olden days. Towering oak vats (some a hun- dred years old), are enclosed in a shed next to modem stainless steel towers. The tubes of fibre-optic cables winding between the vats and towers are hardly noticeable, but Taunton Cider is above all a pragmatic company, and uses the old with the new whatever best answers its purposes. This is most remarkable in its attitude to Information Technology, (IT) where the \"strategic\" decisions have been overthrown by the practicalities of using PCs in manage- ment and marketing. For the direction of its critical marketing campaign, and for infor- mation on its effect, the company relies on a small PC database, not on the ICL main- frame technology which it has built up over the years. The actual cider-making process has changed little with the introduction of tech- nology, apart perhaps from the volumes now bottled and distributed. The quality and consistency of the products is still the responsibility of two expert cider-makers who alone taste, blend and dictate the for- mula. The process has more in common with wine-making than brewing. For three months from September every year, the employees' car park becomes a giant \"apple- park.\" The fruit is pulped and fermented (cattle cake is a by-product), using tradi- tional methods. Excess juice is reduced to concentrated form by the local Milk Market- ing Board, and stored so that the cider-mak- ing can continue all year round. Taunton Cider makes use of technology wherever it aids efficiency, both in automat- ing the process and in bottling and distribu- tion; the latter areas are where the com- pany's new products have created most Mountains of anoles await DulDna and fermentation by traditional methods problems. Its product hardly fits the traditional mould of manufacturing though it uses some aspects of \"Just In Time\" methodol- ogy, to control inventory. Order-taking and despatch are computerised, and information technology (IT) generally enjoys a high pro- file: it makes an early entrance in the com- pany video, not far behind the apples them- selves. Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM), is an item on the \"wish list.\" The management and particularly the marketing drive of the company is where its technology has really made a difference. \"Information technology can give a competi- tive edge, but it's short-lived, you can't stand still\" says Mr Alan Smith, the man- agement services manager. His own focus is on business benefits, especially with the marketing system. \"As a drinks company, we need to break out of the \"cider box\", which gives cider a fixed image and position. We're aiming at the under-25 youth market, with products like Diamond White for 18-25s, but also we're broadening the traditional product- line so they can take their cider habit with them as they mature.\" The system which tracks the progress of the marketing cam- pagn is - surprisingly for such a critical application - written on PC in the Foxpro database. For some years, Taunton Cider has been building a database which has enabled its directors to analyse sales in detail. Initially it used mainframe systems: four years ago Taunton Cider made a com- mitment to follow the mainframe route to responsiveness and productivity. Its tools included ICL's IDMS database and Fourth Generation Language (4GL), Quickbuild, which promises gains in programmer-pro- ductivity and the accessibility of data. But having taken this mainframe route, Taun- ton did not hesitate to abandon it when it failed to produce the desired results. Capitulation came with the infiltration of PCs which proved more adaptable, attrac- tive and easy to use. \"My view is that IT's contribution should not be restricted by technical issues,\" comments Mr Smith, who joined the company three years ago. \"It's easy to spend millions on computerisation, but what really matters is a close alliance with what the business has to do. If some- thing doesn't work, we change direction. \"Even if the current direction is not ideal, it's getting us somewhere. You need an adventurous attitude based on results, or IT becomes merely a sideline of finance. We must be able to move fast on our feet, faster than the competition, to find out who's drinking which cider, and where.\" Foxpro was the PC database chosen to produce quicker, cheaper and more adapt- able information. According to Mr Smith, Continued on facing page Continued from previous page Foxpro \"chose itself\" . \"What we wanted was a single language which transcended mainframes and micros, hence the data- base route.\" Foxpro applications, written for 50 users on a Novell PC network, have formed the basis of the system, known as \"Oracle\" in-house. The Oracle applications are so fundamental to Taunton Cider's marketing that it is cagey about releasing much detail. Mr Andrew Nash, commercial director, explains the reason for his reticence: \"Over five years we have made a substan- tial investment of time, money and resources with major brewers and whole- salers, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\" The system started with sales analysis and spread to purchase order manage- ment, spawning other applications which have infiltrated various departments, deal ing with the tracking of purchases, cash commitment, and statistics. Broadly, Oracle tracks the performance of various ciders and their sales outlets, providing Taunton Cider with the basis of a detailed sales and marketing strategy. One result of this information has been the recent re-alignment of the sales force to deal with key customers such as Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda, Bass, Courage, Whit bread and Grand Met. Another use has been the careful tracking of the effect of the \"Fraud Sqaud\" and other campaigns. John Laidlaw, marketing manager, explains further: \"The Oracle systems gives us a readily accessible form of infor- mation to assess broad performance. We get weekly reports on actual sales against target, and we can call up 13 TV regions, and a map of distribution, showing brand, strength, and any changes susequent to advertising. It's a very useful tool, and very flexible. For intance, if we do a test, we can look at the results by TV region.\" Files are easily transmitted along the network using \"comma delimited\" (ASCII) format, which also enables the system to absorb outside information, including mar- ket statistics bought in from an outside research firm. The PC approach proved itself further at the management buyout in May 1991. (The buyout was triggered by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which has had a profound effect on breweries and their pubs.) The effort to find backing depended not on mainframe information, but on a model built entirely on a PC. The model was built in a combination of Supercalc and Lotus 1-2-3. Taunton was a Supercalc user, but as the banks and other investors were largely Lotus 1-2-3 users, the company con- verted its files as needed. This model still represents the entire activities of the company. Financial direc- tor Mr Nick Pearch relies on the 10-year model, which shows working capital, profit and loss, balance sheet, and all other aspects of financial information. \"It was an integrated model - 'the Bible' for the buyout,\" comments Mr Pearch. Before the buyout, the model was \"lent\" in floppy disk form, to Morgan Grenfell and circu- lated among potential investors. It played a key part in convincing them of the com- pany's potential performance. But the PC's very flexibility can make it vulnerable - \"we now need controls and checks to make this a corporate resource\" added Mr Pearch. \"At the stage of the buvout, it could not be set in concrete, and key things changed every day. Now the buvout is completed, we have a different et of priorities.\" Realising that a key information asset should not be too easy to change, nor esident on a sole PC, Mr Smith is in the reocess of \"setting the model in concrete\" n an Excel spreadsheet. He is looking for even more flexibility which will allow its users to add detail, turn the model upside-down if need be, view data from different angles, and examine the effect of 'what if\" factors, such as a change of product mix. It has become, in effect, cor- porate data, and must be made safe from he very fluidity which made it useful as a tool to sell the management buyout. Mr Smith has achieved wholehearted support for his PC solutions, assisted per- haps by the youth of some of the new board members. They are enthusiastic about the benefits of using PCs particu- rnlv ini arnhlj' inl rn' amutfinn Iona\\ oi looking at combining the information held in the spreadsheet model and the Foxpro database into an easily-presented execu- tive information system (EIS). Several of the board are already PC- aware and PC-users. \"We are aware of the gradual eclipse of the mainframe,\" says Mr Nash. He and Mr Pearch are both regular and enthusiastic users of a product called VideoShow, which runs software called Picturelt, enabling them to create presen- tation very swiftly. \"The other night, I put a presentation together by myself, in half an hour, after the secretary had gone home,\" says Mr Nash. Both Mr Nash and Mr Smith suggest that the secret of mak- ing PCs acceptable, even attractive, is ease-of-use. They agree that if a director can use the system, then anyone can. Interestingly, everyone admits to the dif- ficulties and dangers inherent in addictive use of PCs - \"the 'plus' is productivity and speed-of-result,\" comments Mr Dave Harris, operations manager. \"A potential danger is that lack of integration can be a problem, but it is still a cheap way of delivering productivity.\"",

   "text_content" : "* Supplier: Ashton-Tate, the US-based database developer, was founded in 1978. It was recently taken over by Borland Interna- tional, a rival database company. * Product: dBase IV 1.1 from Ashton-Tate (UK) is a relational database with a fourth genera- tion language. More than 3m copies are installed worldwide, based on units sold. * Features: Control Centre-flexible access to: Forms Designer for data entry screens; Report Designer for detailed columnar or multi-lined reports and labels; Query Designer for user- defined information access; Application Designer for creating menus for users' spe- cific applications. * Hardware hosts: dBase IV is available on IBM PC, VAX/VMS, SUN/UNIX, 386/UNIX; Inter- active UNIX; Apple Macintosh. Versions in development DEC Ultrix, HP, IBM AIX. * Connectivity: dBase data files, indexes and programs are all portable across platforms without modification or recompilation; dBase IV Server Edition has SQL connectivity to Microsoft SQL Server. Products in develop- ment will support connectivity to Oracle, IBM OS/2 Extended Edition and Sybase. Other products allow connectivity to host mainframe databases through terminal emula- tion. * Sales and support: Ashton-Tate sells through three main distributors who supply dealers. * Pricing: dBase IV standard edition, Â£650; developer's edition, Â£995; LAN Pack (allowing five extra users), Â£995. All products are upgraded on a regular basis. * USER VIEW: SHELL UK SHELL UK's manufacturing complex in Ellesmere Port deals with the distribution of oils and chemicals. There are around 750 PCs throughout Ellesmere Port, using around 40 licences for Ashton Tate's dBase IV database. Shell is a long-time user of Ashton-Tate products, having previously used versions II and IfI of dBase. The applications were all small depart- mental ones initially; non-critical except to their users. The dBase software was used to build small programs such as those for catering administration, recipes and costs. Now there are a growing number of users, with dBase spreading to seven or eight departments. It is now used for more critical applications such as recording and producing graphical reports on non-confor- mant systems. Virtually all the applica- tions accept data only through the key- board, not from other systems elsewhere. Other PC applications, mostly spread- sheets or those written in the PC Focus end-user programming language, do feed information up again to the mainframe. In the case of the the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, the dBase IV software is used as a \"staging post\" between the PC and the mainframe. According to Mr John Falconer, busi- ness systems analyst at Shell, the inter- change of data is \"a bit of a fiddle,\" involv- ing terminal emulation and PC utilities between the mainframe and the PCS. The dBase applications are supported by the Shell help desk, and developed by Mr Falconer's five-strong team of analysts, including two dBase specialist program- mers. Mr Falconer estimates that major applications take between six and eight weeks to develop: at a cost of around Â£1,000 per man-week, this means a cost per system of Â£6,000-Â£8,000. \"The benefits are harder to quantify\" explains Mr Falconer. \"The conformance applications are vital, but for the most part the applications aid administration. That means that they amount to \"added value\": in the \"nice-to-have\" category rather than being the lifeblood of the com- pany.\" While recognising dB ase IV as a power- ful tool, for the strategic applications, Shell is looking more towards Focus for applications using multiple updates, partly because it is already resident on the main- frame. There are a few PC \"dissidents\" using Foxpro as an alternative database, but generally dBase is accepted as the recom- mended PC database solution within Shell.",

The company was previously owned by Bass, Courage, and Scottish and Newcastle. Taunton Cider was the subject of a management buyout in May 1991 in which 98 per cent of employees participated. The buyout was initially financed by bankers Samuel Montagu, with the equity underwritten by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital. The management holds 15 per cent of shares. Taunton Cider is concentrating on its newer brand name products, Diamond White, Diamond Blush, and has shown a plus 8.4 per cent growth year on year, compared with 5.5 per cent for other cider makers. In July, the company recorded its highest-ever market share, showing over 35 per cent of the total cider market, on and off trade. The ambition of the management team is to float the company on the Stock Exchange. * Key personnel: Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman; Mr Peter Adams, chief executive; Mr Andy Nash, commercial director; Mr Nick Pearch, finance director; Mr Alan Smith, management services manager. * Turnover: 1990-91, including excise duty, Â£125m, (1989: Â£75m with profits of Â£8.8m). * Employees: 500. TECHNOLOGY FILE * Computer hardware: ICL mainframe, dual Series 3935, running IDMS database, plus 90 PCs, (70 Apricot computers, 20 Toshiba portables) on a Novell network. * Software: PC Database; Foxpro,(network development licence), used to create a sales and marketing system (known in-house as \"Oracle\" - nothing to do with the database product of same name). The system monitors brand performance, market share analysis and other market factors. Also Supercalc spreadsheet, used to model management buyout (now transferring to Excel), and Picturelt for creating presentation graphics. * Cost of PC database system: The Oracle system cost around Â£15,000 to develop in Foxpro, including consultancy, with ongoing support costs of Â£2,000. The database product Foxpro cost Taunton less than Â£1,000, and is now being used for other things. Total IT spend represents about 1.5 per cent of turnover (including salaries, management, comms, training, fibre optic cable installation).",

MSE UK was established in 1990. * Product: Magic is an application generator and computer-aided programming tool with an integrated database. It was first released in 1985 and has now sold 65,000 licences in 25 countries. Of these, 15,000 are development module licences and 50,000 run-time (for end-users). Multi-user systems are counted according to the number of users. UK licences currently number 500. * Hardware hosts: Magic is available for any MS/DOS 3.1 compatible network, Novell's Net- Ware, OS/2 standard edition, version 1.2, and Unisys BTOS/CTOS, Digital Equipment Corpo- ration's VAXNMS and Santa Cruz Operation's (SCO) Unix V environments, with full applica- tion portability. * Connectivity: Magic II allows users and developers to take advantage of client/server facilities and download data from mainframe and minicomputers on to standalone or net- worked PCs. Magic II is compatible with DEC- NET and TCP/IP protocols and uses Novell Netware's Btrieve. * Sales and support: sales are made through MSE UK's network of resellers who develop applications with the product and sell run-time and development licences. Magic allows the applications to be developed in conjunction with end-users. The central sales, support and training services are provided from MSE UK's Wembley office, which works closely with executives and developers in Israel. * Pricing: for the 'development system ranges from: Â£695 to Â£995 for MS/DOS; Â£1,945 for OS/ 2, Â£3,795 for Unisys BTOS/CTOS; Â£3,300 for SCO Unix and DEC VAX/VMS. Upgrades, new versions and updates are han- dled on the basis of standard maintenance agreements for users in the DEC, Unix and Unisys environments. * USER VIEWs Hewlett Packard COMPUTER manufacturer Hewlett Pack- ard (HP) has at least 500 PCs throughout its Bracknell headquarters in the UK. The company originally purchased the Magic database for reporting applications, and now holds two development licences and around a dozen runtime licences, which allow end-users to run the Magic applica- tions. At the time, the company was re-organ- ising, and needed a quick and easy method of reporting. This exercise demanded the merging of data from two sources - one of them being the European headquarters in Geneva. This was delivered to Magic in the form of a print-file, which was fed in from a PC network, having originated on Geneva's HP 3000 minicomputer. The next system to be developed was a management tool to help track the prog- ress and actions on software support con- tracts. The system tracked contact with customers, and flagged actions: another requirement arising from the re-organisa- tion, specifically as part of a 'quality cir- cle' assessment project. \"We designed a database and two screens ridiculously fast,\" comments Mr David Savoca, HP's information analyst. \"I sat down with the representative of the quality circle and - as she told me their requirements - I almost used Magic as a way of documenting them as she spoke. \"The resulting support system went out as a full application to eight districts on PCs. \"Magic is no toy. You can build power- ful applications with it, and I have yet to find something I cannot do,\" he adds. \"It certainly gave the business managers the view they needed of the new organisa- tion, which has been refined over six months. For Â£2,500, and out of five days effort, we have a system, where traditional tools would probably have taken a month of time and effort. \"My job is management and delivery, not building systems: Magic gives me the time to do that' Even so, Mr Savoca regards the Magic reporting applications as a stop-gap, strictly a \"report only\" database, which feeds no other applications. It has effectively been a prototyping tool for a systems which will reside on the HP 3000 within the next eight months.",

   "text_content" : "Managing directors who are under time-pressure and can only type with two fingers have more in common with doctors than they might expect. The success of Middlesex Hospital's PC database has been its ease-of-use and foolproof protection of life-and-death data, reports Claire Gooding. Doctors learn to navigate around the new PC database system \"In five or ten minutes,\" says Professor Robert Souhaml. THE ONCOLOGY department at central London's Middlesex Hospital deals with 120 admissions per month, under one senior house officer and a registrar. The unit deal- ing with osteosarcoma - a form of bone cancer - used 1,448 bed-days in a year. Middlesex is probably unique: not for that volume of throughput, but for being able to pinpoint it so easily. \"I am the only person in the whole hospi- tal who can supply such accurate informa- tion,\" says Professor Robert Souhami, who initiated a PC-based system, known as Opmas, for the Oncology Patient-Manage- ment and Audit System, 18 months ago. For around Â£12,000, (the cost includes the help of a consultant, but excludes hard- ware), he has created a powerful system using a PC database, known as Magic. Opmas' ease of use hides a sophisticated recording system which saves senior house officers (SHOs) hours of work, and gives detailed statistics at the touch - literally - of two keys. Doctors learn to navigate around the sys- tem \"in five or ten minutes,\" according to Prof Souhami. The staff turnover in a teach- ing hospital of Middlesex' status is rapid: roughly every three months. Medical staff who are new to the department have plenty to learn without having to grapple with computers. \"I know nothing about computers, I had never used one, and I still find pen-and-pa- per easier,\" states Prof Souhami. \"That is why I was exactly the right person to design this system. I know the weak link is with the doctors. If the SHO doesn't want to use the system, you might as well throw it all away.\" He designed the system by the simple process of hand-drawing screen outputs, which he says took only a few hours of his time. The doctors who use Opmas can look up or print out individual treatment records of patients (a useful facility in a crisis when notes are not immediately at hand), search records by patient name, consultant, diagno- sis, or any other relevant factor. The system not only supplies information about drug doses, ful blood counts, and other details relevant to the chemotherapy work under- taken at the oncology department. The system also supplies automatic phar- macy charts for the drugs required, and generates automatic letters of discharge to the patient's general practitioner, saving valuable hours for the SHOs, who have no secretarial help with the drudgery imposed by these these necessary formalities. Previously, it was a problem to keep track of patients, some on repetitie high dosages of drugs, umdeg ong a series ct cumulative chemotherapy sessions. The system has been a great success, because it is easy to use, and the doctors have two powerful incentives to use it: saving time, and gain- ing access to vital information. Opmas has proved so effective that it is now the depart- ment's only route for pharmaceutical pre- scriptions. Prof. Souhami, chief architect of the sys- tem, demonstrates its finer points with the minimum of dexterity. He uses two fingers, one for each of the function keys, and makes liberal use of pre-defined lists of data. These ensure that names, treatments and other data is consistent and valid, guarding against the mis-spelling of a consultant's name, or a wrong treatment code. Opmas itself presents more vital errors: many of the values are worked out automatically, such as prescription doses, worked out from patient's bodyweight. The Department of Health has always requested details on bed-stay and other sta- tistical information, but most of what is submitted is a mixture of guesswork and estimates, according to Prof. Souhami. The need for accurate facts and figures is made more urgent by the changes in the NHS, which involve contracting-out and cross- charging for services, for which accurate information is a pre-requisite. In catering for his own specialist require- ments, Prof Souhami has unwittingly cre- ated a system of instant commercial value. Over a hundred hospitals and cancer units in the UK could benefit from Opmas. Furthermore, the flexibility and speed of the Magic database makes it adaptable to almost any clinical specialist treatment, such as diabetes or Aids. One pharmaceutical company has already shown interest in providing the system to users of its drug treatment, since Opmas provides a demonstrable comparison of bed- stay rates with, and without the drug. The Oncology department at London's Middlesex Hospital now relies on six PCs for its entire patient audit, running the Magic database on a Novell network. The department paid for the development of the system itself, and it will benefit from any income. Prof Soubami has already dis- cussed commercial marketing, support and pricing (between Â£10,000 and Â£12,000) with the consultant who designed the system from his specification. The oncology unit is in any case an inde- pendent unit, and bought its six PCs with no central controls imposed on it as to choice of development environment. \"I approached the hospital with a descrip- tion of what I wanted, and the computer people understood but offered no hope of doing it,\" epltains Prof SouhamL \"Origi- nally I wanted to link the system in to our existing Patient Administration System, but there was no hope. They couldn't have done it.\" The area health authority is itself PC- aware, and understands the difficulties faced by smaller departments whose requirements often come low on the list of DP developments, so Prof. Souhami was able to spend his budget as he wished, on Compaq PCs and consultancy advice. The applications were built not by the oncology department itself but by a consul- tant specialising in Magic development, Mr Jeremy Cummin of Eider Computers. He selected Magic as the development database after evaluating it along with Oracle, Omnis, dBase, and other PC products. In developing the main patient manage- ment and audit systems, Mr Cummin has used the full scope of reporting facilities, and taken full advantage of them in devel- oping further management and audit func- tions. The system has been gradually refined over the last 18 months. Improvements have concentrated on making existing features easier to use, fail-safe, or more efficient, such as cutting down the time for one par- ticular audit report from two-and-a-half hours to three minutes. Mr Cummin claims to have an unconven- tional approach to coding - \"I take the view the clients know what they want.\" He first gets them to design their own reports and screen layouts, in hand-written manuscript form - not a computer in sight. '\"This really works,\" he comments. \"It gives them the chance to go through and discuss it, and it's only then we turn it into a useable specification, coded as mutually agreed.\" Prof Souhami's hand-sketched screens proved remarkably comprehensive. Mr Cummin describes installation of the Magic software as \"trivial\" - there were no links to existing hardware. The applications use direct keyboard-input only, but they information they produce goes out to other local systems on floppy discs. It takes only five minutes to enter the initial registration details for a patient, even for an unpractised user with no keyboard skills. One of the advantages of Magic was its ability to sort and select within extremely long lists, at speed - \"It is able to select a specific treatment record from a base of 50,000 or more, almost instantaneously,\" reports Mr Cummin. He believes the system has given the oncology department a useable system, very swiftly, and at minimal cost - \"you can't put values on people's lives or the length of a hospital stay.\"",

Overseas users found it too difficult to access data held back at the head office, so they were provided with a management information system with the internal name of Navigator. Navigator itself takes in data from other BA systems on marketing, security, competitors, and sales. The mainframe applications are built around APL and Focus. Several bespoke systems have grown out of the system as a by-product, based on a subset of the data in the Navigator system. On its DOS-based PCs, BA uses Ashton Tate's dBase as well as Superbase 4. BA provides an \"Office Automation Centre\" which assesses business requirements, and then evaluates market offerings: all products have to fit the long-term strategy. Superbase 4's utilities make it easy to exchange the data between dBase, Lotus 123 and Excel spreadsheets, text and ASCII files. Other facilities give BA access to outside applications, and the ability to put data into word processing applications. The original source of the data retains \"ownership.\" Installation and training for Superbase 4 was simple, according to Eddie de Souza, business systems manager at BA, who allows a mere three hours per site for training, excluding travel. \"The product lends itself to the end-user market,\" comments Mr de Souza. \"Superbase 4 allows you to create intuitive applications where the only limitation is in the mind of the developer. We merely provide a vehicle for integration and distribution of data,\" he concludes. Mr de Souza is more than pleased with Superbase 4, which he says has made the interpretation of data easier for users.

The exclusion of a vendor or product does not imply that they are inferior in any way. Some purchasers of PC database products may be concerned about the size of the vendor company, but it should be noted that many of the larger vendors have a wide portfolio of products of which the PC database is just a part.

There are a mere four PCs in the training department, and ten times that number throughout the company. Foxpro was chosen for its ease of use and adaptability, since the constant devel- opment of the television industry brings a steady stream of new demands on the training section. \"We used Foxpro initially to set up a database of the syllabus and trainees,\" explains Jeremy Cavanagh, training man- ager. \"We wanted to keep track of who had done what courses, when and where, on operating a variety of TV equipment.\" The original application has now extended to syllabus and accounting infor- mation. The system allows the instructors to look at levels of achievement and assign skill levels, broadening the scope to co-or- dinate with industry-wide developments. A number of database files, such as syllabus, allow the users to \"mix and match\" infor- mation. Foxpro has paid off with its flexibility and ability to allow interaction between files, and constant changes to reporting formats. Ed Boyce, the head of the depart- ment who brought his allegiance to Fox- pro with him from the BBC, is reported to make the changes to the database at home, in front of the TV. The system runs independently of TV-AM's DEC MicroVax, but, according to Mr Cavanagh, there is little disadvantage to this, since all information relies on key- board input in any case, and the system is designed specifically for TV journalism. Only the training department uses Fox- pro: dBase and Nantucket's Clipper are the standards elsewhere in TV-AM. The main benefits have been the saving of time and paper in record-keeping and accounting, with ready access to budgets: other depart- ment tend to use spreadsheets for such jobs.",

   "text_content" : "* Supplier: Gupta Technology, a private US-based company, was founded in 1984 by Umang P. Gupta and D. Bruce Scott. In the UK, Gupta is located at Marlow, Bucks. * Product Gupta's SQLSystem includes a range of database products: SQLWindows - a graphical programming environment aimed at professional application developers; Quest - a data access, query and reporting tool. This is aimed at PC users who wish to use a graphical environment and access and manip- ulate information from SQL databases without having to know SQL; SQLBase - an SQL database server designed to run in a local area network environment. SQLBase conforms to IBM's Systems Applica- tions Architecture (SAA); SQLNetwork - a set of products which allows Gupta's products to access other databases, including IBM's DB2 and Oracle. * Hardware hosts: Gupta's products are avail- able on all popular hardware platforms includ- ing MS/DOS, OS/2 and UNIX. * Connectivity: The Gupta product range is based on client-server architecture which has been designed into all the products from their inception. Gupta provides connections to other servers. The primary benefits are that the \"cli- ents\" can use a graphical style to present information and a variety of different database servers can be connected to one single \"cli- ent.\" This enables local area networks to run multi-user database applications. * Pricing: SQLWindows developers' system, Â£1,295; connection to DB2 on a mainframe, up to Â£85,000. 0 USSR VIEW: EAGLE STAR LIFE assurance and pensions company Eagle Star Life has around 1,000 PCs, largely Compaqs, and there are plans for another 700 or so. The Gupta database software was first acquired for sales and marketing systems, to help the administration of the sales team, and it is planned that eventually the Gupta system will have about 800 users. It is linked to the mainframe IBM 3090, which holds most of the corporate infor- mation on IBM mainframe databases such as DB/2 and IMS. The applications planned for Gupta include sales tracking, business submis- sion, management information, and other sales administration. Already spin-off systems are making an appearance, partic- ularly small operational systems such as cost-centre management and management accounts. The sales system on the PC downloads data from the mainframe, but also feeds information back, particularly advice on specific proposals. Exchange is through a two-stage process, through first the local area network (LAN) at the headquarters, then onto the Novell LAN which supports Gupta. Installation of the Gupta software, according to Mr David Carrie, projects manager for the sales and marketing sys- tem, was \"more complex than we'd like.\" The company was already 'running in' Windows software: things became easier as they moved across to the LAN. The applications were developed in-house by the systems department, not by the end users themselves. \"We see them as operational systems rather than individual, end user applica- tions\" explains Mr Carrie. \"I dislike the phrase 'mission critical', but some would call them that\" The question of who owns the data is an interesting one at Eagle Star - \"it's a matter of who 'owns' the client, and sev- eral different people have a relationship with the client. We expect the users in sales to care for their own data,\" explains Mr Carrie. A disciplined cost-benefit study under- taken at Eagle Star shows a marginal sav- ing of costs, particularly saving on main- frame CPU, but the main benefit, of productivity, is harder to quantify, as is the issue of controlling the proliferation of end-user applications. \"The PC is a personal tool as well\" com- ments Mr Carrie. \"Some of the productiv- ity gains are from allowing people to cus- tomise, although we try to impose guidelines otherwise we can't support users. There's a delicate balance to achieve between allowing individuals to customise, and the delivery of a corporate tool, especially in a LAN environment\" Dealer rooms ar an area where graphical user Interfaces (GUIs) are making a significant Impact by helping dealers to ncreasee their effectiveness.

   "text_content" : "CITY-BASED stockbroker Smith New Court aims to create a range of applica- tions over the next two years, reflecting the core of its stockbroking and stock-job- bing operations. With 600 to 700 PCs already installed, it has chosen a client-server structure, an idea that many people in the computer industry are promoting but have yet proved in action. (Because of this, Soft- ware At Work has recounted Smith New Court's user experiences in detail and hopes to return for a follow-up site visit in a future issue.) The systems are based around four types of data: in-house trading informa- tion, client information, company informa- tion and share price information. The company took a pragmatic approach to choosing the best database and the best \"front end\" or user interface for the planned systems. It looked at two of each, and tried out all four by building a prototype for one of the actual applica- tions. The two database \"back ends\" were Microsoft's SQLServer and Gupta's SQLbase, using the two front-ends MDBS' Object/I and Gupta's SQLWindows. \"I think it's very important to evaluate the tools using a real application\" explains Mr Greg Dowling, agency systems man- ager. \"Otherwise, it is too easy to get attached to the technical features while not really worrying about how easy it is to deliver the applications you users need.\" The users made the choice, after looking at the two tidied-up' prototypes. Gupta came out on top \"not because of the qual- ity of the database,\" comments Mr Dow- ling, \"but because the SQL Windows devel- opment tool was so productive for building database applications. The type of develop- ment I expected to take weeks could be done in days using SQL Windows. It may not be as flexible as other tools, but what it does, it does excellently.\" Mr Dowling points out that in any case, the structure of client-server networks means that most of the investment is in the front end. If Smith New Court subse- quently wanted to change the \"back end,\" even moving to the existing company Vax computer using the Oracle database, it could do so, leaving most of the applica- tions largely unchanged. The first applications are going live as Software At Work goes to press, but plans for the next are already well under way. \"It's very important to see the database as a resource for a number of applications, not just a single application, because if you don't, users will be asking for other related applictions, and then you're sunk.\" Almost all of the data for the first appli- cation derives from the Vax settlement system. Some, mostly client information, is maintained in the PC system, but 90 per cent of it is kept up to date by the Vax. The data is transferred to the Gupta database using a Digital Equipment prod- uct on the Vax, previously called PCSA, now known as Pathworks, and some sim- ple code, written in the C language, which picks up a file of changes from the'Vax, and then applies them to the PC files to keep them in line with the corporate data. All this is done overnight by the Vax. \"Normally, no-one needs to touch the PC unless something goes wrong,\" says Mr Dowling. The PC also runs some tests to search out any database inconsistencies. The entire database contains a year's data, and takes up about 50 megabytes. One of the advantages of the Gupta \"back-end,\" according to Mr Dowling, is that once the data is fed into it, it's available to any applications that want it. \"One of the beauties of client-server is that in the server, you're only worried about the data, and you worry about how to use it in the applications. Right now, there is only one applications working from this data, but we've built a simple prototype were users can access the data direct from an Excel spreadsheet. (Excl is a popular PC spreadsheet product) \"To my mind, this is what client-server is all about, keeping the data in such a way that both specialist applications and user ad-hoc needs can be easily catered for. Before client server, most PC database applications' database structure was so specific to a single application that it was useless for anything else. That is definitely the wrong way to put together a database. \"The easy interchange of data between various hardware sources is what makes this approach so flexible for Smith New Court, but it also raises the question of who owns the data. Mr Dowling's response to this is unequivocal. \"Someone put it to me the other day: 'if you don't let the users change the data, pretty soon the data you have isn't the data that matters, as they'll create their own copy, and update that.' \"To me this is very important. The data is owned by the users, not by the data processing department. It's important to make sure that the data is looked after, but it's vital to remember that it is there to help the users do their job.\" Since most of data is derived from the Vax mainframe for the first application, maintaining data integrity is not a prob- lem. For installation, Smith New Court sub-contracted to a third party. The appli- cations were written by an in-house pro- grammer, \"a real expert,\" who specialises in programming the C and C+ + lan- guages. \"While the client-server tools are very productive, to really get the most out of them, you need a great deal of technical and design skill,\" warns Mr Dowling. \"But you can probably get away with one very good programmer, rather than an army of ordinary ones. None of the consultancies I talked to could provide the expertise I was looking for.\" The PCs bought for those users who previously only had their financial ser- vices terminals are being used for further applications: there's a chance that the PCs will make the terminals completely redun- dant as data service vendors start to deliver their products to PCs. Smith New Court is making a careful evaluation of both the costs and the bene- fits. Mr Dowling sums them up: \"The stan- dard client server benefits: the data is available very easily to any applications that need it, and provide that the database is properly designed, it isn't specific to one application. \"In particular, the Gupta tools for Excel, and other windows applications, make using the core data very simple. Using the Gupta tools it is possible to produce a very high quality user-interface very easily, building four or five versions of the proto- type to make sure that the users like the way applications look. In the past it has been too expensive to an end user to do this.\" In the long-term, says Mr Dowling, development costs should come down due to the use of off-the-shelf development tools, although as yet, there is not enough experience to confirm his hunch. He plans to use Excel and Word for Windows, which both work well with client-server architec- ture. In terms of hardware cost, the sys- tem currently runs on fairly cheap, fairly low-spec 386 machines - \"we have plenty of headroom for bigger systems if we need it.\" But a real spin-off benefit has been the ability to explain the potential of the tech- nology to users via prototypes - \"very much better than 15 pages of techno- speak.\" Users are able to write their own appli- cations if they wish: Smith New Court's recommended choice for do-it-yourself applications writers is Dataease, although some decide to use alternative packages. \"We don't see our job as saying 'no' to users,\" says Mr Dowling. \"If they want to do their own thing, that's up to them, and our PC support department will do its best to help them. But if it's something impor- tant, we like to make sure the data is secure, and properly maintained, and as accurate as possible. \"Until recently this has been a big prob- lem, with traditional DP being difficult and expensive, and PC systems being hard to maintain, and keep safe and secure. Client-server offers a neat solution, allow- ing users to get at their data quickly and simply, using their standard PC packages, while offering all the traditional safe- guards.\""

   "text_content" : "* Supplier: Oracle, founded in the US in 1977; established in UK in 1984. * Product: Oracles's PC database products are targeted at organisations building integrated client-server systems. Based around the ORACLE relational database management system, client products include the Database and Tools for MS-DOS and OS/2; Oracle Card, a Windows-based multimedia development tool; and Oracle for Windows with DDE Manager, a Windows application integration tool. Server products include ORACLE Servers for NetWare 386, OS/2 UNIX, Banyan VINES and Macintosh. Client products were released from 1987 onward; PC-based servers from 1990. * Connectivlty: Oracle's PC-based client products can connect to most of the hundred-plus hardware platforms supported by the Oracle RDBMS via its SQL Net software, as well as access non-Oracle data through Oracle SQL Connect. * Sales and support: Oracle sells to and supports the end-user directly. * Pricing: Oracle tools database: Â£999; Oracle card, Â£299; Oracle for windows with DDE manager.

According to Mr Bernard Howard, the information technology director, this is the largest distributed database in education in Britain, providing a single academic information network. \"We have a well-defined structure for IT information providers. Everyone is involved in the formulation of standards. Oracle is our primary database system, but users are encouraged to fulfil their local needs with whatever software they want. Our job then is to link their data to the central, audited, database.\" In this way, users are able to use products like Lotus 1-2-3 to manipulate their own data, which may originate with them, or come from the central database. The data is then passed on to the central database to be available to the whole network. \"The process is made transparent to the individual users by use of routines using Microsoft's Windows 3 interface, developed by the IT department. \"Not everything needs to be handled the same way, as long as your core system retains its integrity,\" says Mr Howard. The users \"own\" the data. This is a major departure from the old-time view that data is controlled by the information technology (IT) department, and that users are \"allowed\" to access their data by that department. Mr Howard sees a major shift in emphasis: \"People at user-sites absolutely 'own' their data. We merely provide the necessary links.\" Different users have different database needs, of course. On the other hand, a central data store must be well-audited and controlled by a single database management system. Devon County Council's solution to these opposing arguments seems to be very successful. The IT department, instead of being a grudging guardian and supplier of information becomes a true service provider, supplying the necessary \"glue\" to hold together the users' disparate requirements. FUTURE REVIEWS O In future issues of Software at Work, we shall include further product profiles and user reports on PC databases as well as software applications in manufacturing. O For more details of the next issue, see page four. * Supplier Sybase was founded in 1984 and released its Sybase database product in 1987. * Product Sybase has about 2,000 user sites worldwide of which 120 are in the UK. Sybase is also licensed to Microsoft for OS/2 and Stratus as SQL 2000 which accounts for further sales. It is not possible to identify the total number of users as most sites buy a corporate licence which allows for an unlimited number of users. Sybase is said by its developer to be commonly accepted as \"the architect of client-server online relational database management systems.\" SMarket areas: Sybase markets products in three main areas: client-server relational database products; client-server connectivity products; and client-server tools for application building and data manipulation.

   "text_content" : "Modern manufacturing relies heavily on advanced software systems to control production. Phi4p Manchester examines traditional and innovative approaches to the problem MANUFACTURING has always been one of the primary applications of com- puter software and, after accountancy, is one of the main activities to be auto- mated. There is a wide range of software packages available to cover every con- ceivable aspect of the manufacturing process from the use of computer-aided design (CAD) in the technical drawing department to optimisation of the deliv- eries in the distribution department. In this issue of Software at Work we concentrate on the kernel of any manu- facturing operation - the processes which take place between the receipt of an order from a customer, to the issue of a delivery note/invoice for the fin- ished goods. Essentially, these processes break down into three groups: order-process- ing, production planning and produc- tion control The order-processing func- tion covers receipt of a customer order and stock control. Depending on the type of manufactur- ing operation, this can involve checlking whether there is product available by the required delivery date - either from stock or from the current produc- tion schedule. Production planning cov- ers inventory control, raw materials purchasing and the creation of the pro- duction schedule. It also includes allocation of resources - for materials, production capacity and labour. Advanced systems use com- plex mathematical optimisation proce- dures to ensure that these resources are being used efficiently. Production control covers monitoring of work-in-progress, quality control and goods despatch. This involves ensuring that the required materials or compo- nents are available at the right time and the right place, that the end product meets the customer's specifications and that it gets delivered as quickly as pos- sible. Many software packages cover all of these processes - although most of them come in the form of 'plug-in' mod- ules designed to suit specific manufac- turing conditions. Some industries build products to order, some build for stock and some combine both methods. In all cases the requirements are different and the software must be flexible enough to handle them. The integration and control of these processes is central to any successful manufacturing operation in the 1990s and increasingly sophisticated software packages are available to cope with the problem. New techniques such as concurrent engineering, optimised production and Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing allow modern industry to keep production costs and stock and inventory levels down. But the installation of a comput- erised manufacturing system is not easy. It demands a clear understanding of manufacturing process and the sac- tors at play in the particular market sector which the manufacturer is serv- ing. It is not enough to make the manufac- turing process efficient. It must be flexi ble and capable of changing to meet new market conditions - especially in the fast-moving competitive world mar ket of the 1990s. One clear lesson to emerge from users' experiences is that automation of the manufacturing process must be gradual and carefully controlled. Employees must be convinced that the system can be trusted and only then will they use it. The first generation of manufacturing systems, which emerged in the 1970s, was based on old batch-processing tech- nology and left much to be desired. As ERF Trucks (page 19) and Edwards of Enfileld (page 22) found, the old batch systems took too long to provide crucial information such as production plans and stock levels. Often the reports that were produced related to a historical situation which had long since passed. Modern manufac- turing control systems provide on-line access to data through display termi- nals and allow all those involved in the manufacturing process to keep track of goods as they progress from customer orders until they leave the factory. Increasingly, modern manufacturing software provides an integrated approach which promises to bring all aspects of the process together. Theoret- ically, a design engineer can \"draw\" a product with CAD system, allocate a kit of parts with a materials requirements planning systems and generate the appropriate instructions - possibly in the form of a numerical control pro- gram for a 'robot' - to actually build the product. Few manufacturers have gone this far as yet. But many companies see this totally-integrated approach as essential if they are to maintain their position in the market. These systems bring other advantages too. Alcad (see page 24) found that it could drastically reduce its 'work-in- progress' by exercising control over its manufacturing operations with good software. ERF Trucks has used the flexibility cf its system to allow it to anticipate changes in production demand, and to plan well ahead of its production sched- ule. Flexibility is extremely important. Manufacturing software packages offer ihe basic structures for all manufactur- ing. But packages are, by their very nature, generalised and most users will need additional programs to produce special reports or to cope with extraor- dinary conditions which are peculiar to the specific industry. Nowadays most packages offer sea- tures for customised reporting and can handle special conditions with cus- tom-built modules. But potential users should be aware that such extensions can add significantly to the costs of a software package. This is especially important because it is rare for a manu- facturing software package to be able to mneet all of a customer's needs and some additional software will almost certainly be reauired.",

   "text_content" : "A manager seeking benefits from software systems in a manufacturing company first has to penetrate the computer terminology. Michael Powell explains the acronyms. COMPUTERS offer tantalising benefits in the automation processes used in manufac- turing industries. If factory managers can use their order books to forecast require- ments for raw materials, they should be able to substantially reduce raw material inventory costs. Moreover, because manufacturers can more accurately estimate future labour requirements, they can make accurate plans for work and manpower schedules. Then, with the aid of a computerised system for purchase ordering, inventory control and sales order processing, factories can, in the- ory, manage their entire manufacturing operation automatically. The first attempts to realise these benefits came with the automatic recording and pro- cessing of so-called \"bills of materials\" - those lists of parts and labour requirements which go into making a finished product. By applying various scale factors to a parts and labour forecast, managers can identify what resources they will need to create products and how long the process will take. IBM, for example, produced one of the first \"bill of materials processors\" (BOMP) software packages. This automated the conventional parts \"explosion,\" creating a hierarchy of compo- nents. However, the production planning process was not really helped much - since production bottlenecks could not be identi- fled by this technique alone. Purchasing departments were not particu- larly helped either, because the system did not identify when in the cycle a part was needed. The system lacked integration with the manufacturing process. Materials Requirements Planning (MRP) systems, such as IBM's Production and Inventory Control System (PICS); were. intridiuced in the early 1970s to addrss some of these problems. They added the time element to the Bill of Materials t identify the critical manufactii'ng points.' These products offered a much more use- ful capability, enabling manufacturers to control material shortages, ensuring that enough components were available to main- tain production targets. Since MRP systems could identify which components would be needed, and when, software suppliers evolved methods for \"driving\" the supply of parts. MRP systems apply information about stock levels from J~L- inventory control systems to determine when to order more stocks. These systems took into account the suppliers' lead times and the necessary stock levels. At the output end, the sales order-process- ing system fed the requirements data into the-system. To separate this type of software from the earlier products, the term \"MRP II' came to be used - \"MRP\" now standing for \"Manu- facturing Resource Planning.\" Not all manufacturing consists of making up products from discrete parts. Paint-mak- ing, for example, involves the use of mea- sured quantities of chemicals. These processes - known as continuous process manufacturing - require somewhat different control techniques, to allow for wastage and the statistical errors which are endemic in quantity measurement. A company's inventory of irw-materials represents a big cost overhead. Many ianu- facturers are turning to MRP If systems to provide them with \"Just in Time\" (JIT) capabilities. The technique is obvious enough: only order parts when you know that theyj will be needed - and delaythat order until the last possible moment. JIT implies the constant updating of I I actual stock levels - normally in real time. Conventional MRP systems often cannot cope with such processing. Even where they can, the most difficult job is to communicate ordering require- ments rapidly to suppliers. Full JIT systems need to control commu- nications links to many of these suppliers. Indeed, the complexity of networks which become necessary as a manufacturer con- nects to his supplier - who in turn con- nects to his own - can tax the most sophis- ticated communications systems. Big fleas have little fleas - perhaps not ad infinitum, but certainly to a good degree.",

   "text_content" : "A vehicle manufacturer applies the benefits of accurate data and control of change which come from flexible manufacturing software. Philip Manchester reports. IT is reasonable to suppose that a lorry is a lorry and a truck is a truck. But a combina- tion of legislation and customer-demand for \"specials\" means that, in the big truck industry, a truck is not a truck until it rolls off the production line. A specification from a customer for a new truck can change significantly, by the time the truck is ready for the road. Specifica- oinns hriana e durinna nrMduVIirnn hallBO tho customer wants extra modifications. Compo- nents might be changed to suit safety regu- lations. Or a substitute component at a lower price might be found. Thus, a flexible, computer-based, manu- facturing control system is essential to keep track of specification changes to a complex products. ERF, the UK truck-maker based in Sandbach, Cheshire, has found that a flexi- ble manufacturing system, backed up by good computer software, has helped it sur- vive the ups and downs of the last four years. The market for heavy trucks and \"trac- tors\" is volatile. A change in government legislation - like the increase in the per- mitted weight of trucks introduced in the 1980s - can mean boom time for truck builders. At the other extreme, truck builders are among the first manufacturers to feel the pinch in a recession, as hauliers extend the life of their existing fleet to keep costs down. In both cases, flexible manufacturing systems can help. \"During the late 1980s we trebled produc- tion - from seven vehicles a day to 21 vehicles a day - in about two years. With- out the system we would never have got above 12 vehicles a day,\" explains ERF Trucks' executive data processing manager, David Rothery. ERF uses Macpac, a manufacturing con- trol software package developed by Andersen Consulting. The software has helped the company to weather the ups and downs of the last four years. First introduced in 1988, the system has brought greater control over production and distributed vital information to all those involved in the manufacturing cycle and beyond. Most important, says Mr Rothery, is that everyone trusts the system. \"The old system was a batch system and it used to fail more times than it worked. No one trusted it. It was an ancient, cus- tom-built system, designed to run on ICL equipment and then converted to Data Gen- eral hardware,\" says Mr Rothery. \"We were trying to convince the users that a new MRP package was the way to go. But the company was trying to impose a system based on the old one, so the users were against it They were not against MRP. But they were really against the imposition of the system which they could not trust\" 'In 1967 we looked at what IBM had to offer by comparison - not only did it look better, it was cheaper,\" Mr Rothery says The investment in the new system co-in- cided with a significant upturn in ERFs business at the end of the 1980s and proved itself capable of handling the rapid expan- sion in production. Now that times are tighter, ERF is using Macpac to give it the flexiblity to build \"standard\" trucks which can be modified to meet customer orders when they come in. \"We have to work a lot harder for the fewer sales that you can get and the system has helped in providing information. We have a feature which gives a bilot-materi- als comparison, for example. \"The people in the materials department think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. They used to work like mad trying to satisfy a customer's specifications - run- ning around the suppliers if they got a late -- -- change. 'he system means these can be processed in a few minutes instead of hours or days,\" he says. ERF specialises in the heavy end of the truck market from 17 tons to 40 tons. It builds both \"tractors,\" to haul container loads, and \"rigid\" trucks. Although there Continued on next page Deter Foden, chairman of ERF Trucks: a volatile markeL 12 / M ANUATRN Electronic nerve centre: David Rothery In the computer complex at ERF Trucks at Sandbach, Cheshire. Continued from previous page are only a few basic \"families\" of trucks, there are hundreds of potential combina- tions which can be constructed from a basic set of components. * The company markets 400 different mod- els of truck - but there is potential for as many as 3,000. The bill-of-materials com- parison feature lets ERF's production plan- ners identify a \"standard\" truck which most closely meets a customer's order. ERF plans its production up to six months ahead, based on its assessment of market trends and the orders it expects from customers. The forecasting system uses the bill-of-materials database to work out material requirements for \"standard\" trucks, which allows the material buyers to negotiate the best possible deals with ERF's component suppliers. As the production cycle advances, changes to the specifications of the \"stan- dard\" trucks can be recorded and fed through to the material requirements fore- cast. These changes are usually the result of a \"standard\" truck being allocated to a customer order. \"About 50 per cent of the orders are received less than three weeks before the trucks are actually built. With the system we have, we can still take an order even after we have kitted the materials,\" Mr Rothery explains. The final specification is printed out as a \"build\" sheet, which is used to construct the truck. Details of each specification are also kept in the production database which can be accessed at various points on the shop floor through display tenrmina's. The early introduction of terminals on the shop floor brought advantages: \"Once we got through the first phase we decided to bring forward the introduction of termi- nals on the shop floor. And it was abso- lutely the right thing to do. They started checking out the specifications and bill of materials because they still had a reputa- tion for being inaccurate,\" says David Rothery. Mike Morton, head of the specifications department and the man responsible for the accuracy of the bill of materials (BOM), was worried that opening the data up to scrutiny would show up all the errors. \"The batch system was always out-of-date. It relied on weekend process- ing. When we entered the BOM data into the new system we spent a lot of time breaking down the specification for every truck into individual elements and check- ing them. \"We were concerned to have safety nets all the way through and spend time polic- ing the data,\" explains Mr Morton. He was, it turned out, \"wrong to worry.\" Mr Rothery comments: \"Mike came out of it well. The BOM was pretty accurate. It was great - we had things that were being blamed on BOM inaccuracies. Now we had to find some other reason for it.\" The attention paid to the accuracy of the specification data has other benefits. ERF uses the same database to feed its Vehicle Information System - the latest enhancement to its information processing system. The software, developed using the Synon application-building package, pro- duces a complete inventory of compo- nents, together with operational specifica- tions, for every truck ERF makes. Within two days of the vehicle's comple- tion, this documentation can be circulated to its service contractors around the coun- try for maintenance and warranty pur- poses. This level of service adds an edge to ERF's fight for sales in a highly-competi- tive market. It also gives every ERF truck the equivalent of an individual \"pedigree,\" which will accompany the vehicle throughout its life.",

The nature of its business is heavy truck manufacture. The company is a survivor from a bygone age of British engineering. Founded in 1933 by Edwin Richard ; oden of the famous Foden family, the company has always had a reputation for pioneering innovation. ERF was started to build high-quality diesel trucks and has been responsible for advancing the state of the art in truck technology ever since. The company pioneered the concept component-buying in the 1930s when its competitors still made everything in their own foundries. In the 1950s ERF introduced the first streamlined cab design with the KV model and has continued to innovate with fibre glass/steel cabs, power steering and better suspension. Computer systems have played an increasing role in ERF's manufacturing operations in the last five years - especially with the transition to the current Macpac system. * Key personnel: Peter Foden, chairman; David Rothery, executive data processing manager. * Company turnover: Â£120m.

   "text_content" : "For manufacturing companies the squirrel can become a dangerous animal on the shop floor, warns Kevin Grumball. I r. THE TERM \"work in progress\" (WIP) hides one of the bogeymen of manufacturing. The phrase can be heard around many a factory, but the management is often unaware of its true cdst. Various departments have a \"squirrel\" who hoards away his own little hoard of components or finished goods, \"iust in case.\" Then, when a rush order comes in, he is ready to meet the challenge. The more suc- cessful squirrels may even be viewed as heroes because they always deliver in a crisis. However, the total amount of cash tied up in the total of these hoards can be staggering. The costs are generally hidden. Managers often look at the change in WIP, rather than the absolute amount. Many probably feel that their level of WIP is an inevitable part of their business. Unless they have per- formed the rigorous analysis that is required for a computer system, then the WIP is almost certainly too high. Capital that should be employed in growing the business is instead gathering dust around the site. One aim of the manufacturing systems that we have examined is to reduce the level of WIP. Alcad (see the case sudy, page 24) succeeded in reducing its WIP from Â£4m to Â£2m in just 12 months. That means Â£2m available for research and development, marketing or whatever the management decides, without going to the City of London or the bankers. There is one slight snag - the apparent effect on the ba'ance sheet. WIP is shown as \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t an asset (although it might well oe viewed as a liability) in the accounts. A company that reduces its WIP may also seem to reduce its assets. Some companies have even slowed-up the introduction of optim- ised production technology (OPT) or manu- facturing resource planning (MRP-II) in order to massage their balance sheets. Nevertheless, the smart investor or ana- lyst will always look at the return on capital employed (RoCE) as the final measure of success. This takes the total profit and divides it by the total of all the capital in the business, including equity, fixed assets, WIP, stock andl so on. The result gives the profit produced for every pound or dollar invested in the business. To be a reasonable investment, the return on capital employed should usually be greater than the current interest rate avail- able from a building society. If not, the shareholders might be better advised to invest elsewhere. Decreasing the WIP means decreasing the amount of capital employed but for the same level (usually) of profit. Thus, the RoCE increases and the shareholders get a better deal. The moral is: \"If you want to increase your return, stop the squirrels!\"",

   "text_content" : "Edwards of Enfield could provide a novelist with an entire dynastic saga. Claire Gooding unfolds a tale of dashed expectations and lost fortunes, with the chance of a happy ending. Teamwork: Linda Lund and Fred Runeckles - ensuring the next generation of Edwards' technology runs smoothly. THE 'TALE of Edwards of Enfield recalls the genre of dynastic saga. Edwards is a close-knit family comany, keeping one step ahead of the international competition with constant inventiveness. But the computer, bought to help both administration as well as production, turns out to be the villain of the piece. Edwards, suppliers of custom-built alu minium extrusion equipment, is honest about where it went wrong with the com- pruter system, partly - as company secre- tary Linda Lund explains - because previ- ous mistakes have taught the company lessons which now form the basis of Edwards future development. \"We've learned a great deal,\" she says. \"This time around, we spent more time thinking, we specified our needs, looked at many different packages - and recognised that support was the number one consider- ation. We still don't use material require- ments planning (MRP) properly, even now, but people are learning to trust the new system.\" Twin brothers, Jim and Sam Edwards, founded the company 38 years ago. It has a true niche market, supplying custom-built equipment worldwide. Kith-and-kin abound within the company: family members (the brothers each have two children, all four employed by Edwards) worked their way through the ranks, where everyone - from shop floor to reception - seems to know one another and \"belong.\" The co-founder and chairman, Mr Jim Edwards, provides the \"front\" figure - pur- suing the larger sales opportunities, opening up new areas of operation and cooperation overseas. His brother is the back-room tech- nical force now in charge of an entire team of designers. The company typically processes around ten main orders in one year, usually adapt- ing basic designs and programmable logic controllers to specific situations. The lifecy- cle of the machines they produce is mea- sured in decades, so there is little return custom, apart from vital trade in spares and maintenance. The bulk of Edwards' work is to equip new plants: an order may be anything from a one-off machine, such as a puller or a saw, up to an entirely automatic plant. Up to 85 per cent of Edwards' products are exported. Even in the recession, the order books are full for a year ahead, and few orders are cancelled, though some are delayed. A near-disaster struck the company in 1985: a wrong-footed decision about a critical computer system. A million pounds went down the drain: production was slowed, vital information was lost, but an inventory of useless components mounted, resulting in Â£150,000 worth of obsolete stock. The resultant chaos had to be fought from day to day, with 2,000 suppliers - and thou- sands of raw and part-completed compo- nents - untracked. Noone even took the accounting system off the shelf, until the arrival of Linda Lund she was head-hunted and recruited as Edwards' company secretary in April 1987. Inravelling the accounting mess brought her a dual responsibility: that of systems manager. But Ms Lund's role as a dedicated iromoter of computer systems was an uphill one until January 1990, when the chief executive, Mr Roger Levick, the \"pro- essional MD,\" joined the company. He championed Linda Lund's efforts to intro- duce new technology. \"Any mention of a change of system sent he board into 'valium mode,\"' recalls Ms Lund. \"They'd only just got over major problems with the last system.\" Today she i refreshingly frank about the early mis akes over the computer system Edwards chose previously. Admittedly, this system was installed during the time of a previous Managing director. \"He wasn't here long; he left, so he got blamed. But it seems that the Jobber-Trader system was picked simply because it was supplied by ICL, and therefore was presum- ably OK. \"He was right that we needed the system, but wrong in the way it was picked and implemented: he kept it away from the peo- ple who should have been involved,\" she believes. In the light of experience, Linda Lund is able to pin 60 per cent of the problems caused on the way the system was imple- mented. At installation, the 25,000 part num- bers were re-numbered, so that no-one knew what any of the numbers meant. It fell to Mr Fred Runeckles, commercial director, to make the ICL System 25 soft. ware work, with the help of a technician. At one time, the supplier had to call on-site practically every day, and never less than once a week. \"One of the main problems was support. The suppliers never actually gave us much advice, never told us what we should or shouldn't do. They'd arrive and ask, 'What do you want to know?' - but never, 'What's the problem?' - which was very unhelpful,\" says Mr Runeckles. \"It's often difficult for a remote help-desk to assist when they are dealing with software which has been adjusted to reflect a singular viewpoint. \"Their usual response was that we'd pushed the system further than most users, so nobody knew the answers. The techni- cian saved the day. We'd have gone under, or chucked it out, without him.\" The old system actually hampered operations, encouraging a build-up of obso- lete parts. The Material Requirements Plan- ning (MRP) module took a minimum 40 hours to run. Ms Lund attributes to it a loss of profits, late contracts, and even loss of customers \"because we couldn't tell what we had supplied to whom in the first place.\" There was no exception reporting and lit- tle integration. \"Once you start measuring, you start dis- covering how much cutting corners' really costs.\" Continued on next page Continued from previous page The fundamettal mistake, according to Mr David Jones of the consultancy Noble Drake, was that the original decision- maker failed to carry the board with him. Subsequently, David Jones and his com- pany was brought in by Roger Levick who wanted systems experts to assess the com- pany's needs and to sort out the problems. David Jones became absorbed into the Edwards culture - and still works there one day in a week. He was aware of long-term plans to re-build the entire office, introduce computer-aided design and integrate all the systems into one. \"There was a danger of doing too much, too quickly,\" he recalls. \"One of the tricks is to manage the rate of change, to get the priorities, and the sequence right. In the meantime, we need a small, clear, number of objectives.\" He specified a Unix system because it was already a de facto standard - \"I'm not really bothered about Unix itself: it's just that it provided 'openness' for the long-term future, and a wide choice of manufacturing systems linked to account- ing and costing.\" Wihen it came to the detailed software specification, only a few suppliers made it to the shortlist, including Tetra's Chame- leon, Pegasus, and Sky. Detailed evalua- tion took three months. To Linda Lund, the choice of supplier company was as vital as the package. Sky ost because Edwards were not impressed by the supplier's presentation, but Foun- iation Systems won on several grounds .ith the final choice, Tetra's Chameleon package. Not only did Foundation offer a dll-time MRP expert, but a full range of support, including hardware maintenance, \"They were local, professional, and the ight size for us,\" comments Ms Lund. The managing director's impetus behind he change was critical in pushing hrough the decision - \"my role was to calm down the more destructive critics, and we did try to win a higher-than-aver age acceptance factor throughout the com- pany,\" comments Mr Levick. He adds wryly: \"It wasn't easy: 60 per cent of my staff only understand a welding torch, a hammer, and a metre rule - and the metre rule was a big battle.\" Once again, the 25,000 parts were re lumbered, this time by Mr Runeckles, who systematically calls a nut a NUT, with its number attached. From choice tc nstallation took nine months, and the sys em was operative by December 1, 1990. As yet, there is little visible evidence of an integrated system which permeates the company: no terminals on the machine- room floor or in the acres of assembly sheds. But Mr Levick's long-term aim is to cre- ate a so-called real-time, responsive envi- ronment: he even wants to adopt some of he \"service\" ideas of the software indus- try, such as a 24-hour help-desk for cus- tomers all over the world. Ms Lund relies on her \"sergeants\" on he shop floor, such as supervisor Vince Ravner, to create 'build' centres so that each person takes responsibility for a sec- ion of plant. This has helped awareness of what the company is trying to achieve. \"The computer didn't always give accu- ate information in the past: the new sys- em will give them easy access to more information, and a much higher degree of accuracy. They'll be able to see the conse- quences of their actions,\" she comments. \"This time, we have involved everyone and won a consensus for what we are ioing. It's important to make people aware hat the system is only a tool.\" Concensus is a slow process: it has taken four years to get computer-aided iesign (CAD) installed, despite the obvious advantages for the kind of repetitive, adap- ive designs in which Edwards specialises. \"Customers are getting more clued-up,\" comments Ms Lund. \"We've tended to keep quiet about technology because we're almost embarrassed about the low level, up to now. But now it's essential, because of the volume of drawings and their value.\" Alongside the next leap in technology, Edwards will be looking at electronic mail and other spin-off information'systems, most of which are currently scattered across the company on standalone PCs. Starting with new accounting and man- urcturing systems, the plan is to expand nto CAD and related technology. .The I I management consultants John Lloyd and Partners are helping plan an entire draw- ing office system, and putting in place the appropriate management structure. Mr John Rowe, who is the John Lloyd consultant at Edwards, believes further long-term benefits will accrue - \"it's a question of destroying pre-conceptions. The computer produces information which forces people to question and analyse - otherwise they go on doing what they've always done.\" After several years of costly chaos with its manufacturing and accounting systems, Edwards has evolved a policy which takes one cautious step at a time. There's a happy ending to this particu- lar chapter of the family saga: Fred Runeckles and Linda Lund have recently announced their engagement. Linda Lund reveals herself as Jim Edwards' daughter, (though the company which recruited her for the job was not aware of that fact) and - in real saga tradition - is soon to make Mr Runeckles \"one of the family.\"",

   "text_content" : "Kevin Grumball reflects on the roller coaster that will leave some companies gasping for breath, and others fighting fit, with strategy in place ie~P~F~l~arc~lllla~ II~ %Pra~ \"1~6~3~-s ~53rlPu~Cfl~~ar~l~Ep~'~eu~ndLÂ· ~lu ~~ rib ~lk~81E ~PiiQ ~^k~-4 THERE IS a saying among some financial pundits that \"if you want to become rich, you can do it best during a recession.\" Certainly there is evidence to show that at a large number of millionaires made much of their money out of crashes and in times of recession. For example, the Great Depression in America made more wealthy men than the periods before or after. The secret of all wealth is to look for real value. In a recession there is a trend towards under-valuation. Booms are fuelled by over-valued assets. That is why crashes (such as Black Monday) invariably follow boom periods - someone finally says that the asset is grossly over-valued and the market plummets. The current recession means that, far from doom and gloom, there is a large quantity of money to be made. However, if it was that simple, everyone would do it (and there would be no money around.) The secret is to anticipate the trends. Your route to riches will depend on your business. If there is normally a regular demand for your products - a market which is currently depressed, but which will return - consider making for stock. Producers can usually squeeze better prices out of their materials' suppliers in a recession. For example, the brick compa- nies did this in the last big downturn in house-building. They simply laid down acres of bricks and waited for the market to return. If your product is perishable (which includes out-of-date technology) or the demand is variable, then you must reduce your costs. Traditionally this implies shed- ding part of the workforce, but this leaves the company unprepared for an upturn. Recession is the ideal time for retraintng. Staff skills can be increased and their loy- alty and motivation retained. Training is an investment in the company's future. A recession is the best time to instal new systems, especially high technology. Typically, a new system has a period when it is operating below full capacity. That is best endured when demand is down. Mr Philip Margrave, managing director of Redland Roof Tiles, (see Software At Work Summer 1991) knew this and chose to install his new system when the market for tiles was down. That way, he is ready for an upturn and is better-equipped than his competitors. High technology costs money, so value must be ensured. Companies must demand that the system fits the real needs of the business. Potential buyers should criti- cally examine all the available suppliers, rather than buying from the approved cor- porate supplier. Look at their long-term plans and prospects. Since their business is also down, you can demand price reduc- tions and other concessions. Training com- panies are particularly hit by recessions, so they are especially eager to attract your business. Staff are much more willing to cooper- ate with the installation of new technology in a recession. Restrictive practices and other corporate fetters can be broken. There is much more questioning about the way things are done, while in prosperous times the attitude of many tends to be: \"It makes money, why change?\" But poor practices may only survive in a boom period. In the hard days of recession, efficiency becomes paramount. Since assets are under-valued in a reces- sion, it is also the time for acquisition. Buy to keep, not to sell again. Companies with bulging coffers can sensibly multiply their cash via assets. These assets must themselves be pruned, re-organised and prepared for future growth. Everything considered, this could be one of the best times to be running a company. Some of the survivors of this trough will become the millionaires of the next peak."

   "text_content" : "There were a few surprises in store when Alcad adopted Optimised Production Technology. But the company started to save on work in progress, once the staff learned to trust the system, as Kevin Grumball reports. nmnaur uoulneou; airungly commnmeua o new ecunnouogy unu nigner uIlnuarua u penorunancu. MR itiCHARD DOISNEAU, managing director of Alcad, knows production delays cost money and goodwill; he expects his investment in manufacturing software to save both - \"I want to be able to count all the late orders on the fingers of one hand,\" he says. Alcad manufactures pocket plate Nickel- Cadmium (NiCad) accumulators, mainly for industrial use. In 12 months, its use of optimised produc- tion technology (OPT) software, used along- side earlier systems, has reduced the value of work in progress from Â£4m to Â£2m. Mr Doisneau is pleased with the system so far, but wants still more out of it. At present, he estimates that there are around 20 orders which are delayed for some reason or other. He wants to reduce this to five or less - \"so that I can learn and remember them\". The story started back in 1988 when the then-managing director, Pierre Le Cocq, was given a copy of an OPT book on newer manufacturing techniques. He read this book while on flights and became enthusias tic about the philosophy behind it. He then commissioned David Spyer, now logistics executive, and another production controller to look further into it. Alcad already had an MRP (materials requirement planning) system in place but it had a number of limitations. As David Spyer explained, MRP considered capacity to be infinite and required considerable hand-tuning to get meaningful results. In addition, the MRP system was not fully understood or appreciated within the com- pany. \"We had MRP, but were not happy: there was a lack of drive and initiative to question why it had been installed. We had already recognised its inadequacies, especially in identifying capacity, and had written exten- sions.\" Alcad had looked at moving to MRP-II (an improved version) but felt that it still did not meet all their needs. With hindsight, Mr Spyer now feels that MRP- I only bridges the gap between MRP and OPT. \"OPT is a sort of brain transplant foi MRP. It turns the information MRP collec into something useful and realistic.\" Mr Spyer approached the Scheduling echnoogy Group (STG) who had dev. aped software for OPT. A number of staff were then introduced to the concepts of modelling and planning using computer sed pames. These were very successful and a number of the staff had to be draged away from the games at the end of the training sessions. A feasibility study and cost justification -alwed and they bought the sftware at the eni of NIa They had looked at us-- their own DP staff but decided against it. Instead, they used an OPT specialist, Time- gate, on a bureau basis. David Spyer explained that using Timegate decreased their risk in moving to a new system. The initial team consisted of a project manager, a programmer seconded from the DP department and a production planner. Timegate contributed one full-time member of staff and a senior consultant, Alan Rear- don, on an \"as-required basis.\" The Alcad team were subjected to a gruel- ling two week course during April 1989 and the system was planned to go into operation in two departments in August 1989, with the rest following by the end of the year. In the event, they over-ran by a mere two months and the system was live by February 1990. Mr Spyer describes OPT as \"a radical change in manufacturing systems.\" Their goal was to ensure that all the staff were adequately trained. This involved numerous group training sessions at all levels. The first to be trained were the senior executives who were introduced to OPT again by playing games. One of these games involved simulating a factory with different groups competing and using the OPT software to model the opera- tion of the factory. Yet again, the concepts proved addictive and the staff involved returned to their departments with a com- mitment to use these techniques in their own areas. The vision was passed down the line and cross-departmental groups were set up to start the planning. \"We nearly got the chairman himself playing computer games. It paid off because the culture was adopted top-down\" explains Mr Spyer. \"Production management, super- vision, marketing, technical, the union, everyone understood.\" OPT involves building a mathematical model of the whole factory. Therefore, it was appropriate to involve staff throughout the factory in its creation. Planning groups drew staff from marketing, technical design, finance, production and even union repre- sentatives. The involvement of the union was inter- esting, since, at that time, the union repre- sentative and the senior production man- ager were going through the annual wage negotiations. This meant frequent \"hat swapping\" during the planning process. The new managing director, Richard Dois- neau, arrived in early 1990 with the system a fait accompli He could see the benefits of the OPT and set about defining new stan- dards of performance. There were a number of areas within the company on which the new system had a significant impact. NiCad batteries consist of one or more cells. Each cell is made up from positive and negative plates suspended in a potassium hydroxide solution. Each plate is built from pockets of perforated mild steel filled with an \"active mass.\" The mass is either cadmium hydroxide for a negative plate or nickel hydroxide for a positive plate. The exact formulation and size determines the final operating charac- teristics of the cell. Several pockets (or 'strips') are spot-welded together to make a plate. Between each stage, the components are held in metal ammunition boxes, because cadmium is toxic. The computer system was able to increase production throughput considerably. Com- puter modelling of the factory identified one area of production as being the key step. Any delays at this step would hold up all the subsequent manufacture. This stage is where the two strips are brought together and filled. In reality, strip-filling was limited by another process, far more humdrum. The bottleneck turned out to be the spot welding stage, although no-one had realised this until the computer model made this obvi- ous. Spot-welding is a relatively unskilled operation compared with the strip filling and should not have been a constraint. Once identified, the welders were better trained and a few more added: now, strip filling really is the critical process. It even made more space on the shop floor. The ammunition boxes between the strip filling stage and the welding used to be a wall several feet high. Indeed, it was diffi- cult to even move around that area, for the piles of metal boxes. Now there are just a few on largely empty pallets - a triumph for the system. Mr Spyer also pointed out that the space freed by reducing the work in progress has given them room to build three new offices. Component count was reduced and many common assembly errors eliminated as a direct result of the planning associated with the system. The team had identified that they had 30,000 components used to make batteries. Most of these were simply minor variations on standard components. By rationalising the designs they were able to eliminate 17,000 components. Although there was no great cost saving in the purchasing side (since they were all small volume), there were great savings in the shop loading. There were also spin-off cost benefits in reducing the component range. Alcad manu- factures largely from raw materials and buys the strip in with a variety of thick- nesses. They were using 8mm, 9mm, 10mm and 11mm strip in varying quantities. Hav- ing identified that they could standardise on 9mm strip, it was felt that they could then increase the volume and get a discount from the strip supplier. When Mr Doisneau approached the sup- plier, he was told that there were no real discounts available, but was asked if Alcad really need the strip to be 9mm? If they could take 9.3mm strip, then the supplier could give them a discount as it was cheaper to produce. A quick consultation with design confirmed that it would be acceptable and Alcad saved money and increased performance. Part of the success of the system relies on the staff trusting it. The output of the OPT system is a set of schedules for every stage of the manufacturing process. These specify, on a daily basis, the exact type and quantity of items to be produced. \"They key message is: the schedules are realistic, therefore they create accountabil- ity,\" comments Mr Spyer. Often the schedules might seem counter- intuitive to the productkm staff For exam- ple, to minimise set-up time, it may seem more logical to make 1MM00 potive polaes fobowed by 14000 negative plates. However, Contilne O and page Continued from previous page no cells can be assembled until both plates are available. The OPT system specifies the optimum pattern of assembly, allowing for set-up times and other considerations. These \"achievable\" schedules still demand sensible management. \"We need discipline as \"downstream\" throughput depends on \"upstream\" pressures and levers\" explains Mr Doisneau. This meant reinforced supervision, and assigning responsibilities of control and reporting like a military organisation. \"We have demoted 20 chargehands, and created 10 supervisors,\" adds Mr Doisneau. The planning and modelling also highlighted management issues. Mr Spyer described one production supervisor as a \"squirrel.\" OPT estimated that he should have about five tons of material in reserve. He actually had 70 tons! (See- \"Beware of the squirrel,\" p.21). Traditionally it would not have been seen as stock but work in progress and would not have been visible to management as a problem. Marina Burfitt, the company secretary, saw the benefits of the system in terms of the change in management style. Previously the computers were \"run purely for the finance department.\" Twice-annual missives have been replaced by regular briefings. Like many companies, Alcad does have problems with incompatible computer systems. The OPT is run on an IBM system at Timegate, but their accounts are prepared on their parent company's Prime system. Their own stock is held on an in-house IBM AS/400 and they have a number of PCs.

As a result, it has more efficient manufacture and much better control. \"A lot of the misconceptions were about constraints\" says Mr Doisneau. \"The system changed my idea of real constraants. We used to pus, now we pulk we have se tegtion fewer staes, an im noted layout.\" \"We've become internally competitive, too\" adds My Spyer. \"Fingers now get pointed, and if a storeman has a difficulty with supply, he goes and bends the ear of the supplier via me - or takes it up with goods inwards.\" Recenatly, a supplier failed to deliver an Hieortant co oeomt.

It comes from an area where most reckoned that It would not exceed 60 per cnt. In fact it only dipped below 60 per cent twice In that period. One measure o the remarkable success achieved was when a production supervisor apologised that they had \"only reached 96 per cent adherence tht week.\" items for stock and to shuffle forward an number of other items. They could choose whether to lay staff off and decided against it. The OPT system could not prevent the problem but it did let the managers decide what to do about it. Involvement of staff at all levels has also spread the philosophy and made change easier to accept. Mr Dolsneau is the man identified as driving the system: \"I see it as my business to do that. It has got to be driven, and believed, frum the top.\" He has now turned his attention towards using the system to improve customer satisfaction. As he points out, the delays are now due to \"back-end\" processes such as shipping, rather than in the manufacturing He wants to extend the OPT system into these areas. He is also looking at the long-term aspects of purchasing, recognising that the iproduct lead time is the sum of Alcad's lea- time plus that of their suppliers.

   "text_content" : "THE PHONE rings: it is a customer wanting to place an order at a bottled drinks depot. A clerk calls up a form on her computer terminal and starts, line by line, to fill in the details of the customer's order. The request is extensive and runs to more than one screenful. What happens next could end up being against the law when an EC directive cover- ing software design comes into effect at the end of next year. As the clerk attempts to call up a fresh page on which to continue the order, she nits the right key - but in the wrong shift. Instead of getting the next page she has cleared the screen and then assumes that the order has been lost - in fact, the sys- tem still holds the first page of the order. The end result is that part of the order is duplicated and the mistake is spotted only when a double dose of the drinks are deliv ered. As well as costing the company money, the mistake has done little to enhance job satisfaction and much to increase stress for that particular order clerk. It is this last point that has drawn the issue of software design into the scope of the EC's directive on minimum health and safety requirements for work with display screen equipment, published in May last year. The directive will have to be incorpo- rated into member states' domestic legisla- lion by the end of next year - in the UK this is likely to mean new regulations under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, plus a detailed guidance document from the Health and Safety Executive. Consultation papers will be published by HSE over the coming months. In the example of the drinks order clerk, the software was arguably \"not suitable for the task\" under the directive (see box). Logi cally - that is according to computer logic - there was every reason why \"next page\" was closely related to the \"clear screen\" instruction. From the user's point of view it was almost inevitable that she would hit the key in the wrong shift from time to time and then suppose that the information had been lost. The new regulations will mean that employers as well as software suppliers will be obliged for the first time to think through users' requirements, says Mr Tom Stewart, a specialist in ergonomics and com- puters. The bottled drinks mix-up is a real example of poor software design from the fles of his London-based consultancy, Sys- em Concepts. Says Mr Stewart: \"Any system where pec ple's mistakes are critical - and yet where it's quite likely they're going to make mis- takes - is a bad match for the task. Think- ing about the user is something that hap- pens way down the line. The whole point about designing user interfaces is that you need to design with the user in mind, and then test properly.\" Going to the opposite extreme with user- involvement and ending up with specifica- tions for a system that is unbuildable is also a danger, points out Mr Stewart: \"It's quite hard to balance that process.\" The second requirement of the EC direc- tive, that software must be \"easy to use,\" is close to meaningless, says Mr Stewart, but should be interpreted, broadly, as underlin- ing the fact that it should be suitable for the task - that software should involve an appropriate degree of effort in relation to the benefit By being \"adaptable to the oper- ator's level of knowledge or experience\" software should, ideally, treat you like a novice when you are one and, when you become more expert, allow you, for example, to take short cuts through the menu system. Tacked on to this requirement is an What the EC directiv says about software ergonomics * The operatorlcomputer Interface: in designing, selecting, commissioning and modifying software, and in design- ing tasks using display screen equip- ment, the employer shall take into account the following principles: (a) Software must be suitable for the task. (b) Software must be easy to use and, where appropriate, adaptable to the operator's level of knowledge or experi- ence; no quantitative or qualitative checking facility may be used without the knowledge of the workers. (c) Systems must provide feedback to workers on their performance. (d) Systems must display information in a format and at a pace which are adapted to operators. (e) The principles of software ergonom- ics must be applied, in particular to human data processing. entirely different point there should be no checking of an operator's work through the computer system without the operator's knowledge. What have been called in the past \"clandestine tell-tale devices\" are opposed strongly in Europe by trade unions. Mr Stewart uses an example of a high-vol- ume data entry environment to demonstrate how stressful for the workforce such check- ing, even if it is not clandestine, can be: \"Something happens like the power going down and then a week later a supervisor comes up and says 'at 4 o'clock on Monday your keystrokes were down to 19 per cent of what they should be - pull your socks up.' That's monitoring used badly.\" The next provision on \"feedback to work- ers on their performance\" is an unfortunate- ly-phrased piece of Eurospeak which does not mean that software must be designed to send morale-boosting messages to workers at strategic intervals in the day. Says Mr Stewart: \"It means that the sys- tem should respond to you. It can be a great source of stress if you press a key, for example, and nothing happens. You don't know whether it's busy or you didn't press the key hard enough, so you press it again...then you've pressed it twice.\" The system should tell you if it is saving, think- ing, stuck or whatever, he points out. . As far as the requirement for displaying information in a format and at a pace adapted to the operator is concerned, there will need to be some sense of proportion applied to the way this is interpreted, stresses Mr Stewart. It cannot be expected that an off-the-shelf word-processing package costing Â£150 should be able to tell what level of typist the user is - on the other hand, it is quite clear that software designed, for example, for a nuclear power station, should be exactly adapted to operators. Finally, the EC directive requires that the \"principles of software ergonomics must be applied\" - a statement which could just as well replace most of the preceding clauses on software in the document. There are no 10 or 100 accepted rules of this relatively young science, says Mr Stewart. \"Ergonomics is about designing things to suit people; software ergonomics is about designing software to suit people. We have some knowledge about things like human short-term memory capacity and how people perceive images. \"If you're laying out a display, for exam- ple, we know that if you put things close together people see them as related. You don't use colours that confuse people - you use colour coding to support things. If you're going to use abbreviations you use ones that are meaningful,\" he stresses. Further information' The EC directive is aimed at employers but increasigly, soft- ware suppliers will be questioned by custom- ers on how well their products measure up to the new regulations. A number of workinrg groups are currently drawing up standards on hIumanomputer interaction. A comprehensive guide compiled by Tom Stewart is provided free by the Department of Trade and Industry as part of its Useability Now programme: Directory of HCI Standanrd March 1991.",

   "text_content" : "IBC VEHICLES is a joint venture between motor manufacturers General Motors (60 per cent) and Isum (40 per cent), which sped- alises in building light commercial vehicles. IBC's new four-wheel drive Frontera is already rolling off the production line at Luton, Beds. It is due to be launched in the UK and in ten other European countries in October. The company is best-known in the UK for its Rascal Midi light commercial vans, writes CaIre Goodgir IBC is using -the Data 3 software from Hoskyns, which it chose after a speedy but thorough evaluation in 1987. \"We had a time constraint of about 11 months,\" explains Mr Keith Devo, business systems manager at IBC Luton. \"We had a list of 40 items which came into the 'must have' category, and another 30 or 40 'desir- able' items. We had to implement by 1988, and \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t so were keen to find a proven MRP H sys- tem.\" Among the requirements were the need for a master scheduling module, barcodes, and explosion of manufacturing and scheduling information to satisfy Just In Time tech- niques (se mwna(bcturin sothawre erplain ae 168 Not many saoftware packages satisfied these criteria in 98. Of those available, IBC locked at systems based on IBM's mkrange AS400 computer, DEC's Vax computer, and IHew- let-Packard minicomputers. The Data 3 saft- ware won IBC's confidence because of its close fit to its detailed requirements, and its screen design; the user interface eased the eBort in training the many Data 3 users. \"Any package we chose needed to fit in with General Motrs\" says Mr Devo, \"but another reasn was the kmg-term support and service on ffer, and I must say the supplier has kept up to standard theme.\" There have been some modifications and extenswms to the package since im mnta tion 18 months ago, particularly in the front- end screens. IBC has tracked the benellts of the system carefuly, and Mr Devo reports a significant reduction in the costs. The data processing costs associated with manufacturing each vehicle have dropped from Â£110 per vehicle to 26 over the last three years The voiume has doubled, and the flow of processing improved sitce the factory switched fom batch data processing to realtime interactive entry and reporting of data. Turnover has gone up, and inventory improved. One lofnicant beneft, in common with many companies which invest in software pnkags for manufacturinghm is a saving in frespace. What IBC has saved in money and space terms has been invested in a computer aided design (CAD) system, which now replaces the rows and rows of cabinets which used to store the design drawings. Speciicaties: Sowarwe package Data 3 Supplier Hoskyns Insght Hardware-BM System 38 Hardware cost Â£27oIom Software cot: Â£100,000 for Data 3 package, and a uthber Â£100,000 on tailoring and consultancy. * Pictured above: information is barooded into the Data 3 system on the Vauxhal Frin- tar pronducion line at Latmn.",

   "text_content" : "DAVID GOLDMAN, pictured right, has just completed perhaps the most eventful nine months to date in the still short history of the publicly-quoted computer software com- pany, Sage Group, writes Rhys David. Earlier this year the group was credited by market researcher, Romtec, with a 55 per cent share of the UK packaged accounting software market and following the purchase in March ofDacEasy - a mirror-image com- pany in the US - it now claims also to be \"number one\" in unit package sales world- wide. This summer the company, which in the past 10 years has grown to employ more than 300 people, moved into a n3m new purpose-built headquarters in Newcastle-up- on-Tyne, and yesterday it won the expan- sion category in the Venturer of the Year Award, sponsored by Cartier the Jewellers and the British Venture Capital Association, in conjunction with the Financial Times. The company's initial success was founded on the development of low-priced, easy-touse accounting packages for small businesses, a sector which grew rapidly in the mid-late S19es with the explosion in use of personal computers. \"At the time, most of the software avail- able for these users was sawnoff versions of the mainframe equivalent We were able to come up with fresh ideas,\" David Goldman states. Since its earliest days, the company has expanded into other parts of the accounting software market and into net- work products. In addition, more than a third of revenues are now coming from non- software areas, such as computer stationery, software maintenance and trainhin. Very strong emphasis throughout the company's history has been placed on mar- keting, Goldman's oridginal area of exper- tise.The company advertises its branded products extensively and maintains an impreslive clent database gathered through its after-sales customer support scheme. Goldman's marketing skills have been balanced on the technical side by fellow founder Graham Wylie's technical brilliance - \"Graham has a strong 'market feel' and a gift for translating ideas into products the market wants,\" says Goldman. The Venturer award was made to the company in recognition both of its strong and continuing growth - at the interim stage profits before tax this year were up a remarkable 29 per cent on sales up 17 per cent at Â£7.m - and of the high return made to the investors, Grosvenor Develop- ment Capital since its initial investment in 1984. The company was floated on the stock exchange with a market capitalisation of Â£2man.In 1M9S, a valuation that has since gmrwn to more than fSo.

   "text_content" : "SUN MICROSYSTEMS, the fast-growing US workstation manufacturer, recently announced new operating software for busi- ness computers which it hopes to establish as an industry standard. Its announcement raised the temperature of the \"Unix wars,\" which have divided the global computer industry. It also marks a long-anticipated attempt by Sun to broaden its market beyond the traditional scientific workstation area to personal computers and the business desktop, writes Alan Cme. International Computers (ICL), the UK- based subsidiary of the Japanese Fujitsu company, has collaborated with Sun's soft- ware division, SunSoft, in the development of the new software, called \"Solaris\". Other computer companies which endorse Sun's initiative include CompuAdd, Sol- bourne, Tatung and Toshiba. Software com- panies which have agreed to develop pro- grams to run under Solaris include Lotus Development, Oracle, Word Perfect and Soft- ware AG. A standard operating system for small and medium-sized computers offers users lower costs and the ability to connect com- puters from different manufacturers together in networks. Unix, developed by AT&T, has emerged as the operating system of choice, with about 10m users worldwide, but each manufac- turer has developed a separate version, destroying hopes so far of a world standard. The industry is now polarised around two groups of Unix developers, Unix Interna- tional which includes Sun and ICL and the Open Software Foundation (OSS), including International Business Machines, the world's largest computer company. OSS has recently completed its own version of Unix, OSS1, but the picture is confused by the existence of IBMs Unix offering, AIX.",
