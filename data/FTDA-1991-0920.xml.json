   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Belgrade, Judy Dempsey in Zagreb, David Gardner and Ronald van de Krol in the Hague THE Yugoslav army was last night preparing for a new mili- tary offensive against Croatia as the European Community ruled out dispatching a peace- keeping force to the strife-torn republic. Hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, trucks and much heavy equip- ment rolled through Belgrade yesterday and headed towards Croatia, cheered on by Serbian bystanders. The destination of the mili- tary column was not known but some feared it might be an attempt to cut off the eastern region Slavonija from the rest of Croatia, others that it was a push on the Croatian capital of Zagreb. In an emotional interview with the BBC, Mr Zvonimir Separovic, the Croatian foreign minister, said: \"This time it's an open attack. It's full aggres- sion against Croatia.\" Earlier, the Serb-dominated federal army ordered a mass mobilisation in the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, parts of central Serbia and in Montenegro, a close ally of Serbia. Hundreds of men of military age went into hiding after night visits by military police to round up reservists. The new military deploy- ment came as the UK blocked a move by the Dutch presidency of the EC to send a peacekeep- ing force under the aegis of the Western European Union, the defeice grouping of nine EC member states. In a communiqud after a meeting in the Hague of EC foreign ministers and WEU defence ministers, it was agreed that \"no military inter- vention is contemplated\". It was also agreed that the \"WEU explores ways in which the activities of the (EC) moni- tors could be supported so as to make their work a more effective contribution to the peacekeeping effort\". The decision to hold back on any overt military commit- ment is bound to disappoint Croatia, which earlier yester- day appealed to the EC to send not only a peacekeeping but a peacemaking force \"to stand as a buffer\" against Serbian and Federal Army forces. Earlier, at the EC-sponsored peace conference in The Hague attended by the foreign minis- ters of the six Yugoslav repub- lics, and chaired by Britain's Lord Carrington, Serbia cate- gorically rejected any sugges- tion of a European force. \"To send troops into a coun- try without its agreement, that's not a peacekeeping force, that's an invasion,\" said Mr Vladimir Jovanovic, Serb- la's foreign minister. Yesterday the peace confer- ence itself was put on hold for a week in the hope that the warring factions implement the ceasefire signed on Tues- day. The ceasefire was sup- posed to have gone into effect on Wednesday, but the Yugo- slav news agency Tanjug said hand-to-hand fighting had again erupted in Gospic in southern Croatia. It said the Yugoslav army, backed by air force jets, was Croatia pledges to keep up pressure...........................Page 2 Macedonia fear................Page 2 involved in heavy fighting with Croatian forces for con- trol of a bridge in the southern port of Sibenik. Fighting also broke out in central and east- ern Croatia. After being outgunned for weeks, the Croatian forces have confiscated w.apons from besieged federal barracks and stepped up their own attacks on Yugoslav forces. The Cro- atian government claimed another victory against the fed- eral army after the republic's national guard forced the sur- render of a military barracks in Varazdin, north of Zagreb. Croatian officials in Zagreb said they thought the federal army was planning retaliation after a string of successful offensives by Croatia's defence forces over the past three days. At yesterday's EC meeting, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, insisted that the EC could not launch into a mili- tary effort simply because its political and diplomatic strat- egy was not working. Earlier, Germany and France had said the EC should seek a United Nations mandate for a WEU peacekeeping force in a joint statement issued after a meeting in Bonn between Ger man chancellor Helmut Kohl and French president Frangols Mitterrand. The two leaders proposed that an effective ceasefire moan- itoring system should include the creation of a buffer zone, as Continued on Page 18 Fresh offensive: Yugoslav tanks roll through Belgrade towards Croatia Croatia Coatinued from Poe 1 well as the dispatch of a peace- keeping force They also stipu- latem that such action by the WEU countries should receive epicit support from the 35na- tflon Conference on Security and Coouperatin in Europe.

   "text_content" : "IBy Philip Stephe, Political Editor THE Bank of England sought to retreat from the political battlefield yesterday as the Conservative and Labour par- ties unleashed further barrages in their pre-election phoney war. A renewed attempt by Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, to stress that the government is not commit- ted to an election this year did little to reduce the intensity of the exchanges. Mr Patten's comment that an election campaign was \"Some way oc\" was accompanied by the launch of a new Tory magazine outlinitng Mr John Major's programme for the 1990s and attacking Po ell ..............................

Most remained firmly in favour of delay until 1982, but Mr Major would be paying close attention to the signs arising frmfo iniok polls to be publisbed at OKweekend and early next week, he added. The Conservatives' cam- paign was reinforced last night bya party political broadcast designed to strengthen their appeal to the bluecoUlar, or C2, voters who will be crucial in deciding the election outcomne. That in turn will be followed this morning by the launch of a nationwide poster campaign attacking the oppoiution. Mr Robin Ldgh-Pem~be~tem the Bank governor, faced oppo sition criticism after a speech OgAAAP98P~1 S Bank seeks retreat from phoney war continued from page i earlier this week in which he indicated that the economic recession was ending. Senior Labour figures accused him of deliberately handing ammunition to the Conservative party, claiming that his optimism ignored the Bank's own judgment last month that the economy was \"bumping along the bottom\". Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the frontbench spokeswoman on corporate affairs, released a survey of gloomy statements from company chairmen to counter Mr Leigh-Pemberton's optimism. The Bank stressed, however, that the speech, which taken as a whole was not totally opti- mistic about the outlook, merely commented on the more encouraging signs seen since its last,assessment. Labour continued to push the political debate on to the social agenda, deriding govern- ment i claims that health ser- vice waiting lists had been shortened and detailing the personal costs of sharply rising unemployment.

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey In Zagreb WHEN the bells tolled six o'clock yesterday evening, Zarko BolIjkovac called it a day. It is early for him to be going home. In these warm evenings, the last of the long, hot summer months, Zarko, who operates a private chaufnt- fear service, should be driving tourists around the city. The tourists are long gone, and, if there were any left in Zagreb yesterday, the news that a massive federal army convoy had left Belgrade for Croatia would have sent them surrying home. Last summer Zarko was earning about Â£600 a month. This year, he may give up his job, as he can no longer make ends meet. GThis war, or whatever you want to call it, is crippling my business,\" he explained. His car was parked up against a stack of sandbags used to block access to the capital's coal cellars. \"There are no tourists. Only you lot. The journalists. And I don't want to drive any of you into danger zones,\" he added. Like many other car owners in Zagreb, Zarko has masked the headlights of his Mercedes with brown tape. Once dark- ness descends on the capital a blackout is in force in case fed- oral army jets strike at the city's main targets. This is the time of year when the schools and universi- ties are due to reopen. Some of Zarko's friends have refused to send their children back to school Husbands living in trouble- spots in eastern and southern Croatia have sent their wives and children to neighbouring Hungary, or to Austria.

   "text_content" : "By David Owen THE LABOUR party is pre- pared to adopt statutory mea- sures enforcing minimum stan- dards in the way UK compa- nies are run. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's City spokeswoman, said a Labour government would opt for legislation only if a committee of senior industry and City leaders which is re- viewing fundamental aspects of corporate governance failed to propose a means to ensure its recommendations were implemented. The committee is chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, former chairman of the confec- tionery and soft-drinks group Cadbury Schweppes. Ms Mowlam said Labour would take a statutory approach \"more in sorrow than in anger\". She added: \"The central question is how you get the bad companies to adopt the best practices.\" In presenting Labour's views to Sir Adrian at a meeting this week, Ms Mowlam expressed the party's dissatisfaction at the narrowness of the commit- tee's remit. Sir Adrian has said the main aim of the body, which has Department of Trade and Industry backing, is to produce recommendations which would be acted upon. The changes Labour believes are necessary include: * Disclosure of shareholder voting behaviour in takeover bids to discourage passivity among investment institutions. Publication of the names of institutions which did not vote on important issues would encourage a more intervention- ist approach among company owners, the party believes. * The opportunity for share- holders to vote separately at annual general meetings on payments to directors and political contributions. * Forcing companies to dis- close their criteria for appoint- ing non-executive directors to help shareholders to evaluate whether such appointees are genuinely independent. * Non-executives should form the majority on internal audit and remuneration committees. * Standards of disclosure and presentation in annual reports should be improved. The party cites the US Securities & Exchange Commission's form 10K as one possible model. * The method of dissemina- tion of Information gleaned by investment analysts who are in regular contact with compa- nies should be examined.",

Soviet and Russian power strictures-are sliding deeper iito'chaos, as political and eco- p6mic leaders warned yister- ay- oinstability, ~financla1 col- lawlessness SYi dtdn, the Rus- si pe remained con- filed dwith what was said to be a slight heart ail- ment. Meanwhile- the acting chairman the Russian par- liaient, Mr Ruslan Khasbul- atov, warned deputies that fail- ure to arrest a fall in living standards could prompt politi- cal dangers and even a second coup. Russia, he said, had passed a crisis in its relations with other republics - but \"you should not have any illusions or ignore the dangers of the union's disintegration\". He sought to head off criti- cism from deputies who queued up during the debate to attack Mr Yeltsin for strength- ening his executive powers at the expense of the legislature, saying that \"squabbling\" in parliament could open the way Mr Sumo Edamura, Japanese ambassador to Moscow, said yesterday the dispute over the Kurile isliads was a \"great anachronim\", writes Neiuckley Moscow. \"We must not leave it to future ertosto ete territorial probleimsn, our generation muast them out,\" he said. Mr Edamura said recent even ad etablid 4 new climate for negotiations, and beled it was poble to \"take relations between the tw csuntries onto a higher level.\" to a second putsch. He warned of forces threat- ening the fragile new struc- tures. Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian cen- tral bank, took up Mr Khasbul- atov's theme when he accused the new Russian commercial banks of engaging in criminal activity, or acting as fronts for Communist party money \"laundering\". Mr Matiukhin - himself under heavy criticism from business leaders, including commercial bank directors - said that now banks had to produce western style balance sheets and submit to examina- tion by inspectors they were finding \"criminal behaviour on a large scale, and some are involved in moving huge sums of money out of the country for the Communist party\". The sums involved, he said, ran into \"billions of dollars\". These structures were now very powerful, and were chal- lenging the democratic forces for power. \"If we do not regu- late them, they will be able to choose governments from their own number,\" he said. The alienation between the business class and the political leadership is now pronounced - with many business leaders joining the radical deputies In alleging that the Russian gov- ernment is seeking to perpetu- ate the command system.

   "article_dc_title" : "Moscow Asks West for $15bn Food Aid",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Brussels MOSCOW is asking the west to provide finance - In grants or guaranteed credit - for all the $14.7bn of food it estimates the Soviet Union will need to buy abroad in 1991-2. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, deputy head of the national economic committee that is in charge of the country, yesterday told EC officials that the $7bn food aid which Moscow is seeking from Brussels is only half the total wanted. Mr Luzhkov, who went on to London to see Prime Minister John Major, chairman of the Group of Seven industrialised coun- tries, said he hoped for national contribu- tons, from EC and other western govern- ments, amounting to a further $7.7bn in food aid. Soviet food imports averaged about $8-9bn a year, the officials said, but in the coming year they would need to buy abroad $14.7bn of food, because of this summer's poorer harvest and of hoarding of stocks by farmers. Moscow wants from the EC budget a straight grant of $2.16bn (Ecul.8bn), a three year loan of $2.4bn (repayable after 18 months and backed 100 per cent by a guarantee on the EC budget and a medium/long-term loan (repayable after five years). The EC has been struck by the contrast between the precision with which the Soviet authorities are laying out their financial requests, and the vagueness of detail surrounding the actual food situa- tion in the Soviet republics. Mr Luzhkov promised that individual republics would have a direct say in any aid programme. Brussels is sending a team of farm experts to the Soviet Union in the next few days. \"Until we hear from these experts, we will not be taking a position on requests either from the Union, or cities lke St Petersburg,\" the Commission said yesterday. St Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, has asked Brussels for 85,000 tonnes of food aid.

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Zagreb THE government of Croatia will continue to blockade fed- eral army barracks on its terri- tory until the army withdraws completely from the republic. This strategy, outlined yes- terday by Mr Mario Nobilo, for- eign policy adviser to President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, seeks to break the links between the army and Serb militants in Croatia. The republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Hercego- vina have repeatedly accused the federal army of backing Serbia, whose aim is to carve a greater Serbia out of the repub- lic of Croatia. Mr Nobilo said that until Croatia succeeds in expelling federal troops, and as long as there is war in Croatia, \"we will have no peace conference.\" Mr Nobilo has no doubts that this policy could provoke or humiliate the federal army into staging a fresh offensive. \"But we are prepared to pay the price,\" he said. He also believed that the fed- eral army would not launch a full-scale attack on Zagreb. \"The army will not do this because it could force the EC to organise, and send in a peace-keeping force. The army does not want this. I now think the federal army is looking for some honourable way out of this mess,\" said Mr Nobilo. But yesterday Croatian radio reported fighting between fed- eral troops and the rtepublic's national guard at Vukovar, eastern Croatia, and at the western coastal port of Sibenik. Croatia's policy also means that hopes by the European Community of implementing any lasting ceasefire appear more remote than ever. \"If we respect the ceasefire, we would have to disarm, and withdraw our forces,\" commented Mr Nobilo. \"But an the forces, the army, and Serb militants must withdraw too.\" Mr Nobilo and his col- leagues, now clearly in a more confident mood than a month ago, are determined to pursue this strategy. This confidence stems from the belief among officials in Zagreb that the fed- eral army is rapidly disintegra- ting in Croatia. \"The federal army is losing soldiers and officers. These have to be replaced. The army has no chance of replenishing its ranks with reservists. Indeed, it is now calling up vol- unteers.\" This new-found public confi- dence, aimed at boosting morale which was flagging just two weeks ago, is confirmed hourly on the state-controlled radio and television which reports fresh victories by the Croatian National Guard. \"We control 70 per cent of the military bases now,\" said Mr Nobilo. The federal army has more than 100 garrisons, barracks and other facilities scattered throughout the republic. In Zagreb, the Croatian capi- tal, the National Guard is blockading the two remaining barracks held by the federal army. \"There are a couple of thousand men in there. We have given them a little water. We are trying to undermine the federal army in Croatia. We are succeeding,\" Mr Nobilo said. The government in Zagreb says it will not discriminate against any federal soldiers who surrender. It also says it will let them free and honour their pensions. \"We are adopt- ing a policy of divide and role,\" explained Mr Nobilo. \"We will psychologically pressurise the army. We have more weap- ons,\" he added. In the meantime, the Cro- atian government will con- tinue to pursue its political goal of seeking international recognition of its Indepen- dence.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Fresh Balkan Conflict Feared over Macedonia",
   "text_content" : "By Kerin Hope in Athens GREECE, prompted by fears of conflict along its northern bor- der, has invited the leaders of Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania for talks in Athens on Yugo- slavia's future. While international atten- tion is focused on the fighting in Croatia, potentially danger- ous cracks are appearing along the ethnic fault lines in the southern republic of Macedo- nia, which voted overwhelm- ingly for independence in a ref- erendum last week. Although the Macedonian government has assured the European Community it is in no hurry to implement this decision, the quickening pace of Yugoslav disintegration may force the issue. Mr Kiro Gligo- rov, the republic's reformist president, says Macedonia can- not remain part of a Yugoslav federation that does not include Slovenia or Croatia. Greek officials had wanted to hold the meeting this weekend, but its plan was scuppered when Bulgaria protested that no Macedonian representatives had been invited. Athens is 200 MI 0 ROMANIA YUGOSLAVIA Buchdest * Be a BULGARIA cedonia I I keen to head off a possible con- frontation over Macedonia between Serbia and Bulgarias which could threaten the southern republic's external frontiers. \"Yugoslavia must remain united even in the form of a loose federation, and the exist- ing geopolitical map must be maintained,\" a Greek official said. Landlocked Macedonia is the federation's most backward republic, contributing only 5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. Its economy has been hard hit by loss of income from travellers in tran- sit: German tourists heading for Greece, Turkish Gastarbe,- ter driving home on holiday, and Greek truckers who, until this summer, transported 40 per cent of exports to EC mar- kets through Yugoslavia. Doubts about the economic viability of an independent Macedonia are compounded by increasingly vociferous demands for self-determination from its Albanian minority. The Albanians, who make up 20 per cent of the republic's 2m population, mostly boycotted the referendum. This month President Slobo- dan Milosevic of Serbia told Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, that Macedo- nia would not be permitted to secede, implying that it would be absorbed, by force if neces- sary, into a Greater Serbia. Macedonia might then turn for protection to Bulgaria, where President Zelyu Zelev recently revived a traditional view that the Macedonians are in fact ethnic Bulgarians. The Sofia government's willingness to recognise an independent Macedonia is seen in Athens as a rebuff to both Serbia and Greece. Greece refuses to recognise Macedonia on grounds that seem thoroughly anachronis- tic, except in the context of the region's historic rivalries over territory. In the Greek view, a Slavic republic has no right to the name of the northern Greek kingdom made famous in antiquity by Alexander the Great. Even before the referendum, Greece officially ignored Mac- edonia's existence, fearing that with Serbian backing it would one day claim the modern Greek province of the same name. Now, however, the overrid- ing Greek worry is that if Serbia were to impose an eco- nomic blockade on Macedonia, thousands of impoverished ref- ugees would flood into Greece. Greek troops are already hold- ing military exercises along the northern border, amid reports that some units will remain as frontier guards.",

Mr elmat Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, replied sharply that Mr Joehlasen's views were not these of the majority of its 17- member council.

Slnce unification has raised the number of states by five, this would produce a Bundes- bank council of up to 26, -icluding perma-ent directors. The Bundesbank regards this - too unwieldy and has pro- posed only eight regional anks, which would mean sev- eral states sharing. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has proposed nine; the Bundes- bank has accepted this. Mr Jochimsen's letter was aimed at marshalling state opposition to this reduction, which has to be approved by the cabinet. Mr Kohl, however, was expected to support Mr Walgel's proposal.

   "article_dc_title" : "Germany Leads Car Sale Decline",
   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent NEW CAR sales in western Europe fell steeply by an esti- mated 13.3 per cent in August to 1.038m from 1.197m in the same month a year ago, chiefly as a result of a sharp drop in sales in Germany. In the first eight months western European new car sales were 2.8 per cent higher at an estimated 9.76m than in the same period a year ago (with eastern Germany included since currency union in July 1990). The fall in German sales marks an abrupt reversal of the spectacular increases recorded earlier this year. According to industry esti- mates German new car sales in August fell by 20.1 per cent to 200,000 from 251,000 a year ago, confirming industry fears that the spectacular surge in Ger- man demand would weaken in the final months of the year. Germany has been the driv- ing force in the western Euro- pean market this year. In the first eight months German new car sales at an estimated 3.14m, were 48.5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago, and Germany has accounted for one of every three new cars sold in western Europe this year. August sales in Germany fell following the end in July of a tax concession for cars equipped with catalytic con- verters, which have now largely become standard equip- ment. Also the distortion caused by German unification is diminishing as the surge in sales had already begun in August last year in the wake of monetary union in July. Excluding Germany, new car sales in the rest of western Europe in the first eight months at 6.6m were 10.3 per cent lower than a year ago. Overall in western Europe new car demand in August was lower in 11 markets and higher in six; in the first eight months sales were down in 10 out of 17 markets. The VW group has estab- lished a commanding lead ahead of the Fiat group of Italy, its closest rival, which has lost ground rapidly this year, not least in its home mar- ket. VW group increased sales volume in the first eight months by an estimated 11.8 per cent this year, giving it an estimated market share of 16.7 per cent against 15.3 per cent a year ago. The Fiat group's share has tumbled to 12.6 per cent from 14.3 per cent a year ago reflecting a 9.2 per cent drop in sales volume.

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw WORKERS at WSK Mielec, one of Poland's largest aircraft sac- tories, are bthreatening a pro- test strike aimed at persuad- ing LOT, the Polish state airline, to drop plans to pur- chase nine Boeing 737 aircraft. Ms Henryka Bochniarz, Poland's recently appointed trade and industry minister is to travel to Mielec, in the south-east of Poland, today to speak to Solidarity trade unionists there who have been occupying management build- ings since Monday. The protest comes after LOT signed a let- ter of Intent earlier this month to purchase aircraft worth more than $300m (Â£177.5m) from Boeing. The agreement superceded an earlier letter of intent with McDonnell Douglas for the delivery of nine MD-80 airliners, McDonnell Douglas's offer included a pledge to purchase about $80m worth of aircraft parts in Poland and explore the possibility of placing defence orders with Polish industry. This won it Solidar- ity's support In the tussle for the contract. Management in the aircraft industry as well as the defence establishment and the Indus- try Ministry had been in favour of McDonnell Douglas. The Boeing offer was only taken up when, at the begin- ning of August, LOT was given a free hand to choose a sup- plier. Boeing has said it would purchase some $30m worth of parts in Poland. LOT already has three long-range Boeing 767s and yesterday Mr Bronis- law Klimaszewski, the air- line's managing director said he was determined to complete the agreement for delivery of the nine 787s from the same company. Mielec, backed by other air- craft factories such as WSK Rzessow nearby, is demanding that the government take binding decisions on the future of the industry which is now on the verge of collapse. Solidarity in Rzeszow, where unemployment has already reached 12 per cent, has declared a strike alert and promised to escalate protests. The trade union wants gov- ernment pledges of financial support to permit a restructur- ing of those sections of the industry thought worth pres- erving. The factories have been badly hit by the collapse of the Soviet market",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Camegy in Jerusalem MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, yesterday issued a strong appeal to Pales- tinians to atten a planned Middle East peace conference, as both the Palestinian and Israeli camps signalled grow- ing disaffection with the US initiative. Statements from the Pales- tine Liberation Organisation and Israeli leaders suggested Mr Baker's six-month effort to achieve Arab-Israeli talks could yet break down over con- flicting Palestinian and Israeli suspicions that Washington is biased against them. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister said Washington's conduct threat- ened to \"push peace further away\". Mr Baker, speaking in Amman, said Palestinians had the most to lose if the confer- ence plan collapsed. \"I think it is going to be a long, long time before this bus ever comes by again,\" he said. At the same press confer- ence, King Hussein said the only alternative was disaster for the Palestinians and for the region. Mr Baker wants a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delega- tion to the talks. The two spoke out after Pal- estinian leaders from the occu- pied territories, who met Mr Baker earlier in the week in Jerusalem, failed to aper for more talks in Amman. A PLO spokesman in Tunis said such a meeting would be \"useless\" because Mr Baker'. assurances on terms for the - peace conference failed to meet the \"minimum legitimate rights\" of the Palestinians. The spokesman, Mr Jamil Hilal, said a meeting next week of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in- exile, could decide not to attend the conference. Such a decision would undoubtedly be met with relief by the Israeli government. Offi- cials stress that Israeli demands to veto the Palestin- ian delegation had yet to be satisfied. Israel's attitude stiffened fol- lowing US suggestions that $10bn of US loan guarantees Israel wants to help fund immi- gration would be tied to a freeze in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, director of Mr Shamir's office, said this was an \"impossible demand\". To emphasise the point, Mr Shamir visited a settlement in east Jerusalem last night.

   "text_content" : "By Stfan Wagstyl in Tokyo THE Japanese economy is slowing, according to figures published yesterday which prompted speculation of fur- ther cuts in interest rates. Weak capital spending helped hold back economic growth to just 0.5 per cent in real terms in the three months to June, compared with the first quarter of the year, according to a report by the Economic Planning Agency. The figure was lower than expected and considerably below the 2.75 per cent increase recorded in the first three months. The EPA said the economy was still growing healthily. This month it was due to beat the 57-month post-war growth record established in the 1960s. The government remains confident of its forecast of 3.8 per cent growth for the sinan- cial year to next March. But some private sector economists are voicing doubts. Mr Paul Summerville of Jardine Flem- ing, the securities company, said 3.1 per cent was more likely. Mr Yoichi Tazawa, an economist at Nomura Securi- ties, urged the central bank to cut interest rates soon. According to the EPA, domestic demand in April-June grew by 1 per cent compared with the first quarter, with a solid 1.8 per cent increase in personal consumption offset by a sharp 6.7 per cent fall in housing investment and a very slight decline in capital spend- ing- the first since 1988. External demand fell 0.5 per cent as export values declined with a strengthening yen. Compared with the same quarter in 1990, gross national product rose 4.9 per cent in real terms, led by an 8.0 per cent rise in capital spending, and a 4.4 per cent increase in public works spending. Con- sumption was up 2.6 per cent. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan announced the money supply last month grew by just 2.8 per cent year-on-year, the lowest figure on record. Land prices in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's largest cities, dropped in the year to the end of June for the first time since the National Land Agency began its annual sur- veys in 1975, writes Steven Butler from Tokyo. The agency said yesterday that residential land prices in Osaka fell by 15.3 per cent, following a 48.2 per cent rise the year before. Commercial land prices fell by 8.9 per cent after rising 39.7 per cent a year ago. The decline in property values follows a period of high interest rates and a determined effort by the gov- ernment to force speculators out of the market. In Tokyo all residential decline in value, averaging 1 per cent, following last year's rise of 11 per cent.",

I The proposals, which have generated c intense controversy, would constitute a c breach in Japan's post-war ban on sending c troops on active service overseas. But gov- I eminent officials believe Japan has to play f a more active role in world affairs in t response to criticism of its failure to con- tribute personnel to the US-led coalition in the Gulf war. The government of Prime Minister Tosh- iki Kaifu, introduced similar bills a year ago, but was rebuffed by critics who claimed the move might infringe Japan's peace constitution. The current bills are unlikely to pass before parliament before this session ends on October 4, but they could be re-intro- duced in January. The ruling Liberal Dem- ocratic Party holds a majority in the lower house but not in the upper chamber so it faces a struggle to secure the support of the opposition. Opposition parties have various demands including a full explanation from Mr Kalfu about the constitutional implica- tions of the bills. Mr Misoji Sakamoto, the chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday that for Japan, which has made the UN a pillar of its foreign policy, it was increasingly impor- tant to enhance its contribution to peace- keeping and disaster relief operations. Mr Manfred WUrner, the Nato sec- retary-general who is visiting Tokyo, urged Japan to contribute more to sec- uring world stability. As the world's most successful economic power, Japan should \"take over a fair share of global responsi- bility\", said Mr Worner.",

   "text_content" : "Sally Bowen charts Lima's success in winning back the confidence of its financiers PERU'S signing on Wednesday of an agree- ment with the Inter- American Development Bank (IADB) for credit totalling $425m was the first fresh multi- lateral credit in five years. The loan is further evidence of Peru's success in winning back the confidence of the world financial community. Mr Enrique Iglesias, the IADB president, emphasised that this was the largest single credit ever granted by the bank. It was a sign of the lADB's \"great affection\" and admiration for the vigorous stabilisation programme under way in Peru,\" he said. The initial IADB credit will primarily support the external trade reQo=ms by Peru over the past year, against guarantees of no back- tracking on liberalisation. According to President Alberto Fujimori of Peru, more IADB money is in the pipeline including $300m to repair Peru's badly deteriorated roads. The IADB board approved in principle on June 30 the future finance of devel- opment projects in Peru total- ling over $1.6bn. After finalising $1.16bn for essential balance of payments support over this year and next from a \"support group\" of friendly countries, Peru won official IMF approval for its economic stabilisation pro- gramme on September 13. Peru's status of ineligibility for loans was immediately lifted. Then on Tuesday, in negotla- tions which President Fujimori described as \"fantastic and unprecedented\", Peru achieved the rescheduling of its entire $6.6bn external debt with the Paris Club group of leading industrialised nations. Peru's arrears make it the Paris Club's third largest debtor internationally and the largest in Latin America. Under the Paris Club's terms, Peru will pay nothing for the rest of 1991, and 1992 repayments have been cut to about $300m, less than half the expected figure. This will leave Peru with a net capital inflow of about 17oom next year. Unlike Poland and Egypt, which had a substantial por- tion of their arrears written off, Peru was unable to seek multilateral debt forgiveness from the Paris Club under con ditions imposed by Japan, the second largest support group member. However, Mr Carlos Bolona, Peru's economy minister and head of a newly constituted debt negotiation commission, said that Peru would \"make very great efforts at bilateral level to seek significant reduc- tions or debt swaps\" before returning to the Paris Club negotiating table in 198. Pern's strategy had com- bined the so-called Houston terms for middle-Income coEn- tries \"with elements of the Pol- ish negotiations,\" said Mr Bolona. As a result, the bulk of Peru's arrears with the club, comprising public sector debts, are to be rescheduled over 20 years with the remainder repayable over 15 years. Arrears exceeding $Ibn con- tracted after the cut-off date of January 1, 1968 have been res- cheduled for payment over a six-year period. These are con- sidered exceptionally favoura- ble conditions. Peruvian arrears with the IWF, meanwhile, are to be set- tled through the \"rights approach\". This will anow Peru to accumulate special drawing rights over the next two years without actual dis- bursement of funds provided that agrseed moetary target, monitored quarterly by the fund, are meL",

   "text_content" : "B~y Ironwen Mdd~oi THE PI'iFH Inspection team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, just arrived in Iraq, .will try to settle three questions about Iraq's nuclear weapons capability. Its main efforts will be to find the limits of Iraq's pro- gramme for enriching uranium by centrifuges. The surprise dislcovery by the fourth mis- sion, discussed at the IAEA governors' conference last week, was that Iraq possessed at least one highly sophisti- cated enrichment programme. * The technology to concen- trate the fissile form of ura- nium from less than 1 per cent of natural uranium to around 90 per cent is the main obstacle in making nuclear weapons. Centrifuges separate the iso- topes by spinning uranium in gaseous form. A linked cascade of 200 centrifuges would be needed for steady production of weapons-grade uranium. The IAEA inspectors have discovered a centrifuge produc- tion site at al-Farat, south of Baghdad, that is \"better than Eurenco\", the Dutch state-of- the-art centrifuge centre. The site, undetected before the Gulf war, escaped unbombed. The fifth mission needs to confirm its belief that al-Farat would have started operating by the end of 1991 and could have produced around 200 cen- trifuges a year. The al-Farat centrifuges would have over- taken electromagnetic enrich ment, a technology that Iraq had already developed. The IAEA team has concluded that electromagnetic enrichment alone could have delivered enough enriched uranium for a weapon within 18 months. The IAEA's second question is where the technology came from. While most of Iraq's experiments could have been drawn from open scientific lit- erature, the complexity of the centrifuge technology suggests outside advice. Mr David Kay, head of the IAEA teani, says \"it is most definitely part of our brief to identify people and companies behind the pro- gramme\". The third task is simply to find the outer limits of the huge Iraqi nuclear research programme - costing an esti- mated $10bn (Â£5.9bn) - which has so far been shown to encompass methods considered pioneering even in the west. The IAEA is unapologetic about its failure to discover the lavish programme in its past inspections of Iraq's nuclear reactors under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",

   "text_content" : "By Lara Marlowe in Beirut A LEBANESE kidnap group last night rejected reports that Mr Jackie Mann, the British hostage was about to be freed, and said there would be no further hostage releases until Israel liberated 20 more Arab prisoners. The Revolutionary Justice Organisation - believed to be part of the pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement - delivered the 32-line com- muniqud to Beirut's An Nahar' newspaper. The state- ment was authenticated by a photograph of US hostage Mr Joseph Cicippio. In the photograph Mr dcip- pio, 60, the deputy comptroller of the American University of Beirut who was kidnapped on September 12, 1986, was bearded but looking relaxed. The same group is known to be holding Mr Mann, a former British airline pilot. The 73-year-old wife of Mr Mann last night spoke of her \"shock and misery\" at news that her husband's release had been postponed. Mrs Sunnie Mann told Brit- ish television by telephone: \"I've waited and waited for so long and I pinned all my hopes on the release this time.\" Israel's release of 51 Arab prisoners and nine corpses on September 11 sparked a series of contradictory statements in Beirut on progress towards the freeing of nine western hostages still held in Lebanon. A communiqud issued by the same Revolutionary Jus- tice Organisation a week ago praised the Israeli move. Yet last night's statement said that the failure of UN media- tors to ensure that the terms of an accord were met \"placed the credibility of the negotia- tors at stake\". The group said At had been agreed that Israel would free80 Arabs. \"We have waited for some time for the number to be completed but agreements and promises do not mean any- thing to them (Israel) and guarantees through the UN have not been translated (into fact).\" On Wednesday the Iranian news agency IRNA reported from Beirut that the liberation of a western hostage - proba- bly Mr Mann, - would take place \"within hours\". The contradictory messages appear to indicate a disagree- ment between the kidnappers and their Iranian mentors.",

Some of the money realised will help finance UN operations to eliminate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The resolution, adopted by 13 votes to one (Cuba) with one abstention (Yemen), bypassed a proposal by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN official in charge of humani- tarian relief, that Iraq should be allowed to increase oil sales to $2.5bn. But it left open the possibility of a future increase. The sum agreed applies to an initial six-month period. The oil will go through the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline from Iraq to Turkey. UN inspectors will monitor ship- ments and the UN will receive payments for the oil into an escrow account. Lionel Barber adds from Wash- ington: The US was yesterday taking a \"wait and see\" approach towards Iraq amid continued diplomatic manoeu- wvring aimed at forcing Bagh- dad to grant access to its weapons sites.

   "text_content" : "By William Duliforce in Geneva THE NORDIC countries yesterday tabled a proposal for the liberalisation of maritime transport which they hope will remove, an important stumb- ling block to the completion of an international agreement on services in the Uruguay Round trade talks. Their move challenges the US to drop its opposition to having the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's most-fa- voured-nation (MFN) rule extended to shipping. Other participants in the Round, including the European Com- munity, are refusing to accept a General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) that exempts ^ ATT maritime services. Finland, Ice- land, Norway and Sweden pro- pose that Gatt's members adopt a \"common approach\" to maritime transport that would be binding on all parties to a Gats. Governments would under- take to impose no new restric- tive or trade-distorting mea- sures affecting international shipping services and to remove existing restrictions within three years of the agree- ment coming into force. Cabotage or coastal shipping regulations, under which most countries confine transport between two home ports to vessels carrying their own flags, would not be affected but would be negotiable. Govern- ments could agree between themselves to reduce or remove restrictions. Port facilities and auxiliary services would be dealt with in the same way. Countries would agree not to impose any new restrictions and could indepen- dently negotiate the removal of existing restraints. In the meantime, they would ensure access to auxiliary services for other countries' shippers \"on reasonable and nondiscrimina- tory terms\". Shipping conferences - the cartel-like mechanisms under which companies fix freight rates and co-orplinate services on most international routes - would not be touched; these are seen as private arrange- ments subject to national regu- lations on restrictive business practices, but not to trade agreements between govern- ments. The Nordic proposal takes no position in the conflict between governments, such as the US, which maintain that conferences should be open to new members and those, including the EC, which allow closed conferences to operate. Effectively, the Nordic pro- posal would require the US to accept the application of the MFN rule to all maritime ser- vices; countries could even ask Washington to negotiate on cabotage rights. US shipping companies have so far succeeded in prodding their administration into rejecting the application of the MF`N rule. They have argued that appli- cation would have a de-liberali- sing effect in that it would pre- vent the US from using its right under domestic legisla- tion to impose trade sanctions on countries it regarded as operating unfair shipping regimes. However, the Nordic proposal would ensure a fair measure of liberalisation within three years. Opposition to the Nordic pro- posal can be expected from developing countries. African negotiators quickly voiced con- cern about the effect the pro- posal would have on cargo- sharing agreements concluded under the United Nations liner code, which is designed to stimulate developing countries' share of world shipping. Under the code two coun- tries can decide to reserve 40 per cent each of the maritime trade between them for their own flag carriers, leaving 20 per cent for vessels from other nations.",

Mrs Hills, who like other US ofildals, has for yeaors pushed the EC to phase out its farm subsidies, stressed several times In a press briefing that EC should now be given the opportunity to proceed on internal reforms. However, that should be done as early as possible because the Community will be busy with political and monetary reform at the end of the year. A meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations before the end of the year on agriculture trade lib- eralisation is \"one option\", she said, as is the possibility of a meeting of the European Coun- cil on agriculture. However, it might be \"pre- mature\" to have the G-7 \"debate the round\" before the EC farm ministers agree on their own reforms. Mrs Hills dealt with a wide range of Issues at the briefing. SThe US will soon sign a \"framework\" trade agreement with Singapore, the first such pact of its kind in Asia. Similar agreements, setting out trade principles and an agenda for bilateral consulta- tions, have been concluded with 29 Latin American countries. The administration consid- ers such agreements the first step towards future free trade pacts. SThe US will definitely \"react\" to Canada's recent can- cellation of a 1986 agreement on lumber. The administration has already said it is considering all options, including imposi- tion of a US import tax to off- set Canadian lumber subsidies. * In the first market access talks for a North American Free Trade Agreement, the US proposed to phase out all its tariffs immediately; 6 per cent in the intermediate term and 50 per cent long term.",

The contract to build the 600MW power station, in Kelantan province near the Thai border, was awarded in March to Balfour Beatty and Cementation International, two UK construction companies, along with Kerjaya Sendirlan Berhad, a local contractor. The project is 90 per cent under- ground for environmental reasons. The Kelantan project took the two UK construction corn- panies two years to negotiate, and was won with the help of the British government's \"aid and trade provision\" - export credits sweetened by aid. In April, the success of the pro- gramme forced the Overseas Development Administration to close the window for new deals until the end of the cur- rent financial year. The size of GEC Alsthom's contract was not disclosed, but is understood to be substantial. It underlines the company's strong position in Far Eastern markets, although it is its first big Malaysian order since its formation in 1989. GEC Alsthom's Manchester- based power station projects group will design, procure, supply and project manage the , electrical and mechanical Sequipment package, provides I as part of a multi-million pound soft loan agreed Sbetween the UK and Malaysan governments. The loan will be Spart-financed from the ATP. The project comprises an underground powerhouse with a main chamber and trans- former hall, and a control building and switchyard on the surface. The main chamber will contain four vertical shaft generators manufactured by GEC Alsthom's large machines subsidiary in Rugby, directly coupled to four vertical shaft Francis-type water turbines. The station, due for comple- tion in 1996, will provide power during periods of short-term peak loading.",

On a visit to Washington, where he sought support for multilateral reform of anti- dumping rules in the Uruguay Round, Mr Nalsund said Nor- wegian companies had learned the hard way of the risks of building US market share. Nor- wegian salmon farmers in the last decade had gained a 70 per cent share of the US market for fresh salmon but the market had totally disappeared follow- ing the loss of an anti-dumping and subsidy case filed with the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission. In April, when the ITC deter- mined by a 3-1 vote that US fish farmers had been injured by the import of fresh salmon from Norway, anti-dumping duties of 23.8 per cent and a countervailing duty of 2.27 per cent were levied on the product. \"You have to have large resources to risk entering the US market,\" Mr Nalsund said. Norway has appealed to Gatt, where two panels are soon to hear the case. The costs of fighting the anti-dump- ing charges in the US and tak- ing the cases to the Gatt was costing \"millions\", Mr Nalsund said, which small governments can ill afford.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawmay, Political Correspondent THE GOVERNMENT has \"doctored\" the findings of a highly damaging independent report on six Third World aid projects, Labour said yester- day. The party said the analysis disclosed that the projects were of little development value and may have breached international free trade com- mitments. Ms Ann Clwyd, Labour aid spokeswoman, contrasted a version of the 1988 evaluation report, circulated within the Overseas Development Admin- istration (ODA), with the final document published in 1990. She said at least 13 serious crit- icisms of the six power-plant projects had been deleted. Three of the criticised projects came under the con- troversial Aid and Trade Provision (ATP), the Â£50m-a- year budget which has been criticised as a disguised sub- sidy for British commercial ventures of dubious develop- ment merit. Ms Clwyd said: \"The two documents appear to show that international bodies and parlia- ment have been deliberately misled to save the govern- ment's face.\" She added that all ODA internal reports should now be disclosed. The ATP has repeatedly been questioned by the devel- opment and assistance commit- tee of the Organisation for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Development (OBCD), which monitors aid programmes for possible breaches of trade agreements. It is also the sub- ject of an inquiry by the National Audit Office. The original report, entitled A Synthesis of Six Evaluations of ODA Large Power Genera- tion Schemes, tried to draw conclusions about the effective- ness of power plant projects in Bangladesh, Botswana, Burma, Sudan and India. Its authors, Mr Andrew Bar- nett of Sussex University's Sci- ence Policy Unit, and Mr Garth Armstrong, an ODA consul- tant, criticised appraisals and monitoring, \"problematic\" ten- dering processes, breaches of \"UK content\" rules, approval of inappropriate technologies and insufficient provisions for the operating and servicing of equipment. All those points were either deleted or toned down In the final version. It also removed an assess- ment that claims the three ATP schemes had involved \"a minimum test of development soundaess\", did not seem \"very meaningful\" and that, in one case, no such test had been carried out. Other deletions included a conclusion that Department of Trade and Industry appraisals were \"inadequate\", and con- tained \"unsubstantiated and, in the event, incorrect\" sales prospects for the companies involved. A highly critical annexe con- taining summaries of the eval- uations of each power project was dropped and the names of companies involved in the pro- jects had also been removed. The ODA last night denied any cover-up, adding that the 1988 report, made public by Labour, was an early draft. All the later changes had been made with the approval of the report's authors, while project planning was under continual appraisal to improve the qual- ity and value of aid schemes.",

   "text_content" : "By Edward Mormwr THE British government's method of financing disaster relief operations was criticised last night by Lord Judd, direc tor of the charity Oxfam. In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Lord Judd said the British army's role in helping Kurds and Bangladeshis earlier this year had been crucial in saving many lives. It might well \"be appropriate to use their special expertise and those of the other armed services in the futture\", particu larly where floods or other con- ditions made access difficult. He described as \"truly outra- geous\" the system by which the Ministry of Defence bills the Overseas Development Administration (which has a much smaller budget) for the cost of such operations. \"It is absurd that ODA should be recharged for the services pro- vided. Frequently service of this kind by the armed forces has a tremendous morale and training ignificance for those involved.\" Lord Judd, who as Mr Frank Judd was a foreign office min- ister in the last Labour govern- ment, also said that many deaths in the early days of the Kurdish emergency could have been prevented if there had been \"a UN supremo in the field with the direct personal authority of the secretary gen- eral, with access to experts, funds, buffer stocks of relief items\" and the authority to liaise with voluntary agencies and the Turkish government. He called on the UN Security Council, \"as the effective 'clout' of the international community when the will exists, to put humanitarian needs as firmly on its agenda as other political crises\", and in particular to take responsi- bility for people displaced by internal conflicts. At present, such people fall outside the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refu- gees, since refugees are defined as people forced to leave their country. As an example, Lord Judd cited 1.8m displaced peo- ple in Sudan who, he said, \"are being forcibly removed by the government to makeshift and inadequate holding camps\". The responsibility, he suggested, could be given either to the UNHCR or to a new deputy secretary general.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy THE Office of Fair Trading has decided not to refer the news- paper distribution industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in spite of some concern about restraints on competition. Some newsagents com- plained that the rationalisation of newspaper distribution had often led to a lack of choice of wholesaler for a title in a par- ticular area. In many cases, the switch from rail to road had been accompanied by the awarding of exclusive contracts to whole- salers on an area-by-area basis. That had led, newsagents said, to increases in carriage charges, the \"boxing-out\" - sending more copies than ordered - of some titles, and changes to supply conditions. Sir Gordon Borrie, director- general of fair trading, acknowledged yesterday that there were restraints 6n com- petition In the distribution of newspapers by publishers to wholesalers and by wholesal- ers to retailers. Nevertheless, the OFT decided the restraints contributed to wide and effi- cient distribution. Sir Gordon said. \"While par ticular wholesalers and retail- ers or potential retailers may find these restraints inhibiting, I can discover no reason for believing that there is any loss to the public sufficient to jus- tify a reference.\" He added that he continued to be concerned that there might be unregistered restric- tive agreements between news- paper wholesalers. Restrictive agreements have to be regis- tered, so that it can be decided whether they need to be con- sidered by the Restrictive Prac- tices Court. Sir Gordon's deci- sion was strongly criticised by the National Federation of Retail Newsagents. Mr Ken- neth Peters, federation chief executive, described Sir Gor- don's statement as a \"wholesal- ers' charter\". He added: \"There must be champagne corks pop- ping in every wholesale house up and down the land - bought with money screwed out of the retail newsagency trade.\" The federation has cam- paigned hard for an MMC inquiry into what it regards as restrictive practices among its newspaper suppliers. Sir Gor- don said he had placed one such agreement between wholesalers in the Blackpool and Preston area on the public register and was considering whether it should be taken to the court.",

The prospect of a dimin- ishing real resource over the next few years is of very great concern to the council, partcu- larly given the inexorable rise in me costs of front-line scien- tific research.\" Only 20 per cent of Sere's budget is devoted to its own laboratories. The remainder is spent on grants to university researchers and on subscrip- tions to international facilities, notably Cern, the nuclear physics laboratory in Geneva.",

He won't talk about the money.\" So he has somine shares then? \"He'd be a fool not to.\" The line went dead. At distilleries in the High- lands, on the islands of Jura and Islay and at the bottling plant in LWith, the 500people who work for Invergordon Dis- tillers are almost uniformly taciturn about discussing the big issue of the day, the fact that many of them stand to make enormous gains on their original outlay, and some to become seriously rich, if Whyte & Mackay succeeds in taking over their company. About three quarters of Invergordon employees have shares in the company, and with the directors account for 12 per cent of the equity. About 200 of them obtained their shares at an effective price of only 3.3p. After Whyte & Mackay offered 225p in cash for Inver- gordon shares early last month, the share price soared from 163p. On Wednesday it was 257p, down from the post- bid peak of 270p but still mak- ing senior managers worth more than Â£750,000 and putting the executive directors com- fortably into the millionaire bracket. The company, however, is fighting a determined battle to remain one of the few indepen- dent whisky companies. When Whyte & Mackay extended its offer until October 4 it had received acceptances for a deri- sory 27,000 shares, 0.02 per cent of the company. Those Invergordon staff who are prepared to talk about the bid insist on their loyalty to the company. Mr John Small, production manager at the bottling plant, said: \"We back the wisdom and judgment of the board.\" Other staff play down the personal gains they stand to make. One man in Leith said: \"Don't forget that we'd already made healthy gains before the big rise came along and very few of us had sold.\" Another explained: \"It's a cash-only offer and if it's accepted well be left with no shares in the company. That would make it a lot less inter- esting to work for.\" Whyte & Mackay is a subsidiary of the big US tobacco company Amer- ican Brands. The exceptional gains that employee and director share- holders in Invergordon stand to make are due partly to the company's rapid transition from a management buyout in 1988 - from controlling share- holder Hawker Siddeley - to a stock flotation in May last year. That was aided by fast- rising profits, caused by suc- Source of wealth: swan-neck copper suls at InvergorMons TuuiDarame azsuuery cessful policies and a climnbing whisky market. Dr Chris Greig, chief execu- tive, said. \"There was a sur- prising amount of interest in share ownership among our employees even when we were controlled by Hawker Siddeley. I had to tell them we didn't advise them to buy shares because it was a very narrow SMlviULy1m5 as 5a WI BULWAUWUU a market, but I've always wanted I large-scale employee share i ownership.\" Nearly half the company's employees live in the High- lands, most of them near the big grain distillery at Invergor- I don itself. \"A lot of them,\" he i explains, \"have their own I crofts in addition to working in the distilleries. It's typical of the Highlanders to want to be involved in ownership.\" The chance came in 1988, when Dr Greig and three other directors made their Â£93m management buy-out. Of the 600,000 Â£1 shares allocated to the company's staff, half went to the directors. The remainder were offered to employees. About 60 top managers were allowed to bid for amounts ranging from Â£2C00 worth up .toÂ£10,000 worth. Other employ ee with at least two years of vice could buy between Â£100 and Â£500 worth, depending on their position. About 42 per cent of employees took up the offer. When the company returned to the stock market in 1990, directors and employees were - offred 30 new shares for each old Â£1 share, a price of 3.p. The smallest employee share- holder found himself with 8,000 shares, which became worth Â£4,050 when Invergordon was floated at Â£1.35. Mr Geof Collyer, a whisky analyst with Edinburgh stock- brokers Bell Lawrie White, says that the allocation of shares at that time was the normal consequences of a suc- cessful management buy-out. \"No one complained at the time at what looked like a good deal for the employees,\" he says. \"Why it was so massively good I'm not quite sure.\" The fact that many people at Invergordon missed the boat by not subscribing to the man- agement buy-out did not put off others from buying shares in the flotation at Â£1.35. \"A lot came in at that time,\" says Dr Greig. Invergordon then insti- tuted a profit-sharing scheme for its employees which handed out its first shares this year. \"To my knowledge, very few staff have sold their shares,\" Before the bid the shares never got above Â£1.67. The Whyte & Mackay bid has made the investment of say, a distillery mashman who obtained the minimum alloca- tion in 1988, rise from Â£100 to almost Â£8,000. Those senior managers who were allocated Â£10,000 worth in the MBO have shares theoretically worth Â£800,000. As for the directors, Dr Greig's personal and family holdings would be worth almost Â£11m. Mr Edward Pick- ard, the finance director, was given options to buy 675,000 shares at 4.2p between 1993 and 1996 when he joined the com- pany last year. That will cost him Â£28,350 against a current value of Â£1.75m. One man in Leith quotes a Scottish proverb which runs: \"What's coming to you won't go past you.\" That seems to mean: if you're in luck you're in luck and you deserve it. The men of Invergordon are already in luck. Even if Whyte & Mackay or other possible bidders fail, analysts have re- rated the company on the basis of last week's interim profits and forecast and believe the share price is unlikely to be below Â£2. Staff might be tempted to cash in part of their holdings. But Dr Greig points out a sting in the tail. \"The govern- ment will want its share. Don't forget the 40 per cent capital gains tax.\"",

Some Jeremiahs, he said, were still hard at work preach- ing gloom and doom and argu- ing that tendering and other provisions in the Broadcasting Act \"would irredeemably com- promise the quality of British broadcasting\". Mr Baker told the Royal Television Society's Cambridge convention last night that \"the overall effect of the Broadcast- ing Act will be to improve the quality and audience appeal of the programming, and also improve creativity and encour- age the development of new Went\". The knowledge that ITV companies would have to bid to try to retain their franchises had led to painfu restructur- ing. That had happened with- out a reduction in quality. \"ITV's current success In the ratings bears witness to the fact that quality and efficiency are not mutually exclusive,\" Mr Baker said. He was speaking as the Inde- pendent Television Commis- sion readiched the final phase of deciding which of the 400 appli- cants would win the 16 com- mercial broadcasting licences. Mr Baker promised yester- day to produce a discussion document next year, setting out all the possible options for the future of the BBC, whose Royal Charter runs out in 1996. Mr Baker promised a rigor- ous examination that would include questions such as whether the BBC should con- tinue to provide the full range of programmes from \"soaps\" to the Proms. He acknowledged, and praised, the contribution of television news and current affairs in encouraging the progps to freedom in eastern Europe and in holding politi- deas to account. * The Ml' said yesterday it would not be announcindg the Channel 3 licence awards before the week October 14, but still to announce the result before the eind Of October.",

   "text_content" : "By PPolitical Editor MR John Major, the me to a . aan plank\\ in the Conservatives' platform for the 19908, And promised a ..ghter grip on ati a d gthe 19808. Writing in a'new magazine, Transforming Britain, pro- duced by Conservative Central Office, Mr Major ofered a pre- view of his party's general elec- tion manifesto. Nurturing the spirit of enterprise, he said, remained at the centre of the Conservative agenda. \"The best way to allow an economy to flourish is to stand back and give room for choice, competi- tion, incentive and the will to succeed.\" Mr Major wrote that support for individual enterprise would be coupled with a commitment to reward \"care and commit- ment\" and to restore pride in public services. The magazine is designed to contrast the results of 12 years of Tory gov- ernment with the \"economic failure and social disintegra- tion\" of the 19708. Mr Major identified defend- ing the peace and protecting personal security at ome and abroad as the starting point for Tory policies. He is determined also that Britain should remain at the heart of the debate on the future of Europe. On the economy, he said \"I intend to have a better record on inflation in the 1990s than either the 1970s and 1980s.\" A Conservative government would, he said, \"keep taxes low, leaving people as much as possible of their own money to spend\". There is no mention, how- ever, of the government's long-standing commitment to cut the basic rate of income tax through changes to the tax sys- tem - to encourage saving and personal pensions. He emphasised his enthusi- asm for further privatisation and for the \"tcontracterisation\" of many public-sectortasks to the rivate sector, but bal- a it with the promise in the Citizen's Charter to revive the tradition of \"services dedi- cated to high-quality perfor- mance\". A priority would be to \"enhance the opportunity soci- ety by raising the quality of our education and training\". Mr Major said the inevitable ageing of the population under- scores the need for flexibility \"in the way we handle retire- ment\". Nevertheless, a refer- ence in his article to the need for the government to be \"as generous as possible\" to those who rely entirely on state pen- sions brought Labour charges of a hidden agenda to limit eli- gibility for the basic pension. The prime minister con- cluded. \"Above all, I want to ensure that everyone is given the chance to play a full part in shaping a Britain noted throughout the world for its stability, prosperity and har- mony.\"",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent THE SCOTTISH National party was told ,yesterday that there were \"obvious parallels\" between Scotland and the three Baltic states; Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Mrs agarept Ewing,,parlia- mentary leader of the party, which wants an independent Scotland, acknowledged that the comparison could be over- stretched. \"The naked aggres- sion, the physical oppression and the murders of innocent civilians are far removed from our position.\" Yet the Baltic states had always been recognised as nation states. Their method of achieving independence had been democratic, they guaran- teed rights for minorities and they wanted to participate in the international community. The British establishment found those parallels \"difficult to understand - but probably does not wish to understand\". It \"trembled at the will of a people with the same imperial- istic fear as did the Kremlin\" at the will of the Baltic states. In a speech that received a standing ovation on the second day of the SNP annual confer- ence in Inverness, Mrs Ewing said she was angry that \"Scot- land is relegated to be an eavesdropper on the councils. of the world, to be a tartan waitress at the big boys' table\". Earlier, the conference backed a motion calling on the government to grant Western Isles council, which lost Â£23m in the closure of BCCI, the power to borrow to replace the lost money. Ms Frances MacFarlane, pro- spective SNP candidate for the Western Isles, said that the government had a moral responsibility to the council because BCCI had been approved by the Bank of England as creditworthy. The conference demanded the government should give an immediate amnesty to Scots who are required to pay the minimum 20 per cent of their poll tax. An amendment call- intag for an amnesty to all poll tax non-payers was defeated.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack THE magazine Transforming Britain may be on sale at news stands around the country, but its financial support is rooted firmly in Conservative Cen- tral Office in London. While the glossy, 68-page publica- tion preaches the virtues of the free market, revenues from its Â£1.95 cover price will probably need a substantial subsidy from the party's communica- tions budget. Mr Martin Graham, the deputy director of research who had the idea for the magazine, said: \"This is a graphic and accessible statement of the government's purposes for a wide audience. It gives our strategy, what we have achieved, and tells the younger generation what life was like under Labour.\" Unflattering newspaper cuttings from the 1970s and sepia photographs of pickets and uncollected rubbish on the streets dissolve into colour shots of industry at work and regenerated inner cities in the 1980s and 1990s. British Airways, in spite of recently cancelling its annual contribution to Conservative party funds, can enjoy a two-page shot of one of its aircraft taking off, symbolising the Tory pri- vatisation campaigns. Mr Chris Patten, party chairman, writing in the magazine, says: \"It is vital that we should be able to Illumi- nate the journey so far; and let the journey so far illuminate the future. For our work is not yet finished.\" The party faithful are expected to sell 25,000 copies of the magazine through constituencies. A further 55,000 will go to newsagents, and only if they all sell will the Â£90,000 produc- tion costs be recouped. There are only three advertise- ments in the publication, and prime slots on the back cover and inside- front and inside-back covers are blank. \"Our intention was political, not commercial,\" Mr Graham insisted. \"The project is a bit of a leap of faith, but I think we will sell most of the copies. If it works, we might well do other magazines in the future.\" The Labour party, which produced a mass-market glossy in 1986, was more sceptical \"There are more effec- tive methods of communication,\" a spokesman said. \"But it's the content we're concerned with, not the con- cet.\" t might pay opposition parties to read the magazine closely. Andersen Consulting, which paid Â£5,000 for its advertisement, emphasised that it did not support any political party and would be happy to fund similar adver- tisements in similar publications by the Liberal Democrats and Labour.",

Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, said that in the year to March 1991 the number of people in England waiting for more than two years for admission to hospital had been cut by 30,000, a reduction of 37 per cent. The number waiting more than a year had dropped by 38,000, or 18 per cent. Although there was a slight increase in the number waiting for day-case treatment compared with March 1990, that was more than offset by a reduction in the number waiting for hospital treatment, causing the overall total to fall by 12,700 to 900,100. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary claimed, how- ever, that figures he had acquired from the 14 regional health authorities for the year to June showed an increase in the overall total to 923,745. He said Mr Waldegrave knew that the cut in total numbers he had announced had been wiped out in the first quarter after the introduction of the NHS reforms. \"In the three months since March, waiting lists have been bounding up at the rate of over 1,000 extra patients a week,\" he said. The Department of Health said that the provional fig- ures for July showed the total number on the waiting list was 896,000 - about 25,000 fewer than Mr Cook's figures for June.",

Ms Lindi St Clair, the party's founder, says she has received a letter from Mr Russell prom- ising to direct a broadcast free of charge, subject to availabil- ity. Although Ms St Clair is not yet sure whether the party can afford the music it wants, it is hard to imagine the end prod- uct being anything other than rSo parties that have a dvewrs for so km with dreary\"monoogues an dry statistics now sing over themselves to lavish money and attention on production values and bgnamedirectors?

Yesterday's film was con- ceived in conjunction with a glossy 68-page magazine and a new poster offensive to be unveiled today. \"We have to make sure that when we fire a message, we do it on all cylinders,\" Mr Wood- ward says. Also seen as important, as viewers become more attuned to better production values, is ensuring that the message con- veyed is in step with the mood of the country at large. Yesterday's broadcast, for example, contained acknowl- edgements that \"transforming Britain\" has not always been easy . . . partly in deference to polls indicating that eco- nomic optimism is on the upswing but by no means soar- ing.",

   "text_content" : "By Vanessa Houlder f Covent Garden's flirtation with property development were made the subject of an opera, it would be comic, noisy and very long. For seven years, there have been been various denoue- ments, bizarre sub-plots and a wel- ter of passionate proposals and vehement rejections. While there has been more pos- turing than action, this may soon change. Last week, the Royal Opera House won planning consent for a small, preliminary scheme to move some changing rooms and replace them with offices, shops, a restau- rant and wine bar. When this scheme is completed next June, the hoped-for profits of Â£5m will provide funds for some improvements and pave the way for a Â£150m scheme embracing shops, offices and sweeping improvements to the opera house itself. Nonetheless the go-ahead for the present comparatively minor proj- ect is stirring strong emotions. Mr Dick Ensor, chief executive of the opera house's development project, bills it as \"a huge step forward - rather like putting a man on the moon\". The Covent Garden Community Association, which has consistently opposed commercial development, is sceptical. It believes that the opera house should aim for more modest improvements, which could then be financed by a public appeal. The community association fears that the opera house is starting a cycle of piecemeal development in which more and more projects will have to be undertaken in the hope that it can eventually raise enough cash to finance improvements to the building. \"It is a crazy approach, because it makes you reliant on external forces,\" says Mr Jim Monahan of the community association. \"One is not surprised when you have an opera house with a board littered with property developers,\" he adds. Though philosophical differences between developers, community and artists provide the basis of the plot of the Covent Garden \"opera\", it is overlaid with other strands: conservation, politics and the turbu- lent fortunes of the commercial property. market. It began in the early 1980s, when the opera house decided it had to TOTAL RETURN (%) Retail Office Indutrial All Properties Year to July 91 -3.0 -10.9 0.3 -5.6 Quarter to July 91 0.7 -2.2 2.0 -0.2 Month of July 91 0.1 -1.3 0.4 -0.4 Investment Property oatabanh F improve its Dickensian; facilities. F Pre-first world war submarine , engines were still being used to a raise the stage and sets were often e reassembled painstakingly by hand. i This added to the costs and meant . Covent Garden could not share s facilities with continental opera i houses. 1 By international standards, I opera-goers got a raw deal too. The i Crush Bar lived up to its name and i the amphitheatre was stiflingly hot 3 in summer. Covent Garden's prime problem t was raising the cash for improve- 1 ments. It could launch a public f appeal but the only other option ; seemed to be to build shops and i offices on land around the theatre. I In 1985, Mr Jeremy Dixon was . appointed as the architect to work i on the design, which won condi- r tional approval from Westminster SCity Council in 1987. , If Covent Garden thought it was : home and dry, it reckoned without Sthe Covent Garden Community 1 Association. This was formed in the 1970s to combat office development i in the area, which it thought would > drive out the existing vibrant mix Sos homes and businesses. Save Britain's Heritage and the Royal - Fine Art Commission were also crit- Sical of the opera house's plans. - Even the proposed improvements to the theatre were faulted for not pro- viding enough space for storage and . scenery. SMr Denis Vaughan, the conduc- * tor, lobbied vigorously for a Per- forming Arts Centre encompassing the opera house. The plan was to seek support for the scheme from a wealthy benefactor or through a national lottery. Covent Garden Community Asso- ciation took its case to court and lost. But the opera house was on the brink of gaining final approval from Westminster council in Febru- ary 1989, when it emerged that the opera house had been in contact with Tottingham's, an Ohio-based development company. The US developer proposed building a type of wild west theme park instead of offices. While the opera house denied taking these plans seriously Westminster council had become suspicious, because of a leaked suggestion that the opera house would try to make amendments after the plan was approved. It decided to delay its approval. The opera house submitted new plans, which were approved in May 1990. By then, however, the prop- erty market was starting to collapse and Covent Garden decided to post- pone its development plans. It decided, however, to seek per- mission for a small scheme because it wanted to press ahead with rehousing its tenants in Russell Street in order to get vacant posses- sion of the buildings, which are due to be demolished. The tenants, Max- wells, the restaurant, and the Brahms and Liszt wine bar, will be offered accommodation in the con- verted ground floor of the opera house's rehearsal studio building in James Street. It also wanted to make improve- ments to the opera rehearsal room and upgrade the dressing rooms. The community association is cyni- cal about these changes, which will involve, says Mr Monahan, \"incar- cerating staff in the subterranean vaults of Floral Hall\". The proceeds of the development are due to go towards the rebuilding of the opera house. But in such a project Â£5m is small beer and the community association is not alone in worrying whether the idea ofred- evelopment is truly viable up at a time when rents and values of com- mercial property have tumbled in central London. Mr Ensor is optimistic. He argues that the costs of development have fallen faster than property values, which had dropped by about 20 per cent. \"The scheme is marginally more viable than before,\" he says. The vagaries of the property mar- ket and the protracted planning process have delayed the projected starting date for redevelopment to 1996. Work is unlikely to be com- pleted before theend of the century and sceptics wonder whether it will ever materialise. Mr Ensor, how- ever, refuses to be downhearted. He compares the refurbishment of the opera house to the construction of the Channel tunnel. \"If they can do that for Â£2bn,\" he says, \"surely we can do this for Â£200m?\" NC ArV I - , Royal Opera House: tortuous search for development funds",

   "text_content" : "Anthony Robinson reports on the rebirth of the Soviet truck-maker as a capitalist-style enterprise T he dissolution of the Soviet empire is more than a ques- tion of ethnic minorities, borders and political power structures. It also raises difficult eco- nomic questions about the owner- ship of gigantic enterprises built to serve the entire Soviet state and financed directly from central funds. Kamaz, by far the largest truck plant in the world, is typical of such enterprises. It was built in the early 1970s on a greenfield site at Nabar- ezhnye Chelni, on the banks of the Kama river nearly 1,000 kms east of Moscow. Equipped with the then lat- est western foundry and automotive technology, it was designed to turn out 150,000 trucks and 200,000 diesel engines every year. Its function was to supply the entire Soviet market and generate hard currency to finance the foreign capital equipment incorporated in the plant used by exporting around 10 per cent of its production. The neo-Stalinist party bosses led by Leonid Brezhnev who made the political decision to build the plant ignored western advice that it would make better economic sense to start on a more modest scale and build up production gradually. They wanted a gigantic plant to impress the world. In practice, the plant has never pro- duced more than 120,000 trucks a year. This year, output, plagued by com- ponent shortages and the general disruption of the Soviet economy, is expected to decline to around 100,000 units. With traditional export mar- kets in eastern Europe also badly hit by the general collapse of Comecon trade, exports are expected to decline to around 6 or 7 per cent of this lower output. Despite its current problems, how- ever, Kamaz remains by far the larg- est truck complex in the world and a pillar of the Soviet economy. Its imminent re-birth as a capitalist- style enterprise - with control over its own investment and other resources and plans for joint ven- tures with western companies - make it potentially a key player in the transformation of the old planned economy. The process began last year when its financial and organisational structure was formally changed to create a western style corporation with a board of directors, an execu- tive management str'icture, and shareholders.' The old system under which decisions on investment, wages, the distribution of the end roduct to \"consumers\" and other key functions were determined by Moscow-based ministries was changed to give greater powers to management on the spot. The Soviet state took its \"profit\" by commandeering 18 per cent of the plant's production every year for which payment was made in the form of \"beznalichnye roubles\", essentially accounting roubles which could only be \"spent\" by drawing on similar blocked accounts with other Soviet enterprises for a limited range of goods. Other trucks were delivered to major suppliers through a form of barter organised by Gosplan, the old central planning agency and other ministries back in Moscow. The job of the plant managers was simply to produce. The first stage of the reform was the creation of 47m ordinary shares with a face value of 100 roubles each, equal to the Rbs 4.7bn original investment at 1971 prices. This includes the Rbs 1.5bn \"valuta rou- bles\" spent on imported capital equipment. She Soviet state currently holds 57 per cent of the shares and the self-proclaimed inde- pendent republic of Tatarstan, (for- mally an autonomous republic of the Russian federation) on whose terri- tory Kamaz was built, holds 13 per cent. The remaining 30 per cent are held by the 1,200 enterprises which either supply Kamaz or are major purchasers of its products. Now the 57 per cent owned by the Soviet state is up for grabs. Accord- ing to Leonid Komm, vice president and director of finance, the issue will be decided by a special inter- republican commission. Russia will retain the largest stake, but the out- come is complicated by the existence of five large subsidiary companies in. other republics, including the Ukraine. The formal ownership issue pales into relative insignificance, however, beside the exciting future prospects created by suppression of the com- munist party and the removal of ideological and other obstacles to the reorganisation of the Soviet econ- omy on capitalist lines. Last year, Boris Yeltaln, the preal- dent of Russia, visted Kamaz and' '*uqeytold dpoet olbhangel,; b Iht M nupV6rted &=' 0s 8,th we cmn live othrpeople in the world\". The determination to make Kamaz a \"normal\" enterpris iss strongly supported by Komm and other managers, keen to get on with the task of raising new capital, and bringing the enterprise up to modern standards. \"We're tired of being described in the western media as exotic, some- thing like pygmies in Africa. Kamaz is not exotic, it is a normal western style company which wants to live and survive,\" he says. That may be so for the future. But Nabarezhnye Chelni, which is home to the 160,000 Kamaz workers and their families, is a quintessential Soviet company town. The company, virtually the sole employer, owns 90 per cent of the flats in the serried rows of pre-fabricated blocks. The shops have the same depressing selection of fruit juice and pickles as elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Alexander Payalnikov, official trade union representative for 16,000 workers in the main engine shop, spends much of his time making Sol- omonic judgments about how to dis- tribute one refrigerator among 10 workers or trying to make sure that supplies of meat and other products for distribution in special shops within the factories are sufficient at least to satisfy the official ration card. Under the old system the manage- ment of Kamaz, like other Soviet enterprises, had no financial resources at its disposal. Further- more, once built, the plant, in typi- cal Soviet style, was starved of work- ing capital and deprived of the right to build up its own depreciation fund for the maintenance and replace- ment of capital equipment. As a result, after 15 years in oper- ation, much of the capital equipment is nearing the end of its useful life. \"Building such a plant today would cost between $10bn and $12bn. So it was a good investment. Over the years, however, we probably needed Rbs 5bn to renovate plant and equip- ment but received only Rbs2bn,\" says Komm, who moved to Kaniaz from the Togliatti car plant three years ago. For all his attachment to on e Hm* aM um laus m complex m N WOar= Kms -8- pmIE of me aOmv Oconomy\" capitalist-style managemiment, he has a portrait of Lenin hangi on his wall. \"I still admire him as an organ- iser,\" he explains. Komm's own organisational priori- ties, however, are very different. The first objective is to raise fresh capi- taL At present, Kamaz has virtually no bank debt but intends to borrow money from the fledgling commer- cial banking system. It also plans to issue bonds to domestic and foreign investors and raise its share capital by RbsSOOm to Rbs5bn through the issue of new shares. \"We plan to advertise the share offer on TV this month and sell them by auction,\" he says. Kamaz workers will be offered shares at a reduced price depending on their length of service. But as Jakob Myesin, an adviser to Nikolai Bekh, the Kamaz chair- man, makes clear, a key role in bringing Kamaz up to international standards will be through joint ven- tures with western companies. The present Kamas model, virtually unchanged since the first vehicle rolled off the line in February 1976, has performed valiantly on rough roads and under severe climatic con- ditions. It was also widely used by the Soviet army in Afghanistan. But it suffers from three main defects. Average engine life is only 200,000 kms - the result of a combi- nation of poor quality lubrication, poor maintenance and poor quality control during construction, this is far below western standards where engine life of 500,000 kms and above is common. Exhaust emissions are also far from meeting international standards while cabin comfort and visibility is also of a relatively low standard. The top priority is to bring the engine up to international standards and negotiations are under way with Cummins engines of the US. Senior executives from Cummins visited Kamaz at the start of this month and a Kamaz delegation is going to the US shortly to discuss a joint venture. This could include direct investment by Cummins and production of Cum- mins engines both for the domestic market and for export. Although the construction of Kamaz involved 700 contracts worth more than $1.5bn with foreign com- panies from 23 countries, the subse- quent deterioration in east-west relations, particularly after the inva- sion of Afghanistan, led to sanctions which severely restricted foreign contacts. The failure of last month's coup has swept away many of the linger- ing doubts over the ability of reform- ers to overcome the resistance to change from institutions like the communist party and the security apparatus whose powers have now been drastically curtailed. It is now possible for western com- panies and investors to take a new look at companies like Kamaz which has a highly trained workforce and virtually unlimited market through- out the former Eastern bloc. At cur- rent exchange rates the monthly sal- ary of a Kamaz worker of around 450 roubles for a six-day working week on a two-shift basis is a fraction of western levels. What is more, over the past 15 years Kamaz has built up a service organisation across the length and breadth of the country which could also serve as a distribu- tion and sales point for a wide range of spare parts and other products. In the midst of the turmoil through which the Soviet Union is passing, Kamaz reflects the old say- ing that \"Russia is never as strong as it looks, but also never as weak as it seems\". Those hidden strengths could well be about to re-emerge. But before they do the new rulers of Russia and the newly \"sovereign\" republics will have to make crucial macro-economic decisions to curb hyper-inflation and create a stable, convertible currency. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslo- vakia have already taken the tough decisions required. For Russia the cultural shock involved will be great. But the reward from a more rational use of its raw material, energy and industrial base could be even greater.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack STUDYING for an MBA is worthwhile after all, according to alumni from Ashrldge Man- agement College based in !erkhamsted, Hertfordshire. A survey, ambitiously enti- tled \"Exploding the MBA myth\", argues that graduates of its year-long course, launched in 1988, have emerged highly satisfiled with their qualification. The students felt the course had enabled them to hone equally their grasp of tradi- tonal usiness techniques and \"softer\" skills such as leader- ship and working in teams. One problem is that the sur- vey has only a small number of respondents - 50 in all, an 88 per cent response rate - from the three years that the course has been running. Of the 62 per cent of gradu- ates whose study sponsored by their companies, one quarter have since moved on to other jobs. Since finishing the degree, more than a third of company- sponsored students had a pay rise of less than 25 per cent, or no increase at alL That propor- tion rose to about 50 per cent for self-sponsored ones. Almost half of the company- sponsored MBAs saw comple- tion of the course as a chance to accelerate progress into general management within their present fields. Self-spon- sored students tended to look on the degree as a means of fundamentally changing their direction, transferring from specialist careers to general management. One of the unusual aspects of Ashridge College is the stress on practical activities. Company-sponsored students carry out research projects for their employer; self-sponsored ones find \"host\" companies for whom they act as consultants. Half the sponsored candi- dates said the recommenda- tions in their projects had proved useful to the company and they had helped imple- ment some of the recommen- dations. Only a quarter of self- sponsored students felt they had been able to help signifi- cantly implement their pro- jects. Most students found their projects more useful to them than to the company.

   "text_content" : "The Welsh National Opera season-opehdner is a new Ido- meneo. It marks (among other things) the return of Charles Mackerras to a work he has conducted, memorably, many times in London; the debut in the title role ofDennis O'Neill; and the first opera production of Howard Davies, the cele- brated theatre director. These contributions, and others, come together in a perfor- mance of sophisticated, deci- sive character. there was no messing about at the New Theatre on Wednesday, no shortage of conviction about either the chosen text or the chosen staging style. Mr Davies brings not just his immense theatrical experience to the task but a confidence about keeping music and drama in working partnership not always to be relied upon in a straight-theatre man. The show looks beautiful (designers William Dudley and Liz da Costa), moves forward with easy authority, and boasts its own distinctive stylistic signa- ture. In an work so comprehen- sive in its ability to survey and sum up past, present and even future areas of 18th-century serious opera, it is no bad thing that the decor and cos- tumes should combine ele- ments of ancient Classical, Baroque, early-Romantic, and Oriental art. Greek arches frame the set; the cut and colouring of cos- tumes is richly Delacroix-like; Baroque vistas and perspec- tives are carefully arranged; there are fascinating Levantine details in the props and ritual routines. Each character seems to have been placed for the purposes of maximum con- trast, elegant visual effect. Every arm or leg movement, every lighting change has a part in the \"choreography\" of the whole, and movement is constant - except when scenes come to rest in group tableaux, hardly a moment of stillness is evidenced. The sum total is at once highly impressive and, I felt, frightfully arty. It is as though the producer had decided the audience was in mortal danger of being bored by the great work, and had therefore devised a thousand superior ways of gussying it up and prodding it along. For me -the result, instead, was so often to shut off the dramatic oxygen supply, to drain away much of the emotional power and pas- sion - admiration for all the skills involved was regularly mingled with regret at the absence of that piercing direct- ness of impact which any Ida- memneo production should seek to attain. Strangely, Mackerras's con- ducting, for all its muscular propulsion and marvellous bal- ance of voices and instru- ments, colours and nuances, seems to second the staging style. So often I found myself registering the width of dynamic range, the cunningly tapered decelerating of phrases, the apt placing of vocal ornament: an overall flow, a unifying grand simplic- ity was lacking. The version of the opera favoured here is the later (Viennese) one, with a tenor Idamante; unlike in the preview of the production which the WNO gave at the Proms a week ago, there were plausible cuts to keep the run- ning time under control, though the familiar error of allotting Idamante his optional Act 2 rondo-aria - a long, lovely, entirely undramatic piece - was still uncorrected. Mr O'Neill, whose Italianate tenor is now muscled for opera of a much later, broader kind, lavishes heartfelt seriousness on the title role without per- suading me that he is fully suited to it. There is a lachry- mose, maundering note to the performance that renders one insufficiently grateful for its many good points; he huffs and puffs his way through the semiquavers of \"Fuor del mar\", bravely but uncomfortably. Suzanne Murphy's Electra is sometimes gusty, sometimes strikingly bold - Mr Davies, in a rare passage of dramatic mis- judgement, forces on her a Rebecca Evans and John Mark Ainsley skittishness of demeanour dur- ing the Act 2 love-reverie that sits unhappily on the singer's handsome face and frame. John Mark Ainsley's Idamante, a touch overparted in places, produces so much fine, gently affecting Mozart singing that one looks forward to his fur- ther growth in the part. The one feature of the per- formance for which I can sum- mon unqualified enthusiasm is the Ilia of the young Rebecca Evans. This is her first big assignment on the professional stage (she comes as a late replacement for the ailing Amanda Roocroft), and it is taken with astonishing accom- plishment - long-breathed phrasing, bright attack, a sweetness of personality that does not exclude regal dignity. More variety in colour is needed, and will doubtless be acquired; but whatever affect- ing qualities the performance as a whole possesses are largely her doing. Max Loppert",

   "text_content" : "The Other Place transforms itself into 19th-century Vienna for Trevor Nunn's precise, deliberate production of Measure for Measure. The play has been slowed to over three and a half hours of difficult closet drama, psychologically intense and emotionally exacting. It is an extremely fine account of the play. Nunn has succeeded here by avoiding grand theory about either the \"problem play\" status of Measure for Measure, or about the problems it presents. His pro- duction offers a set of intractable debates between Justice and Law, Will and Rea- son, Mercy and Principle; it knows that perplexity about its issues is neither igno- ble nor easily won. Moreover, the baffling clemency for Angelo at the end must be reached by something other than the creaky denouement; it must work person- ally and emotionally. The detail and meticulous timing which typify Nunn's Shakespeare are made to seem apt for every character - not just for the \"precise Angelo\" - allowing the issues here to emerge from the interaction of distinctly created individuals. This care- ful psychological approach is clear in the unexpected but wholly natural promi- nence of Escalus alongside Angelo, Isa- bella and the Duke, Vincentio. Allan Mitchell as Escalus is not only the still sane centre of a concupiscent Vienna, but has a certain saving grace of coarseness; he understands yet never colludes with the bawds and tapsters he has to deal with. His wonderful performance is full of tact, strength and subtlety. Alongside him, Philip Madoc plays Vin- centio as a prurient, muddy pragmatist who needlessly prolongs everyone's ago- nies and seems most at home when least thoughtful; Madoc, all worry and distrac- tion, makes the process of reestablishing a law tempered by justice into a bungled, contingent affair. If the play fails to per- suade us that it should be developed and ended as it is, Nunn's explanation lies in the Duke's demeanour. The evening turns on the moment when Isabella - thinking her brother dead - has to kneel for Angelo's life (Peter Brook regularly stopped the play for two minutes while she decided). Here, the pause is elec- tric. Claire Skinner's Isabella is an extrem- ist who learns how to think pragmatically when suing for her brother's life, and poet- ically when pleading for Angelo's. David Haig's Angelo is a volatile, proud man at odds with his sexuality. He is also unpredictable: he finds comedy in his hypothetical propositioning of Isabella, then an escalating viciousness at her refusal. A taut soliloquy-confession from a couch reminded one that this was, after all, Freud's city. The barred set recognises that so much of the action takes place in jail. Every- where, the acting carries the play's con- cerns into the smallest exchange. Roger Hyams as the louche Lucio, Sidney Living- stone as the upright Provost and Desmond McNamara as a befuddled Elbow are par- ticularly good in those prison scenes; and Peter-Hugo Daly acts Pompey as a chirpy opportunist fitted for any environment. This is a fresh psychological approach which marshals the play's energies not so much to prove how difficult its plot or its moral dilemmas can be, but by showing how difficult people can be. It calls up the world of the Sonnets: \"For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lillies that fester smell far worse than weeds.\" Andrew St George Aastair Muir Claire Skinner as Isabella I",

   "text_content" : "I atrica Morison admires samurai sculpture at the British Museum -V1 the Buddhist sculptnres I from Japan which this Sweek went on show at the British Museum oul eak, they would surely lai o. serious culture The Renais- sa eos Japanese Sculpture 1185-l33 has brought to Lon- don some 40 medieval statues, some over life-size, many dis- loged from temples where theyare are used to basking in incense and the chanting of hmantras. So zealously do the abbots guard their holy images that I have been told some can- not evenbe dusted. -Kamakura is part of the Japan Festival and it is free - remarkably, given how costly it must be to transport these fragile sculptures, made out of hollowed wood. Almost every one is designated as Important Cultural Property. The still higher grade of National Trea- sure was awarded to Kongara Doji, a sensuous youth with thick black curls carved by tiUnkei, the greatest master among the temple sculptors of the Kamakura era. The British Museum has very close links with Japan. No doubt the arrival of so many. deities, enlightened beings and temple dogs has something to do with the group of BM treasures which toured Japan last year, to rapturous acclaim. Kamakura is a city a couple of hours by train to the south of Tokyo. In 1185 the clan- leader Minamoto and his war- riors finally defeated their rivals in a sea-battle and estab- lished the first samurai govern- ment, moving the seat of power from Kyoto to Kamak- ura. The new samurai rulers were devout Buddhists, suscep- tible to the teachings of the Zen sect which was introduced at this time from China. In the civil war some of the most cele- brated monasteries had been put to the torch, and these were now lavishly rebuilt. Workshops of sculptors flour- ished, above all at Nara, and gave rise to a style which is often chunky, vigorous, and with a human quality which is instantly appealing. To many people, Buddhist sculpture conjures up a dreary prospect of a melde of blandly smiling deities, some with mul- tiple arms, seated on elephants and lotus-flowers. But Kamak- ura period sculpture can be quite different. Part of its appeal lies in the innate warmth that wood has as a medium. Although all these sculptures were originally painted or covered in gold leaf the ornate decoration has now faded to patterns of subtle beauty or fallen off altogether, leaving the grain of the wood and the mark of the chisel. It is the same story as contempo- rary Gothic sculpture: we are not getting it at anything like the full strength - and er- haps would like it a good deal less if we did. Two splendidly vigorous fig- ures sit at the entrance to the show, one unfurling a scroll, the other glaring at his writ- ing-tablet with his paint-brush poised. They come from the Hoshak=i Temple near Kyoto, where they normally guard Emma-0, king of Hell. Their scowls are monstrous, as well they might be, for their duty is to keep a tally of our sins for Judgment Day - a concept thoroughly at home in medi- eval Christianity. And yet, despite their distorted features, the pair are not devils as they would be in the western tradi- tion. They have the powerful bodies of samurai warriors, clothed and shod for action with their pantaloons tucked into soft riding boots. Like all these sculptures, Gusho Shin and Anketo Doji have eyes which are uncannily human. The eyes are made of crystals set into the head, with pieces of silk or paper held behind by bamboo pins to make the irises. The effect is disturbing, rather like the glass eyes of a teddy bear. You can even see blood-vessels in the eyes of the huge statues (over 10ft high) of the Kongo Rikishi, a ferocious pair of tem- ple guardians. In medieval Europe, writers were partial to stories about holy images which spoke or wept. A chill- ing 12th-century French story records that a statue of the Christ Child snatched a boy's lunch out of his hand in church, remarking that he would shortly be eating the bread of heaven. What would a western cleric have thought of the contemporary \"idols\" by masters like Unkei and Kakal, so life-like that in the gloom of a temple believers might well have thought the images lived? The most surprising feature of this exhibition is its beauti- ful portrait-sculptures. One of them may even have been made while its subject, the priest Chogen, was still alive. Chogen was an important fig- ure, who worked as a fund- raiser for rebuilding the vast Todaiji Temple at Nara. Here, it seems, we have the likeness of an important 12th-century religious figure, with his corru- gated brow, mouth' turning deeply down at the corners, and eyes rather askew. A lifes- ize sculpture of the missionary priest Shinko is completely black but if you look closely (the lighting is not all it might be) you can make out that old ascetic's right eye is almost closed and his chin is twisted, as if he had suffered a stroke. It is a compelling visual docu- ment - if only we had its like for a St Thomas Becket or St Thomas Aquinas! The exhibition catalogue is a good guide to who's who in the Buddhist pantheon but it does not answer many questions about contemporary aesthetics. Did anyone comment on this striking development of roll- gious portraiture, something so alien to western monastic tra- dition, in which mere bodily appearance was held to be triv- ia? In some cases, the por- traits are both highly realistic and yet imaginary, for exam- ple, in the delightful 14th-cen- tury statue of the infant Sho- toku, who as Prince Regent had established Buddhism in Japan in the 6th century. Quite as much of a child prodigy as Christ, he is shown by the sculptor at the age of two when he turned to the East and pronounced the formula \"I trust in Buddha\". If I have one favourite, it is the imaginary portrait of Mina- moto Yoritomo, the Shogun. This has to be one of the great images of worldly authority even though the warrior is seated on the ground, a pose unimaginable for a ruler in the west. A relatively small statue, the Shogun in his high hat seems to be positively blown up with pride, his pantalooned lower legs forming two billow- ing elipses in front of him. It is a stunning mixture of realism and formalism, a high point in an exhibition which is not sim- ply beautiful, but brings to life the great era of samurai Japan.

   "text_content" : "ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE It seems fitting that the music of Purcell should be revived at St John's, Smith Square, when the composer began his musical career just up the road in White- hall. There the Chapel Royal nurtured the 10-year-old composer in its choir and he later repaid the debt by writing for it some fine verse anthems. At St John's on Wednesday the Choir and Orchestra of the Age of Englighten- ment came together under the direction of Gustav Leonhardt to present a programme of late 17th-century sacred music for choir and string orchestra - a combination which blends with particular felicity in this hall. The performances of the four anthems were light and generally stylish. Leon- hardt is perhaps less ambitious in what he wants Purcell's music to say than William Christie, but he is wise enough to keep it dancing along and leave any profundity to speak for itself. The choir of 13 had women sopranos rather than boy trebles, like the Chapel Royal, and the words might have been used more vividly by the three solo- ists, Christopher Robson, Howard Crook and Michael George. Otherwise these were engaging performances. In between the anthems a lively Sonata for Strings by Carolus Hacquart (c1640- 1701) provided instrumental relief. The small band of OAE strings deserved a chance to show what they could do, as the rest of the evening involved no other instruments, except a single bassoon to lend extra weight to the final work, the Requiem in F Minor by Heinrich Biber. This is by no means the sombre piece in a single shade of grey that has been suggested. Although he never risks any charge of indiscretion, Biber enjoys him- self trying to find musical ways in which to depict the awesome sights of the Day of Judgement even more than Mosart and Verdi did. Leonhardt captured the music's pictorial delights and its expressive seri- ousness with equal skill. And the performance was enhanced by the arrival on the platform of two fine \"period\" sopranos, Julia Gooding and Donna Deam. Richard Fairnan",

   "article_dc_title" : "Competition in Gas",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "THIS WEEK'S decision by British Gas to restrict the amount of gas it will make available for power generation threatens to scupper the gov- ernment's plans for more com- petition in the electricity gen- eration market. It may also hasten the day when this pri- vatised near-monopoly is bro- ken up to make competition in gas supply a reality. British Gas's decision was aimed at ending a six-month row over the cost of gas sup- plied to the electricity genera- tion market. This blew up in March when British Gas raised its prices by 35 per cent to choke off demand from compa- nies wanting to build gas-fired power stations in the UK. The new prices would have made the projects uneconomic, and left the generators to scramble for supplies from the oil com- panies which control less than 10 per cent of the market. What added insult to injury was that British Gas appeared far from even-handed in the manner in which the rises were announced. Although many companies were in nego- tiations over gas supply, the new price schedule was pub- lished only a few days before it was due to come into force, after British Gas had just signed up with three favoured customers at the old rate. Mr James McKinnon, the gas regulator, demanded that Brit- ish Gas look again at the schedule and find ways of keeping prices closer to the old rates. And he insisted that British Gas should go on talking about supplies at the old, pre-increase price with two generators - Thames Power and a Mobil-Eastern Electricity joint venture - whose negotia- tions had been well advanced. New schedule The settlement announced on Monday by British Gas offers a new schedule with prices up by about half the original rise for all generators. However, the supply for power generation is to be limited to Ibn therms of gas a year - one-fifth of the total demand. Two days later, it was announced that Thames Power and Mobil-Eastern Electricity had contracted to buy almost all of this gas. They would also be paid compensation in an out-of-court settlement of their claims, which competitors say will underwrite their projects. This leaves at least 10 con- sortia with power project plans out in the cold, since the alter- native suppliers cannot hope to satisfy all the demand from the generators. Yet there is an obvious remedy in the hands of Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary. The apparent short- age of gas for power generation could swiftly be eased by importing gas from Norway or even further afield. The Department of Energy has been considering a request from National Power, one of the UK generators, to import gas from Norway for si:-: months. The government is thought to be reluctant to sanction gas imports for fear that North Sea reserves will inot be developed. Bizarre silence The Department of Energy's continued silence seems increasingly bizarre since gas imports would make a contri- bution to its declared aim of introducing more competition into the electricity generation market. For so long as gas imports are prevented, British Gas exerts an effective monop- oly on the supply of gas for power generation. This con- trasts with the government's willingness - rightly - to take away the monopoly power that the National Union of Mineworkers exerted on power generation by opening up the UK to coal imports. As for the role of British Gas, the affair demonstrates the need to introduce a greater degree of competition to gas supply in the UK. The idea that one dominant supplier should ration the supply of a freely available commodity effec- tively to customers who had the gumption to sue the com- pany demonstrates the arro- gance of market power. The Office of Fair Trading is belleved to have recommended a partial break-up of British Gas in a report now under con- sideration by Mr Peter Lilley, the industry secretary. With the European Commission moving to liberalise the import and export of gas across the EC, the government would be wise to anticipate the trend and put the UK industry in a stronger position to expand across the channel.",

If the governor of the Bank of England had avoided the word \"confident\" is his sober speech in Birmingham on Wednesday, and substituted something a little more conditional, such as \"we can all hope\", how differ- ent the response would have been. The Conservative elec- tion machine would not have seized on his speech as propa- ganda, the Labour leadership would not have reacted to the propaganda rather than the speech, and we would not be remembering the much more controversial words of a former governor, Lord Cromer, almost on the eve of poll in 1970. Does all this matter in the least to anyone apart from the politicians? Not much. The government may embarrass him again, but the governor will have learned to watch every comma in this hypersen- sitive season. His actual message, that it was time to turn his full atten- tion back to price stability, was unchanged and unexception- able. Any marginal fiddling with interest rates which may still be possible within the ERM constraint will in any case make little difference to the outlook. This is in fact mildly dis- couraging, as the markets seemed to understand: equities fell quite heavily yesterday morning, before recovering on some better corporate news. Indeed the chancellor, who has been talking recovery steadily since he took office 11 months ago, might learn another les- son from the markets: that nobody is much impressed with forecasts too often repeated.",

   "text_content" : "ePterI itere' in oie s ',in the Soviet Uion tarl~k of the enelrihtsg Sproblems facing the SSovietcon y cuts little ice with Mr Michael Smither, a to.execu- tive at HJ H f ~company. .'.the-:,S *:pd Yesterday he was in Moscow, finalasing a contracit to build a $15m baby-fod sac- tory in Georgiyevsk in the Rus- sian. republic, a project that will introduce Soviet infants to mass-produced, dried cereals flavoured with apple. Mr Smither, Heinz's director of east European operations, believes his factory will be among many joint ventures agreed by western groups over the next few years. But in the short term uncer- tainties abound, as the newly empowered Soviet republics seek to introduce western-style reforms into a rapidly deterior- ating economy. \"Things are evolving, but in a chaotic man- ner,\" says Mr Peter Danylow, a Soviet expert at the Federation of German Industry, an employers' group. As international companies shape up for what some argue is their biggest single expan- sion opportunity since the sec- ond world war, the following points will shape business developments: * Company attitudes. The lack of Soviet infrastructure and markets requires a long-term view on the part of western companies, coupled with a willingness to build up contacts at republican, local and individual factory levels, now that the old system of cen- tralised ministries and trading companies has disintegrated. Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering, metals and miner- als group which has built about 80 processing plants in the Soviet Union over the past 50 years, has 20 people in the country. They are studying what Mr Heinrich Binder, the corporate development direc- tor, says is an \"endless\" list of possible joint ventures - including schemes to convert Soviet military factories to make components for indus- trial machines. Mr Binder says the new cli- mate, in encouraging business links with local groups, is \"helpful in the long run, as we should be able to assess pro- jects more quickly and clearly\". For Imperial Chemical Indus- tries, Britain's biggest manu- facturer, which has traded with the Soviet Union for most of this century, the switch to local accords recently paid off in the notoriously inefficient farming sector - which accounts for about a fifth of Soviet gross domestic product. ICI, which has had a Moscow office, now 20-strong, since 1978, has set up a joint venture with 300 Ukrainian farms. After spending several years forging contacts with a farm- ers' group near Kiev - the 40 Years of October Collective Farm - ICI has taken a 50 per cent stake in a new company which will use western ideas in areas such as pesticides to improve crop yields. Another instance where the recent switch to local initia- tives appears to have had a positive effect concerns Tam- brands, the US tampon maker which two years ago set up a $10m factory in the Ukraine. Although production has gone smoothly, Tambrands' plan to earn hard currency profits through exporting raw cotton from the Soviet Union to its .1 2 uLi uu Jun UC JUn *uu Jul roiest 1987 1988 1989 1989 Souce:IMFWorld Bank, JOINT VENTURES IN THE SOVIET UNION France 11% ny 12% FWand 8% ! ^ 11 -Ã½ - -U !i -Ã½ I [ApdflM O CD. EBRD W u factories in western Europe was thwarted by bureaucratic tangles involving Moscow and the Ukrainian authorities. Tambrands has often been unable to gain the necessary customs clearances for the cot- ton, leaving its profits to accu- mulate as a largely worthless stock of roubles. But in recent months, the company has exerted more pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to use the political muscle they acquired after the abortive coup last month to issue the necessary documen tation. Mr Paul Konney, a Tambrands vice-president, says the Ukrainians \"have beern more confident to act by them selves\". * Commercial focus. Compa nies are likely to increase their chances of success by concen trating on ventures aimed at producing specific types of low cost goods in short supply, or on areas where the incorpora lion of western technology car add value to a reasonably promising Soviet industry. Increasing the efficiency of food manufacturing is one obvious opportunity. The Swedish group, Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval, is already active in this area through three joint-venture plants in the Soviet Union which pro- duce food-packaging materials. Huntsman Chemical, a pri- vately-owned US chemical and industrial products company, has 400 employees in the Soviet Union in fields including man- ufacture of disposable cups, petrochemicals and concrete blocks for housing. In each case, says Mr Peter Huntsman, a senior vice-president, the chosen areas had obvious internal markets, and opportu- nities existed for re-investing roubles profits into new Soviet production plants rather than out of the country. In some cases, the Soviet Union may have production expertise which can be upgraded by western know- how. One example concerns power engineering where, the Soviet Union has a large and respected steam-turbine pro- ducer in the shape of Lenin- grad Metal Works. Companies such as General Electric of the US and the Swedish-Swiss Asea Brown Boveri have been discussing the possibility of joint ventures with this group in which they could add com- plementary, and more modern, gas-turbine technology. * Internal politics. Opportu- nities for business ventures may well hinge on the compe- tence of the new, democrati- cally elected local authorities which are likely to replace the old, centralised structures. A case in point is the oil industry, which desperately needs modern western equip- ment and managerial methods to improve efficiency and cut enormous waste and pollution. The 8vlet'Unlon is the world's biggest oil producer, yet the Industryis stricken with obso- let ectWhpplogy, shorts of ndis collaborative deals under dis- cussion, Amoco and Chevron, two . twoig USoil groupar sa- Ã½ratelylnegtiatin large oifield 1 .orai on an production projects in Azerbaijan and Kaz- akhstas. In both cases, the negotiations have dragged on forfour years, as the republics and the central government authorities argued over vexa- tious issues such as the legal rights of the companies to own- ership of land and resources, and the terms on which they would be able to take profits out of the ventures by export- ing oil for dollars. Both companies are now guardedly optimistic that the apparent dissolution of much of the power of the central gov- ernment will leave the two republics more room to man- oeuvre in reaching deals. * Infrastructure. If the money for investment can be found (possibly via loans from inter. national monetary agencies) there is an enormous potential business in areas'such as roads, railways and telecom- munications networks. A big disincentive to business operations at the moment is that the Soviet Union has just one telephone line for every 10 people, compared with one for every two people in the devel- oped world. International com- munication is especially diffi- cult because the whole country has just 750 outgoing lines. Over the past two years, AT&T and US West of the US, and Australia's OTC, have announced plans to build inter- national exchanges in Armenia, Kazakhstan and Moscow. * Economic aid. One idea favoured by many western businessmen is to enhance existing credit - guarantee schemes organised by the main industrialised countries. This would mean that companies working in the Soviet Union would be sure of receiving pay- ment irrespective of the finances of their local partners. The broad idea of technical assistance projects, involving the transfer to the country of hundreds, if not thousands, of western advisers in the area of industrial restructuring and training is also backed by many. Mr Leonard Gueron, an Oxford-based economic consul- tant who advises Japan's Min- istry of International Trade and Industry on Soviet busi- ness opportunities, says the west should provide this kind of aid, if only to stave off the possibility of the Soviet econ- omy collapsing. Many companies believe, however, that the issue of eco- nomic aid is peripheral to the central question of the kind of commercial structures that are ultimately decided on by the region's newly emerging politi- cal authorities. It seems likely that this question may remain unanswered for many months. Mr Smither, the Heinz execu- tive, takes a cautiously posi- tive stance: \"The Soviet Union has gone a million miles in a short time. Although there will be instability and pain ahead, it is now on course to realise its true place in the world.\" Additional reporting by Andrew Baxter, Hugo Dixon and John Thornhill U U F-",

Built by the architect Sir Mervyn Macartney in 1890, the 31-room mansion was Estonia's legation between 1918 and 1940. Strictly speaking, it belonged to one of the country's banks, Eesti Maapank, which ceased business after Stalin's forces occupied Estonia in 194D. A few of the diplomats nevertheless stayed on in the legation, and for several years its bills were paid by the Estonian consulategeneral in New York. But eventually, to the annoyance of the Estonian :migrds in both Britain and America, the consulategeneral eventually decided to cut costs. It changed the ownership on the land registry from that of the BesaU Maapank to the names of two dplpomats in New York, and sold the building for 3sm In IMs. A UK court prevented the money hum being transferred to New York.

   "text_content" : "Peter Norman on the furore over Robin Leigh-Pemberton's speech A close colleague once marvelled how Mr Robin Leigh-Pemb- erton, the governor of the Bank of England, was blessed with an \"liner peace\" that seemedto sustain him through difficult times. The governor must be espe- cially thankful for this gift as he surveys the extraordinary political row that has erupted since he told an audience of businessmen on Wednesday that the British economy was \"undeniably improving\". Those remarks, and Mr Leigh-Pemberton's expression of confidence that \"we are now coming out of recession\", have prompted furious Labour charges that the governor is the creature of Conservative Central Office. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, yesterday Issued what many saw as a veiled threat against Mr Leigh-Pemb- erton when he said \"he may regret the fact if he gets pulled into the party political fray\". Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, was blunter. Mr Leigh- Pemberton, he said, \"must be replaced in the first week after Labour wins the election\". But is the governor really acting, as Mr Hain claims, \"as a paid-up member of the Con- servative pre-election cam- paign\"? If the actual content of his speech, the constitutional posi- tion of the Bank governor and historical precedents are any guide, the answer must be no. First, the speech. Labour has objected that Mr Leigh-Pemb- erton put an unfairly upbeat gloss on the Bank's view of the economy. It has cited the Bank's most recent quarterly Bulletin, published in August, in which Threadneedle Street judged that the economy was \"bumping along the bottom\" as evidence of his unwar- ranted optimism. But economies change and even the Bank's August Bulle- tin observed that the outlook was \"more encouraging\" than previously. To back his opti- mism, Mr Leigh-Pemberton invoked recent statistics on output, prices and wages that have emerged since publica- tion of the Bulletin. Many other commentators have done the same. But should the Bank gover- nor have commented in this way about the economy, par- ticularly at a time of pre-elec- tion fever? This question lies at the root of much of the Labour party's anguish. Because Britain does not have a written constitution, there is no handy guide of what a Bank governor can or cannot do. But practice and precedent suggest that Mr Leigh-Pemberton was entirely within his rights. Although final responsibil- ity for economic policy-making and monetary policy decisions lies with the Treasury, the Bank is expected to give advice on these matters, and not just to Whitehall. Since 1960, it has published its views in its quarterly Bulletin, which has been known to be controversial in the past. There is an even longer tra* dition of governors giving speeches. Many have been more trenchant than Mr Leigh- Pemberton's recent homily. In the dark days of 198 as slump stalked the land and unemployment soared, Mr Montagu Norman, the then Bank governor, used his Man- sion House speech to the City of London to sweep aside ai suggestions that the Bank should ease monetary policy. In words that seemed to cap- ture an imperious disregard for the plight of the poor, he declared: \"The dogs bark. The caravan moves on.\" In the 1960s, the then Labour government of Mr Har- old Wilson found itself on the receiving end of harsh and public advice from Lord Cromer, the Bank governor. With sterling having to be shored up by international credits arranged by the Bank, Lord Cromer warned in 1965 that the credits he had negoti- ated were \"no more guaran- tees of our future than Dun- kirk presaged swift victory in 1940\". By the time Mr Gordon Richardson took over at the Bank in 1973, it was expected that the governor should speak out on Important issues. Accordingly, there was great dismay when Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne (as he became) proved initially reluc- tant to speak in public. For a while the Bank was known unflatteringly as \"the Tomb of the unkpown Governor\". But it is argued that Mr Leigh-Pemberton should not have spoken out at such a politically sensitive time. Here the governor's critics also appear on shaky ground. There is, it is true, a conven- tion whereby the government and the Bank as its agent do not lower interest rates during an election campaign. But - all appearances to the con- trary - the campaign has not yet been joined. The inescapable conclusion is that the row about the gov- ernor's speech is nothing more than a storm in a tea cap. The sad part is that the furore over Mr Leigh-Pemb- erton's alleged support for the Conservative government has overshadowed the much more important second half of the speech in which he urged all future governments, irrespec- tive of political hue, to fight inflation at the earliest oppor- tunity. He was quite open in regret- ting the failure of the present government to achieve non-in- flationary growth in the mid- 1980s. Indeed, his speech con- tained sentiments very similar to those recently expressed by Mr Neil Kinnock: that Britain should at all costs avoid the cycle of boom and bust once it has recovered from the reces- sion.",

   "text_content" : "Friom Archbishop 2evor Huddlesion. Sir, You have reported that Deutsche Bank is to manage the first public bond issue for South Africa since 1985 [See International Company News for details]. Such a move is extremely short-sighted. The events of recent months, including the \"Inkathagate\" scandal, should have con- vinced the European banking community of the need for can- tion. Progress in South Africa will depend upon agreement being reached between the principal parties to the negotia- ting process of the sort which was achieved on Saturday with the adoption of the peace accord, which it is hoed will lead to all-party talks. It would be tragic if this fragile process were to be aborted because of the premature relaxation of international pressure. Financial sanctions - as the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers agreed in New Delhi a few days ago - have been \"the most demon- strably effective of all sanc- tions\". The committee will rec- ommend to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Harare next month that, subject to any contrary recom- mendation that ilgbht be made ===gemntat the manMDOd allpary onfrece in' Siuth Africa, financial sanctions, \"Inciling lending by iterna- tional financial Institutions like the IMF, be lifted only when agreement is reached on the text of a new democratic constitution\". I would hope that the bank- ing community would take a reponsible view and recognise that South Africa should naly regain access tont capital markets when there is agreement within South Africa that this will assist the peace TMe ANC has publicly urged banks not to subscribe to this bondM isae, while the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity have both stressed the importance of ma-ltainng flnancial sano- tdoes at least until there is agrseemnt on a interim gwr- ernmnent or some other form of agreed transitional arrange- ments. If this bond issue sets a pre- cedent which leads to substan- tial inflows of foreign capitaL it could seriously damage the prospects of agreement on a democratic constitution. This would be a recipe for political and economic instability.

   "text_content" : "Michael Prowse sees reasons for doubting the durability of the US economic recovery FEDERAL FUNDS F --- 4%- I 1986 I 87 I Source: Durastramun 88 I 89 I 90 I 91 I Sis b the Frn p osophr Pascal a d .0 If Go exists you him, you are in deep If he does not oxt you los little by being pious. f Substitute recession lor God and you have the explanation for last week's hlint cut in the 'US discoutat, the rate at which the Federal Reserve lends to banks. The Fed's offi- cial line is that the sluggish US economic recovery is still under way. But Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was keenly aware that if he failed to ease policy and the economy went down, he would face tremendous criticism, not least from the White House. If growth speeds up, on the other hand, the latest cut can always be reversed. The Fed's action raises a fun- damental question: how seri- ous is the risk that the fragile recovery will fizzle out? On paper, most economic forecasts remain reassuring. Conventional wisdom holds that the recession bottomed out in the second quarter. Most forecasters are predicting growth of 2-3 per cent over the next year. That is low by the standards of previous post-war recoveries when growth aver- aged more than 6 per cent. But it is acceptable given the need to correct the excesses of the 1980s, when private and gov- ernment borrowing got out of hand. Only a small minority of forecasters expects a double- dip recession, with output fall- ing later in the year. Yet sentiment has definitely changed. Much of the optimism voiced in May and June has evaporated: people's gut feeling is that growth may be depressed for longer than expected. Oxford Economics, a Penn- sylvania-based forecasting group, says the pervasive anxi- ety reflects a new and unfamil- iar pattern for the US business cycle. Forecasters have grown used to deep recessions and vigorous recoveries. A mild recession followed by a slug- gish upturn thus leaves econo- mists puzzled and uncertain. In theory, they know economic statistics will send contradic- tory signals for some time, but every bad number (such as last week's fall in retail sales) pro- vokes fresh doubts. There are, however, concrete grounds for doubting the recovery's durability: * The upturn has generated very few jobs since May. Non- farm employment has grown at a monthly rate of only 25,000 - a derisory figure in an econ- omy of 109m jobs. Employment is still falling in several sec- tors, including construction and state and local govern- ment. In a normal recovery, jobs would be created at the rate of about 125,000 a month. Job creation matters because it raises personal incomes and boosts purchasing power. * The recovery is narrowly based. Most of the positive indicators - such as rising industrial production, a rebound in orders for durable goods and the steady advance of the Purchasing Managers' Index - relate to the manufac- turing sector, which accounts for only a small portion of gross national product. Many service industries are still in recession. * Monetary indicators - which are taken seriously by both the Fed and many private economists - appear uni- formly discouraging. M2, the most closely watched measure of broad money, is scraping the bottom of its 2.54-6.5 per cent target range. The money stock has actually fallen since May. In simple terms, economists fear that a weakened banking system is not creating enough money to finance even a mod- erate recovery. Taking a pessimistic view, the end of the Gulf war and the drop in oil prices prompted a temporary surge in consumer and business confidence in the spring. This led to higher home sales, a recovery in the car industry and a rebound in industrial production, which has been cushioned by surpris ingly resilient exports. But consumption ran well ahead of subdued personal incomes and may now weaken. If demand falters, industrial confidence will decline, prompting further cuts in investment and employ ment. The Fed's latest \"beige book\" survey of regional economic conditions, released orn Wednesday, provides further grist for this mill. It found lit tle evidence of a sizeable rebound in consumer spending and pointed to troubling evi dence that the housing recov ery is losing momentum. Fig ures for production, mean while, hint at retrenchment. Output of cars fell sharply in August and seems set to fall further. Industrial production rose, but only by 0.3 per cent - the weakest figure since March. Optimists counter the gloom with two main arguments. The first is that the monetary data - which have done much to undermine confidence in sinan cial markets - are mislead ng. Mr Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the New York investment house, says analysts have been \"seduced by the simplicity of monetarism\". They look at the raw monetary data and con- clude that the economy must be in trouble. But M2 is heavily distorted, partly because banks are restraining the growth of their balance sheets in order to improve their capital ratios. This has depressed deposit rates relative to returns on bonds, making money a less attractive asset. Allowing for this and other distortions, Mr Giordano calculates that M2 is growing at an inflation-ad- justed rate of about 3 per cent, sufficient to permit a healthy recovery. He sees no reason why U1S economic growth should not approach 4 per cent over the coming year. Some economists are also cheered by movements in cor- porate inventories - stocks of goods awaiting sale. When demand falls in a recession, companies react by cutting inventories sharply. Double dip recessions typically occur when companies start rebuild- ing inventories prematurely. With sales still weak they are for9edto cut production agalp, caofsin the'ec, onomy to) 'lak' 9*- time., But the latest data seem not to indicate this pattern. Bisl- ness inventories were still declining in July, having fallen sharply for the previous three quarters. This means that the recent rise in Industrial pro- dicton did not keep pace with sals. Predictions of modest economic growth are based in part on the assumption that Inventory liquidation must eventually stop. When this occurs, the economy will receive an automatic lift Even the optimists, however, welcomed the Fed's latest interest rate cut. Indeed the near unanimous support for action to bolster the recovery is striking. Last Friday, Mr Greenspan faced no dissension within the -Fed. Mr Wayne Angell, a Fed governor appointed in the Reagan era who favours strong action to curb inflation, opposed a rate cut in the spring. Last week he was mute. Hawkish regional Fed presidents were among those calling for cheaper money. But will the latest easing of policy make much difference? It should have some impact on sectors particularly sensitive to interest rates - such as con- struction. But with debt bur- dens high, many companies and individuals seem uninter- ested in loans, whatever their cost. With inflation running at 3-3.5 per cent, the interest rate climate is, anyway, less attrac- tive than it looks. One of the striking aspects of current monetary conditions is the wide spread between rates administered by the Fed and the cost of funds to consumers and businesses. At 5 per cent, the discount rate is at its low- est level since 1973. But banks' prime lending rate is 8 per cent and many borrowers pay sub- stantially more. The differen- tial - unimaginable in the 1970s - reflects the banking system's need to improve prof- itability. Long bond yields, meanwhile, have only recently dipped below 8 per cent. If the economy does not show more convincing signs of recovery, the Fed is likely to march interest rates still lower. With a prospective fed- eral budget deficit of $340bn, cheaper money is the only pol- icy weapon available in Wash- ington. Lower interest rates should gradually boost confi- dence and economic activity. The risk of an economic relapse has undoubtedly risen, but the best bet still remains exceedingly sluggish growth: a mild recovery that feels much the same as a mild recession.",

   "text_content" : "Tom Mr David Martin. Sir, Frank Vibert (Personal View, September 18) asked the right questions concerning the future European Community of 20-plus members, but gave the wrong answers - unless his real objective is to destroy the Community. Unanimous decision-taking among such a large number of states would turn the Commu- nity into a diplomatic confer- ence similar to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Although unanimity might be appropri- ate when deciding on whether to give new responsibilities to the Community, it cannot be justified for running existing policies. Giving such a block- ing power to individual mem- ber states would make each and every common policy pris- oner of vested interests. Even now it is difficult enough to reform the Common Agricul- tural Policy, to agree on a posi- tion in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or settle a host of other matters because of the ease with which minori- ties - sometimes of one - can prevent a decision that affects sectoral interests of their own, no matter how costly the fail- ure to take a decision may be for the Community as a whole. As to the suggestion that member states should be able to opt out of decisions, does Frank Vibert really believe that individual member states should be able to apply lower environmental standards than others, or attract money-laun- dering by opting out of Com- munity banking standards or apply a different external tar- iff? This is a recipe for what Americans call \"free-loading\". If a Community of 20-plus is to be able to manage its com- mon policies, more, not less, majority voting will be neces- sary, and the Commission will need to assume a more effec- tive executive role. This in turn will require stronger pow- ers to ensure democratic accountability to be given both to the European Parliament and, as regards their individual ministers, national parlia- ments. These issues are being addressed by the current Inter- governmental Conference on olitical Union. The question is whether it will do so ade- quately.

   "text_content" : "The Dutch government is making a fine old mes of Its chair- manship of the European ;Community. Twis is excel* lent news for the prime minis- ter, Mr John Major. He has reason to hope that whatever happens at Maastricht in December will leave him looking good and the Conser- vativg arty politically unsathed1art To be sure, the 12 members of the EC are expected to sign agreements on European political and monetary union at Maastricht. I say \"are expected to\" rather than \"will\" because the partici- pants may fail to agree, although it is more likely that they will do a deal based on the most that the least willing will accept. We should not lay all the blame on the Dutch. The EC is a permanently changing set of treaty relationships between consenting sovereign states, supervised by a Com- mission whose mastery of detail gives it inordinate influ- ence. We may relinquish our independence of action, as with the exchange rate mech- anism, but no sovereignty is lost while the option of with- drawal remains. This loose arrangement is likely to include many more member states before it becomes more cohesive. That is the reality. The aspirations of Maastricht, which are to move towards an ever-tighter federation of the 12, run into that reality as into a brick wall. It just happens that the revolving half-year of glory as temporary officer presiding over the process has fallen on the shoulders of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister. No wonder he shrugged them so eloquently after meeting Mr Major on Wednesday night. He would not attempt, he said, to gain \"a full 100 per cent political union at Maastricht\". Actually, he has been attempting like mad, ever since he took over from the Luxembourg prime minister, Mr Jacques Santer, in July. There on the table was a draft agreement, written by Luxem- bourg. The British and French governments saw it as a work- able starting point. It kept defence foreign affairs and 9Gr2 security out of the EC mechanisms, out of the Rome Treaty and away from the clutches of the true seder- alists. To British thinking, even that draft was imperfect. It extended the competence of the European Commission in every clause. But the struc- ture of \"separate pillars\" of co-operation was regarded as promising. Mr Lubbers' government has tried to replace the pillars with a monolith. It has let loose an unofficial, semi-com- pleted, not-quite-agreed, pen- cilled-in, nudge-nudge set of proposals. These bring foreign policy and security under EC control. This is consonant with Dutch yearnings for a true federation; it also follows the German approach partic- ularly on extending the pow- ers of the European parliament. Britain has spent the past week trying to persuade the Netherlands that this is not acceptable. The negotiations on political, economic and monetary union of Europe are good news for the Tories Perhaps Mr Major underlined the point when he met Mr Lubbers on Wednesday. He is in a stronger position to do so than his predecessor was. In her latter years Mrs Margaret Thatcher was written off as a ranter on Europe. If Mr Major were to withhold consent to an amendment of the Rome Treaty on German-Dutch lines he would do so as a willing participant in EC affairs, who could not in conscience accept the form of political union on offer. If the election is held in November he will be free from political harm at Maastricht in December. If it is put off until next year, a reasoned defence of British interests could do him good. The inter-governmental negotiations on economic and monetary union are even bet- ter news for the Tories. Dutch - le: German - conditions for the introduction of a sin- gle European currency are so stringent that no British gov- ernment will have to worry about giving up the pound for thb Ecu until the end of the century or beyond. First, there must be economic con- vergence. Second, there must be an initial quorum of mem- bers (six, say the Germans; 10, say the Spanish) which, hav- ing achieved convergence of inflation, budget deficits and the national debt, are willing to accept a single currency, leaving the others to catch up. Third, the new currency must be managed by an indepen- dent central bank that is so independent that it out-Bund- esbanks the Bundesbank. (Its directors, once appointed, would sit for eight-year terms, unsackable the while.) If this Dutch draft sticks, Mr Major will be able to sign a document on Emu that allows Britain to join if it wants to, but does not commit it to do so, ever. His ever- watchful predecessor will still object to the government's signature on a single-currency amendment to the Rome Treaty, arguing that the Brit- ish will have to pay into Euro- pean funds to facilitate the economic growth of the poorer members. That argu- ment will be countered by the observation that since Mrs Thatcher left office the num- ber of countries which pay into Community funds has grown. By next year there will be five. With Germany financing its acquisition of its eastern provinces and Spain bewildered at finding itself a net contributor, proposals for budgetary expansion to help the Portuguese and the Greeks may not be accepted. Currently chairing the EC's two inter-governmental con- ferences, our friends in The Hague have been taking a more or less German line on nearly everything. This can hardly please the French. The Italians are distressed about the proposals for economic union, since their budgetary deficit rules them out of mem- bership for many years to come. The Danes surely sus- pect the proposals for political union. The Portuguese are said to be worried about both. All of this may well be put right at a special pre-Maa- stricht \"conclave\" of foreign ministers plus officials called for November 13 and 14; if it is not Mr Lubbers might qual- ify for the post of honorary president of the Bruges Group.",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow THE pioneering eye surgeon who has become one of the Soviet Union's dollar million- aires has been invited to be the next Russian prime minister. Mr Svyatoslav Fedorov, 64, confirmed yesterday that he had been invited by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to form a new government, subject to the agreement of Mr Mfikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president. However, Mr Fedorov, an early advertisement for peres- troika because of his skill, his production-line surgery meth- ods and his high earning abil- ity, has given Mr Yeltsin a list of conditions - including hav- ing one day a week to perform Moscow asks iet for $15bn food aid ..........................Page 2 Joint ventures in the Soviet Union..............................Page 16 Observer ........................Page 16 operations at his eye hospital on the outskirts of Moscow. Speaking at his clinic, Mr Fedorov, a long-time advocate of rapid reform and privatisa- tion, said the programme he had put to Mr Yeltsin was very simple. \"I must be able to make Russia into a normal capitalist country,\" he said. \"We will have to have free prices, we will have to sell land - that is the most important thing - and we must make a financial system which works. \"At present, we have democ- racy in politics and Stalinism in economics. I said that I will want to appoint a new cabinet, and that I will cut out both ministries which are in charge of producing and keep only those which are required for health and social security, and for foreign and internal affairs. \"The bureaucracy must be shrunk to 10 per cent of what it is now,\" he said. Mr Fedorov, whose wealth has come not only from his eye clinic but also the luxury hotel which he has opened next to it, said businessmen must be free to make deals in the same way 1 he had done, bringing in for- t eign capital. A recent deal with a Califor- c i nian company to make contact i 1 lenses, he said, had given the I , US company 60 per cent and r i him 40 per cent - a pattern he a a said should be followed by 1 f other Russian business people. I r \"This was done by me and I I the company from California: if i . the Finance Ministry had been 3 involved, they would have t taken 20 per cent just for pass- i ing the messages,\" he said. I Mr Fedorov was elected as a c i deputy to the Soviet Congress c 1 of Peoples Deputies on the i , Communist party list. I 2 He is also a member of I Sthe Supreme Soviet's Commit- ! ir- tee on Economic Reform. However, he has not yet ir- clinched the job of prime minm- ct ister. Mr Yeltsin has in the ie past offered positions to a ad number of contenders at the ie same time and there may still iy be other candidates for the pre- e. miership, including Mr Oleg id Lobov, the first deputy prime if minister. Mn The offer follows Mr Ivan re Silayev's resignation from the a- premiership. Mr Silayev said on Wednes- a day that he had decided tocon- is centrate on his post as chair- ie man of the Committee for the Management of the National of Economy, which acts as the It- Soviet government.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Car Output Falls 30% in August",
   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent UK car production fell by 30 per cent in August to 57,195 from 81,711 in the same month a year ago, as the rate of export growth slowed signifi- cantly and the rate of decline in output for the domestic mar- ket accelerated. Mr Simon Foster, director of the Society of Motor Manufac- turers and Traders, the UK motor industry trade associa- tion, said yesterday that \"long-term damage to the industry may.be unavoidable if these trends continue\". In spite of the deep recession in the domestic new car mar- ket, UK car putput had previ- ously been sustained this year by a big jump in exports. Mr Foster said, however, that the rate of export growth was expected to slow signifi- cantly in the final months of the year because of weaker for- eign markets. In the first eight months of the year car output - at 853,574 - was 3.4 per cent higher than for the correspond- ing period a year earlier, but 3.7 per cent lower than the level of two years ago, accord- ing to figures released by the Central Statistical Office and the SMMT. Car output for export mar- kets in the first eight months, at 403,890, was 97 per cent higher than in the correspond- ing period a year ago, while production for the domestic market, at 449,684, was 27.6 per cent lower. In August, however, output for export markets at 30,599 was only 14.5 per cent higher than a year ago, while produc- tion for ,the home market showed a 51.6 per cent drop. The SMMT gave a warning at the end of July that the Brit- ish motor trade and industry were facing a further 40,000 job losses by next summer, which would bring the total lost since mid-1990 to 68,500. At the same UK car production Thousands (monthly) 150 ota- 100- 50-ru XL 0 1989 1990 1991 Source:C0SO and Soiety of Mlotor Manufadurers and Trader time, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said that 800 fran- chised motor dealers will have been forced out of business by mid-1992 as a result of the decline in the car market. Leading car producers have forecast a fall in UK new car sales to around 1.55m this year from 2m in 1990 and a record 2.3m in 1989. Commercial vehicle makers have been hardest hit by the recession. Without the cushion of substantially higher export sales, commercial vehicle out- put has dropped by 28.3 per cent in the first eight months of the year, but the decline accelerated in August with a year-on-year drop of 48.4 per cent. Export production fell by just over a third from last year's August level. Alison Smith writes: Mr Doug Henderson, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said that given the number of Jobs at risk, large car production plants were also under threat. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: \"With worrying figures like these it is not surprising that ... the Conservatives are now jittery and unconfident about facing the electorate.\" European car figures, Page 3",

   "text_content" : "By Alani Pike, Social Affairs Correspondent HOME OWNERSHIP rose sharply throughout the Thatcher era to twothirds of all households by last year, according to .a nationwide sur- vey. i Between 1971 and \"9. the number of households owning their homes either outright or on a mortgage increasd from 4 per cent to percent - the biggest rise occurring from 1981, pieliminary results of the General Household survey show. The increase was due partly to the sale of council homes to their tenants. However, the proportion of p le with mortgages dropped y from 42 to 41 per cent between 1989 and 1990, the first fal since 1971. Another trend confirmed by the survey is a continuing change in the size of house- holds. The proportion containing only one person rose from 17 to 26 per cent between 1971 and 1980, while the proportion with five or more people halved from 14 per cent to 7 per cent Average household size has declined steadily since 1971 from 2.91 to 2.46. Only a quar- ter of households now reflect the conventional image of a couple with dependent chil- dren. I Throughout the 1970s and 10sB the proportion of single parent households increased - rom 8 per cent in 1971 to 13 per cent in 19i1 and 19 per cent a 1990.

As part of the capital control I measures, Madrid is drawing t up rules to allow foreign com- panies not quoted in their home stock markets to be listed on Spanish markets.

   "text_content" : "It is perhaps just as well that the first tentative signs of con- sumer-led recovery are appear- ing in the UK. Yesterday's grim warning from RMC not to bet on any improvement in profits this side of 1992 vividly confirms that the engine of economic growth will not be capital spending. These days, companies need to buy concrete like they need another hole in the balance sheet. Those that have not per- suaded the City to repair the financial damage through rights issues have been forced to de-stock and cut back their capital investment, a process which cannot go into reverse until existing capacity is used up. Judging by the noises from RMC and the further slide in share prices across the build- ing materials sector yesterday, investors have still not grasped just how long this may take. The question for RMC, given that profits next year may still be Â£80m-Â£90m below their 1989 peak and the UK contribution less than a third of what it was two years ago, is whether the shares deserve to trade on a prospective multiple of some 18 times. Germany, France and Spain have done well, but it must be open to doubt how far these strong performances on the continent can be sustained. Money and time are being devoted to building up a strong position in East Germany - heavy provisions made when the Berlin toe-hold was estab- lished mean the costs do not show up in the profit and loss account - but that is for the longer term. The combination of RMC's strong market posi- tion and sound management certainly give it a core position in most portfolios: but it is hard to see the faithful being rewarded in the short term. Hawker Siddeley The conventional explana- tion behind the 6 per cent surge in Hawker Siddeley's shares yesterday is that disap- pointing results make it even more vulnerable to a predator. The bids for Beazer and Racal earlier this week may have pushed Hawker further into the limelight because it is one of the few large UK targets left for the likes of BTR, or even GEC. But scarcity need not be the same thing as value. Hawker's statement should have diminished its appeal. Last year's savage cost-cut- ting effort has failed to prevent a steep drop in return on sales - at 5.8 per cent, a far cry from the 9.1 per cent achieved in 1989. That underlines how Hawker has been a victim of FT-.e Index: 2,5~.7 (+5.1) Guinness Share price relative to the FT-A AM-Share Index 250 MlMAl M^^Â®arl$8aam NM 1987 88 89 90 91 Source: OtamMEs pressure on prices as well as on volume. The latter may recover as the recession ends. There is less chance of much recovery in prices, particularly given changing procurement patterns in the privatised UK power sector. So the scope for a new owner to wring extra profit out of margin improve- ment is small. Worse still, the recession has delayed badly- needed efforts to restructure through disposals. It would be rash to assume that a predator could do any better than the present management. There is little evidence of stake-building in yesterday's price rise, which occurred on turnover of just 3.6m shares. There might always be a bid- der lurking somewhere pre- pared to value the company on the basis of assets rather than earnings. That would take some courage, given the mea- gre prospective return. At 640p the shares are on a historic multiple approaching 16. Viewed purely on fundamen- tals, this is high for a company whose recovery will at best lag the end of the recession. Guinness Guinness's earnings growth in recent years has been so extraordinary that the market is bound to keep asking itself when it will run out of steam. Yesterday's interim figures - earnings and dividend up 13 per cent, the Gulf war and recession notwithstanding - suggest this may be the wrong question. The defensive quali- ties of shares like Guinness and Glaxo are by now taken for granted. The question is rather when the market becomes convinced enough of imminent economic upturn to leave such stocks behind. That time is not yet, at least if yesterday's figures from RMC are a guide. In the mean- time, the striking aspect of yes- terday's figures is that despite pressure on sales volume, Guinness has yet again raised its margins, chiefly because of a continued switch to higher- priced Scotch. Logic suggests that this must be a finite pro- cess. But in the meantime Guinness continues to pump out cash - Â£161m after tax and dividends in the half year - which has gone part way to financing an extraordinarily varied acquisition programme in worldwide alcoholic drinks, which so far this year has taken in Spain, Germany, the US, Australia and Venezuela. At yesterday's 1005p, the shares are on perhaps 15 times this year's earnings. It remains difficult to see them as expen- sive. Shanks & McEwan Compared with the punish- ment meted out to Shanks & McEwan on its profits warning yesterday, British Aerospace got off lightly last week. On the basis that Shanks's earn- ings will probably be flat this year, the waste management group's shares were marked down by 17 per cent. At least they are now easier to buy. Until recently, no-one in their right mind would sell the sec- tor's star performer; since 1988, it has delivered average growth of 20 per cent in divi- dends and 21 per cent in earn- ings. The question is whether the warning suggests a longer- term problem for-Shanks, and by implication for water com- panies like Severn Trent which have already diversified into the business. Shanks's explana- tion is that the recession has simply taken far longer to reach the waste management industry than other sectors. Customers, it seems, do even- tually pile up their waste to avoid spending; but they will have to dispose of it in the end. Shanks is in temporary diffl- culty because its higher mar- gin processes, particularly Rechem's incineration busi- ness, have been hit by falling demand. Its reliance on site contract work in the south-east of England has not helped, but recovery should be prompt when the economic upturn comes. That seems enough to pre- vent further damage to the share price for now. Shanks remains easily the largest and best of its kind. Yet one is left with a nagging feeling that earnings in the waste business are not sufficiently reliable to Justify the sector's premium rating.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Guinness Ahead Despite Recession",
   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd GUINNESS, the international drinks and brewing group, yes- terday reported a 9 per cent increase in taxable profits while LVMH, the French drinks and luxury goods group, announced a slight fall in profits. The purchase of extra Guin- ness shares last year was partly responsible for holding LVMH's consolidated net profits down to FFr1.21lbn (Â£121m) for the first six months, a fraction below the FFrl.24bn in the same period of 1990. Guinness's taxable profits increased to Â£350m from Â£322m in what the group called one of its hardest half years. Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman, said: \"The recession in the English speaking world has proved longer-lasting and deeper than anticipated.\" During June LVMH acquired additional Guinness shares to maintain its holding at 24 per cent following dilution resulting from conversions of Guinness's convertible preference shares and loan stock. Guinness maintains a 24 per cent holding in LVMH. Mr Tennant said both LVMH and Guinness reaffirmed that nei- ther had any intention of increas- ig the present level of cross- shareholding. However, the speed at which LVMH bought its Guinness shares surprised Guinness, although it was partly reassured when LVMH said it had only bought the extra shares to main- tain its shareholding at 24 per cent. Guinness would find it difficult to increase its shareholding in LVMH without first consulting Mr Bernard Arnault, its chair- man. This is because Guinness's interest in LVMH is held jointly with the Financiere Agache 1- group through Jacques Rober, a holding company registered in i France. I Mr Tony Greener, managing , director of United Distillers, said: I \"The relationship between LVMH F and us is very important to both Scompanies. There is no merit in r merging both businesses. It does not make commercial reality.\" t Guinness has continued to i increase the price of whisky in I line with its policy of \"confident pricing\" which has contributed to s increased profits, f Mr Greener denied that by D increasing whisky prices Guin- ness was guilty of pursuing a short-term policy of increasing profits. \"Scotch whisky was ridicu- lously underpriced. We have increased prices in line with inflation,\" said Mr Greener. Over the past year the group spent more than Â£700m on acqui- sitions including Venezuela's largest spirits company, Indus- tries Pampero, Cruzcampo in Spain and the establishment of an import and marketing com- pany in South Africa.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE SHARE price of RMC, the world's biggest ready-mix con- crete producer, fell 23p to 635p yesterday after the British group warned that profits were unlikely to recover greatly next year. Mr Jim Owen, managing direc- tor who yesterday announced a 36 per cent fall in first-half pre- tax profits to Â£69.9m, said that analysts who had been forecast- ing a Â£15m to Â£20m improvement in profits to Â£190m for the whole of 1992 were too optimistic. He said: \"We will be doing well to achieve round about the same level of profits as we expect to earn this year.\" The group is expected to make pre-tax profits of between Â£165m and Â£170m for the 12 months to the end of December, compared with Â£216.2m in 1990 and Â£248m in 19B9. Share prices of other large Brit- ish building materials groups fell sharply following the warning that the recession in the UK con- struction industry was likely to continue. Steetley, which produces bricks, tiles and aggregates, fell 14p to 335p. Redland, the world's biggest concrete tile producer, fell 8p to 566p Mr Owen said he expected con- crete sales in the UK to fall by about 20 per cent this year and by a further 5 per cent next year. He saw no end to the downturn in commercial property markets. UK operating profits during the six months to the end of June fell 62 per cent to Â£19.2m. Volume sales of sand and gravel fell by 14 per cent and hard rock sales by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent as building industry demand con- tinued to sink. Prices in some areas fell up to 10 per cent, squeezing margins. However, RMC reported contin. ued growth in Germany where profits increased by 6 per cent to Â£32.1m during the first half. The group's recently acquired cement works and concrete plants in eastern Germany made a profit for the first time in July. Profits were also higher in France, Spain and Israel Israel benefited from the increase in building to house a growing tide of immigrants, particularly from the Soviet Union. Profits fell in Belgium, Holland, the Irish Republic and the US. Mr Owen said the group was looking for aggregate reserves in eastern Germany where it planned to increase its concrete plants from 36 to 75 by 1995. The interim dividend rose to 6p from 6.4p a share.

   "article_dc_title" : "Air France Nears Sabena Deal",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "Paul Betts in London and David Buchan in Brussels report that British Airways is about to lose out in an alliance with Sabena of Belgium Pre-tax profit/Id 1990 (E million: British Airways 130.0 * Air France (71.9) Sabena (120.3) * 1990/91 \" Schedule flights, international I Sources: Association of Europe L& FT_.g Vk' fmmb.aPT. gt Number of passengers carried- 1990 (million) British Airways 25.17 Air France 15.69 Sabena 3.17 . ir France is close to com- pleting a strategic alliance with Sabena, thwarting a year-long attempt by British Air- ways to invest in a large minor- ity stake in Belgium's loss-mak- ing national carrier. Mr Pierre Godfroid, Sabena's chairman, confirmed yesterday that he was \"on the point of final- ising\" a deal with Air France, whereby the French state carrier would inject BFr4bn (Â£66.56m) into the capital of the troubled Belgian airline. The Sabena chairman said in a Belgian newspaper interview that the Air France bid met all condi- tions set by the Belgian govern- ment last March, when it gave the state-controlled airline a capi- tal injection of BFriObn to pay for redundancies and promised a further BFr9bn if and when Sabena found an industrial part- ner willing to inject BFr6bn in it. Until late this summer, BA was still widely regarded as the front-runner to forge a strategic alliance with the loss-making Belgian national carrier. As late as July, Mr Godfroid was openly stating that BA was his airline's favourite candidate for a partner- ship. Suggestions that Air France, the French national airline, was also negotiating a rival deal in the wings were largely regarded as an effort on the part of Sabena to put pressure on BA to acceler- ate the completion of a share- hold~ig agreement; But although BA said yester- day it was still talking to Sabena, it is clear that the UK carrier has now virtually dropped out of the race with Air France - expected to complete a deal soon with the Belgian airline. Air France would only offi- cially confirm yesterday it was discussing a commercial agree- ment with Sabena. But the French airline is understood to be considering making a large financial investment in the Bel- gian airline. This is expected to see Air France together with other French financial partners invest about BFr4bn in Sabena. A fur- ther BFr2bn would be provided by Belgian venture capital inves- tors including the Groupe Brux- elles Lambert, the large Belgian holding company. Negotiations with BA started last January after the collapse of an earlier joint venture between BA, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines .and. Sae1na. The joint venture had faced objections from the European Commission on compe- tition grounds and BA had become unhappy with the struc- ture of the deal which gave it only a 20 per cent stake in a Sabena subsidiary. BA subsequently expressed interest in investing in a large minority stake in the Sabena par- ent company. The UK carrier was considering investing BFr6bn for a minority stake of well over 25 per cent in Sabena. Through its proposed partnership with Sabena, BA intended to develop a new European airline hub in Brussels. Although BA was not looking for control of the Belgian carrier, it made clear it wanted a degree of influence in the airline's affairs commensurate with its financial investment. It also insisted in becoming Sabena's sole airline partner. With signs that the Belgian side was reluc- tant to agree to these terms, BA had becothe 'increasingly luke- warm towards the deal, espe- cially at a time when airline prof- its remain under pressure because of the recession and heightened competition. Air France appeared to have provided the Belgians with a more acceptable political solution for the recovery and recapitalisa- tion of their national flag carrier. The French airline also seemed to have become increasingly attracted by the commercial pros- pects of a partnership with Sabena, giving it - through Brussels and its Paris base of Charles de Gaulle airport - two significant international hubs in the centre of Europe. The part- nership is also likely to strengthen Air France's position on African routes. Under its chairman, Mr Bern- ard Attali, Air France has sought to consolidate its position on its home market at the same time as seeking partnerships in Europe. The French airline recently absorbed UTA, the independent French long-haul carrier with an extensive African network, as well as Air Inter, the domestic French carrier. It has also reached a broad collaboration pact with Lufthansa, the German national carrier. he Air France deal with Sabena has provoked pro- tests from the Volksunie, the Flemish nationalist party in Belgium's ruling coalition. Mr Godfroid, who was brought up in Slanders but has worked for French and US companies, dis- missed complaints by the Flem- ish nationalists that the govern- ment was selling out the national carrier to French interests. Mr Godfroid said he under- stood the Volksunie's reaction because it mirrored an earlier outcry from French-speaking pol- iticians in Belgium when it seemed that the Dutch carrier KLM might take a stake in Sabena But the economic inter- ests of the airline and its 10,000- strong vorkforce should be para- mount, he said, not Belgium's communal politics. Any Air France link-up with Sabena will also be closely scru- tinised by the European Commis- sion's anti-trust directorate, EC officials said, noting that the two carriers were in significant com- petition on certain African routes. A further complication may arise out of the commis- sion's investigation of the French government's plans to increase Air France's capital, both directly and through the state-controlled Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) taking a stake in the airline.

   "article_dc_title" : "Kawasaki Steel to Buy ICI Unit",
   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomson in Tokyo and Robert Peston in London KAWASAKI STEEL, the Japanese steelmaker, has agreed to buy ICrs Pennsylvania-based speciality compound division for $100m (Â£57.8m) as part of the Japanese company's attempts to lessen its reliance on. steel prod- ucts and broaden its plastics business. The disposal forms part of ICI's sweeping reorganisation, launched at the beginning of the year, which it says will add Â£400m to annual pre-tax profits by the middle of 1993. Kawasaki said ICI approached. it several months ago. The pur- chase was agreed because of Kawasaki's interest in the pro- duction of heat-resistant, high- performance plastics for cars and office automation equipment. ICI acquired the business as part of the $750m purchase of Beatrice Chemical in 1984. It formed a key part of its advanced materials division, which it hoped would grow quickly. However, competition from other manufacturers was more intense than expected and it is withdrawing from the manufac- tore of many advanced thermo- plastics. In the spring, It announced it was pulling out of production of poly-ether sul- phone, a non-flammable, engi- neering thermoplastic. Analysts believe these plastics will continue to replace tradi- tional materials, such as steel and aluminium, in the manufac- ture of vehicles and aeroplanes. By the turn of the century, the advanced plastics industry is expected to be enormous. It is likely to be dominated by the Japanese because few west- ern companies can cope with the present poor levels of profitabil- ity. Courtaulds, the UK materials group, has also abandoned a huge investment in advanced materials. Kawasaki, Japan's third larg- est producer of crude steel, relies on steel products for about 77 per cent of revenue, and, like other Japanese steel companies, has been looking for opportuni- ties for expansion in the chemi- cals and electronics industries. The Japanese company said basic agreement has been reached with ICI, and a guaran- tee been given that the division's 400 staff will retain their jobs. Kawasaki officials believe that there was at least one other com- pany bidding for the ICI divi- sion, which includes a research facility in Pennsylvania, and four factories, three in the US and one in the Netherlands.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay LAPORTE, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday reported profits that were rela- tively unaffected by recession. The taxable result in the six months to June 30 fell 4 per cent from Â£52.5m to Â£50.m. Sales declined by 10 per cent to Â£302.6m (Â£384.7m) because of the transfer of the trading busi- ness to Solvay, the Belgian group which owns 25 per cent of Laporte. The company enjoyed Â£4m of interest earnings during the period, against a charge of Â£5m previously. Net debt of Â£130m last year was reduced to nil. Mr Ken Minton, chief execu- live, said the recession had a limited impact, other than \"bluntng the growth of most of the divisions. He blamed the income drop on its absorbents division, where there were commission- ing problems at the Fulacolor plant in Widnes, Cheshire. This plant - which makes paper coating chemicals - was now working at 80 per cent of design capacity, but the nine months delay in commission- ing hit trading profits by about zam, Mr Minton said. The division was ai hit by a drop in sales in the m*lecu- lar samve business. The *eak Brazilisn and Peruvian econo- mies hampered the activated earth busines. The share of profits from Interox, the Joint venture with Solvay which makes peroxygen products, fell from Â£17.2m to Â£16.4m. In spite of increasing demand, the company had to absorb heavy capital development and financing costs. The organics division sus- fered from the destocking poll- cies of its customers, but the order book is strong for the second half. The metals and electronics division continued to do well and the wafer reclaim capacity in the US and Europe expanded with further invest* ment. Construction chemicals sus- fered because of the recession but was likely to benefit from the recovery beginning to emerge in the US housebuild- ing market. Earnings per share fell 18 (6.4p) is declared.4p) and an increased dividend of 6.8p (&.4p) is declared.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Robert Peton THE THREE London clearing banks, Barclays, National Westminster Bank and Midland, were last night still opposing any proposal to offer a form of debt security to holders of Brent Walker's bonds. But the troubled leisure group has won their agreement to a set of compromise terms, which will be put to bondholders today. However, Brent Walker's other bankers were not optimistic that the new terms would be acceptable to bond- holders. In order to avoid receivership, Brent Walker needs to secure the agreement of its bondholders to a refinancing plan. Bondholders have been insisting that they swap their bonds for some form of debt instrument, so that they would have influence in the event that Brent Walker needs to be refinanced again in the future. In mid-June, Brent Walker's steering committee of leading banks agreed to a proposal that the bondholders should be offered a debt instrument. The bond- holders accepted these terms. However, the terms had to be approved by all 47 of the banks. Most of them agreed. However on July 5, Barclays, Nat- West and Midland, who together have a relatively small exposure to Brent Walker, voted against, together with three other banks. Negotiations with the three clearers have been continuing. Bankers said last night that a new set of terms, to be offered to bondholders, had been agreed. \"We think we've agreed a reasonable compro- mise\", said one of the clearers. Midland Bank said: \"We have no disagreement with bondholders\". However, the clearers were still refusing to allow debt to be offered to the bond- holders. \"The outcome is extremely uncer- tain\", said a banker. \"If bondholders feel that banks have given up a little ground, perhaps they will be able to accept the new terms\". The clearers are opposing any offer of debt, because they believe it would set an unfortunate precedent. The banks are con- verting part of their loans to Brent Walker Into equity. There is a convention in the UK that if banks are forced to convert part of their debt into equity, then other creditors should not be offered debt or other securities that ranks ahead of that equity. However, there is a consensus among Brent Walker's banks, which are led by Standard Chartered, that in this case an offer of debt to bondholders would have no effect on the value of the banks' exposure to Brent Walker. \"The banks' equity in Brent Walker is valueless. So it makes no difference if bondholders are offered an Instrument which ranks ahead of that equity\", said a banker. The refusal of the three clearers to back the original offer to bondholders in July appeared to call into question the Bank of England's London Approach to company refinancings, which is intended to prevent banks with a small exposure to a troubled company from blocking a rescue. Brent Walker said yesterday that in its current discussions with the three banks the \"Lon- don Approach\" was being followed.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate which has launched a hostile takeover for Racal Electronics, will today send its formal offer document to Racal's sharehold- ers. The speed with which Wil- liams has acted after launching its bid for the defence and security group on Tuesday reflects its determination to keep the battle as short as pos- sible. Last night its all-share offer was worth Â£696m. It emerged yesterday that Williams has already sent a submission to the Office of Fair Trading about how it proposes to shed parts of Racal's busi- nesses if its bid proves success- ful. The takeover raises a num- ber of competition issues which the OFT will have to consider. Williams already has a significant share of the UK locks market through its recent acquisition of Yale and Valor. According to Williams' fig- ures it has about 33 per cent of the retail market (covering pri- vate housing and DIY demand) and 13 per cent of the commer- clal market (offices and facto- ries). This compares with Racal Chubb's 37 per cent of the retail market and 25 per cent of the commercial market. Williams, which believes there is a better long-term mar- ket in selling locks to the secu- rity conscious business world, is willing to shed all of Chubb's retail business and its own Ingersoll factory which makes retail locks. It would retain Chubb's Union Parks' commercial busi- ness. Mr Brian McGowan, Wil- liams chief executive, said the effect of this would be to increase Williams' overall share of the retail market to about 36 per cent, because Chubb's Union Parks business has a small retail side, while its share of the commercial market would remain static. Williams' overall share of the lock market would not be greater than the current mar- ket share of Racal Chubb.",

   "text_content" : "ayRi hrdGouray SHAMRS OF Shanks & Mcewan, the waste manage- m~ent company which In SaUMn. ary bought Recbem, the haz- ardous waste disposal company, for 172m in shas, fell 45p to 2sp yesterday fol- lowing a profts warning. The Iompany said that esar- gs er share for the year to March er unlikely to be materially diffmerent from the last year's 13p, adjusted for the recent share split. The warning means the con- pany has missed by some way its prediction that it would achieve annual 20 per cent B earnings growth, a target it hit last year. Less than two months ago L Mr Roger Hewitt, chairman, told shareholders at the 0 annual meeting that the com- pany would continue to increase its earnings this year at a significantly higher rate B than the market average. He added, however, that it would S1 surprise noone if the growth id rate was below the level of ce recent years. t The profits warning shatters to the previous belief that the bi waste management business is tc recession-proof. First of all developers have LI delayed the rehabilitation of IE sites partly as a result of the (2 recession in the building tr industry, Shanks said. Contracts for the thermal ci destruction of special waste were also being delayed as s' Industry, both in the UK and ec overseas, is cutting costs by bi stockpiling hazardous waste ai that would normally be incin- IN erated. hI There was also a reduction at in the industrial and commer- i cal use of landfill sites. re Mr Hewitt said contractors ti were delaying rather than can- celltag business. Hoare Govett, hI the company's brokers, has cut nai its full-year profits forecast by If Â£5m to Â£4.3m as a result of m the warning. d( Yesterday's share price fall cuts Shanks' rating to near the in bottom of the still highly rated tU sector.

   "text_content" : "I By Jane Fuller Bil Roonev: cash held would be 50% higher than last year's Â£31.3m by year end SPRING RAM Corporation, the kitchens and bathrooms con- cern, again defied gravity in the UK building products sec- tor by increasing pre-tax profit by 25 per cent in the half year to July 5. The rise, from Â£13m to Â£16.3m, followed a 33 per cent increase in turnover to Â£86.9m (Â£65.2m) with acquisitions con- tributing about Â£5m to sales. The share price gained 13p to close at 142p. Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said the profit growth came equally from kitchens and bathrooms. \"If I had to give a single reason, it would be the people involved,\" he said. He had brought 15 directors, from subsidiary companies and the main board, to London for the results meeting to give them a taste of the City. He said market share must have grown in both kitchens and bathrooms from last year's 15 per cent in each. It was esti- mated that the markets were down by 10-15 per cent. While shying away from say- ing that ground had been taken from the leaders - Mag- net and MFI in kitchens, Armi- tage Shanks and Caradon in bathrooms - he did point out that scores of small manufac- turers had gone bankrupt. The group had intensified its marketing effort to builders' i merchants. Mr Rooney said 26 i per cent of sales went through them and he hoped to increase their proportion to between 35 and 40 per cent. Independent high street shops remained the main out- lets for the group and he said i their sales had held up compar- I atively well. In kitchens, fast growth had come from Chippendale, built 1 up since 1989. It launched three I new ranges this year. At the 1 500,000 sq ft Scunthorpe sac- tory, kitchen carcass produc- tion was running at three times the level of a year ago and cupboard-door throughput had doubled. In bathrooms, Spring and Balterley had shown strong growth and were launching new products in this half. The amount of cash held was 73 per cent up on the middle of last year. Mr Rooney said that by December about 50 per cent would be added to last year's Â£31.3m. Interest received in the first half remained about the same at just over Elm. Earnings per share grew to 3p (2.35p) and the interim divi- dend is 0.086p (0.072p). * COMMENT It is perhaps a little unkind to point out that 25 per cent growth is comparatively pedes- trian for Spring Ram. It has, however, proved its worth in a different way by beating the recession. Strong foundations were laid in the late 1980s, when subsid- iaries were spun off that are now benefiting from early spadework. The capital spending pattern has also fitted the downturn perfectly, enabling the group to build up cash while interest rates were high. Only Â£3m was spent in 1989 and 1990 after a bulge that had included the huge Scunthorpe site, still only half used for pro- duction. By 1993, it should be one of the profit engines while the next wave of factories is built. Capital spending rises to Â£15m this year and Â£30m-plus next. The tiny dividend illustrates the group's priorities. Mr Roo- ney says that a 5 per cent yield would cost Â£23m - \"I can build two factories for that\". Investors continue to be attracted by the growth pros- pects, which are recognised in a prospective p/e of nearly 22 on a pre-tax profit forecast for the full year of Â£36m (Â£30m).",

   "text_content" : "Kawasaki's latest Â£59 diversification is good news forICI, reports Robert Thomson AWASAKI STEEL and its fellow Japanese steelmakers have been desperate to prove that they are not an industry in decline. They have built thene parks, developed semiconduc- tors and, in Kawasaki's case, conceived Vision 2000, which commits it to be \"outward ori- ented and aggressively pursu- ing new business opportuni- ties.\" ICI is fortunate to have well-heeled Japanese compa- nies aggressively pursuing new business opportunities, as Kawasaki's $100m (Â£59.1m) pur- chase of the British company's speciality compounds division proves. Kawasaki sees the purchase as a logical extension of its interests in high performance plastics and its commitment to the development of advanced materials. The purchase is certainly more in line with Kawasaki's s-ilg thane ome of its other diversiflicaton projects. The teebafcklir Is a partner in a hopp.ig complex in Phoenix, ArIzona, and has dabbled in the i* Japanese condomin. Kawasaki Steel has chosea electroiles, dmnicals and advanced materials as its \"pillars\" for the future, and said it was particularly interested In the ICI division's work on advanced plastics for use in cars and olffice automation equipment. mum market with a 101-apart- ment complex called Soga Royal Comfort. There is an important domestic reason for these investments and the attempts to build an image as an inter- national industrial enterprise. All of the leading Japanese steelmakers have difficulty attracting young workers and, apart from reducing reliance on steel revenues, interna- tional expansion is intended to bolster their domestic profiles. Kawasaki announced its Vision 2000 plan in 1985. A year later, total Japanese steel pro- duction fell below the land- mark 100m tonnes to 98m tonnes, far short of the 111.4m tonnes of 1980. Companies launched pro- grammes of rationalisation and diversification, as steel produc- tion was expected to continue its fall, though strong domestic growth later led to production and profit increases. The steelmakers quickly tar- geted the technology and advanced materials industries as likely to carry them into the future. Kawasaki establisb ties with LSI Logic, the US - conductor maker in w Nippon Steel has a personal computer, add Kobe Steel has a joint venture with Texas Instruments to manufac- ture semiconductor products in Japan. Kawasaki has chosen elec- tronics, chemicals and advanced materials as its \"pil- lars\" for the future, and said yesterday that it was particu- larly interested in the IdCI divi- sion's work on advanced plas- tics for use in cars and office automation equipment. Japanese steel companies generally have been prompted to review parts of their reform programmes, as entry into the computer and semiconductor markets has been more diffi- cult than expected, and some of their domestic property development projects are being completed at a time of falling property prices. These trends have encour- aged them to refocus on indus- trial opportunities, such as that presented by Id. Kawa- saki said the company was not Interested in acquiring other IdCI operations: \"Our Interest is only in this plastics business. We were not offered anything else by ICL\" The company, conscious of criticism in the US of Japanese investment, emphasised yester- day that it intends to keep all of the 400 staff, and that it has been impressed with the way the division has been run since purchased by ICI in 1984. When Vision 2000 was launched, steel products com- prised 82 per cent of Kawa- saki's sales. By the end of the third Five-Year Plan, the steel content of sales is predicted to fall to 62 per cent, while engi- neering, chemicals and new materials will account for 23 per cent, and new businesses will comprise the rest.",

   "article_dc_title" : "UK Prescriptions Side Helps UniChem Jump 35% to Â£9.7m",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox UNICHEM, the UK pharma- ceuticals wholesaler, reported a jump-in pre-tax profits of 35 per cent from Â£7.18m to Â£9.68m in the six months to June 30. The rise was achieved despite the loss of Kingswood GK, its largest customer, after it was acquired in May by Lloyds Chemists. The 7 per cent rise in turn- over to Â£452.2m (Â£422.4m) was attributed to growth in UK pre- scriptions and success in sup- plying NHS hospitals, even though the recession hit over- the-counter sales. UniChem has nearly 28 per cent of the market of supplying the UK's 11,800 chemists shops. Warehouse automation helped operating profits rise by 11 per cent to Â£9.67m (Â£8.73m). Last year's net' interest charge of Â£1.41m fell to Â£7,000 as the Â£25m rights issue on flo- tation eliminated debt. Uni- Chem, which came to the mar- ket in November 1990, is still about 70 per cent-owned by more than 4,000 pharmacists, who are also its customers. Earnings fully diluted for outstanding share options rose by 11 per cent to 6.2p (5.6p) and an interim dividend of 1.7p is declared. The previous year, when it was a Friendly Society, it paid a distribution to its members. The Â£lm extraordinary charge represented the cost of UniChem's Â£75m bid for Macar- thy, owner of 175 chemists shops. The bid was referred to the Monopolies & Mergers Commission because of con- cerns about competition in pre- scription drugs wholesaling. Macarthy capitulated on Sep- tember 10 to an Â£83m bid from Lloyds, although it also has to gain MMC clearance. UniChem said: \"We see no marked upturn yet but we believe we are well positioned for when the recession ends.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Can EXCEPTIONAL COSTS of M6.4A bkocked Logica's pre- tax profits dowa 58 per cent to Â£8.A for the year to Jane 80 1991, In spite of a 8.6 per Oent rise in turnover to Â£197.7%. In the previous year the proup, -e of the UK's largest com puting services compniules, made taxable profits of Â£1.8m on turnover of Â£190.8m. An unusually heavy tax charge of Â£4.64m (Â£8.53m) resulted in an after tax loss of Â£967,000 for losses per share of 1.6p (8.7p earnings). The com- pany has a net cash balance of Â£15m, however, and the direc- tos are recommending a final dividend of 2.35p making a total for the year of 3.5p, a 3 per cent increase. Mr David Mann, anaging director, said there were ssis of an upturn but he was cau- tious about its effect on the current year's results. Logica's profits have been hit hard in recent years by the recession in the UK and losses at its North American subsid- iary. The exceptional costs and an extraordinary charge of Â£4.23m (Â£1.78m) represent a comprehensive package of measures to deal with the problems. The exceptional item is made up of restructuring costs - some 400 staff were made redundant last year and a fur- ther 50 Job losses are expected by the end of the year - and the cost of three years' rent and rates on officee buildings which the company has left vacant and been unable to let. The extraordinary charge represents both vacant office space and the costs of with- drawal from one of Logica's North American businesses. Mr Mann said that for com- mercial reasons, he was unwilling to identify the busi- ness in question, but it had never been profitable. He said the main change in the company's business profile had been an increase in the level of rice business from 8 ut to 52 per cent. Fixed-price contracts have been a source of trouble for a number of large comput- ing services companies, but Mr Mann said that no part of the exceptional or extraordinary charges were related to the fized-price business. - Government business more than trebled from 7 per cent to 13 per cent and there was a significant Inerease in work carried out for public utilities. 0 COMMOUT There may be light at the end of the tunnel for Logica. It has cut harder and deeper than expected in what must be a final attempt to bring its trou- bled but vital North American business into profit. The high tax charge last year was largely the result of the geo- graphic spread of the com- pany's activities and should not be repeated. Furthermore, operating profits are healthy in the UK and Europe. Ana- lysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of Â£125m this year giv- ing prospective p/e of 16.5. company has taken real- Mili ueasures to deal with its problems - especially its vacant office space - and shouldM be set for recovery.",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd GUINNESS, the international spirits and brewing group, yes- terday reported an 9 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits despite some of the most .'difficult trading condi- tions it had ever faced. Mr Tony Greener, managing iretor of the United Distilers operation, said the rise in tax- able profits from Â£322m to Â£350m was achieved during \"a significant recession\" in much of the English speaking world where the group operates. \"Apart from the obvious effects of the Gulf war, retail- ers and distributers have been running down their stocks. In those conditions a 16 per cent increase in operating profit is pretty good.\" he said. Mr Anthony Tennant, chair- man, said he did not see any signs of an upturn in consumer demand in the UK or the US. About 80 per cent of Guin- ness's profits are made outside the UK. The group's fastest growing market is in the Far East, I which increased operating profit from Â£71m to Â£79m. Mr Greener said the Asia and Pacific markets offered the group excellent opportunities for growth. Operating profit in North America increased by Â£lm to i Â£65m, while profit in the UK rose from Â£69m to Â£75m. The biggest gain in operat- i ng profit was in the rest of SEurope which increased from I Â£65m to Â£101m. However, Guinness is con- Scerned about the possibility of further tax rates for spirits. SDuring the next few months it Sis probable that the European Community will reach agree- i ment on minimum tax rates for wine, spirits and beer duties. Mr Greener said: \"The Brit- ish government has got to take a robust stance in negotiations. Around Â£2bn of whisky sales are at stake. If the tax is increased a lot of jobs could be lost in Scotland.\" Acquisitions worth more than Â£700m have pushed debt up from Â£l.lbn to Â£1.4bn, repre- senting 42 per cent of share- holders' funds. Mr Greener said he was relaxed with the debt level since the ratio of net interest cover bad only fallen slightly from 5.8 to 6.2. Guinness believes it is diffi- cult for small spirit and brew- ing groups to remain indepen- dent without building big brands. Mr Greener said: \"It will be very difficultto remain independent without a niche in the market.\" The board is recommending a scrip issue of one new share for every existing ordinary share. Mr Greener said the group was uncomfortable with being one of the few big UK compa- nies with a share price over Â£10. By halving the share price he believes Guinness could become more attractive to small shareholders. The interim dividend is increased from 5.4p to 6.1p. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 21.9p to 24.7p.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Stalled New Car Market Cuts Davis Service by 30% to Â£7m",
   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger DAVIS SERVICE Group, the r textiles, Ã½vehicle supply and I support services concern, yes- a terday blamed the moribund Â£ new car market for a 30 per t cent drop in interim profits. s Mr John Ivey, chief execu- tive, also warned that there t was little sign of improvement a for the second half. \"We are I not disappointed with current v full-year forecasts of Â£16m to I Â£16.5m,\" he said. Davis made b pre-tax profits of Â£22.3m last c year. v Taxable profit dropped from Â£10m to Â£7m for the six months s to June 30 on turnover down s almost 7 per cent at Â£155m. The dividend is maintained at si 2.73p. ii Operating profits in vehicle L supply and service, which 4 accounted for about 45 per cent e of sales, tumbled by 50 per tl cent. Davis Services, formerly p known as Godfrey Davis, ii intends to reduce is rellance on b this sector and has sold three d of its four Ford dealerships. d \"We will swing lpja ly ti towards being a textile mamte- o nance group in the second half,\" said Mr Ivey. Davis took an extraordinary charge of Â£2.2m, most of which was due to losses on the Ford dealer- ship sale. The textiles division boosted turnover by 5 per cent, although profits declined 13 per cent. The fall in linen hire, which caters largely for the hotel industry, was cushioned by action to cut costs and capacity following the Gulf war. Workwear hire continued to suffer from the effects of reces- sion on main customers. The star performance came from support services, supply- ing hotel, office and hospital labour, where profits jumped 40 per cent. \"Business came in early in the year and we got the benefits,\" said Mr Ivey. Interest charges jumped 37 per cent, because of more cars in the contract hire and leasing business. Income from this division fell some 70 per cent, despite a 5 per cent rise in turnover. The decline in sec- ond-hand car prices was put- ting a squeeze on margins, said Mr Ivey. Education cuts and the con- struction slowdown hit mar- gins in the site services divi- sion, which supplies portable buildings to local authorities and the building trade. The acquisition of Presco, the steel building systems group, in April would have no impact on profits this year. Earnings per share fell to 5.61p (7.74p). * COMMENT Davis appears to be going in the right direction by shedding its Ford dealerships. But that still leaves vehicle leasing, a slack market, which could hold the group back in the short term. Forecasts for the full year are about Â£16m, making a p/e of 12.5 and earnings per share of 12.8p. Next year looks like Â£20m, still below the result for 1990. Wait and see might be the best advice, despite a yield on a maintained dividend of about 7 per cent: there is little likelihood of that rising to any great extent in the near future.",

   "text_content" : "Provisions leave Cala Â£7m in loss PROVISIONS of Â£6m, including 21.53m in land write-downs, pushed Cala, the Aberdeen- based housebuilding and prop- erty group, into a pre-tax loss of Â£6.94m for the year to June 30 1991. Profits last time were Â£3.78m. In spite of losses per share of 15.09p (6.81p earnings) the divi- dend is held at 3.4p, with an unchanged final of 2.25p pro- posed. Mr Geoffrey Ball, chairman, said that the commercial prop- erty and finance subsidiaries in the south of England had been discontinued. He pointed out that the Scot- tish housing, finance and prop- erty subsidiaries remained profitable. Rationalisation had left the company with three trading subsidiaries in its housing divi- sion, based in Baslngstoke, Solihull and Falkirk. They would form the group's core activities, Mr Ball said, on which management and sinan cial resources would be con- centrated. Directors believed that a recovery in the housing mar- ket would be slow. Although the first half would show a small loss, Mr Ball believed the group would achieve a \"much more accept able performance in 1991-92.\" Turnover rose to Â£93.3m (Â£88.5m) with continuing operathms at Â£9L5m. Aoses of associated compa- ales grew to 212Im (Â£198,000), including Â£1.84m from discon- tinued operations. Exceptional items comprised losses on commercial property write-downs of Â£883,000 (nil); losses guaranteed on behalf of joint venture partners Â£3.14m (nil) and land write-downs of Â£1.53m (Â£4.03m). Bemrose static at Â£1.61m Bemrose Corporation, the printing group, reported static pre-tax profits of Â£1.61m in the six months to June 29. The result was struck on a fall in turnover from Â£23.3m to Â£21.5m and after an increase in associated company profits of Â£270,000 (Â£90,000) and a fourfold increase in the interest charge to Â£469,000 (Â£116,000). An unchanged interim divi- dend of 4.3p is declared, pay- able from earnings per share of 6.49p (6.26p). The company said the diffi- cult trading conditions had continued through 1991 and it seemed unlikely that there would be an upturn before next year. William Sindal falls 53% to Â£0.43m William Sindall, the Cam- bridge-based builder and civil engineer, reported pre-tax prof- its down 53 per cent at Â£432,000 for the half year to June 30, against Â£62,000. Turnover fell from 43.4m to Â£33.9m. Mr John Mott, chairman, said the results reflected the observations made in his last annual report about the state of the economy and the con- struction and housing indus- tries. He added that he could see no improvement in the econ- omy which would have a bene- ficial impact on the results for the year. Fully diluted earnings per share were 3.9p (5.48p).

Earnings plunged to 0.2p (11.4p) per share and a reduced final dividend of ip (4p) was proposed for a 2p (6.2p) total. Â£14m French deal for TI TI Group has agreed to pur- chase Cyclam, a leading French maker of engineered seals, for FFrl43m (Â£14.3m). Cyclam, which is owned by Jaeger, a subsidiary of Magneti Marelli, achieved sales of FFrl60m in 1990 when operat- ing profits amounted to FFr2Om. TI plans to invest a further FFr35m restructuring the group and integrating it into TI's existing business. Magnolia declines 46% to Â£273,000 Magnolia Group, a maker of picture frame mouldings based in Southend-on-Sea, saw tax- able profits fall 46 per cent from Â£501,000 to Â£273,000 in the half-year to June 30 in the wake of the recession and the Gulf war. The company said that sales of the moulding companies were similar to 1990, export sales had shown encouraging growth, but publishing turnover was considerably lower. The restructuring was con- thuing and exceptional costs of Â£20,000 represented redun- dancies. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p on earnings per share down 45 per cent from 5.56p to 3.06p.

Mr, David-Weill became chairman of Lazard Brothers two years ago, after the retire- ment of Sir John Nott, the for- mer defence secretary. He is one of the world's most power- ful investment bankers, as senior partner of Lazard Frires in New York and the leading partner of Lazard Freres in Paris. (French law prohibits the appointment of senior part- ners.) \"I consider my job done,\" said Mr David-Weill. \"I wanted to ascertain for myself that the move towards full co-operation of the three firms was realised and to reassure the two other firms about the contribution of Lazard Brothers.\" \"It was a slight inconve- nience to Lazard Brothers to have an absentee chairman, since part of the chairman's role is a public relations one with clients,\" he added. \"As regards the taking of day-to-day management deci- sions, David Verey has been doing that already.\" Mr Verey became chief exec- utive of Lazard Brothers last year. He is 41 and is the young- est chairman of a leading City merchant bank. Lazard Brothers was founded as a branch of the Fench bank 120 years ago. Its chairman has traditionally been British. Mr David-Weill said that, as a Frenchman and descendant of LIzard's original founding fam- ily, he was an anomaly as chairman of Lazard Brothers. He is 58 and will remain firmly in control of the Paris and New York operations. He is becoming deputy chairman of Lazard Brothers. Mr David-Weill said that in 1990, the three houses worked together on 20 deals for clients, demonstrating their new spirit of co-operation. \"Five years ago, we would have worked together on practically none.\" \"I don't believe in league tables,\" he said, \"but Lazard in New York was classified as the leading mergers and acquisi- tions house in the first six months of the year.\" He added: \"In the current year, the decrease in profits is marked and equal in London and Paris.

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller A 17 PER CENT drop in the intake of orders hit APV's sales of food-making equip- ment in the first half of this year and pre-tax profit fell by 41 per cent from Â£24.6m to Â£14.5m. Turnover was 10 per cent down at Â£402.9m (Â£446.5m) and operating profit fell 29 per cent to Â£20.5m (Â£28.9m). Additional restructuring costs - provi- sions of Â£19.5m were made last year - led to an exceptional charge of Â£2.1m. Mr Fred Smith, chief execu- tive, said the latter half of last year had seen the biggest fall in orders for many years. Recession effects were worse than anticipated in the UK and political uncertainty under- mined markets in the Middle East and the eastern bloc. \"Last year we had Â£100m sales in the eastern bloc, this year it will be almost nothing,\" he said. Altogether about 80 per cent of sales lay outside the UK. Other areas where demand had flagged included Australia and China. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said that by June the order book had recovered to a simi- lar level to the year before. In July and August, order intake was more than 20 per cent up. The German and French markets had continued to be strong and the US was showing signs of picking up. However, South America was not good and \"Australia remains closed\". Mr Neil French, finance director, said tighter financial controls and restructuring had cut costs. The workforce had been reduced by 11 per cent to about 12,500. Reorganisation had com- prised sorting out acquisitions made in the late 1980s, dealing with unprofitable operations, particularly in the US, and scaling down in response to the UK recession. Capital spending had, on the other hand, been increased to Â£17.6m (Â£14.3m) as a new sac- tory at Peterborough was com- pleted. Net debt rose by nearly Â£29m to Â£84.7m, gearing of 59 per cent, between the year-end and June 30. A third of that was accounted for exchange rate changes. Shareholders' funds showed some recovery to Â£144.9m (Â£130.4m). Earnings per share fell to 3.3p (5.7p). The interim divi- dend is again held at 2p. * COMMENT In the 18 months since APV gained a new chairman and finance director, the sorting out of past laxity has coincided with the freezing of some mar- kets. They came in too late to prevent a disappointing perfor- mance from a food-related busi- ness, with a broad spread of markets, that should have proved resilient. Since this time last year, when the share price fell by a quarter to 69p, the stock has rightly been rer- ated. Its cash management has improved, the erosion.of share- holders' funds seems to be over and it has taken action to reverse the fall in profit mar- gins. This leaves a better organised company to take advantage of the growing inter- national consumption of pro- cessed food, from buns and yoghurt to fizzy drinks. All of this is in the price, however, after a 32 per cent outperform- ance of the market this year. The prospective multiple is 18 on a pre-tax profit forecast of Â£32.5m for this year. Recovery prospects are reflected in pre- dictions of Â£42m for 1992 and even Â£56.5m for 1993. It remains a hold for long-term benefits.",

   "text_content" : "SBy Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, is hoping to raise Â£40m for Drayton Recovery Trust, a split capital investment trust with a seven- year life. The trust is offering up to 20m preferred growth and 20m ordinary income shares via an offer for subscription, under- written with respect to 7.5m shares of each class. The preferred growth shares, issued at 10Op, will be repaid at 207p when the trust is wound up in 1998, provided that assets grow by 1 per cent a year over the period. The shares will receive no income. The ordinary income shares, also issued at 10Op, will carry an initial yield of 10.4 per cent and will be entitled to the sur- plus assets of the trust, once the preferred growth shares have been repaid. If the trust's assets grow at 1 per cent per annum, the ordi- nary income shares will have no value on wind-up; if the growth rate is 7 per cent per annum, they will have a wind-up asset value of 104p. Personal equity plans are attached to each type of share allowing private investors to hold up to Â£6,000 of either class of share in a tax-free form. The trust will initially invest substantially in larger stocks in the capital goods sector, as a recovery play, but it expects to increase the exposure to smaller companies over the lifetime of the trust. The over- all yield on the trust is expec- ted to be about 6.2 per cent. Lord Rippon, a member of the 1970-74 Heath government is chairman of the trust and Mr Tim Congdon, the econo- mist, is a non-executive direc- tor. Applications must be received by October 10 and dealings are expected to start on October 17.",

Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman and chief executive, said most activities had been adversely affected. The excep- tions were the property divi- sion and Clarke's Crank and Forge, where exports were ahead of the previous year. He added that action had been taken and the workforce cut by 20 per cent since the beginning of the year. The second six months was expected to be better, but annual profits would still be down. Turnover was higher at Â£23.4m (Â£20.5m) with earnings per share coming out at 1.57p (2.34p). The group also pro- vided a pro-forma earnings fig- ure of 1.85p on the assumption that shares bought for cancel- lation on July 1 had been can- celled on December 31. The interim dividend is raised to 0.575p (0.55p). US growth behind Telemetrix rise Telemetrix, the electronics and information systems group, reported pre-tax profits for the first half of 1991 ahead 30 per cent at Â£2m, against Â£1.53m. Turnover improved from Â£33.3m to Â£39.9m, an increase of 20 per cent The company credited a reduction in costs from the reorganisation of its informa- tion systems side and the improved performance of GTL, the US subsidiary, mainly the result of growth by Valor Elec- tronics, acquired in August last year. Earnings per share were unchanged at ip because of Bentalls lower but expects upturn Taxable profits at Bentalls, the Kingston upon Thames-based department store group, fell almost Â£100,000 to Â£207,000 in the half-year to August 3. The result, down from Â£301,000, was struck on turn- over slightly reduced at Â£30.6m (Â£30.7m) and after interest charges of Â£93,000 (credit Â£14,000). Mr Edward Bentall, chair- man and chief executive, said that sales had been severely affected at the beginning of the trading year by the snow, but had improved towards the end of the half. Earnings slipped to 0.3p (0.44p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 0.6p. Boustead at Â£1.04m and warns on year Sharply reduced pre-tax profits of Â£1.04m were announced by Boustead, the manufacturing and technical services group, for the half year to June 30, against Â£2.45m. Mr Tommy Macpherson, chairman, said trading in the quarter to September had been poor and he anticipated profits for the year would be \"signlfi- cantly less than in 1990.\" In the first half, the UK man- agement had to cope with sub- stantial volume shortfalls in a number of key sectors and sig- nificant pressure on margins. Performance had been affected by the recession and fall in business confidence after the Gulf war. Surplus assets had been sold, including Lam Tong House in Singapore. Turnover was static at Â£40.7m, with Bousteadco, the 65.4 per cent owned Singapore- based subsidiary, contributing Â£21.3m (Â£19.2m). Earnings amounted to 0.7p (2.lp) per share and the interim dividend is cut to 0.35p (0.55p). higher minorities of Â£556,000 (Â£206,000) resulting from the improvement by GTL",

Jobs in the division had been cut by a third td about 200, taking the group total to 1,200. Industrial components and distribution maintained profits by concentrating on profit-re- lated pay contracts. Acquisitions made a \"very small contribution. In March the group paid Â£8.5m for the Truflo valve and aerospace component businesses and an initial Â£2.1m for Fslat Fast Pack- aging, the packagaing distribu- tor. The deals were funded by cash balances, which peaked at Â£5m at the end of 1990, and the Â£9.3m rights issue in March. At least Â£2m of the group's Â£3.2m net cash in June is earmarked for the 1993 earnout on Fist Fast. Net interest receivable fell to Â£290,000 (Â£411,000) on lower average cash balances. An extraordinary charge of Â£400,000 reflected the closure of the Manchester operations of Stoneguard in the group's \"controlled retreat\" from build- ing restoration. Earnings rose by 9 per cent to 1.8p (1.65p). Mr Bruce Mclnnes, chair- man, said aerospace orders for the manufacture of complex titanium sheet metal parts should add to profits next year, but other trading showed no sign of an upturn. The 25 per cent rise in the interim dividend to Sp (4p) redresses the balance between the interim and the final and reflects the group's \"cautious but positive\" outlook.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Finnish Authorities Step in to Rescue Savings Bank",
   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Enrique Teasiei in Helsinki and Robert T and John Burtonb in Stockholm FINLAND'S central bank yesterday took over Indirect control of Skopbank, the coun- try's savings bank, becoming responsible for its domestic and foreign liabilities. The rescue was Finland's fist. Mr Esko Ollia, a Bank of Finland director, said Skop- bank \"was too big\" to allow it to file for bankruptcy. Measures are to be taken to restore confidence in the bank's activities and liquidity. The central bank also said Skopbank would be recon- structed to uphold its interna- tional capital reserve require- ments and it would then seek new owners for the bank. Mr Rolf Kullberg, the central bank's governor, hopes control of Skopbank will be \"as short as possible\". Skopbank's general man- ager, Mr Christopher Wegelius, and his deputy resigned yester- day. The action was forced on the central bank by anxiety, over Skopbank's deteriorating financial position. Its four-month result recorded FM85as.4m ($12.1m) in losses before financial items and eight-month Igftres were expected to reveal further dete- rioration, because of mounting credit losses. They climbed to FM96.3m in the first four months compared with FM34.4m a year ago. There was also mounting concern that Tampella, the troubled forestry and metals group in which Skopbank is the majority shareholder, might file for bankruptcy. The latest developments at Skopbank followed a liquidity crisis at the end of last year when the central bank super- vised a FM2bn injection by the savings bank owners to cover potential losses from Skop- bank's investment operations. The crisis at Skopbank is the latest example of troubles in the Nordic banking industry. The problems are the result of financial deregulation throughout the region during the 1980, which allowed banks to increase their lending vol- ume and consequently exposed them to greater risks.. These risks have become reality as f ope l loans, while the recession In Sweden and Finland has added to the credit losses. The Norwegian state has arranged insurance guarantees and other support for the coun- try's leading banks, Den norske Bank, Christiana Bank and Fokus, all of whom are los- ing money. Swedish banks are exposed to growing credit losses following the collapse of several leading finance compa- nies. Of all the Finnish banks, Skopbank has been the hardest hit by Finland's severe reces- sion, which has forced real estate and share prices to tum- ble. The bank also suffered from high three-month Hel- sinki interbank offered rates (Helibor), which have climbed to about 13 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva CS HOLDING, the parent company for the Credit Suisse banking and industrial group, has lifted its net consolidated earnings by 77 per cent to SFr602m ($410m) for the first six months. The strong recovery from last year, when CSH suffered a 78 per cent fall to SFrl92m in its full-year earnings, was marked by a return to profit at CS First Boston, the New York- based investment banking arm. In the first half, all subsid- iaries active in banking had shown a clear rise in net income not only in comparison with last year but also with the successful year of 1989, CSH said. At the end of July, Credit Suisse, the biggest subsidiary, reported a 71 per cent climb to SFrl.33bn in its first-half pre- tax earnings. It did not disclose a net figure but said that, in spite of a significant increase in provisions for problem loans, its first-half net earnings had been higher than in the first six months of the two pre- vious years. The group's total assets rose by 16 per cent to SFr251bn in the first half. CSH said a return on equity of 14 per cent a year had been achieved on the shareholders' equity of SFr8.3bn. In May, after the Swiss supreme court had backed the Federal Banking Commission's demand that CSH meet Swiss capital reserve requirements for all its subsidiaries, Mr Rai- ner Gut, chairman, announced that up to 20 per cent of shares in Credit Suisse could be sold to the public over the next 18 months. Yesterday, he said this pub- lic placement would wait for a more favourable climate on equity markets. CSH's earnings before write- downs, provisions and taxes reached SFrl.72bn in the first half, up by 66 per cent on the year-ago figure. Provisions, taxes and minority interests at SFrl.12bn rose by 61 per cent. CS First Boston, which last year reported a $587m loss after making provisions for bridge loans to several highly leveraged US companies, had posted an undisclosed net profit for the first half which had been higher than expected, CSH said. The parent company had been able to reduce its exposure from $470m at the end of December to $135m on June 30. Over the past eight months, more than $500m of CSFB's bridge loans had been repaid through the issuance of debt and equity, enabling the spe- cial limited partnership set up to hold the loans to pay down 79 per cent of its $650m in bor- rowed capital. CSH said that the remaining commitments should not impair CSFB's prof- its.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkine in Paris LVMH, the French drinks and luxuy gpods gop etra ;M in frt balf but said a strong sal ovey now under way ntdto a \"reasonable\" prof- for the year. An increase in borrowing charges resulting from the puar chase ofextra Guinness shares last year and the acquisition of Champagne P from the rup, befl consdlt dated net profits down to FFrLlbn (l211m) for the first six months, a fraction below the FFrL24bn in the same period of 1990. However, the underlying rise in net income comes out at 7 per cent, adjusting for LVMH's stake in Guinness - nearly doubled to 24 per cent - and for the champagne acquisition. Operating profits rose slightly from FFr2.33bn to FFr2.34bn, within which earn- ings in the second quarter rose by 20 per cent from the compa- rable period in 19M0. LVMH. headed by its chair- man, Mr Bernard Arnault;, aid the seasonal rise in Guinness's and Pommery's income in the current half would reduce the impact of interest costs. Cham- pagne sales-fil' in Britain and the US in the first half, but LVMH usually sells 60 per cent of a year's champagne in the second six months. The rise in the value of the dollar and the yen against the franc in the third quarter will benefit profits, thanks to the large proportion of LVMH's sales in the Far East and the US, said the group. On top of this, trade buyers have reacted well to the recent launch of LVMH's latest women's perfumes, Dune by Christian Dior and Amarige by Givenchy. B I 1 t t t B 1 B B B t Bernard Arnault: enjoylng B strong sales recovery t Broadly, LVMH has seen t sales recover fast from the ) impact of the Gulf war. Cognac f and spirits saw a rise in profits from FFrl.lbn to FFrl.2bn, thanks to continued growth in the Far East - which accounts for 40 per cent of overall group sales - aided by the yen's strength. The luggage and leather goods division saw a decline in operating profits from FFr881m to FFr827m, but is now benefit- ing from a strong sales recov- ery. Profits also fell in per- fiumes and beauty products - from FFrl3Bm to FFrlr21m - but sales through duty-free outlets rebounded in the sec- ond quarter. Financial analysts said the group net profits decline was greater than expected, but that LVMH appeared to be recover- ing from the impact of the Gulf war faster than thought previ- ously. Mr Sylvain Massot, ana- lyst at Morgan Stanley, believes LVMH should easily achieve a 10 per cent net prof- its rise for the year.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkin SAINT-GOBAIN, the leading French glass, pipes and pack- aging producer, has reported a 40 per cent decline in first-half profits. The setback reflects falling prices and weak demand from Saint-Gobain's customers in the building, automotive and industrial supplies businesses. There has been a slight recovery in sales since the end of June, but this is not enough to make up for the strong pres- sure on prices, the company said. Sales rose by 9.7 per cent from FFr34.1bn ($5.96bn) in the first six months of last year to FFr37.4bn in the same period of 1991, mainly due to the incorporation of Norton, the US abrasives group and Solag- las, the UK glass fabricator and distributor, acquired by Saint- Gobain last year. Stripping these out, sales declined by 5.5 per cent. The pipe-making and con- tainers divisions, which together account for an esti- mated 37 per cent of sales, maintained good performances, said Saint-Gobain. All the group's other divi- sions were hit by the economic slowdown, which affected Saint-Gobain's activities across Europe, with the exception of Germany. American earnings were the hardest hit because of the strength of the recession in the construction and industrial supplies businesses there, while earnings improved in Brazil. Group debts rose from FFrl9.4bn at the end of 1990 to FFr21.9bn by the end of June, due to increased working capi- tal needs, the impact of the dol- lar's rise, and the inclusion of debts from Saint-Gobain's recent acquisitions. Finance charges more than doubled as a result, from FFr624m in the first half of last year to FFrl.3bn in the six months to June. Debts represented 62 per cent of shareholders' funds on June 30.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins PROFITS at Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), Europe's leading pro- vider of computer services, plunged in the first half of the year, hit by heavier finance charges and a general slacken- ing in demand. Pre-tax earnings at the French company dropped by 36 per cent from FFr360m ($62.88m) to FFr230m on turn- over up by 27 per cent to FFr5bn. It was difficult to esti- mate full-year profits exactly, given that the bulk of earnings usually arise in the second half, although CGS warned that a \"perceptible\" profits-fall for the year was almost cer- tain. It expects annual sales to rise to FFrlObn, from FFr9.18bn last year. CGS had to pay FFr93m of interest in the first six months, as against FFrl8m of interest received in the same period of last year. This reflects the increase in borrowings needed to fund the acquisition of control of Hos- kyns, Britain's leading com- puter service group, in July 1990. The rise in turnover, mean- while, is mainly due to the first-time integration of Hos- kyns's sales.",

US sta aed guara funds - said that it planned to put in a bid for the failed Executive Life insurance company. Execptive Life of California (ELIC) was seized by state insurance regulators in April, after hefty investment in Junk bonds caused the life company to encounter serious financial difficulties. With 170,000 life policies in force plus 75,000 annuitants and assets of more than $10bn, it was the biggest US Insurance company ever to collapse at that time. California regulators have since been trying to find a solution for the company. Under one proposal, Altus, part of would buy he Jun bond prtfolio for Iher $mlnto ELUC d manage the continuing insurance operation. A deadline of October 11 has been set for rival bids. 1ester- day the California insurance commission said that he belived there wpme three other possible bids in the pipeline, one of them from Europe. oliga claims that its alter- native plan would guarantee ELIC policyholders benefits which were \"significantly bet- ter\" than those of the French scheme. A new company owned by the guaranty funds would take over ELIC's insur- ance liabilities and many of its assets, including the junk port- folio. The junk boldingp would then be \"worked out\" by this company, rather than sold to a I igebuyer. Eren Sarfaty, Noliga's president, said that the pro- poMa IeMuired formal approval &Wfrm t 47 dtate fund -mom- bers, but that \"virtually all\" of tIem, including California, had given their informal backing. He claimed that the plan would offer most EULIC policyholders 100 per cent of their death ben- efits, annuity payments and account values. The French deal would pro- vide a minimum 81 per cent of the cash value of policies and 100 per cent of death benefits, although the former percent- age could increase, partly because of guaranty fund con- tributions.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris PECHINEY, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group, yesterday posted an unexpectedly steep 62 per cent fall in six-month net profits and forecast that full-year profits for 1991 would fall by more than 50 per cent. The decline is mainly due to a plunge in aluminium prices, the volatility of which has tra- ditionally made Pechiney's earnings outlook uncertain. However, this was partly cushioned by a small profits rise from Pechiney's packaging business. Its packaging activi- ties, expanded greatly with the acquisition of American National Can (ANC) in 1988, now account for 44 per cent of operating profits and 40 per cent of sales. Group sales fell by 4 per cent from FFr40.2bn ($7bn) to FFr38.59bn in the six months to June 1991, on which net profits fell from FFrl.24bn to FFr480m over the same period. Operating profits fell by 25 per cent from FFr3.48bn to FFr2.61bn. Profits in the pack- aging division rose from FFrl.llbn to FFrl.13bn. The aluminium division's operating earnings fell by 41 per cent from FFrl.27bn to FFr753m. Meanwhile, profits in the turbine components busi- ness started to fall from the end of last year - though they were up on the first half of 1990 - reflecting weak demand from commercial airlines. Pechiney believes the pack- aging business's earnings will rise by 8 per cent this year, but that \"no real signs of improve- ment are seen for those group activities that are most penal- ised by worldwide economic conditions\". It plans to continue expand- ing the packaging business, while at the same time seeking further improvements in com- petitiveness from the other activities. Pechiney International, the group's separately-quoted 75 per cent owned subsidiary, also produced gloomy results, with a 36 per cent fall in net profits from FFr402m to FFr257m. Pechiney International has more exposure to packaging, which accounts for 68 per cent of sales, than its parent. Turnover at PNchiney Inter- national declined by 1.3 per cent from FFr22.33bn to FFr22.63bn, while operating profits fell by 10 per cent to FFrl.57bn. This reflected, as was the case for the parent company, a strong decline in profits from aluminium and international trading.",

   "text_content" : "By Nikki Taft in New York PROFITS at Federal Express, the Memphis-based express delivery company, dropped sharply in the June-August quarter, the first of its sinan- dial year. After-tax profits were more than halved at $17.2m, corn- pared with $43.1m in the same period 12 months earlier, while operating profits slumped from $129.2m to $80.3m. Sales stood at $1.83bn, against $1.92bn in the first quarter of the 199091 financial year. Earnings per share fell from 81 cents to 32 cents. Federal Express blamed the slump on the slowdown in intercontinental traffic because of the economic recession in its major markets, including the US and western Europe. The results from Europe, it added, continued to bear the impact of a major restructur- Ing in the unprofitable UK operations. This involved the phasing-out of heavyweight and low-priority services in the UK, the closure of certain hub failities and some substantial job cuts. During the first quarter, the loss on international operations overall rose to 3O3m, compared with a loss of $75.9m a year earlier, while revenues totalled $573m, against $605m. Federal Express said that earnings in the first quarter of 1990-1991 had been inflated by some special factors, making comparisons with the more recent quarter difficult. Last year, for example, a strike threat hung over UPS, a rival carrier, while price increases had recently been pushed through in the US market The company noted that the US-Canadian business had fared relatively well this time, and that it still looked forward to increased international demand in coming years.",

   "text_content" : "CINCINNATI Milacron, one the world biggest's machine tool makers, yesterday announced that it was slicing its regular quarterly dividend in half, from 18 cents a share to 9 cents. The move is effective from the third-quarter divi- dend, paid in December, writes Nikki Tait. The company, which has been making losses recently, also said that it planned to take a charge of up to $90m in the third quarter, for which there would be no tax benefit. The charge covers the cost of a management plan involving asset write-downs and the clo- sure of a plant in Wilmington, Ohio. Ohio. Under the plan, Milacron would sell its Heald machine plant in Worcester, Massachu- setts, along with certain prod- uct lines, and transfer produc- tion to Cincinnati. It would also write down its LK Tool subsidiary, which has operations in Derby, England and Detroit, to net reaisable value as it seeks a buyer for the business. The closure of the Wilmington, Ohio, turning centres plant, which employs 350 people, is also planned. In an \"unrelated matter\", Milacron plans to withdraw around $10m in surplus assets hom its UK employees pension fund - resulting in a 84m tax expense in the third quarter.",

   "text_content" : "By Deborah Hairgreves MINORCO, the Luem rg based Investm t arm of Ango Amer Corporation of uth Afrka sawa6 per cent drop in its pre-tax profits to 243.8m in the year tom Jane 80, from $260.4m last year. The result reflects a slight dip In investment income. The company reported a sales Jump for the year to $771m as It proceeded with its strategy of turning the group into an operating company. Minorco continued to ration- alise and restructure Its investment portfolio over the year, which made a significant impact on its operating perfor- mance. Operating parnings increased to $11Om from $5m. Gold production at Minor- co's Independence Mining reached a record level during the year although this was not as high as expected because of the lower gold price and oper- ating difficulties. The company said it had completed extensive explora- tion activity during the year. Minorco is trying to trans- form the group from an invest- ment company into a leading natural resources group although analysts believe it has been dragging its feet on acquisitions. In April, Minorco incorpo- rated Inspiration Resources, the minin company, as one of its own subsidiaries. Minorco also completed the purchase of Canada's Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting from Inspiration for C$100m (US$87.7m). This enabled Hud- son Bay to go ahead with a C$187m modernisation pro- gramme at its Manitoba metal- lurgical complex in order to meet Canadian environmental regulations. In addition, Minorco entered the European aggregates mar- ket through an acquisitin in Germany and bought the EC's only tungsten producer. The purchase of Elbekies GmbH Muhlberg-Prettin gives Minorco access to the growing European aggregates market from its base south of Berlin. It also purchased Beralt Tin & Wolfram, a Portuguese wol- fram producer. The company has put its 47 per cent Interest in Adobe Resources, the US oil and gas producer on the market, but has not yet found a buyer. Earnings per share dropped during the year to $1.14 from $1.35, but Minorco increased its dividend by 6 per cent to 51 cents a share from 48 cents last time.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomson In Tokyo A SENIOR advisory body yesterday recommended: that the Japanese government allow foreign ownership of up to 20 per cent of the shares of Nippon Telegraph and Tele- phone (NTT) and Kokusai Den- shin Denwa (KDD), the leading telecommunications compa- nies. The Telecommunications Council recommendations are likely to become Bills that the Ministry of Posts and Telecom- munications will present to the Japanese parliament early next year, though it is unclear when foreigners will be able to pur- chase shares in the two compa- nies. NTT was privatised in 1986, but is still 65.9 per cent owned by the government, which is required by law to hold at least a third of the company's shares. The government has plans for five further releases of NTT shares, but the weak- ness of the Tokyo stock market and of the company's share price have delayed the sales. Mr Hisamitsu Gannyo, direc- tor of the ministry's industrial policy division, said that granting permission for for- eier to buy NTT shares was not linked to the weakness of its share price, but to the \"international trend\" towards the privatisation of telecommu- nications business. \"We have seen that there is movement taking place in other countries towards creat- ing a better market for the shares of telecommunications companies,\" Mr Gannyo said. However, the committee recommended that foreigners be forbidden from taking \"executive posts\" at NTT and KDD, while the 20 per cent level for foreign shares is less than the 33 per cent foreign ownership level permitted for other telecommunications busi- nesses in Japanese. The committee said that for- eign ownership had to be lim- ited for security reasons: \"These two companies, one of which offers telephone services through Japan [NTT] and another to 215 destinations in the world [KDD], are playing a cardinal role for Japan in the telecommunication system and a particularly crucial role for national security.\" Some prominent Japanese politicians have opposed the sale of NTT shares to foreign- ers, believing that the com- pany should remain a wholly Japanese entity, but the gov- ernment does not want to appear out of step with the international liberalisation of the telecommunications indus- try. The committee noted that NTT has become become active on international bond markets, while both NTT and KDD are expanding the range of their businesses and, particularly in the case of KDD, facing increased competition with the deregulation of the communi- cations industry.",

   "text_content" : "NINE of Japan's 10 second-tier securities companies yesterday forecast losses for the half-year to the end of this month, agen- cies report from Tokyo The revised earnings esti- mates follow a warning from Japan's Big Four securities companies - Yamaichi Securi- ties, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities - that their results would be far below their previous forecasts due to a slump in business on Tokyo's scandal-affected stock market. The smaller companies - New Japan, Sanyo, Kankaku, Wako, Kokusai, Okasan, Cosmo, Tokyo, Yamatane, and Dai-Ichi - also blamed poor performance on weak stock prices during a long period of low trading volume which severely reduced their commis- sion revenues. The smaller bro- kerages depend more on com- mission revenues than the Big Four. Among the 10 second-tier companies, Kokusai Securities was the only one expecting to stay in the black, projecting a pre-tax profit of Y2bn ($14m), down from Y23.4bn. New Japan Securities fore- cast a pre-tax loss of Y22bn, the biggest deficit expected among the smaller brokerages, after a profit of Y6.4bn a year ago. New Japan Securities said that to recover from the earn- ings slump the company would reduce capital spending by sus- pending plans to introduce new computer systems. The eight other second-tier brokerages projected pre-tax losses ranging from Y1.8bn to Yl8.8bn for the six-month period.",

   "text_content" : "By. ~the Brown GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, Australasia's biggest food group, yesterday reported net profits, after abnormal items, of A$110m (US$86.6m) for the year to the end of June, com- pared with a loss of A$86m last year. The result confirms GFW's recovery from the problems which forced the replacement of Mr Pat Goodman, the group's entrepreneurial man- aging director, by Mr Michael Nugent, a former Elders direc- tor. Mr Nugent, who took over in mid-1990, has reorganised the group along product lines, abandoning the previous geo- graphical structure, and has cut costs by selling non-core assets and rationalising pro- duction. He said there was \"still a lot of work to be done,\" but the group was in \"a much stronger financial and operating posi- tion than one year ago\". The previous year's loss was struck after writing off A$202m to cover rationalisation costs, losses on an abortive takeover bid for Industrial Equity, and a 49 per cent holding in Barcora, the vehicle for an executive share scheme. Barcora, in turn, is owned 9.8 per cent of GFW. GFW acquired full control of Barcora for a nominal A$2 dur- ing the year, and subsequently wound up the scheme after selling the company's GFW shareholding. The group said the consoli- dation of the Barcora structure brought A$131m of additional debt onto the balance sheet, partly offsetting cash gener- ated by the sale of Petitio for A$200m and other non-core assets for A$131m. Net profits fell 14 per cent to A$101 after a 15 per cent increase in interest expenses to A$97.5m and a tax bill of A$40m, compared with a tax credit of A$7m in the previous year.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Poster in Hong Kong MR JOSEPH Lau, Hong Kong's controversial corporate raider, has proposed merging his main holding company, Evergo, with its main subsidiary, Chinese Estates, through a partial offer and share swap. This is the second time in two years Evergo, which owns 49.6 per cent of Chinese Estates, has proposed taking over the company. Last time, the offer was rejected by share- holders who complained the offer price was too low. Mr Lau, who owns 45 per cent of Evergo, is offering to buy up to 50 per cent of Evergo shares he does not already own at HK$3.40, the trading price before the transaction was announced but below this year's high of HK$3.75. Mr Lau is offering to buy the Evergo shares so his stake in the com- pany remains above 35 per cent following a share swap. Evergo will then offer to swap every two Chinese Estates shares for one Evergo share. Chinese Estates would become wholly-owned by Evergo and its share listing would be cancelled. Chinese Estates' market cap- italisation is less than half its net asset value. This is partly because Mr Lau is unpopular for regular cash calls and con- troversial asset swaps. If his latest proposals are accepted, Evergo would acquire Chinese Estates' prime properties well below their market value. Evergo said the transactions would turn it into an active investment company rather than a holding company for the stake in Chinese Estates and other listed companies. The merged company would have a market capitalisation of about HK$4.5bn and could tar- get larger investments, the company said. If the various transactions are completed, Mr Lau's stake in the expanded Evergo would fall to 35.5 per cent, compared with 33.7 per cent owned by former Chinese Estates share- holders. There is also speculation about the role envisaged for Evergo by Mr Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most successful tycoon businessman and chair- man of Cheung Kong. In May, Cheung Kong took an 8 per cent stake in the company and subscribed for a convertible note which can be converted before the end of next year at $2.80 per Evergo share. Cheung Kong would then control more than 20 per cent of Evergo and Mr Li is thought to be interested in some of Chi- nese Estates' properties, which are in prime sites and could be redeveloped. * Jardine Strategic Holdings, the holding company for important stakes in companies within the Jardine Matheson group, yesterday announced net profits for the six months to the end of June remained virtually unchanged at US$105m, compared with US$104.3m last time.",

Hudson said most of the increase in profit had been brought about by an abnormal gain of A$54m on the sale to Fosters Brewing of its 50 per cent stake in Courage Pub Estate (Pubco) in the UK. The group said it was taking a cautious approach to the property market and had reservations about the rate of recovery of the recession-hit Australian economy. However, the board said it was continuing to look for opportunities outside Australia following the success of the Pubco investment. Hudson said it would -a I continue to develop existing properties where it could add value, but would view building activities with caution unless substantial leasing pre-commitment was available or a purchaser had been located. The group said demolition work had been completed on the Carlton and United Breweries site in Swanston Street, Melbourne, but plans for extensive extensions could not proceed until local problems had been resolved. The directors said they had decided not to de- clare a dividend, in spite of having cash in hand of A$205m at the end of the financial year. The group has since received a further payment of A$300m relating to the Pubco deal.",

At the short end of the yield curve, the two- year note was unchanged for a yield of 6.17 per cent. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange four-day system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 5% per cent.

The three, five and- 10-year maturity bonds carrying an annual interest rate of 13, 14 and 15 per cent were in great demand earlier in the year. However, sales dropped sharply in August after the restriction was imposed.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown In 8 dney NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB) yesterday said It had been mandated Jointly with Hambros Bank of the OK to arrange a A$lbn bond pro- gramme for the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SIM). The bond programme Is the first to be announced since the federal government relaxed regulations earlier this year which prevented fund-raising in the dom=tic bond market by overseas governments and institutions. Mr Michael Sheehan, NAB head of global interest rate products, said the SEK pro- gramme was likely to be the first of a number of attempts by premium rated overseas Institutions to tap the domes- tic market. \"We are likely to see more of these issues. The World Bank has been discussed as a likely issuer, and other names have been mentioned. It is likely to become a reasonably large market in time,\" he said. Mr Sheehan said the details of the SEK issue had not been finalised. However, the issue would probably be made in tranches of around ASOOm at coupons and maturities reflecting market conditions. \"All these things are price- sensitive, but we are hopeful that something will come about in the not too distant future, possibly before the end of the year,\" he said. The timing will depend partly on the currency mar- kets, since SEK is expected to swap the Australian dollar funds Into Swedish or US cur- rency. SEK Is rated AAA by Standard & Poor's, the US credit rating agency. The opening of the Austra- lian domestic market to over- seas borrowers follows four years of steady growth from negligible size in 1987 to fore- casts of around A$16bn in the current year. Much of the impetus behind the growth has come from the demand for fixed interest investments from managers of superannuation funds set up following taxation reforms aimed at increasing personal savings for pensions.",

   "text_content" : "By Emiko Terazono in Tokyo MOODTS, the US credit rating agency, yesterday announced that it had placed the long-term debt ratings of Japan's Big Four brokerages - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - under review for possible downgrades. The announcement follows the houses' downward revi- sions of earnings forecasts for the first half-year to Septem- ber due to a sharp slowdown in business in Tokyo after the spate of financial scandals. Nomura, Daiwa, and Nikko predicted sharp falls in profits, while Yamaichi said it would incur a pre-tax loss, the first since the mid-1960s. Moody's said that the slug- gish stock market and deregu- lation of the securities busi- ness had prompted the review. The recent stock market scan- dals have increased pressure to reduce the presence of the Big Four and to end current fixed-rate commissions. Nomura is currently rated at Aaa, while the other three houses are rated at Aa2. Moody's added that the scan- dals had not affected the fian- cal credibility of the broker- ages, and that the long term changes nla the financial eavi- roment were the main focus of the review. *The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Japan Securities Deal- ers Association have deded to raise finas charged for vio- lation of market regulatlims.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Italian Bond Contract Takes off",
   "text_content" : "By Tracy Corrigan Trevor Humphri Dealers at Liffe show their enthusiasm for the launch; volume exceeded 15,000 contracts THE first day's trading of the new Italian government bond contract on the London Inter- national Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) surpassed already lofty expectations. SWithin an hour of the con- tract's launch at 8.10am, over 3,000 contracts had been traded, and by the end of the day volume had exceeded 15,000 contracts, with a total value of L3,030bn. Trading was on a one tick spread. The rival contract on the Matif, the Paris-based exchange, traded over 7,000 contracts when it was launched on September 5, and over 6,000 yesterday. (Each Liffe contract is worth L200m, twice the value of each Matif contract.) If enthusiasm for the con- tract persists, Liffe is expected to launch an option on the Sfutures contract. There is also talk that a short-term Eurolira contract may be introduced, though when this was last con- sidered, Liffe members plumped for the successful Euroswiss contract instead. Although initial euphoria is bound to fade a little, dealers were confident that mounting interest in the rallying Italian government bond market will continue to fuel demand for the futures contract. The cash bond market already offers substantial liquidity through the screen-based Telematica system of primary dealers. Traders reported a strong level of interest from Italy, the battleground for prevalence between Liffe and the Matif, since each exchange is expec- ted to dominate its own domes- tic market. But the bulk of business yes- terday was conducted between traders, dealers said. In partic- ular, traders took advantage of arbitrage between the Matif and Liffe contracts. Traders said there was some spread-playing between the German Bund futures contract and the Italian contract: deal- ers sold the Bund for the Ital- ian contract, taking the view that the yield spread between the two markets is set to nar- row. \"There's plenty of end-user interest but not a lot of activity yet,\" one trader said.",

   "text_content" : "JAPANESE business is balking at an ambitious plan by Cuba, facing its worst economic crisis with the end of communism in Europe, to reschedule its commercial debt, Router reports from Havana. Havana wants Japanese companies to reschedule all commercial debt and interest totalling about $1.7bn, and to invest and trade more to help Cuba repay its debts. But the companies involved are reluctant to accept the pro- posals and demand that at least overdue interest be paid immediately. Cuba stopped paying int- erest on its commercial debt to Japan in early 1989 and has failed to make repayments of principal as political changes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have drastically cut its export earnings. According to documents on Havana's debt proposals obtained by Reuters, Cuba's foreign trade minister, Mr Ricardo Cabrisas, told the Japan-Cuba Economic Confer- ence in Tokyo on June 17 that Cuba wanted to suspend prin- cipal andinterest payments and repay loans over five years from 1996.",

   "text_content" : "By SinKM London SOU Afrtica yesterday made to the p-blc debt markets- after a six-year absence, drawing an enthusias- tic response from German investors and more cautious buying from elsewhere. Lead-managed, by Deutsche Bank, the deal was launched at DM800m - already at the upper limits of market expecta- tions - but later increased to DM400m. The syndicate of banks working on the issue was dom- inated by German institutions. Of the 10 lead banks, just three were non-German: Paribas, Kieinwort Benson and Swiss Bank Corporation. The composition of the syn- dicate underlined that buying was dominated by retail inves- tors in Germany. Private inves- tors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries were also reported to be strong buyers. Institutional demand was more guarded. However, Klein- wort Benson's initial allocation of about DM17m bonds was among those increased, sug- gesting that demand from the UK was stronger than expec- ted. An odfficial at Kleinwort Ben- son said that buying in the UK was dominated by institutional investors, raning from well-known pension funds to more specialist fund managers. Paribas also reported buying from the managers of high- yield bond funds in Europe. The five-year bonds carry a coupon of 10% per cent and were launched at par. At this level the bonds yield 1.75 per cent more than German gov- ernment bonds. Many bankers had been anticipating a yield spread of closer to 2 per cent over government bonds. How- ever, the issue traded above issue price throughout the day and ended at 100%. While hopes of a political settlement in South Africa have encouraged some institu- tional participation, the eco- nomic risk. is still seen as sub- stantial by many investors. \"Even the politically agnos- tic remain economic sceptics,\" commented one banker yester- day. . 4ihief among the economic concerns is that any new South African government will be forced to pursue a high-growth, high Inflation economic policy to ensure full employment after two years of deep reces- sion. In its latest annual report, the Reserve Bank of South Africa noted that this year \"higher real labour costs, sus- tained inflationary expecta- tions and substantial increases in the prices of foodstuffs pre- vented the rate of increase of the consumer price index from declining to anywhere near its lower levels of July 1990\". Moreover, political opposi- tion to investment in South Africa is by no means dead. Deutsche Bank and other com- panies Involved with yester- day's issue earlier this month were omitted from the under- writing group for a C$750m issue, the largest Canadian dol- lar bond issue ever made In the International bond market, by the Province of Ontario. Public pension schemes in the US, among the biggest in the world, have also taken a tough line. Earlier this month, two fund management groups, Baring Securities and Genesis Investment Management, dropped plans to launch funds for Investment in South Africa. The companies were concerned that US investors would with- draw funds. Yesterday's bond issue also drew criticism from opposition parties within South Africa. The African National Congress said in a statement that the bond issue would \"take pres- sure away from the apartheid government at a critical time\". Other government-backed borrowers now lined up to tap the international bond market include the Independent Devel- opment Trust and the Develop- ment Bank of Southern Africa. See Letters Page",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London THE World Bank yesterday launched its fifth global bond offering, a $1.5bn five-year issue lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The issue will be priced today to yield between 20 and 22 basis points more than US government bonds, the tightest yield spread on a World Bank dollar bond issue. INTERNATIONAL BONDS However, participants in the deal reported firm demand from the Far East and Europe, including Italian investors for whom the issue is free of with- holding tax. Far from being dominated by the North Ameri- can market, the deal looks likely to achieve broad geo- graphical distribution. Demand outside the US was boosted by the shortage of new Eurodollar bonds issued over the past few weeks and the shortage of dollar bonds trad- ing below par in the Eurodollar market. Falling US interest rates have been matched by lower Eurodollar bond yields, pushing many outstanding issues above face vale in the secondary market. Nomura and Nikko, the Jap- anese securities firms which were excluded from the World Bank deal because of the scan- dals which have shaken them in Tokyo, both lead-managed substantial Euro-yen issues yesterday. The Republic of Austria came with a Y50bn 12-year issue via Nikko, priced to yield 6.25 per cent - the same as the World Bank's outstanding 10- year Euro-yen issue. The pric- ing was seen as very tight by participants in the deal, even in view of the issuers top tri- ple-A credit rating. The bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par but fell to 99.55 bid, outside full fees of 35 basis points, when freed to trade by the lead man- ager. Ricoh, the Japanese electron- ics group, launched a contrast- ing Y50bn 10-year deal via Nomura. The issue, which car- ries a 7 per cent coupon, was placed mainly in Japan and is unlikely to trade. Syndicate managers are anticipating many similar deals from Japanese corpora- tions in the final quarter of this year as borrowers look to re-finance equity-warrant bond issues. Demand for long-dated Ecu bonds is saturated, with Fin- land's Ecu500m bond issue launched on Tuesday still not fully placed. However, there is demand for short-dated Ecu paper from continental Euro- pean investors keen to take advantage of high short-term interest rates. LKB Baden-Wuerttemberg launched a EculSOm three-year deal via Swiss Bank Corpora- tion with a coupon of 9 per cent.

   "text_content" : "o even a casual Tstroller around the i stands, i, ka a that furt motor show marks a watershed between the speed and performance-obsessed B90s and the mnore complex and demand] aenvironmental challenges of the 19M0s. The industry is at a turning point in which issues of envi- ronmental cleanliness, improved economy and traffic congestion are taking prece- dence over more traditional motoring values. \"There seems to be hardly anything the auto- mobile is not blamed for,\" com- plained Eberhard von Kuew- helm, BMW's chairman. But while von Kuenheim was vigorously defending Ger- many's speed-unlimited auto- bahns as helping the country's car industry to retain its tech- nical edge, the main show innovations by the sporting Bavarian manufacturer had nothing to do with speed. They were a new catalytic converter-equipped diesel engine, the E 1 electric car pro- totype powered by sodium-sul- phur batteries and an estate car version of BMW's mid- range 5 series saloon. Volkswagen/Audi, which has just become the first European car company to set up a spe- cific \"environment and trans- portation\" division, was one of the few manufacturers to unveil what might be described as a two-seater \"supercar\" of the type which flooded motor show stands around the world in the late 1980s. However, in unveiling the \"Audi Quattro Spyder\", Ferd- inand Piech, Audi's chairman, depicted it as primarily a design study to demonstrate how the seemingly contradic- tory goals of high performance and environmental \"responsi- bility\" might be reconciled through what he describes as \"intelligent technical solu- tions\". The vehicle itself is unlikely to go into even limited production. The Spyder is, therefore, a demonstration of the alumin- ium construction techniques Audi is expected to introduce into more sedate production saloons later in the decade. The Spyder's tubular alumin- lum frame and body panels are 40 per cent lighter than a steel equivalent and 100 per cent recyclable. An important design element of the package was that it had to be capable of series production without changes to the basic concept. Volkswagen's own concept efforts took the form of the Chico, a compact city car which, it suggests, could pro- Clockwise from top left Audi Quattro Spyder, VW Chico, Toyota AXV-IV and Dodge Neon vide both private transport and form the basis of a \"park and ride\" system to ease urban con- gestion. Only 3.15m long, it has combined hinged and sliding doors for easy use in confined parking spaces. The car is designed to set new safety standards for a small vehicle, with the capabil- ity to withstand a 35mph head-on crash and incorporat- ing protective air bags for both driver and passenger. The front passenger seat can be turned through 180 degrees so that small children can be car- ried facing rearwards. The drive system is flexible, allowing either conventional petrol or diesel engines to be fitted or, as in the case of the show prototype, a hybrid pet- rol-electric system in which a six-kilowatt electric motor operates in combination with a small petrol or diesel engine. The two power units are each linked to the transmission by automatic clutches. The Chico, like the larger Eco-Golf, also on show at Frankfurt, has a gear-change but no manual clutch. The driver merely moves the lever. The Eco-Golf, likely to enter limited production next year, uses the concept to allow its diesel engine to be switched off completely during significant parts of the urban operating cycle, such as rolling up to and waiting at traffic lights. The engine restarts automatically in response to accelerator pres- sure - according to VW, typi- cally around 70 times on a 20. mile mixed driving route. Both vehicles are in line with VW environmental goals of improved fuel consumption and reduced emissions, although VW's engineers have yet to resolve the application of the Eco-Golf system to a pet- rol unit, because of the latter's slower starting characteristics relative to a diesel. The concept of a lightweight commuter car, while still using conventional fuels, is being shown in its most adventurous form, however, by Japan's larg- est manufacturer, Toyota. The two-plus-two seater AXV-IV uses an aluminium honey- comb, magnesium and carbon fibre-reinforced plastics for its body structure, with single leaf spring suspension also made of plastic composites. This aggressive weight sav- ing allows the use of an advanced prototype two-stroke petrol engine, with five valves per cylinder and producing 64bhp from only 800cc. The entire vehicle weighs 9901bs. Innovative thinking about more creative approaches to body design, however, was not confined to European and Jap- anese producers. The Dodge Neon, on show for the first time in Europe, reflects origi nality by Chrysler, the US's third largest car maker, through the \"cab-forward\" con cept to new materials and engines to maximise economy. The main ingredients of the \"cab-forward\" concept are that the engine compartment is made sufficiently small to allow the windscreen base to be .located directly above the front wheels, maxidmising pas- senger space at the front of the car. Part of the concept is alsc to push all four wheels as far as possible to the corners of the vehicle, again to maximise overall interior space. The Chrysler car reflects the belief of Tom Gale, design and general manager of Chrysler's minivan operations, that by the mid-1990s many North American families will be seek- ing family cars no larger or heavier overall than current economy cars. Thus Neon rep- resents a search for a scaled-up North American \"Mini\", capa- ble of carrying four people and their luggage comfortably but within very compact dimen- sions - by US, if not Euro- pean, standards. It is 13.9 feet long and 5.5 feet wide. The sall. engine compart- ment. his been : achieved through an ultra-compact, fuel- injected two-stroke engine of only 1.1 litres. It weighs 40 per cent less than a conventional fourstroke engine of this size, but-produces over 100 bhp - enough, claims Chrysler, to propel the car at 100mph-plus speeds due to its light weight and low aerodynamic drag. The boot can be opened con- ventionally or slid out on roll- ers for easier loading and unloading. The seats can be lifted out, for use as lawn chairs, as can the stereo. In common with other big manufacturers, Chrysler was careful to stress that nearly all components are recyclable, with their materials clearly identified to make the recycl- ing process easier. Even Gale, however, found it hard to con- vince his Frankfurt audience that the Neon's on-board \"trash compactor\" was intended as a serious contribu- tion to clean highways. Neon will never see a pro- duction line. But the cab-for- ward concept and some, at least, of Neon's other ideas will be incorporated in Chrysler's next generation of family cars, carrying the LH code-name, the first of which are due to be launched before 1993. German motor manufactur- ers, in particular, however appeared almost as concerned with the environmental issue of \"unbuilding\" its cars as building them. Since the show opened, every German manu- facturer has committed itself to taking responsibility for recycling its cars at the end of their useful lives. However, the main lesson learned during the operation of BMW's pioneering pilot recycl- ing plant at Landshut during the past year, von Kuenheim indicated, is that the large- scale centralised disassembly factories originally envisaged are not practicable. \"Accordingly we assume that the infrastructure already available for this purpose will be put to optimum use\". In other words, the vehicle indus- try will work jointly with the existing scrappage industry to process used car mountains. Von Kuenheim envisages that each car maker will have the right to choose and advise the waste management compa- nies, and that a formalised buy-back pricing system will be put in place between the scrappage industry and cars' final users. The scheme, sug- gests von Kuenheim, \"would give owners an incentive to keep their cars in good condi- tion even after many years\".",

Optional plug-Ins for the Compaq machines include central processors, graphics processors, disc drives, mem- ory boards and a larger power supply.

The new PCs are based on Intel microprocessors - the 386/25 MHz, the 4861 16 MHz mthe 4861/25 MHz SX and the 486/33 MHz.

Olivetti Systems & Networks, of London, has now devel- oped a commercial product based on be techniques. it has developed a smart card, a credit card-slzed pls- tic card Incorporating a chip, which can store voice impres- slons, and so be used to ver- ify the idmentity of the person trying to use the computer. When each card Is Iss1ued the user has to repeat a series of words three times. Using a special recording machine these utterances are recorded on he chip. When the person then wants to sign on to the PC, say, he or she has to Insert the card Into a reader and repeat the words. The machine allows three attempts before it bare access. The voice print can also be checked over the phone line, if required. Olivetti believes the system will be used In conjunction with other means of access control, such as passwords, and will prove particularly attractive in electronic data Interchange (EDI) applica- tions, to prevent abuse of, say, cheque authorisatlon.

Motorway cones take nearest exit BRITISH prime minister John Major's pledge to remove trafIc cones from motorways could become more of a real- MIy with a barrier system which replaces the traditional cones and amber lights. The Lighthouse system, developed by ILB, of Dorset, comprises high-intensity amber lights built into upright posts. The posts are held in place by heavy bases made from recycled rubber, and linked together by bars, which lock the posts in place. As the barriers will be used to mark holes In pavements as well as trunk roads and motorways, the Interlocking system could even prove the downfall of the cone-stealing thief on a Saturday night.

   "text_content" : "Ahead of next week's Geneva conferenceD4 leavs examines the oil market ORLD OIL demand In the fourth quarter is expected almost to catchup with supply. This gives the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Coun- tries, which meets next week in Geneva, a chance to boost production or reach its price targets for the first time since the Gulf war. It could well do both. Almost everyone agrees the oil market in the fourth quar- ter is going to be tight. West- ern demand is set to rise for the first time this year as econ- omies pull themselves out of recession, and if the winter is cold, supplies could be stretched. Rising demand gives Opec the chance to abandon its quota system since all coun- tries will have to produce to capacity just to satisfy fourth- quarter demand. Opec has informally aban- doned quotas anyway. While it maintains an overall output ceiling of 22.3m barrels a day, actual production has been well above that at an average of 23.5m b/d in the past few months. Saudi Arabia is keen to maintain the organisation's current flexible approach to quotas and there is every sign that the kingdom will carry on producing close to 8m b/d onbarrels per day \"art MMi 25 20 15 10 5 0 Opc p Brantblend cade : BE c *1 (2ndmont proW 1991 Sep oi 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 whatever the conference decides. Saudi Arabia has been rebuilding its floating storage at a rate of 300,000 b/d since August - it now totals 15m barrels - in order to provide a cushion against possible sup- ply disruptions in the last three months of the year. The market will be finely- balanced in the fourth quarter and any further disruption in oil exports from the Soviet Union or a very cold winter could cause a price spike. Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believes demand is being underesti- mated and that companies are not building stocks to the extent they usually do at this e time of year. He predicts a rise i in world consumption to 67.3m B b/d in the fourth quarter. e In the final quarter, Opec i expects a call on its oil of a 23.5m-24.5m b/d, which could Smake it raise its output ceiling t to around 24m b/d. Rising demand would absorb this Sextra production, leaving r prices - currently at$19 a bar- i rel for the Opec basket - t unchanged or firmer. r However, the organisation has to balance this against the t desire of some of its smaller s producers, notably Algeria, to . bolster prices by sticking to e current production levels. Opec e will be sensitive to these views s since it understands the deli- cate position of Algeria's Tinterin'government. Nevertheless, even Mr Gho- lamrea Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister and a former price hawk, has been talking of a rise in output and Saudi Arabia has been pushing this view for several months, which makes it likely it will prevail. \"The market is in good shape, there is more upside potential than downside,\" said Mr Oystein Berenteen, senior crude trader at Statoil. One element underpinning the oil market's current strength is the uncertainty sur- rounding output from the Soviet Union. Soviet exports averaged 2.3m b/d in the first half of the year, according to the International Energy Agency, down from 3.1m b/d in the same period last year. Some industry sources are predicting that the current dis- array in the country could knock production down from the current level of 10.2m b/d to 8 or 9m b/d in two to three years time. Consumption is not dropping as quickly, which could mean the Soviet Union becomes a net importer. For oil market optimists, this paints a rosy scenario for the return of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to the international scene. The market barely flinched yesterday when the United i Nations said it had agreed a plan Ifor Iraq to export $1.6bn- - worth Aol. Iraq's contribu- StIonfo the world market could Stotal 500,000 b/d by the year Send, but this may also be I absorbed by risin demand. i Sanctions are unlikely to be Slifted completely while Saddam Hussein's regime remains in I power and this will curtail the * country's effect on the market I next year. Kuwait is currently produc- ing 150,000 b/d and this will Srise to 300,000 b/d by the year Send. In the meantime, the Brent Smarket for North Sea crude i remains fairly strong at $20.35 t for October delivery. Brent is i in demand since world stocks r of low-sulphur oil are much k lower than those of heavy oil such as heating oil and gas oil. SThe Brent market is unlikely Sto be much affected by the out- 1 come of next week's Opec k meeting unless it is dramatic- I ally different from expecta- Stions. t The meeting's outcome will k be determined by Saudi k Arabia's ability to persuade the smaller Opec producers that it ; takes their price ambitions Sseriously. Their hopes are cur- Srently centred around $21 a barrel. This may mean Saudia I Arabia cannot increase output I as much as it wants.",

The minimum price and the export arrangements will be decided by the jute commis- sioner. India will also export another 50,000 bales to the Soviet Union and other rupee trade agreement countries. According to officials, the prevailing low prices for fibre and the recent devaluation of the Indian rupee make export feasible. However, Bangladesh, a regular exporter of raw jute, has recently dispensed with a minimum export price and will offer stiff competition. What will also go against India is that it is entering the world market nearly three months after the season has started. The export drive will concen- trate on low-grade fibre since growers are finding it increas, ingly difficult to get local buy- ers at minimum prices. But as Mr Rnde, jute commissioner, pointed out, some superior quality jute will also have to be offered to make the package acceptable to foreign buyers. The government-owned Jute Corporation of India and pri- vate traders will export raw jute to convertible currency countries. In the past, raw jute was directed to designated countries. It is debatable whether exporting 200,000 bales will make any significant impact on jute prices in the Indian vil- lage market, where there have been reports of distress sales. Jute mills, which are facing a liquidity crisis, are still not buying jute in large quantities. In a bid to shore up the mar- ket, the Jute Corporation has started price-support operations (buying fibre at minimum prices) in a number of districts in Bihar and Assam. However, as the corpo- ration is facing severe financial limits this season, its market support operation is falling far short of requirements. While the jute commission- er's office maintains the crop will total 9m bales for the sec- ond consecutive year, the trade believes 1991-92 output will not be less than 9.5m bales. Stocks brought forward in the current season total around 1.8m bales. The commission is unlikely to allow imports of raw jute for producing jute export goods as devaluation has made imports expensive.",

   "text_content" : "By HilIary Barnes in Copenhagen IRISH eyes were smiling on August 29 when a European Commission food committee decided to send a consign- ment of Irish and British cheddar and emmenthal cheese to Romania as food aid. But there were scowls in Denmark, as the Romanians had requested feta (a semi-hard salty white cheese which is widely eaten in the Balkans and Middle East) which is a speciality of the Danish dairies, and the Danes therefore lost an order worth about DKr55m (Â£4.8m). The Danish dairy office, which repre- sents all the dairies in Denmark, was swift to point the finger of suspicion at the EC's agricultural commissioner, Mr Ray McSharry, or his Irish staff, for deftly favouring Irish farmers at the expense of their Danish counterparts. The accusation has been hotly denied by the commission officials concerned, who say they were not aware that there were any stocks of feta available, while there happen to be large stocks of cheddar. This has not satisfied Denmark's min- ister of agriculture, Mr Laurids Tor- naes, who said yesterday that he was demanding an investigation into how and why the Romanian request for feta was not met. His predecessor as minister, Mr Niels Anker Kofoed, now a member of the European Parliament, is also pursuing the matter.",

Dealers said the market was gearing up to test upside resistance as the cash price gained Â£13.50 to Â£1.340 a tonne and the three months quotation rose Â£8 to Â£1,333.75 a tonne. In contrast, aluminium traders saw Wednesday's tentative rally wiped out by a $16.50 fall for cash metal to $1,188.50 a tonne, the lowest since the high-grade contract was launched in 1987 .

A report to that effect had encouraged Wednesday's $10 rally. Heavy merchant selling of cash delivery nickel wiped out early gains and sent the price down $137.50 to a 1991 low of $7,487.50 a tonne. The gold price continued this week's slow recovery with a $1.05 rise to $348.85 a troy ounce. Overnight gains in the New York market followed the news of US warplanes being sent to Saudi Arabia.

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dunne in Washington US grain exporters are urging the Bush administration to abandon the set-aside pro- gramme for US feed grains next year so as to help address Soviet food needs and boost US competitiveness and world market share. The North American Export Grain Association, which rep- resents the $30bn industry, warned of \"excessive US reli- ance on acreage adjustment\". Some analysts warn, however, that ending the set-aside could lead to a massive build-up of stocks like the kind which plagued world agriculture in the 1980s. Mr Steven McCoy, president of the association, said difficul- ties in the Soviet market, delays in international agricul- ture trade reforms and prob- lems in the management of the US agriculture export promo- tion programmes have \"seri- ously eroded the competitive position of the US export grain industry\". He said: \"There is a growing realisation among US farm groups that we are putting our- selves in an uncompetitive pos- ture by the degree to which we idle agriculture. The most effective tool the US has from the competitive standpoint is its productivity.\" Mr Richard Lugar, the rank- ing Republican on the Senate agriculture committee, has indicated that September 30, the day the US must announce its crop set-aside programme for next year's feed grains, will provide a key indication of the administration's intentions.",

That was unchanged from its August 1 report but the balance between wheat and coarse grain requirements was reversed at 19m tonnes and 16m tonnes respectively. \"Perhaps too much empha- sis has been given to Soviet economic problems, while insufficient attention has been devoted to the mutual inter- ests of the USSR and major trading countries,\" the council suggested. \"Grain suppliers must realise that shipments to the USSR of all grain in 1991-92 could reach 35m tonnes, accounting for 18 per cent of total world trade in those grains. Since no other market outlets can replace the USSR, then surely the question that needs to be resolved is how these huge requirements can best be met.\" The council said that facili- tating the Soviet Union's access to surplus food supplies in grain exporting nations should be viewed as an oppor- tunity to enable it to play a fuller role in international trade as well as helping to off- set \"the stagnation besetting world grain trade\". The IWC report contained further cuts in 1991-92 world production forecasts for both wheat and coarse grains. The wheat forecast was reduced from the 555m tonnes proj- ected at the end of July to 552m tonnes, while the coarse grains forecast was down to 792m tonnes from 922m tonnes. In 1990-91, world wheat production totalled 597m tonnes and coarse grains production 821m tonnes. The reduced wheat forecast reflected lower estimates for the Soviet Union, China, Argentina and Australia, which were only partly offset by better prospects in Canada and the EC. Coarse grains were cut because of setbacks to production in the Soviet Union, Australia and the US, where severe drought is expec- ted to cut maize output to the lowest in four years. The IWC has lifted its 1991-92 consumption forecast for wheat to 571m tonnes from 567m tonnes in its August report, while it has cut that for coarse grains from 833m tonnes to 812m tonnes.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Prospect of Coffee Agreement Recedes",
   "text_content" : "By Richard MoomV HOPES that the world coffee market will emerge in a signifi- cantly healthier state after next week's London meeting of the International Coffee Organ- isation appear to be fading. Unless they change their minds at a meeting today, Afri- can producing countries will be seeking the revival of the International Coffee Agree- ment's export quota scheme, while Brazil, Colombia and some Central American coun- tries will be pushing for a stock retention scheme as a quicker way of lifting prices out of the present depression. For most consuming coun- tries the re-imposition of export quotas, which were suspended two years ago, would be the preferred means of providing long-term price stability. However, that could take up to 18 months to come into effect and they recognise that more drastic action is needed in the short term. For this reason they may support the retention scheme - under which 10 per cent of produc- tion would be held back - as a stop-gap measure. That scheme would have to operate outside the interna- tional agreement if a similar delay was to be avoided, and that would mean securing independent finance. Brazil is expected to release $144m of blocked coffee sector financing for the purpose but other coun- tries' would have to seek funds from private institutions, and it is for that reason that the approval of ICO consumer members is important. The bulk of Latin American arabica coffee producers need a price rise of about 12 cents to $1 a lb to get back to the break-even level and another 10 cents to be \"at all comfort- able\", according to Mr Law- rence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London futures trader. And he says most Africans, produc- ers of the coarser robusta vari- ety, would need 60 cents a lb, 18 cents above the present level, to make a modest profit. A recent rise encouraged by worries about dry weather in Brazil, by far the biggest pro- ducer, has been trimmed back this week and little reaction was seen yesterday to a Brazil- ian Ministry of Agriculture forecast that the 1992-93 crop would be 30 per cent down on the current season. Mr Eagles explained that traders tended to take little notice of early Brazilian fore- casts. At this time last year, he noted, the ministry forecast a crop of 22m bags (60 kg each) for the 1991-92 season, which yesterday it estimated at 26.8m bags. No realistic forecast for 1992-93 would be available until December or January, he suggested.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Mooney HAPPIER DAYS lie ahead for cocoa producers, according to a market analysts' report pub- lished yesterday. \"We believe the market is now entering a new phase,\" said the Gill & Duffus Cocoa Market Report published by E.D. & F. Man. \"It is moving from a long sequence of [pro- duction] surplus years which has led to a sustained down- ward trend in prices, to a sequence of deficit years which will reduce stocks and lead to a sustained upward trend in prices.\" The report forecast that stocks would be reduced in the 1991-92 season by 148,000 tonnes to 1.34m tonnes, ending a seven-year run of increases that lifted stocks from 463,000 tonnes to a record 1.49m tonnes. It noted that the last time a prolonged period of structural surplus ended, in the mid- 1960s, seven consecutive years of surplus were followed by four years of deficit. Gill said the forecast decline mainly reflected reduced pro- duction prospects in Brazil because of the cumulative effects of poor husbandry and reduced inputs of fertilisers and pesticides resulting from unremunerative prices. The same factor was expected to cut crops in West Africa, where dry weather was also hitting yields. \"Only in Indonesia does there appear to be the potential for substantial growth,\" it added, \"and even here this potential may be curbed by the effects of recent dry weather.\" The report put the gross world crop in 1991-92 at 2.32m tonnes, which was reduced to a net 2.3m tonnes after allowing for loss of weight in process- ing. That compares with 1990-91's net output of 2.43m tonnes. Seasonal bean grind- ings, the standard indicator of consumption, were forecast to rise from 2.33m tonfles to 2.45m tonnes. Gill also reduced its estimate of the 1990-91 production sur- plus to 102,000 tonnes, com- pared with the 139,000 tonnes it was forecasting in its May report. It said the decline in the size of the overall surplus since 1988-89's 321,000 tonnes would have been greater but for a significant increase in Indonesian production.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Dollar Continues to Recover",
   "text_content" : "THE D0LA4R maintained its recent recovery nto technical trading yesterday, as short positions.were covered, but sentient did not appear to have turned in favour of the currency. '~ A widening ofat the US trade deficit to $5.o0bn in July from from June's revised shortfall of $3.79bn had little impact. The revision from $4.02bn took the June figure down to the small- est deficit since March 1983, but July's data showed that imports of cars and consumer goods has resumed. The news did not cause much surprise however, with most economists looking for a July deficit of around $5.00bn A fall of 17,000 to a season- ally adjusted 402,000 in new applications for US unemploy- ment insurance benefits in the week to September 7 was also largely Ignored by the market. At the London close the dol- lar had climbed to DM1.6890 from DM1.6815; to Y134.45 from Y134.20; to SFr1.4780 from SFrl.4685; and to FFr5.7550 from SFr5.7275. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index rose to 65.1 from 65.0. Sterling finished towards the top of the day's range against the D-Mark, supported by indi- cations that the UK is moving out of recession. Wednesday's comments by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, overno Ikf\"the Bank of an i g nd to thi recessinwer roiowea oj a rise in M4Wlending by banks and building ocetes during August The rise of Â£8.6bn in M4 lending was towards the top of market estimates and Included an increase in lending to the personal sector. A fall of 0.1 per cent in seasonally adjusted MO money supply was in line with expectations, but the rise of 0.3 per cent in M4 money supply was a little lower than most forecasts. Speculation about a possible UK general election in Novem ber tended to fade after Mr Chris Patten, chairman of the ruling Conservative Party, said an election campaign was \"some way off.\" Sterling fell 30 points to $1.7285 against a stronger dol- lar, but rose to DM2.9200 from DM2.9125; to FFr9.9475 from FFr9.9175; to SFr2.5550 from SFr2.5425; and to Y232.50 from Y282.25. The pound's index closed 0.1 higher at 91.0 after trading at 90.9 for most of the I the European exchange rate mechanism sterling was steady as the third weakest currency. The D-Mark rose above the Italian lira returning to third strongest place in the system. There were no new sac- tors to influence the D-Mark, with the market expecting it to remain firm on economic trends and the wide differen- tial between Gerian and US interest rates. The Spanish peseta was steady at the top of the ERM, unmoved by news that Spain will eliminate all remaining controls on capital movements by the end of this year. The Canadian dollar showed little reaction to a fall in Can- ada's July trade surplus to C$63m from a downward revised surplus of C$822m in June. c IN NEW YORK Sp. 19 Close ve Â£5=o ......... 1.7295-1.7305 1.7285-1.7295 Imoh....... 072-0.70p0 073-072pm 3mntls...... 12.00.197pm 197-195P 12months.... 6.60-6.50p 6.60-6.55pn Forward premiums and discounts apply to the US dollar STERLING INDX Sep.19 Previous 830O am .......... 90.8 91.1 9.00 am ........... 90.8 91.1 10.00 am ........... 90.9 91.0 11.00 am ........... 90.9 91.0 Noon ............. 90.9 91.1 1.00 pm ........... 90.9 91.0 2.00 pm ........... 90.9 90.9 3.00 pm . 90.9 90.9 4.00 pm . 91.0 90.9 CURRmmcV MOVEMNNTS Sep 19 Bank of M ty 91.0 -20.7 r .............. 65.1 -14.1 ClaDollar. 106.1 +3.4 AusrilSdchillingl. 109.3 +11.6 B Â« Fanc..... 110.8 -2.4 lI4Krone M4 +3.1 Mark .................. 117.4 +24.2 Swim Franc............. 109.3 +1813 DtchGldler........... 113.6 +15.6 French Franc............ 12.2 -13.5 lUr n . 98.6 -19 Ye . 138 3 +70.9 1 G 1arant changes: averag 190,192-100.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street FUTURES-RELATED program buying sparked off a mid-ses- sion rally, sending equities broadly higher on reasonably heavy volume, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3024.37, up 6.48, on volume of 211m shares and on the big board, advanc- ing issues led declining stocks by a ratio of 897 to 657. The more representative Standard & Poors 500 closed at 387.56, up 0.62, while the Nasdaq compos- ite of secondary stocks climbed 4.12 to 522.67 The morning's activity was spurred by today's \"triple witching\", when stock-index futures and options and options on individual stocks all expire. Although the Dow has held above the 3,000 level all week, yesterday's gain was not a reflection of underlying market sentiment. Royal Dutch Shell slid $% to $81% in exceptionally heavy trading, on news that the com- pany's Shell Western E&P unit is pulling out of Alaska after spending about $140m with its partners to explore for oil off the Alaskan coast. The oil and gas properties are up for sale. Federal Express moved up $% to $36% despite turning in first quarter earnings of 32 cents a share, sharply below the 81 cents reported a year. Eli Lilly eased $% to $82'/%. after Merrill Lynch cut its earnings estimate for the com- pany. Other drug companies, however, posted gains , includ- ing Merck, up $% at $131%, and Pfizer, $% higher at $65%. Helene Curtis, a personal care products company, climbed $1% to $39% after Kid- der Peabody initiated research on the stock with a \"buy\" rat- ing. Among the most actively NYSE volume DaNy (miNNon) 5 6 9 10 11 12 13 16 17 18 19 September 1991 traded blue chip issues, Ameri- can Telephone & Telegraph added $% to $38% while IBM fell $% to $104%. In over-the-counter trading, Regeneron soared $3% to $16 in heavy trading after an analyst at Southview Financial Group repeated a \"buy\" rating on the stock and described it as one of the best short-term buys among biotechnology issues. Adobe Systems soared $6% to $51'/a after reporting third quarter earnings of 55 cents a share against 45 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected the print and graphic software systems company to post earn- ings of about 53 cents a share. Disappointing earnings from LTX Corp pushed the issue $1m lower to $21. LTX turned in net income of 8 cents a share for the fourth quarter, below the 12 cents a share most ana- lysts had expected. Canada ____ TORONTO prices continued their lacklustre performance, ending little changed in moder- ate trading. According to preliminary fig- ures, the composite index was off 6.55 to 3,411.93 as declines edged advances by 255 to 250. Volume rose to 22.5m shares from the previous 17.5m and trading value was C$226m against C$194.4m. Central Capital and Central Guaranty Trustco issues rose after a Toronto newspaper said BCE Inc. was the front-runner to buy Central Guaranty. Cen- tral Capital called the report \"sheer speculation\" and BCE declined comment. Central Capital's common shares were up C$.30 to C$2.10, the A shares rose C$.51 to C$1.81, the pre- ferred A jumped C$2'/% to C$8% and the preferred B jumped C$1% to C$7%. Central Guar- anty was up C$1% to C$8% and BCE was off C$'% to C$431%. Pinnacle Resources was an active trader, ending unchanged at C$7%. The com- pany said it will sell 2m special warrants at C$7.55 each, with the warrants exchangeable for an equal number of common shares.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo MORNING gains were eroded yesterday as rumours that a speculative investor had been arrested prompted some profit- taking, writes Emiko Teramzono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed only a net 14.53 up at 23,332.31 after rising to a high for the session of 23,581.60 in the morning. The day's low was 23,219.83. Volume was unchanged at 600m shares. Trading by indi- viduals and dealers was evi- dent, while some foreigners took profits. Losses finally out- numbered gains by 541 to 482, while 144 issues were unal- tered. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.34 to 1,795.81, but in London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 12.00 to 1,373.68. Prices rose sharply in early trading, with speculative stocks leading the way. Heavy selling was triggered in the afternoon by rumours that a prominent speculative investor had been arrested and that a non-bank financial institution had gone bankrupt. Traders suggested that, because inves- tors in stock-index futures options can execute rights every Thursday, some dealers might have circulated rumours to send prices lower. Speculative stocks were vola- tile on the rumours. Meiji Seika, the most active issue of the day, touched extremes of Y1,420 and Y1,290 before clos- ing Y80 up at Y1,380. Honshu Paper advanced Y79 to Y980. Financial institutions were seen cross-trading - selling stocks to realise profits and buying them back at the same price to maintain the portfolio - bef6re the interim book-clos- ing. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &Drew said he expec- ted active window-dressing in small-capital issues with low liquidity next week. Dainippon Ink & Chemicals, the printing company, jumped by its daily limit of Y100 to Y635. Reportsthat it had devel- oped a chemical capable of restricting the effects of Aids prompted heavy buy orders. Snow Brand Milk, the dairy producer, climbed Y35 to Y985 on reports that it was co-devel- oping a treatment for Alz- heimer's disease. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 26.48 to 25,903.07 as volume surged from 138m shares to 234.5m, the first time it has exceeded 200m since Sep- tember 1990. Traders attributed the activity to cross-trading. Roundup ANOTHER SHARP fall in Jak- arta extended its loss so far this week to 122 per cent. Most other markets in the region were also weak yesterday. JAKARTA dropped 4.4 per cent as foreign investors con- tinued to sell. The index fell 12.27 to 259.29 on volume of 4.6m shares. Astra Interna- tional lost a further 1,500 rupiah to 10,750. BANGKOK shed 2 per cent on worries about the Gulf and fears of heavy selling by big investors. The SET index slipped 14.60 to 703.88 in turnover of Bt3.6bn. KUALA LUMPUR eased as investors stayed out of the market before a long weekend, starting today. The composite index dipped 5.10 to 524.20 in turnover of M$85m (MS70m). Oriental Holdings, the assembler for Honda vehicles, fell 95 cents to M$S.95 as ana- lysts downgraded their full- year forecasts after its six- month results. Pengkalen Industrial Hold- ings, which made its debut yes- terday, topped the actives list with 4.8m shares traded. It closed at M$2.70 - a premium of 80 cents over its offer price. NEW ZEALAND fell on wor- ries about corporate earnings. Magnum dropped 15 cents or 8.2 per cent to NZ$1.68, com- pared with a 1991 high of NZ$3.15, after its subsidiary, Wilson Neill, told the stock exchange that its profits report on Monday is likely to affect its share price adversely. Wil- son lost 3 cents or 10.7 per cent to 25 cents. The NZSE-40 index declined 6.69 to 1,403.15. SEOUL failed to be encour- aged by government measures to boost the economy, as they fell short of providing aid to cash-strapped small and medium-sized companies. The composite index eased 1.79 to 683.70 in slow turnover of Wonlo04bn, against Wonl54bn. SINGAPORE closed mixed on thin trading. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 0.51 to 1,384.83 in turnover of S$66m. Foreigner shares in Singapore Airlines fell 40 cents to S$19.60 on reports that a large block of shares was being privately placed. HONG KONG extended its losing streak to a fourth day as foreign investors were said to be switching funds to Tokyo. The Hang Seng index tumbled 36.80 to 3,863.68 in turnover of HK$1.22bn, up from HK$927m. AUSTRALIA rose as the domestic dollar eased back. The All Ordinaries index gained 4.6 to 1,557.6 in steady turnover of A$254m. BHP put on 10 cents to A$13.80 ahead of its quarterly results, due today.",

   "text_content" : "HINGS ARE 1o, ing pretty glum on the Milan stock market. Turnover is sharply down after a recent stock fraud scandal that alienated domestic\"and foreign investors and, now that the general election has been slated for next May, the ur- rent government is less keen to push ahead with unpopular but necessary fiscal legislation. Italy has been one of Europe's worst performers this year. According to the FT-Ac- tuaries indices, it has climbed by only 5.4 per cent in 1991, well behind the 16.6 per cent for Europe excluding the UK. So far this quarter, Italy is down by 6.8 per cent, compared with a rise of 0.5 per cent for the rest of the Continent. The government's inability to reduce the public sector defi- cit, and the delay in parlia- ment's approval of stock mar- ket reforms to protect rights of minority shareholders, make it difficult for brokers to per- suade investors to return. Yet analysts are saying that Italian equities are ripe for a temporary recovery. \"Milan is due for a short-term, technical rally,\" says Mr Enrico Ponzone at Kleinwort Benson Securi- ties. Mr Nicol6 Braendll, a director at Milan brokers Bossa Solblati, believes the negative factors have been discounted. \"I do not see a big downside risk at current price levels,\" he says. The depth of the share price decline has prompted Mr Step- hen Reitman at UBS Phillips & Drew, a seller of the market leader Fiat since 1987, to change his recommendation to hold. In the past five years, Fiat's share price has halved from above L12,000 to under L6,000; it peaked at over L15,000 in 1986. An upturn in the market could come after the interim results of Flat, due on Septem- ber 26, and of Olivetti, the day after. Both sets of results are expected to be bad, even loss- making in Olivetti's case, owing to the difficult trading conditions in the car and com- puter industries. Precise half-year forecasts are not readily available. Esti- mating even the full-year results of Italian companies is a bit like shooting in the dark. This year, Fiat's true earnings will be veiled by a LO00bn ($66m) gain from selling its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary to Alcatel Alsthom, of France. FT-A Word Indices in local currencies (Dec.31 1986-100) 1W0 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 5a AugS 87 88 89 90 91 Soum: -Datastawn ------ Mr Francesco Riciulli at Paribas Capital * Markets believes any progress in the wage talks between unions, employers and the government during the next month will be a positive signal for the mar- ket. Wage increases have been running at between 11 and 15 per cent, well ahead of infla- tion at around 6 to 7 per cent. With state employees accounting for about one-fifth of Italy's workforce, this puts an unbearable strain on public finances. At the same time, high unit labour costs make Italian industry less competi- tive. \"A real increase of 1 to 2 per cent would be good news,\" Mr Riciulli says. But the bourse's future can only improve if its fundamen- tal problems are solved. Ana- lysts agree that foreign inves- tors will only discard their negative attitude towards Ital- ian equities when stock market reforms are enforced, and when there is evidence that the government is coming to grips with the public sector deficit. Milan is now one of the last bourses in Europe still to intro- duce continuous share trading, a facility which is now avail- able in Portugal. Milan's exper- iment with continuous trading has been delayed by technical difficulties. A reduction in state borrow- ing would raise the profile of the Milan bourse, which is dwarfed by the huge bond mar- ket. Analysts hope that the presence of European Commu- nity observers at the Italian Treasury during current talks to draw up the 1992 budget will be the catalyst. Meanwhile, Italian equities have great difficulty in compet- ing with bonds for Investors' money, since the state's bor- rowing needs keep the returns on fixed-income instruments artificially high and create a far more liquid market. Official average daily turnover on the bourse is just L60bn ($47m), compared with L9,000bn on the bond market. Family and state holdings in companies also restrict the Milan bourse, where only half the listed shares are free-float. According to Kleinwort Ben- son, the capitalisation of the Milan stock market was equiv- alent to only 16 per cent of Italy's gross domestic product in 1990, against 97 per cent for the bond market. This com- pares with 23 per cent and 61 per cent respectively in Ger- many, 24 per cent and 56 per cent in France and 90 per cent and 28 per cent in the UK.",

   "text_content" : "CORPORATE NEWS and an early rise on Wall Street lifted several bourses yesterday. Telecommunications stocks featured in France and Spain, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS recouped an early loss to close at its third 1991 high this week. The CAC 40 index finished 10.95 up at 1,880.36, recovering from a day's low of 1,859.40. Turnover was fairly active at FFr2.3bn. In telecoms, Alcatel Alsthom gained FFr21 or 3.6 per cent to FFr607 on volume of 434,230 shares. The rise followed the previous day's better-than-ex- pected first-half results. CSEE, the electronics com- pany facing a takeover bid from Quadral, jumped another FFr26.80 or 15.9 per cent to FFrl95. The stock exchange authorities said that Fin- meccanica of Italy and Groupe- ment Privd de Gestion had raised their stakes in CSEE on Wednesday. R6my & Associds advanced FFr17.90 or 7.3 per cent to FFr262.50. The drinks group announced plans to merge with Pavis, the family-owned con- cern that controls production and distribution of R6my Mar- tin cognac and Cointreau. On the downside, Printemps fell FFr31 or 3.5 per cent to FFr855 on reports that Maus Frbres, the Swiss holding com- pany, would not have to sell its stake. Among companies announcing interim figures, LVMH rose FFr21 to FFr4,092 and Saint-Gobain, which reported a sharp profits fall late in the day, added FFr5.90 to FFr478. MADRID was again inspired by Telef6nica, the telecoms group, which jumped another Pta50 or 4.5 per cent to Ptal,165 after Wednesday's news of a change in dividend policy. Trading volume in the stock almost doubled from the previ- ous day's heavy 5.88m shares to 10.8m. Again, Telef6nica accounted for well over half of the total market turnover of about Ptal9bn, up from Ptal3.8bn. The general index was barely changed, adding 0.38 to 272.99. In the banking sector, BBV rose Pta50 to Pta3,155 in active trading, while Banesto slipped Pta5 to Pta3,785. The two banks, which have held talks together, denied rumours that they had agreed to merge. MILAN held on its early gains as continued demand for the insurer, Generali, spilled into the rest of the sector. The Comit index rose 2.37 to 554.67 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's L96bn. Generali, which launched its L1.75 trillion capital increase this week, added L730 to L27,400 in arbitrage-related trading. The rights rose L229 or 6 per cent to AL4,030. The insur- ance sector index was up 1.7 per cent while other sectors were flat. Olivetti closed L36 lower at L3,134, before falling to L3,125 after hours. Fiat was fixed IA40 higher at L5,575, but later fell back to L5,520. FRANKFURT consolidated Wednesday's post-bourse losses, the DAX index closing 7.37 lower at 1,620.70 after a 3.87 fall to 671.29 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell from DM4.5bn to DM3.9bn. However, Wall Street's early improve- ment helped the German com- ponent of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index to recover, standing virtually unchanged at the London post-bourse close. In Frankfurt, Mr Detlev Klug of B Metzler observed that Sie- mens, which was quoted DM4.60 lower at DM638 at the session close, was DM640 and rising in the afternoon. The company said that it expected to lose DM100m in East Ger- many in 1991-92. But Mr Klug said that this was about 6 per cent of Siemens' expected net income for that year, and it was the price it might be expected to pay for entry into a brand new market.

The fall- ing dollar, the US luxury goods tax, a boardroom resignation and the company's lack of suc- cess in the Formula One racing market were outweighed Daim- ler's expressed willingness to buy up to 30 per cent of the company. ZURICH steadied after a 77 per cent rise in first half prof- its at CS Holding, which left the bank holding company's bearer shares SFr3SO higher at SFr2,070, and the Crddit Suisse index unchanged at 520.6. STOCKHOLM moved lower across the board in spite of fall- ing interest rates. The Affars- varlden General index closed at 1076.1, down 5.1, as turnover eased to SKr254m from SKr282m. Astra's free B shares dipped SKr11 to SKr545. AMSTERDAM recouped part of the day's losses but trading was thin. The CBS tendency index closed 0.2 lower at 91.6, having been as low as 91.4. Some stocks bucked the trend. PolyGram, Philips' music subsidiary, put on 30 cents to Fl 40.30 and the brewer, Grolsch, advanced 50 cents toFl 180.",

   "text_content" : "Py Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor A HIGHLY erratic trading performance saw the London stock market rally from early losses yesterday. to record its first positive session for the past four days. In early trad- ing, equities fell by 19 FT-SE points to below the nearest chart support level. Market turnover remained linked to specific stocks and support faded towards the close on unspecified fears of further bearish developments today. Shares were helped initially by wider dissemination of the statement from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Gover- nor of the Bank of England, that the UK economy was emerging from recession. How- ever, the shine dimmed as traders noted that the Gover- nor had also referred some- what coolly to prospects for A-- --Â» D1 Sep rep cton i O Oti c 1 606M-l-- day allow. interest rates. There was only muted response yesterday to the announcement that domestic bank lending increased by Sep3hÂ» Oat? Oct21 HyI s.bn in August, a touch below furthe City's expeductations n domestic interest rates. There wasery only the corporamute responset deepened as RMCto the announcement that domestic bank lending increased by Â£3bn in August, a touch below the City's expectations. The misery on the corporate front deepened as RMC, the construction industry group, and Hawker Siddeley delivered fresh blows to investment con- fidence, although shares in Hawker soared after a poor Interim report inflamed this week's renewed takeover spec- ulation. Heavy turnover in Asda, the food supermarket company, suggested that the profits and dividend warnings of the previous day might have inspired stake-building operations. Equities opened firmly as some traders took the view that Wednesday's selling had been overdone. But they were soon proved wrong, for the time being at least, when hints that the large overseas seller recently depressing UK share prices had reappeared sent the market spiralling downwards. The rout was also triggered by a fall in the FT-SE Septem- ber futures contract, which moved below 2,600. The futures contract has maintained a r healthy premium to the under- Slying cash Market for the past few days, and the of m blue chip equities to respond t had opened up an alaring e spread between the two mar- a kets, sparking off yesterday's e selling of the future. g Nervousness increased as the FT-SE Index plunged a through the 2,575 support area, v to touch 2,564.5 at the day's d lowest level. The seller then e withdrew and equities, helped e by gains in a handful of Foot- a sie stocks, turned upwards r again. By the close the FT-SE e was ahead 5.1 on the day at a 2,588.7. Among the brighter spots d was British Aerospace, after 1- reports that a presentation to h analysts in Scotland had gone s down better than similar pre- a sentations in London. Glaxo, Reuters and Hawker Siddeley theoted the FT-SE Index, iat4be market as a whole. Sepq-reported turnover in e~d to 677.6m shares fm 673.2m of the previous day.OYesterday's session took in heavy trade in BAT Indus- tries (9.m shares) and Asda (88m), as well as in a number of other active features. In spite of the modest rally in the Footsie, there appeared to be little recovery in market confidence yesterday. Share prices lost impetus in late deal- ings as hints swirled around the market of further bearish developments ahead; sugges- tions ranged from more rights issues to further downgradings of profits forecasts by broker- age analysts, who have this week seen company results turning out below predictions.",

   "text_content" : "JUST ONE day after warning of a \"very significant deteriora- tion\" in current-year profits, almost 7% per cent of Asda equity changed hands, fuelling speculation that a bid may be in the offing for the Leeds- based grocery chain. The shares were initially marked 12 lower to 55p (down 50 per cent from the level of a week ago) before recovering to 63p for a loss of 4 on the day. In after-hours' trading, Asda rose to 65p on the anonymous inter-dealer broker market. Larger institutional inves- tors continued to reduce their holdings yesterday, with some mentioning to salesmen that they were considering aban- doning Asda altogether. But the large lines of stock were absorbed by recovery funds and there was also strong US buying. Turnover reached a record 86m shares. Over the last two days almost 12 per cent of the company's stock has changed hands amid widespread specu- lation that a stake is being built. Metro, the German retailing group, was said to be a possible bidder. There were suggestions that it has taken a 3 per cent stake. Mr Paul Smiddy of Kleinwort Benson said the big UK food retailers are unlikely to be interested in Asda as they have all made rights issues this year. That leaves European retailers, and Metro is one of the few credible com- panies that might bid for Asda. Asda would not comment on the unusually large turnover in its shares nor on the specu- lation about stakebuilding. Hawker hopes Hawker Siddeley shares brushed aside a 14 per cent fall in interim profits. They surged 38 to reach 640p, the highest level for more than a year, as speculation returned that the company was about to become a bid target. Turnover rose to 3.4m, with BTR once again considered a likely predator. There were, however, hints late in the session that the bidder could be a European or Japanese company. Analysts chose to focus on the fall in profits and the gloomy results meeting and responded by cutting full-year profits forecasts. The range is now between Â£115m and Â£125m, down by around Â£20m. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court said: \"The share price is not connected to recovery and fundamentals. Bid speculation is the key.\" A buyer in the options market helped to underpin yesterday's rise. Demand for Glaxo Pharmaceutical leader Glaxo rose strongly on suggestions that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is closer than previously thought to approving Imigran, the com- pany's migraine drug. Mr Paul Woodhouse at Smith New Court said the advisory committee of the FDA would examine the injectable version of the drug in late October. It was approved last month in the UK. \"The FDA is at least six months ahead of the expec- ted date and it is very positive news,\" added Mr Woodhouse. The recommendations of the advisory committee are usually accepted by the FDA. The tab- let version, expected to be a bigger seller, was submitted for approval several months after the injectable. Glaxo ended at the day's best level of 1361p for a gain of 30. RMC gloom Dealers, already steeled for bad results from RMC, the building materials group, recoiled from what was seen by sector specialists as an uncom- fortably bearish outlook for the coming year and marked the shares sharply lower. At the close RMC was 23 weaker at 635p, having been as low as 629p. Turnover came to 1.9m. RMC's interim profits were 36 per cent down at Â£69.9m, in line with market expectations. The shares were hammered by the accompanying trading statement, which said the UK outlook remained bleak with little sign of recovery. Analysts quickly lowered profits estimates for the full year. Mr David Taylor, at Rob- ert Fleming, now expects RMC to achieve Â£165m, but main- tains that RMC is one of the best bets in the sector. BZW downgraded its current-year expectation to Â£155m but said the shares were looking slightly oversold. Vodafone gave another pow- erful performance, closing 112 stronger at 369p on keen turn- over of 4.5m. Activity in Racal Electronics subsided after the intensity of the past two weeks, the shares edging up to 57p. Turnover totalled 3.6m shares, indicating that frantic stakebuilding had abated. County NatWest was thought to have been behind a strong run in the regional elec- tricity stocks. The Electricity Package jumped 22 to Â£2175, while Southern closed 6'/t firmer at 213'/%p. The cautionary tale from RMC reverberated throughout the building materials arena, where Redland, Steetley and Tarmac attracted plenty of sell- ing pressure. Redland, scheduled to report interims on September 26, dipped 8 to 566p, and Steetley, reporting on September 30, was down 14 at 335p, after 333p. Redland is expected to produce around Â£90m profits, compared with Â£108m last time. Steetley is forecast to come up with Â£27m, against Â£49.2m. Tarmac was another to sus- ser. It was additionally bur- dened by hints of a rights issue. The shares fell to 212%p but rallied to close unchanged at 219p. Tarmac's interims are expected on September 24, with Panmure Gordon looking for Â£20m, against Â£97.8m. \"If you thought some of the major con- tractor/housebuilders' results were bad, then prepare for Tar- mac's results,\" said Panmure. BPB lost 13 to 190p amid talk of profits downgrades. House- builder Cala dropped 8 to 68p after a Â£7m interim loss. APV gave up 3 to 126p on reporting a fall in half-time fig- 130C 125C 120C 115C Eq 600 400 200 0 ures 156p full-I tour the Dow FT-A All-Share Index Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Exclding: Intra-market business & Overseas turnover ures. Dowty Group lost 11 to 156p after analysts reduced full-year forecasts following a tour of the City institutions by the company. Cazenove, Dowty's broker, is reported to have led the way with a cut from about Â£45m to Â£35m. Bargain hunters helped Brit- ish Aerospace bounce 16 to 420p on turnover of 2m. BTR, which is seen as a potential bidder for a range of companies, including Pilking- ton, Trafalgar House, Voda- phone and Hawker Siddeley, was relatively calm for a stock which has generated so much interest. It eased a penny to 423p on turnover of 4.7m. Waste management group Shanks & McEwan plummeted 49 to 239p after warning that future profits were under pres- sure. Mr John Dorde of Hoare SGovett cut his forecast for 1991 by Â£5m to Â£34.5m. Smith New Court reduced its estimate by Â£9m to Â£30m. Bathroom maker Spring Ram, one of the best UK share performers recently, climbed 13 to 142p on unusually large turnover of 7.7m after announ- cing a raised dividend and higher interim profits that were above analysts' forecasts. The impact of recent healthy profits combined with opti- mism for an upturn continued to benefit a number of compa- nies. Alumase picked up 9 to 313p following results on Wednesday. Management con- sultancy Alexander Proudfoot, which reported on Tuesday, gained 10 to 425p.JSM-quoted household goods group Jeyes, which also reported on Tues- day, was 13 better at 393p. Fears that Laporte's interim results would disappoint proved groundless. Profits were down by Â£2.2m to Â£50.3m but in line with expectations, and the dividend was increased. The shares advanced 21 to 579p, partly as a result of a technical bounce fol- lowing a fall of nearly 40 points since the start of the month. The prospect of a scrip issue combined with good earnings growth to help Guinness gain 7 to 1005p. Allied Lyons forged ahead 14 to 604p as bid talk once again swirled around the company. The recent clutch of ana- lysts' buy recommendations for advertising agency Gold Greenlees Trott was bolstered yesterday by news that the company was one of four short- listed for the US Beef Council account. Over the last quarter, GGT has won US business worth $20m, but at about $50m the beef account would be the company's biggest US deal yet. Traders added that a recur- rence of vague bid talk helped the shares climb 12 to 215p, making a gain of 61 so far this month. Guardian Royal Exchange was weakened by suggestions that it may have suffered from claims against storms in Can- ada earlier this week. The stock receded 6 to 185p.

   "text_content" : "TURNOVER in London deriv- atives rose yesterday as the FT-SE Index swung in a wide range in nervous dealing, writes Jim McCallum. Derivatives continued to influence the stock market as marketmakers attempted to unwind large share deals hedged in the futures market. During August in the after- math of the failed Soviet coup, arbitrageurs sold futures and bought shares. Now they are attempting to unwind those I positions before the September f Fr-Su contract expires at the b end of the month. i Some derivatives traders estimated that marketmakers v have up to 5,000 contracts to b unwind, which means around v U00m worth of FT-SE stocks c to be sold over the next seven ( trading days. With the arbitrageurs also needing to buy back futures I contracts, the September t FT-SE is being held at an arti- ficially high premium. Septem- ber closed 3 down at 2,600, making a 15-point premium. In the options market, Asda was actively traded iosted by bid speculation. Dealing was focused in near-month calls, with a seller of 1,000 October 60 puts and calls the biggest trade. Hawker Siddeley was helped by active call buying by coun- try brokers.",

   "article_dc_title" : "The New Relationship",
   "text_content" : "IN A QUIET corner of London's Holland Park, British and Japanese horticulturalists have worked to restore a 19th century Japanese garden that has been neglected and left to decay over the years. The garden, reopened this week by the Prince of Wales and the Crown Prince of Japan, symbolises the happier relationship emerging in the twilight of the 20th century \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t JAPAN and Britain, contrary to appearances, have a lot in common; both island nations, great, if not simul- taneous, industrial and mercantile records, passions for golf, even a post- war tendency towards long serving con- servative governments. Yet history and geography for the most part have kept them apart. Even 15 years ago, the relationship was still characterised by indifference and incomprehension. What interest there was in each other was mainly restricted to a handful of academics, artists and diplomats. In realpolitik and security terms, Japan lay in the US sphere of interest. As Japan began to emerge as a global eco- nomic force, Britain's attention, along with that of other western countries, was focused on complaints about Japa- nese restrictive practices. The standard Japanese view of Britain was that it was interesting mainly as a cultural and industrial museum. It is very different today. While it would be an exaggeration to claim that the new partnership between Britain and Japan has become a conspicuous force in the world, a sense of mutual goodwill now pervades most forms of exchange between the two countries. This new warmth has not eliminated all the gulfs between the two, but it has begun bridging at least some of them. The transformation can be directly attributed to the surge of Japanese investment in the UK and the circum- stances behind it. From the modest beginnings of a zip fastener factory in Cheshire in 1972, Japanese manufactur- ers now operate 150 plants in the UK, with a direct employment of about 40,000 and supplier connections amounting to much more. The City of London now boasts well over 50 Japanese banks and brokerage houses. The Japanese expatriate popu- lation in London alone is now variously estimated at between 25-40,000. The changed environment that allowed the Japanese to put their vast savings to use outside their national borders was always going to make Lon- don, the principal European financial centre, a mecca for the Japanese. But the manufacturing presence grew out of a need Japanese manufacturers saw to establish bases inside the European Community. With France and Italy inhospitable and Germany less generous in its investment incentives, Britain, which had its own reasons for wanting to solicit Japanese investment, sought and was able to capitalise on its compara- tive advantages. Japanese industrialists were particu- larly impressed by Mrs Thatcher's suc- cesses against the British trade union movement, which helped allay their concerns about possible labour disrup- tion in the UK. The net result is that today about 28 per cent of Japanese manufacturers which have set up operations in Europe are based in the UK, according to a recent survey by the Japan External Trade Relations Organisation. The \"Japanese effect\" on Britain has not, however, been restricted to the business world. As awareness of Japan has grown in the UK, there has been a growth of interest in the Japanese, their society, and artistic and cultural life. As the British find themselves com- ing increasingly into contact with the Japanese, as customers, employers, business partners and neighbours, the polite indifference that had character- sed their attitude towards Japan is being replaced by a more Involved interest in the country and the people and the role they might play in revital- ising British industry. It is early days yet to assess the effect of all this on the British economy. Japa- nese exports have had only a marginal effect on the UK trade balance. *The Japanese contribution to a Â£3.8bn year-on-year improvement in Britain's current account deficit in the three months to May was just 6 per cent, while the effect on the gross domestic product is less than half of one per cent, according to the Nomura Research Institute. But the presence of the Japanese has had a marked impact on those parts of the UK where the flow of Japanese investment has helped to maintain a higher degree of business confidence in the current recession. There is also some evidence that Jap- anese manufacturers are helping to develop skills and raise quality stan- dards both internally and among their component suppliers. In some cases this has involved sending their own staff to assist suppliers or providing financial assistance. This is not to say that the adjust- ments that have had to be made on both sides have been easy. While seri- ous conflict has been avoided so far, the seeds of friction do exist. On the British side there is concern that the strength of Japanese industrial presence could lead to cultural dominance as well. The fear, at the extreme end of the argument, is that the Japanese will use their economic might to impose their own cultural values on the British. This year's Trade Unions Congress, for example, saw serious divisions over whether to label Japanese demands for a no disruption agreement \"allen\". For their part, British suppliers often feel exasperated when confronted with the never-ending demands made on them by Japanese customers ranging from the quality and delivery time of components to cleanliness in the sac- tory. This is matched by considerable Japanese concern about the high level of absenteeism and employee turnover rate, as well as the difficulty of getting UK workers to extend their normal working hours. After years of hearing about \"the English disease,\" their reaction to the lack of basic skills among UK workers and the low quality standards that are still common in Britain is still one of utter disbelief. Cultural misunderstandings can raise even greater dilmculties in the services businesses. Peat Marwick, the manage- ment consultants group, says that per- sonnel matters rank high on a list of the major concerns of Japanese corpo- rations in the UK. There is a strong concern among Jap- anese diplomats that Japan's conspicu- ous presence in the UK could trigger resentment. The logical counter to this is for Japanese companies to see them- selves first as British, or European, companies, rather than as a branch of their parent company at home, accord- ing to Mr Hideo Matsui, commercial secretary at the Japanese embassy. This does not only mean allowing UK operations greater authority and pro- viding more opportunities for promo- tion to UK staff. There is also a continu- ing need for more technology transfer from Japan and for value-added produc- tion to be moved to the UK. However, there is general satisfaction with the way the British government has lived up to its side of the bargain by asserting the \"Europeanness\" of those Japanese companies producing in the UK. Both sides, after all, have a very practical need for each other. The UK government hoped that Japa- nese investment could reverse a serious fall in manufacturing capacity and help Britain maintain a competitive edge in an integrated Europe. For the Japanese, the move into the UK was based initially on a need to move production closer to the market- place after the yen's sharp appreciation in 1985. Visions of a more dynamic European market emerging after 1992, combined with fears of growing Euro- pean protectionism, further spurred the rush to build production inside the EC. But the continued enthusiasm of the British authorities, and their willing- ness to stand up for the interests of Japanese corporations in the UK, as shown by the British stance on the EC debate over UK-manufactured Nissan cars, has played no small part in bring- ing the lion's share of Japanese invest- ment in Europe to the UK. \"The British authorities have always done what they said they would do,\" says one Japanese businessman in London. The Anglo-Japanese experiment can only have more than temporary bene- fits for both countries if the skills, qual- ity standards and management philoso- phy that helped propel Japan to its present economic status take root in Britain. It will take a good deal of mutual scrutiny and a willingness to adapt and adopt the best for this to succeed. In this process there can no room either for Japanese cultural imperialism or British paranoia. So far, both have been conspicuous by their absence. Michlyo Nakamoto",

   "text_content" : "IT was In F ary 19.2 that the then Mr David Young, a special advlser at the Depart- ment of Industry, returned from a tour around Japanese manufacturing plants. He realls; \"I was astounded by what I saw, particularly the quality of prodicton, with zero defects. That was confir- mation of how, important it was to get Japanese manufac- turing investment into the UK.\" The special adviser went on to become Lord Young of Grafiham, who was Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry when Nis- san decided to double its car assembly capacity in the north east; when Honda secured its relationship with Rover, the former state owned British car maker; and when Toyota announced plans for an assem- bly plant in Derbyshire. Lord Young, now executive chairman of Cable & Wireless, the telecommunications group, reflects : \"It is only now becoming apparent how signifi- cant these investments will be to the balance of payments and the rebuilding of this indus- trial sector. By the middle of the decade we could have the strongest car industry in the EC. A decade ago we had the weakest.\" How much of the wave of Japanese industrial investment in the last decade was due to a deliberate strategy pursued by civil servants and politicians? Mr Eddie Ripley, director of the Japan desk at the Invest in Britain Bureau which pro- October 1988: Britain's first Bluebird IS hatched motes the UK as an investment location, says: \"We do not go out to target particular sectors. The Japa- nese do not like being pushed. It is much more subtle than that. You have to move more at their pace and encourage them in your direction.\" The attraction of inward investment has been due to two different sets of factors. First, in the 1980s the gen- eral environment for Japanese investment in the UK improved markedly. Since the settlement of disputes about access to Japanese markets in the early 1980s, Anglo-Japanese relations have enjoyed a rosy stability. The UK government was the most open within the EC to inward investment. With Mrs ,Thatcher in power Japanese companies were assured a warm welcome they could not rely on getting elsewhere in There were also a number of cultural factors which Japa- nese companies mention - both Britain and Japan are islands with constitutional monarchies - as well as the English language. The UK with relatively low labour costs and tougher trade union legislation in the 1980s was seen as a cost efficient base to launch into the grow- ing European market. It was this combination of economic, political and cul- tural factors which explains much of Britain's attractive- ness to Japanese industrialists. However, development agen- cies, local councils and the government itself have all become much more adept at exploiting this favourable envi- ronment. This is the second set of sac- tors: the growing professional- ism of efforts to attract foreign investment. It has often been at a micro-level at councils and development agencies that detailed strategies have been worked out to attract invest- mOent All the regional develop- ment organlations now have representatives in Tokyo. Many of the most depressed areas to which Japanese investment has been attracted have Labour councils, which have become far more adept at attracting foreign investors. These regional development agencies deal with companies when they get to the point of examining particular locations for investment. It is then that the competition with alterna- tive sites within the UK or elsewhere in Europe is most intense. The companies are often passed on to the regional by the Invest in Britain Bureau, which was set up in 1976 to coordinate activities promoting the UK as an invest- ment location. The Bureau's work has become increasingly profes- sional. Mr Ripy, a long serv- ing foreign offibe official who has worked in Tokyo, is a flu- ent Japanese speaker and much of the bureau's material is published in Japanese. The IBB hosts an annual seminar in Tokyo for execu- tives considering investment in Europe at which Japanese companies with plants in Britain recount their expe* ence and government ministers explain policy. The IBB has also just started running a series of regional seminars in cities such as Osaka and Hiroshima, where local companies which are exporting to Europe are invited to hear about the possible ben- efits of investing in manufac- turing capacity. These seminars are followed up by two staff at the British Embassy in Japan who work full time on inward invest- ment. The IBB then sponsors a series of missions to Britain which allow Japanese execu- tives to visit at least five regions, talk to potential sup- pliers and examine the quality of the infrastructure. These seminars and missions are not just talking shops. They serve a very practical purpose. Even a company as large and sophisticated as Toyota came to the UK, via one of the IBB's seminars. In the last five years the seminar and mission pro- gramme has cost about Â£3.5m and companies which have attended the seminars have created about 11,000 jobs in the UK. Since 1985, 95 Japanese man- ufacturing companies have invested in the UK; 25 of them came on an IBB corporate mis- sion.",

   "text_content" : "THERE is a joke in South Wales that it is better to work for a Japanese company than an English company because at least the Japanese company will not go out of business and disappear. The main question about Japanese investment is whether it will carry on com- ing to Britain in the same quantities as the past decade. What are the main determi- nants of Japanese industrial investment in the UK and how are they likely to change in the next few years? Perhaps the most important factor determining the flow of investment out of Japan is the financial strength of Japanese companies. Although the industrial and commercial sec- tor in Japan is in better shape than the financial and property sectors, the tightening of mon- etary policy since the end of 1989 has significantly worsened financial conditions for the cor- porate sector. The cost of capital seems unlikely to fall to the very low levels of the early 1980s and so it is doubtful that the overall level of foreign direct invest- ment by Japanese companies will grow at the rate it did in the last decade. In addition the strength of the yen in the mid 1980s was a factor driving investment overseas as Japan was losing its competitiveness as a manufacturing base. In the last two years the yen has fallen against the ECU, reduc- ing the competitive disadvan- tage of manufacturing in Japan. Nevertheless, despite a downturn in Japanese foreign direct investment last year, the UK still managed to claim a higher share of it. The UK last year was the destination of as much Japanese investment as the rest of south east Asia. Will the UK maintain its position as the most favoured Japanese location in Europe ? A combination of several sac- tors will determine the answer. * POLITICS. Officials at the British Department of Trade and Industry say that after Mrs Thatcher's resignation there was a flurry of anxious inquiry from Japanese investors. Not only have DTI officials been able to assure investors that Mr Major is just as keen on foreign investment, but they can also point to a much more pragmatic approach on behalf of the Labour Party. Labour spokesman show no desire to follow Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, in her criticism of Japanese companies. They sup- ported the UK government s arguments on behalf of Japa- nese car makers seeking access to the European market. Many Labour local councils in depressed areas are now used to dealing with Japanese inves- tors. * COMPETITION. The UK is facing growing competition within Europe as other coun- tries develop more concerted approaches to attract invest- ment. Officials at the Invest in Britain Bureau which coordi- nates efforts to attract foreign investors to the UK report that both the French and the Dutch Post-Communist Eastern Europe may become the next theatre for Investors governments, as well as those of the German Lande, have become much more profes- sional in their pitches to Japa- nese investors. In Ireland, cor- poration tax has been sharply reduced for foreign investors. Even more significantly, the opening of eastern Europe cre- ates an alternative, potentially low cost base from which Japa- nese manufacturers could launch into western markets. As yet Japanese groups have been cautious about invest- ment in eastern Europe given the remaining political uncer- tainties and the underdevel- oped infrastructure for busi- ness. However, in the long run eastern Europe could attract investment that might other- wise have gone to the UK. * 1992. One of the main forces pulling investment to Europe was the fear that the 1992 single European market programme might lead to the erection of trade barriers which would block exports from Japan. However, with the comple- tion of the single market and the recent signing of an agree- ment on car exports, Japanese companies might become more confident that they will be able to export to Europe from Japan without facing additional trade barriers, say DTI officials. In addition, the pace of eco- nomic integration might affect Japanese calculations about where they should invest within Europe. After a surge of investment in the UK, Japa- nese companies may decide they should invest more in continental Europe to ensure they do not become over dependent on one country. DTI officials say there is no evi- dence as yet of such a switch. * MOMENTUM. Will the build up of Japanese invest- ment in the UK create a momentum of its own, which will bring more investment? There is little sign as yet that Japanese manufacturers are bringing their suppliers with them into the UK. For instance, Japanese steel manu- facturers have invested in the US to supplier car transplants in North America but they have refrained from invest- ment in Europe. Although Nip- pon Dhenso, the leading car components maker, has invested in the UK it is yet to develop a significant presence. However, one sign of a momentum building up behind Japanese investment is the number of companies, such as Matsushita, Nissan, Sony and Hitachi, which have made their second investments in the UK. As a high proportion of the large Japanese groups already have a presence in the UK, much of the effort to attract new investment will switch to smaller companies with inter- national ambitions, according to Mr Eddie Ripley, head of Japanese activities at the Invest in Britain Bureau. There are also signs that Japanese companies are gradu- ally adopting more flexible approaches to how they invest in the UK. In the course of the 1980s almost all investments were in greenfield site assem- bly plants. However, of the last 40 deals, 17 were investments in greenfield sites, 17 were joint-ventures and the remain- der were acquisitions. The Japanese will keep on coming but it will probably be in smaller numbers and through different routes than the past. Charles Leadbeater",

   "text_content" : "AT THR UK motorcycle market's peak, in the late 1970s, more than 800,000 motorcycles, scooters and moapeds found buyers each year. In 1991, according to Mr David Hanmock, saldes manager of Honda UK's motorcycle division, the total will be around 65,000470,000.

So when a 16 or 17 year old says he's going to buy a bike, parents often say they'll buy him a car Instead\". With the European motor- cycle Indutry demoted to the sidelines, competition between the Japanese producers for dwindling unit sales has become Intense. It is easy to understand why, for the decline in powered two- wheeler sales has gone on throughout most of the devel- oped world, to the extent that the Japanese Industry is now producing little more than one third of its 10m-plus volumes of the late 1970s. Honda retains its long-held market leadership of the UK - by a wide margin in the case of m--ed. It claims a 40 per cat sa\"e at current mope maies, expected to total 12,000 this year after 18,215 In 1930, represeting a decline of Yamaha is a distant second, at around 26 per cent, with Suzaki a simi- larly distant third with 10 per cent and Kawasaki fourth with four per cent. The full-scale motorcycle sector is a different matter, with Honda and Yamaha virtu- ally neck and neck with 24 per cent each. Kawasaki has become a much fiercer con- tender, with marginally under 28 Bar cent fizki, once a much closer rival to Honda, is now tralning the market with just over 15 per cent. The sector is faring better than mopeds, with sales currently running some 28 per cent below year-ago levels. In both 1989 and 1990 sales were around 68,000 units. Honda's David Hancock sees little prospect of any sales upturn before early to mid- 1992, stressing that the motor- cycle market, apart from its structural problems, has been hit by recession like everyone else. The only consolation, sug- gests the Motor Cycle Associa- tion of Great Britain's David Dixon, lies in the fact that per- unit value of motorcycle sales uwuriur - S n obvious ahoico has been rising sharply. \"Average spending now is about pounds 3,500. The kind of buyer being drawn into the market now is also prepared to spend Â£500 or so for his leather suit;in fact there is a very strong trend upmarket.\" Driving the trend, he sug- gests, is the \"frustration sac- tor\" attached to travel now, particularly in the heavily congested South-East. With rail and other public transport services now unreliable and in gathering crisis, and car com- muter routes increasingly logdammed, a growing number of executives are returning to the motorcycling they had pre- viously abandoned by their early 20s. Says Dixon: \"we're starting to see the situation whereby people with a company entitle* ment to a fairly expensive car are opting for something smaller and cheaper - and thus more tax effective - and topping up with a motorcycle.\" It is a trend which the Japa- nese suppliers, and their local agents, are following with the closest attention.",

   "text_content" : "THE UK motor industry's prospects are being trans- formed by the wave of inward investment by Japanese car makers. The moves by Nissan, Toyota and Honda all to locate their first European car plants in the UK should guarantee that UK car output in the sec- ond half of the 1990s will exceed 2m cars a year, more than double the level of the first half of the 1980s. The warm welcome given by the UK Government to the Jap- anese motor industry has been harshly criticised by some European car producers. To Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group, the UK is fast becoming a \"Japa- nese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe,\" and \"Japan's fifth largest island\". The UK Government has been unmoved by such attacks, however, and has emerged as a staunch defender of the Japa- nese motor industry's interests in the European Community, not least in the years of wran- gling over the issue of Japa- nese car makers' access to the single European market after 1992. The development of the Jap- anese vehicle makers in the UK is changing the face of the motor industry in Britain. The traditional domestic car producers, Rover (which is The gap between the best and the worst performers Is dramatic and growing now 20 per cent owned by Honda), Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall) of the US, and Peugeot-Talbot, the UK subsidiary of Peugeot of France, are in the front line. They are being forced to con- front at close range Japanese vehicle production, engineer- ing and development methods which are driving motor indus- try reforms worldwide. The disparities in the perfor- mance of the world's leading car makers are enormous. No matter what the yardstick - be it efficiency and productiv- ity in design, development, manufacturing and distribu- tion, or be it the quality and reliability of the finished prod- uct - the gap between the best and worst performers is both dramatic and growing. A provocative study pub- lished last year by the Massa- chusetts Institute of Technol- ogy claimed that the Europeans take more than twice as many hours as the Japanese to assemble a car. It takes the Europeans and the Americans almost double the engineering effort to develop a new car compared with the Japanese, amd the Japanese will be finished in two-thirds of the time. The arrival of Nissan, Toyota and Honda - as well as Isuzu in light commercial vehicles through a joint venture with GM - means that existing vehicle producers In the UK face the sternest competitive test, ana they do not have the advantage of starting on green- field sites with young work- forces. The latest example of how the Japanese car makers are changing existing industry practices in the UK has come in Toyota's negotiations with the unions which are compet- ing for a deal at its Buraston, Derby car plant and the associ- ated engine making nt in Deersd.North Wales. rep= resents one of the most h pr single union deals ssan started production in Sunderland in north-east Eald inUL Toyota has proposed an 0 1 1t which some union leaders regard as a no-atruie dual.

Currently only blue col- lar workers can be laid off without pay in the rest of the British motor industry. It now appears certain that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese car makers will account directly for around a third of UK car production of around 2m units a year helped by total planned investments of more than Â£1.8bn that have already been announced. Under these plans: * Nissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Â£700m Sunderland car and engine plant by 1992/93. Output totalled 76,000 last year and is expected to reach 120,000 this year with more than 80 per cent ear-marked for export. Nissan is also investing in research and development facilities in the UK, and is establishing a wholly-owned vehicle distribution operation to control its dealer network. Production at the Sunder- land plant, the first Japanese car assembly operation in Europe, which began in small volumes in 1966, will receive a further boost next year, when Nissan begins output of a sec- ond car range at the plant and the full capacity of 220,000 cars a year could be reached in 1993. The workforce is rising to 4,000 by the autumn of 1992. * Toyota, which starts pro- duction in late 1992 is commit- ted to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995 rising to 200,000 cars a year by 1997/96 at Burnaston, near Derby, but this time-table could well be brought forward. It is investing Â£840m in car assembly and engine plants. * Honda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Â£350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. The production will be sold under both Honda and Rover badges. Rover is already prod- ucing up to 40,000 Honda Con- certos a year at its Longbridge, Birmingham plant. After more than a decade of increasingly close collabora- tion with Rover, Honda has also taken a 20 per cent equity stake in the vehicle operations of Rover, which is 60 per cent owned by British Aerospace. * Isuzu holds a 40 per cent stake in IBC Vehicles, the Luton-based light commercial vehicles joint venture with General Motors of the US. IBC has recently begun production of a range of four wheel drive leisure utility vehicles. The vehicles, which will be sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera in Europ are based on an Isuzu m sold as the Isuz Amigol/Rodeo in the US and the Isuzu Mu in Japan. Output, which is planned to total 40,000 a year in 191, has followed a E96m investment in the projecL IBC also produces two van ranges the Isuzu-designed VauxhaflWIsuzu/0M3 MI and the Suzukidesigned Vauxhal/ GME Rascal (also sold by Suzuki as the Super Carry).

   "text_content" : "THE AUTOCRATIC nature of traditional British manage- ment, the suspicion that work- men are inherently lazy, the conviction that meetings are a waste of time; these are some of the attitudes which Dr Clive Morton, Komatsu UK's director of personnel and administra- tion, is trying to challenge. Before becoming Komatsu's first employee at its European excavator plant at Birtley, Tyne and Wear, in late 1985 Dr Morton, a civil engineer, had spent 22 years in British indus- try. He worked his way up and became director of resources and administration at both Wimpey Offshore and Wimpey Engineering. But he saw Komatsu as the opportunity for a management style he had been unable to implement before. \"I've always wanted to see a situation where we used people properly, overcame the 'them and us' barriers and recognised the dignity of the individual and work.\" The result is a company which is trying to fuse the best of British and Japanese philos- ophies; a hybrid which expects team working from all its 400 employees - including the managers. Komatsu, set up in the plant which its American competi- tor, Caterpillar, closed down in 1963 with 1,000 job losses, has many of the features - flexible working, a single union agree- ment, insistence on total qual- ity control - common in apa- nese UK plants. But Dr Morton is unusually candid in admit- ting the burden which genuine teamwork, as opposed to sham consultation, has placed on senior managers. \"You have to end up being big enough to recognise that other people have ideas and you must take other people with you.\" And he admits; \"People from this company do suffer because we're trying to learn from the Japanese but we operate in British ways.\" Dr Morton believes the greater independence of mind of the British can give them an edge over their Japanese coun- terparts, but combining indi- vidualism with teamwork can be difficult: British people, for example, tend to see ideas as \"theirs\". And the Japanese, he says, have meetings with no agenda and no firm conclusion, attended by employees appar- ently unrelated to the subjects discussed; the meetings' func- tion is to spread information and develop a drift towards consensus. British Komatsu employees have found this way of working uncomfortable, so broad-based working parties and project teams have been set up to overcome departmen- tal barriers. The Birtley plant's four-man board of directors, which includes Dr Morton, is 50-40 British and Japanese. The Jap anese too, he says, have had to adapt. \"They've had to recogi nise they have to deal wit people issues on a face-to-face basis.\" This is difficult for them, he says; they prefer implicit communication. The British, in contrast, like things spelled out; Indeed, they want the manager to go through the pain of doing so. Working hours are compara- ble with British companies, says Dr Morton, though he himself shoulders an awesome number of additional business community commitments; as well as being deputy chairman of Tyneside TEC and a visiting lecturer at Durham University Business School he is a key member of numerous organisa- tions and tirelessly promotes the causes of Total Quality and commitment to training. Komatsu's workforce are currently on a 38.5 hour week. Morten (left) mnd IUTy: fmlIwo~fdn cam be a burden The company had promised a reduction to 37 hours but, in view of the recession, the employee advisory council agreed it should be shelved for now and reviewed next year. About 10 per cent of shop- floor employees previously worked for Caterpillar in the same plant; they Include 28- year-old Mr David Kilkenny. A plater, he is now a team leader, responsible for 10 men. At Komatsu the men work much more as a team than at Caterpillar, he says, giving them more varied work and a much greater feeling of being part of the company. The shop- floor is more automated and it works more efficiently and harder, he says, but there is a happier atmosphere and the -best management-employee relations he has experien in his 12 years in industry. Even so, he doubts the \"them and us\" perception can be eradicated and questions whether job satisfaction and heavy industry can be bedfel- lows. \"It's hard work, you're looking out for dangers all the time, you have to be on the ball all the time.\" Like many production staff, he is dubious about the daily exercises which Komatsu, alone among Japanese compa. nies in the north-east, runs in the workplace. But he willingly participates in a quality circle, run by one of the men in his team. And he respects the fab- rication manager's knowledge and his regular contact with the 130 men in his section; at Caterpillar Mr Kilkenny never even met his departmental manager. Komatsu, he says approv- ingly, is much more safety con- scious. And he was deeply impressed when the company paid a workmate, who broke a leg playing rugby, in full for the eight months he was off work. It came, then, as a shock to Mr Kilkenny when last month Komatsu announced a cut of 30 Jobs at Birtley due to the reces- sion. \"I probably was being a little light-headed in thinking it couldn't happen to a Japa- nese firm,\" he says. But he is still glad, in a diffi- cult economic climate, to be working for a Japanese com- pany. \"I think Komatsu will work harder to try to save jobs than a British or American firm.\"",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "THE spaceship has landed, said Mrs Edwina Currie, the loquacious IMP for South Der. byshire. She was not talking about an extra-terrestrial being but, at a recent conference of the Anglo-Japanese Institute, of Toyota, the car manufac- turer, setting up next door. \"I look out of my kitchen window and see the sun reflect off a remarkable silver cover- ing, reinforcing in my heart the feeling about Toyota that what we have got here is some- thing very different, very new, very big that has appeared out of the blue and landed in our society,\" she said. There is a degree of poetic licence here. The phenomenon is not new; after all, Sony has been operating in Wales since 1974 and Toyota is but one of three Japanese car assembly plants either operating or planned in the UK. Nor did it appear out of the blue. Derby- shire County Council fought hard to attract it. There are two points about this. First, the regions see Jap- anese investment as a means of stimulating more economic growth and inward investment bureaux compete to obtain it. Second, the minute Toyota \"landed in our society\" it set off what locals rapidly termed the Toyota effect. When, in summer 1990, the East Midlands was beginning to feel the pinch of recession, a survey by Nottingham Busi- ness School and Price Water- house, consultants, reported that \"business performance across the region was fairly uniform with the exception of Derbyshire where profits and sales held up better. This may be due to the impact of the Toyota development on the local economy.\" At the same time business confidence was higher in Derbyshire than in the rest of the region. The significance of the Toyota effect has a wider appli- cation. A continuing stream of inward investment has delayed the impact of recession in some areas. Telford, for example. \"We still have companies establishing themselves here,\" noted Mr Robert Ruslove, chief executive of the Shropshire Chamber of Industry and Com- merce, contrasting the town with Smethwick in inner Bir- mingham, \"where new compa- nies are not so numerous\". Unemployment in Shropshire is slightly under the national average at 7.6 per cent, but in the West Midlands - the Bir- mingham-Black Country con- urbation - it is 3.6 percentage points above the national aver- age at 11.3 per cent. There is a case, then, for arguing that Japanese compa- nies have partially shielded certain regions from the full effects of recession. That case is strengthened by the fact that frequently Japanese invest- ment tends to be in geographi- cal pockets. . In the area surrounding Newcastle, 25 Japanese compa- nies have established operations in recent years, either on greenfield sites like Nissan, through acquisition like Sumitomo Rubber's pur- chase of Dunlop tyre factories, or through joint ventures like \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Ikeda Hoover. In Milton Keynes, there are 37 Japanese companies, with an especially strong representation from electronics manufacturers. In Telford, there are 21 Japanese companies, the biggest recent arrival being Nippondenso. In Wales, there are 43, including Panasonic, Aiwa and Brother. What these locations have in common is availability of land, the presence of a vigorous inward investment bureau and, in the case of the new towns - Milton Keynes, Telford, Wash- ington and Peterlee - the abil- ity to smooth a commercial transition to British soil with subsidies and allowances. Because there was a surge of Japanese investment in the second half of the 1980s, the momentum of economic growth this engendered was still running at the time reces- sion crept over the British economy. But this is not likely to be more than a temporary phenomenon. A survey by the Research Institute of Overseas Investment at the Export-Im- port Bank of Japan indicated that direct overseas invest- ment came to a standstill in 1990-91 and is likely to remain at a low ebb until 1993. It also showed that the UK, hitherto the favoured European Com- munity destination for Japa- nese companies, is likely to be caught up by Germany. The implication of the sur- vey is that if Japanese invest- ment helped to shield some British regions from the reces- sion, it is not likely to propel them out of it. Rather the eco- nomic benefits will be longer term and come from influence and pressure, not cash. The willingness of Japanese companies to spend time and money on training has long been an example to cash- strapped British companies. But the high standards which are the concomitant of this approach are filtering through into local British industry. There seems little doubt too that Japanese companies want to be part of the communities to which they have been trans- planted. Mrs Currie had four suggestions on how they might gain acceptance. First, \"talk, be open, be candid\"; second, \"be honest and honourable\" - if plans are being changed, explain why; third, \"be Japa- nese\"; fourth, \"share the pros- perity\" and \"create share own- ership schemes\".",

   "text_content" : "THE WHITEHORSE Industrial Estate in Runcorn, Cheshire is an unlikely place to launch a mini-revolution within British industry. But it was there in April 1972 that YKK Fasteners, the zip manufacturer, estab- lished its UK plant, with 250 employees. It was the first wholly owned Japanese manufacturing plant in the UK, according to figures compiled by the Invest in Britain Bureau, a division of the Department of Trade and Industry which is responsible for coordinated efforts to attract inward investment. Through the following eight years after YKK established its plant there were a trickle of other investments by Japanese manufacturers. Sony arrived in May 1973, with a plant in Bridgend, South Wales, which employs 2,400, closely followed by Matsushita. In 1976 NSK Bearings, the ball bearings maker was the first Japanese manufacturer to establish a At first, Japanese investors in Western Europe preferred to go to places such as Dusseldorf presence in the north-east, an area now associated with the Nissan car plant. In the eight years to 1980 there were about 17 investment projects by Japanese manufac- turers. It was not until the 1980s that inward investment from Japan really took off. The IBB has a list of more than 145 manufacturing investments made in the 1980s, with more than 30 research and develop- ment centres. Japanese investment has attracted considerable atten- tion and provoked widespread debate initially because of the changes to working practices and plant management Japa- nese companies brought with them. Quality circles, single status canteens and car parks and flexible working practices, were the most tangible and controversial practices the Jap- anese brought with them. Partly as a result of their greater efficiency Japanese companies have also started to bring far reaching changes in the structure of British indus- try. Some traditional British industry sectors such as ball bearings are now largely for- eign dominated, mainly by the Japanese. The British electron- ics industry, outsid defence electronics, has been rebuilt by foreign investment, much of its from the likes of Sony, Matsus- hita, Hitachi and Fujitsu. Europe's car makers are increasingly apprehensive about the competitive threat posed by Japanese car plants in the UK, which are setting new standards of efficiency and quality for the Industry. Does Japanese investment merit the attention it has attracted ? How significant is it compared with inward invest- ment from other countries such as the US and Germany ? How significant is the UK as a destination for investment compared with other econo- mies? Japanese investment in the UK needs to be set within a European context. In the fiscal year 1990-91 Japan Invested $14.3bn in Europe, 25 per cent of all Japanese foreign direct investment worldwide. Japa- nese investment in Europe between 1951 and 1990 reached $59.2bn, about 19 per cent of the total, according to figures published by Japan's Ministry of Finance. Much of the early Japanese investment in Europe went into areas such as Duisseldorf where electronics companies established their sales offices. Considering that in the early years of Japanese investment overseas the UK lagged behind, its overall share of Japanese investment in Europe between 1951 and 1990 is impressive. The Ministry of Finance fig- ures show that the UK's cumu- lative share of investment pro- jects within the European Community is 32 per cent. The UK has also managed to attract the larger investments. Its share of the value of Japa- nese investment in the EC between 1951 and 1990 is 41 per cent. The UK has attracted 2,134 investment projects worth $22.6bn, compared with 1,187 projects in Germany worth $4.7bn and 1,328 in France, worth $4.1bn. As a European base the UK has become as Important to Japanese as to American companies The UK is now as important to Japan as a base in the EC as it is to US companies.

However, despite the surge in Japanese investment in the 1980s, it still does not match the weight of US investment. It is easy to forget that the UK has long been one of the most internationalised and cosmo- politan economies. Foreign companies which have invested in British manufactur- ing already provide 13 per cent of manufacturing employment, 19 per cent of net manufactur- ing output and 21 per cent of capital expenditure. Even in 1990 the IBB reported 120 investment pro- jects by US companies and 63 by German groups, compared with 37 from Japan and 25 from France. The Japanese investors have tended to locate their plants in particular areas. They are not just investing in the UK but specific regions within the UK. As the the map shows YKK's early investment in Runcorn failed to attract other Japanese manufacturers around it, as did Toshiba's in Plymouth. However, there are some other distinct clusters developing: electronics in South Wales; car manufacturing and engineer- ing in the north east around Komatsu and Nissan; elec- tronic component makers in Scotland and office equipment makers such as Ricoh and NEC around Telford in Shropshire and North Wales. The sectors of investment in the UK largely mirror trends within Europe as a whole. Min- istry of Finance figures for 1990 show the main sectors of investment have been electri- cal and electronic machinery, followed by car assembly and other transport machinery and general machinery. But Japanese industry has not invested in the UK across the board. Apart from a few small joint-ventures there are some significant areas of Japa- nese industrial strength, tradi- tional industries such as steel and shipbuilding, where Japa- The big issue now is whether the capital flow has ended or whether it will go on for another 20 years nese groups have held back from investment. Flows of inward investment are one way to measure the competitiveness of a country as a location for industry. Judged on these criteria Britain became much more competitive in the 1980s. Japanese investment has revitalised some areas of Brit- ish industry such as vehicle manufacturing and created a presence in other areas such as consumer electronics where indigenous manufacturers were weak. It has also helped to strengthen some regional econ- omies which have suffered from the decline of traditional industries such as coal, steel and shipbuilding. However there are many industrial sectors and areas of the country which have been relatively untouched by Japa- nese investment. Perhaps the most important question about Japanese investment is still to be answered: Will the surge in investment in the 1980s prove to be short- lived as Japanese companies spread their activities else- where; or will it provide the basis for a lasting and deeper relationship, an international industrial alliance which could still be changing the shape of industry in Britain in 20 years time?",

   "text_content" : "THOUGH it may not yet have had the sort of impact on Britain's external trading prowess which some observers havesuggested, the Japanese presence in the UK appears poised to become an increas- ingly important factor in the country's economic perfor- mance. The recent narrowing in Britain's trade deficit has given rise to renewed specula- tion that the large, inward wave of investment into the UK on the part of Japanese business is slowly helping to tip the trading balance back into the black. But according to Mr Chris Dillow at the Nomura Research Institute:\"The belief that Japa- nese investment is already having an appreciable effect in narrowing the trade deficit is mistaken. However, this does not mean that it will not have a large impact on the trade bal- ance in the coming years. But it will be seen over five or 10 years, not in the immediate future\". Mr Dillow's remarks support the theory that the most recent Recent trends owe more to cyclical factors than to Japan's Impact on output balance of trade picture has been more influenced by the usual cyclical factors than by any structural changes involv- ing the Japanese contribution to UK output. There are those who, in any case, believe that direct invest- ment into the UK by foreign countries may have no identifi- able or lasting effect on the host country's bilateral trade balance. The argument is that, in the long run, a country's external balance is not determined by investment or trade restric- tions in particular sectors but by macro-economic factors such as a country's propensity to consume more than it saves. Perhaps the truth lies some- where in the middle, so that while the contribution of the Japanese to overcoming any indigenous weakness in Britain's trading performance should not be dismissed, nei- ther must it be exaggerated. For example, the well-publi- cised increase in Japanese car production in the UK accounted for less than one- fifth of the Â£800m improvement in the trade deficit in UK vehicles during 1990 and less than one-twentieth of the upturn in the overall trade bal- ance. According to Nomura, however, there is no question that Japanese investment in the UK will continue to rise, that the resulting activity will displace imports from Japan, that UK exports will also rise and that the trade deficit will, consequently, improve. But there has been some scaling down of earlier, opti- mistic forecasts about the likely extent of Japanese inward investment, not least because of the relative fall in the value of the yen, which has reduced the competitive disad- vantage of producing in Japan instead of at overseas bases. Recent developments in Japan have also conspired to reduce growth in foreign investment, particularly the tightening of Japanese mone- tary policy which has affected the health of the domestic cor- porate sector. Even so, there are some counter-balancing arguments which suggest that the UK will continue to attract a sizeable proportion of any new investment made to improve Japanese penetration in European markets. Nomura, nevertheless, has now trimmed back its forecast of the level of annual Japanese investment into the UK. Whereas two years ago it suggested that total invest- ment could average as much as Â£6.5bn annually for the next 20 years, it now acknowledges that the figure might have been overly-optimistic. So what sort of impact will the Japanese have on Britain's trading performance? Nomura, one of the few research budies which has investigated the issue, calculates that the gross output, at current prices, of Japanese companies In the UK could top Â£20bn next year. The export share of this fig- ure is likely to be very high because UK industry is effec- tively immune to the challenge of Japanese investment This is not because of any inherent efficiency in Britain's own manufacturing activities but because the inward investment is targetted at industries in which the UK has a limited presence, such as consumer electrical goods. Conversely, the import con- tent of Japanese production based in the UK is unlikely to be much more than half The result, Nomura believes, is that by 1995 Japanese invest- ment within the UK could add up to Â£4bn to the country's trade balance. The current account impact would, how- ever, be smaller, to the extent that the profits of this invest- ment would be repatriated. At the same time, around 3 per cent could be added to the country's gross domestic prod- uct. Nomura suggests that, as a result, an additional 600,000 jobs could be created, only one- third of which would be directly employed by Japanese companies. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the cost structures of Japanese compa- nies in the UK reflect a con- tinuing preponderance of so-called \"screwdriver plants\", primarily devoted to assembly. Their presence has been a con- tinuing source of criticism, along the lines that such activ- ities are inferior to other forms of manufacturing activity. The Japanese have specifi- cally been accused of sustain- ing low rates of pay - in 1987 the average pay of manual workers in Japanese-owned manufacturing plants was 10 per cent down on the national average. The alternative argu- ment is that jobs at lower than average pay rates are better than none. Detractors also complain that the incursion of Japanese assembly activity offers no transfer of technological skills and can destroy UK know-how by driving indigenous compa- nies out of business. The criti- cism again overlooks the fact that investment is directed into areas where the British Britain would be foolish to think it can rely solely on Japanese help are not well represented. Despite the reservations and criticisms, it seems likely that while future UK exports will grow roughly in line with world trade, imports will expand faster than domestic demand. The end result is, therefore, expected to be a wid- ening of the trade deficit. Nomura believes that, in the years ahead, Japanese direct investment will have an impor- tant role in narrowing the trade gap, although Britain would be foolish to imagine that it can rely solely on Japan to eliminate the current account deficit or finance it According to Mr Dillow: \"This is not to deny that direct investment is a benefit, merely a reminder that a benefit is not a panacea. Unless UK industry learIns from the Japanese and improves its competitiveness, the trade balance will remain a major constraint on growth.\" Michael Cam n -",

   "text_content" : "Imu MIEEuU. -WW LIVE turbot is menacing on a plate. Nashing and flapping, its teeth are razor sharp and its tail can scatter your chopsticks with a single swipe. But just as the fish seems ready to escape, a Japanese waiter carries it off to the kitchen. After a severe blow to the head, the stunned turbot is returned to your table. Its tail usually flaps for a few minutes but that should not interfere with the stomach, your starter, which is splayed open and cut into bite-sized slices. This dish - sashimi - is all the rage in Japan. But caterers in London say the ordeal is too much for western customers and few restaurants serve it in its freshest form - straight from the fish tank. There are no fish flapping around the largest Japanese kitchen in Europe. Strict hygiene laws mean International Catering (ICL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan Airlines, cannot serve raw fish or sashimi to its customers. Sited in a former engineering plant on the fringes of Heathrow Airport, ICL relies instead on ingredlents flown in regularly from Tokyo and can boast no less than 18 menus for pasenr requiring a specialisedl diet. Tecolmpay emplos nine Jpes hbwho prepare up to 2500 meals a week for aircraft flying to the Orient But unlike restaurants, it has a captive market - ICL customers tend to be strapped into their seats. You cannot stonm out of a Jumbo jet if you dislike the food. Mr Stephen Smith, the company's general manager, claims there are no concessions on quality. \"We produce Japanese food which is traditional,\" he says, \"and we have head-hunted the top chef from Suntory, one of the best restaurants in London.\" Not all airline passengers want to be sustained by a menu of fish and noodles. So ICL offers its carriers - including Virgin - western alternatives. There is no such choice at restaurants on the ground. Steak and chips is not an option at any of London's 70 Japanese restaurants, which may be one reason why ICL is expanding rapidly while chefs in the City have seen orders drop by an average of 30 per cent in the past year. There is a recession in business lunches - the mainstay of the Japanese restaurant trade - and many caterers are feeling the pinch. Mr Takashi Obsumi, manager of the Yumi restaurant in London's West End, says fewer businessmen are eating Japanese. \"This year has been dicult because of the Gulf War and banking scandals in Japan. If anything goes wrong inJapanese company, the entertafluman expenditureit is cut first. Ithas hit our business.\" Mr Ohsumi says the turnover at London's Japanese restaurants, which he estimates at Â£2Sm a year, is likely to decline in 1991. His pessimism is shared by Mr FumIoM yama, owner and chef of two restaurants. Speaking in the kitchen of City kyma, bhis outlet cose to St Paul's Cathedral Mr MNiyama says: \"Businesmen are not spending as they used to. We hope it wil get better next year.\" The trade's reliance on Japanese business customers is one of its main weaknesses, according to Mr Tom Jaine, editor of the Consumers Association's Good Food Guide. \"Where Japanese investment goes, so the restaurants follow,\" says Mr Jaine. You can, for example, find Japanese delicacies at several places in the City. Fumi, a caf6 in Gateshead, meets demand in north-east England from companies such as Nissan and Komatsu. And Japanese cuisine will be on offer soon in Derby, close to the new Toyota plant at Burnaston. Mr Jaine, however, thinks Japanese restaurants outside London may not survive the recession. \"Things like raw fish don't go down well outside the City,\" he says. An expensive reputation is another handicap which deters passing trade. And some critics say the cooking is dreary. \"The food is not very highly flavoured,\" says Mr Jaine. \"It's a much blander cuisine than Chinese. The menus are also impossible and irritating, and it does not lend itself to home cooking.\" Many dishes appear more exotic on paper than on your plate. Iwashino tsumire jiru, for example, sounds like something to sustain a Sumo wrestler. In reality it consists of clear soup with sardine balls. The bean curd used to enliven soup has the consistency of putty. Some recipes are so plain that chest rely on tear-erking sauces to spice them up.Frsh sea urchin or salmon roe, for example, is sometimes disguised with a abocking horserdish psecalled wa w hmakes you cry if you're not expecting it.

   "text_content" : "THE European Commission's statement on Japanese .car imports - issued at the end of July after months of wrangling in Brussels. Tokyo and withi the BC - had all the hall- marks of a sensitive issue, carefully fudged. Its details were vague and its deadlines long (a fully open market for Japanese cars from the year 2000). But even within this flexible framework the two sides baulked at any reference to the most delicate aspect of the whole deal - and the one on which the UK government had lobbied Brussels most heavily - whether so-called \"transplants\" (cars bearing a Japanese marque but produced in the EC) should be included in self-regulated restrictions on production up to the end of the century. As it happens, the Commis- sion believes that an unofficial \"assumption\" that output of such vehicles will rise to 1.2m by the end of the century will easily allow enough room for Japanese manufacturers to expand in the EC without upsetting the most sensitive EC car-makers in France and Italy. But those manufacturers - and, to an extent, their gov- ernments - are still not con- vinced, as Sir Leon Brittan, the British competition commis- sioner put it in July, that \"cars produced in Europe, by Euro- pean workers, are European\". The sheer volume of noise generated by EC manufactur- ers about transplants is proof that Community member states' suspicions about the nature of Japanese direct investment in the EC are still alive. Inevitably those suspi- cions tend to centre on the UK which accounts for onethlid of such investment, including the large bulk of EC-based Japa- nese car production. Mr James Moorhouse, a Brit- ish Conservative MEP, is pre- paring a report for the Euro- pean Parliament on trade and economic relations between the EC and Japan. \"A number of MEPs have said to me over the years, rather ruefully, that we [the UK] have done rather well in investment over the years,\" he says. But anxiety in some member states is not merely a symptom of irritation at Britain's large slice of Japa- nese direct investment. According to a draft of Mr Moorhouse's report, Japanese investment in the EC totalled $42bn in 1989, of which nearly 80 per cent was in the non- manufacturing sector. By con- trast, EC investment in Japan was a mere $2.4bn. \"There's intense concern about Japa- nese activity within the Com- munity and about our inability to get into the Japanese mar- ket in a meaningful way,\" says Mr Moorhouse. That concern has a number of manifestations. On the posi- tive side, it includes tough speeches by EC commissioners in Tokyo and elsewhere urging the Japanese to open their Nbusan's Tynedde plant elan Urn Condneui markets. But commercial oppo- nents of Japanese direct invest- ment are also inclined to criti- cise Britain for providing a platform for Japanese attacks on the European market, and, on occasion, to take revenge on Japanese-controlled businesses based in the EC. For example, when 80 per cent of the UK group ICL was bought by Fujitsu of Japan ear- lier this year its partners in the large European semi-conductor research programme, Jessi, decided to expel the computer manufacturer from three of the five projects in which it was participating. The European Commission - despite being one partner in the umbrella research pro- gramme which covers Jessi - has little or no sanction against such action, but it has always been conscious of the delicate balance between wel- coming non-EC investment in the Community and protecting EC industry. In particular, the Commis- sion is still sensitive to attempts by Japan and others to establish so-called. \"screw- driver\" plants in the EC to assemble predominantly Japa- nese products, which can then be dumped on to the Commu- nity market. Brussels' most fearsome weapon n an arsenal of anti- dumping artillery was removed last year, or at any rate disa- bled. In March 1960, following a complaint from Japan, the Gatt panel outlawed EC rules which allowed dumping duties to be imposed on EC-assembled products which did not have a certain proportion of locally- made components. Brussels has not amended the rules, but neither has it activated them since the Gatt decision. But observers of EC trade policy, including Japanese offi- cials in Brussels, do not believe that it has become easier to invest in the EC as a result of last year's ruling, and the debate over screwdriver plants is still bubbling under the sur- face. Mr Walter Oberreit, who has worked in Brussels for law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton for many years, says: \"They're certainly not going to give up easily on assembly operations that they feel are not substantial enough.\" But he also argues that many \"mere assembly operations\" can be substantial businesses. \"I've seen quite a few, including plants in the UK, where there is a real question of whether they would pass most of the screwdriver rules, but where there are also hun- dreds of employees performing real functions.\" Mr Oberreit points out that, in general, anti-dumping Policy - duties on underpriced imports - tends to enoag rathier thandscuaedrt investment in the Community by non-EC companies. Commis- sion officials maintain that the Sreal reason for duties is to pre- vent \"inlury\" to EC producers, Snot to provide an incentive for investment, and certainly not Sto disable Japanese manufac- Sturers. SCriticised on those grounds, one of the Commission's senior anti-dumping officials tends to produce a dog-eared copy of the Financial Times from April 1968, which contained a memo- rable series of six full-page advertisements by Epson, the Japanese manufacturer of com- puter printers which earlier that year had announced its first UK factory. The picture showed a Japa- nese geisha gradually meta- morphosing into Margaret Thatcher; the text was a stri- dent warning about Commis- sion plans to impose a dump- ing duty on Japanese dot matrix printers. If imple- mented, the adverts claimed, such duties would lead among other things to an increase in unemployment and a reduction in investment in the UK. Duties were duly imposed on printers made by 15 Japanese companies - it was one of the biggest anti-dumping actions then undertaken by the Com- mission -- but, the dumping official claims triumphantly, Epson's dire warnings were never fulfilled.",

   "text_content" : "THOUGH some of the steam may have temporarily gone out of Japan's enthusiasm for acquiring overseas commercial interests, the UK remains eas- ily the most favoured Euro- pean location in which the Jap- anese invest. Despite the first fall for eight years in total, direct invest- ment overseas - brought about by a slowdown in Japan's economic growth and a rise in interest rates - the roll- call of British businesses attracting Japanese investors has continued to lengthen. With one eye on the comple- tion of the single market at the end of 1992 and the additional lure of expanding markets in eastern Europe, the Japanese have remained busy in the UK. Inevitably, the acquisition of household names in the UK has attracted most attention. Interest has been further heightened when the busi- nesses involved have been tra- ditionally regarded as pecu- liarly British - such as Aquascutum or Daks-Simpson. Now, Japanese-owned golf courses are sprouting around the country, a symbol of the They showed more confidence than UK buyers broadening interest which the Japanese investment commu- nity is taking in the UK. In a desperately depressed property investment market, it has been the Japanese who have shown some of the lon- ger-term confidence which has deserted British investors. Nip- pon Life, for example, has just purchased a half-share in Wim- pey's Little Britain office devel- opment in London for Â£110m. A string of multi-million pound property acquisitions have involved Japanese buyers. Total investment outside Japan by Japanese interests - involving manufacturing, ser- vice and financial companies but excluding securities and property - fell by more than 15 per cent in the year to March 199L But investment in the UK is estimated to have risen by 30 per cent during the same period to reach nearly $7bn, equal to 12 per cent of Japa- nese overseas investment - roughly the same as Japan's foreign investment in Asia. Investment in North America reached bnm, about half of all overseas spendg. Estimates wgp that there are nearly 1s Japase compa- nies new operating in Britain, considerably more than In France or Germany.

A check-list of deals since the start of 1989 compiled by the Nomura Research Institute undermines the theory that nearly all investment has been directed into so-called \"screwdriver\" assembly plants. In that period, Nomura has identified 15 stakes or acquisi- tions in British companies, 11 new joint ventures, six research and development pro- jects, 15 cases of further expan- sion and 28 greenfield site pro- jects. Recent investments have included the decision by Toyota to construct a Â£700m car assembly plant at Derby, which will be one of Britain's biggest industrial complexes, a Â£500m commitment by Nissan and a Â£350m programme for Honda. The information technology sector has been a prime target for expansion in the UK and Europe, witness the Â£743m acquisition by Fujitsu, the computer company, of a major- ity stake in ICL, the British mainframe manufacturer. Fujitsu has subsequently announced that it is to link up with British Telecom to take over Fulcrum Communica- tions, BT's last remaining man- ufacturing facility. The deal has provided an all-important point of entry for Fujitsu's telecommunications operations in both the UK and continental European operations. The Japanese have recently also shown themselves, some- what controversially, to be interested in taking stakes in some of Britain's utilities. The speed with which Japanese investors snapped up sizeable stakes - since cut back - in both National Power and PowerGen, the two privatised electricity generators in England and Wales, raised eye- brows in the City. Given the stability of the companies, with guaranteed demand and proven manage- ment and yields considerably higher than on comparable investments in Japan, the interest is not surprising and can be expected to repeated if similar opportunities arise elsewhere In Europe. Other deals involving Japa- nese finance may have been less spectacular but no less interestlng.

One benefit of the Notting- ham centre - which will con- centrate on research and devel- opment work for the aerospace, industrial, automotive, machine tool and general engi- neering sectors - will be the regular exchange of engineers between the UK and Japan. Even further down the scale, the Japanese seem perfectly prepared to make compara- tively small acquisitions in the manufacturing sector. In June, Nansin, a Tokyo-based private company, acquired Flexello Castors, the Slough-based man- ufacturers of castors, wheels and assemblies. The Â£4.3m deal added to the list of businesses facing difficult market condi- tions and securing fresh capi- tal through new Japanese own- ers. Last month, Matchmaker Machines, the Surrey-based manufacturer of computer numerically controlled machine tools, was taken over by Yamazen Corporation. The move is intended to give Yama- zen a strong engineering and The Government has been on the wrong side of the argument technical base in the UK. The Japanese are very reluc- tant to acquire control of com- panies through the share mar- ket and many appear to be concentrating on establishing their own production and sales networks, preferably in the form of joint ventures. If they do take control via the acquisi- tion of shares it is almost always with the consent of the company concerned. A high-profile or any form of controversy is unwelcome - the Japanese remain highly sensitive to the hostile greeting some of their activities pro- voked in the US. Hence, the August decision by Hamamatsu Photonics not to proceed with negotiations to acquire Thorn EMl's light-sens- ing business, following a deci- sion to refer the proposed deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

   "text_content" : "An idea that A decidedly different atmosphere permeates Nissan's 733-acre assembly plant in Sunderland, England. Opened in 1986, the six-building complex boasts the very latest in automotive technology, as you would expect from the world's fourth largest automotive manufacturer. In the press shop, six huge stamping machine mould sheet steel with up to 3,200 tons of force to produce body parts. In the highly automated body assembly plant next door, 86 computerized robots weld parts together as car shells glide by. ,064 And as proof, the Nissan Primera has won numerous prestigious awards for automotive engineering excellence since its launch in 1990. From all over Europe. Truly, the Primera is exceeding all of our expectations. In fact, the Sunderland plant produces 120,000 Primeras yearly. Nearly 90% are exported to various European markets (with the exception of the 3,000 5-door hatchbacks we export to Japan). A figure which translates into a Â£500 million contribution to the U.K. balance of trade. philosophers But it's not high-tech machinery nor state-of-the-art equipment that makes this immaculate plant unique. It's the people. All 3,064 of them. They are British. They are highly motivated and, unquestionably, highly skilled - training at Nissan is second to none in the industry. The product they build - the Nissan Primera - was bom and bred to appeal to European tastes. And the philosophy of \"kaizen\" they adhere to is a rare hybrid of Japanese and, you guessed it, European. Kaizen means continuous improvement in quality. It is a brought In 1992, Nissan will produce a new small car for Europe at the same plant. Annual volume is expected to be around 100,000 units. This will mean a further increase of at least 1,000 jobs at the plant. By then, Nissan's total financial commitment will exceed Â£900 million - the largest Japanese investment in the U.K. While these numbers may look impressive, there is something much more important involved here. Nissan is firmly committed not only to the U.K. economy, but also to its people: Our customers.

   "text_content" : "HIDEAKI HIRANO, senior advisor to Is Oiibon, manag- ing director of Nissan's Suntiland ncar plant, relaxes, still d I his ompany issue blue overalls, at the end of a working day and recounts his surprise at the similarity he has found in the way Nissan's plants in Japan and Sunder- land do Before arriving in Wearside three years ago Mr Hirano, his experience of the West then confined to the US, expected the Sunderland con- duct towards each ti to be rather more pushy. He was astonished to dis- cover a workplace where West- ern managers listened to each other and, even in hot debate, avoided humiliating public attacks on individuals. \"They have the ear to hear\", he says appreciatively. \"Is that a typical British style?\" About 10 miles down the A19, from the perspective of North East England's first Jap- anese factory, the NSK Bear- ings Europe plant at Peterlee, Nissan's Sunderland operation looks different again. \"In rela- tion to Nissan I suppose we're slightly more Japanese,\" says personnel manager Mr Bill Wiles. \"They've gone about things in a much more aggres- sive way.\" The companies' promotional stance is indeed poles apart; NSK is as rarely in the news as Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK is out of it. Behind the scenes, though, NSK's recom- mendation was a key factor in the decision by Nissan, and other Japanese companies, to locate in the North East. Both share the hallmarks - ingle union agreements, flexi- ble working practices and egal- itarian uniforms and canteens - of the Japanese incomers. And both are part of an influx which has had a profound impact on attitudes, in what had been a traditionally minded region, towards inward investment, trades unionism, management and working practices. Contact between North East England and Japan is not a recent phenomenon; from 1862, the Japanese visited the region in admiration of its mining and heavy industry, becoming val- ued customers of Lord Arm- strong's Tyneside-based arma- ments. and shipbuilding empire. Between 1885 and 1905 most of the Japanese fleet was built or armed by his Newcastle works; Geordies helped the Japanese win the 1904-05 Rus- so-Japanese War and they warmly cheered 150 of \"Togo's heroes\" when they came to watch Newcastle play at St James' Park in 1906. At that time the Armstrong empire was even exporting Newcastle- built cars to Japan and helping the Japanese create their own \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t steel works. In later years, however, the relationship cooled and when NSK set up in Peterlee in 1976 it adopted a low profile, partly out of fear of backlash from World War Two. Its arrival also sparked bitter criticism from the UK bearings industry, then fighting for sur- vival; NSK's purchase last year of United Precision Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer of bearings, was not without irony. But by 1981 when Nissan started hunting for a UK site, the calamitous decline of North East heavy industry and spiralling unemployment had brought a change of heart; job hunting agencies, Labour-con- trolled local authorities and trades unions teamed up to win the project and mutterings from dissident unionists were condemned as betrayal. Nissan's choice in 1984 of Sunderland for its European car plant was a big psychologi- cal boost for the region. \"It was a bit like winning the Cup,\" says Ed Robson, then the local authorities' Nissan project coordinator and now Sunder- land's director of architecture and planning. The Nissan project, hailed then as Europe's largest single- site investment by a Japanese manufacturer, was rightly seen as the key to more investment; North East England now has Europe's largest concentration of Japanese manufacturing industry. Nissan's Â£700m Sunderland piant, on target to employ 4,000 people by 1998, and Fujitsu's new semi-conductor plant In Newton Aydcliffe, Co Durham, aiming for 11,600 employees by 1M, together 0onst0tute more than Â£ibnctlofnvestment. North Est England now has 42 Japa- nese companies, expected by 199 \"to employ more than UM people. In 195-1990 the Japanee were by far the big- gest creators of new jobs among countries bringing Investment to the region. Dr John Bridge, the North- ern Development Company's chief executive, says Nissan elped break, down antipathy to iward investment by forg- ing enduring links with local financial sector and profes- sional firms. \"From that point the local business community saw there was business there.\" It has also brought work to established local manufactur- ing companies, as well as spur- ring 19 new automotive suppli- ers to set up in the region. This year, Nissan will spend Â£133m, almost half its total UK expen- diture on components and materials, with North East based suppliers. In the last 18 months, fewer new Japanese projects have arrived, but a number in the region have expanded. NSK for example, now employing 800 people in a Â£100m investment, last September opened a new Peterlee plant making ball bearings, a joint venture with AKS, and a steering compo- nents plant. The job creation agencies insist the Japanese, selling UK- - made products throughout Europe, are bringing lasting diversification to the North East's industrial base. They are, Dr Bridge argues, inher- ently different from the US branch plants which pulled out in the 1960s and 1970s. As long as the Japanese are maintaining, indeed increasing employment - Nissan this month launched a 1,000 job recruitment campaign, double the previously announced number - most North Eastern- ers are glad of their presence, especially as they provide many manual jobs for men. But any substantial cutbacks in the future could well rea- waken earlier criticism that inward investment fosters a branch plant economy. There is no doubting, though, the major influence of a handful of the Japanese com- panies, notably Nissan and Komatsu, in promoting to local UK owned businesses the importance of quality in manu- facturing processes and end product. While NSK makes no bones about being Japanese, NMUK promotes itself as a British company with a predominantly British management. But it still needs somebody like Hideaki Hirano, who describes himself as a \"transmitter\", to bridge the gap. Chris Tighe",

In London alone there is Visions 'of Japan at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the largest exhibition held there for many years and an evocation of Japan past, present, and future; at the Science Museum Robotics Japan introduces the latest developments in indus- trial robots; at the British Museum there is a display of the monumental wooden sculp- ture of the Kamakura period (1185-1333); and at the Barbican a celebration of post-1945 Japa- nese photographs. To come is the art of the printmaker Hokusai at the Royal Academy and 20th cen- tury Japanese painting also at the British Musuem, plus a top level Sumo wrestling tourna- ment at the Albert Hall in October and, this week end in Hyde Park, a great open air family festival presenting archers on horseback, drum- mers, fireworks, and huge papin-ach' models. b6 Mo is repiCated throughout the country. ft is all part of the Japan Festival, a boneana which continues until January.

All these have won awards under the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme whereby the Government encourages new sponsorships by doubling the aid on a pound to pound basis. It is noticeable that Japanese companies like to support the arts at the local level, near their field of operations. Local sponsorship can also help to make the workplace enjoyable Hitachi, for example, has a sac- tory at Aberdare in South Wales and Nissan a base near Chichester. Since moving its factory close to Manchester some five years ago Brother has generously supported the local Hall6 Orchestra, as well as Manchester City Football Club. Sponsorship is in line with the Japanese good neigh- bours approach, making the work place an instrumental part of iving and not some- where distasteNM to go just to earn money. While Other companies have puld tin their hob s, and are reluctant to invest money in the arts during a recesion, the Japanese companies have mal-taaed their co-uime, and have become the leading force In arts sposorhip in the UK. In the pat year Dimawa has backoed the new production of Cornmm at Covent Garden; ers concemts by the tenor Jose Caeras with the IRo; and fitachi the Welsh NaUiosald Opera.

Toyota is making the biggest e cash contribution, but others, e who have not previously comn- r mitted themselves to the arts, i. are enthusiastically co-operat- ing. Sanwa, for example, is spending more than Â£200,000, with some of the money com- ing from its head office in Tokyo; some from its London Soperation - to sponsor the - Mingei exhibition of folkcrafts h such as textiles, ceramics, and r lacquer work. a For many it is a new experi- r ence: in Japan there is no tra- r dition of companies being so e. closely involved in financing i culture. Yet in some of the 11 major exhibitions, like the e ioes fJapn at the V & A, hundreds of Japanese compa- nies are combining to meet a bill which far exceeds Elm. This exhibition has involved large scale structural alter- ations at the museum and, under the direction of the architect Arata Isozaki, three rooms have been elaborately transformed to reveal, in one, a full size temple and tea house, in another the sights and sounds of a contemporary Jap- anese city, and in the third a vision of the electronic future. There are some in Japan who think that the Festival portrays too conservative a view of Japan, too much hark- ing back to past culture. But, with its jazz and rock, its con- temporary dance and video art, the Festival is far more than a re-assertion of Noh plays and Kabuki. Ranging throughout the UK, from the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra playing in Belfast; to dual performances in Japanese and Gaelic of traditional folk music in Dingwall in the Ork- neys; to horse back archery at Cardiff Castle, it will do its utmost to achieve its aim of removing misunderstandings about Japan and its culture.",

   "text_content" : "UK personnel manager considbring widespread changes in working practices or employee relations and the chances are that he or she will have looked eastwards to Japan for a little inspiration. Japanese working methods, with their emphasis on quality, team working and flexibility, are admired by managers the world over. The ways Japanese companies relate to their employees, through sophisti- cated communication systems and repiesentative bodies, are increasingly emulated. The pivotal concept in Japa- nese production methods is \"total quality control\", which espouses the theory that qual- ity should be built into prod- ucts at the production stage - obviating the need for quality inspectors - and is the respon- sibility of all workers. It is supported in varying degrees by just-in-time (JIT) production, quality circles, team-based organisation of pro- duction and flexible labour deployment. Inter-worker dis- putes over demarcation are dis- couraged through a relatively simple industrial relations sys- tem; unlike traditional UK manufacturing companies, which often deal with a pleth- ora of unions, Japanese employers usually deal with one representative body, some- times an in-house company union, sometimes a group of workers elected directly by their colleagues. The idea behind the Japa- nese manufacturing model is that making products as quickly as possible and with perfect quality is impossible without competence, commit- ment and adaptability on the part of the workforce. These are encouraged by single sta- tus working conditions, in which all employees are treated as one. In the UK, the combinations vary from company to com- pany and from plant to plant. A survey of Japanese compa- nies in Britain by Nick Oliver and Barry Wilkinson*, pub- lished in 1989, found that 64 per cent used JIT, 73 per cent quality circles, 75 per cent \"staff\" benefits at all levels, 83 per cent in-company communi- cations, 93 per cent group working, and 95 per cent flexi- ble working. The constant, used by all companies surveyed, was total quality control. In a parallel survey of large UK companies, the authors found similar principles widely in use. Quality circles were in place in 68 per cent of compa- nies; all-level staff benefits at 74 per cent; and in-company communications at 89 per cent. In virtually all cases, the use of techniques associated with Japan - although not neces- sarily developed exclusively there - had grown signifi- cantly in recent years. For example, of 45 compa- nies employing TQC, 23 had introduced it between 1963 and 1987. Even so only about 60 per cent of all companies had implemented TQC policies, against JA'as 100 per cent. The- prolem with assessing the impact of Japanese invest- ment In the UK on British per- sonnel and human resources practices is that techniques often associated with Japan have been pioneered with just as much vigour in other coun- tries, for example among the so-called excellent US compa- nies. What can be said is that there is an extraordinary hun- ger on the part of UK manag- ers for knowledge about Japa- nese methods. Many of the Japanese companies that have set up in the UK are keen to help companies wishing to learn from their production and human resource manage- Some of the changes originated in the US rather than In Japan ment techniques. Yamazaki, the machine tool manufacturer, has had more than 11,000 visitors to its Worcester plant since it opened four years ago. Mr Ian Gibson, chief executive of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, says all of the company's competi- tors, Marks and Spencer and many local businesses have been to \"look and learn\" at the company's north-east plant. \"Clearly we do not tell peo- ple anything about the busi- ness which is confidential but, by and large, the doors are open. Businesses have been able to use things - not every- thing - they have seen, adapt them and put them into their own business in order to improve them.\" Mr Bruce Warman, person- nel director at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, is one of those who have not yet been inside Nis- san's UK plant, although he hopes to visit it soon. Like other personnel direc- tors in the motor industry, Mr Warman has in recent years negotiated widespread changes to working practices. At Vaux- .hall's- Ellesmere Port plant employees last year agreed to a package of changes including the introduction of single table bargaining, in which all unions speak \"with one voice\"; elimi- nation of spheres of influence whereby a union has sole membership rights in particu- lar areas of a plant; team work- ing; and a reduction in the number of employee classifica- tions from 30 to eight. If that all sounds thoroughly Japanese, Mr Warman cautions against such a view. Some of the changes, including single table bargaining, were at least as strongly influenced by prac- tice in Vauxhall's US parent company as Japan, he says. What is undeniable, he says, is that the Japanese success has helped stimulate a long, hard look at existing practice, and that has been accentuated by the existence of a Nissan plant in the UK: \"Japanese practice is not everything but it has been influential.\" A similar line is taken by Mr Mike Temple, personnel adviser at Northumbrian Water, which has this year introduced reforms including a pay bargaining system in which increases are deter- mined through a company council of elected employees rather than direct negotiation with unions. This is the pay determination used by many Japanese companies, even those which recognise a union. Mr Temple says the com- pany council and other changes, such as improved team working and single status conditions for employees, drew on many influences of which Japanese practices were just one. However, he says, the nearby Nissan plant demon- strated it was possible to make the changes it wanted \"in a safe and sensible manner. We would probably have done what we did anyway but we will never know whether we would have felt so comfort- able.\" Not surprisingly, such changes do not please unions and at the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress this month, Japanese compa- nies came under fire for an \"alien approach to trade union organisation\". Some expressed their opposi- tion to beauty contests, used by Japanese and other employ- ers, in which unions parade themselves before employers in an attempt to win single union deals. Opposition was also voiced to no-strike agreements, although no union affiliated to the TUC will admit to having signed one. The TUC resolved to develop a joint union approach to all inward investors but virtually all unions accept that Japanese companies are unlikely to grant recognition deals which feature more than one of them.

The chances are that all these oods were made in the UK byBritish workers. Since Sony set up its televi- sion factoy inBridgend, South Wales in 1974, 21 other Japa- nese electronics companles have established manufactur- ing facilities In the UK. Epson makes printers In Telford, JVC turns out televisions in Glas- gow, Mitsubishi produces video cassette recorders (VCRs) in Livingston and Pioneer manu- factures compact.disc players in Wakefield. Having established them- selves in the UK. the Japanese electronics companies face a new challenge: satisfying demands in Britain that they design their products and buy more of their components locally. Almost all the large Japa- nese electronics manufacturers now have British plants. They have been attracted by the UK government's welcoming atti- tude, which has been in strong contrast to the anti-Japanese hostility occasionally found in other European countries. Britain's membership of the European Community meant the UK could be used as a base for exporting to the rest of the EC. There was also a dearth of strong Britishcomptor, par ticularly in the a t con- sumer electronics, where the Japanese in the UK have tended to concentrate their eforts. Added to this is that English tends to be the Japsa nese businessman's second lan guage. Only the most nar- row-minded of critics could deny the Japanese contribution to UK electronics over the past 18 years. Although there are no longer any substantial British- owned manufacturers of televi- sions, locally-based Japanese companies helped the UK record a Â£271m trade surplus in TVs last year. Japanese companies are expected to make 4m televi- sions in the UK this year, ris- ing to 6.8m by 1995. They will make 1.7m VCRs in the UK this year, increasing to 2.9m by 1995. The British government has long encouraged the influx of Japanese electronics compa- nies. Now, however, it is plac- ing greater emphasis on the quality rather than the quan- tity of Japanese electronics investment. The government's attitude was partly prompted by a study commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry, which found that Japanese manufacturers in the UK t only 15 per cOut of tihetreectronic components from local suppliers. The study by InterMlatfix, a consulting frm, revealed that the impm- sive local content figures recorded by some Japanese companies resulted largely from the local purchase of WZmatridal, preusln and and mechani- cal parts. There appearedto be less willingnessby the Japa- nese to buy the more techni- cally sophisticated electronic components in the UK. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, responded to the study by launching the Japan Electron- ics Business Association (Jeba) last June. Jeba aims to ensure that UK-based electronic com- ponent manufacturers boost sales to Japanese companies in Britain. InterMatrix estimated that total spending on electronic components by UK-based Japa- nese manufacturers would rise from the current Â£ibn annually to Â£l.7bn by 1995, an increase of 67 per cent. The reason that Japanese companies buy a relatively small proportion of their elec- tronic components in the UK, InterMatrix said, is that what goes into a particular elec- tronic product is specified by its designer. And despite the impressive increase in the manufacture of electronic Most of the goods manufactured In Japanese-owned plants In Britain are designed In Japan goods by Japanese companies in the UK, almost all those products are designed in Japan. \"Key components are there- fore specified in Japan and this inevitably tends to favour Jap- anese components - either supplied by Japanese compo- nent suppliers or by the Japa- nese subsidiaries of large west- ern components suppliers,\" InterMatrix said. There is nothing sinister about this reluctance to pur- chase electronic components locally. As the InterMatrix study points out, when Japa- nese companies set up a new factory in the UK their maJor concern is recruiting and train- ing a suitable workforce. \"To minimise the upheaval, ini- tially products or kits are brought in from Japan and assembled in the UK by a 'screwdriver' plant which adds little value and (sometimes lit- erally) screws parts together.\" As the operation becomes better established, the com- pany begins to buy sub-assem- blies locally and then moves on to purchasing its components in the UK. Not all of the com- panies supplying the compo- nents will be British-owned. Several Japanese sub-assembly and component manufacturers have set up in the UK. Although not UK-owned, these component makers, like the product manufacturers, do pro- vide employment in Britain. In the earlier years UK offi- cials' attitude to Japanese investment appeared most con- cerned about how many Brit- ish jobs would be created, but there is now a greater stress on encouraging manufacturers to deepen their commitment. A report to the National Eco- nomic Development Council (NEDC) earlier this year called on the UK government to encourage foreign investors to design as well as manufacture. The DTI is already encourag- ing Japanese companies to design products locally. Inter- Matrix says that the design that currently occurs in the UK tends to be the adaptation ofJApaneseesighned products for British use. There are trends, however, which will encourage Japanese companies i to do more basic design here. I One trend Is the need to pay closer attention to what the i customer wants. Japanese companies say they are increasingly noticing differ- i ences in the tastes of custom- ers in different countries. It is less and less easy to manufac- i ture a single product and i expect it to sell in all markets. SThe need to be closer to the Scustomer is likely to encourage . Japanese companies to do more product research and i development in the countries in which they sell. The UK cannot afford to be Scomplacent about attracting SJapanese research, develop- ment and design. Although SSony this year announced that SSouth Wales would be its Euro- - pean R and D centre, other - Japanese companies say that t German engineers and design- i ers tend to be better qualified.",

   "text_content" : "THE SPONSOR of an art exhibition currently running in Edinburgh entitled \"Behind Golden Screens\" is Livingston Development Corporation, which is usually associated with gritty advertisements tell- ing you why you or your busi- ness should relocate to this Scottish new town. Explaining the sponsorship, Mr Stuart Allison of the corporation says: \"We wanted to thank the Japanese for their investment in the town and for their contribution to our economy.\" The exhibition, of work from the Tokyo Fuji museum, is part of the Japan Festival. Although Japanese inward investors were slower in com- ing to Scotland than they were to Wales, Livingston, about 15 miles from Edinburgh, believes it has the largest number of them north of the border - 12 at the last count in a town of 40,000 people. Mr Allison says that the Jap- anese have created nearly 3,000 jobs in the electronic sector, invested about Â£300m and helped produce an unemploy- ment rate of only 7 per cent - about two points below the .Scottish average. The leading Japanese com- pany is NEC Semiconductors, which alone accounts for Â£158m worth of the Japanese investment in the town. NEC is significant partly because it was the first Japanese com- pany in Livingston, arriving in 1983. \"It was the catalyst,\" says Mr Allison. \"It opened the way to other electronics manufac- turers and to further Japanese investment.\" The other reason that NEC is significant is because since 1987 the plant has become the Japanese semiconductor maker's most important opera- tion in Europe. In 1984 it decided to move up from assembling and testing semi- conductors at Livingston to manufacturing the wafers there. The latest phase in NEC's investment at Livings- ton was a Â£40m project com- pleted last year to introduce production of the 4 megabit DRAM semiconductor. Mr Keilchi Shimakura, the managing director at Livings- ton, says his plant is the first \"School-leavers were too young. Now we are taking on those made redundant by other companies\" in Europe to make this product and that it brought it onstream at virtually the same time as NEC's plants in Japan. He lists \"achieving better productivity than the com- pany's plants in Japan\" as one his main objectives at Livings- ton, but it is not one which has yet been achieved. The plant now employs 780 people and is continuing to recruit It is moving away from its initial policy of taking on school-lea- vers at the age of 16 to recruit- ing people in their 30s, espe- cially women. \"The school-leavers were too young,\" he says. \"Generally speaking, they need educating until they are 18 to gain common sense and general knowledge. They ought really to have basic knowledge of mathematics and physics. Now we are taking on housewives and people made redundant by other companies.\" Mr Shimakura would like to see pupils leaving school \"with more basic knowledge and more discipline training.\" NEC, which operates shifts lasting 12 hours at a stretch in four-day bursts followed by four days off, helps smooth the entry of the new personnel and make NEC better known in the town by inviting the parents or husbands of staffto group parties in which they are intro- duced to the factory. \"Seeing is believing,\" he says. But an equally important human part of the operation is the insistence of NEC on \"total productivity maintenance\" which includes making the operators, as shopfloor staff are called, responsible for tidying up and cleaning their machines after the shift. The operators (of which there are nearly 500) initially argued that this was the job of cleaners. Another initiative is the zero defect (ZD) programme for which the operators are divided into 40 groups for their monthly meetings. Twice a year there is a ZD conference, from which those produce the best ZD ideas are given a free trip to Japan. Groups of work- ers are also sent to Japan for extra training. Significant Japanese compa- nies which have followed NEC to Livingston include Mitsubi- shi Electric, which makes video recorders and employs about 700, and Shin-Etsu Han- dotai which makes silicon wafers (and supplies NEC among others). Though the impact of the Japanese companies on Liv- ingston is easy to quantify in statistical terms, it is less easy to say how much the Japanese are changing Livingston, other companies in the town and the Livingston workforce not directly involved in Japanese plants. Mr Bill Gold, senior manager for personnel at NEC, says that the company has provided its expertise in ZD management and quality circles to other operations including local com- panies, the Royal Bank of Scot- land and the local health board. But he admits that in the case of some companies it is difficult to know if the Japa- nese experience really makes an impact. \"Companies often look for an easy solution, a quick fix,\" he says. \"They don't always realise these things have to be an integral part of the management style. \"It's hard to know whether they implement what they learn here because we tend not to hear from them much,\" he says. Mr Gold is vice-chairman of the council of West Lothian College, the local higher educa- tion institute which, though based in nearby Bathgate, recently opened a branch in Livingston. The college now does a considerable amount of training for Japanese and also US companies in the town, usually under contract on an in-house basis with individual companies. \"We adapt to their exact requirements,\" says Mr David Murray of the college. \"The Japanese are encouraging the college to keep up with their demands so that we provide the type of people they need.\" However, by keeping most training inside the plants, it is sometimes suggested that the Japanese companies do not share their operating methods and allow cross-fertilisation as much as they might do. \"The Japanese have begun to come out of their laager in the past few years,\" says one local observer, who points out many Japanese companies have moved to Livingston only in the past five years. \"But subjectively speaking I just wonder how much influ- ence they have on the local scene.\"",

   "text_content" : "IT WAS Shakespeare that ultimately brought the new managing director of YKK to London. But it is loyalty to his company that will send him wherever his skills are needed next. Mr \"Mac\" Hiroshi Nakahara, who was appointed managing director of YKK, the zip manu- facturers, at the start of August, has led a frenzied life in North America and Europe on behalf of his company. Now aged 42, he is unlikely to settle down for some time yet. His industrious spirit is reflected in his office in Lon- don: there is no fancy furniture nor elaborate decoration, just a plain room dominated by a rectangular table and simple chairs. Much of his time is spent travelling, meeting man- agers and staff at the different YKK sites, as well as key cus- tomers. A recording of Romeo and Juliet, brought to school by his teacher, helped inspire him to study English at Osaka Univer- sity of Foreign Studies. He joined YKK on graduating in April 1972, because the com- pany offered him a job two hours before another employer. He has never looked back. After a year as a sales trainee in Japan, he was sent to Monterrey in Canada, and within six weeks dispatched to Toronto, where as one of just six staff he says he did every- thing from sweeping the floor as they built up the site. In Janary 1975 he became operations manager at a YKK assembly plant in Chicago, and two years later was asked to set up a new depot in Cicin- nati and coordinate another In Cleveland. In 1962 he was appointed sales manager for the YKK eastern division head- quarters in New Jersy. Just over four year later, be was moved to Ma and then in April 97 to the U where he became general manager, based at headguarters in Lan- den, bat as with responsibil- my for mr depoits and a fc- try in Reaucorn, Chehire. \"ff the company wants to mh e a new challenge, and tasthat I sbould go else- where for my own sake, or heinlhee~ascatdablfaa~lte, Iwlltbehmytomseala,\" he lansm to seand his theeatemoe a aa for Santhe dektnw lhe in h i t _s ead sbese dot main et s* a ju cM- amI ae ofpa ^*tEel ye _at_ art, Nakahare and products ing on the UK in 1969, YKK set up a factory. Wherever feasi- ble, the company is committed to local production, partly to respond to local demand from the fashion industry, and partly because of its stress on becoming an international manufacturer, not simply a trading outlet of a Japanese organisation. Only 21 of the 340 employees in the UK are Japanese, while the compa seretary and one of the five brdmembers are British. Several senior manage- ment jobs are also held by UK nationals. It is a philosophy Mr Naka- hara eagerly embraces. \"We think this is an international company,\" he says. Japanese employees come on attachment to the UK, but British staff are also sent for training to Japan. He expects these exchanges to increase over the next few years. \"We need to understand each other's cultures,\" he says. \"That is a good thing.\" nRe over a cup of coAge in his offIce, he exudes a strong sense of pragmatism and fleiuiity.

Yet he dismisses any sugges- tions that the workforce is expected to conform to a \"Jap- anese\" way of doing things. \"In the factory, staff wear uni- forms for safety reasons,\" he says. \"In the office I don't Insist on it for others, but Ijust find it more comfortable myself.\" He rejects suggestions that the company operates some- how in a \"Japanese\" way, or that good British management practices are so different. \"What is 'British' or 'Japanese' management?\" he asks. \"The cultural characteristics in the places I have worked vary a little bit country by country,\" he says, \"but the business tar- gets and goals are not so differ- ent.\" He says there is probably less hierarchy in Japanese companies than some of their counterparts overseas, with a stress on listening to each employee and adopting their suggestions for Improvement. Working hours are not exces- sive: 9am to 5pm in the office, and Sam to 5pm at the factory, with an earlier close on Fri- days.

   "text_content" : "Filled with gidish gle - Japanes and English pupils at Putney Park School, London THE EDUCATION of Japanese children in the UK has under- gone a revolution over the past few years, from what parents saw as an unfortunate neces- sity to a positive advantage. \"The main trend is of very rapid change, from isolation to realisation of the benefits of being overseas,\" says Roger Goodman, an anthropologist who is reader in Japanese studies at the University of Essex. Ten years ago, it was extremely difficult in Japan for children returning from abroad. They were stigmatised, and viewed as disruptive. Spe- cial schools were set up to help re-orient them. Now these chil- dren have much higher status. \"Parents are beginning to make the most of being over- seas,\" he says. Goodman, author of Japan's International Youth, is one of a few Western academics to have studied the topic of Japanese children educated overseas. However, in Japan, the subject has recently been widely researched. Partly, there has been a questioning of the value of tra- ditional Japanese education. \"There is a feeling now that studying overseas is positive, that students come back more creative and individualistic,\" he says. \"The children have done extremely well and so parents are prepared to be more adventurous.\" There is growing rhetoric about the need to \"internation lise\" Japan. \"Parents with a greater experience of foreign cultures are taking the risk of investing in the international experience,\" says Goodman. \"The status of those living overseas has changed.\" Given the high degree of influence wielded by those posted abroad - diplomats, business executives, journal- ists and others - there has also been significant pressure to recognise the difficulties of children reentering the Japa nese education system. As a result, there are now special programmes and places allocated in high schools and universities for those schooled overseas. There are even cases of parents in Japan sending their children abroad to gain access to this preferential treatment. According to the Japanese embassy in London, there are more than 4,500 Japanese chil- dren in schools in the UK. Most parents are posted for just a few years, so the expo- sure their children have to schooling is short-term and varies widely. Many use conventional Brit- ish schools at some stage, although there is also a signifi- cantly-sized conservative group, who fear a backlash against the current tolerance and tend to steer clear of Brit- ish education. After a British infant school, many children are sent to Jap- anese-run schools, and des- patched back to Japan at 15 for High School, possibly as board- ers, where they prepare for university. Goodman says there is a strong gender divi- sion, with boys treated more conservatively in Japanese- style. While a growing number of Japanese now study at British universities, most pupils still return home for higher educa- tion. \"Your whole social status in Japan is based on which university you went to,\" says Goodman. \"It is especially important among elite groups.\" Japanese students are more likely to return to the UK or the US afterwards, for a post- graduate degree. There are a handful of schools in the UK specifically established and run along Jap- anese lines, including Rikkyo College in Horsham, Surrey, the oldest such school in Europe, and the Japanese School in London, in Acton, is sponsored by the Japanese gov- ernment. They tend to repli- cate the Japanese school sys- tern: highly centralised, with an emphasis on rote learning and many exams, and with a timetable and curriculum con- trolled by the government in Tokyo. Most teachers are sent on short-term contracts from Japan, and many may not even speak English. Locally-re- cruited teachers who have lived in the UK for a longer time have much lower status, salary and influence within the schools,- even though they often act as intermediaries to the community because their spoken English is much stron- ger, says Goodman. Even parents who send their children to British schools worry about them being left behind in the education race. As a result, several Japanese schools offer weekend courses. There are also several \"cram- mers\" imported from Japan, which young people attend after school and on weekends for intensive tuition. At least one crammer based in Japan operates by sending faxes with work assignments to children in Britain, which are then sent back to be marked. Mr Ralph Mowat, principal of the International Study Cen- tre at Sherborne School, which prepares foreign students for entrance into independent schools, says there is a wide range of ability among the Jap- anese children he has taught. \"They are not all equally hard working and studious,\" he says. \"Quite a number have the same problems as English pupils, but they tend to be under a great deal of parental pressure.\" He says the school has taken the children of Japanese par- ents based in the UK, but also from an increasing number of parents living in Japan, who perhaps have travelled over- seas and want the benefit of British education or fluency in English. Adjustment can cause difficulties. \"Japanese classes are large, and the pupils sit and listen. Here we encourage boys to ask questions and par- ticipate.\" Susan Brown, head of Wes- sex Gardens Infant school in north west London, which has several Japanese children each year, says most are extremely numerate, perhaps having been tutored at home. She also says that the parents tend to be very willing to participate in school, attending classes and helping with activities. \"There is a lot of pressure on children in the schools in Japan,\" she says. \"I think the parents like the more relaxed atmosphere here.\"",

   "text_content" : "THE prominence of Japanese financial Institutions In London has faded some- what in the last year or so, as the pres- sures of meeting new bank capital requirements forced Institutions to rein in their ambitions. At the same time, a spate of financial scandals at home has refo- cused Japanese banks' and securities firms' attention on their own domestic market. Of the innumerable Institutions which made their way to London during the 1980s, some have had the muscle to estab- lish themselves in a highly competitive market, a few have become niche players; but others have found it hard to come to terms with international markets, and are in retreat Towards the end of last year, declines in the Japanese stock market left Japa- nese financial institutions, which hold large amounts of assets in stocks, in a precarious position. \"They were facing more stringent conditions than ever before. The (Japanese) economy had been consistently quite bullish since the end of the second World War,\" explains a Japa- nese banker based in London. \"The tighter restrictions came as a blow, not just in practical terms but also in psycho- logical terms. It was a culture shock.\" The change in banks' capacity to lend forced them to review their strategies and re-adjust criteria for assessing asset qual- ity. The net result was that some banks retreated from lending activities. Although large banks are unlikely to desert the London market, some Japanese banks with smaller balance sheets ecde to return to their traditional retail-ori- ented business. \"But if they do go back home, they'll be facing a highly competi- tive market there too,\" one banker pointed out As well as the current economic cli- mate, some negative experiences have also coloured the minds of some Japanese bankers. For example, Japanese banks are among lenders to Brent Walker, the UK leisure group which recently called In the Serious Fraud Office and faces possible liquidation, and Ferranti, the financially troubled defence group. During the 198I0s, Japanese enthusiasm for building up their lending business helped drive down borrowing costs for European borrowers, many of which became much more highly leveraged. As borrowing costs rose in the last few years, a number of borrowers have run into dif- ficulties. Japanese, and indeed other for- eign banks, have found themselves with substantial exposure to once-solid UK companies which were forced to restruc- ture their debt. This experience has not just been lim- ited to the UK. For example, banks gener- ally prefer to lend to government, rather than corporate, credits, but even in this area they have been wounded, as in the case of Federconsorzi, the Italian farm services cooperative, which they expected to be bailed out by the Italian govern- ment, should the need arise. One of the attractions of the liberal financial markets of Europe was that it allowed Japan's rigidly divided fnancial institutions to become involved in new areas of business. For the most part, the interest in the UK equities market has been mainly with the aim of distributing UK equity Ia Japan. Few houses have tried to gain a foothold in the highly competitive UK domestic market In the more international bond mar- kets, and especially in the Eurobond mar- ket, Japanese institutions have been more prominent. Both Daiwa and Nomura are market makers in gilts. Various Japanese houses are among the strongest players not only in the yen sector of the Eurobond market, but also in dollars and increas- ingly in the Ecu. But to date their most important contri- bution has been in the equity-linked mar- ket. In the 1980s, when many interna- tional banks suffered from declining profit margins, the Japanese securities houses provided a money spinner which not only buoyed their own profitability but probably kept a number of foreign houses from going into the red. But the recent poor performance of the Japanese stock market has taken some of the shine off the equity warrants market. Although the volume of new issues has fallen, and deals are no longer trading substantially above issue price, the busi- ness remains profitable for new issues houses.",

   "text_content" : "FOR Mr Yoshio Osawa, head of IBJ International, London is the pre-eminent financial centre, where he considers him- self \"lucky enough to be assigned for a second time\". Despite the threats posed by Frankfurt and Paris, he believes the array of international talent available in London is unrivalled. In addition to its deregulated markets, one of London's main distinctions is that it immediately offers more possibilities to the newcomer than would be available to foreign institutions coming to Tokyo. However, Mr Osawa points out that it was only after Big Bang and only when the capital strength of UK banks went into reverse that London was willing to rid itself of similar collusive practices. And that was only four years ago. Japanese institutions which come to London thinking they will be accepted on the merits of their financial strength are deluding themselves. \"It is only when you have demonstrated that you are willing to play the game as members see it and according to their rules, and furthermore that you have something of added value to offer, that newcomers are accorded full membership to the British financial community,\", Mr Osawa says. He thinks that perhaps only two or three Japanese financial institutions have achieved that status, although he will not say which institutions he has in mind. On the other hand, activities that indi- cate a willingness to provide investors with helpful services win high marks among British financial institutions. Some of the Japanese electric power companies have stepped up investor rela- tions activities and the Japan Develop- ment Bank has been making the rounds of foreign investors, asking them under what circumstances they would be interested in buying JDB bonds. But Japan still lags far behind the west in investor relations activities. Bond issu- ers have simply relied on the marketing strength of a lead underwriter chosen by them from among the big four brokers to make the issue a success. Much of what financiers learn in Lon- don will serve them well as Japan's sinan- cial markets face deregulation and compe- tition in the industry intensifies as the colusive structure gives way to a greater reliance on market forces. Their experience outside their cosy envi- ronment of their domestic market has already raised an awareness among Japa- nese financial institutions of the need for risk management and internal controls. These have been introduced to some extent in their overseas operations. \"The next step,\" Mr Osawa says, \"is to do the same for their domestic operations,\" a much-needed step, as the recent financial scandals in Japan have demonstrated.

   "text_content" : "Bracken House, thei former FT headquarters, undergoing refurbishment for its new owners THE IN ofovrerseas investors into th itthe MSK prprty market, partic- ularly in the tyof London, has been a significant feature since the mid-1980s. Aid of all the oversenas investors, the Japanese have been the most prominent Now, although the pace of Japa- nese activity has noticeably slowed, it is still Japanese transactions that are hitting the headlines. In late August two City deals together worth Â£290m were announced - very welcome news in a severely depressed market even though it was common knowledge that both had been in the negotia- tion pipeline for over a year. The first of the two deals involved the sale of a 50 per cent stake in con- struction group George Wimpey's Little Britain development, 90 per cent let to legal firm Clifford Chance, for Â£110m to Japanese insurance company Nippon Life. The second was the sale of Rose- haugh Stanhope Developments' Exchange House, phase 7 of Broad- gate, to the American-led Pruden- tial Global Real Estate Programme for Â£180m. In this deal too it is likely that at least some of the money was Japanese although it has been cloaked by a \"confidential- ity\" clause which is often insisted upon by the Japanese. The importance of overseas investment in the City, and in par- ticular Japanese investment, is highlighted by surveyor Richard Ellis. The firm's Mr Alan Froggatt points to the fact that in 1985 over three-quarters of City property investment was undertaken by domestic UK institutions and prop- erty companies. By 1989 the balance had shifted and overseas investors accounted for some two-thirds of the total. Richard Ellis puts the Jap- anese contribution that year at around Â£900m - three times the level of commitment made in each of the previous two years. Figures from surveyor Jones Lang Wootton show that in 1990 capital transactions in the City added up to Â£1.84bn. The Japanese share of that was 42 per cent. In the first six months of 1991 JLW reck- ons that the total was Â£642m and the Japanese slice was 24 per cent. Japanese movement into UK property has followed a clear path. First to put their toes into the water - albeit with a fairly large splash - were the construction companies. The first sizeable acquisition was by contractor Kumagai Gumi which bought the former Post Office site at St Martin's-le-Grand in 1985, then in partnership with Mr Julian Mark- ham's Glengate Holdings. This 270,000 sq ft development behind the existing facade was bought by the Nomura Group. It was not simply the prospect of the European single market and London's position within it that made Kumagai and other contrac- tors decide to try their luck in the UK. They had, says Mr Froggatt, half an eye on the scene back at home. For instance Kumagai was not then one of the top five Japa- nese contractors and wanted to boost its turnover so as to secure automatic inclusion in domestic tender lists. Kumagai, which took over Mr Gerald Powell's Ranelagh Develop- ments, has subsequently spread its wings much further than the City. Among current projects, it is involved in a joint venture 1.lm sq ft project at Broomielaw in Scot. land; its 180,000 sq ft office develop- ment in Reading is pre-let to the Prudential and at Central Park in Watford the 53,400 sq ft Oak House is let to the French Rh6ne-Poulenc. In the City its Â£200m Whitefriars development on the site of the for- mer Sun printing works, let to legal firm Freshfields, has received the first ever City Heritage New Archi- tecture Award; and its 194,000 sq ft development at 55 Bishopsgate is substantially pre-let. Another contractor, Obayashi, bought the former Financial Times headquarters, Bracken House, in 1987 for Â£143m - a price which raised a few eyebrows even at that time when City property was approaching the height of the boom. Japanese development and real estate companies and traders fol- lowed into the UK hard on the heels of the contractors. Mitsui Real Estate and Mitsubishi Real Estate were both involved in transactions in London in 1985. And 1986 saw five acquisitions by Japanese devel- opers with a total value of Â£250m - a figure which at Â£450m, in 11 deals, was almost doubled in 1987, accord- ing to Mr David Glascock of Weath- erall Green & Smith's Tokyo office. During 1989, he adds, there were no fewer than 27 big acquisitions in the UK by Japanese companies. Of these 13 were made by trading, development and real estate compa- nies and seven by others including individual entrepreneurs and con- sortia. But 1989 was particularly sig- nificant because it marked the entry Into the London market of the Japanese life companies. he first was Dal-ichi Life which bought the Randsworth Centre in Wilsn Street in the City for around Â£9m. This was followed by Yasuda Life's Â£140m purchase of the Talsal/Ham- mnerson joint development at Fins- bury Circus and Asahi Life's acqui- sition of Leadenhall Court at just under Â£120m. Nippon Life, Chlyoda Life and Sumiomo Life also bought London investment properties in 1989. Japanese insurance companies were even more prominent in the market in 1980 with Sumitomo Life taking 52.5 per cent of J. P. Mor- gan's Morgan Place in Tudor Street for Â£220m, the largest life company purchase to date. Dal-ichi bought a 50 per cent stake in Minster Court, Mark Lane on a joint venture basis and Meiji Life took a 50 per cent interest in Peterborough Court, Fleet Street with Goldman Sachs by way of a convertible mortgage. Further life companies are known to be keen to buy in London. But factors both in Japan and in the UK are likely to limit activity. Higher Japanese domestic interest rates from 1989 saw life company pre- mium income dip considerably as savers put their money into banks or alternative investments, taking advantage of higher interest rates. The knock-on effect has been that there is less in the life companies' kitties to spend on overseas real estate. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, whose approval is necessary for overseas purchases by life companies, has been dragging its heels over its decisions - all part of current pol- icy of encouraging investment funds to stay in Japan as far as possible. Developers and traders, reliant on cheap bank finance, have also been affected. They have already suffered increased costs on existing loans and are reluctant to increase expo- sure with new loans. Besides which, the Bank of Japan has taken steps to restrict the volume of bank lend- ing for speculative real estate trans- actions. There is no doubt that the Japa- nese will continue to play an influ- ential role in the UK property mar- ket. But their own domestic concerns, combined with the cur- rent woeful state of the UK property market, mean that in the short term their activity will continue at a slower pace and at a lower volume. It is unlikely that we shall see the levels of the late 1960s again, says Mr John Stephen of Jones Lang Wootton. But he considers activity will resume at a steady pace in the medium term. Despite the ambitions of Paris and Frankfurt to assume the status of financial capital of Europe, it appears that the Japanese have come down firmly in favour of Lon- don as their main avenue of Euro- pean property investment. They have undertaken limited activity in other European cities, notably Frankfurt, and are taking a keen interest in the former eastern bloc countries. However, in the main, Japanese interest centres on good quality, well-let buildings in large lot sizes. The supply of such buildings is lim- ited. But there are more of them in London than in Frankfurt or Paris.",

   "text_content" : "JAPANESE companies have been much more reluctant than their European and US counterparts to set up research and development facilities overseas. No Japanese com- pany conducts R&D on a truly global scale, like IBM in com- puting, Philips in electronics, General Motors in cars and Bayer in chemicals and phar- maceuticals. Even so, Britain is undoubt- edly the favourite location for Japanese companies deciding to carry out R&D in Europe. \"The UK is in Japanese eyes a promising R&D location with good researchers, culturally close to the US yet politically part of Europe,\" says Mr Chris Floyd, a technology consultant with Arthur D. Little, who has studied Japanese attitudes to R&D. \"The British are regarded as creative people, and there is a real sense in Japan that UK universities are better than other European or US universi- ties, in terms of their research.\" About 30 Japanese compa- nies now claim to have R&D facilities in the UK, although the majority are on a small scale with just a handful of staff doing design or develop- ment work for the local mar- ket. Only a dozen carry out fundamental scientific research or development work for the world market. Most are in the industries where Japan is a global leader, such as electronics, electrical engineering and vehicles. Less predictable, perhaps, is the Japanese pharmaceutical industry - still lagging behind Europe and the US but nursing global expansion plans. Eisai and Yamanouchi, two of Japan's most outward- looking drug companies, are investing substantial sums in UK research. Eisai is committing Â£50m over the next 15 years to build and run a neurosciences research centre at University College, London (UCL) - the largest and longest-term fund- ing arrangement any company has made with a UK univer- sity. The centre's American direc- tor, Dr Lee Rubin, has just been recruited from Athena Neurosciences, a California biotechnology company, and the laboratory is due to open in autumn 1992 with an initial staff of 30 researchers. They will concentrate on disorders of the central nervous system such as Alzheimer's and Par- kinson's diseases. Yamanouchi Research Insti- tute (UK) has been operating for a year in a converted ward at Littlemore Hospital, origi- nally a Victorian lunatic asy- lum, on the outskirts of Oxford. Its research field is cell biology - and in particularly the cellular processes that give rise to disease. Dr John Lackie, who was recruited from Glasgow Uni- versity to direct the Yamanou- chi institute, now has 25 staff. SThe project is about to move Son to its second phase, which I will involve converting a sec- Sond large ward to laboratory space and eventually recruit- ing a dozen more researchers. I \"Our interaction with Yamanouchi in Tokyo has been very happy,\" said Dr Lackie. \"The fact that they are willing to invest more money at this early stage shows how I supportive they've been.\" Unlike the Eisai centre on the UCL campus, the Yaman- Souchi institute is not formally part of Oxford University. But, Dr Lackie says, \"we are begin- ning to fit ourselves into the academic scene.\" As a first step, the institute has funded a research fellowship in cell biol- ogy at Wolfson College, Oxford. The Yamanouchi institute is within sight of the new Oxford Science Park, whose first ten- ant will be Sharp Laboratories of Europe (SLE) - the Euro- pean R&D headquarters of Sharp, the giant Japanese elec- tronics company. SLE was set up last year in temporary offices in Abingdon, near Oxford, and will move next spring to two permanent build- ings on a four acre site on the science park. The staff will expand then from 31 today (of whom 22 are directly engaged in research) to a full comple- ment of about 50 people. SLE is focusing on opto-elec- tronics, information technol- ogy and imaging technology, \"at a basic research level between blue sky research and product development\". The University of Surrey Research Park in Guildford is host to two Japanese R&D cen- tres: Canon Research Europe and Kobe Steel European Research Centre. Canon, the photographic and electronics company, carries out two distinct areas of research at its Guildford cen- tre, which was established in 1988. One is visual program. ming languages - software enabling computers to process pictures. Canon's other area of UK research is audio. Its first prod- uct, a loudspeaker system called Wide Imaging Stereo, was launched in June. WIS, which gives a better all-round stereo effect than conventional systems, was invented person- ally by Mr Hiro Negishi, head of Canon Research Europe, and then developed into a finished product by a team of British acoustic engineers. \"I believe that if I had been in Japan I would probably never have imagined or devel- oped WIS technology,\" he says. \"The British audio culture, environment and infrastruc- ture allowed me to bring ideas to reality.\" Kobe Steel is not only expanding geographically beyond Japan but also diversi- fying away from metals into other industrial materials. The Surrey laboratory, opened in 1990, works on polymers. To help establish the labora- tory, Kobe employed the distin- guished polymer chemist Sir Geoffrey Allen, who had just retired as research director of Unilever and was previously head of the Science and Engi- neering Research Council. Kobe's use of Sir Geoffrey is typical of the Japanese approach to R&D in the UK, says Mr Floyd of Arthur D. Lit- tle. \"Japanese companies have been very careful to anchor their research centres here in some sort of respectability.\" The appointment of distin- guished consultants is one symptom. Another is the choice of respectable universi- ties such as Cambridge, where the electronics giants Toshiba and Hitachi have located research laboratories. Other well-known Japanese companies with UK R&D activ- ities include Sony, Nissan and Fujitsu. More, including Pana- sonic (Matsushita) and NEC, have UK design centres. However, as Mr Floyd points out, many more large and innovative Japanese compa- iles - such as Kyocera, Mitsu- bishi, NKK and Minolta - still do no significant R&D in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. He believes the internation- alisation of Japanese research is very much in the interests both of the companies and of the countries where they set up facilities. But the British government should promote the UK more actively as an R&D location.",

   "text_content" : "TO say that the Japanese have become infatuated with golf is an understatement on a par with saying that they are good at making electronic equip- ment. Only a small percentage of Japan's population play the game and only 15 per cent of these graduate from practice ranges to try their skills on a course. But golf has taken hold in Japan and on the Japanese with a vengeance. Big depart- ment stores in Tokyo have indoor putting greens and sand-filled bunkers. There's even a brothel called the \"Hole- in-One\" with a putting green in the lobby. Today Japan is golf-kichigai, which means golf crazy. Noth- ing can convey the enthusiasm the Japanese have for golf so much as the Shiba Golf driving range in Tokyo. There in a three-storey building that never closes, 155 golfers who booked their tee-times two weeks earlier hit so many balls it looks to the bystander as though it's hailing. The balls fly into 100-foot-high nets and drop to a 300-yard-wide rubber mat covering the .pound. Like The Windmill. The Shiba never cloae. The importance of golf In Japan is demonstrated daily in two ways. The first la by the existence of the Nikkei Golf Membership Index, which charts the rise of membership fees at Japanese golf clubs. The second is the number of adver- tisements in the Tokyo sinan- cial papers placed by compa- nies advertising papular club memberships for sale and the names of clubs for which they have buyers. Popular as it is in Japan, even golf has been affected by the recession. In March 1990 the NGMI peaked at 948, up more than 50 per cent in the previous eight months. Within a year it had fallen by more than 300 points. The average price of membership of a club in Japan in July, the last avail- able figure, was Y32.18m, down from Y34.9m in three months. In July a leading dealer in golf club memberships filed for court protection, citing out- standing debts of Y260bn. It was Japan's second largest cor- porate failure this year and the fourth biggest on record. Earlier this month, a leading Japanese golf course developer was declared insolvent with outstanding debts of Y1lObn. The company had tried to capi- talise on the interest in golf club membership but had allegedly issued nearly 50,000 bmemberships instead of the promised 2,00. As bowling declined in popu- larity in Japan, so the popular- ity of golf spread perhaps because, as A. A. Milne once put it, \"it is the best game in the world at which to e bad\". Now, it has become such a national pastime that going to the driving range has become an event in itself. There are now rangebags in Japan, bags containing the three clubs you carry on your way to the driv- ing range. In a land with nearly 14m golfers, there are fewer than 2,000 courses. This scarcity, in part created by the shortage of oand, means that membership of a golf club is expensive. Per- haps the most expensive of all is a country club in Tokyo which costs more than Â£lm to join - and that's before the a subscriptions. Green fees at clubs around - Tokyo range from Â£10n to 200. But that's just the half of it. A ball costs Â£5 adM even to hit at a driving rangereqire ut book a tee time wee s in advance. Play golf in Japan and you get an idea of what the future holds. At one course outside Tokyo, golf bags are carried by monorail operated by remote control by caddies. Some courses do not have escalators but skylators, or moving rub- ber walkways. There's a craze in Japan for inhaling oxygen before playing. It is said to calm the nerves and help con- centration. And when you com- plete a round and are about to enter the clubhouse you don't scrape your golf shoes outside the door, you use a high pres- sure air hose to blow the mud off them. Life is less pleasant for the Japanese golfers around the world. In Britain, they have become the new outcasts, in succession to Jews and women golfers. Their ambassador to l*wnguu in lyn: gu 1aww 90mu9 - away on a uriving rung. uwi, imw Inw wimnuiii uIwEir, nVWFr close Britain plays at Sunningdale but many of his fellow country- men have to make occasional raids on accommodating courses or take their turns at driving ranges. The problem is partly racist. Golf club members in the UK are among the greatest of all racists, anti-Semites, anti- blacks, anti-women. Memories of the war take time to heal. It is also a question of culture. The way the Japanese play is entirely foreign to the British ethos. In Japan a round of golf is an all-day event. There is nine holes in the morning fol- lowed by a beer, sake, a soak in a hot bath before setting out for the second nine. Allowing for travelling time, many Japa- nese have to get up at six or seven to get to the course and won't get home again until late in the evening. In Britain, golf is a three or four-hour pastime followed by a quick drink in the 19th hole, the clubhouse. Unable to play in Japan, unable to play in the UK, the Japanese have taken to buying courses. They have a financial interest in the Old Course hotel at St Andrews, the home of golf. The first golf club in Britain to be bought by the Japanese was Old Thorns, built in 1982 near Liphook, Hamp- shire, and designed by David Thomas and Peter Alliss, the BBC TV golf commentator. When it was bought by Lon- don Kosaido, its name was changed to the London Kosaido golf course, Japanese- style communal baths were installed and a 28-room hotel, Japanese restaurant and bar were built. Camberley Heath golf club was recently bought by the Japanese. Hitoshi Matsuura, president of Nitto Kogyo, the Tokyo leisure group, is a golf fanatic. He watched BBC TV's pro-celebrity golf series when it was broadcast from Turn- berry, Scotland, and bought the famous course on the west coast for Â£14m without looking at it. The reason for the urge to buy into golf was that Japan had a strong currency and its business commupity has a strong natural acquisitiveness. Japanese entrepreneurs have bought 18 of Hawaii's 47 golf courses and every week-end they fly in parties of Japanese for whom the flight and green fees are cheaper than a round at home. The yen is weaker now, the cost of golf club memberships in Japan is lower than it used to be. But make no mistake. Japan is still golf kichigai. John Hopkins writes on golf for the Weekend FT",

   "text_content" : "A RECENT visitor to Whitgift School in South Croydon, a state primary, would have seen 10-year-old children undergo- ing a lesson in modern Japa- nese. The handful of children at Whitgift, a pioneer in the UK, represent the youngest class in a nationwide \"school\" of more than 12,000 students studying Japanese at all levels. The watershed was the Hay- ter Report of 1963, which called for new centres to study post- war Japanese language, cul- ture and society. Since then, demand for teachers and post- graduate research facilities has threatened to outstrip supply. The trend, seen by the gov- ernment as a response to Japa- nese economic competition, was further fuelled in 1987 by Sir Peter Parker's report Speaking for the Future, which recommended more British government money for Japa- nese studies. In recent years, Japanese government and industry have - also become important bene- factors of UK universities. In the 1980s Japanese Studies spread out from the original four centres at Cam- bridge, Oxford, Sheffield and the London School of Oriental and African Studies. Between 1986 and 1989, cen- tres sprang up at Cardiff, Essex, Newcastle-Durham, and Stirling. Japanese-related courses were also initiated at 17 other places including Aston, Bath College of Higher Education, Edinburgh, the London School of Economics and Political Science, Manches- ter, Oxford Polytechnic, Sunderland Polytechnic, Uni- versity of Ulster and Warwick. According to the Japan Foundation Endowment Com- mittee, between 1983 and 1988, the number of undergraduates studying Japanese rose from about 150 to 300. (The commit- tee was founded in 1974 to administer funds in UK univer- sities.) The nature of the courses also changed: instead of dwell- ing primarily on language and culture, they now also aim to instil students with a practical or cultural insight into modern Japan. Dr Mark Collick, director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Sheffield University, the leading \"Hayter centre\", says: \"We don't feel it neces- sary any longer to go out of our way to be different; we feel the battle has been won.\" Dr Phillip Harries, lecturer in Japanese at Oxford Univer- sity, says of the last decade: \"We have not yet settled down from that expansion.\" At Oxford, Japanese studies take place within the Faculty of Oriental Studies and the Nissan Institute of Japanese Studies, which was founded in 1981 with a grant from the Nis- san Motor Company, and is to be re-sited in a purpose-built building at St Antony's College following a second Nissan grant. A Japanese business studies class for sixth formers of Westminster School, London Dr Harries agrees that there is less of an argument in the 1990s between the traditional and the Hayter approaches. \"It is felt that you need a broad base, it's very hard to do it all the Hayter way.\" Oxford has recently opened an office in Tokyo, headed by Dr David Morris, a specialist in contemporary Japanese politics. Several colleges have developed links with Japan. Keble College offers tutorial fellowships funded by Industrial Bank of Japan. Tokyo Electric Power funds the fellowship at Pembroke College, and Kobe Steel and other Japanese companies give support to St Catherine's College. Prof Richard Bowering, at Cambridge, believes a centre is needed in the UK to teach Jap- anese studies \"in a non-US con- text\". It would provide a base for fashioning a \"European attitude to Japan\". He points out that each of the top 30 libraries in US have double the resource base of the largest in the UK. The major source of funds in Japanese Studies at Cambridge is Fuji Bank. A recent grant came from Mitsui Marine Insurance in the shape of Â£650,000 worth of microfilm documents. If the UK were ever to rival the US, where more students at Harvard study Japanese than French, the change would have to start in the schools. Ms Joyce Jenkins, executive secre- tary of the Japan Language Association, notes that in the last four years the number of non-university courses has risen more than 10-fold to 320. The language is now taught at some 58 state secondary schools and 17 private schools. Japanese studies in the UK are supported by a network of organisations. In addition to the Japan Foundation Endow- ment Committee, there is the British Association for Japa- nese Studies, founded in 1974, which has recently published a new journal, Japan Forum. Both the Great Britain-Sas- kawa Foundation and the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Founda- tion finance Japanese studies at university and secondary schools; and the UK/Japan 2000 Group, established in 1985, pro- motes high-level contacts in politics, business and culture.",

   "text_content" : "THE VIEW that \"England isa museum,\" as one To o trade official put it, more or less sums up the initial impression of most Japanese expatriates who have newly arrived in this country. The centuries-old buildings that are still inhabited, the eerie warnings to \"mind the gap,\" as the underground train squeals into the platform, even the black cab with their man- ual doors, all nark back to an age that to most Japanese belong In novels and 1920s movies. But museums have a lot to offer in lessons of survival and the Japanese visitor soon finds that there are shining exam- ples of qualities that have tended to be lost in the hustle and bustle of modern-day SJapan. Patience, for example, Sis a virtue that was much val- a ued when Japan still rmeme a bored its Conifian heritage.

The machine demanded \"exact change only\" and, 11 being late on a Sunday even 1 Shining examples of qualities that have a been lost In the bustle r of modemrn-day Japan ing, the customer service T booth, needless to say, wai Sclosed.

The next passenger whp His confusion bcame amazement as hie saw what the British do In such circumstanse walked up to the \"exact change only\" machine did not have the correct change either. But, without a trace of anger or sur- prise, he simply waited by the machine until enough small change had been fed into it by other passengers and the \"exact change\" sign was replaced by one that said \"all coins accepted\". Another lesson the Japanese quickly learn in London is that there is more than one solution to a problem. A businessman from Hiro- shima, now living in Maiden- head, illustrates the point with the story of his shower. He had agreed to rent a flat on condition that the landlord installed an extra shower in one of the bathrooms. The first time he took a shower, he discovered to his dismay that water flowed over the bottom of the shower com- partment on to the bathroom floor. Japanese v rs In London mrvl at vw 'the eM-o buildings are p Inhabited' Japanese vistorn In London marvel *t the view: 'the centuries-oMd buildings *re still lnhabiled' But when he asked his land- lord to raise the rim of the compartment, he was told that there should be no problem with the water overflowing - all he had to do was make sure he did not run his shower for more than five minutes at a time. My personal view of England has been coloured by my expe- rience at a London hairdresser. The woman who cut my hair was very chatty and relaxed - she took sips from her cup of coffee in between snips at my hair. But it does not take too long for most Japanese to adjust to the British way of life, judging from the testimony of a young housewife in Surrey. \"When I first came to England,\" she says \"I used to get very upset when people did not come at the agreed time. \"But the other day, when our plumber appeared on the day of our appointment, I was so glad that he even showed up at all, it hardly mattered that he wasn't on time.\" Many Japanese would agree that their encounters with the more relaxed British attitude to life can have a very positive effect. The west is united in its view that the Japanese need to learn to relax and to work less. There is general agreement in Japan as well that the new generation should be encour- aged to adopt a more creative approach to things. But for others, their experi- ence in Britain is still a stark reminder of what awaits them when they relax their grip too much or stop working, as some would say, like ants.",

   "text_content" : "MRS Masako Tomihara could almost be mistaken for an estate agent as she enthuses about her home in Sutton, Sur- rey ... \"three storeys, five bed- rooms, a double garage and a large garden.\" Compared with her rented apartment in the suburban sprawl of Tokyo's western dis- trict of Shibuya, Mrs Tomihara sees substantial benefits in liv- ing in the UK. She talks enthu- siastically about the opportuni- ties the sojourn in Britain will offer her and her family. \"We were very excited when we first came to England. And we are very impressed by how green everything is in Surrey,\" she says. One of her daughters summed up the contrast between London and Tokyo when they first arrived, she says. \"She said she was sur- prised that English houses had such big parks. Of course, she meant gardens - although she called them parks,\" laughs Mrs Tomihara. Two years ago Mrs Tomihara and her family came to the UK, At home, they did not own a car. Now not only do they have one, but the company changes It every year when her husband, Mr Yoichi Tomihara, became manager of the Toyota Motor Corporation in London. Originally, the plan was for the Tomihara family to return to Japan next April, but they have enjoyed their brief stayrso-much that they have extended their overseas post- ing for three or four years. The housing situation is not the only thing that has proven pleasantly surprising. Even though Mr Tomihara was a Toyota executive in Japan, the family did not own a car. Now not only do they have their own car, but the company changes it every year. Though clearly revelling in her new lifestyle, Mrs Tomi- hara found London quite a cul- ture shock after life in Tokyo. When the family first moved to the UK they settled in Harrow in North London. \"We were very disappointed. There was a lot of rubbish on the roads. And we were not happy about the state school where we sent our daughters.\" She and her husband looked at the possibility of sending their daughters to a private London school, but found there were no places and the fees were high. They decided instead to move to Sutton, where their two daughters, Sayaka, aged 10, and Kana, seven, attend the local state primary schooL Mrs Tomihara is impressed by the teaching, the discipline and the facilities. \"They have a big swimming pool there. I never thought they would have that in an English state school.\" The extravert Mrs Tomihara and her husband, like many Japanese couples, have taken advantage of the golfing facili- ties in the UK. Clubs such as the Old Thorns, at Liphook, and Camberley Heath, for example, are both Japanese ownes. Old Thorns even has Japanese food, Japanese baths and rice paper partitions. Mrs Tomihara is thinking of taking up horse-riding - a pas- time almost unheard of in urban Japan because of space limitations there. But she believes the biggest opportunity in coming to the UK has been for her children to learn English. A fluent English speaker herself, she W was keen for her children to attend an English school and become bilingual Due to their \"talkative per- sonalities\", as she puts it, the plan seems to be working. Her daughters, she reports, enjoy the British school system, which she believes is less tax- ing than that in Japan. \"They don't want to go back to Japan,\" she says. Her husband, too, is having to perfect his English the hard way. In his office of some 200 UU4t U_ . &U- h _ l sa ec s0 te ony JapOuane employee. Mrs Tomihara hopes to exploit her grasp of the English language more fully when she returns to work in a few years' time. Then she plans to use her experience to become a Japanese teacher for non-Japanese speakers. In order to integrate the fam- ily into British life, the Tomi- haras were loth to migrate to one of the two Japanese com- munities which now exist in London - in the Finchley area of north London, where the Japanese school was housed until 1987, and in the Acton/ Ealing area where the school was re-located in March that year. In this the Tomiharas are quite unusual. Estate agents in the Ealing and Acton areas have benefited from the move of the Japanese school. The west London branch of London-Tokyo Prop- erty Services has some 200 families on its books every year looking for accommoda- tion in the area, mainly for rental, says Mr Masahiro Sato. The school, which is- partly financed by the Japanese gov- ernment, has about 1,000 day pupils, ranging from seven to 15 years of age. All lessons are taught in Japanese and closely follow the curriculum taught in schools in Japan. Virtually all the students have at least one parent who is Japanese; most have two. The problem for estate \"It is hard to persuade Japanese families to take unmodernised English houses\" agents, says Mr Sato, is that many Japanese clients find English houses unacceptable. \"English houses are quite old, and if the landlord hasn't modernised them, especially the kitchen, bathroom and toi- let, it is difficult to persuade Japanese families to take them,\" he points out. \"If mod- ern facilities are missing, Japa- nese tenants can be fussy.\" They can also fuss about the costs. Mr Sato says the rental of a house in London can be twice that of one in Tokyo. Mrs Tomihara appears to have overcome such problems. But along with many London- ers, she bemoans the lack of an efficient transport system. \"When I was in Japan, if I wanted to go to Gina or Shin- juku (the main shoppnlag cen- tres) a train would come along every two or three minutes,\" she complains. The trains between Sutton and landaon are much less frke- quent, and she finds it particu- larly timeconsualg to have to travel from the centre of London to Harrow, Middlesex, a journey of some 20 miles a to visit old fiends and But there is one thing above all others that Mrs Tomihara misses about Japan, she says. That is the food. Dea Bradshaw",

   "text_content" : "THE Nissan car plant in Washington, Tyne and Wear is anything but a typical British manufacturlng site. Appear- ance and organisation, produc- tivity and links with supliers: all are fundamentally different. Prof Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff business school, and joint author of The Machine that Changed the World, a study of Japanese car produc- tion techniques, enthuses over the works. \"Here is real team- work, an enormous devolution of responsibility down to the work teams, and production methods which make visible immediately anything that goes wrong,\" he says. Mr Peter Wickens, Nissan's director of personnel, says there are four key elements. that top management learnt from the Japanese: an absolute commitment to quality at all levels within the business; the application of \"kaizen\" or the stress on continuous improve- ment throughout the produc- tion process; the ability to plan and analyse every action in detail; and the high level of engineering skill applie from- d =right through to fil Whatever the. most impor- tant factors, the nethods used are clearly different - and undeniably better - than those in UK plants. Prof Jones' book shows that the typical Japanese car is built in a frac- tion of the time of its US coun- terparts. But some commenta- tors are sceptical of the origins of the management techniques on display at Nissan and in other Japanese production facilities in the UK. \"I don't accept that what the Japanese do in Britain is what they do in Japan,\" says Prof lan Gow, director of the Scot- tish Centre for Japanese Studies at Stirling University. \"Their operations here have more in common with any greenfield site. What we are seeing is international manage- ment, British style, with a slight Japanese flavour.\" The London branches of Jap- anese financial Institutions and trading companies mirror their equivalents in Japan far more than any manufacturing operations, he argues. British staff may have elaborate titles and higih salaries, but are nor- mally excliidd from key deci- sion-making, which relies on continual exchange of Informa- tion - in Japanese. However, in manufacturing he believes the pattern is far less dear. Certain characteris- tics recur. a flexible workforce, for example, with employees who are willing to work on a variety of different tasks, may well not be unionised, and do not see a strong divide separat- ing them from their managers. Prof Gow says these are typical of all greenfield sites - those built from scratch - regard- less of the nationality of the parent company, and they reflect the best in current man- agement thinking. \"Greenfield sites liberate managers to do what they want, he says. They can select the best employees and arrange n asthey choI.o, rather than the lg acy of previous managers. What has been hyped over the past decade is partial Japanese The Briltish have more experience of solving problems - Japanese have fewer problems solutions. He criticises consul- tants who have \"worshipped at the shrine in Japan for three days\" and then returned to Britain to preach the latest fad. Most of this advice failed because it did not take account of the differences between Japan and the UK, such as the level of education, or the respect given to engineers. Others stress that much management practice casually referred to as Japanese comes ,*om other parts of thetworld the American influence Is strong in the emphasis on quality and employee involve- ment, for instance. Mr Wickens agrees with much of Prof Gow's argument. \"Nissan in Japan never sought to its style on us,\" he says. \"The senior British staff did what we thought was right for us. It is always extraordi- narily difficult to say what is Japanese. We apply those things which are generally good management and are u:- versal now.\" He says much of the stereotypical Japanese approach - lifetime employ- ment, consensus management, respect for seniority and so on - is very culturally-specific and cannot be transferred. He also argues that some aspects of production owe more to the Americans than the Japanese; that the British probably have more experience in solving problems than the Japanese (since problems are less common in the first place in Japan); and that enlightened management can bring about reform even on \"brownfeld\" or existing sites. Nevertheless, he stresses: \"Everyone now talks about quality, but the Japa- nese mean it. They have the control mechanisms to pursue it. They live and breathe qual- ity.\" Aside from the management approaches within the factory exemplifle4 by Nissan, one vital element less commonly discussed is the relationship between the manufacturer and its sub-contractors. It tends to be strong, intimate, long-term and often exclusive. Nissan even provides support through what it calls \"supplier develop- ment teams\". \"We work with sub-contrac- tors to improve their costs, capability and quality,\" says Mr Wickens. Next door to the Nissan plant stands Ikeda-Hoo- ver, a joint venture established in 1986 which supplies seats and interior car trim. The Nis- san factory represents more than 90 per cent of the com- pany's sales. \"We operate truly synchron- ised just-in-time production,\" says Mr Stewart Lang, manag- ing director. \"We have no stock. We use the specification from Nissan to drive produc- tion: a seat will be delivered to them three-and-a-half hours after it is ordered.\" That places pressure on the company to ensure that its suppliers in turn follow suit. \"There has to be a lot of education,\" he says. \"When we say we need some- thing at 4pm, we have to have it or else the customer will be making cars without seats.\" He says the vast majority of the company's own 70 suppli- ers have responded well, and Nissan has helped by sending in its development teams to advise on impovements in areas such as quality, produc- tivity, stock reduction and con- trol systems. Prof Jones estimates that the sub-contractors to Japanese manufacturing plants in the UK extend the number of com- panies within the sphere of influence of \"Japanese\" meth- ods to perhaps 250. However, he questions whether many practices have yet extended beyond the first tier of sub-con- tractors to their suppliers. \"The trickle down effect takes a while,\" he says. He is also sceptical of the insistence on labelling much manage- ment as Japanese. \"The system has become independent of its origins,\" he says. \"But this is a new era in the industry.\"",

   "text_content" : "English couple with an umbrella, 1860, one of a British Museum collection depicting westernere In Japan ............. CY.Ii'- WHEN, in the middle of the 19th century, Japan ended its self-imposed seclusion from the rest of the world the impact on the cultural life of the west was immediate and far rang- ing. European and American artists and collectors enthusi- astically responded to the prints, ceramics and the deco- rative arts generally that were now open for inspection. Things Japanese became all the rage, both for furnishings and as the inspiration of art. The influence of Japanese prints on the Impressionists is well recorded and the librettist W. S. Gilbert made much play with the British obsession with Japanese style. Not surprisingly, connois- seurs amassed collections of Japanese art, mainly prints and ceramics, but also lacquer, netsuke (carved wooden or ivory toggles attaching the inro purse to the kimono), and sword fittings, like tsuba (sword hilts). And today the British Museum and the Victo- ria & Albert have wonderful holdings of Japanese artefacts, deposited there by benefactors over the last century. With the Japanese business presence in the UK growing so visibly in the past two decades both museums have con structed new galleries to show off their Japanese collections The galleries were funded by Japanese companies and mark a profound improvement in the display of Japanese treasures in the UK, even though they are not nearly large enough to include more than a small pro- portion of the holdings of both museums. There are also fine groups of Japanese works of art in the main provincial cities - at the Ashmolean in Oxford, in Liver pool, Birmingham, even Maid stone, which is rich in ceram ics. Glasgow quickly developed links with Japan and was tak ing students from there as early as 1866. As part of the current Japan Festival, the Kelvingrove Art Gallery is showing wood and lacquer, musical instruments and fash ion accessories sent to the city in 1878 in exchange for Scot tish artefacts. It is indicative of the disregard for Japanese art which embraced most of the 20th century that these objects have rarely been displayed. But although the UK has a substantial stock of Japanese treasures it is starting to dawn on the current generation of museum specialists that the collections are not very repre- sentative and that they include few out-and-out masterpieces. The Japanese are very jeal- ous of their heritage and they allowed out very little of top quality. And such was the arrogance of the Victorians who first unlocked the country that they considered the Japa- nese art works of their own era to be of most interest, repre- senting the peak of the Japa- nese artistic achievement. They happily brought back later Edo ceramics, and other examples of the decorative arts, which the Japanese con- sidered to be in execrable taste but which they turned out as export goods for the west from the factories at Satsuma. We now realise that the greatest Japanese treasures are the early Buddhist sculptures, the medieval scrolls, the painted screens, the early swords, the objects created for the tea ceremony, all dating from the pre-Edo period, of the 16th century and earlier. The best examples of these have always been securely locked away in Japan and, even for the current festival in the UK, few are being allowed out on temporary loan. In this respect, the Americans showed better taste, and Boston's museums in particular have good exam- pies of medieval screens, early sculpture and ceremonial ware for tea drinking. Still, the British Museum has an excellent stock of Japa- nese paintings, and not exclu- sively from the 19th century. In recent years it has built up an exceptional group of 20th century Japanese paintings and prints. It is also quite rich A Japanese sculpture from the Kamakura period in rare Japanese archaeologi- cal remains. The V & A has the most important hoard of Japa- nese ceramics in Europe and, as early as 1877, was acquiring from Japan the artefacts linked to the tea ceremony. It is also rich in prints, and has fine col- lections of inro and netsuke. The Western interest in such objects as prints and netsuke, inro and tsuba, to say nothing of 19th century Japanese ceramics, has influenced the western orientated Japanese and they are starting to buy back artefacts that a genera- tion or more ago they would have considered to be of lim- ited artistic consequence. Prints, in particular, are now collected in Japan and it was significant that when Sothe- by's sold the important Amstutz collection earlier this year it auctioned it in Tokyo rather than in London or New York. Netsuke, tsuba, and especially lacquerwork are also attracting Japanese buyers. The Japan Festival provides opportunities for the British to view significant Japanese works of art which have been poorly represented in the UK. Most notable is the exhibition at the British Museum of the monumental wooden sculp- tures of the Kamakuyra period (1185-1333), including works by Unkei, the Michelangelo of Japan. The sculptures, made to adorn Buddhist temples, are decorated with paint, gold leaf and lacquer. They are the kind of treasures from Japan so notoriously overlooked by the Victorian connoisseurs. Of course, trade in art between the west and Japan has never been greater. In the past 10 years the Japanese have become by far the great- est collectors of Impressionist and modern art, and a Japa- nese collector paid the two highest prices for art at auc- tion in 1990 when Van Gogh's portrait of Dr Gachet fetched $82.5m and a Renoir $78.1m. In a quick cross-fertilisation the Japanese started painting in an Impressionist style around 1900 and artists such as Foujita were collected in the west. Now he is sought in his homeland as are other decora- tive early 20th century western artists such as Marie Lauren- cin and Chagall. The Japanese also buy contemporary artists such as de Kooning, but Old Masters and heavy antique European furniture and silver hold few attractions for them. For almost a century and a half there has been an extraor- dinary empathy between the west and Japanese art. Not just western appreciation of prints and porcelain but in pots, with Bernard Leach learning his craft in Japan and then inspir- ing Japanese potters, and in designs for fabrics and textiles. In the last few years, the Japa- nese have been more influ- enced by western, in particular by American, art, not least the movies. But the Japan Festival acts as a synthesis, filling in the gaps in western knowledge of Japanese culture and under- pinning the current two-way traffic in ideas and influences.",

They can travel at speeds of over 500 km/h - or twice as fast as conventional trains. And, because they skim over the rails, they generate no fric- tion.

   "text_content" : "ON THE day the Gulf War broke out earlier this year a marketing team from the Savoy Group of top London hotels flew to Tokyo to drum up new business. \"We could not have picked a worse time to go given what happened afterwards,\" admits Mr eter Bates, marketing director for the Savoy Group. \"But we believe it is an Important market for us and I think that making such efforts in difficult times pays divi- dends when the going gets bet- ter,\" he adds. Already there are signs that Japanese tourist arrivals are ecovering after the s aidi earlier tms year. Cladges hotel in central London, partof the Savoy Group, says that Japanese guests have increase by 2 per cent since June. Mr William Davis, chairman of the British Tourist Authority, also says that \"there are very encouraging signs that the Jap- anese market is recovering. By May this year the monthly out- bound travel total was exceed- ing the 1990 equivalent.\" Although Japanese tourists to the UK at present only rank 15th in the league table for incoming tourists to Britain, the BTA forecasts that they will become the second or third largest group of incoming tour- ists by the mid-1990s. \"We have no doubts that they will become a very big market for us,\" says Mr Davis. Japanese visitors at present are already high spenders. They spend an average of Â£75 per head, more than twice the world average and 50 per cent more than American tourists in Britain. The average spend per visit by Japanese is Â£488. Travel to Britain from Japan is spread evenly throughout the year, with only slight peaks occurring in February- March and again in July to September. Package tours are predominantly the main way that Japanese tourists see Britain. The Japanese, so British tourism officials believe, are more interested in visiting out of London places when they can link it to an English char- acter they have studied in school. Haworth in Yorkshire is, for example, gearing itself up to capitalise on Japanese interest in all things Bronte. It has just produced an 18-page booklet in Japanese to guide visitors through the sites made familiar through the Bronte siblings' novels. \"The Brontes are big in Japan and we now get a lot of Japanese visitors at Haworth,\" explains Mr David Parson, countryside officer for uterary pIIgfhinU japanese vkbfs d eekIx P01316 bp In Bradford Council. \"But their information is often totally inadequate to enjoy the coun- tryside round places like Top Withens, Penistone Crag, and Thrushcross Grange\" (all remote Brontl settings.) Getting Japanese visitors out of London, however, is a prob- lem for the tourist authorities. Some 90 per cent of Japanese visitors stay only in London, partly because of their limited touring time and partly because of the lack of market- ing of other tourist areas. The BTA, for example, is support- ing the efforts of the Five Ele- gant British Cities marketing consortium - Bath, Cardiff, Chester, Edinburgh and York - to woo more Japanese visi- tors. SOne concerted effort by the BTA over recent years has been to attract what it calls the \"office ladies\" from Japan - women with a high disposable income and more time than their male counterparts to spend on travel. Other target groups are about 10,000 English flanguage students and honey- mooners: some 97 per cent of all Japanese couples honey- moon overseas. Britain, so tourist officials believe, has a strong image with Japanese who are inter- ested in British culture and .heritage. But they are also aware that Japanese visitors expect a high standard of facili- ties and service and appreciate dealing with Japanese speak- ing staff. The Savoy Group, for exam- ple, has for the past two years arranged exchanges with reception staff from the Okura Hotel in Tokyo. And every two months the Savoy's training department holds special Japa- nese culture courses. Staff are told, for example, not to book Japanese clients into a room that has a \"4\" in its number as this is considered bad luck. Forte hotels, the UK's largest hotel chain, has maintained a sales office in Japan for the past 18 years: it was, in fact, the first European hotel group. to operate such an office in Tokyo and had an inauspicious start with just Â£500 worth of business in the first three months. Now the office pro- vides significant business. Hotels are not alone in wooing the Japanese visitors: British retail stores have also realised the potential. The Self- ridges department store, for example, operates a Japan Bureau within the central Lon- don store and offers store guides in Japanese, shopping consultants, and door-to-door shipping facilities. But encouraging Japanese tourists to come to Britain sometimes needs a novel approach. The Beatrix Potter character Peter Rabbit, for example, is proving a major attraction with the Japanese. Mr Tim Bartlett, BTA's general manager for the Asia region, says that \"the Japanese have never heard of the Lake Dis- trict but, as they seemed to know all about Peter Rabbit, we advertised the lakes as 'Peter Rabbit's Country'\".

   "text_content" : "EVER since the first adventurers brought bhck tales of the wonders of the Orient, the BritIsh have been fascinated by things ds a different. Nc, Japan his coms to the West ''Though this autumn's big festival is clearly aitemporaryand time-limited exercise, there are several Japanese enterprises that have been testing the water for some time and are now clearly here to stay. Anybody who has ever been to Tokyo will remember the department stores - for the high prices, of course, but also for the old-world courtesy, the stunningly high quality of the displays, the food and the merchandise. Here in Britain, some of their grandest department stores have outposts in some of London's most fashionable shopping streets - in Lower Regent Street there is Mitsukoshi, in Davies Street there is Takashimaya and half way up New Bond Street there is Isetun. All are big names in Japan but, with their rails of Burberrys and cashmeres and their emphasis on designer label luxury goods, their London stores are aimed more at the Japanese tourist abroad than the British shopper out for for a taste of old Japan. For authentic Japanese nick-nacks and inexpensive trinkets Mitsukiku has long been the place to go - for ceramic rice bowls, the traditional fish dishes, simple blue and white kimonos and happi coats, sandals and incense. For a flavour of modern Japan and some authentic Japanese merchandise one of the best places for the keen shopper is Muji at 26 Great Marlborough Street, London Wl. New on the scene but already a huge success, it offers simple, understated, unbranded goods - from vests, T-shirts and simple linen suits to filing boxes, snack foods, glasses, ceramic bowls. For a whiff of ancient arts and crafts drop into Neal Street East, 5 Neal Street, London WC2 where there will be woven fabrics using the traditional indigo dyes and patterns and made up into kimonos, Jackets and workmen's trousers. The outstanding bookstore for those looking for current newspaper, magazines and books is Books Nippon at 64 - 66 St. Paul's Churchyard, London EC4. Even those unable to read Japanese will find some charming authentic presents - such as wrapping paper and traditional dolls, masks and fans. Japanese food may be an acquired taste but once addicted it's a habit that's hard to break. Light, delicious and wonderfully unfattening, it's hard for the Westerner to reproduce at home but those who want to give it a whirl will need the authentic ingredients. They are available at JA Centre, 348-356 Regent's Park Road, London N3 and Yoshino, 15-16 Monkville Parade, Finchley Road, London NW11. Both sell almost everything from the Part of tw winter colletion of Waey Mlyake, one of Japan's top dealgnrs sauces and flavourings to the noodles, the rice crackers, the beers and the raw fish. If you only have time to visit one place I would have to recommend Liberty of Regent Street. As befits its roots - Liberty started life with packing-cases full of Eastern goodies - it is taking the festival extremely seriously and is bringing to Britain a gaggle of names, designers and ranges never before seen over here. Apart from the fashion departments which will have Issey Miyake ranges and collections by Yuki Torii and Osamu Maede, look out for the bed linen from Al-Jabr - utterly, utterly different from anything we have here - the fascinatingly avant garde furniture from Kenji Kobayashi. The Japanese are renowned for innovative textiles and Nuno's amazingly innovative high-tech fabrics designed by Junichi Aral are so beautiful that you will long to find ways of using them. Some can just be draped as they are, others can be made up into anything from some dashing curtains to avant sarde jackets. When it comes to fashion, Jan leads the world - labels like IsseyM YolhjiYamamoto and CommedesGarons are recognised the world-over as offering the most creative, innovative fashion vision anywhere. Ali ae exclusive labels, all are ver highly priced (any real fan who fInds herself in Japan should make a point of buying there where the prices, naturally, are very much cheaper) but for your money you get what in fashion terms are almost works of art. All have ranges for men as well as women, all have rather daunting flag-ship shops - all minimalist decor and alarmingly chic assistants; but persevere and you see what the labels mean. Issey Miyake is at 270 Brompton Road, London SW3, where his men's, women's and Permanente (a sort of all time Golden Oldie range) lines are sold but a less expensive line, Plantation is to be found at 29 Smith Street, London SW3. Yolji Yamamoto is at 165 Sloane Street, and Commes des Garcons at 59 Brook Street, London Wi. Another name to look out for is Matsuda - the same emphasis on strong, sculptural shapes that make Japanese fashion so distinctive and the same interest in innovative fabrics make these wonderfully original clothes eminently desirable. Now Toklo at 309 Brompton Road, London SW3 has added the Matsuda label to those of Tokio Kumagal (most famous for his shoes) and AT Atsuro Tayama. Though the image of Japan here is all exquisite taste, cultural refinement and advanced gizmos, anybody who has ever been to Tokyo and spent a Sunday morning wandering round that corner of Tokyo known as Harajuku will know that there is another side to Japan. At Harajuku, the Sunday parade is every bit as rebellious and extraordinary as anything London's King's Road has to offer. There the rebellious young seem to join hands with their peer groups around the world and show themselves able to match the rest of the world when it comes to being outrageous. Refined and commercialised versions of this alternative fashion have just arrived over here under the World Wide Freaks label The brainchild of the designer Fujiko Nakajima, the clothes show the vitality and panache of a Japanese Vivien Westwood - the young should love them. There are lots of denim jackets and bustiers, satin bomber jackets and shorts in leopard prints or shiny vinyL For older women she also offers surprisingly ladylike jackets but all with a little something extra about them. For the moment the range can only be seen at Academy Soho, 15 Newburgh Street, London W1V 1 LS.",
