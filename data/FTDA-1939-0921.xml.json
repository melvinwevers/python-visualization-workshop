WEDNESDAY Evening. A check to the precipitate advance in silver prices and the early steadiness of sterling in New York were the main features in Money market circles to- day. Demand for silver was less pro- nounced and turnover was very modest. Official exchange rates in London were again practically unchanged. Lombard Street continued on the even tenor of its way and there was an open mind on the possibility of a reduction in Bank Rate to-morrow. Demand for bills was once more in evidence, with the clear ing banks holding on their rates for Octo- ber, November and December dates. These maturities they were prepared to take at 3, 3% and 3% per cent., respectively. Outside inquiry for the \" hot \" Treasury bill was reported at 3% per cent., but as was the case with other paper, business was small owing to the reluctance of holders to sell. Most of the leading houses quoted 3\" per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts, but the best quality paper could be placed at 3%s per cent. Credit supplies were said to be still com- sortable, borrowers being able to satisfy their requirements in non-clearing quarters at under 3 per cent. LuANs DISCOVNT 'PER CENT.

There was some abatement in the speculative rush to buy silver to-day and with bear covering also less pronounced prices were only %.d better at 23,d per ounce for cash and 230ifd per ounce for forward delivery. Leading brokers believed the lull in price increases is only temporary. Foreign Exchanges A fair amount of business was reported in the foreign exchange market to-day and, as far as could be judged, offerings of foreign currencies were still in excess of demand. The U.S. dollar quotation was maintained at $4.03 middle and that for the Canadian dollar at $4.45. Dutch guilders hardened 5 points to 7.52, as did Norwegian kroner to 17.60, while Swiss francs gained 10 centimes at 17.65. The Argentine peso improved to 17.10.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 20th Sept. The Stock Market opened strong and active, but turned lower on profit-taking, and closed easy, with prices mostly fractionally to 1 point either way. Turn- over totalled 2,140,000 shares, against 1,830,000 yesterday. Opposition to the recent bullish trend came from the more cautious operators who, while agreeing that the British and French answers to Herr Hitler held out no hope of a short war, decided to take their profits pending developments in connection with the domestic squabble over the Neutrality Bill which comes before Congress to-morrow. Many substantial blocks of shares changed hands at higher prices after a firm opening. But after the early rush of buying orders had spent itself, the market quietened and profit-taking re- duced initial gains. Nevertheless, gains up to 1 point were recorded over a wide list at midday, while Steels advanced anything up to $2. Prices eased in places in the early afternoon, but the majority of the list remained upward and Steels and Aircrafts advanced, the former being assisted by a further rise of $1 per ton in the price of heavy steel melting scrap at Pittsburgh and the continued expansion in output. Motors and Chemicals moved narrowly and Oils were inclined to ease. Railway stocks were helped by an estimate that this week's level of car-loadings will show a good rise to 805,000 cars. Towards the finish trading turned dull as realising continued, and the closing trend was easy. i f t i t i s 1 1 i i f I t 1 t r 1 IÂ·__ 1^Â·Â·Â· 1___1_ I-Â·~Â·Â·Â·-~~Â·Â·~IÂ·1 ~l^Â·-iÂ·-Â·- mne Iow-Jones industrials closing aver- age rose .11 to 152.25 and Rails .26 to 32.45, while Utilities declined .32 to 24.42. Dealings covered 909 stocks, of which 470 were higher, 258 declined and 181 were unaltered. In the Bond market U.S. Governments were easy and Railroads strong; bond sales amounted to $13,420,000. Moody's commodity daily index (31st December, 1931 = 100) was 171.1, against 169.2 yesterday. Westinghouse Electric's August net earnings estimated at $835,000 (July $774,000). Kansas City and Southern Railroad August net income $238,000 (July, $261,000). Southern Pacific net loss for 7 months to 31st July, after prior charges, $2,056,000 (loss $11,612,000). August net income $2,595,000 (July $2,353,000). Production of electricity for the week ended 16th September totalled 2,444,000,000 kilowatt hours-an increase of 10.4 per cent. over the corresponding week of last year, according to the Edison Electric Institute, and a new high record.

   "article_dc_title" : "Reasonable Firmness",
   "text_content" : "To-day's postponed Settlement of th: 7th September Account is regardee with no particular anxiety, as i: evidenced by the reasonable firmness yesterday of most equities. There were special explanations foi a few marked declines. Mid-October Account There was apparently no furthei selling yesterday in connection witii to-day's Settlement. But I heard ii suggested that the 12th Octobei Account may prove more troublesomn in the case of a number of contangc positions which have been temporarily extended. It is presumed that fresh Making-ul prices will be fixed for the mid-Octobei Account. If these are anywhere neaw current quotations some disastrous differences will be disclosed. For example, on the 31st August basis Imperial Tobaccos have made u; for to-day's Settlement at Â£6 10s, whereas the units now stand at only Â£5 2s 6d. There is not likely to be much, if any, Carry-Over in Imps. But ol speculative shares West Wits. and Western Holdings may be taken as ex- treme cases. The former have made ui at Â£4. against to-day's Â£2 12s 6d, and the latter at 7s 9d, against 13s 3d. Immobilised Gilt-edged Criticism, even some complaint, is still heard in other departments of the House that there has been practically a moratorium in gilt-edged stocks since the outbreak of war, whereas dealers in equities have been expected and virtually forced to bear the heat and burden of the day. Operators for the Account have been pressed not only to settle up pre-war positions, but dealers have had to absorb necessitous sales of Industrials, etc., by investors unable to sell gilt edged stocks. In 1914 a general mora torium was proclaimed and ample time was allowed for the arrangement of embarrassed positions. The problem then was infinitely larger than now, but that is no consolation to individual victims of current conditions. Much at Stake In the Consol market itself I could find no encouragement yesterday for the contention heard elsewhere that minimum prices should be abolished or materially reduced. Too much is at stake for hasty action to be wise. Confidence in the banking and insur ance structure and a vast number of loans thirouigliniti the cointry ir'iepniÃ½nc upon gilt-edged stocks. As things are a persistent trickle of sales in a free market might have an exaggerated effect on prices. I am told that one firm alone has a queue on its books of some 500 would-be sellers of War Loan. After the War Budget and an official declaration of Bank Rate and monetary policy, then the time may be ripe for an attempt to thaw the gilt- edged market. The small owner of gilt-edged stocks through the Post Office is seemingly still entitled to have his holding ex- changed for cash at the minimum price ruling. Other investors ought to have no difficulty in obtaining moderate tem- porary loans from their banks on any British Government stock. ullx Siartfilt",

   "text_content" : "WEDNESDAY Evening. Stock Exchange activity failed t( expand perceptibly to-day, but mar kets maintained the better tendenc3 evident at yesterday's close. Sellinj in advance of to-morrow's Settlemen had evidently been completed, anc signs of bargain hunting were re ported in some sections. Although business was still impedec by the jam in the gilt-edged marke' resulting from minimum prices, thi extent of this week's falls in othei sections helped to increase the resist ance of markets generally. It is anti. cipated that to-morrow's Settlemeni will be completed smoothly. To-day's markings in all sections totalled 2,176, against 2,104 yesterday. Negotiation of business in gilt-edgei securities remained as difficult as ever. Nc further news was available in the markei regarding adjustment of minimum quota- tions, although the present unsatisfactor3 position continues to engage the attentior of the authorities. Transactions marked were again at anm within a fraction of the minima, War Loar changing hands at from 88% to 88% anm deals in Four and a-Half per Cent. Con- version ranging from the fixed price ol 100% up to 101. It was reported, how- ever, that a small line of the latter stocl had been taken by the market during thc day at a figure slightly above the mini- mum level. Business in India Loans and Dominiou and Corporation stocks was equally quiet Recorded transactions were in practicall3 all cases close to the fixed prices. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 CHILEANS SUPPORTED The Foreign bond market continued dul despite the slight improvement in senti ment in other parts of the House. Th: volume of business was very small anm with few exceptions prices moved down- wards where they moved at all. Chilean 4% per cent. 1886 met with a little support and added % at 13. Else. where Japanese 6 per cent. 1924 recoverec a fraction of the losses sustained early ir the week with a gain of 1 point to 37. Losses were nowhere large and indi- cated market idleness rather than selling pressure. Argentine 3% per cent. showed one of the larger movements at 62, as com- pared with 64 overnight. Chinese bonds continued weak and in some cases lost a further point. Belgian 4 per cent. 193E were sold in small quantity and dropped 1 point to 65. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 IMPROVEMENT IN RAILS Pressure on the Home Rail market eased considerably and the small sellers of the past week were replaced by small buyers, It-was-anrnathe less difficult to- dispose- o a large line of stock and in the case of some of the more popular prior charges brokers reported the existence of a wait ing list. L.M.S. 4 per cent. Preference were again one of the most active stock. in a thin market, and a number of deals were marked close above the minimum price of 48. Ordinary stocks reflected a stronger tone in fractional gains at the close. Great Western were % to the good at 23 and L.M.S. made headway to 11. Among Foreign Rails the news that the Brazilian Government has sanctioned an increase in rates by the San Paulo com- pany attracted attention to the stock, which closed firmly 1 point to the good at 25%. Rumours of similar develop- inents impending in the case of Antofa gasta led to some inquiry, but the stock closed unchanged at 9. The Argentine group lacked the guid- ance of traffics, following the removal of the offices of the companies to the country. It is expected that figures will be published to-day. B.A.G.S. passed a quiet session and closed unchanged, but Central Argentine found a little buying support and advanced % to 7%. New York Central were again the most active feature in the American list and followed Wall Street's overnight strength with a gain of 2% to 24. Pennsylvania also changed hands in London and added 2% points to close at 29. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS IRREGULAR Several Finish Below Best, but Minor Gains Shown Following upon yesterday's improve- ment in tone, some of the leading Indus- trials to-day showed a firmer tendency, but, owing to lack of support, prices again in places turned easier towards the finish. On the whole, there was little business passing but brokers reported some tenta- tive inquiry for stock and this tended to offset the effect of further small selling. Inquiries received for Brewery shares suggested that averaging was in progress after the late shake-out, while the low levels to which Tobacco shares have fallen also attracted a few buyers. While irregularity marked the course of prices the final quotations revealed quite a number of moderate rallies. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 83.8, against 83.4. BANKING shares, while still irregular, showed some improvement, notably in Westminsters, where a recovery of 78 6d to 60s was recorded. National Provincial :\" B \" gained 3s to 47s 6d and Lloyds 2s 6d to 42s 6d. On the cut in dividend Bank of Scotland shares fell 10s to 60s and in sympathy Royal of Scotland fell 10 points to 415. Bank of British West Africa were down 6s to 50s and Hongkong and Shanghai 2 isints to 73. In the INSURANCE group, Hearl and Londons were each % better; ather changes were adverse, with Prudential \" A \" down 1 to 20%. A steadier tendency developed among ELECTRIC POWER issues on the belief that the recent liquidation had ended. Metro- nnilitann r'lired i firn to 7a Rd andr Mid. land Counties 6d to 32s. County of London Electrics were dealt in up to 29s 3d. English Electrics fell Is to 26s on re- sumed selling. Other ELECTRICAL EQUIP- MENTS were steady. G.E.C. changed between 63s 6d and 65s and Ever Ready from 22s to 22s 9d. Sellers of MOTOR shares found prices moving sharply against them. Buyers are holding aloof from this market on the idea that some companies, now engaged largely on war work, will not distribute dividends commensurate with present prices. Morris were 3s down at 23s 3d and Austins 2s 6d lower at 17s 6d, with the \"A\" shares 16s 3d. On the other hand, Albions, Dennis, Leylands and, Fords improved. Raleigh Holdings rallied to 45s. Leading AIRCRAFTS turned firmer and Hawker Siddeleys rallied Is 1Yd to 10s 6d, thus regaining yesterday's loss. to re '1 .i! el id et ii el 1- ir t. ;i- Il is -d Tc el a- -Y In Id in id n- of v- :1 1i- In sit ly [i- Id in a e- in 5i- Ig id t- Is a se id g id s. ?s t- !e [s Is a t- *e Id te Id ie I- 11 a It ;t d h a d n i. s a v f Ea a I 1 fc Among COMPONENTS, Dunlops were 24s, after changing at 23s 6d. Triplex Glass were mentioned at 23s 9d. SHIPPING issues again pursued a down- ward course. Coast Lines were Is 3d weaker at 11s 6d and P. and 0. Deferred Is to 20s. IRON and STEEL issues were without a definite tendency. Babcock and Wilcox attracted some support and rallied Is 3d to 42s 6d. United Steels further firmed up to 20s 3d on the dividend and minor gains were secured by John Browns, Colvilles, Dorman Long, Baldwins and Consetts. B.S.A. and Stantons were lower. Tube Investments were 2s 6d down at 70s. Imperial Chemicals rose 6d to 26s 9d in advance of the dividend. TEXTILES lacked attention and English Sewing Cottons were lowered Is 6d to 23s 9d. Coats were rather sellers at 24s and Fine Spinners Preference fell 9d to 8s 9d. Changes were unimportant in RAYONS. Courtaulds and Celanese were without quotable change. American and Canadian Celanese were firmer. Wool- worths at 51s 3d were lower among STORES. Boots Drug rallied to 39s 6d. Provision Stores generally were steady. For reasons that did not transpire, Tate and Lyle were weak, selling down to 52s, but going better later. Helped by inquiries for cheap stock, BREWERY issues picked up and Charring- tons were 5s higher at 50s, while Mitchells and Butler gained 3s 9d to 57s 6d. Ind Coope, Watney Deferred, Benskins and South African Breweries were Is to Is 3d better. Distillers were up Is to 81s 6d on a fair demand. Meux were weak at 20s. TOBAccOS maintained their late firm- ness. British American and Imperials were each % better. CINEMAS shares were inclined to turn firmer. Further recessions occurred in the NEWSPAPER group. American Industrials showed an im- proving tendency. Bethlehems touched 113, U.S. Steels 92/;, Nickels 53, Chryslers 105, General Motors 64Y4 and American Woolworth 49. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS LACK SUPPORT With rubber showing a downward trend, the share market had another quiet ses- sion. Except in one or two instances sup- port was lacking, and though offering was light quotations eased. Dusun Durian were rather offered and lost Is 3d at 12s 6d. Kuala Mudas fell the same amount at 8s 9d. Sungei Krian left off at 25s, against 26s 3d yesterday. Telogoredjo debentures weakened 4 to 115. On the other hand. Lumut rose from 16s 7Yd to 16s 10%d. The leading issues were mainly firm, Rubber Trust being harder at 27s 6d. Mincing Lane Stock Exchange was dull, although there was a little more activity than usual. Quotations eased. Business passed in Hevea Johore at Is, Sungei Krian 25s, Vallambrosa 7s 3d and United Sua Betong 46s 3d. Stock Exchange prices for Tea shares were mainly easier. Nuwara Eliya were an exception; they advanced from 31s 10'd to 32s 6d. Jas. Finlay were sold from the North and lost Is 3d at 43s 1%d. Rubber and Tea Prices Page 4 RISES AMONG OILS Rises predominated in the Oil market, although the general tone was somewhat uncertain throughout the session and a definitely easier tendency developed in places towards the close. Shells met with a little support, thought to be of an investment nature, and closed %e to the good at 4'%1,, after 4Y2. Royal .Dutch were in renewed demand and at 40, rather buyers, recovered yesterday's loss of a point. Following their overnight rise in New York, Shell Union were marked up 1% to 18. Trinidad issues were firm, without any notable improvement, but a good feature was provided by Kerns, which went ahead 7'4d to 4s 4Y4d. Figures published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES last Thursday showed the company to have increased its produc- tion in California during August. Mexican Eagles rallied 3d to 5s, while Canadians kept at 8s 9d. Anglo-Ecua- dorians recovered 6d to 19s. Oil Share Prices Page 4 SOME MINES ADVANCE Sallies Improve-Rhodesian Coppers and Barriers Up Dealers in Mining shares had less selling to cope with. As a result, the market generally retained the steadier tendency that was becoming apparent towards the close yesterday afternoon. This improved tone in turn proved sufficient to attract a few cheap buyers. The demand was selective and rarely more than small in amount, but it was enough to cause a scattering of price gains on the day. In Kaffirs buyers mainly confined their attention to the shares of producing mines. Sallies rallied % to 3%., and a number of issues, including Brakpan, Vogels., Rose Deep and Robinson Deep \" B,\" improved 4%. Of the non-producers, Venterspost reacted '/ to 1'%,, after 1%. offered, and in the Finance group some selling pressure put Gold Fields down '/. to 2. Anglo- American, Rand Selection and 'Consoli- dated Mines Selection hardened. Rather unaccountably, West Africans remained lifeless, with the few changes again downwards. Ashanti sagged %/ to YA., despite the excellent reef value of 51.2 dwts over 21 ft encountered on the lowest level of the mine last month. Bibiani at 26s and Ariston at 10s 3d eased Id apiece. Of other Gold shares, Oriental Consolidated were again something of a feature with a further rise to 2% rather buyers, Among Australians, Wiluna lardened 3d to 7s 6d. Rhodesian Coppers improved a trifle, but were inclined to finish slightly under -he best. Rhokana put on % to 12%. Rises if 3d occurred in Roan, Rhodesian Selection and Selection Trust. Chartered Iropped 9d to 19s and Wankie Colliery 6d o 15s 6d. Among Leaa-Zincs, better prices for the Barriers were cabled from Australia, which imparted firmness to the London market. Zinc Ordinary rose % to 3%, North Broken Hill '/to to 2, Props. A.a to 2%., South 3d to 21s 6d and New Broken Hill 6d to 13s 6d. Tin shares kept firm, but business was not enough to cause many changes. In fact, the two chief movements were down- wards, consisting of %a declines in Southern Malayan to 1%. and Mawchi to 1%9,. In the Diamond group, Anglo-American Trust were called %. better at %\"/ and Consolidated of South-West Africa Ordinary 3d higher'at 2s 9d. XMJI --.- C'D--- AD: Â« Â» Â«",

   "text_content" : "There will be a gathering of the clans this morning in the Consol market of the Stock Exchange at about 10 minutes to 12, to hear whether the Government broker will have anything to say concerning Bank Rate. When no change is made, this is merely signalled in the indicators. When an alteration occurs, it is announced by the Govern- ment broker, and the indicators are immediately illuminated with the new figure. The Trans-Lux is not used on such occasions. The indicators have been in use for many years. On the pre-war nights when the House acted as a City host, visitors were taken for a stroll round the Stock Exchange after dinner and, among other objects of interest, the indicators entertained the guests with rapid transitions in the Bank Rate which, if they had been serious, would have thrown the financial world into convulsive fits. Worth Selling Our hint the other day that Midland Counties Three and a-Half per Cent. debenture should be sold while the going is good, resulted in some of the holders taking advantage of the sugges- tion. The market is still short of stock, and at 90 the holder of this security should certainly sell it, in view of the prices of other similar securities which do not happen to be in request. The Seller's Chance The Three and a-Quarter per Cent. debenture stocks of the Midland Elec- tric Corporation, London Power, North Eastern Electric, are saleable, in modest amounts, at 80, and they should be turned out while possible. So also should Gloucestershire Power Four per Cent. debenture, for which the com- paratively high price of 97 is bid. Were it not for the market position in these particular stocks, the quota- tions would be nearer 70 than 80. Unless the war is coming to an end very quickly, and unless any of these stocks happen to be shortly redeemable at par, the prices I have mentioned are fully- valued and the holder should let them go. The security in each case is first- rate, but the prices, relatively speaking, stand too high. Ooregum's Pleasant Surprise Declaration of a sixpenny interim dividend on Ooregum Ordinary comes as a pleasant surprise, for the company has paid no interim dividend for years. If this 6d should be followed by an equal amount (or possibly 9d) as a final dividend, the present price of 10s would make the Ordinary look cheap because of the way in which profits are going ahead. Nundydroogs recently went ex 2s in- terim dividend. The shares received 4s 9d for the whole of last year, and, were this to be cut even to 4s, the shares at the present price of 29s would give the handsome return. of 133 per cent. Champion Reef and Mysore The Champion Reef dividend of Is 9d is the same as that of a year ago. The company is expected to pay 4s for the year. The shares stand at 42s. The Mysore repeats the dividend of 9d as before. It will probably be made up to 2s 9d for the full year. At 28s, to-day's price, the yield on this basis would be 10 per cent. Autlartus",

   "article_dc_title" : "Looking after Exports",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Of all the branches of civil activity which demand unremitting attention iii spite of the war, British export trade calls most insistently for support. The requirements of the Services in muni- tions and equipment are of paramount importance, but they can be supplied only if the country can command the necessary resources in gold and foreign currencies to pay for the basic raw materials and other products which must be imported. The facts are recog nised by the Government. In the early days of the war the President of the Board of Trade stressed in Parliament the \" vital importance \" attached to the maintenance of the export trade and the high priority which should be given to exports among the various demands on the country's economic resources. Excellent in theory, those views must be translated into practice to be of use to the nation in this time of crisis. For this purpose, we need both effec- tive co-ordination of Government activities and the close co-operation of industry. In the latter respect the Federation of British Industries is already justifying its decision to \" carry on\" during the war, and its plan for meeting export orders, to which reference was made in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, should give valuable help in securing business which otherwise would go to our rivals abroad. The idea is that an undertaking receiving foreign orders which it is unable to execute shall pass them on, through machinery which has been set up, to another trader who is in a posi- tion to cope with them. This will call for the greatest good will and the sink- ing, for the time being, of trade rivalries. Given these requisites, there is no reason why it should not be made to work efficiently. The material sacri- fices involved should be small, since the basis of the plan, presumably, is that a manufacturer passing on orders would already be working to capacity, but such as have to be made would be well worth while in the national interest. On the other side there must be assurance of supplies of materials, of labour and of finance. The first two categories become a Government re- sponsibility to a great extent in view of the institution of various controls. Unless industry is safeguarded in those respects, it will be almost impossible in some cases to live up to the declared intention of conforming to our current trade pacts, but labour and materials together can only produce the goods required in contact with one reagent- finance. What is the present position of the export credit schemes? In view of the attitude of the Board of Trade throughout, it must be assumed that the utmost help practicable in present circumstances will be given, but since uncertainty has been expressed in trading quarters, an authoritative state- ment of the Government's intentions is desirable. It is alleged, too, that some of the banks are not as helpful as they might be in regard to finance even for transactions guaranteed under the ex- port credits scheme. If there are no circumstances peculiar to the traders concerned, such treatment would be contrary to the spirit of the Govern- ment's declaration that the export trade is vital. The attitude of the banks must be governed by the tenets of sound practice, but within their limits liberality should be the watchword.",

For last year this was followed by a final payment re- duced from 51 to 5 per cent. The present decision is in accordance with the expressed desire to maintain a steady dividend policy lying within narrow limits through good years and bad. To that end the Board has en- deavoured to make the company so strong that its stability would remain unimpaired by even a major trade depression. Maintenance of the interim suggests that the trading outlook is not un- satisfactory. A company with the world-wide ramifications of I.C.I. could not hope entirely to escape the effects of war conditions, but what it may lose in certain directions abroad may well be made up in the home field. A variety of markets exists for a wide diversifi- cation of products successfully backed by a progressive manufacturing and trading policy.",

The latter showed a fall of Â£27,500 in net profits, to Â£527,400, and the move- ment of the trading figure, including dividends from subsidiaries, and after taxation, is very similar in dimensions. The report emphasises the onerous nature of the tax burden, and reveals that the amount reserved for N.D.C. alone in the accounts of the parent and allied companies is no less than Â£50,000. It may well be that the heavier demands of taxation account for the whole of the latest recession in earnings. The company's trading net is spread wide, and good provincial sales must have done much to offset the decline experienced by a London business such as Harvey Nichols. The balance- sheet total is some Â£200,000 down at Â£12,170,200, accounted for largely by the lower figures for creditors on the one side and for property, stocks and debtors on the other. The content of the stocks item is, of course, more important than ever at a time like the present.

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Early advices from New York yester- day indicated that sterling was steadiei in that centre. One or two dealers re- ported more offerings of dollars in con- nection with the closing of speculative commitments. Despite the rather wide movementi in the sterling-dollar quotation in New York there is still no evidence tc suggest that black market dealings in America, or any other foreign centre, have attained appreciable volume. As far as the London exchange market was concerned, dealers reported quite an active day with offerings of foreign currencies still satisfactory. Mixed Decisions In the meantime, authorised and un- authorised dealers continue to be over burdened with knotty problems and divided views on identical matters. There is conflict among departments. One example will illustrate this. A certain authorised dealer, prepared to grant permission for foreign exchange desired for ship's disbursements-port dues, etc.-called for particulars as to the ship, destination and so on. This information was required to comply with the Defence Regulations as they apply to foreign exchange. The applicant, however, was com- pelled to point out that if he supplied the information it would contravene Board of Trade regulations. The point is, who gives way and how? It is also understood that certain authorised banks, because of their in- timate knowledge of their customer, have refused to provide exchange but, on referring the matter to the authori- ties, have been amazed to find the de- cision given in favour of the applicant. Chilean Exchange The sudden appreciation in the Chilean dollar in London on Tuesday occasioned no surprise seeing that the basic exchange rate in Chile remains at 25 pesos per U.S. dollar, with ster- ling fluctuating on the New York- London cross-rate. In usually well-informed circles it is thought piobable that Chile's \" compen- sation \" treaties with Germany and other countries will now be cancelled and that Chile will demand payment for her produce in currencies of free inter- national value. As concerns Brazil, the \"free\" rate for imports remains steady on New York, but since the official support for the Â£ was withdrawn in London the corresponding rate for sterling imports has fallen sharply.",

In the light of these observations by Mr. W. J. Chinneck, who presided at yesterday's meeting in the absence of Mr. A. P.

It is too soon to judge what the effect of war may be on profits, but if any- thing approaching last year's resul+s are obtained shareholders will have cause for satisfaction.

The outlook, as measured by the 50 per cent. rise in sales for th: first two months of the current year, should provide encouraging reading foi the shareholders. As was to be expected, the company has switched over from civilian ti Government contracting and has been impelled to hold up its drop forgings for private cars.

   "text_content" : "S ro om auC mlUrn IOr August show a not unexpected rise in imports, reflecting the need for an enlargement of the nation's commodity supplies in view of the then-impending war. Compared with August, 1938, the import increase amounts to Â£6,984,000. The greatest advance is shown in manufactures-presumably connected with rearmament-which are Â£5,620,000 up at Â£23,633,000. Food, drink and tobacco imports are slightly lower, though there is a rise of over Â£2 millions in raw material purchases from abroad. Exports, on the other hand, are no more than Â£746,000 higher at Â£37,077,000, while re-exports show a decrease. Thus the August import surplus amounts to Â£39,532,000, or Â£6,794,000 more than a year ago. The corresponding deficit in the visible trade balance for the first eight months is Â£256,091,000, or Â£11,193,000 less than in 1938. The rate of imports is certain to increase in a rapid fashion from now on, which means that every effort must be made to meet the cost by a drive for export production. Needless to say, the elimination of German competition from many overseas markets, combined with the diffusion of Allied war-expen- diture among the primary producing countries, will create many openings for British exporters-provided they can produce the goods.",

As we have explained on several occasions, the weakness of the shares is to a considerable extent due to what aniounts to forced sell- ing owing to the inability of investors to realise gilt-edged stocks at existing mini- nium prices. The consequence has been that high-class Industrials and other marketable securities have had to be sold. Zinc - \" The Diarist \" writes: 1. Keep Imperial Smeltiing.

   "text_content" : "Preliminary figures for Great Britain's overseas trade last month show a 9.4 per cent. increase in the value of imports (to Â£81,097,000) as compared with August, 1938. This was accompanied by a 2.1 per cent. rise in exports to Â£37,077,000 and a decrease of 11 per cent. in re-exports to Â£4,488,000. Adverse balance thus advanced by Â£6,794,000 to Â£39,532,000. For the first eight months of the year imports are down by Â£10,507,000 (1.1 per cent.), exports up by Â£6,733,000 (2.1 per cent.) and re-exports down by Â£6,047,000 (14.3 per cent.). Comparative Board of Trade figures are appended:- Aug., 1939 (Â£000's) (Â£000's) Imports ............ . 81,097 +6,984 Exports ............ 37,077 + 746 Re-exports ............ 4,488 - 556 Total exports ......... 41,565 + 190 Adverse balance ...... 39,532 +6,794 Jan.-Aug., 1939 (Â£000's) (Â£000's) 606,032 -10,507 313,637 + 6,733 36,304 - 6,047 349,941 + 686 256,091 -11,193 AaIIverse naianc ...... 6v,o6' The rise in imports last month to a total exceeded only once during the past year (in June) was due princi- pally to manufactured goods. the value of which was Â£23,633,000, against Â£18,013,000 in August, 1938. Raw materials were invoiced at Â£22,633,000. as compared with Â£20,314,000, but there was a slight fall in the value of foodstuffs and tobacco -from Â£35,087,000 to Â£34,597,000. MANUFACTURED GOODS Shipments Higher Exports, though slightly improved by comparison with those in August, 1938,. were Â£3,278,000 down on July and the lowest for any month this year except May. The value of manufac- tures exported reached Â£28,544,000-' Â£499,000 above that for August, 1938, but Â£2,453,000 below the July total. Raw materials sent abroad were worth Â£4,442,000 (against Â£4,539,000), and food, drink and tobacco Â£3,269,000 (against Â£2,952,000). As regards imports, from January August the returns show a decline from Â£281,696,000 to Â£266,368,000 in foodstuffs, from Â£172,572,000 to Â£165,545,000 in raw materials, but an advance from Â£157,876,000 to Â£168,947,000 in manu factures. Of the main classes of exports, manu factured goods at Â£243,524,000 still show an improvement of Â£3,100,000 over those in the corresponding period of 1938. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 2 MAINTAINING EXPORTS Confirmation of the exclusive informa tion published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday in regard to the efforts being made by British manufacturers to main- tain export trade is contained in an announcement made by Mr. Guy Locock, Director of the Federation of British Industries. He states that the Federation will do everything in its power to ensure that Britain's export trade receives the fullest possible consideration, subject to the requirements of the fighting services. He adds that, as stated in Te: FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, machinery has been set up by the Federation to ensure that export inquiries received by firms unable at the moment to carry them out can be passed on to others able to do so.",

   "text_content" : "MR. ARTHUR REED (U., Exeter) asked the President of the Board of Trade in the House of Commons yesterday on what calculations the premiums for compulsory insurance of stocks had been based. What percentage of the premium was expected to be taken up by administrative and brokerage expenses, he asked, and what was it proposed to do with the surplus profit on the premiums. MR. OLIVER STANLEY said that, as stated in a recent announcement, the rate of premium had to be fixed, in the absence of actual data, on a basis of assumption. It 1was too early yet to say whether these assumptions required modification. The fire insurance companies and Lloyd's had undertaken to work out a commodity insurance scheme as agents of the Government without profit to them- selves. It was the Government's inten- tion so to adjust the rate of premium from time to time in the light of developments as to provide a fund which would not be more than sufficient to meet claims and expenses. In reply to Mr. Dingle Foot (L., Dundee), Mr. Stanley said it had been assumed that in all cases this charge represented 6 per cent. on the stock. That, of course, was a complete fallacy-it depended on the amount of times stock had turned over during the course of the year. He was investigating cases now where the charge was being made to see if it represented 6 per cent. of the stock. It might only represent 1% per cent.",

It is a conditiot that the loan is payable in sterlinj and that the bank's head office is ii London. This information was conveyed t4 Stock Exchange members generall; yesterday by the posting of corre spondence which has passed betweei a House firm and the Committee. The firm wrote asking for assistance ii overcoming a difficulty expressed as fol lows:- \" We make to take from the market or Thursday next, the 21st instant, certair American shares (unregistered) in respec' of bargains transacted previous to 26tt August, 1939, and which securities were closed by our clients for cash (registered) \" Our problem now arises by reason oi us having to accept unregistered shares and deliver registered.

The Committee requests members t( accept this form when presented by th( members of the British Bankers Associa tion, both clearing and non-clearing banks and thus facilitate the collection of divi dends without presentation of the shares. The form shows that the guarantee is E strong one, and is in these terms:-\" Ir making this claim, we hereby hold yot harmless from any claim that may b( made by other parties under any pretexi whatsoever in respect of the said dividend and we confirm that the relative certifi- cates have been marked.\" The form requires the banks to fill in th< dates the dividends are due, the names ir which the shares are registered and tho names and addresses of claimants of the dividends. S.E. SETTLEMENTS Questions addressed to THE FINANCIAI TIMES indicate that some doubt still exists regarding the future of normal Stock Ex. change Settlements. Settlement dates had already been fixec ahead at the outbreak of war and the re- sulting decision that all new business war to be on a cash basis. The Stock Exchange Committee has since recommended that differences con nected with cash bargains should be settlec on 21st September for business transactec to 15th September, inclusive, and subse quently on the first working day of eack month in respect of deals up to the fifti previous working day. Inquiries made by THE FINANCIAL TIMEI have now confirmed that, despite suct Settlements, which deal solely with differ ences on cash transactions, the norma Stock Exchange Settlements remaii operative. The Settlement days following to-da3 are, as shown on the Stock Exchangt Official Lists, 12th and 26th October, anc 9th and 23rd November. At these Settlements, differences result. ing from remaining contangoes, and the settlement of forward bargains and options running before the outbreak of war, will be handled. The usual procedure of issuing Making-up prices will be followed.",

   "text_content" : "The eleventh ordinary general meeting of Initial Services, Ltd., was held yester- day at 300, Goswell-road, London, E.C. MIR. W, J. CHINNECK, who presided in the absence of Mr. A. P. Bigelow, chair- man and managing director, said that the trading profit for the year, including divi- dends declared by subsidiary companies, had increased by approximately Â£33,000 at Â£340,876. The Board now recommended a final dividend of 10d per share, carrying forward Â£10,603, against Â£16,218 brought in. In recommending the maintenance of the final dividend at 10d per share on the increased Ordinary capital, the directors had given very careful consideration to the position created by the war. They felt, in view of the very strong liquid resources of the company that they were justified in paying the same rate as in recent years, seeing that the profits were sufficient to pay the dividend comfortably and at the same time materially strengthen the re- serve with an addition of Â£50,000. liHe thought that the results disclosed would be considered satisfactory, considering that throughout the whole of the past financial year the political situation had been far from settled. PROSPECTS It was too early to form any reliable opinion as to how the war would affect the company's business during the current year. For July and August results had compared favourably with the correspond- ing period, but those two months had not included any of the war period. While the first duty of all was to do everything possible to assist the Government of the country, they had been glad to note from time to time the exhortations of the Government that business must go on, and shareholders might be sure that the direc- tors would do everything possible in the interests of the company. They might, perhaps, congratulate themselves that the services the company rendered to the public, and, indeed, to Government Depart- ments, were necessary services. While the company had already had a number of difficulties to face-particularly in conne'- tion with transport and the loss of certain of the staff called up for military duties and Civil Defence, they had, so far. with the loyal assistance of the staff, been able to overcome those difficulties. Although some of their customers had been moved from London, the company's organisation, spread as it was throughout the country, had enabled them to continue its service to many of them, and, indeed, they hoped with the aid of the branches throughout Great Britain to continue to give service to practically all their exist- ing customers. Those remarks must not, however, be taken to mean that the Board expected the present profits would be maintained dur- ing the coming year. As he had stated, it was too soon to judge what the effect of war might be. The Board hoped in any case that the expansion of the business would be renewed after the war, and mean- while the same quality of effort shown in the past would be applied to their new set of problems. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted, and a vote of thanks to the chairman, directors and staff closed the meeting.",

   "text_content" : "The third ordinary general meeting of Vaughan Brothers (Drop-Forgings), Ltd., was held yesterday at Wolverhampton. MR. FRANK H. VAUGHAN (chairman and managing director) said that he was pleased to present a report which he felt sure would give general satisfaction, especially as during the first six months of the year under review the works had not been fully employed. In the latter six months their new building had come into production for fully-machined component parts and that, with the help of their other machine shop, which had been, and was, fully occupied, had resulted in an increase in sales of finished parts of 300 per cent. over the previous year. Freehold land and buildings had in- creased by Â£10,582 and additions to plant had cost Â£4,216. The maintenance of plant and machinery was being kept fully up-to-date. Their concrete air-raid shelters for the employees were now practically completed and the scheme for evacuating the workpeople in case of an air-raid had been thoroughly worked out. As he had predicted last year, stocks and work in progress were down by nearly Â£6,000. They still had their Â£15,000 worth of War Stock. Their liquid position was still very strong. Although they had spent Â£14.800 on buildings and plant-about Â£300 more than in the previous year-if they added the figures of stock, debtors, War Loan and cash at bank and deducted creditors, the difference amounted to almost 50 per cent. of the issued capital. They had placed to reserve account another Â£5,000. bringing that account to Â£26.000, and were carrying forward Â£8,928, Â£3,500 more than in the previous year. With regard to the present year, sales for the first two months were 50 per cent. higher than in the previous year, but on war being declared all their orders for drop-forgings for pleasure cars were he'd up. They had, however, sufficient orders on their books for commercial lorry parts, War Office, Admiralty and aircraft contracts to keep the works fully ocrupied and, while present conditions continued, their resources would be taxed to the utmost. The report was unanimously adopted and a final dividend of 121% per cent., making 22% per cent. for the year was approved.",
