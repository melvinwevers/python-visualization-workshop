MONDAY Evening. Developments of outstanding im- portance were lacking to-day, condi- tions generally being much as hitherto. There was a keen demand for bills by the clearing banks and the undertone was none too firm. Only a modicum of business was reported, while in the foreign exchanges, too, conditions were quiet. Short loans were again in plentiful supply and borrowers were able to satisfy their requirements in outside quarters at 2% per cent. The clearing banks adhered to their lending rates of 3 per cent. against bills and 3% per cent. against bonds. As in- dicated above, the banks were ready buyers of short-dated maturities, being willing to take October and November dates at 3 per cent. and December maturities at 3% per cent. The response from sellers was still below expectations. \" Hot \" Treasury bills commanded a very fine rate owing to their being end-year maturities and business was reported down to 3 per cent. Leading houses quoted 3%- 3'/ per cent. as their buying rates for three months bank drafts. IsCOU DiscumNT PI' l T. Loies PER CENT.

Only a very moderate business was reported in the silver market and prices for little interest being manifested, prices for spot and forward delivery were unchanged at 23yd per ounce. In the leading foreign exchanges Belgian belgas continued to lose ground in terms of sterling, the rate being adjusted a further 10 centimes to 23.65. Dutch guilders also cheapened from 7.50 to 7.55, .while the Swiss franc lost 5 centimes at 17.70. The United States dollar remained at $4.03 and the Canadian dollar at $4.45. In the \"free\" market, Italian lire continued their recent decline and eased to 78. Yugoslavian dinar reacted to 205 sellers and the Shanghai dollar to 4%d.

   "text_content" : "DEVEJLO From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 25th Sept. The Stock Market moved narrowly in the dullest trading this month, and late realising was a restrictive influence. The final list recorded changes of fractions to $1 in both directions. Total turnover dwindled to 1,230,000 shares. The opening was quiet, with price move- ments narrowly irregular. Traders were cautious on growing expectations that a peace offer will be coming shortly; they were also awaiting developments at Washington. Consequently the market was very dull during the morning, and at midday minor losses predominated. In the early afternoon the undertone improved on selective buying. Support for Rails was an outstanding feature. Steels improved, with this week's fresh gain of 4 points in mill activity to practically 84 per cent. of capacity about as expected. Motors were assisted by a report that passenger car registrations so far in Sep- tember are about 37 per cent. more than at the same period last year. Aircrafts, Chemicals and Oils were inde- cisive, Oils showing no response to talk of a possible advance shortly in crude oil prices in Texas and perhaps over the en- tire mid-Continent field. Utilities were in some demand. In the later trading profit taking appeared, and the close was irregular. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average declined 0.35, but Rails rose 0.47 to 33.81 and Utilities 0.07 to 24.70. Dealings comprised 858 stoqks, of which 358 im- proved, 294 declined and 206 were un- changed. In the Bond market U.S. Governments were quiet and Railroads firm. Bond sales totalled $13,520,000. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was 171.5, against 172.5 on Saturday. Engineering construction awards for the week to 21st September totalled $69,348,000, against $50,472,000 previous week and $82,252,000 a year ago. Private awards accounted for $26,917,000, $13,836,000 and $10,564,000 respectively. The Maritime Commission has awarded contracts for an additional 11 cargo vessels. The Federal Reserve return for the week to 20th September shows a rise in gold stocks of $94 millions to the new high of $16,902 millions. Holdings of U.S. Government securities increased $2,760,000 to $2,826,480,000. Member banks' excess reserves over legal requirements rose $10 millions to $5,280 millions, a fresh peak. Silver imports in the week to 15th Sep- tember amounted to $1,027,000, including $167,000 from Canada and $476,000 from Mexico. Cotton totalling 1,985,000 bales was sold for export under the subsidy programme between 1st August and 18th September. AVERAGES AND VOLUME 4 Home It til Trading.

It was very natural that potential investors were disposed yesterday to remain aloof awaiting Sir John Simon's first War Budget. But it was unfortunate that an absence of buying orders should have coincided with a spasm of weakness in Royal Dutch and Shell. This was attributed to Amsterdam anxiety as to German activities on the Dutch frontier and consequently had a certain disturbing effect on the House generally. Dutch and Shell Royal Dutch, which were over 42 ten days ago, were down to 361 at one time yesterday. Although they finished well above the worst at 38, the shares were 25s lower on the ses- sion. Shell were 6s 3d down at 84s 42d, after 83s 9d. It was estimated that .more than 10,000 Shell must have changed hands yesterday. Jobbers can always find a home for these shares on any sharp fall. I hear it frequently argued that Shell must be one of the soundest equities to hold for either war or peace. The Royal Dutch-Shell group's activities are so world-wide that what is lost in one market will, it is contended, usually be made up in another. Bethlehem Bears Curiously enough, although Amster- dam was said to have started the setback in leading Oil shares, it was suspected to have been largely respon- sible for a sharp rise in Bethlehem Steel. Bethlehem closed on Saturday in New York at the equivalent of 1141, London. They opened here yesterday morning around that price, but by the time the Stock Exchange closed at 2 p.m. had spurted to 119. A leading jobber felt pretty certain that Amster- dam was trying to even up a bear position, though whether on its own account or for American clients it was impossible to say. A Sure Winner? If President Roosevelt wins his fight over the neutrality legislation Bethle- hem is starred as a sure winner in the show of \"war babies.\" The corpora- tion is the second largest steel enter- prise in the world and yet has only 3,184,000 Common shares in issue. United States Steel has 8,703,250 shares outstanding. When Bethlehem was last in the dividend list-namely, in 1937-$5 per share was distributed and the stock touched 105J, New York. At the pre- sent official rate of exchange this would be equal to 130, London. Imps. and Bats. Late offering of Imperial and British-American Tobaccos was as- sumed to be more a case of some holders wanting immediate cash than any violent reflection of Budget anxiety. Anyway, the latter company is primarily concerned with overseas markets. I imagine that Imps. at 101s 3d and Bats. at 80s will attract a fresh bevy of bargain-hunters this morning. In point of fact no one would be surprised if tobacco escaped to- morrow any addition to the heavy new impost laid upon it last April. It is considered possibly significant that no special restrictions have-so I am told -been enforced this week on with- drawals of tobacco from bond. With what seems to me dubious wisdom, the chief tobacco companies are under- stood to be offsetting the heavy ex- pense of war insurance, A.R.P., etc., by drastically reducing their adver- tising allocations. 7hp r tarts",

   "text_content" : "IJVIL I JSAPJJL From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT AMSTERDAM, 25th Sept. The Dutch Government has taken a number of emergency measures to safe- guard trade and industry. These provide for control and effective co-operation between the State and industrial interests in order to safeguard as far as possible the normal course of business. The measures comprise export pro- hibitions, the establishment of central organisations for contact between the Government and private industry, and the prohibition of commodity hoarding and undue price increases. Centralisation of imports and the raising of agricultural productive capacity are among the other steps taken. WOOL CONCERN TO SUSPEND Fuhrmann and Co., the large inter- national wool concern, of Amsterdam, has applied to the Court for permission to sus- pend payments. Its assets are estimated at some Fla.13,000,000 (about Â£1,730W000), with liabilities for Fls.19,000,000 (Â£2,534,000). Capital totals Fls.10,000,000 (Â£1,334,000). It is reported that several large Dutch banks are involved."

Stock Markets failed to-day to main- tain last week's cheerfulness. Busi- ness showed little improvement and the atmosphere was subdued, although by no means depressed. The nearer approach of Budget day was suggested as a reason for the irregular appearance of Industrials. Marking down of the leading Oils on sales from Amsterdam doubtless affected the general tone in existing thin markets. Although the tendency was uncer- tain, some firm features developed. Home and Foreign Railways and Brewery shares were among the sec- tions to improve. Business marked in all markets was 2,800, compared with 2,197 on Friday and 2,460 on Monday last. Activity in the gilt-edged market again consisted mainly of exchanges from the long-dated stocks into Conversion 4% per cents., in which quite a fair business was recorded, with many special marks up to 104. Ordinary transactions were merely from the minimum of 100% to 101. Normal business in other British Funds at the fixed minima was as difficult as ever. Conversion Fives were quoted ex dividend at 103% and Funding Fours at 100%. Business in Dominion stocks was gener- ally close to minimum figures, although Australia 3% per cent. 1954-59 changed hands up to 74, compared with a fixed price of 72. Gilt-edged prices Page 4 JAPANESE BONDS WEAK There was little life in the Foreign Bond market. The only trend in evidence was a desire to sell Japanese bonds. The 4 per cent., 1910, and the 5 per cent., 1907, loans were each 1 point down at 23A and 28%. The 6 per cent., 1924, and the 5% per cent. (Tokyo) issues were also on offer and closed slightly lower at 35 and 31% respectively. Argentines were in quiet demand, although few changes were recorded. Europeans showed scattered weakness, but the amount of stock sold was small and movements were rare. Continued appre- hension at the situation of Belgium was reflected in a further fall of 1V points to 56 in the Belgian 4 per cent., 1936, loan. Elsewhere, Austrian 4% per cent. were fractionally weaker at 37. Foreign Bond prices Page 4 BRUM. PREF. ADVANCE The return to strength of the Home Rail market continued to-day and while prices advanced the volume of business showed a slight expansion. L.M.S. 4 per cent. Pref- erence, which were last week the only prior charge to rise above the minimum leveTlarianged by-TW-Jo2f bers, again went ahead. At the close leading firms were quoting the stock a full point higher at 50% and during the day it was possible to sell at 49%, 1% points above the fixed minimum of 48. Ordinary stocks made further headway in some cases. Great Western were 1 point higher at 25% and Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary added another X to close at 9%. In the Foreign Rail market conditions were quiet but prices were firmly inclined. Speculative interest in junior Argentine stocks was again in evidence and buyers found little difficulty in completing their purchases. B. A. Western were favoured and closed Y better at 6%, while Central Argentine showed a small improvement at 8. Elsewhere buying of San Paulo fol- lowing last week's decision to increase rates continued on a small scale, and the price improved to 26. American Rails made a mixed showing but were firmer on the whole following Wall Street's response to forecasts of further increases in weekly freight load- ings. The movement was largely one of prices and little stock changed hands. Atchison and Chesapeake and Ohio were each quoted 1 point higher at 38 and 52 respectively and Union Pacific were 5 dollars to the good at 122%. Home and Foreign Rail prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS UNSETTLED A Few Gains; Moderate Falls Predominate Budget possibilities tended to unsettle some sections of the Industrial market and the tone throughout was irregular. Some selling was in progress, and, although in the main light, it proved a cause of weak- ness in a few directions and the course of prices generally was marked by a good deal of irregularity. Some weight was attached to the idea that the Chancellor may think it expedient to impose special taxation on branches of trade, apart from rearmament, unlikely to be affected seriously by war conditions. This revived fears of an increased duty on tobacco and Tobacco shares accordingly lost their late recovery. Some Brewery shares, on the other hand, were firmer, the view obtaining that in the recent setback prices had been marked down too severely. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 84.1, against 85.4. A more hopeful feeling prevailed regarding the income-tax and BANKING shares in places showed rises. , Barclays \"B\" gained 4s further to 60s and West- minsters 3s 6d to 63s 6d. National Pro- vincial \"A\" rose 5s to 37s 6d and the \"B\" 2s 6d further. District \"A\" were easier. Some Colonial issues were lower. INSURANCE shares definitely were firmer with Prudential \"B \" favoured at 52s 6d. Sun were marked up 3s 9d to 61s 3d. Few deals were concluded among ELEC- TRIC SUPPLY securities and price changes were small. County of London Electrics on some inquiry hardened to 29s, but Metropolitan Electrics were Is down at 36s 6d and British Powers were sellers at 22s. nesisUance t L cu UUW1iWaU brtIu uA ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS was shown by Crompton Parkinson \"A,\" which attracted up to 15s. Ever Readys kept steady. Associated Electricals on some selling were lowered Is 9d to 31s 3d. Johnson and Phillips closed 2s 6d down at 33s 9d, while Siemens were marked down Is 3d. MOTORS were quiet. Albions eased, being rather sellers at 40s. Fords gave way 9d to 14s 9d and Morris were dull at 24s, after Friday's recovery of Is 9d. Tillings were a better market at 33s 9d. AVIATION issues were notable for a rise of 9d to 31s 8d in Imperial Airways. De Havillands fell 'Is 3d, to 31s 3d and both Faireys and Hawker Siddeleys were slightly easier. In COMPONENTS, J. Lucas were offered and closed 2s 6d lower at 51s 3d. Dunlops and Triplex Glass were dull., Some of the popular SHIPPING issues were a shade firmer, notably Furness Withys, Coast Lines and Cairns. Union Castles eased to 10s. In the few instances where IRON and STEEL shares received a little attention prices improved. Dorman Longs rose is 6d to 22s 6d and Guest Keens 9d to 22s, the Second tax-free Preference improving Is to 22s 6d. United Steels, after last week's advance, were hesitant around 21s. John Browns attracted at 25s. Neepsend Steel were 2s 6d lower at 65s. The principal TEXTILES were' firmer. Patons and Baldwins attracted at 48s. Lancashire Cottons firmed up to 13s and English Sewing Cottons gained 9d to 24s Gd. RAYONS were uncertain. Cour- taulds, after changing at 26s 6d, closed easier at 25s 9d. British Celanese Ordi- nary improved to 4s 73d. American reacted to 6%. Among STORES, Woolworth were steady enough around 52s 6d and Great Universal rallied 9d to 17s. Gamage and Maple were each 7%d lower. The Drapery group lacked support. TOBACCOS reacted. Taxation fears left Imperials %, lower at 5%'/ and in sym- pathy British-American were %2 down at 4 and Imperial of Canada 2s 6d easier at 57s 6d. In the main, the trend of BREWERY shares was upward and the few exceptions represented minor declines. Feature was '% gain to 3% in Ind Coopes. Hewitts were 2s 6d lower. Alcohol issues were dull, with Seager Evans weaker at 12s 3d. Among Miscellaneous, Qualcasts were lowered to 19s on the report. Turner and Newalls and Pinchin Johnsons shed 2s 6d apiece. Little was going on in American Indus- trials. Bethlehems were 119, U.S. Steels 96, Nickels 50Y/ (after 52), Chryslers 107 and General Motors 66. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS CHEAPEN Nothing occurred in the commodity market to arouse interest in Rubber shares. The spot quotation for crude rubber during Stock Exchange hours was '/d cheaper at 9Â¼d per pound, and share prices were iccordingly marked lower. Buyers of some of the good-class florin issues were in evidence. Bertam Consolidated hardened 1.d to 2s 6d, while Semenyih, which advanced on Friday from 2s 6d to 2s 9d, went further ahead to-day to 2s 10/d. Among the market leaders small offering of Rubber Trust depressed the price 3d to 26s 9d and Anglo-Dutch eased to 25s 3d. On the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange conditions in the Rubber share section were also dull. Buyers were said to be awaiting Wednesday's Budget statement. Rubber Trust were 27s and Anglo-Dutch 25s 6d. The Stock Exchange market for Tea shares was idle, with prices mainly unchanged. Jokai came on offer and weakened Is 3d to 25s, as did Bandarapola, which finished at 23s 9d, against 25s. Panawatte were weak, falling from 8s 1!d to 6s 10,d. Eastern Produce realised 35s 3d, Imperial Preference 19s and Rajawella 3s 7%d. In Mincing Lane Carolina Preference were on offer at 25s 6d. Rubber and Tea prices Page 4 OIL RISE REVERSED The advance in Oil shares, which have provided some of the best features of the markets since war began, was sharply checked to-day. Under the lead of Shells and Royal Dutch, both of which showed severe declines, the market suffered a general reaction. A lower week-end quotation from Am- sterdam gave Royal Dutch a poor start, which was aggravated later by what was described as nervous selling from Holland. Partly in sympathy and partly as a result of some special selling, Shells also gave way. Both shares proved vulnerable in current narrow markets and Dutch finished 1% down at 38, after 37%, and Shells %s lower at 4%,, after 4%6. Other declines were smaller, the most severe being a loss of ', in Burmahs at 3%/~. Anglo-Iranians at 3% and Trinidad Leaseholds at 4% both were %e down, while Mexican Eagles were 6d down at is 7%d and Canadians 4Â¼d off at 8s 9d. Although Budget fears were mentioned as a reason for the weakness of the Oil market it was not generally thought that .here would be any addition to the petrol tax. Oil Share Prices Page 4 MINES MOSTLY LOWER Rhokana and Selection Trust Relapse Sharply Although the majority of price move- ments in Kaffirs were downwards, it could not be said that there was any real general trend. Business was too limited for this .o develop. Quotations were swayed by small orders in individual shares irregu- arly divided between buyers and sellers. As far as Johannesburg was concerned, arbitrageurs rarely found it worth while ven to get in touch with their opposite lumbers in that centre. Of the non-producers, Western Holdings relapsed Is to 7s and Western Reefs Yi to /. Marievale at 14s and Palms. at 4s 3d each declined 3d. Among the producers, City Deep, Durban Deep, Grootvlei, :rakpan and Kleinfontein were marked up sA. On the other hand, Geduld lost Â¼ to 7, as did Sub Nigel to 9. Crown dropped A to 14%. Largest move in the Finance :roup was a recession of % in Rand Mines to 8. Anglo-American, General Mining and Gold Fields weakened 'e apiece. 'There was some attempt to put West Africans better in early dealings, but by he close price changes were unimportant. :,old Coast Selection eased 3d to 15s 3d. Ashanti kept at 3Â¼s. The amelioration of Australia's new oild tax, announced in Saturday's issue, 'ailed to find reflection in the shares, among which Wiluna receded 3d tn 7s 3d ana ouanmi rreierence were lowerea oa further to 3s. Elsewhere, Oriental Con- solidated were unchanged on balance at their new high level for the current year of 2%; the shares opened rather buyers and closed rather sellers at this price. Rhodesian Coppers lacked support. Weak spots were Rhokana, % down at 11% and Selection Trust Is off at 12s. Rho- desian Anglo-American gave way 6d to 22s 3d, as did Chartered to 19s. A con- trary movement consisted of a gain of Y to 12 in Rio Tinto. Tins 'were quiet and indecisive in tone. Sungei Besi rose %' to 1, as did Aramayo to 14/, but Hongkong shed %a to '%s. Dealas reppted little interest in Lead- Zinc issues.: Miic Ordinary closed %X lower at 3S. and New Broken Hill 3d down at 13s 3d. Mining share prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "SHARES The eyes of the Stock Exchange wait upon Sir John Simon, pending his announcement to-morrow. The mar- kets round the House remain in expectancy. \"Budgetitis\" attacked Tobacco shares and other popular Industrials. The Mining markets are as quiet as the rest; in the new House there is no more animation noticeable than there was in the old. Opinion is inclined to think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will refrain from turning the screw too tightly at present, and that he will prefer to leave himself at least the possibility of increasing national revenue later on. Argentine Railways Argentine Rails are among those in which it is possible to obtain, in a fair number of stocks, a dealing price. Speculation busies itself with the idea that this market is likely to be one of the first to recover when business becomes more liquid as a whole. The Ordinary stocks - Central Argentine, for instance, at 81, and B.A. Great Southern at about 9-are being picked up by the gambler (who would rather, perhaps, be designated the speculative investor), from whose point of view it must be acknowledged that present prices afford, in a hackneyed Stock Exchange. phrase, scope for talent. Oils Offered Amsterdam went jittery on German apprehensions; a few attempted sales from that quarter lowered the price of Royal Dutch shares, and the rest of the Oil market sympathetically de- clined. To make the punishment fit the crime, a suggestion was advanced to the effect that our Government may decide to fix the price of petrol them- selves. This consideration introduced a new note of uncertainty into the Oil market, the effect of which can be seen by reference to this morning's list of prices. Ashanti Gold For anyone who feels that he would like to put money into Gold-mining shares, yet is doubtful as to which he should choose out of the wide selec- tion now at his disposal, a good many of us would, I think, indicate Ashanti Goldfields. The price is 63s 9d and the dividend for some time past has been 95 per cent. on these 4s shares. The yield is comparatively modest, but on each occasion that the profits have warranted a step-up of the divi- dend into three figures, the company has elected, instead, to offer a bonus share issue. Boots No special reason transpired to ex- plain the drop in Boots shares. The market, pressed for a cause, fell back upon the excuse that for some time past Boots have been standing rela- tively high, and that, accordingly, holders were tempted to sell, in order to put the money into something which paid better. A more plausible explanation is that there are still people about who have to raise money for one reason or another, and that they are obliged to sell whatever is saleable. This accounts for the dulness in a number of markets round the House. It seems both illogical and anoma- lous that shares which, nowadays, are the most marketable should be, on that very account, the most vulnerable as regards their prices. AutlgVns",

   "text_content" : "S The gold industry is gradually find- ing a new basis. The Union of South Africa is taking for its Treasury any- thing above 150s per ounce realised by the mines, while the Common- wealth Government has decided to introduce a 50 per cent. excise duty on the excess price of gold over Â£A.9. The latter is appreciably more generous than the South African arrangement. In the first place it involves a sliding scale, and secondly, at the present price of the metal, the amount to be received by the mines should be, in sterling, some 6s per ounce more than in South Africa. The first proposition in Australia was for a 75 per cent. duty on the excess price, but that was rejected by the Senate. No doubt the Western Australian spokesmen pleaded strongly that such an impost for the financing of the Common- wealth's war effort would bear with undue severity on one State. A second and more practical reason for the Senate's modification of the duty was probably the fact that gold mining in Australia is by no means so prosperous an industry as in South Africa. Even before the gold premium a special subsidy had been introduced, and in present circumstances there would have been an obvious danger in embarking on anything that might appear to be restrictive taxation. It is interesting, too, to note that the ostensible reasons for the Australian and the South African actions are very different. Both, of course, have the common ground that it would be un- fair to allow gold producers to benefit unduly from currency depreciation elsewhere which is burdening other members of the community, especially since the prices of other metals are being controlled. But the Australian tax is for revenue purposes, whereas the South African impost is said to be regarded primarily as a safeguard against inflation. It would be unwise, however, to assume that either Australia or South Africa has acted on anything but em- pirical grounds. It is improbable that a serious attempt has been made to work out a fair theoretical price for gold. Indeed, such a task is probably imprac- ticable. The case against the mines being allowed the full fortuitous benefit of the rise in the gold price will be generally accepted. On the other hand, the problem of estimating how far costs are likely to rise and at what point limitation of profits would threaten to interfere with new development is full of obvious and insurmountable pitfalls. The matter can only be tackled by a process of trial and error, and it is to be hoped that both the Union and the Com- monwealth will watch developments in the gold-mining industries with close sympathy. It is perhaps significant that Southern Rhodesia, while concur- ring in general South African policy in this respect, has decided to make re- bates on the tax in respect of any increases in working costs or other charges.",

   "text_content" : "An illustration of the fashion in which efficient and conservative management can overcome practical obstacles in industry is afforded by the S experience of the Cannock Associated Collieries last year. The account given to shareholders yesterday by the S Chairman, Mr. W. H. Harrison, shows how the company was able to meet the difficult conditions of an unusually trying period. There were neverthe- less compensating factors, and in the outcome the company was able to in- crease its sales and substantially im- prove its results. One of the features of the period was uneven demand, which ran on certain sizes and qualities of coal to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a con- siderable increase amounting to Â£57,000 in the wages bill, the holidays S with pay movement imposing an extra S charge. On the other hand, the existence of a central selling staff and co-ordina- tion between the constituent com- panies contributed to greater efficiency S in the underground workings. Lower costs of pit props and general stores, while prices remained steady under the selling schemes in operation, also conduced to the better result shown. The company stands in a strong posi- tion in respect of its current assets. It is in the fortunate situation of having large areas of coal yet un- developed for which its liquid re- sources will be readily available, and these assets will have a value in any agreement which may be reached for future amalgamations in the coalfield.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The reference in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday to the obligations placed upon banks to receive gold coin and bullion was greeted with interest. In many instances, would-be sellers of gold have not been given as much help and guidance as they should have been. Some banks have gone out of their way to stimulate sales of bullion and coin by British nationals. They are aware of clients in possession of the metal, but this knowledge and their powers of persuasion have not been successful in numerous instances. There is still too much holding out for a better price by clients who say \"As no definite date has been fixed, I'll wait a bit.\" The general public's duty is to back up the Government. So far as can be ascertained there is as yet no inten- tion of fixing a final date for for- feiture. It may have been nothing more than coincidence that one of the leading firms of bullion brokers reported a busier day yesterday. Discount Change The announcement that Roger Cun- liffe Sons and Co. are to change their status is the more interesting because they are the oldest concern in the mar- ket, having been established 120 years ago. The name Cunliffe is a house- hold word in finance and the good wishes of the City will be extended to this doyen of the discount market. A further development in this market would not occasion surprise. Meantime, the depletion of staffs through national demands has brought back some of the \"old\" hands to help carry on. Congo Bullion In view of the rise in the insurance rates, the Belgian Government has given instructions to stop the shipment of gold mined in the Belgian Congo. The gold production which was nor- mally sold to the National Bank of Belgium will now be retained locally, and arrangements have been made with the Banque du Congo Belge to receive the bullion on deposit for account of the National Bank. In view of the possible threat to Belgian neutrality this course seems wise.",

The busi- ness of lawn mowers and precision iron castings manufacture enjoyed another successful trading year to 30th June, but until the war situation is clarified the Board's recommenda- tions as to the distribution of the record profits are postponed. The meeting will be convened later when the Chairman is able to present a clearer view of the outlook. Had the times been normal the Board would have proposed a final dividend of 10 per cent. and a cash bonus, making 30 per cent. for the year, or the same as last time. That payment would be well within profits, since available earnings ex- ceed the equivalent of 61 per cent. on the Ordinary capital, as compared with 50 per cent. in the previous year. The business is progressing well, for the order book is described as very satisfactory.

A further ex- pansion of interests was signalised by the acquisition of the Babbington Coal Company's Derbyshire collieries. The financial position is strong. While naturally the Chairman was not disposed to enter into forecasts about the course of trade in the current year, he noted that the results to date have been satisfactory.

   "text_content" : "A hint of the changes impending in industry owing to war conditions was given by Mr. S. M. Wilford, chairman of W. H. Dorman and Co., at yester- day's meeting. The company manu- factures internal combustion engines, portable electric lighting sets, printing machinery and other engineering pro- ducts. It was actively engaged during the past year, and experienced an increase in the quantity and value of sales, but gross profit was slightly lower as a result of competitive selling prices and difficulties of production owing to the crisis a year ago. The possibility of considerable changes in the company's activities and earning power is envisaged. Like many others it is faced with the necessity of con- serving .resources to the utmost to ensure a continuance of growth and development, while at the same time recognising the desirability of keeping the economic machine going by means of dividends. An attempt has been made to strike the happy medium by the payment of a small dividehd on the Ordinary shares, the first for many years, while at the same time transferring a sub- stantial sum to reserve. Sales for the first six months of the current sinan- cial year have increased, and orders on the books are in excess of those for the corresponding period a year ago. The fact that the outbreak of war may necessitate the rearrangement of the business is fully recognised, but it is as yet too early'to forecast the line this may take."

You should consult your bank as to reinvestment as it will be in a position to obtain information through its head office from one of the Australian banks as to the best course to pursue. 2. Roan may well turn out as good as any. Dominion-It would appear that the price given in the Toronto list is incorrect and that the New York Curb quotation is the correct one. We regret having to contract the list but in existing conditions such a step was necessary. Farmer-Your holdings are very fair invest- ments and we see no reason to advise you to sell any of them at present. Frozen In-It is difficult to say what is the best course to pursue, but, on the whole, we should be inclined to remain as you are for the present. Heather-Until the Government announces its intentions it is useless to speculate as to what terms will be offered. We think that holders will be fairly treated. H. M. S.-1. The question is how much the war is likely to delay attainment of the production stage, in any event not scheduled until the latter half of next year. 2. We consider the notes too speculative for a current purchase. 3. London Mid- land and Scottish Railway Four per Cent. Preference would be a promising purchase giving the yield desired. Inquirer C-With regard to the shares men- tioned registration is not necessary. J. E. M. B.-We have no doubt as to the soundness of the leading concerns of the kind and see no reason to dissuade you from investing as suggested. J. P.-It is a sound concern and we should say that the chance of a call being made is very remote. In our opinion the shares should be held. Pop-1. We would hold Gold Coast Selection Trusts and Davis and Timmins. 2. We do not care for these. Roger-It is doubtful whether a sale could be effected. In any event, the price would be too small to make selling worth while. Subscriber and Shareholder-We can only suggest that you apply direct to the management for the information desired. Waiting-All the shares named are specula- tive, and the market in them is little more than nominal. On the whole, we would hold them in hope of being able to realise to better advantage later on. W. J. C.-The position is most unfortunate, but unless you can persuade the company to make a concession, we do not see that there is anything you can do in the matter. W. R. C.-You have a very mixed list of holdings, but we do not think it worth while to attempt to sell any of them now. No. 1 last changed hands at 1id. There is no market in Nos. 2, 3 and 6. No. 4 is quoted 125;, No. 9 17s and No. 10 4s 9d.",

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange markets were irregular yesterday under the influence of to-morrow's Budget. Uncertainties regarding the Chancellor's proposals accounted for heavy declines in some leading Industrials. Another adverse factor was nervous selling from Holland which caused the sharp fall in Royal Dutch of 1l to 38, after 37Â½. This was partly responsible for sympathetic weakness in Shells, which closed 5-16ths down at 4 7-32nds, after 4 3-16ths. Last week's improvements in the Home Railway market made further progress. Prices of some of the leading Ordinary stocks advanced, Great Western putting on a point at 251. L.M.S. Four per Cent. Preference also showed a rise of a point to 50J, a figure well above the unofficial minimum of 48-50 recently fixed by jobbers. This improvement was based on a hardening belief that the announce ment of Government compensation to be paid to the railways for the use of the systems will be made shortly. Yesterday's reaction in Industrials followed an improvement at the end of last week, attributed to the fixing of Budget Day and the knowledge thai taxation uncertainties were soon to be dispelled. This evidence of relief was considered a normal Stock Exchange response, but yesterday, with the Budget only two days away, previous fears regarding the fate of individual industries at the hands of the Chan cellor were renewed. SENSITIVE CONDITION Little Resisting Power Part of yesterday's weakness was a reflection of the severe setback in Royal Dutch and Shells. Markets are at present in a highly sensitive condition, with very little resisting power, and a fall in the leaders of one section may easily be com- municated to other markets. Revived taxation fears caused Tobacco shares to lose part of last week's recovery, Breweries, on the other hand, displayed firmness on the idea that the recent set- back had been overdone. Insurance and HIome Banking shares also showed a bettez tendency. The following table shows some of the day's outstanding share price move- ments:- Y'day's Rise or close fall British Amer.

A proposal to make it illegal for anyone in the United States to sell bonds or securities of the belligerent Powers is contained in the Administration's new neutrality legislation, which was submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to-day by Senator Key Pittman, the chair- man. The Bill includes President Roose- velt's recommendation for the repeal of the arms embargo. The Bill also seeks to prohibit the ex- tension to belligerents of credits or loans, although the President may permit 90-day credits. The President would report to congress every six months on the amount of short-term credits thus extended. Other main points are that the solicita- tion of funds for belligerents, except for medical aid, food and clothing, would be prohibited; export of munitions would be licensed. It would be unlawful for Ameri- can vessels to carry passengers or cargo to any State named; buyers from the belli- gerent Powers would have to acquire title to goods before shipment (the \"cash and carry \" principle). The Bill was drawn up by a Committee of Democrats and a decision on it will be taken by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday.-Ex. Tel.",

   "text_content" : "By C. B. ORMEROD Forced selling which took place on the London Stock Exchange early last week seems to have marked the end of neces- sitous liquidation for cash purposes. This selling resulted in a new bear market low level for THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index of 83.4; the Home Rail index did not make a new low, but at 39.8 held nearly five points above its bear market low of 35.2. Non-confirmation is a recog- nised Dow Theory indication that the trend currently in force may be in process of reversal. It has frequently been stated in recent articles of this series that the London bear market is in its third and last phase because (a) it has lasted for nearly thrc2 years, which is almost as long as that of 1929-32, the most severe ever experienced, (b) the extremely low volume of trading, which nearly always accompanies the last phase of a bear market, and (e) the sharp reak subsequent to the declaration of war, which fulfils Dow Theory require- ments of third phases. PROBABLE TREND Gradual formation of an upward zig- zag pattern by THE FINANCIAL TIMES Rail and Industrial indices, with volume in- creasing on days of advancing price and diminishing on days of reaction, would confirm what is now only a probability, that the inflationary economic background of a European war will eventually result, as in 1915-20, in a selective bull market for equities as opposed to cash. Since early July Wall Street has been in the early stages of a primary bull market. Certain warning signals have recently crept into the price structure, which suggest that a period of consolida- tion or even a full secondary reaction correcting the sensational advance since the outbreak of war may lie ahead. Failure of the Industrial average to confirm last week's new bull market peak recorded by the Rail average and the slackening volume as the advance proceeds suggests that the pressure is not sufficient to force prices much higher just yet. Without a new high by the Industrial average fairly soon-that is, a rise to above 155.92-a retirement by the averages to within a one to two-thirds retracement zone (148-140 for the Indus- trial average and 30-28 for Rails) is probable prior to the generation of a new impetus, which is almost certain sooner or later to carry American Common stocks to considerably higher levels.",

The balance is struck after depre- ciation and other charges, but before providing Â£61,938 (against Â£77,327) for taxation. The net profit remaining is Â£124,446, equivalent to 34 1-3rd per cent. gross on the Â£500,000 of capital. DIVIDEND AGAIN 30% It is proposed to pay a final dividend of 16% per cent., less tax, the same rate as last year, and again making a total of 30 per cent., less tax, for the 12 months. Reserve is to be brought up to Â£115,000 by the allocation of Â£15,000 and Â£20,249 carried forward. Last year Â£19,554 was carried over after Â£25,000 each to general reserve and dividend equalisation fund.

   "text_content" : "1 3 )f r f s f D s I1 t t ,1 t. 1 The Government is to remedy cer- tain grievances of metal dealers against the current rigid system of market control. Assurances to this effect were given yesterday by repre- sentatives of the Ministry of Supply. The representatives first met a com- mittee of the London Metal Exchange, and subsequently discussed matters at a well-attended meeting of members in the Exchange itself. As reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Saturday, when the meeting was exclusively foreshadowed, the principal grievances of dealers have been: (1) The maximum prices for copper, lead and zinc make no allowance for dealers' commissions. (2) Traders in tin are forbidden to resell at a substantial profit in the United States metal bought in London at about Â£230, a practice indulged by American firms. (3) The cost of the Government com- modity stock insurance scheme cannot be passed on to the consumer. COMMISSION ALLOWANCES As regards commissions, it was ex- plained that dealers will receive an allowance in respect of contracts with consumers. Apparently the Ministry of Supply intends to provide metal for dealers at a slightly cheaper rate than that charged for direct sales to the public. Another important concession is to be made regarding dealings in tin. London traders are to be permitted to iell to the United States at over Â£230 a ton, though the stipulation is that the premium should be kept within reasonable limits. Over Â£290 a ton has recently been obtained in America by U.S. dealers who bought in London at about Â£230. No final arrangements have been made for passing on to consumers the cost of commodity stock insurance, which in some cases has made the sale of dealers' sup- plies unprofitable. But negotiations are believed to be in hand for the Government to take over dealers' stocks together with the insurance risks. Firms wishing to retain supplies will be allowed to do so. Outstanding pre-war contracts in copper, lead and zinc are to be closed at the official prices. Consumers requiring metal will apply to the Government. Those who have sold short will be liable for the maximum price. In the general discussion with the repre- sentatives of the Ministry of Supply there was some criticism by members of the low level at which prices have been fixed. In reply it was argued that when the immediate post-war buying wave has abated metal quotations in the United States and elsewhere should return nearer to the British.level.",

An Ordinary interim dividend of 10 per cent. (same) has been paid, but decision as to the distribution of the balance of profit is held in abeyance. In a letter to shareholders reproduced in the report Mr. J. E. V. Jobson, chairman and managing director, states that owing to the war \" and the situation not having had time to clarify itself your directors propose to postpone the meeting (usually held this month) until a later date. when they hope to be able to make recommendations.\" In the meantime the report shows what would have been their recommendations in normal times. The final dividend and bonus at 10 per cent. each (again making 30 per cent., less tax, for the year) would have required Â£21,967 and after Â£22,750 (against Â£25,000) to reserve Â£36,288 would remain to carry forward after crediting Â£39,813 brought in. All the subsidiaries are stated to have operated at satisfactory figures and show consistent progress. In view of the growth of the investments in these companies, a consolidated balance-sheet is now embodied in the report. This shows current assets at Â£302,666 against current liabilities of Â£84,911, a surplus of Â£217,755. No good- will appears in the assets of the sub- sidiaries.

   "text_content" : "MR. W. H. McCONNEL'S SPEECH The seventy-fifth ordinary general meeting of the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Company was held yesterday in Sheffield. MR. W. H. McCONNEL presided. The notice convening the meeting and the auditors' report were read by Mr. T. E. Haslam, secretary and director. The Chairman said: I wish first to say a word on the loss the Board and the com- pany have sustained by the death of our friend and colleague Sir Henry Norman; he had been on the Board for nearly 27 years; his wide knowledge of business and is scientific and literary attainments made him a very valuable director. We are missing him very much. We have been fortunate enough to obtain the help of Major J. Leslie and Mr. L. C. Hodges as new directors. I should like to impress or the share- holders that the company is greatly to be congratulated on this accession to our councils, not only for the fact that it draws into closer sympathy the management of Sheepbridge and its valued associated com- pany, the Yorkshire Amalgamated Col- lieries, but also because their knowledge and experience of the financial and technical branches of the coal trade will be of the greatest assistance to the Board. Another event of note in the year under review is the acquisition of the Babbington Coal Company's Derbyshire Collieries. I think I can say, without any doubt what- ever, that this purchase will be a valuable addition to our coal property. In order to finance this purchase and other commit- ments of a capital nature the Board have increased the subscribed capital of the company by the issue of 133,852 fully-paid Ordinary shares at the price of 30s per share; these have all been taken up. Another important event, as I see it, is that we have decided that our shares should be officially quoted on the London Stock Exchange; they are among the lead- ing Coal shares of the country, and ought to be properly represented on the share market. COAL AND IRON TRADE The conditions in the coal and iron trade, as indeed in every trade in the country, are at the moment abnormal; any remarks on the general trend during the year under review or on the prospects during this current year would seem to be a waste of time. I may, however, refer to one or two points of general interest which I men- tioned last year, and on which it is hoped further action will be taken after our pre- sent troubles are over. These were:- Co-operation as between districts in sell- ing coal, the export of coal and the distri- bution of coal. I am glad to say that satisfactory pro- gress towards further co-operation in these directions was being made up to the outbreak of war. With regard to the export of coal, the discussions with other exporting countries are, of course, at an end, and it is too early to anticipate what may be done in the future. Since the outbreak of war the supply of coal has been taken over by the Govern- ment, who are using the organisation of the various district selling schemes. It is hoped that there will be as little disturb- ance of the main machinery of the schemes as is practicable. COMPANY'S GOOD RECORD In the matter of our own affairs I had it in mind to give a short survey of the past history of Sheepbridge during the long period in which I had been personally associated with the company, but I shall leave that for another occasion; one general statement may, however, be of interest. While we have maintained very satis- factory dividends during the past years, it has always been the policy of the directors to reserve a fair proportion of the profits for the purpose of development, with the result that, though we have during the past mined an immense amount of coal, which, of course, cannot be re- placed. we have, with the help of our large interest in the two very excellent coal properties of the Y.A.C. and Newstead and the development of our own royalties, enough coal to last us for very many years to come. If this fact is kept in mind, as you examine the financial resources dis- closed in our balance-sheet, you will realise that our future prospects are good. BALANCE-SHEET Now for the balance-sheet. I shall only deal with important changes. At the date of the balance-sheet we had received Â£122,510 on account, of the new Ordinary shares, which do not rank for dividend for the year under review. We have included in the accounts the total cost of new railway wagons, which accounts for the increase in the sundry creditors. This item and the purchase of Babbington Collieries account largely for the increase in the plant account. We are continuing to spend money on renewals, and it is proposed to set aside a further Â£30,000 out of profits. Our sub- sidiary company is extending its business and we have taken additional shares. There is a marked decrease in stocks owing principally to sales of pig-iron, and debts due to the company show an increase of Â£121,000 owing to the improved trade at the latter end of the year. In the profit and loss account, while the gross profit shows a decrease of Â£22,435, the reduction in the net profit is only Â£15,374, due principally to a reduction in debenture interest. The directors' proposals are shown in their report. I am very glad to feel that we can with complete confidence recommend this satis- factory dividend to the shareholders. It in undear 70 ner cent. of our net profits, t u o c c t 1 t I J r j 1 1 and our financial position is very strong. I cannot with any advantage make any forecast about the current year; so far our results are satisfactory. I can, however say this, as a company we are doing all we can to assist the Government in the present situation. Before I close I want to say a word about additional uses. for our coal after these troubles are over. Before the present intensive production of war material there was a difficulty in finding markets for coke, and this difficulty was increasing; we, at Sheepbridge, are interested not as coke makers, hut as suppliers of the coal. South Yorkshire Coke Makers and others have, wisely, been considering what can be done to meet this difficulty when the abnormal demand slackens and they have been investigating the use of coke for the production of oil. As any plant will take a year or two to erect, the matter ought not to be post- poned, all possible preparation should be continued now so as to be ready when the slump comes. Ladies and gentlemen, I close with a word about those who work for us. I think that our success is due in great measure to the feeling, which undoubtedly exists, of friendly co-operation between the directors, the staff and the men, and I should like to thank all of them, on your behalf, for their work as a team in the interests of the company. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted and a final dividend declared, making 12% per cent. for the year. ...... ..",

   "text_content" : "The third ordinary general meeting of the Cannock Associated Collieries, Ltd., was held yesterday at the company's offices, Bridgtown, Cannock. MR. WILLIAM H. HARRISON (chairman of the company) said: The year has been a difficult one in many respects The third ordinary general meeting of the Cannock Associated Collieries, Ltd., was held yesterday at the company's offices, Bridgtown, Cannock. MR. WILLIAM H. HARRISON (chairman of the company) said: The year hao been a difficult one in many respects heavy demands for certain sizes and qualities running with a perceptible decline of other grades. Fortunately, with a central selling staff and complete co- ordination between our constituent com- panies, producing an increasing efficiency in the underground workings, the effect of these conditions has been negatived, and we were actually able to slightly increase our sales, and substantially improve our results, as compared with the previous year. Under the selling schemes now in opera- tion prices remained steady throughout the year, and there were no general increases in the rates for industrial or public utility fuel. The results obtained, therefore, under the conditions that prevailed are a source of real satisfaction to me, and augur well for a future that must bring with it even more exacting conditions. Another feature has been that under the new wages agreement the wages paid to the men have been consistently higher, while in the year under review an atten- dance bonus (which is generally referred to as holidays with pay), varying from Â£3 to a married man to Â£1 for a boy, has also been paid. The increase in our wages bill for the year was over Â£57,000. On the other hand, we were fortunate in being able to avail ourselves of lower prices for pit props (which are such a considerable item in colliery costs) and general stores. DEPRECIATION AND TAXATION Depreciation of fixed assets, including wagons and properties, has been main- tained in the accounts of the constituent companies, in accordance with the policy outlined at the first meeting of your com- pany; Â£10,209 has been added to the amortisation account, and ample provision has been made for taxation. The whole of the profits of the con- stituent companies, after the above pro- visions, have been declared as dividends, and, as a matter of incidental interest, each company has made its contribution to the improvement in the profit. With regard to our current assets: I need not remind you of the conditions that have prevailed following the realisation that the Munich policy had not achieved the objects for which we so sincerely hoped. The utter deterioration of international rela- tionships has caused investments to depre- ciate far below their nominal, and, as I think you will agree, their intrinsic value. The bulk of our investment holding is in British securities, and, despite the strain to which British credit may be subjected, it can be relied upon to meet its obligations. I would again like to point out our ex- ceptionally strong position in current assets. This policy is being maintained in view of the fact that we hold large areas of coal yet to be developed for which these resources would be readily available. We have also in mind utilising them in further- irig the aim of mutual agreements for amalgamations in the coalfield. CONSERVATIVE DIVIDEND POLICY Until the time arrives for beneficially utilising these resources, however, we con- sider that it would not be in accordance with the conservative policy of your com- pany (which is a continuation of the policy previously adopted by the constituent companies) to ignore even the possibility of their depreciation at the time when they may be required, and we have therefore proposed a transfer to our general reserve of Â£55,588, bringing the total reserve under this heading to Â£100,000. While this procedure necessitates a re- duction in the dividend of 1 per cent. for the year, the directors feel that our share- holders will agree that a policy which takes care of the future well being and stability of the company is obviously sound, and that their action will be approved. Your directors recommend, therefore, the payment of a final dividend on the Ordi- nary shares of 6 per cent., less tax, making 9 per cent. for the year, and the carrying forward to next account of Â£39,038, as com- pared with Â£29,509 brought into this year's accounts. I had intended to refer in some detail to the proposals of the Coal Commission under Part II of the 1938 Coal Act, for the further amalgamation of interests in the coal-mining industry. The state of war in which we now find ourselves, must, however put this matter into abeyance for the present, so I will con- tent myself by saying that we appreciated the willingness with which the Commission promised to receive representations from the district. Sir Ernest Gowers courteously granted an interview to the coalowners of the Cannock Chase district recently, and while your directors are as strongly opposed as ever to compulsory amalgama- tions which, for various reasons, can only. in the ultimate, be inimical to the trade, they will, when more settled conditions are again prevalent, give their careful con- sideration and co-operation to any sugges- tions that are beneficial for this important industry to which so many of us are attached by family tradition and life-long association. ALL RESOURCES AT NATION'S DISPOSAL In the meantime, our country is at war, and the task of all trading concerns is to ensure that, so far as is possible, a steady output of those commodities that are vital to the nation's needs are forthcoming. Coal occupies an important place in this category, as will be recognised clearly by everybody. We have been advised of, and readily accept, the control of timber and other aaanntinl stores. in the hone that. whatever difficulties may need surm~ounting, it may be possible to ensure that our pits are kept equipped, so as to increase production as will undoubtedly be required. On the other hand, our distribution of available coal supplies will be under con- trol, while all wagons have been requisi- tioned and placed into a common pool for allocation as needed. Inconvenience is bound to be caused to suppliers and con- sumers alike, but-we are at war and again I shall be voicing an unanimous opinion, whether of shareholders, employees or cus- tomers; there is only one thing to occupy our attention and that is to use every re- source we have for the maintenance of our contribution to the country's effort, and so ensure a successful issue to the present conflict. We know we can rely upon the' full co- operation of the management, staff and workpeople, to whom, on your behalf, I would convey our thanks for their work during the past year. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted. The directors proposed that a donation of 500 guineas be voted to the Lord Mayor's Red Cross Fund, which was heartily endorsed by the shareholders,",

Dorman and Co. was held yesterday in Stafford. MR. S. M. WILFORD (the chairman) said: We meet to-day under the shadow of war, with our minds somewhat disturbed by our hopes and fears, and the demands on our time and service increasing day by day. The net profit of Â£21,125 shows an in- crease over the previous year of Â£1,058, which your directors consider satisfactory in view of the September crisis and other disturbing conditions. Gross profit is down by Â£1,280, due to keen selling prices and the September crisis. The loan from the bank has been reduced by Â£4.640. The Second Mortgage deben- ture stock shows a slight reduction of Â£100, and Five per Cent. notes at Â£76,000 are the same. The creditors are up by Â£2,117, but this is more than accounted for by an increase of Â£2,554 in the reserve for taxation. The balance of profit carried forward is down by Â£749 after transferring Â£15,000 to general reserve. Goodwill at Â£11,000, trade-marks, etc., at Â£5,000 and freehold land and buildings at Â£74,000 are the same as the previous year. Plant, machinery, tools, etc., are up by Â£1,212 through addi- tional purchases. Stock-in-trade is down by Â£13,924. Debtors are up by Â£7,950, and cash at bank and in hand is up by Â£16,410. The report shows how it is proposed to deal with the balance of profit available at 31st March last which was Â£19,317 12s 9d. Your directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 12%2 per cent. (less tax) on the Ordinary shares for the year to 31st March, 1939, requiring Â£3,687 10s, and that the balance of Â£8,755 2s 9d be carried forward. BOARD'S FINANCIAL POLICY At a time like this, when the company is faced with the possibility of great changes in its activities and earning power, it is desirable that working capitaj shall be conserved as much as possible to ensure that the company's growth and develop- ment will not be hindered. At the same time, it is essential that the economic machine shall not be retarded for want of fuel, which must be provided by means of dividends. Your directors have therefore chosen a cautious but nevertheless helpful policy by transferring Â£15,000 to general reserve and recommending the payment of a small dividend on the Ordinary shares, the first for many years. There will be in the ensuing year a heavy charge for air raid precautions. In addition, the company will have to meet the cost of war risks insurance, which will undoubtedly be a considerable sum. During the year under review there was an increase in the quantity and value of the sales, but the slight fall of Â£1,280 in the gross profit reflects the keenness of selling prices and the difficulties of produc- tion during the crisis of September last. There has been a further increase in the value of the company's sales during the first six months of the current year. and the value of the orders on the books at the present time is greater than at the same time last year. The Board has been strengthened by the appointment of Mr. J. H. Gladstone, B.Sc., as a special director of the company. With the outbreak of war, business con- ditions must obviously be rearranged, but it is too early for us to know what will be expected from us. Last year I referred to the happy relationship which existed between our employees and the manage- ment. Trade conditions have not been easy, but I am glad to have this oppor- tunity of publicly thanking them on your behalf, as well as on my own, for their part in making the year under review so successful. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted.",

   "text_content" : "DIVIDEND OF 15% The twenty-eighth ordinary general meeting of Parit-Bruas (Malay) Rubber Company, Ltd., was held yesterday at 136, Vidtoria-street, S.W. MR. A. J. STEVENS, M.A. (the chair- man), said: The recommendation of a final dividend making 15 per cent. for the year, after Â£800 has been added to \"General reserve\" and Â£943 written off \"Buildings,\" is proof that a good year's work has been accomplished in none too easy times. I should, however, point out that as against the Â£800 put to general reserve there was a corresponding drop in the value of our investments as at 30th June last. Our assessment for the year 1938 was 1,054,000 Ibs and for the year 1939 has been increased by 82,000 Ibs up to 1,136,000 Ibs, also that for our financial year our average quota was only 47% per cent., naturally involving some increase in the cost of production. Thanks, however, to careful work in the East, our all-in cost was kept as Idw as about 4%!d per pound. Our sale price reached the satisfactory average of 9.14d per pound. For the cur- rent year with the release up to 70 per cent. and, at the moment, an improved price, we are in a position to face the extra expenses caused by the international situation. Close attention is being paid to all departments of the estate work, build- ings kept in repair and more up-to-date coolie lines have been erected. No useful comment can be made by me on the general outlook. It is so easy to \"opine \" when one is uninformed, and the future is too problematical; so instead of talking it is better to work as hard as pos- sible, to accept cheerfully the burdens that will be laid upon us, to hope for the best. and to abstain from captious criticism. Report and accounts were adopted.",

   "text_content" : "The annual general meeting of E. W. Tarry and Co., Ltd., was held yesterday at Soutnern House, E.C. SIR J. FORTESCUE FLANNERY, Bt., D.L. (the chairman), said that we were now at war in the interests of humanity, and the difficulties of successful trading were im- measurably increased. The results of the year previous to the one now to be con- sidered had been exceptionally good and it could hardly be expected that, having regard to world events, the year now under review would show an equally favourable result. Taking everything into considera- tion, it had been a difficult year from a trading point of view. The main reasons for the decline in business in Johannesburg were restricted buying by the mining popu- lation, less development work by new mines and the fact that building activities had slowed down considerably. A new catalogue had been circulated and had been instrumental in their obtaining orders from as far afield as East Africa and South West Africa. Owing to im- provements and rearrangements at the Austral Works they were now ready -to cope with more work when it was avail- able. The farming community now formed the bulk of the Kimberley business and they were concentrating on that branch of the colony's activities. The net profit was Â£30,249, a decrease of Â£14,449 compared with the record figure of the previous year. Having regard to the very difficult period they had experi- enced, he felt that the result could not be regarded as too disappointing. It was proposed to pay a dividend of 6 per cent. ' on the Ordinary shares. It was useless to forecast the future, but. up to the present their sales in the current year were prac- tically the same as for the same period of the previous year. The report was unanimously adopted.' ,. |",
