   "text_content" : "By Paul Bells, Aerospace Correspondent BRITISH AEROSPACE, one of the UK's biggest manufactur- ing groups, yesterday announced a sharp fall in prof- its and launched its first rights issue since privatisation. The interim pre-tax profits of Â£86m, compared with Â£146m in the first half of 1990, and the company's full-year forecast of Â£150m profits before excep- tional items were even worse than expected after BAe's warning only on Monday. BAe shares fell another 63p to close at 445p, the lowest level in two years. They have fallen 105p since last Friday. Sentiment among BAe's institutional shareholders has been soured by the company's failure to keep them abreast of its deteriorating profits posi- tion and by the clumsy han- dling of the rights issue, which was leaked last week. The Stock Exchange said yesterday it was investigating a spate of leaks about recent rights issues. BAe's two-for-five issue at s80p per share will raise Â£432m to fund the development and restructuring of its four core businesses: defence, commer- cial aircraft, motor vehicles (through Rover Group) and property and construction. All were hit by recession or defence spending cuts. For the full year, BAe will report its first net loss since 1987 because of a Â£250m excep- tional provision to cover the cost of rationallsation. The severe difficulties of the UK aerospace and engineering industry will be further high- lighted today when Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine Editorial Commnnt.Page 20 Le................................ Page 22 Clumsy asempt at passing the hat................ Page 23 Details............................. Page 24 manufacturer, is expected to report a sharp fall in first-half profits. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said yesterday the group had decided to take the Â£250m in \"one hit\". BAe has already spent Â£450m on restructuring since 1966. It intends to spend another Â£800m this year, and Â£220m in 1998 and 1998, Mr Evans said. BAe warned of further ration- alisation of its plants on top of closures already in progress. Mr Evans said BAe would no longer consider entering on its own any completely new air- craft development pro. grammes. It was looking for international partners for its regional aircraft operations. He said the European Airbus consortium, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, would become a \"key area\" for the company as Airbus expands. The Airbus programme would require substantial increases in working capital to support the sharp increase in produc- tion rate. This was one of the reasons BAe was now seeking fresh funds from the market. BAe had hoped to use profits generated from its property operations to help fund its restructuring and transforma- tion, but the slump in the UK property market has forced it to make the provisions in the BdtMah AmupaCe Shminpr - -noe) 560 540 520 500 480 460 2 September 1991 11 Source:oastream second half of this year. First-half turnover rose from Â£4.79bn to Â£4.89bn. Despite the fall in profits, BAe maintained its interim dividend at 8.9p and forecast an unchanged final of 16.lp. Defence continued to account for the lion's share of profits with a trading profit of Â£273m, up Â£96m from the same period last year. But BAe warned of the difficulties sac- ing the defence sector. Commercial aircraft showed a Â£16m trading loss while Rover also was in the red to the tune of Â£45m. The Â£45m cost of withdrawing Rover's Sterling model from the US market will be charged as an extraordinary item in the sec- ond half. Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman said BAe's prob- lems showed that the UK man- ufacturing sector could not cope with changes in defence policy on its own."

Mr Gorbachev made the announcement at a press con- ference after several hours o talks in Moscow with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, who in turn descrlb the move as \"a very substan tial gesture\".

   "article_dc_title" : "Soviets Send Plea for Massive EC Food Aid",
   "text_content" : "By David Buchan and John Lloyd in Moscow and David Gardner in Strasbourg seretary UK mwS, aUrr to the Baltic republics is I moUcow THE SOVIET authorities have sent an urgent request to the European Community for mas- sive food aid starting next month and continuing through the winter until the middle of next year. The request reveals the fears of the Soviet leaders that the fragile democratic changes may be threatened by a break- down of social order if the pop ulation faces hunger. The plea was made on Mon- day by Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, before his reported resignation last night as chairman of the Com- mittee for the Management of the National Economy in a sur- prise announcement. In a letter to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission presi- dent, Mr Silayev asks for aid worth between Ecu5bn (f3.49bn) and Ecu6bn. The list of commodities requested ranges from 5.5m tonnes of grain to 45bn ciga- rettes. Mr Delors, addressing the European parliament in Stras- bourg yesterday, did not refer to the request, but said the EC must commit at least $2bn (1l.lObn) worth of food instantly - and that non-EC countries should follow its example. He proposed buying produce from the struggling economies of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia \"so that we can achieve two objectives in one go\". EC officials said the plan included the Ecul.l5bn in food and technical aid already being processed. Mr Delors said food must reach the shops to ensure social peace. Mr Delors pointedly invited the US, Janan, and Canada - Silayev resigns....... Page 2 Yavlinsky sees early pact on economic union..Page 2 Shevardnadze book review.................. Page 20 the non-EC members of the Group of Seven leading indus- trialised nations - to sub- scribe to the loan. The Commission president referred to the EC's dispropor- tionate role in providing west- ern aid and credit to the Soviet Union and east Europe, for which he implied the G7 took the credit. \"We can't keep on baking the cake by ourselves and leaving it to others to put the cherry on top,\" he said. In Moscow, bilateral discus- sions between Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and Soviet and Russian leaders, focused on food and economic assistance to the Soviet Union, but made no fresh promises of aid on Wash- ington's behalf. Mr Gorbachev said after meeting Mr Baker that their talks had centred on the need to produce an immediate and credible economic reform pro- gramme for the Soviet Union which could be discussed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Robert Mauthner, Diplo- matic Editor, writes: Britain is in favour of providing food aid to the Soviet Union, as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secre- tary, made clear after seeing Mr Gorbachev in Moscow on Tuesday. Though officials said it was too early to comment on Mr Delors' specific proposal, they said they would first have to assess whether the problem was one of physical food short- ages or due to the old failures of the distribution system. Britain was mobilising what Mr Hurd called \"a formidable force\" of officials and leading food company representatives to study the situation. Christopher Parkes writes from Bonn: German Chancel- lor Helmut Kohl, noting that his country gave generously to help the Soviet Union through the winter last year, promised that it would do the same this year. He offered his personal backing for any international humanitarian aid scheme at a meeting with Mr Alexander Yakovlev, an adviser to Mr Gorbachev. However, he told Mr Yakov- lev that before a long-term aid programme to support the eco- nomic reform process could be agreed a clear means of deter- mining accountability was needed. Most important, he said, was clarification of the competence of the republics and that of the Soviet Union. ruru nÂ·a~ vr Â·ur vv~r~~ r~~~l~Â·",

   "text_content" : "By Kovin Done and John Griffiths in Frankfurt and William Dawkins in Paris JAPAN and the European Community appear to be head- ing into a damaging dispute over interpreting the details of last month's deal with the European Commission on the trade in cars in the EC after 1992. Mr Yutaka Kume, chief exec- utive of Nissan Motor and pres- ident of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, said yesterday that Japan had not agreed to any limit on the production of Japanese cars in Europe. His statement contrasted with the EC's understanding. When the deal was announced at the end of July, Brussels made clear that it had esti- mated that the output of Japa- nese cars and light commercial vehicles in Europe would be allowed to rise to 1.2m a year by the end of the decade. Mr Kume said yesterday at the Financial Times World Motor Industry Conference in Frankfurt that the figure of 1.2m vehicles for transplant production - Japanese plants in Europe - was \"not a figure Continued on Page 22 Japan trade surplas, Page 6 7T motor conference, Page 8 Observer, Page 20 Japan and EC Cont.nued ro Pac we have agreed between Japan and the EC. \"This is the EC's unilateral, internal assumption.

The fig ure of 1.2m is a unilateral expression of EC expectations.\" In an interview he said: \"There is talk in some quarters of a limit of 1.2m, but that is not the kind of thing that will bind the Japanese side.\" If such a cealling were to be aimple mented, that would be tanta- mount to an overall restriltmon, and we are quite opposed to this kind of restricto.\" Mr Dimn uqu Straurahan, the French du inister, warned yesterday tan o- Sviit to o that the Jap a ew -a w 1010 to try to M he uw - \"rope --copor a *er th MC *ar- ket was freed from import curbs in 1999.

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson and John Lloyd in Moscow MR Ivan Silayev, put in charge of the Soviet economy after the failed coup last month, has abruptly announced that he will resign next week. His surprise decision came as Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the radical economist and member of Mr Silayev's four-man com- mittee acting as the Soviet gov- ernment, predicted that an eco- nomic treaty between the former Soviet republics could be signed within six weeks. Mr Silayev, who is also the Russian prime minister, said on his appointment as chair- man of the Committee for the Management of the National Economy, that he would give up that post within a few weeks. His decision yesterday appears to have pre-empted his own deadline. According to Interfax news agency, Mr Silayev announced his resignation during a discus- sion of the rights and powers of the committee. He is said to have argued with a report by Mr Yuri Luzkhov, one of the committee's four members, which said that the decrees passed by Russian leaders after the coup were an unprece- dented usurpation of the republic's rights. Mr Silayev is reported to have argued that Russia did no more than other republics. Whatever the cause of Mr Silayev's decision, its timing is surprising and, for the west, unsettling. The interim committee, which Mr Silayev said he would only leave when more permanent structures had been set up to replace it, is deeply embroiled both in hatching radical plans for economic reform and in persuading the west to provide assistance. Mr Yavlinsky said that only through signing a treaty cen- tralising monetary and budget- ary control could the republics emerge from the deepening economic crisis. He has produced a draft eco- nomic treaty, now being dis- cussed by the republics, which lays down a banking union, a common currency, a common servicing of debt and the shar- ing of a common economic space with free movement of labour, capital, goods and ser- vices. The agreement is by far the toughest of the various eco- nomic pacts now on offer - though Mr Yavlinsky insisted that there was \"no competi- tion\" between the different plans. It lays down that former Soviet republics which do not wish to join the economic union would be treated as for- eign states. A negotiation between the member states and those not joining would be concluded within three months of the signing of the treaty. So far, the Baltic republics have said they will not join, though all are anxious to sign bilateral treaties. However, faced with paying world prices for oil and other raw materials provided by Russia, they may be forced to rethink. Mr Yavlinsky emphasised that the critical nature of the republics' economies dictated tight central monetary and budget control - saying that production had fallen by 15-16 per cent since the beginning of the year, inflation was running at between 2-3 per cent a week and oil production was expec- ted to drop by 20 per cent by the end of the year. The essence of Mr Yavlin- sky's draft is a co-ordinated and relatively rapid shift to market relations. Article eight of the draft says that \"member states of the economic union recognise that private property and freedom of enterprise are the basis of the development of the economy. They will create conditions facilitating business activities and limiting the scope of state interference\". Those signing the treaty would agree to remove cus- toms barriers which many have erected, and to guarantee free flow of goods, services and labour. Mr Yavlinsky's draft says that \"member states recognise the benefits of pres- erving the rouble as a common currency in a single monetary system\" - however, it allows the creation of republic curren cies (already under way) but only if they do not harm the union monetary system. A banking union would be set up, with the functions of a reserve bank for the central banks of the member states. It would control the emission of money, define discount and interest rates, control the activities of commercial banks and control the gold and hard currency reserves of the mem- ber states. It also pledges the member republics to co-ordinate their budgetary and tax policies and to agree limits to the internal debts - now ballooning out of control at both union and gov- ernment levels.

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Moscow THE European Commission yesterday warned Moscow it must stabilise hyper-inflation in the Soviet Union, and partic- ularly the Russian republic, if it is to draw real benefit from the Ecul.l5bn (Â£800m) aid pledged by the EC. After talks with Mr Yevgeny Saburov, the Russian econom- ics minister, a senior EC offi- cial. said- the Commission's message was: \"For God's sake, take your monetary stabilisa- tion seriously. There is no hope of holding other republics in the rouble monetary area, unless Russia tackles stabilisa- tion.\" The mechanics of the EC's aid programme, agreed before last month's abortive coup, are largely unaffected by the latest changes in the Soviet Union's political structure. The visiting EC team, led by Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, made no commitment on requests for further aid, beyond telling Soviet and Rus- sian ministers that the EC would insist on thorough justi- fication for extra demands for grain, sugar and potatoes. The Andriessen team was caught unawares by Mr Jac- ques Delors' proposal for the west to spend at least $2bn (El.lbn) on buying food from eastern Europe to feed the Soviet Union this winter. The Commission is very keen on so-called \"triangular\" deals, helping eastern Europe and the Soviet Union at the same time. However, the prac- tice has got off to a bad start, with the discovery that much of the 100,000 tonnes of Hun- garian grain which the Com- mission announced last week it was buying to feed Albania had gone bad. At the Conference on Secu- rity and Co-operation in Europe this week, Mr Andries- sen complained strongly to the Hungarian foreign minister, Mr Geza Jeszensky. The Commission has care- fully inspected the production and delivery of its own special food aid, mainly milk powder and baby food, to the Soviet Union. Some 5,000 tonnes have been delivered so far. A further 95,000 tonnes of specially pack- aged food is to follow. EC officials say the recently- established special office for EC technical assistance in Moscow, which will soon have Commission accountants work- ing in it, can be expanded to include representatives from individual Soviet republics. They say preparation for EC technical aid to the energy sec- tor, which covers fossil fuels and nuclear power, is far advanced, and Brussels is ready to start next month com- mitting money for projects. In all, the EC has received 200 project proposals for the five areas to be covered by Community technical aid. The proposals have come from indi- vidual enterprises, trade asso- ciations, scientific institutes as well as from republican gov- ernments.",

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York SOVIET officials seeking a foreign investor for VAZ, the country's largest car manufac- turer, are holding talks with US components manufacturers on possible investments in VAZ's parts suppliers. The Soviets want a single foreign investor to take a stake of at least 30 per cent in VAZ, which produces the Lada car. They have held discussions with Flat of Italy since early this year. Flat, advised by Mor- gan Grenfell, the British mer- chant bank, set up VAZ's main plant at Togliattigrad in the Russian republic more than 20 years ago. The Soviet team said in New York yesterday that VAZ's components suppliers were also seeking foreign partners. Mr Yuri Levin, who heads a consulting firm advising on the privatisation of VAZ, said it was a sign of the dramatic change in the Soviet economic environment that VAZ's com- ponents suppliers had been asking. \"When are you coming to privatise us?\" Mr Brian Murray of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank advising the Soviets on the VAZ privatisation, said it was too early to say how many Soviet components businesses might be involved. He added that while Flat clearly had a head start in negotiations over a stake in VAZ itself, it did not have a complete lock on that deal. Informal expressions of interest had been received from other western car manu- facturers, including feelers from the US but not from Japan. Mr Murray said Bear Stearns was still completing its valua- tion of the Soviet company. A decision on its foreign partner might be reached during the next three to four months. Mr Rair Simonyan, head of the Soviet centre for foreign investment and privatisation, said the VAZ deal, the coun- try's first significant privatisa- tion, might be considered a showcase for the whole econ- omy. He said last month's coup attempt had served to speed up economic eforIm, and in this privatisation and foreign Invetment were priorities.

   "text_content" : "ON a sliver of land sandwiched uncomfortably between the Ukraine and the river Dniestr lies the final bastion of the Soviet Union. The Dniestrian Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia declared indepen- dence a fortnight ago, still loyal to the Union if not to the republic of Moldova from which it seceded, or to the new power in Moscow. The country's quaint title, its population of a mere 700,000, and their mission to guard the Soviet flame, alone if needs be, invite ridicule. The only sites in the generally dull capital of Tiraspol are amusing throwbacks - the statues of Lenin and exhortatory slogans which remain untouched. But the Dniestrians' fight to secede from Moldova is no laughing matter. Three died in the Dniestrian town of Dubos- sary last autumn after a show of force by Moldovan volunteer paramilitaries. Mr Igor Smirnov, the Dnies trian president, is imprisoned in Kishinev, the Moldovan cap ital, on charges of supporting last month's failed Soviet coup. Women demanding his release blockaded two railway links, at one point cutting off much of Moldova's trade. Ominously, the Dniestr authorities have threatened to cut supplies of electricity from the mini state's two large power stations in the event of Moldovan aggression. The rhetoric has become heated too. The Dniestrians are \"Stalinist\" and the Moldovans \"fascistS\". Mr Valeri Litskay, the chief Dniestr spokesman, describes he arrest of Mr Smirnov as \"the first act of the war.\" It is a war, he adds, in which cutting electricity supplies would be the equivalent of using nuclear wempons - a last resort. The root of the matter is that the Dniestrians refuse to be rta of a Moldova dominated by Romanian nationalists and moving towards unification with neighbouring Romania. The people of Dniestr are a roughly equal mix of Russians, Ukrainians and Moldovans (Romanian-speaking). They are so ethnically and culturally homogenised that many see themselves as \"Soviet people\". As such - and they are not unique in this - they have no place among the nations re- emerging from the Soviet state. \"We have one motherland, the Soviet Union. There are no nations here,\" says Mrs Raisa Martinenko, one of the women railway protestors at Tiraspol. \"Here is the Soviet Union; Russian minority in Moldova there will be a Soviet Union again,\" says another. Their loyalties are matched by the colours of the Tiraspol blockade - the orange of a weathered Soviet flag and the red and green of their Soviet Socialist Republic. Mr Litskay, himself of mixed Ukrainian, Moldovan and Rus- sian parentage, puts the argu- ment. \"We have to keep the old traditions,\" he says, explaining the Dniestr republic's oldfash- ioned name and the preserva- tion of communist symbols. \"In Moscow, they are returning to Russian culture. We can't do that because we are a multina- tional state.\" Opponents of this view point out that the ethnic mix is a Soviet creation. Indeed the Dnlestr strip is of Soviet design. After the Soviet Union took Moldova from Romania during the second world war, it attached the eastern bank of the Dniestr river to the new republic to dilute its predomi- nantly Romanian population. The district was to be the instrument by which Moscow ruled its new territory. It was also a district in which Presi- dent Leonid Brezhnev took a personal interest. Military installations and industrial investment were concentrated on the eastern bank. So much so that the dis- trict, with 17 per cent of Mol- dova's population and 12 per cent of its area, made up 30 per cent of its industrial produc- tion. Mr Yuri Bogdanov, the Rus- sian leader of Moldova's reformist Democratic Move- ment estimates that half of Tir- aspol's inhabitants are military or former military personnel and their dependents. The pol- icy has left the Dniestr shore inhabited by \"homo Sovieti- cus\", says Mr Bogdanov. In 1972, on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet Union, Mr Brezhnev proudly proclaimed the cre- ation of the Soviet people. Many Dniestrians have their own personal examples to dem- onstrate the absurdity of join- ing any nation state. Mrs Anna Orlova has three adopted chil- dren, of Jewish, Moldovan and Russian origin. Say which country to join, she challenges. Four card-playing students at Tlraspol University turn out to be a Russian, a Ukrainian, a Bulgarian and a Greek, all of whom describe themselves as Soviet. Although the logic of geography says that they should Join the Ukraine, emo- tionally it Is not that simple. \"They have nowhere to go,\" says Mr Bogdanov.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0912_0002_007",
   "text_content" : "By Chritysa Free Und in Kiev THE Ukrainian parliament is working on a draft law which would dismantle all stationary nuclear weapons in the repub- lic and transfer all mobile ones to Russia. If the bill, to be debated by the full parliament later this month, becomes law it will go a long way toward reassuring the world community that the collapse of the Soviet Union need not increase the risk of nuclear war. Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan are the only republics with nuclear war- heads on their territory. The Ukrainians are also ask- ing for a say in the way the stationary weapons are dis- mantled, hoping that this will give them a seat at talks which have been confined until now to the US and the Soviet Union. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chair- man of the parliamentary com- mission on foreign affairs and one of the architects of the leg- islation, is proposing that the 200 inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) now stationed in the Ukraine be \"liquidated\" as part of the 400 ICBMs which the Soviet Union agreed to dis- mantle in the arms pact signed in Moscow in July by President George Bush and President Mikhail Gorbachev. \"We must show the world that democratisation and the disintegration of the empire bring disarmament,\" said Mr Pavlychko. The mobile missiles are already being transferred to Russia, in accordance with a joint communique signed by the Ukraine and Russia in August. Russia, according to Mr Boris Yeltsin, already con- trols 70 per cent of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons capacity. For greater international impact, Mr Pavlychko hopes the legislation can be steered through parliament by the end of the month when Mr Leonid Kravchuk, head of the Ukrai- nian government, is to give a speech at the United Nations in New York. Thanks to Stalin's machinations, the Ukraine is one of the founding members of the United Nations and is represented there by its own ambassador. In the aftermath of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl five years ago the Ukraine has developed an influential \"green\" movement and a strong popular aversion to all things atomic. As early as last summer, when the Ukraine declared its sovereignty, the second most powerful Soviet republic announced that it intended to become \"a nuclear free zone\". As independence becomes a reality, there has been specula- tion that the Ukraine govern- ment might try to use the nuclear weapons on its terri- tory as a bargaining chip in the international arena, espe- cially with a fully armed and possibly irredentist Russia as its neighbour. Some deputies, including Mr Viacheslav Chornovil, a lead- ing presidential candidate, are opposed to handing the mobile missiles to Russia. But even Mr Chornovil, in a statement yes- terday, insisted that the Ukraine should become a nuclear-free zone. Freedom of movement pledged FOR the first time in centuries Soviet citizens and foreigners are to be allowed to travel freely, AP reports from Moscow. Mr Boris Pankin, the foreign minister, yesterday announced measures ranging from prison reform to political prisoners and preventing inter-ethnic conflicts in a speech at a con- ference sponsored by the Coun- cil on Security and Co-opera- tion in Europe (CSCE). The Soviet Union will speed implementation of a law to allow free emigration and immigration, he said. The law had been due to become fully operational in 1993. Its adop- tion was a condition set by the US and other western nations before they agreed to Moscow hosting the CSCE. Mr Pankin said the govern- ment would also review cases of Soviet citizens denied per- mission to emigrate. The right to travel any- where, however, may not translate into the right to live anywhere. Soviet citizens still need a residence permit. US trade offer to Baltics Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, said yesterday that Washington would soon normalise trade links with the three Baltic states and give them Most Favoured Nation status, Reuter reports. Nations with Most Favoured Nation status receive the same low tariffs the US gives to its best trading partners. * The Soviet defence minis- ter says Moscow is not ready to pull its troops out of the Baltic states until after 1994, the head of Latvia's parliamentary defence committee said yester- day, Beater reports from Riga. But Latvian Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis said he had told the defence minister, Yev- geny Shaposhnikov, the troops should be withdrawn as quickly as possible.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington PRESIDENT George Bush will play host to many world lead- ers seeking his views on how the US intends to respond to the revolutionary changes in the Soviet Union. Some, like Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the Polish prime minister, will command more attention than others. Mr Bielecki has a simple message to the west: the US preoccupation with the Soviet Union should not obscure the pressing needs of the emerging democracies in eastern Europe, particularly Poland. This is not a plea for cash, as Mr Bielecki made clear during an interview on the eve of yes- terday's meeting with Presi- dent Bush. On the contrary, the former economics lecturer from Gdansk university is determined to show that his government is serious about privatisation, reform of the banking system and other vital if painful steps toward a mar- ket economy. He merely wants the US and the rest of the world to deal with a sense of proportion toward what he calls \"the for- mer Soviet Union\". \"We can't discuss huge financial assis- tance to the Soviet Union,\" he says, \"but we cannot forget about food aid this winter. We will provide assistance our- selves, with the Group of Seven industrialised nations.\" Caught historically between the great powers of Russia and Germany, Poland faces the prospect of being sandwiched between a prosperous but unwelcoming EC to the west and poor, unstable sovereign Soviet republics to the east. Mr Blelecki says he is wor- ried about mass Soviet emigra- tion into Poland if serious food shortages develop this winter. He is pressing for closer ties with the Nato alliance, and he criticises the EC for failing to open up its markets to eastern European countries seeking to break free from communism. \"We need better access, there is a lot of protectionism, espe- cially EC subsidies, quotas and tariff barriers.\" This talk is guaranteed a sympathetic audience in the US. But Mr Bielecki, who was appointed by President Lech Walesa nine months ago, says he recognises that support will depend on the next stage of economic reform, particularly privatisation. Although Mr Bielecki has been accused of going slow, he blames opposition from the runmp of communist deputies in the Polish parliament who should be rooted out in next month's elections. He remains cautious, however, on \"mass privatisation\", predicting instead a sell-off of 100 rather than the earlier figure of 400 state enterprises. Another target is the Polish banking system. Mr Bielecki says many banks have refused to apply proper credit stan- dards. The remedy: technical advice from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and \"twinning\" partner- ships with western banks. Mr Jan Krnyztof Bielecki, prime minister of Poland (right), with Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF chief, in Washington yesterday",

   "text_content" : "NEW DRAFT proposals on European monetary union, to be tabled by Belgium within the next 10 days, will propose loosening some of the strict economic conditions set out in the Dutch presidency's techni- cal paper on Emu, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The Belgian text may also offer weaker EC economies a greater say in the economic decision-making process once stronger countries have achieved full monetary union. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, offered to prepare a new draft text at the end of Monday's ministerial meeting of the intergovernmental conference on Emu, at which Dutch sug- gestions came under fire for increasing the chances of a \"two-speed\" move to monetary union. The Belgian text, which will be tabled before the informal meeting of EC finance minis- ters at Apeldoorn in the Netherlands a week on Satur- day, will try to meet some of those criticisms by proposing that a majority of member states should have to meet objective economic criteria before being allowed to move to full monetary union. The challenge for Belgium - and the Netherlands - which wants to a formal draft treaty o the end of Octo- ber, is to reconcile critics of the two-peed approach with- out backtracking too far from the Dutch paper, which was welcomed by Britain. The Dutch paper envisaged a European Monetary Institute (EMI) for the second, transi- tional phase of Emu, with the European central bank estab- lished after the final decision on monetary union had been taken. Instead of then having two tier of economic institutions Belgium may propose some mesiure of jint decision-nk- ing, with the EMI partly absorbed by the European cen- tral bank.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent in Frankfurt CENTRAL AND eastern Europe are facing \"an acute transformation crisis\", Mr Carl Hahn, the management board chairman of Volkswagen, the biggest European car maker, which is investing heavily in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, warned yesterday. The economic slump facing the region was \"much graver\" than expected by either the OECD or the IMF until recently, he said. The region was not receiving adequate support to restructure from the west, despite \"very courageous steps in the direction of the market economy,\" he told the Financial Times World Motor Industry Conference. Industrial production in these countries, which had already contracted by 15 per cent in 1990, fell by a regional average of 12.7 per cent in real terms in the first quarter of 1991 over last year. \"The alarming decrease in real investments in the region as a whole is estimated at 20 per cent...what is particularly alarming is that industrial pro- duction is falling faster than employment, and sales are fall- ing faster than production. So if production is adapted to sales and employment to pro- duction, then unemployment in these countries must increase dramatically.\" .\"The commitment of the west to date is not sufficient, said Mr Hahn, and the task in central Europe was \"little more than a warm-up exercise\" in comparison with the challenge of the Soviet upheaval. The capital and know-how of the west were faced with \"a complex of tasks such as has never before occurred in the history of the industrialised nations\". Mr Hahn warned that a sharp prosperity divide between western Europe and central and eastern Europe could not be sustained in the long term. \"The Oder-Neisse line must not become the Rio Grande of Europe.\" Western methods could only be successful in the east through private direct invest- ment, provision of capital and know-how and direct involve- ment.

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0912_0004_001",
   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington A FRESH congressional battle is looming over plans to over- haul US banking legislation. Reform bills have passed the banking committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but another committee has submitted a draft severely curtailing pro- posals to allow commercial banks into investment banking activities. The draft bill from the House energy and commerce commit- tee, which has long pressed a claim of jurisdiction over the securities industry, would repeal the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act which rigidly separates commercial and investment banking. However, the bill would place so many curbs on the securities activities of commer- cial banks that it would, in some respects, be even more restrictive than Glass-Steagall. The Treasury Department, which has argued that allow- ing well-capitalised banks to offer a variety of financial ser- vices is necessary to restore the competitiveness of the banking industry, has critic- ised the commerce committee's draft as \"a clear roll-back of current law\". The proposal would reverse some recent relaxations of the Glass-Steagall separation, including the authorisation given to some strong bank holding companies to under- write securities issues. The bills approved by the House and Senate banking committees would permit banks to own securities subsid- iaries, although they would include some \"firewalls\" so that deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor- poration would not be put at risk by these offshoots. The House banking commit- tee's version, unlike the Senate draft, would go further by allowing commercial compa- nies to own banks. This proposal is opposed by Mr John Dingell, chairman of the House energy and com- merce committee, and by Mr Edward Markey, who heads its sub-committee on telecommu- nications and finance. One of the driving forces behind the banking overhaul legislation is the need to replenish the bank insurance fund, which covers depositors in the event of bank failure. The Treasury has been hoping the need to top up the fund would help push through a comprehensive reform of bank legislation. If the separate congressional committees cannot agree on a bill, some legislators may press for the refinancing to be voted through separately, leaving more comprehensive reform for later.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0912_0004_002",
   "text_content" : "HE future shape of Can- ada, and whether Que- bec will be part of it, should become clearer over the next few weeks. The federal government in Ottawa plans to publish before the end of the month its initial blueprint for a deal aimed at spiking separatist ardour in Quebec, while persuading the rest of the country that Canada would be better off with the francophone province than without it. To have any chance of suc- cess the proposals will have to offer something to several dif- ferent - and sometimes antag- onistic - constituencies. The western provinces, where the right-wing Reform party has become a force to be reckoned with, are seeking a louder voice in the federal Sen- ate, and a dilution of official bilingualism. Increasingly impatient native Indians want a mechanism which gives them greater self-government as well as a bigger say in national affairs. The key province of Ontario has recently insisted that constitutional reforms should include a social rights charter. The list goes on. But the key player is undoubtedly Quebec. A clear majority of Quebecois will need to be satisfied with Ott- awa's proposals if Premier Rob- ert Bourassa is to find a way out of his half-hearted commit- ment to holding a referendum on independence by October 1992. Separatist fervour surged last autumn after the collapse of the Meech Lake accord, drawn up in 1987 to persuade Quebec to put its signature to the Canadian constitution. The accord was left unratif- ied by two English-speaking Robert Bourassa: risks fanning separatist flames provinces which were not pre- pared to bow to Quebec's demand that it be recognised as a \"distinct society\" in the constitution, and be given a number of extra powers. Quebec interpreted the demise of Meech Lake, which coincided with anti-French incidents in other parts of the country, as a clear sign they were unloved and unwanted by the rest of Canada. But the mood has changed markedly since then. Mr Marshall Cohen, chief executive of the Molson beer group, observed recently that \"fewer Canadians are shouting at each other, and more are listening to each other\". Support for independence among Quebecois has fallen from 64 per cent last November to less than half now, accord- ing to CROP, a Montreal poll- ing company. Although the separatist Parti Quebecois recently won its first by-election, the party is more on the defensive than it was a year ago. Federalists in Quebec have become more vocal in the past six months than they were in the immediate aftermath of the Meech Lake fiasco. French- speaking business leaders, in particular, have warned that Quebec's economy would sus- ser if it was no longer part of Canada as a whole. The province would probably have to renegotiate the US- Canada free trade agreement for itself. The recession may be another factor; several compa- nies which were in the van- guard of the emergence of an assertive business class in Que- bec in the 1970s and 1980s now find themselves in difficulty. The federalist side received another boost last spring when the enigmatic Mr Bourassa, who for years has carefully avoided making a full commit- ment to federalism, said his preferred strategy was to remain part of Canada - although on his terms. Those terms continue to include the \"distinct society\" formula and a substantial transfer of powers from federal to provincial jurisdiction. Mr Bourassa faces a delicate balancing act. While he may want to keep Quebec in Can- ada, he must have something to show Quebec nationalists. He simply cannot afford to make significant compromises to the rest of the country with- out once again igniting the sep- aratist flames. Even his own Liberal party includes a large, mostly young, group of nationalists. Mr Joe Clark, the federal constitutional affairs minister, has spent the past six months criss-crossing the country patiently listening to every conceivable group's agenda for political reform. The cabinet committee drawing up the gov- ernment's proposals has also made a point of holding its meetings all over the country, including one on Baffin Island in the Arctic. Mr Clark has been widely applauded for smoothing ruf- fled feathers. But he has already warned that, on one point, there is little room for compromise. To have any chance of suc- cess in Quebec, the govern- ment's proposals will once again have to include a \"dis- tinct society\" clause or some- thing just like it. English-Canadians' reaction to that provision will be cru- cial in determining whether Quebec stays or leave",

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto SUCRALOSE, the high-intensity sweetener developed by Tate & Lyle of the UK, was yesterday cleared for distribution in Canada, the first country to give its approval. The clearance allows Tate and its US partner, Johnson & Johnson, to begin an assault on a $l1.2bn (Â£714m) global market dominated by aspar- tame. Sucralose was launched in Canada under the brand name Splenda by Tate's Redpath Specialty Products subsidiary. Mr Peter Eatherley, managing director of UK-based Tate & Lyle Speciality Sweeteners, said he expected the product to garner a \"significant\" slice of the fast-growing Canadian market, now worth about C$25m (Â£12.7m) a year. Tate hopes the approval by the Canadian authorities will spur clearance in the crucial US market, where sucralose is licensed to a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Mr Eatherley said he was optimistic the US Food and Drug Administration would give its approval within the next year, but said approval by the European Commission was likely to take longer. North America accounts for about 75 per cent of the high- intensity sweetener market. Sucralose, which has been under development for more than a decade, is widely con- sidered to be a more versatile and stable product than aspar- tame, produced mainly by NutraSweet of the US. Sucralose has a longer life in soft drinks, and can be pas- teurised, baked and heated. Mr Eatherley declined to name any of Redpath's cus- tomers in Canada, but said they included some of the country's leading food and beverage makers. Sucralose is likely to appear in products on supermarket shelves within the next few months, once customers have completed test-marketing cam- paigns. Rich treats in the sugar bowl, Page 33",

Drexel, the once high-flying investment bank whose vir- tual demise has been linked to the Milken debicle, has filed a suit accusing Mr Milken of racketeering and breach of fiduciary duty when he was head of the company's junk bond department. It is seeking an unspecified amount of dam- ages. Mr Milken's brother, Lowell, who also worked in Drexel's junk bond department, is named in the suit. Drexel alleges the Milken brothers misappropriated its assets and business opportuni- ties for their personal benefit, and violated the company's policies by engaging in insider trading, frandulent and manipulative transactions, and securities law vio- lations. According to the filing, Mr Michael Milken received more than $Ibn (2595m) in direct compensation between 1985 and 1989. Mr Milken's lawyer, Mr Alan Dershowitz, described the lawsuit as absurd.",

   "text_content" : "By Frandi Ghils FIVE leading western export credit orgaisations, led by the US Embank, have offered to guarantee up to $1.88bn (C780m)-worth of credits to Sonatrach, Algeria's oil and gas monopoly. The funds, part of a 2.191mb package, are earmarked for revamping the company's three main Llaquefed Natural Gas (LNG) plants and the increase of their capacity, made necessary by the new foreign customers Sonatrach has signed up over the past two years. The revamping will be con- ducted by the three companies which initially built the plants, Bechtel and M.W. Keil- ogg of the US, and Soafega of France. The US Elabank will guar- antee loans worth $548m, which could rise to $1.05bn If ourcing from the US proves less costly than from other countries over the next three years. It will also, for the first time, inance part of the local costs. Japan's lxlabank will guarantee lods worth $440m, and Frances's Coface loans worth S2tem, with smaller amoqnts guaranteed by Can- ada's EDC and th UK's ECGD. Citicorp Group is leading syndication of the US Exim- bank guaranteed tranche, along with that of a $83m com- mercil bank loan. The loan has a maturity of seven years and carries a spread over Libor of % per cent. The grace period is the construction period, three years, plus six months. In further developments aimed at raising Algerian oil- field output, which at present averages only 25 per cent of recoverable reserves, Sons.a trach will invite foreign oil companies to bid for recovery improvement projects, allow- ing them to buy into existing output. The National Assembly has approved an amendment to the 1986 hydrocarbons law specifl- cally designed to avoid the double taxation of US and Jap- anese companies operating under sharing deals. Algerian offcals hope this more liberal law, will attract foreign investment and know-how, providing momentum for a new oil policy enhancing Algeria's foreign income and providing a sound basis for other Joint ventures tied to the oil and gas industry. International bankers involved in efforts to refinance Algeria's foreign debt have been encouraged by the sup- port for Algeria's economic reforms voiced by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF director-gen- eral, and by the Ecu400m (Â£279.2m) EC loan agreed in Brussels earlier this week.",

   "text_content" : "By David Housego in New Delhi and Paul Betts in London ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aircraft engine group, yester- day seemed to have lost a $150m (Â£88.7m) order from Air India for 20 engines to power four Boeing 747-400s ordered by the Indian national carrier. The loss of the Air India order would be a blow for the UK company, expected to announce today sharply lower first-half earnings. It comes after the loss to General Elec- tric (GE) of the US of a large order from British Airways for engines to power BA's new Boeing 777 aircraft, although Rolls-Royce was later chosen by Thai International Airways to power its new Boeing 777s. Air India said over a year ago it had selected Rolls-Royce to provide the engines for the Boeing 747s. The Indian carrier confirmed the Boeing 747 order last month. But an Air India spokesman said yesterday that GE and Pratt & Whitney had been asked to submit new bids. Observers see little chance of the UK group now being awarded the contract. Apart from the four Boeing 747s to be delivered between August 1993 and June 1994, Air India has taken an option on five more. If confirmed, this could mean a requirement of 25 engines, including a spare for each aircraft. The request to the US makers for fresh bids came after a recommendation by a government-appointed committee, under Dr V.S. Arunachalam, scientific adviser to the defence minister, set up in July to review the selection of the engine for the four Boeing 747s. In London last night, Rolls-Royce said it was sur- prised by the Indian reports; it had not heard from Air India and so was unable to comment any further. The development comes at a time of fierce com- petition in the commercial aero-engine market between GE, Pratt and Rolls-Royce. The US makers have been lobbying intensively since the initial choice of Rolls-Royce, made while the government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh was in power. The review was initi- ated by the government of Mr Chandra Shekhar and extended by the new administration of Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. An earlier decision to reverse a purchase by Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, of Boeing 757s caused a contro- versy in India. Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the then premier, ordered the purchase shelved in favour of the Airbus A-320.",

He added that Chrysler hoped to have at least a 20 per cent share of this market. Chrysler executives at the Frankfurt motor show also dis- closed that talks were under way with unnamed potential partners to set up a sales net- work in Russia, to complement similar networks which, they said, were already being put in place in most other east Euro- pean countries. Chrysler vehicles are already on sale in Yugoslavia, while sales agree- ments are in place or being negotiated in Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany. It was envisaged Chrysler would be able to play a role in providing expertise for devel- opment of vehicle markets in these countries, although it is ruling out any early prospect of manufacturing or assembly plants. Eurostar, Chrysler's first European manufacturing ven- ture, with Steyr-Daimler-Puch at Graz, Austria, goes on stream producing Voyager MPVs at the end of October. Eventual capacity is planned at 100,000, although first-year output is not expected to be much above 25,000. Executives said the venture would play a big role in boosting Chrysler's total overseas sales to about $2bn (Â£1.2bn) next year, against an expected $1.4bn this year.

If any trade legislation is ultimately to be passed by Con- gress, on the way it has to cross his desk and win his approval first. It gives him an important role in US legisla- tion affecting every aspect of US policy from Gatt's Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, to dealings with Japan and the republics of the former Soviet Union, which he has just visited, and developing regional economic zones in the Americas. Of Southern patrician mien and tone, his memory stretches back to the International Trade, Organisation, which was pro- posed to be part of the UN and to stand alongside the IMF and the World Bank. He regrets now that, because of US oppo- sition, it never got started. (1 was just finishing my college career at that time and had no ability to influence that decd sion.\") Gatt emerged instead. He draws his trading philos- ophy from Mr Cordell Hall, Roosevelt's secretary of state between 1933 and 1944, who single-mindedly championed the cause of free trade.

That's the key... to getting concessions from agricultural nations on services, intellectual property, on the new areas (in Gatt).\" The barrier to this was the EC's inability to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). He follows a familiar line in maintaining that without prog- ress on this front, there would be no success in other key areas such as intellectual prop- erty rights and services. Linked with that is the con- cern that in such a situation, developing countries would find themselves unable to con- tribute to a successful out- come. Mr Gibbons is by nature an optimist and he broadly agrees with the Republican adminis- tration's trade policies. But, a Europe has the \"fascinations\" of the single market by the end of 1992 and developments in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, it is distracted from Ioncentr-atig on CAP refonm. But above aD, \"It's the political will that's missing\", and as a result his current mood is that the Uruguay Round will at conme to a msuccesll conclu- sion.

It would take four months to wrap up the talks, once the EC had reached basic agreement on its farm policy. An EC farm ministers' meet- ing on September 21 would be the first opportunity for this. \"Add four months, and we will at least need January to wrap it up.\" would be the expiry of the fast- track authority in July 1993. Under this, Congress agrees to refrain from amending any trade agreement reached by the administration. It is com- mitted simply to voting the whole package in or out on the basis of a single vote.

   "article_dc_title" : "Poland Sets out to Lose Its Roubles",
   "text_content" : "By Christopher Boblnski in Warsaw FORMER Comecon members are seeking ways of spending the rouble surplus accounts bequeathed them after last January, when the entire region switched to hard-cur- rency payments in the wake of dissolution of the Soviet-led economic bloc. The quest is leading to inge- nious deals involving western countries. In one such, 25,000 tonnes of petrol were recently delivered by sea from Rotter- dam, to Szczecin and Gdansk, Poland, being paid for not in dollars, but transferable rou- bles earned in previous trade with Bulgaria. The importer is Acumen, a private company based in Kielce, southern Poland. The exporter is Fred Sparky, a Bul- garian company based in Sofia. The shipments take place within the framework of a Pol- ish-Bulgarian government accord stipulating that until end-November, 300,000 tonnes of petrol can be imported from Bulgaria by Poland at 180 transferable roubles a tonne. But what remains unclear is how Fred Sparky, a trading and production company, which has received the pay- ment in transferable roubles, will find the hard currency to pay the exporter in Rotterdam. Not that that worried the Pol- ish government. It is getting rid of some of its roubles. Acumen is pleased with the deal. It is paying ZllObn (Â£5.75m) for the oil shipments which would have cost ZI67bn had they had to pay directly in Rotterdam. Because of the rouble pay- ment, the customs duties and domestic taxes on the ship- ments, amounting to 105 per cent of the price, will be lower. The value at the retail outlets in Poland of 25,000 tonnes amounts to Z1122bn. The difference between the retail price and the rouble cost of the shipment will be met by a Polish government Export Development Fund tax, a cost Acumen must pick up. But it still shows a nice profit.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomsuon in Tokyo JAPAN'S trade surplus in August rose 68.4 per cent from the same month last year to $5.76bn (Â£3.4bn), and included an increase in the bilateral sur- plus with the US for the first time in five months, as exports rose with signs of a recovery in the US economy. The ministry of finance fig- ures heightened Japanese con- cerns about political problems arising from the fast-accumu- lating surplus this year, though fluctuations in cur- rency values and oil prices have exaggerated the increase. Customs-cleared exports for the month rose 10.4 per cent to $24.76bn, while exports were the same as last August at S19bn. Seasonally-adjusted, exports rose 2.3 per cent to $26.45bn, while imports fell 3.7 per cent to $19.21bn, and the surplus rose from July's $5.92bn to $7.24bn. Exports to the US rose 5.5 per cent from a year earlier to $7.5bn, while imports from the US rose 5.3 per cent to $4.5bn. Japan's exports to the Euro- pean Community rose 3 per cent to $4.3bn, while imports fell 18.1 per cent to $2.51bn, reflecting a slowdown in sales of imported cars and art works. Finance ministry officials were concerned that the sur- plus with the US increased just as a US senator suggested that new Super 301 trade action be launched against Japan. They said that luxury cars and office equipment were prominent among the exports to the US, and that they would watch the bilateral figures closely in coming months, indicating to Japanese compa- nies that they should exercise some restraint. Japan's car imports by value were 24.2 per cent lower than the same month last year, con- tinuing a fall that Japanese trade negotiators put down to the collapse of the financial \"bubble\" and to much slower sales of imported luxury vehicles. Imports of art works, a popu- lar bubble-related investment for the Japanese in recent years, fell 86.5 per cent from last August. The figures showed strong growth in exports of precision instruments (up 12.8 per cent) and ordinary machinery (up 11.7 per cent), with orders flow- ing from South-East Asian countries. Japan's surplus in trade with the rest of Asia showed a 52.1 per cent increase, and the sur- plus has been higher than the year earlier level for 18 consec- utive months.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington NOT so long ago the Pentagon would have winced at the pros- pect of losing the use of Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. Straddling the sea lanes from the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, the two bases were an integral part of US military strategy to contain Soviet power in East Asia. But when the Philippine Sen- ate cast a preliminary vote this week rejecting a new 10-year bases treaty with the US, Presi- dent George Bush's reaction was swift: \"We've made our best offer,\" he said. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, was equally blunt: \"We won't stay where we're not wanted, and if they want us out, we're gone.\" The shrinking Soviet threat is the principal reason why US planners appear relaxed at the possible end of a US military presence in the Philippines which goes back to the war against Spain in 1898. The collapse of communism has confirmed what many have long suspected: the Soviet Union's ability to \"project\" power has declined to the point where the US can rethink its entire national security strat- egy, specifically its reliance on far-flung bases. More immediately, the Pen- tagon has been laying contin- gency plans for withdrawal since 1988 when the first seri- ous Philippine opposition to a new bases treaty developed. The new treaty, which offers Manila $2.2bn (Â£1.3bn) over 10 years in exchange for contin- ued use of Subic, the largest US ship repair yard in Asia, was careful to hold out the prospect of eventual US with- drawal. Now, plans for a pull- out will simply be accelerated. Ship repair work could go to Japan. The US fleet could use US naval facilities in Singa- pore, Guam, or even Pearl Har- bour in Hawaii. (The decision to withdraw from Clark Air Base was taken last spring after it was buried in volcanic ash from Mount Pinatubo). Subic, with its skilled labour force and its strategic location, remains attractive. But not at any price. \"The reality,\" says one Asia-watcher in the admin- istration, \"is that there are no more rabbits in the hat.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Greg Hutchinson in Manila FOR Philippine senators who oppose the bases treaty, expul- sion of the US military pres- ence represents an historic assertion of sovereignty. The cost in terms of jobs, foregone compensation, access to for- eign loans and debt relief has taken second place in their minds. \"It is their shining moment in history,\" says Mr Alberto Romulo, a Philippine senator voting for the treaty. He says the temptation is strong to Join the anti-bases contingent. \"But I don't want to vote at the expense of many people who may lose their jobs.\" Opposition has been strengthened by the belated tactics of President Corazon Aquino to rally support for it \"The problem was that she took us for granted from the start,\" said Senator Rene Saguisag, a former spokesman of Mrs Aquino. After 15 months of arduous negotiations with Washington over the treaty's provisions, the president only seriously began courting the upper house on Tuesday by holding an 11th-hour rent-a-crowd rally and putting forward pro- posals for a referendum. Sach a tardy approach has only served to harden the senate's resolve in favour of ending the almost century-long US mill- tary presence. Many see the decision as a watershed that may allow the country to bring the left back into the fold of society. The National Democratic Front, the Philippines' communist umbrella group, has declared that it would effect a unilat- eral ceasefire against the gov- ernment should the treaty be rejected. The main left-wing trade union has said it would announce a moratorium on strikes. Washington has said it would start a pull-out soon if the treaty does not pass. The Senate must vote by Monday, when the lease expires. A two-thirds majority of the 234trong senate Is required to ratify the pact The government and some economists say the treaty's rejection would have an enor- mous impact on an already beattered economy. The official projected ecomnomic growth of 15 per cent this year would not be achievable, according to Mr Cayetano Paderanga, socodoomic planning secre- tary. In 132, growth would drop trom the target of 3. per cent to .4 per ent.",

   "text_content" : "By Julian Oanne in Nairobi MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said yester- day he had discussed the importance of free debate with the Kenyan president, Mr Dan- iel arap Moi, but brushed off opposition criticism of Kenya's human rights record. Mr Hurd, whose visit was preceded by an attack by unknown assailants on Mr Raila Odinga, a leading advo- cate of multi-party democracy, said: \"It would be bizarre to pick out Kenya as if she had some particularly bad record in respect of human rights.\" Leading dissidents accused Britain of failing to pressure Mr Moi to fall in line with a wave of democratic reform sweeping the African conti- nent. \"I would have liked him [Hurd] to say the same in Kenya that he said in Moscow, China, and South Africa,\" a leading government critic, Mr Gitobu Imanyara, told report- ers. The government's opponents are asking Britain to cut aid because of concerns about human rights abuses, corrup- tion and respect for the rule of law. Hours before his aircraft touched down in Nairobi, uni- dentified gunmen stoned and opened fire on the car of Mr Odinga, the son of a former vice-president and a man who has spent most of the past nine years behind bars, detained without charge for his political activity. Mr Odinga was recovering in hospital yesterday from neck and shoulder injuries. At a press conference, Mr Hurd avoided taking any detailed position on the contro- versial issues of clean govern- ment and respect for human rights, preferring instead to state Britain's general commit- ment to a soft but firm diplo- matic line aimed at gently encouraging the government to move towards change. He said Britain would con- tinue giving both public and private advice to Kenya as a \"friend\" but conceded that Britain would like to see multi-party democracy \"It is eventually desirable. I think it will come,\" Mr Hurd said. The attack on Mr Odinga will add to the growing politi- cal tension in Nairobi and fuel suspicions that some security elements, perhaps acting inde- pendently, are determined to use violence against opposition figureL Several government critics, including Mr Kenneth Matiba, who spearheaded the democ- racy campsn lt year, have been victims of attacs by un- identifed men.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0912_0006_006",
   "text_content" : "I By Hugh Cornmgy in Jerusalem ISRAEL yesterday set free 51 Lebanese prisoners and banded over the remains of nine Leb- anese guerrillas killed fighting Israeli forces in the first break- through in the Lebanese hos- tage issue since the release early last month of Mr John McCarthy of Britain and Mr Edward Tracy of the US. The Israeli Defence Ministry said it hoped the move would help Mr Javier Pdrez de Cud1- Jar, the UN secretary-general, achieve the release of what is believed to be 10 remaining western hostages, as well as resolving the fate of seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon. Last night Mr Hussein Mou- sawi, a member of the ruling council of Hizbollah, the Leb- anese Shia Moslem fundamen- talist group, said he expected \"some\" of the hostages to be released as a result of the Israeli action. Elements within Hizbollah, a loosely-structured group backed by Iran, are believed to be holding the western hos- tages, who include five Americans, two Britons and two Germans. In London, the Foreign Office welcomed the Israeli action, saying it hoped it would assist Mr Pdrez de Cudl- lar. But officials refused to speculate whether the release of remaining hostages, who include the Britons Mr Terry Waite, held since early 1987, and Mr Jackie Mann, would happen soon. irt yesterday welcomed the freeing of prisoners by Israel Sthe repatriation of the bodies of Hlbollah guerrillas as the first sign In a month that progress continues on hostage aslations, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut. h release last night of a statement that Mr Jackie Mann was in good health will also encourage Lebanese offlcals who know that until all remaining western hostages are free, the US will continue its boycott of Middle last Airlines, the ebanese flag carrie, and British Airways will not resume -ilghts to Beirut airport. Nor will western reconstruction aid be forthcoming until th issue is resolved. Until last night's development, Hlzbollah leaders had repeatedly said hostage negotiations were blocked following the failure of the Israelis to make a \"reciprocal gesture\" after the liberation of British hostage Mr John McCarthy. This was reiterated by Mr Mohammed Kazem Khonsari, the director of the Middle East desk at the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Mr Khonsari has been meeting Lebanese officials in Beirut this week. The return of the bodies of their guerrillas has never been a public demand of the Hlzbollah. However, one key demand of the hostage-takers - the free- dom of Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid - is likely to remain unsatistled until the conclusion of Mr Javier P6rez de Cuel- lar's hostage mission. The Israeli move was trig- gered by the receipt of informa- tion from Hizbollah about two of seven missing Israelis - the absence of which had previ- ously held up progress. Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's chief hostage negotiator, said it was the result of the efforts of Mr Pdrez de Cudllar, who was in Tehran yesterday for talks with Iranian leaders on the hostages. \"We all hope that this is the beginning of a process which solves the tragic problem of our prisoners and of the miss- ing western hostages once and for all,\" Mr Lubrani said. Mr Mousawi said: \"I expect Islamic groups holding the hos- tages to free some of them in return for the release of some of the strugglers and the hand- over of the bodies.\" When questioned over the timing he said: \"I think soon, but I don't know when. It could be next week, next month or more... I really don't know.\" Israel is willing to exchange the 300 Arab prisoners held by its surrogate Lebanese militia for a hostage deal. But it had rejected calls for a unilateral gesture until it had incontrovertible evidence about its own men from those holding them, whether dead or alive. The Israeli Defence Ministry said yesterday it now knew that Pte Rachamim al-Sheikh, 26, was dead. It also had some information about British-born Pte Yossi Fink, also 26, although it was not certain whether he was dead or alive. They were captured together in 1986. It then went ahead with the release of 51 prisoners from the al-Khiam jail in the south Leb- anon \"security zone\" occupied by Israel and the handover of the bodies of nine Hizbollah guerrillas dug up from a ceme- tery in northern Israel where dozens of Lebanese and Pales- tinian guerrillas are buried. Further releases will depend on more information about the other Israelis. Israel believes at least one of seven - Capt Ron Arad, an air force navigator shot down over Sidon in 1986 - may be alive. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, has alleged he was handed over by Shia captors to Iran. Another serviceman, a Druze sergeant, was captured by a Palestinian group in Sidon which later said he had been killed in an Israeli air raid. Three tank crew who went missing during a tank battle with Syrian forces in the Beka'a valley during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 are also unaccounted for.",

   "text_content" : "I By David Gardner in Strasbourg \"A VIOLENT storm\" is about to break across the Arab world unless western and Arab lead- ers act soon to promote democ- racy and development there, King Hussein of Jordan warned yesterday. He told the European Parlia- ment that \"the winds of change\" which had toppled autocracy across the world \"will sweep our world, where, I suggest, that in the absence of positive movement, no one should expect less. The Arab and Moslem peoples will not continue to remain comatose.\" King Hussein's often opaque and discursive speech wa piart appeal to other Arab leaders to democratise, part plea to the West to mend bridges with the Moslem world before the \"humiliation\" and \"despair\" felt by its peoples after the Gulf war crystallised into hatred. \"The war cost all Arabs great material losses leaving ever deepening wounds that will continue to bleed until the winds of change, if not heeded, will be turned by hatred, depri- vation and despair into a vio- lent storm of unpredictable change in the entire Arab and Moslem world,\" the King pre- dicted. In his speech, the Jordanian monarch was more upbeat about a Middle East peace set- tlement. He told journalists there was the \"chance of a pos- sible breakthrough for the first time in many years.\" The world \"is serious\" about peace in the region, he said. King Hussein used his visit to lobby support for Jordan's crumbling economy. He said that as a result of the war, 401 Jordanian ships had been \"intercepted, delayed, turned back or diverted\" from the port of Aqaba. \"No other state neighbouring Iraq has been similarly treated,\" he complained. The cutting off of Arab aid which followed Jordan's equiv- ocal stance towards Iraq means the Kingdom's airline will probably lose its modem Air- bus fleet through defaulting on its loans, he said. This, he said, was at a time when Jordan was coping alone with an estimated 300,000 Pal- estinians ejected from Kuwait and the Gulf, adding 13 per cent more students to Jordan's crowded schools, and raising unemployment to 32 per cent. aThe Jordanian foreign minis- ter, Mr Abdullah al-Nsour, said after meeting Egyptian Presi- dent Hosni Mubarak yesterday that the two countries would put behind them recent sharp exchanges and work to repair their strained relations, Reuter reports hom Cairo.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney THE Australian government began revising its gloomy fore- casts for unemployment yester- day after a batch of statistics indicated that the economy was beginning to recover from recession. Unemployment reached 9.8 per cent in July, and figures for August to be published today are expected to show a further inrease. However, Mr John Dawkins, the employment minister, said he was more confident about the outlook than during the preparation of the federa gov- ernment budget early last month, which forecast that unempioyment would peak at 10.75 cent later this yiar. Mr Dawkin released for the first time a leading index of employment indicators pre- pared by his department which shows that the rate of contrac- tion in employment fell from a peak of 1.S per cent in March to 1.15 per cent in July. Mr Dawkins said the leading index had indicated a return to growth around six months ahead of the real economy in previous cycles, although the time lags varied widely. The indicators \"seem to sug- gest that if we have not yet arrived at the turning point we are not far away from it,\" he said. Mr Dawkins' optimism was supported by figures showing that the value of retail trade rose by 2.2 per cent in July after stagnating in June. The value of retail trade grew by 1.2 per cent in the three months to July. The number of housing starts also increased by 2.4 per cent in the three months to June after a sharp fall of 3.7 per cent in the previ- ous quarter. In addition, the Westpac-Mel- bourne Institute Leading Index, which has previously proved a good guide to broad movements in the economy, rose by 2.9 per cent in July, confirming an upward trend. Economists said the various figures were consistent with an economy which has entered a recovery phase following nega- tive growth of 2.4 per cent in the year to the end of June. However, most warned that the recovery was likely to gather pace slowly.",

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday denied that he had offered a specific promise to Israel to provide $10bn in loan guarantees to help settle Soviet Jewish emigrds. Mr Bush said the US was committed to helping Israel absorb Jewish immigration as a matter of principle, but he cautioned: \"I am not commit- ted to any numbers and never have been.\" His remarks risked escalat- ing tensions with Mr Yitzhak Shamir's government in Jeru- salem, and could increase the prospect of a showdown with the US Congress where pro-Is- raeli sentiment remains strong. Mr Bush has turned the loan guarantee issue into a test of strength ever since he announced last Friday that he wanted Congress to wait for 120 days before approving the guarantees. Paradoxically, his request is also turning into a test of strength of the Israeli lobby in the US. Mr Bush sent a letter to US Senators promis- ing action at the end of 120 days, but repeating earlier warnings that approval of the aid could jeopardise his efforts to convene a Middle East peace conference. The White House has sent signals that it would like to avoid a head-on collision with Mr Yitzhak Shamir's govern- ment in Israel. But the outburst by Mr Bush yesterday was further evi- dence of the mistrust which has developed between the US and Israel, long-time allies. Mr Bush appeared irritated by official Israeli claims that the US had given a specific promise to honour the $lObn in loan guarantees, and that Israel would reject a compro- mise. Many observers believe Mr Bush is using the loan guarantees as leverage over the Israelis in the early stages of the peace talks. Two key Israeli supporters announced yesterday they intended to introduce legisla- tion as amendments to a pend- ing foreign aid appropriations bill in the Senate which would allow Israel to use the guaran- tees which allow access to lower interest rates on the commercial market. Iraq stalling over UN co-operation IRAQ has failed to co-operate fully in any key areas of a continuing UN effort to iden- tify and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, the head of the operation said yester- day, writes Michael Little- Johns, UN Correspondent, in New York. The official, Mr Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, briefed correspon- dents as Security Council members considered in private how to respond to Baghdad's rejection of a demand that the UN be allowed to fly its own helicopters for inspection and control.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent in Frankfurl AUTOMOTIVE manufacturing was going through a \"tremen- dous transition\" and western car makers had to change and change fast, Mr Robert Stem- pel, chairman of General Motors of the US, the world's biggest car maker, warned yes- terday. The American car industry had already been hit hard, and the recent agreement between the European Commission and CONFERENCE WORLD MOTOR INDUSTRY Japan over trade in cars in the single European market had only bought a \"brief period\" to prepare for the real competi- tive contest that would be com- ing to Europe, he told the Financial Times World Motor Industry Conference. \"We can all learn from the North American experience and we don't have to make the same mistakes in the EC or middle Europe.\" So-called \"lean\" production methods had to be adopted by the world motor industry. This could mean using about half the traditional factory space, and about one-tenth of the inventories. Lean organisa- tions achieved dramatically higher quality and productiv- ity and more efficient and fas- ter product development. Despite all the \"daring talk\" of the last decade there was still no \"world car\", he said. Car makers faced a \"global/lo- cal paradox\". They had to be global in out- look, utilising ideas, material and designs from all over the world to meet customers' desires, and had to source com- ponents globally. At the same time, they had to measure local tastes and conditions which still differed too widely I for a single car to satisfy all. Mr Paolo Cantarella, presi- dent and chief executive officer of Fiat Auto, said that there had been a slump in local pro- duction in countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary since the opening up of these markets. For the same price custom- ers in eastern Europe preferred to buy a second-hand western car rather than a new locally built product. But the price of a new west- ern car was out of the reach of most eastern consumers, and the countries' economic systems could not sustain a large-scale outlay of currency such a vital sector. Mr Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler, warned that Ameri- can public opinion would not tolerate for ever the \"crushing trade deficits\" the US had experienced for most of the past decade. The automotive sector now accounted for 69 per cent of America's total trade deficit with the world. Chrysler had dramatically improved the development time taken for new products, he said. Mr Chung Se Yung, chair- man of Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, called for technological co-operation to be emphasised more than any other field. \"I would believe that making technology available to developing coun- tries is the responsibility of developed countries but at the same time it could be to their advantage in the end.\" Mr Noel Goutard, chairman of Valeo, the French automo- tive components maker, said the European industry still had to take full advantage of the competitive edge generated by a close and supportive relation- ship with suppliers in a spirit of mutual reliance. But time was running short. He asked whether the compo- nents supply sector had to pro- vide some kind of banking ser- vice to the vehicle assemblers as it was made to finance inventory, development, heavy research and development resources and tooling.",

   "text_content" : "Bankers' huddle: Clark CllUord, left, and Robert Altman, ngEn, uai ro lawyers Deiore yesieraay's conmmuw ermasu AT 8.49am yes- terday Mr Clark Clifford, | the 85-year-old * | Democratic icon, stood before the cameramen inside the hearing room of the House Banking Committee, his fedora in hand. At his side was Mr Robert Altman, his proteg6, and Mr Altman's glamorous wife - Ms Lynda Carter, the actress who played Wonder Woman on US television. More than an hour later Mr Clifford began to speak: \"I want to tell you the story ...So now I will begin to tell it. I will tell it in narrative form because I believe that it will be be more interesting to you and more easy for you to assimilate.\" With a condescending smile on his craggy face, Mr Clifford thus began his string of denials of charges that he knew of the secret control by Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional of First American Bank- shares, the Washington bank he chaired until he resigned last month. Mr Altman, former First American president, also denied any knowledge of links. Their task was complicated by the release of a damning 63-page report by Republican members of the committee which challenged their denials. Undaunted, Mr Clifford brushed aside his role over the past decade as lawyer to BCCI and to Credit and Commerce Holdings (CCAH), the BCCI vehicle that maintained secret control of First American. He also denied any impropriety in the millions of dollars profit he made on CCAH shares he bought with loans from BCCL While treating the commit- tee members rather like school- children, Mr Clifford also made a determined effort to show the respect once accorded by US banks and the Bank of England to Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, the BCCI founder who became his friend and the \"communications link\" between First American and the BCCI front men who were First American shareholders. He also spoke glowingly of Sheik Kamal Adham, the Saudi busi- nessman who the Federal Reserve has alleged was one of the key front men for BCCI. Sheik Adham, like Mr Clifford, is currently a target of BCCI investigators in the US. Mr Clifford did this by releasing copies of letters of reference and by quoting a 1977 article in The Economist stating that the Bank of England had been pre- pared to vouch for Mr Abedi. Most of all, Mr Clifford com- plained about the damage done to his reputation by the BCCI affair. But the report released by Republican members of the committee cites documents obtained by subpoena from First American, BCCI, the Fed- eral Reserve and Abu Dhabi - all of which strongly suggest that Mr Clifford should have known about BCCI's involve- ment in First American. Mr Clifford promised US bank regulators a decade ago that there would be no links between BCCI and First Ameri- can. Among the alleged links cited in yesterday's report are: * A total of 47 BCCI branches, subsidiaries and affiliates held accounts at First American Bank in New York. * A 1986 memo to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, president of BCCI, from Mr Clifford and Mr Altman concerning difficulties in what has been shown to be BCCI's indirect purchase of the National Bank of Georgia. * Mr Clifford and Mr Altman managed a $30m defence fund for BCCI. Cheques went through First American and BCCI board minutes show that Mr Altman was involved in BCCI's legal strategy. * BCCI, with Mr Altman's knowledge, participated in the selection of officers for First American Bank of New York (Fabny), including Mr K.K. Elley, an executive hired at the suggestion of Mr Naqvi. * A 1983 telex found in BCCI's Abu Dhabi files from Mr Imran Iman of BCCI to Mr Elley at Fabny seems to indicate that BCCI was directly supplying $75m in capital to CCAH. * Contrary to assertions from Mr Altman and Mr Clifford that BCCI did not direct board members of CCAH, committee staff found documents showing that BCCI officials were involved with the affairs of CCAH to the extent that it would draft letters from CCAH to independent auditors. * A 1987 memo from Mr Iman to a law partner of Mr Clif- ford's in Washington for- warded a draft reply from the Abu Dhabi Investment Author- ity (ADIA) to auditors and the following request: \"I shall appreciate if you would have the draft typed on CCAH letter- head after consulting Mr Alt- man, and courier the letter to me to be sent by hand to ADIA.\" These are only a few of the numerous items found by the congressional investigators. Several congressmen stressed that neither Mr Clif- ford nor Mr Altman has been charged with any crimes and that yesterday's hearing was not intended as a trial. For Mr Clifford, however, it was an undeniably humbling experi- ence for a once grand old man.",

Mr Naqvi, indicted in the US on fraud charges, was among about 36 senior BCCI officers detained by police in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The approach was said by an official close to the investiga- tion to have been made through diplomatic channels on Tuesday by the Justice Department in conjunction with the office of Mr Robert Morganthau, Manhattan dis- trict attorney. The US embassy in Abu Dhabi would not com- ment yesterday. A US official said unofficial soundings had indicated that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, was becoming increas- ingly receptive to the sugges- tion of handing over Mr Naqvi. But sources close to the Abu Dhabi government said they would be surprised if the shelkh agreed to the request. No extradition treaty exists between the two countries. An Abu Dhabi official stressed yesterday that the weekend arrests were con- ceived entirely in Abu Dhabi. About 22 people were still being held yesterday. A com- plete list of those in detention has not yet been released but the most reliable list available, confirmed by an Abu Dhabi official, includes: Mr Naqvi, Mr Zafar Iqbal, chief executive officer, Mr Bashir Tahir, man- aging director of BCC Emir- ates, Mr Iqbal Rizvi, Mr Imntiaz Ahmed, Mr Fakhar Hussein, Mr Amir Siddiqui, Mr Selem Siddiqui, Mr Shahed Siddiqui, Mr Amir Siddiki, Mr Mohammed Azmatullah, Mr Nadim Habibullah, Mr Arjoman Naqvi, Mr Abdul Haseez, Mr Aftab Shaikh, and Mr Askari Hasan Khan.

The Dodds Arms public house in the Elswick area of the city was gutted after nine firemen in two engines trying to put out the blaze were forced to Withdraw by volleys of bricks and stones. Mr Bill Dunlop, the deputy chief officer of Tyne and Wear fire brigade, said he suspected the fire had been started by petrol bombs. One firefighter was slightly injured. The fire engines had windscreens and lights smashed. The mob dispersed after members of Northumbria police Special Patrol Group arrived. Later inithe evening the mob moved to the Benwell shopping centre where shops were bro- ken into and looted and to the Cruddas Park area. Early this morning the Cruddas Park library was reported as among the buildings which had been set on fire. Police s id that the sporadic outbreaks of unrest led to five arrests. The trouble was thought to be opportunistic action trig- gered by the knowledge that police resources are heavily committed to the Meadow Well estate in North Shields, after Monday night's riots. For two years Cruddas Park has been the subject of an ini- tiative by government and pri- vate sector bodies aimed at tackling high unemployment and social malaise.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent THE French have come up with a neat solution for Britons who want to see more money invested in their cash-starved railways. If the UK government will not let British Rail have any more money, they say, then let the French rail- ways have it instead. In a move rich with irony, a delegation from SNCF, the French national railway organi- sation, has spent three days in Lon- don and Edinbutgh this week invit- ing British institutional fund manag- ers to invest in the expansion of the French network. In Britain, government rules pre- vent state-owned BR from financing its investment programme from any- thing but its own internally gener- ated revenues and government debt. With government loans strictly rationed and internally generated revenues badly hit by recession, BR is experiencing a cash crisis, causing several important investment pro- jects to be shelved. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and the Labour party have argued that BR should be freed from government constraints and left to flance its investment programme from money raised on the commercial markets. That is what happens in France, where the state-owned railway finances most of its borrowings on the international and domestic bond markets. The result has been Europe's biggest railway expansion programme, characterised by the trin grande vitesse (TGV). The SNCF team visiting Britain was selling the attractions of a new SNCF 12-year bond being traded on the French domestic market, sales of which are expected to raise FFrl2bn (Â£1.2bn) to FFrl3bn by the end of the year. This and other bond issues are helping to finance a railway invest. ment programme roughly twice as big as Britain's. The Treasury will not change the rules because it says borrowing by a state-owned corporation is the same as any other public-sector borrowing and must be done under the aegis of the Exchequer. The Department of Transport says that the French and British levels of railway investment are consistent because the French network is twice as big as Britain's in route mileage. Meanwhile, UK finance is already helping SNCF build three new TGV lines to add to its already extensive network. The last main line built in Britain opened in April 1906.",

As part of the organisation's action to highlight industrial discharges into river and coastal waters, Greenpeace activists yesterday tried to block a Marchon plant dis- charge pipe which, they claimed, was illegally pouring pollutants into the sea. Twenty-three protesters, including Mr Tim Birch, Greenpeace toxics campaigner, were arrested. Last night 22 people were charged with crim- inal damage. The attempt to block the pipe, which emits millions of gallons of water each day, was condemned by Albright as \"an act of utmost lunacy\" that dis- regarded the safety of the sac- tory's 1,500 employees. The protesters' partial block- ing of the main effluent pipe and complete blocking of the emergency outfall meant sev- eral plants on the site had to be temporarily shut down for safety reasons. The cost of repairs and lost output of phos- phate products will reach at least six figures, said the com- pany, which has denied breach- ing permitted discharge levels. Greenpeace alleges the NRA's licence system allows companies to pollute the envi- ronment. The pressure group also alleges that the NRA fails to prosecute when companies exceed their licence limits. Greenpeace hopes the court will declare that the NRA failed to monitor Albright's discharges last November, and oblige it to amend the licence which allows Marchon to dis- charge a total of more than 500 tonnes of chromium, copper, zinc, lead, mercury, nickel and cadmium each year. Last week the NRA announced it was bringing a prosecution against the com- pany over an alleged breach of discharge limits. But Green- peace has since initiated another prosecution alleging five separate offences. The NRA replied that it did not hesitate to take a tough line with polluters.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans CLAIMS BY some civil engipeering companies that the water industry has been failing to keep up with its big capital spending programme were in effect rebuffed yester- day in a progress report by the National Economic Develop- ment Office (Nedo). Capital expenditure by all 10 water companies privatised two years ago came to Â£2.3bn in the year to the end of March - an increase of 40 per cent on the previous year. In addition, a further Â£490m was spent in Scotland and Northern Ireland by the National Rivers Authority, the environment watchdog, and the other water supply compa- nies. The Nedo report says: \"Capi- tal expenditure was close to CUSTOMERS of South West Water could face much higher bills next year to pay for additional clean-up pro- grammes. Mr Keith Court, chairman, yesterday told the annual meeting that the company planned to spend an extra Â£300m, largely on Improve- ments to its sea waste out- plan and the water pics have successfully achieved a major increase in investment, the highest in real terms for at least 15 years, with few diffi- culties and without creating significant supply-side bottle- necks.\" The report was drafted by Mr David Cawthra, chief execu- tive of Balfour Beatty, a civil fails, to bring all beadhes In the area up to EC standards. The company can already Increase charges by 6.5 per cent above inflation each year until 1995 and then by 5 per cent above Inflation for the next five years. This Is one of the highest allowed annual increases among the 10 water and sewage compa- engineering subsidiary of BICC, for Neddy's construction industry sector group. It fol- lows months of bickering between water companies and some suppliers over whether big orders to implement the Â£28bn spending programme over the next decade were com- ing through on schedule. Nedo thinks the perceived nies privatised two years ago. SWW will shortly ask Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of ofwat, the industry's eco- nomic regulator, for permsl- sion to increase charges even further from next ApriL An answer is expected from Ofwat by the end of the year. shortfall in spending was prob- ably caused by three factors: civil engineering now accounted for a declining pro- portion of water industry spending; much of the work was of modest value and went unreported; and more work was done by the engineering arms of the big contractors. Nedo found that the reces- sion had led to tfalling tender prices, particularly during the latter part of this year. Those would probably have little impact on capital spending in 1990-91, but would have a greater impact in 1991-92. The report says: \"Whether this will result in a reduction in capital expenditure or encourage the water compa- nies to take advantage of of the competitive state of the supply market and bring forward addi tional projects remains to be seen.\" Adherence to the planned programme was achieved in many cases by bringing for- ward projects to replace those subject to delay. The report says: \"The flexibility shown by the water plcs is encouraging for the supply side.\"",

   "text_content" : "I By Michael Smih, Labour Correspondent SOUTH WEST WATER is being threatened with a strike ballot after implementing a new salary structure for white-collar staff which Nalgo, the public service union, says will lead to many members being regraded on to lower pay scales. The company has said the earnings of existing staff will be maintained, but the union is oncerned that the restructur- ing will lead to lower pay ries and to new staff being employed on inferior terms. Nalgo said the imposition of the structure without ree ment is a threat to its right to negotiate pay directly with the cOmpany. Mr Alan Jinknson, general secretary, said the company would face a fight if t failed to open negotiations. A strike ballot among the union's i00 .mibes at South West Water would be triggered tomorrow if the company failed to open talks with the union. South West Water is one of many employers which are changing pay structures. Employers' aims usually include simplifying earnings scales, agig ainst claim EMPLOYMENT for equal pay for work of equal value, and relating earnings more closely to rforance. Bit, one of the two unions with members at Lloyds Bank, is organising a strike ballot ovw the bank's proposals. The South West Water restructuring will result in higher pay scales for those in senior white-collar Jobs, but lower scales for some of their colleages at the bottom of the salary scale. The maxiamum will rise from Â£25,917 to Â£27,961, whereas the minimum will fall from Â£6,820 to Â£6,129. Mr Bryn Evans, Nalgo dis- trict officer, said the company had indicated that, although earnings of existing employees would be protected, future rises would be based on the new scales rather than the old. The company had offered talks on the appeals rocedure for people who objected to their grading, but not been prepared to talk about the new pay structure. South West Water would not comment in detail on the pro- posals but said it was in talks with staff and represntatives to resolve Individual concerns. * Cooperative Bank has told union leaders it is prepared to end a pay MeaPie that has been in force since April. It has asked them for talks next month at which it will make an offer. Bifu, the financial services union, will press for the offer to be backdated to April, although it is likely the bank will want any deal to take effect from October. The bank has said previously it would consider making an offer from October in the light of half- year results, due tomorrow. * Nearly 20 per cent of compa- nies plan increased use of staff relocation in order to reduce labour costs and overheads, according to a survey of 3,000 oranisatios Or 90 per cent of compa- nies offer some kind of assis- tance to relocated staff, includ- ing bridging loans (offered by 10 per cent) and temporary accommodaton (s per cent) found the survey conducted by the relocation arm of Nation- wide Angla Buildng Society.

   "text_content" : "By David Churchill, Leisure Industries Correspondent THE pressure on receivers Grant Thornton to achieve an early sale of Keith Prowse, the theatre tickets and corporate hospitality group, mounted yesterday. London theatre managers warned they were unlikely to continue to accept Keith Prowse tickets after the weekend. The Society of West End Theatres will meet today to discuss the collapse of the Keith Prowse group, which went into receivership last Monday. But a spokesman for the society said last night it was \"highly unlikely\" that Keith Prowse ticket holders would be allowed into perfor- mances after the weekend. Most London theatres have agreed to honour Keith Prowse tickets bought by the public until Saturday night. However, they want some indication from the receivers that the ticket agency business will be sold as a going concern, and that tickets already sold but not paid for will be honoured. The receivers said last night that talks were still continuing with a number of interested buyers for both the ticketing business and the corporate- hospitality operation. The position of companies that bought corporate-hospital- ity packages from Keith Prowse improved yesterday. The Rugby World Cup organis- ers said that all corporate- hospitality packages would be honoured, although it remained unclear whether the organisers had actually received payment from Keith Prowse before the collapse. Golfing enthusiasts planning to fly out on Concorde to the US to see the Ryder Cup tour- nament later this month are also hopeful that the flight will go ahead as planned. The Pro- sessional Golfers' Association has been talking with the receivers for the past two days. British Airways said that a meeting between all the parties was likely to be held tomorrow and might enable the Concorde flight to go ahead. The 35-strong Hilton hotel chain in the UK, part of the Ladbroke Group, has also agreed to honour all Keith Prowse bookings.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters S.G. WARBURG, the City's leading integrated merchant bank, said yesterday that it was dividing the roles of chair- man and chief executive for the first time, prompting renewed speculation that Sir David Scholey, previously holder of both jobs, is prepar- ing to leave the firm. Sir David, 56, who will give up the chief executive title on October 1, has frequently been talked of as the next governor of the Bank of England. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton has indicated he does not intend to stay after his second five-year term as governor expires in June 1993. Sir David is to remain chair- man of Warburg and a full-time executive, while the chief executive's chair goes to Lord Cairns, a corporate sinan- cier who has been with the group for 12 years. Lord Cairns will also become deputy chair- man of the merchant banking group, widely seen as the most successful of the integrated investment banks created at the time of the City's Big Bang. His appointment will resolve a growing question within Warburg about the succession to Sir David, a strong leader who has run the group for the past decade. Several top man- agers were said to be in the running. Sir David said that the deci- sion to appoint a separate chief executive was prompted by the growth of the group since its formation five years ago. As chairman, Sir David will remain responsible for the affairs of the board, relations with shareholders, the appoint- ment of senior staff and the group's strategy. His executive status did not mean that the group would be left with two chief executives, he added. Warburg denied that its shareholders had encouraged it to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, though it said that the move in part reflected the trend towards such a division. Sir David emphasised that the decision owed nothing to fashion. Observer, Page 20 Breach denial, Page 32",

   "text_content" : "By Juliet Sycuhrva BRITAIN will have at least five new wind farms a year from 1992, if ambi- tious plans by National Wind Power, a company launched yesterday by National Power, British Aerospace and Taylor Woodrow, are fulfilled. \"The prospects for wind generation never looked better,\" said Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, at the com- pany's launch yesterday in London, which he described as an important milestone in the history of wind power. The company, which inherits 21 wind power projects from its parent compa- nies, expects to build five wind farms every year until 2000. This would give it a total of at least 250MW of wind power - enough to supply nearly 200,000 people. The farms should generate electricity at about 4p per unit if their capital costs of about Â£1,000 per kw are allo- cated over a 20-25 year period, said Dr Peter Chester, National Power's execu- tive director of technology and environ- ment. He will be the new company's chairman. This compares with a price in the electricity spot market, or pool, of about 2p per unit. National Wind Power acknowledged that the present econom- ics of wind power meant it would depend heavily on the government sub- sidy scheme for renewable energy, the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation(NFFO), which is due to expire in 1996. But Mr John Wakeham, who confirmed yester- day that the NFFO had been oversub- scribed, hinted that it might be granted the extension beyond 1998 that the renewable energy industry has keenly requested. Mr Colin Moynihan, the energy minister responsible for renew- ables, was looking at the duration of the NFFO, Mr Wakeham said. National Wind Power stressed the importance of government support for the future of wind energy. Although the UK had the best potential for wind power, especially in Scotland, of any European country, it was far behind in exploiting the resource. The company estimated that wind power could suply 10 per cent of UK energy consumption by the year 2025, a figure that would require 20,00025,000 turbines. Of the 21 wind projects which National Wind Power inherits from its parent companies, 18 proposals totalling 113MW have been submitted to this year's NFFO, which closed at the end of August, and three projects totalling 13MW won support under last year's scheme. The projects include a 4.5MW project on Kirkby Moor, Cumbria, a 7.2MW project in Cemmaes, mid Wales, a 1.2MW project in Camarthen Bay, and two projects totalling over 10MW in Conwl",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0912_0010_002",
   "text_content" : "By Peter Marsh, Economics Staff BRITAIN had a deficit on its earnings from interest, profits and dividends (IPD) of nearly Â£800m in the first six months of 1991. This was against a sur- plus of Â£4bn in the whole of last year, according to figures published yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. The swing into deficit in this part of the UK's balance of pay- ments offsets the encouraging performance in invisible trade generally - which includes IPD, services and government transfers. It also arises in spite of a steady improvement in the net overseas earnings of UK financial institutions such as banks and insurance compa- nies. This figure, which includes cash earned on sinan- cial services and some ele- ments of IPD, rose to Â£14.1bn in 1990, from Â£12.8bn in 1989. Net IPD comprises the sum of capital flowing in and out of Britain arising from payments related to shares and other financial instruments, the com- mercial performance of compa- nies and returns on physical assets such as buildings. Britain last had an annual IPD deficit in 1980. The big current-account deficits at the end of the 1980s - Â£20.4bn in 1989 and a revised Â£14.4bn last year - meant UK banks and other institutions had to borrow overseas to finance increased UK spending on imports. This has pushed up interest payments to non-UK lenders. Another factor reducing net IPD flows into Britain has been reduced spending on overseas acquisitions by UK businesses, together with a rise in inward investment by foreign compa- nies. Current trends indicate it is likely that reduced IPD income for the UK will continue for some time. Other highlights from the CSO's balance of payments data for 1990 and the first half of 1991 include: Net overseas receipts of financial Institutions : The UK's deficits on travel and civil aviation - part of trade in services which were hit by the Gulf war - stabi- lised in the second quarter of 1991. For travel the deficit was Â£820m, compared with Â£897m in the first quarter; in civil avi- ation the figures were Â£68m and Â£189m respectively. * Britain's net overseas assets fell to Â£29.6bn at the end of 1990, compared with Â£83.7bn the year before, largely because of currency and stock market movements and increased purchases by over- seas groups of UK securities. * The CSO has reduced its estimate of the balancing item for 1989 - the discrepancy between the deficit on that year's current account, and recorded capital flows into Britain - from nearly Â£15bn to Â£7.5bn. The Baltic Exchange, the London ship chartering and shipbroking market, yesterday reported a rise in its contribu- tion to invisible earnings from Â£427m to a record Â£664m in the latest financial year. Mr Peter Tudball, chairman, said the rise reflected increased activity in the sale and purchase of vessels and record levels of movement in dry bulk and oil cargoes.",

The speciality materials group announced that with both its UK plants continuing to operate well below capacity, it intends to close its factory at Barrow, Cumbria. The 375 redundancies will be a big blow to the local econ- omy, given the the large job losses announced in March by the VSEL submarine yard. Courtaulds said that produc- tion is to be concentrated at its other UK plant in Bridgwater, Somerset, where an additional 46 jobs will also be lost. In 1989, the company closed down its only other Cellophane plant in Canada. The closure is in response to a continuing decline in demand for cellulosic film in world markets, which are con- tracting at about 10 per cent a year. Products like Cellophane are being replaced by cheaper, alternative packaging materi- als and competition for the remaining customers is intense. A Courtaulds spokesman said that although the com- pany remained one of the larg- est world suppliers of cellulosic film, it could only continue to compete effectively by substan- tially reducing costs through a reduction in capacity. Consultations on the job losses have started and Court- aulds has pledged a pro- gramme of assistance to find new employment for those affected. The closure of Barrow coin- cided with the launch yester- day of Furness Enterprise, the agency established to encourage business expansion and investment in the area. Together with the Depart- ment of Trade and Industry. backed Cumbria Action Team, the agency will endeavour to ensure that the area derives maximum benefit from govern- ment-department spending pro- grammes.

Those chosen attend a resi- dential weekend, then meet one day a month for visits, debates and talks on subjects including local government, crime and education. Councils or business bodies in 13 more cities have already developed programmes, and organisations in 15 others have expressed interest.

   "text_content" : "A v By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff PRESSURE on the government to tackle growing unemploy- ment intensified yesterday. Campaigning groups, unions and academic economists launched plans for the jobless to focus attention on today's announcement of the unem- ployment figures for August. Those are expected to show a further rise of 60,000, taking the total beyond 2.4m. Monthly rises measured by a three-month average have slipped from about 94,000 in April to about 65,000 in July, but economists predict that unemployment will rise for most of next year towards 3m. Unemployment groups and academics are anxious to keep up the pressure by arguing that government claims that the recession has ended must be balanced against the rapid acceleration of job losses in 1991. The Trades Union Congress yesterday published an analy- sis of job losses in several sec- tors not covered in detail by today's official labour-market data. The TUC said that in the early part of this year thedis- tributive sector, \"on which the government has been pinning its hopes of recovery,\" suffered heavy job losses. In distribution, 109,000 jobs were lost in the first quarter of 1991 compared with 30,000 in the whole of 1990. Job losses in manufacturing continued to mount sharply, while the con- struction and finance sectors both lost as many jobs in the first three months of 1991 as in the whole of last year. Mr Norman Willis, TUC gen- eral secretary, said its analysis revealed serious weaknesses in some of the most important sectors. He called for \"urgent action\" rather than \"compla- cent words\". His plea was echoed by the Campaign for Work lobby- group on unemployment, which launched a campaign against the introduction of benefit-based work schemes to conceal \"the true figures of mass unemployment\". Mr Richard Layard and Mr John Philpott, researchers from the London School of Economics and the Employ- ment Institute respectively, also declared government schemes cheap and inade- quate. They published propos- als to eliminate long-term unemployment in five years. Stopping Unemployment. Employment Institute, South- bank House, Black Prince Road. London SE1 7SJ. Â£9.95.",

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins and Lisa Wood LABOUR yesterday accused ministers of economic manipu- lation, claiming a leaked mem- orandum showed that a tempo- rary programme for the unemployed was being timed to coincide with a possible gen- eral election campaign. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said Employment Action, which will provide work experience for the jobless, would start next month and build to full capacity in March 1992. But it would be wound down by March 1993. He said that only about 26,000 people would have places on the scheme at any time - less than half of one month's rise in unemployment. A Â£2.35m advertising campaign would be launched next month, possibly during the Tories' annual conference. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, continued party condemnation of government claims of an imminent eco- nomic recovery. The govern- ment would try to create the illusion of better times as the election approached, he said. But the recession was \"cer- tain\" to continue next year. He did not deny that interest rates and inflation would fall further, but said a genuine recovery could not be claimed if indicators such as unemploy- ment and mortgage reposses- sions were still risig. Labour party strategists are determined to attack Conserva- tive optimism over the econ- omy, even if, in terms of the strict technical definition, the recession ends. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, will next week set out Labour's own definition of what a recovery would mean. Mr Hattersley said that the Tories engineered a \"bogus boom\" before the 1987 election. Afterwards, \"the bill for their victory had to be paid by the people of this country\". Commenting on the leaked memorandum, the Employ- ment Department denied any link between electioneering and Employment Action. The advertising campaign would simply be a new version of existing commercials. The department said it was confident that by March next year Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) would be offer- ing about 30,000 people places on the scheme. Seventy-eight of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales have applied to take part in the scheme. The four non-partici- pating Tecs are North West London, North Derbyshire, Leeds and Sheffield.",

The arts are Britain's fourth- biggest source of invisible earnings after banking, travel and shipping, said Mr Mark Fisher, shadow minister for the arts and media.

Mr Kinnock said: \"The arts earn money for the country, pay large revenues and make a direct contribution to the qual- ity of industrial and commer- cial design and production.\" Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the party, said a Labour government would introduce a Freedom of Infor- mation Act in the \"early weeks\" of coming to power. Under the party's plans, local authorities would have a statutory responsibility to develop an arts and tnuseum service.

   "article_dc_title" : "Wilson Seeks to Destroy Image of 'Wasted Vote'",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stphens, Political Editor THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS signalled yesterday that they will put the claim that Mr Neil Kinnock can never defeat the Conservatives at the heart of their general election cam- paign. As Mr Paddy Ashdown put the final touches to the closing speech he will make at the con- ference this morning, Mr Des Wilson, the campaign director, set out a strategy aimed at con- vincing voters that supporting a third party no longer repre- sented a \"wasted vote\". Mr Ashdown, who has sur- vived a number of skirmishes this week with the media - and with Mr Wilson about pub- lic discussion of the stance the party would adopt in the event of a hung parliament - will seek to reinforce that message. He will tell the conference that the Liberal Democrats now have the policies, the party organisation and the political momentum to secure a breakthrough at the election. His speech will set out a per- sonal vision of the changes necessary if Britain is to become a successful, modern industrial nation, based on the slogan that \"there is nothing that Britain cannot do if it learns to live with change\". Mr Ashdown will argue that con- stitutional reform, including a commitment to proportional representation, is an essential precondition of such success. Mr Wilson, who enthused an unusually sober conference with bursts of colourful rheto- ric, said that his party's \"Big Idea\" for the election was to transform Britain's \"corrupt\" political system permanently by transferring power to the people. He launched a fierce attack on the \"arrogance and cynicism\" of the present struc- ture - one which allowed min- isters, industrialists and civil servants to insulate themselves from the hlrsh realities faced by ordinary citizens. On campaign tactics, Mr Wil- son said Liberal Democrat hopes rested on persuading the electorate that there was no possibility of Labour achieving the 8 per cent swing it needed to form a government Once teat message got across, disaffected Tories could vote for Mr Ashdown without fear of letting in a Labour gov- ernment. The strategy marks an acknowledgement that the SDP/Liberal Alliance suffered from that perception in the 1987 election. Almost all the Liberal Democrats' target seats were, and still are, Tory-held. Mr Wilson also gave a glimpse of his irritation with the attention the media has paid this week to the possibill- ties of an result which left both the Tories and Labour without an overall majority. In a coded sideswipe at Mr Ashdown's pri- vate discussions with journal- ists on the issue, Mr Wilson told the conference that his strategy would be to fight for every vote in every seat. \"There will be no deals or pacts to help any other party, and we are not, repeat not, interested in spending the elec- tion talking about the balance of power,\" he said. Referring to the speculation about a hung parliament that dogged the Alliance in 1987, he added: \"I say to the party - and Paddy and I are as one on this - there could be no greater folly than allowing ourselves to engage in endless theorising about it. If we do, we'll blow the election like we blew the last one\". Mr Ashdown, however, will return to the subject today by insisting in his speech that if the result of the election is inconclusive it would be \"undemocratic and destabilis- ing\" for Mr Major or Mr Kin- nock to seek to form a minor- ity government. His aim is to his pre- empt, even at this early stage, the possibility that the Liberal Democrats might be blamed by the electorate if they helped vote down a minority govern- ment after an inconclusive election.

   "text_content" : "ly David Owen THE conference yesterday endorsed a series of environ- mental measures, including higher energy taxation and the introduction of tradeable emis- sion licences, as part of its drive to promote the principle of \"sustainable development\". The Liberal Democrats sought to portray themselves as the most trustworthy of the three biggest parties in terms of environmental stewardship. Leading the debate, Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, said: \"We believe it is about time a political party in this country seriously competing for power offered a comprehensive solu- tion to the environmental cri- sis, rather than adding a tinge of green when it is in vogue.\" Other measures endorsed by the delegates included: * creation of a British Envi- ronmental Protection Agency to operate closely with the European Environment Agency; * provision of government subsidies for investment and activities which reduce pollu- tion and conserve resources; * use, where appropriate, of regulations such as standards for energy efficiency and prod- uct labelling; * adoption of a range of indi- cators of \"sustainability\" and quality of life as measures of development, with an annual prime ministerial report to par- liament on progress made in meeting these targets. Mr Hughes sought to pre- empt disquiet expressed by del- egates from remote rural areas about the possible effect of some of the party's policies. He referred to its previous agreement that compensating measures would be introduced to ensure account was taken of remote areas' transport needs. \"We are considering, for example, as a compensating measure the option of lower excise duties for people living in rural areas,\" he said. \"People in rural areas should not pay more as a proportion of their income for necessary journeys than they do now.\" Mr Hughes predicted that \"certain energy prices\" would go up, reflecting scarcity and the degree of pollution caused. \"It is our policy that one of our objectives is to reduce the amount of petrol we consume. One way of doing this is to increase taxation on petrol and then ensure that prices keep pace with inflation,\" he said. The conference voted in favour of the taxing of \"pollu- tion-causing and resource- depleting products, starting as a first priority with energy\".",

   "text_content" : "THE campaigner with a behind-the-scenes role for the Alliance during the 1987 election is now centre- stage for the Liberal Demo- crats general election cam- paign. During his 18 months' unpaid work as the party's campaign director, Mr Des Wil- son has come increasingly into the spotlight. He sees his role now as comparable to that of Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, and Mr Jack Cun- ningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator. His putative counterparts do not see it that way, and it is far from clear that all his col- leagues do either. Some sus- pect he sees himself too much as the second lead to Mr Paddy Ashdown at the expense of oth- ers in the supporting cast, such as Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president. A highly developed sense of drama, which perhaps derives from his days running the local amateur dramatic society in his New Zealand home town, contributes to an enjoyably over-the-top performance for his conference audience, but makes him less than a twin soul of Lord Holme of Chelten- ham, a more sober figure, who will draft the manifesto. His reasons for doing an encore, despite his experience in the shambolic campaign four years ago, chronicled in his book Battle for Power, seem broadly: commitment to Mr Ashdown, guilt at having been part of the collective lead- ership when the Liberal/SDP merger failed, and the thrill of running yet another campaign. He already has a formidable list of campaign credits: for unleaded petrol, against the sale of tobacco to under-16- year-olds, on behalf of the Opren victims, for freedom of information, for the environ- ment, and - perhaps best known - on behalf of the homeless with the launch of Shelter in 1966. He has also been a journal- ist, worked for the Royal Shakespeare Company and written a steamy novel, Costa del Sol, the title of which was deliberately chosen to sell well in airport bookshops. Publica- tion of his second novel, Cam- paign, is being held up by the election, which colleagues believe he hoped to see in June. Some suspect he sees himself too much as the second lead to Mr Ashdown, at the expense of others in the supporting cast Recognising that campaign- ing for a party was different from running a pressure group, he insisted when he took on the role that he should have complete control of all resources. \"Paddy has not gone back on that,\" he says proudly. Though his campaigning rep- utation was built on good notices for enthusing volun- teers and mapping out grand designs, one parliamentary col- league admits that he is \"more organised than you might think\". Some, though not all, of this is attributed to his dep- uty, Mr Alec McGiven, a long- time Liberal party campaigner. His management skills are more in doubt when working with colleagues who are roughly of equal status. \"He has an incredible ego, but he just doesn't realise\", one party worker commented, almost with admiration. He is said not to have understood why his game plan for dealing with a general election announcement during the conference - envis- aging a rally with short speeches from the leaders of the Scottish and Welsh Liberal Democrats, and speeches from himself and Mr Ashdown - drew laughter from members of the conference committee. Nor was it an act of sensitiv- ity to speak so damningly of the last election campaign, with Sir David Steel, the Lib- eral leader at that time, listen- ing on the platform. Sir David had just had to sum up the constitutional reform debate in a few min utes, while Mr Wilson had 30 minutes for his campaign pre- sentation. Despite the emphasis in his speech on changing the politi- cal system, he sees no contra- diction between that and his not standing for election on the grounds that by campaigning he is doing the best thing for the party. He did have a cameo as a parliamentary candidate, fight- ing the safe Tory seat of Hove in a by-election in 1973 and the February 1974 general election. He improved the party's perfor- mance before being dropped in favour of a more moderate can- didate \"in a suit\" who promptly lost 6,000 votes in the October election. He draws the moral that was his message to conference last year there are limits to the amount of support you can win by being inoffen- sive. Professing no plans beyond the election, the amount of support the party wins could well determine whether the campaign is his last bow.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy he help of Arthur Daley, star of British television's Minder, is being sought for what some hope is a final assault on the net book agreement - the vol- untary agreement under which most publishers set minimum retail prices for most books In the UL George Cole - who plays Daley, the fictional spiv-like character always on the look- out for \"a nice little earner\", is publishing his autobiography. Reed Consumer Books, the publisher, hopes that the book will not only turn out to be a nice little earner for them but will also have a bit part to play in the way books are mar- keted in the UK. Earlier this year Richard Charkin, chief executive of Reed Consumer Books, one of the big four publishers in the UK, decided to publish all his books \"non-net\" - outside the net book agreement. This meant that booksellers were free to sell Reed books at a discount. For Charkin it was not a matter of some great ideologi- cal change of heart. As he explained earlier this year, around 90 per cent of his books were already being pub- lished non-net. For Terry Maher, chairman of Pentos, the company that owns bookshop chains includ- ing Dillons, Charkin's decision has provided an unprece- dented degree of leverage in his almost obsessional cam- paign to overturn the NBA. So far in his campaign Maher has: failed to persuade the Office of Fair Trading to Intervene; been unable to per- suade either the government or the majority of both book- sellers and publishers, who remain either unconvinced or unwilling, to take action. Last year he deliberately breached the NBA by offering the Booker Prize shortlist titles at discounted prices until he was prevented by High Court injunctions from doing so. Despite the many rebuffs, Maher believes the game is going his way and that the book world will come to accept his arguments that discount- ing will sell more books - not just more of the discounted books but more \"full price\" books sold to those attracted Into the stores by the public- ity. \"It's the beginning of the end. The net book agreement will wither on the vine,\" says Maher - a pioneer of the mod- ernisation of UK bookselling. In the latest stage of the campaign, around 40 Reed titles will be discounted by an average 25 per cent and heavily advertised on televi- sion in the weeks running up to the Booker Prize dinner on October 22. Several Reed books under the company's Secker and Heinemann imprints are plausible candi- dates for the Booker shortlist. Maher clearly hopes that Reed books will do better in Pentos bookshops - account- ing for around 5 per cent of the market - this autumn and that other bookshops will be persuaded to follow. The next stage of the Maher game plan is that if Reed books start doing disproportionately well, then another of the big four, perhaps Rupert Murdoch's Harper Collins, might fall into line. Another straw in the wind is the fact that Tom Rosenthal, managing director of Andre Deutsch, a long-time supporter of the NBA, is to publish one novel, The Soldier and the Red-Haired Woman, non-net, clearly as an experiment. Tim Waterstone, founder of Waterstones bookshops which are now owned by W.H.Smith, is a supporter of the NBA which he describes as a system that creates an orderly mar- ket. He acknowledges, how- ever, \"that there is going to be a bit of a battle\" and that if Waterstones starts losing mar- ket share to Dillons, Water- stone admits he could be goaded into a response. Sir Simon Hornby, the chair- man of W.H.Smith, has been writing unambiguous articles in support of the NBA; he argues that heavy book-buyers are relatively well educated and well-off and that price is not the main issue. Tim Hely-Hutchinson, man- aging director of Headline, an independent publisher, believes that most publishers are neutral about the NBA and are merely responding to the fact that 95 per cent of their customers - the bookshops - are against its abolition.",

   "text_content" : "\"GLAXO wins patent battle against SmithKline\" ran the Sunday newspaper headlines last month. Not bad publicity, given that drug companies are not allowed to promote their wares to the public. Not exactly true either, but Glaxo shares received an upwards shove anyway. \"Glaxo wins public relations battle against SmithKline,\" might have been nearer the mark. What had happened was that the US Patent and Trademark Office issued a \"preliminary ruling\" that Glaxo had discov- ered a chemical, now sold under the trade name Zofran, that helped prevent nausea and vomiting. It is used to combat the side-effects of che- motherapy in the treatment of cancer. Glaxo published a press release on the news and reaped much favourable media cover- age. The company conceded privately that the ruling was a formality. SmithKline says it discov- ered that a whole group of drugs, to which Zofran belongs, prevented nausea. It will take at least two years of legal argument before there is a final ruling. Media coverage might not sway patent offices, but drug companies think it boosts internal morale. To see in print that, for example, Zantac is the world best-selling drug encour- ages the Glazo sales force. It might also inspire more doc- tors to join their colleagues (mostly in the US) to become Glaxo shareholders. To some industry observers it also indicates that battle lines are being drawn in a new arena: the selling of prescrip- Hon drugs to the public. It is still early days. The likes of SmithKline, Fisons and Wellcome have plenty of branded products. They are sold over the counter without prescription and promoted in the usual ways. But marketing skills needed to sell over the counter are next-to-useless when it comes to selling pre scription drugs because most standard promotional tech- niques are forbidden. The code of practice for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry says: \"Statements must not be made for the purpose of encouraging members of the public to ask their doctors to prescribe a product.\" Regulation in the rest of the European Commu- nity keeps companies on an even tighter rein. Rules in the US are a little looser. They have left enough room for Wellcome, for exam- ple, to run television commer- cials which suggest that herpes victims need suffer no more - they should visit their doctors and learn something to their advantage. Wellcome produces the best herpes treatment, Zovirax, but does not mention it in the commercial. Recently a new, powerful and unlikely medium for push- ing pharmaceuticals has begun to make its presence felt. The Stock Exchange's rule book says that \"information which might reasonably be expected to have a material effect on. . .prices of listed securi- ties\" should be immediately released. This is intended to give all shareholders simulta- neous access to price-sensitive data and to encourage publica- tion where secrecy might help the few in the know. This is a unique loophole through which drug promotion can be squeezed. Not only can information on new drugs be slotted into the media, but it is all right to reveal information on drugs still in development. Glaxo has led the way, most spectacularly with its migraine treatment sumatriptan (sold as Imigran). The challenge with any migraine drug is to get patients into the surgery - victims usually swallow an analgesic at home. On May 17, Glaxo announced, through the Lon- don Stock Exchange, that the Netherlands had approved sumatriptan. About 10 per cent of people suffer from migraine. With that much potential inter- est, press coverage spread to the mass-market newspapers. Initial reporting of the new treatment was uncritical. The subject is technical and dead- lines are tight. The temptation for reporters is simply to say what the drug can do. The effect on share prices is undeniable. Glaxo's jumped on the sumatriptan approval. Wellcome's almost doubled in a few days in the summer of 1989 on the prospects for its Aids treatment Retrovir. Over the past few months, Fisons' shares have performed errati- cally. They have been carried on the tides of sentiment over the likely date for approval of its asthma treatment Tilade by the US Food and Drug Admin- istration. Glaxo has signalled its deter- mination to beef up marketing of prescription drugs. Ernest Mario, its chief executive, has called several times this year for an easing of controls on drug advertising. But in the face of increasing EC restrictions on drug adver- tising, industry watchers expect many more announce- ments from investor relations departments and on the screens of those receiving news of quoted companies.",

   "text_content" : "General practitioners are more influenced than they care to admit by drug com- pany representatives over the drugs they prescribe and what the correct dose should be, recent research suggests. Such influence is perhaps surprising since many doctors also say they view drug sales staff as pushy, hard-sell merchants. Moreover, many say they do not trust the information reps give them on the drugs being promoted. Doctors like to believe that their prescribing habits are most influenced by medical journals, such as the Monthly Index of Medical Speciali- ties (Mims) or the British National Formulary. They regard such publications as more \"profes- sional\" than the \"commercial\" sources, like reps. Yet despite this distrust, two surveys* of gen- eral practitioners and drug company represen- tatives reveal that GPs are more influenced by reps in choosing the drugs they prescribe than by any other factor. The doctors were asked: * what sources they considered influenced their choice of drugs prescribed; and * what sources of information had been used for two specific products where these had been prescribed. The first question relied on GPs being objec- tive about the influences on them, but the second, relating to a specific event, is less judgmental. Answers to the first question placed drug reps near the bottom of the list of influences, below such concerns as patient preferences. The reps were viewed as \"minimally important\" by two- thirds of the doctors. But in answer to the second question, the drug company sales reps emerged as the main factor in persuading doctors to prescribe specific products. The results indicate that the reps' influence was much greater than the doctors thought - and was the main influence overall. But elsewhere in the survey, one doctor sales reps are mte main tactor in persuaaing aoctors to presncre specinic proaucis described the reps as \"a necessary evil\" and another said the relationship \"between pharma- ceutical reps and certain GPs is such that in my opinion it needs drastic changes\". More than two thirds of the doctors thought that at some time in the past year, a representa- tive had not known enough about a product he or she was selling; four out of five thought a rep had made less of a drug's side-effects than was clinically justified; and two thirds thought that a rep had claimed more uses for a drug than was justified. Justin Greenwood, senior lecturer on public administration at Teesside, surveyed 262 doctors from the Trent Health Authority area - a sample profile claimed to be roughly representa- tive of GPs across the UK. While the influence of the sales people must be good news for the drug company managers, the many criticisms expressed by their own employees suggest that drugs companies need to improve drastically the training they provide. The reps view themselves as being poorly trained - a central issue to emerge. They are unhappy with their own poor image and with aggressive colleagues who they believe are giv- ing the industry a bad name. One in four com- mented on the drug industry's poor image while 22 per cent said the industry had become \"all hard-sell\". A quarter of the reps complained of lack of respect from doctors and receptionists. This may be linked to the finding that only 29 per cent of the reps had any medical training and 23 per cent therapeutic training. Training-related issues made up 52 per cent of the reps' sugges- tions on how their relationship with GPs could be improved. Lack of training seems to be the reason for only 4 per cent of reps keeping up to date with changes to the ABPI Code of Practite, the self-regulating mechanism for the industry. Eight per cent reported promoting products to GPs on the phone, which contravenes the code and \"less than a fifth of the 151 who had been involved in the conduct of a clinical trial or post-marketing surveillance study appeared to be aware of the ABPI/BMA guidelines governing the industry's code in these areas,\" says the report. Greenwood suggests that a lot of the problems could be solved by a change of recruitment policy by the drug companies. Some older doc- tors who found it difficult to keep up with changes valued rapport built through long asso- ciations with certain reps. Yet the reps' survey showed a rapid turnover of staff, and that most reps were younger than the doctors they were dealing with. If companies took on more older reps with some medical background, Greenwood reckons, these people would be likely to have more understanding of a GP's situation, would be less likely to move on as quickly as aspiring gradu- ates and would be more respected by the doc- tors. *Marketing Medicines.

   "text_content" : "By Nornn Cohen, Investments Correspondent SHOULD shareholders have the right to know how much their company spent on their behalf to ward off a hostile takeover or to launch a bid for another company? And should that information be disclosed in regular company accounts or in filings before the takeover panel when the bid is launched? The Bank of England has found itself the somewhat unlikely agitator in a controversy that has lined up many of the nation's biggest institu- tional shareholders on its side, and risked antagonising its natural con- stituents, the merchant banks. The Bank has been circulating a paper to the Takeover Panel and to the accounting bodies suggesting that companies should make public the sums they pay their financial advisers in merger and acquisition activity. At the heart of the Bank's thinking is the nagging concern that if share- holders knew what a company was paying for advice, it would affect per- ceptions of the wisdom of the bid. While all investment banks are obliged to give the best possible advice to clients, it might be argued that the thought of hefty advisory fees might lead them to support an uneconomic bid. Furthermore, the Bank believes, even if shareholders ignore the information, there is sim- ply no justification for failing to inform them. The Bank's actions were prompted by the Â£1.lbn acquisition of Globe Investment Trust last year by the National Coal Board's pension fund manager, CIN Management. In that bid, Globe apparently struck a deal with its main advisers, Baring Brothers, that ultimately required David Tweedie: \"Our first question is who wants the Information?\" CIN to pay Baring about Â£4m once the acrimonious takeover was completed. Globe had structured the deal so that the fee was contingent not upon repel- ling the bid but upon receiving a bet- ter offer from CIN. CIN is said to have gone before the takeover panel and argued that the terms of that arrangement should have been disclosed because it consti- tuted a contingent liability - an argument which the panel rejected. Separately, the Takeover Panel also considered, but rejected, a Bank of England paper urging that fees be dis- closed routinely in takeovers. The panel decided that the takeover code could only cover matters occurring during the takeover. For one thing, fees are often dependent on the out- come of a takeover and are not easily quantifiable until the deal is either completed or abandoned. However, the proposals may get a better hearing at the Accounting Standards Board, where they are among many new disclosure require- ments currently under consideration. Professor David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said that in making any decision on the matter the ASB must first consider \"materiality\". \"Our first question is who wants the informa- tion.\" In order to meet the criteria, the sums must not only be significant, but also make a difference to those using the information. The board must consider whether shareholders could have reached a different conclu- sion about the rationality of a bid knowing what a company paid its advisers. If the information was merely interesting, the matter could not be said to be material. On the other hand, if the informa- tion was material while a bid was underway, what was the point of only disclosing it in interim or year-end accounts? By that time the fate of the bid may well have been decided and it would be too late for shareholders to consider the matter of fees. For the investment banking indus- try the disclosure of fees is a highly sensitive matter. Mr David Smith, managing director at SG Warburg and chairman of the corporate finance committee of the British Merchant Bankers' Association, said the group would probably not oppose the disclo- sure of aggregate fees in a takeover - meaning a statement giving the lump sum paid to all advisers including accountants, lawyers, public relations consultants as well as investment banks. But disclosing the terms of advisory fees in the middle of a hostile bid was quite another matter. \"Disclosure of the fee basis could give an advantage to the other side in a hostile take- over,\" he argued. Merchant banks could point to the weak takeover dis- closure requirements of their conti- nental competitors to support this. Investment bankers have little desire to see their fees splashed across the pages of the nation's financial press. They argue that the sums paid are insignificant relative to the size of bids and that shareholders already have too much information to digest during the course of a bid. Corporations, meanwhile, have a different perspective. Mr Hugh Col- lum, finance director at SmithKline Beecham and chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors, notes that in the US, fees are always dis- closed in the course of a bid. The merger of US-based SmithKline Beck- man with Beecham in 1989 did not suffer at all from disclosure of invest- ment bankers fees. Disclosure consid- erations, he argues, could well apply to all fees in a merger. \"When they have knock-on effects in the transac- tion, you could argue that they should be disclosed.\" Meanwhile, Mr Collum noted that disclosure of US investment banking fees had neither inhibited merger activity there nor moderated the fee structure. Indeed, US advisory fees were often significantly above those in the UK.",

   "text_content" : "TRUE IDENTITY (15) Odeon Leicester Square REGARDING HENRY (12) Cannons West End ONLY THE LONELY (12) Plaza WEEKEND (18) Renoir True Identity is an amiable little comedy that nonetheless pro- vides too few outlets for Lenny Henry's high pow- ered talent. In it, the versatile comedian plays a struggling New York actor who can only get auditions for stereotypical black roles. When he finally lands what he thinks is a part in Raisin in the Sun, he ends up playing a raisin in a bowl for a breakfast cereal commer- cial. To makes matters worse, Henry soon finds himself being hunted by a mafia don (Frank Langella) who has mistakenly confided his identity to the actor. Fortunately, Henry's best buddy, a make-up artist (Charles Lane, who also directed), provides him with the ultimate disguise - he does him over as a white man. What follows is an unexcep- tional story of love and mis- taken identity, ending with Henry getting the girl, his man and the lead in Othello. 'It is not a bad romp, aided considerably by Henry's infec- tious manner and some decent one-liners from writer Andy Breckman. The film's real heroes, however, are make-up artists Jon Caglione Jr and Doug Drexler, who somehow 'True Identity': Lenny Henry in disguise manage to transform Henry into a credible Caucasian. He has considerable fun with the role, putting on the manner- inms and accent of a swagger- ing Las Vegas wlseguy mobster with occasionally alarming perfection. You have to pinch yourself to remember that it is Henry in there. Unfortunately, the film mak- ers do little with this technical coup, using it merely to make a few limp stabs at social com- mentary and some fleetingly funny double entendres. The best sort of statement they can come up with is to have Henry use his white face to hail a cab for an ignored brother. Satire is replaced by penis jokes and chastisement of overt racists. You get the feeling Lane can- not decide whether he wants to make a movie in the style of Eddie Murphy or Spike Lee, and has failed to realise you cannot do both. It's a shame that he and his writer were not as deft as their make-up team. Regarding Henry is a film about amnesia which is just as soon forgotten. It is hard to believe that Harrison Ford and director Mike Nichols could produce such a mawkish, clumsy bit of cinema as this. In it, Ford plays a high-flying, heartless New York lawyer who crushes the little guy on behalf of big business clients. Not only that, but he also browbeats his 12-year-old daughter with Latin legal jar- gon and speaks to his wife (Annette Bening) as if taking a deposition from her. Everything changes, how- ever, when he is gunned down by a mugger and left with a damaged brain. A prolonged process of recovery ensues, during which Ford not only Amnesic: Harrison Ford and Bill Nunn in 'Regarding Henry' relearns the basics of speech and motion, but also undergoes a sentimental and ethical edu- cation. He rediscovers the beauty of his wife and child while rejecting the amoral machinations of his career. In one scene he even stops to smell a flower. By film's end he Is a new man, a bit slow on tne uptake perhaps, but possessing a heart of gold. You can see the appeal of such a story, although you also would have thought that the man who brought us Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? would have been aware of its potential pitfalls. Nichols, how- ever, stumbles right into sev- eral of them, crafting a movie whose tone is hopelessly senti- mental and whose outlook is strictly two-dimensional. Screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams should shoulder equal blame for a script whose message seems taken from a high school essay. Too many of these characters we have see before, such as the hip black physio who jolts our hero from his self-pity, or the unquestion- ingly resolute wife, or the wise- before-her-time daughter. There is even a puppy to lick Ford's hand when the going gets tough. The final family reconciliation on the steps of an American Gothic church looks like something Norman Rockwell would have consid- ered too corny to paint. Ford has some good moments nevertheless, espe- cially when he wakes from his coma to gawk at the world with the stupefied, drooling awe of a five month old. But he never really succeeds in chart- ing his character's recovery and rebirth - there are just too many great leaps forward for it all to be credible. Bening also does well, though you can- not help but wish for just a bit of the brashness that made her so fine in The Grifters. And Bill Nunn as the streetwise physio brings some real energy to his performance, especially when he warns Ford against self-pity and sentimentality. His words seem distinctly out of place in so saccharine a film. Sentimentality rules in Only the Lonely as well, though at least here it is mixed with enough humour to make it rea- sonably palatable. This is director Chris Columbus's first film since Home Alone, which inexplicably became the high- est grossing comedy of all time. While this is too subdued a film to reach those heights, it should provide some laughs for those who like their comedy with a soft centre. John Candy plays Danny Muldoon, a Chicago policeman who, at the age of 38, still lives with his mother (Maureen O'Hara in a rare screen appear- ance). He appears set for life- long bachelorhood when he meets Theresa (Ally Sheedy), the shy girl who makes up the corpses at the local mortuary. They fall in love, though the path to marriage is blocked by O'Hara, an opinionated, cling- ing Irish woman who cannot bear to lose her son. A consid- erable amount of squabbling and soul-searching ensue, though Columbus really doesn't have much to say other than a boy's gotta leave home to become a man. What makes the film engag- ing is its gentle observational humour, such as they way Theresa makes up the dead to resemble movie stars, or the scene in which Candy uses his great bulk to sneak his lover past his mother. Candy's act- ing is a revelation as well - he's grown from a chuckling fat guy who brings comic relief to an actor capable of centring a film. Nearly a quarter century after its initial release, Jean- Luc Godard's Weekend remains a savagely funny indictment of bourgeois life. Although it shows its age in spots, the overall effect remains starkly deracinating. For those who haven't seen it, the film tells g nenry the story of a venal couple, Corinne (Mireille Dare) and Roland (Jean Yanne), as they journey from Paris to southern France to cash in on Roland's dying father's inheritance. It is a trek that takes them through a nightmarish landscape lit- tered with horrific car crashes, ranting historical figures and some very nasty guerrillas. They finally reach their desti- nation to discover that dad is dead and mom isn't about to come across with the loot. So, they kill her and grab the money. Their trip back to Paris ends abruptly when they are kidnapped by cannibalistic rev- olutionaries, who disembowel Roland and indoctrinate Cor- inne. What makes Weekend's power so enduring is the way Godard was able to heighten so grotesquely the violence, mate- rialism and moral emptiness of Western society without for a moment making you forget that it is us he is targeting. The justifiably famous traffic jam sequence, in which the camera passes along carload after carload of squabbling commuters and the horrific wreck that holds them up with the same numb dispassion, remains a masterfully jarring and resonant cinematic moment. Even Godard's more bizarre scenes are saved by savage irony, such as when Corinne and Roland pick up a hitch- hiker who is capable of mira- cles, yet can only ask him to grant them the most hideously banal wishes. The film's Maoist and anti-American rantings do seem be be locked in the 1960s, though Godard distances some of the dogma by having it delivered by telepathic dustbin men. The last two decades may have rendered Godard's anar- chic solutions untenable, but they have done nothing to dim the brilliance of the light he sheds upon our problems. Stephen Amidon",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL COURT At the start of Timberlake Wertenbaker's tremendous new play an art auctioneer runs through his patter: having knocked down a \"totally flat, authentically white\" canvas to the highest bidder he begins on an illuminated billboard which proclaims: \"Art is money sexy social-climbing fantastic.\" The stage is set, one fears, for another of those slick, self-congratulatory diatribes against the state of the arts and society. The first act scenario would seem to bear that out as the characters introduce themselves, against Sally Jacobs' witty set of post-modernist perspex walls backed by Constable-esque treescapes. There is Patti Love's tough Alex, commodity-broking dealer from the US (\"My company was too late to save New York but we can still save England\"); there is Jeremy (Robin Soans), whose genteely ailing gallery is the focus of her fire; and there is Biddy, the bimbo from Benenden, lucratively married to a socially ambitious Greek millionaire. Where Biddy is concerned, though, first appearances are immediately shown to be deceptive. In a wry comic monologue, superbly played by Harriet Walter, she exposes the venal prejudices of her class without ever quite losing her soul to them. This spark of self-recognition, of healing honesty, is fanned into a great spiritual bonfire on to which are piled the false idols of post-modernism. Biddy likes the work of Francis Bacon because she feels \"recognised\" by it; she likes landscapes because they make her feel good. Naive and self-effacing, her buying power gives her the clout to embark on a tentative crusade for meaningful art. Through this touching and revealing character Wertenbaker pushes beyond the familiar representation of money as an intrinsically corrupting force. Sure, there are the Lady Lelouches of this world, but patronage also - as Prince Charles would tell you - brings with it an innocent discrimination which, like it or loathe it, is revealed in the play as leading the genuine artist back to genuine art. Robbed of her Greek husband by his body's rejection of a Turkish kidney, Biddy sits, in sculptural elegance, for a painter whose classical values had put him out of vogue, but who suddenly finds himself inspired and valued again. The sore and angry painter is alikened to the Greek hero Philoctetes, stranded on a desert island with a gangrenous foot, who is wooed back to civilisation by the emissary of his enemy. Wertenbaker writes fluently and funnily, with a fearless capacity to expand an apparently limited canvas into a portrait of the times, which is held by director Max Stafford-Clark in a fine balance between character and caricature. The cosmopolitan jumble extends to sundry rich and stupid Americans, a culturally confused Indian art dealer (Shirin Taylor), Biddy's naively ambitious Greek husband (David Bamber), and a diminutive Romanian (Allan Corduner) who bumbles around demanding help for his country. Clive Russell plays the dispossessed artist Stephen with a raw, almost Lawrentian cussedness that is eloquently framed by Walter's proud and beautiful diffidence. Claire Armitstead",

That is followed by the edition of On The Line, postponed from last week, reporting on the rise and fal of Dynamo Berlin, a club run by the Stasi, the East German secret police. The team is now in the non- league third division. Having repeated their fascinating set of documentaries about the life of steeplejack and steam engine freak Fred Dibnah, BBC2 adds an update in A Year With Fred (8.W0), showing him with his new wife, who likes stean engines, and his young son.

   "text_content" : "THE PIT, BARBICAN After the quiet charm of Thornton Wilder's Our Town at the Shaftesbury, here by coincidence is another slice of American family life presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Sam Shepard's Curse of the Starving Class is set in one of the poorer, but developing parts of California, not too far from the Mexican border. This is life in the raw, although the wounds are largely self-inflicted. The white family involved are not poor, or so they keep telling you, but \"somewhere in between\". They have two cars, some land on which the specu- lators have their eyes, and the daughter goes to a school which requires a uniform. They are hungry mainly because of an ability to get round to buying anything much to eat. A huge refrigerator is a prominent part of the set. It is nearly always empty, but that does not stop the family almost ritually opening and closing it to check. Sometimes they even talk to it. The father, played by John McEnery, is an alcoholic. \"Starving\" is thus a meta- phor: apart from the food, it is never quite clear what they are starved of. Perhaps it is simply that the American Dream fails to live up to expectations. That explains the \"curse\" as the reverse side of the dream. The play contains a great of shouting: indeed the text demands it - some of it is written in block capitals. There is an act of urination on stage, which some people will not like. A lamb is taken off stage to be slaughtered, though the skinned and bloody corpse is brought back, so don't say you have not been warned that this is not Our Town. For my part, however, I found that my interest was sustained throughout. True, the property sharks in so far as they appear are simply cyphers. But the family of four - father, mother, son and daughter - have sufficient dif- ferences, and also similarities, between them for the interplay always to be fascinating. All of them except the son, who is unambitiously content where he is, are looking for some- thing that they don't have. I should add that it ends in tears, to put it mildly. Shepard was an actor before he was a playwright and is much influenced by jazz, mod- ern American art and cinema. His Angel City was shown at the small Grove Theatre in London W10 last last month. The style is refreshingly casual - extending to frying eggs on stage - despite some of the intensity of Curse. As a venue, The Pit is ideal. McEnery has an especially strong scene playing the father when drunk. Susan Fleetwood is the mother, George Anton the son and Alex Kingston the daughter. An unhappy family, they play remarkably well together. The direction is by Robin Lefevre and the set, by Kenny Miller, captures the mixture of outdoor and kitchen life that is essential to a household at the end of the line. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "BARBICAN THEATRE To take the best, first: the performance by Alex Jennings as the king in the Royal Shake- speare Company's production of Richard II, which opened in Stratford in November and has now arrived at the Barbican, is outstanding. This is not the sort of King Richard you nor- mally see, or expect. For a start, Jennings is taller than anyone else on stage. His Rich- ard is neither effeminate, nor effete. He has a commanding presence throughout. He retains to the end an innate self-confidence and belief in his own superiority. He even fights off some of the murderers before he finally falls. If this Richard went to school, he was probably good at games. The rather paradoxical key to the Jennings performance is that the character does not change much as the play goes on. It is the circumstances that alter. When he first appears, there is no suggestion that he is surrounded by sycophants. He may take the wrong deci- sions and do so in an arbitrary way, but at least he seems to be his own man. He is a politi- cian who would prefer concilia- tion to conflict. Then there is the dramatic shift from public life to private. Richard at home behaves in a quite different way from Rich- ard on the throne. He has favourites and shows his con- tempt of the people he has to govern and the ducal equiva- lents of his cabinet ministers. As a political figure, he is in a recognisable tradition. When the odds turn against him, he keeps his belief in his own divine right, but he does it with a kind of teasing arro- gance rather than a self-pitying whimper. There are two ways in which he is superior to the people around him. One is that he speaks better and more imaginative verse: the other is that even the usurpers have a sneaking belief in his right to rule. He knows a lot about horses, from the stable to the grave. The best moment in Jennings's generally superb performance is when he speaks the incomparable lines about Bolingbroke riding to his coro- nation on Richard's favourite Alastair Muir Alex Jennings steed, roan Barbary: \"That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand...Would he not stumble?\" The rest of the production is uneven. While Richard II is obviously a history play, pav- ing the way for the Henrys, its style and verse tend to concen- trate more on Richard himself. Ron Daniels' direction empha- sises the political contents and the forecasts of troubles to come. This works with Anton Lesser as Bolingbroke, who has his doubts about the future even as he takes over the throne. Few of the other char- acters, however, have the maturity of those in the later plays. Alan MacNaughtan as John of Gaunt speaks the famous lines about the state of England as if he means them, but again this is a one-off speech. Where does this curi- ous idea of an ideal England, to which one should be for ever looking back, come from? It has had a most pernicious effect on our culture. Valentina Yakunina's queen is a disaster because she plays the part in a pronounced stage- French accent that further slows the pace. The production as a whole takes any chance to reduce the speed. I also wonder if it is sensible to have practi- cally every character, save Richard, dressed in black. The fascist/stalinist touch in the production is a touch over- done. Still, the Jennings perfor- mance makes up for a very great deal. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALBRT HALL, RADIO 3 The last of the Proms commissions for 1991 was introduced on Tuesday in the BBC Symphony Orchestra's programme with Andrew Davis. Hugh Wood's Piano Concerto proves not to be at all the dour, intensely serious argument that his previous concertos, for violin and cello, might have suggested, but a positively extrovert three- movement piece, full of meaty, flamboyant solo writing marked with an insistent jazzy tang. In the most superficial jour- nalistic shorthand the concerto could be characterised as twelve-note Ravel. The sonata- form first movement follows a jagged, explosive opening with a reflective, bluesy second sub- ject, and even when the music unfurls the kind of chromatic line one recognises from Wood's earlier music, its inten- sity might be mitigated by a sensuous horn call, a fondly turned woodwind solo or an outburst of Messiaen-like piano chords. The variations that make up the central movement support the piano's added-sixth tinged stream of consciousness on a web of luminous orchestral lines until the theme wells up to the surface, first in the strings. It turns out to be the 1920s perennial \"Sweet Lor- raine\", and then the piano can reveal its pristine form, in a Bill Evans-like meditation. The concerto was written for Joanna MacGregor, a former pupil of Wood at Cambridge. She give this premiere with wonderful gusto, turning the episodes of the final rondo, pro- pulsive and languorous by turn, into a gallery of swiftly sketched character pieces. It is an attractive, rewarding con- certo, and its exuberance and technical challenge clearly owes much to her example. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "ONE disconcerting symptom of this year's stock market rally has been a wave of \"business as usual\" rights issues - calls on shareholders for more cash in order to allow a company to go on doing what it is doing already. Rights issues of this sort - such as yesterday's Â£432m call from British Aerospace - raise a number of concerns. A rights issue can easily be justified to finance some pressing new investment project. It can also be justified, with caution, for a rescue package that accompa- nies a wholesale redirection of the company and a change of management. But it is hard to see why shareholders should stump up for a rights issue that allows the same management to pur- sue the same strategy that cre- ated the need for cash in the first place, unless the share price is showing convincing relative strength. In particular, companies too often provide only the sketchiest information on why the money is needed. Each individual case is dif- ferent, of course, and manage- ments can usually find argu- ments why their own need for money is uniquely justified. In the British Aerospace case, for example, a drying up of cash advances for defence contracts creates a once-for-all shift in the need for working capital. Lavish scale More generally, however, the question arises of whether the rights issue mechanism pro- vides sufficient discipline on companies. It is curious that at a time when institutional shareholders appear more will- ing to take their corporate gov- ernance duties seriously - a trend exemplified by a rash of boardroom departures earlier this year - they should also be willing to provide business-as- usual cash on a lavish scale. So far this year, over Â£7bn has been raised in rights issues; by the end of December, the total is likely to reach Â£10bn. A back-of-the-envelope calculation by James Capel, the broker, suggests that roughly three quarters of those issues have been made for \"repair\" rather than invest- ment purposes. It is open to question whether that cash is efficiently allocated in an economic sense. A company's rights issue potential is dictated by the size of its current market capitalis- ation; that reflects the City's expectations of profitability from its current asset base, but is not necessarily an accurate guide to the profitability of its marginal investment opportu- nities. A rights issue system which operates smoothly but unquestioningly to meet corpo- rate calls for cash may not be allocating capital properly. Timing problem There is also a problem of timing. Once the economic recovery is fully under way, a second round of capital-raising is likely, this time for more appropriate purposes. Compa- nies which avoided \"repair\" rights issues this year may next year approach their share- holders to raise money for acquisitions or for the working capital needed for revived lev- els of business activity. With institutional cash levels sharply lower - partly because of this year's rights issues - next year's cash-rais- ing exercises may prove con- siderably more difficult. Yet arguably next year's requests will have a more legitimate claim on institutional money than this year's. The London market's mecha- nism for underwritten rights issues is traditionally seen as a great strength, allowing large amounts of money to be raised smoothly and cheaply. Yet it is reasonable to ask whether the very smoothness of the mecha- nism is not itself undesirable. It has been oiled this year by leaks about imminent cash calls in a way that eases the underwriting process - by pushing down the share price - and ensures that even the most implausible rights issue finds underwriters and pur- chasers. Institutions have proved jeal- ous defenders of the system of pre-emption rights that under- pins the London underwriting mechanism, basing their argu- ment on the unanswerable moral case of ownership. This year's experience argues that if they wish the system to be as Justifiable on economic grounds, they must steel them- selves, as underwriters and investors, to demand much more information - and to say no more often.",

   "text_content" : "PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico enters the second half of his six-year term with a deservedly strengthened man- date to further the economic reforms introduced in the early part of his presidency. The success of his Institu- tional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the Mexican mid-term elections has removed many of the doubts about Mr Salinas's political legitimacy that fol- lowed allegations of wide- spread ballot-rigging at the 1988 presidential elections. Although electoral fraud sur- faced again this year, there is no doubt about the resurgence of support for the PRI. Behind this success lies the restoration of growth to a country which has been starved of it for so long. The reforms have been broader and deeper than many imagined possible. Mr Salinas has bro- ken many taboos: seeking a free-trade agreement with the US and Canada, privatising a large proportion of national- ised industries and tackling the entrenched power of the trade unions. Despite this, the vote for the left collapsed in the latest elections: a signal that will not go unnoticed in other parts of Latin America. Combined with an agree- ment which lightened the country's debt burden, the reforms have helped to restore eouomnic confidence and have pteda dramatic return of as well as a sharp rie in foreign investment. Rpid tmnsition Mexico's progress inace Mr silnes took over has been so rapid that many observers, .induding foreign investors, are making comparisons with spain end its rapid transition anto a modern economy. But VI Mr Sallnas wants to follow the Spanish example, he has two main challenges to advance his economic reform pro- gtWaume and ensure its irret and to rid the co=u rj etioÂ·fraud. k the the inflows of cap - Mexcoe are important m- widoame, a lare portion of tem are nevitably volatile hadf wiech cod exit rid. As much as a0 per cent of desut capital inflows into eleko are short-term in W ttese caropia bfow bring their own problems, notably in the management of a monetary policy which will keep downward pressure on inflation, keeping these foot- loose funds in the country is an important short-term objec- tive. Fixing the peso to the dol- lar would send a strong signal to investors and allow further falls in Mexican interest rates. Restrictive law Converting the inward investment into long-term capi- tal will be significantly aided by repealing of the restrictive 1973 foreign investment law. It will also be encouraged by the completion of the North Ameri- can Free Trade Agreement, not least as a guarantee that the reforms survive Mr Salinas's term of office. The time may also be ripe to embark on reform of the country's ineffi- cient agricultural sector. Mr Salinas's supporters say with some justification that even he cannot tackle all Mexico's problems at once, and that significant progress towards a cleaner election pro- cess has already been made. The replacement of the ostensi- bly successful PRI candidate in the gubernatorial elections for Guanajuato, where cries of fraud at the election were among the loudest, has been widely applauded. But apart from demonstrating the presi- dent's political acumen, the move merely underlines the arbitrary nature of a process in which the president himself appears to decide who remainm in office and who does not. With the collapse of the Communist party in the Soviet Union, the PRI has now gov- erned for longer than any other political grouping in the world.

   "text_content" : "we years ago a smil- ing group of European executives from six countries gathered for a group photograph in the ruied Jordaian city ofPetra, where they were engaged in a corporate brainstorming ses- sion. The 29 executives, in sea- green jogging suits and belge anoraks and holdn hands to symbolise team spirit, stood on the steps outside the palace in the shape of an inverted pyra- mid, illustrating the intended structure of the new market- led packaging company, CMB Packaging, they were to forge: customers at the top, managers below. Now the idealism of those formative days is no more than a fading photograph in the cor- porate scrap book. The mar- riage between the packaging interests of the two former arch-competitors, Metalbox Packaging of Britain (a subsid- iary of MB Group) and Car- naud of France, has been plagued by dissension. The merger, which created Europe's largest packaging group and was supposed to provide a model for the bene- fits of cross-border industrial alliances, has instead exposed the difficulties of blending dif- ferent business cultures. Yesterday, these tensions culminated in the announce- ment that Mr Jean-Marie Des- carpentries, the colourful Frenchman who was the archi- tect of CMB Packaging, will quit as head of the group on November 8. The creation of CMB Packag- ing was presented as a classic example, of how to create a \"truly European company\" to respond to looming competi- tion from the US and Japan. Yet since the earliest days, it has suffered from friction between its British and French managers and a string of departures among its senior personnel. The merger has turned out to be far harder than even the most sceptical among its partners had origi- nally expected. Now the job of making peace falls to Mr Jurgen Hintz, a Ger- man-born American from Proc- ter & Gamble. CMB's owners hope that as a neutral outsider he will be able to reconcile the tensions and fulfil the high expectations that surrounded the original deal. What went so badly wrong? Recession in the UK certainly had an impact. CMB's profits unexpectedly fell by 14 per cent last year and French shareholders say CMB's operat- ing margins - 9 per cent in 1990 - are below target owing to higher-than-scheduled sinan- cing costs. The 6 per cent share of the European Community packaging market represented by CMB's FFr24.4bn (Â£2.44bn) turnover last year is well below the 10 per cent target it set itself. But something more funda- mental came unstuck - in part as a result of the complex- ity of melding two very differ- ent corporate cultures. The initial logic for the joint venture was sound enough. Carnaud, formed in the 1920s from the tin plate business of the Wendel family - a distin- guished French steel dynasty - needed Metalbox's research department and access to the UK market. Metalbox needed to become big enough to offer multinational customers world- wide deals on can pricing. The French partners were, P7 On the way out: Jean-Marie Descarpenlrles } ~;_\\L3 however, initially disappointed by the performance of the MB units; the British were anta- gonised by what they saw as Mr Descarpentries's high-handed management style, which blended an enthu- siasm for entrepreneurial tal- ent with the traditional ten- dency of a French patron to wield personal control as widely as possible. Mr Descarpentries is a typi- cal product of the French dlite - \"a beautiful example of the best and the worst of French management\", in the words of a former colleague. Trained at the prestigious Ecole Polytech- nique, he began his managerial career at the glassmaker Saint- Gobain, the training ground for several French manage- ment stars such as Francis Mer, chairman of the Usinor Sacilor steel giant, or Alain Gomez - like Mr Descarpen- tries a former army para- trooper - at Thomson, the defence and electronics group. Mr Ernest-Antoine Selllire, the urbane chairman of CGIP, the French investment group which contains the interests of the Wendel family, hired the brilliant young Descarpentries to turn round the then loss- making Carnaud in 1983. \"Mr Descarpentries dynamised peo- ple, made them feel responsible and gave them objectives,\" says a director of CGIP. All this suggested, at least to CGIP, that he should be the ideal man to bring a dash of Gallic elan to CMB's creation. In the event, his strategy was to chop up CMB into small profit centres, 29 at the start, but since enlarged to 50, organ- ised along a mixture of product and geographical lines. He added to this a confrontational personal style, making direct profit comparisons between dif- ferent units, and openly cate- gorising executives as real entrepreneurs or routine man- agers. The aim, he argued, was to create \"a community of entre- preneurs\". But British manag- ers accused the Frenchman - jokingly nicknamed Des Car- penter - of trying to divide and rule, of reducing CMB into units small enough to ensure his dominance. Non-French influence at the top of CMB was gradually whittled away, with last year's resignation of Mr Alex Watson as deputy chairman, followed by the appointment of Mr Bernard Rolley as finance director in place of Dutchman Rob Van den Heuvel. Mr Nigel Gilson remained as the only Briton on the four-man execu- tive board. British, si alo found it raed to.

However, he departed soon after the deal was completed, and partly. a, result confi- dence In the partnersip Pbegan to be eroded. The Frnch began to wonder about MB Group's long-term commitment to CMB following the British partner's decision in late 1989, soon after the deal, to buy Caradon, a UK maker of bathroom equipment, and to move many of Cara- don's managers into its own organisation. In recent months, however, a more, harmonious partnership has been formed between the French and British equity part- ners. Mr Peter Jansen, the internationally minded Dutch chief executive of MB Caradon Group, and Mr Seillire, an Anglophile former diplomat, have struck up a close working relationship which was yester- day formalised in the creation of the new company structure. Mr Jansen will become chair- man of an equity partners' committee while Mr Seillibre will head a supervisory board. Those close to MB Group dis- miss rumours that it wants to pull out of the arrangement. CGIP also says both partners will want to stay in at least until the group fulfils its mar- ket share and profitability fore- casts, in the next year or two. \"We both agree that we want to improve profitability. Per- haps when profitability is bet- ter one or both of us might sell, but there is no reason for either of us to be sellers today,\" says the CGIP official. Industry analysts still accept the industrial logic of merging the two companies, and even saddened former employees are convinced that the project will work. The stock market has taken the same view, lifting CMB's share price by 16.8 per cent over the past year, against an 8.1 per cent rise recorded by the Paris Bourse's CAC general index over the same period. Most analysts think CMB should be able to reduce its debts and curb other costs enough to allow profits to rise by around 15 per cent this year. Mr Jansen was certainly con- sident yesterday about the company's prospects, and vehe- mently defended the design drawn up by the much-ma- ligned Mr Descarpentries. \"I think that the expecta- tions that were expressed at the beginning of the merger were excessive. But I believe that Jurgen Hintz's meticulous management skills can imple- ment Jean-Marie's original vision,\" he said."

   "text_content" : "G ood men do not neces- sarily write good books. Mr Shevardnad- ze's short volume of memoirs, covering largely his period as Soviet foreign minister (1985-90), is disappointing on almost every level - factual, political and ideological. It is the more so because the author was, with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the joint architect of \"new thinking\" in Soviet foreign policy whose exercise, in the latter half of the 1980s, changed our world. One of his problems, which he shares with other Soviet memoir writers of the present period - including Mr Gorba- chev himself, Mrs Raisa Gorba- chev and Mr Boris Yeltsin - is that they did not just change, but completely shed an ideo- logical skin and assumed a new one. All the men were first secretaries of regional or republican communist parties - Mr Gorbachev in Stavropol, Mr Yeltsin in Sverdlovsk and Mr Shevardnadze in his native republic of Georgia. To take and keep that post required the imposition of a consistently authoritarian rule. They were the Big Bosses of a system which brooked neither opposi- tion nor dissent, and which served their party with parallel repressive structures in the secret police and interior min- istry (Mr Shevardnadze was Georgian interior minister). How they went from local tyrants to world heroes deserves an explanation: Mr Shevardnadze glosses it over - with regrets, certainly, and with a rueful sigh that he should have been so misled, but giving pride of place to his efforts to humanise the system and to alleviate the repressive features which he himself was responsible for keeping in place. Because the past is gutted of its real content, the change to the \"new thinking\" is left mys- terious. Mr Shevardnadze says that, in his early acquaintance with Mr Gorbachev when both were young Turks in the Kom- somol, and later when they were first secretaries of adja- cent areas, he found they were both sceptical about the Brezh- nevite policies and both wanted to change them when they could. But why? And how were they able to do it? What were their calculations as to the resistance they might meet, and to the allies they might be able to find? Instead of names, dates, places and occasions, we have assertions which appear to place the whole shift of thought of the Gorbachev lead- ership team in the sphere of voluntarism: the effort of will of a few pioneers. His period as foreign minis- ter, which takes up the bulk of the book, is more clearly described, but is very far indeed from the detailed mem- oirs or the ideological argu- ments of a Kissinger or a Brze- zinski. Time and again, in describing the events which THE FUTURE BELONGS TO FREEDOM By Eduard Shevardnadze Sinclair-Stevenson, 204 pages, Â£15 led to the various liberations in eastern Europe, the recogni- tion of a unified Germany, the breakthroughs on the arms front with the US, Mr Shevard- nadze writes in terms of grand principles and neglects the most basic of details. Instead, we have a surplus of two things: descriptions - though again, In very general terms - of Mr Shevardnadze's good relations with US secre- taries of state George Shultz and James Baker; and his thoughts about his internal struggles in getting his policy through the Communist party and the military. The latter, given a good narration, would have been fascinating: for it was clear well over a year before he resigned in December 1990, warning of looming dicta- torship, that he and his foreign ministry team were under great pressure from hardliners who resented the \"giving up\" of eastern Europe and the agreement to German unifica- tion. But instead of who did what to whom when, Mr Shev- ardnadze tells us that his feel- ings were hurt. One thing, perhaps unwit- tingly, he does make very clear: that he had, in taking up much of the ideological posi- tion of his former enemies, ren- dered himself terribly vulnera- ble to those back home who still spoke, or claimed to speak, in the name of communism. He really had crossed over the line, and in doing so, he threat- ened what had for decades been held to be Soviet strategic interests. Mr Shevardnadze simply represents his enemies as petty or blind: actually, they had a substantial point. New thinking in foreign policy meant, inevitably, a loss of power - for it meant that the Soviet Union no longer wished to be feared. It has been to the world's benefit that that was so, but one did not have to be either blind or stupid - only a communist - to miss it. Mr Shevardnadze, like Mr Gorbachev and others, ceased to be a communist long before he handed in his party card. He acted under the impulse of new beliefs - that the class struggle in foreign relations could be suicidal; that the Soviet Union constituted the main block on a deceleration of tension; that what he con- stantly calls \"human values\" could often co-exist with lib- eral capitalism, but not with state socialism. In doing so, he showed huge courage and dedi- cation and is now rightly held in high esteem - both in the west, and increasingly now in what was the Soviet Union. If only he had written a book tell- ing how he did it. John Lloyd",

   "text_content" : "By Samuel Brittan W''henever I point out the Sideeply-flawed nature of the V current balance of pay- ments as a measure of national sol- vency, I receive letters of a fury which far exceeds that of normal party political controversy. The fury is redoubled if I remark on the absur- dity of treating trade between Sussex and Normandy on an entirely differ- ent basis from trade between Sussex and more distant Yorkshire, for which there are noepayments figures. But at long last I have begun to appreciate the basic difference between those economists who take the idea of a balance of payments constraint for an advanced industrial country seriously and those who do not. The one element of common ground between thertwo schools is that every- one has eventually to live within his or her means. (In the jargon of con- temporary academics, he or she is subject to an inter-temporal budget constraint). It is, of course, quite proper to bor- row to build up capital assets or even to finance temporary increases in con- sumption. There is no magic formula for saying what the prudential limit is, despite the rules of thumb that bankers and accountants sometimes use. The only truly general rule is the banality that no-one's debt service to income ratio can carry on rising indefinitely. The economic liberal leaves it to individuals, companies and other bod- ies to make their own decisions and take their own risks - knowing that if they borrow imprudent amounts or on imprudent terms, they will suffer the fate of the companies that have been put in receivership in recent months. There can be excessive borrowing both by particular individuals and companies and at an aggregate level. Although borrowing and lending between domestic sectors cancels out, it is possible for all other sectors to borrow too much from the banks. All these types of excess are ultimately self-correcting. For a non-interventionist, the only significant difference between borrow- ing too much at home and borrowing too much abroad is that of currency risk. In a world of volatile and unpre- dictable exchange rates, it does make sense to be a degree more cautious in borrowing across the exchanges than in borrowing domestically. Thus sepa- rate currencies act as a tax on inter- national transactions. On the liberal approach, the govern- ment's main solvency task is to look after its own budget balance. Govern- ment has another duty, which is to safeguard the value of the currency in which economic agents do business with each other. Subject to this requirement, it may do its best to moderate the cycles of boom and bust; and there is a reasonable argument about whether these tasks are best accomplished at the national, Euro- pean or Group of Seven level. But on this liberal view it is not part of the government agenda to look after the solvency of individuals or companies. The interventionist does not think that this is enough. He believes that instead of being left to discover for themselves the limits of prudent bor- rowing, people should be protected from their own follies by a network of credit controls. The balance of pay- ments interventionist concentrates on borrowing across national frontiers. Suggestions that we should get rid of the pseudo-problem of the balance of payments by a European currency that covers the greater part of the external transaction of member states are greeted with special hostility, on the ground that this will merely transform the problem into a regional one. But if we use balance of payments estimates as a proxy for regional prob- lems, we will often go badly wrong. Some prosperous areas will be found to have current payments deficits and be wrongly diagnosed as problem cases. An example is a rapidly devel- oping country like Spain, whose pay- ments deficit is the mirror image of its success in attracting capital inflows from overseas. Genuine disas- ter areas on the other hand might well show surpluses. A possible case is Northern Ireland, as many of the transfers which it receives from Britain would count as current receipts. One reason why the current bal- ance of payments does not show whether a country is paying its way or a region is in difficulties is the familiar one of defective and pessimis- tic figures - for instance, the famous black hole in the world economy which is supposed to have a deficit of $100bn with itself. But far more important is the fallacy of concentrat- ing on the current account. For if the current balance has to be zero, all net Excessive overseas borrowing is self-correct- ing in the same manner as excessive domestic borrowing international borrowing or lending is ruled out. Nor is it possible to say whether borrowing across the exchanges is for capital or consumption by examining import composition. An inflow of con- sumer goods which sets free resources for domestic building and construc- tion finances investment just as much ~: Â·~:Â·:i i Â·Â· as imports of machine tools. A more subtle point is that overseas borrowing can be offset by an increase in the market value of over- seas assets. A very good example relates to the new British Pink Book balance of payments estimates. Net overseas assets are extremely volatile, as valuation is highly sensitive to security prices and exchange rates. On the official valuation they rose from Â£12bn at the end of 1979 to Â£103bn at the end of 1989. Because of the temporarily depressed level of Wall Street and the dollar, they had plunged to Â£30bn at the end of 1990. There is no later published informa- tion, but they are believed to have recovered to at least Â£50bn by the middle of 1991. They had thus risen over the period 1979-91 by about Â£30bn, or more than enough to offset the cumulative current deficit. The gain in value was due to capital appreciation. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the argument. For it so happens that for the purposes of compiling official estimates of overseas assets, the unre- corded receipts shown in the \"balanc- ing item\" are treated as current receipts - in strong contrast to their treatment in the balance of payments. The doomsters argue that for this rea- son the official estimates of overseas assets are too high. Fortunately there is an offsetting underestimate. Direct investments are undervalued because they are entered at book, rather than market values. A Cambridge economist, Clifford Prat- ten, has made a comprehensive The balance of payments does not measure whether UK residents are paying their way or borrowing too much attempt to revalue overseas direct investments on a market basis; and the accompanying table is an attempt to bring his estimates up to the end of 1990.* The effect of the revisions is to increase the initial valuation of over- seas assets at the end of 1979 and subsequent capital gains. Perhaps more valuable than these spot estimates is Pratten's assessment of the trend appreciation of overseas e g ears with the bad& puts trend real capital gains at 5.bn per annum. in addition both world and UK inflation are about 3 per cent, the nominal appreciation would be Â£6.2bn per annum. Enough has been said to show that I am not advocating an annual target balance of payments deficit of Â£6bn in place of the popular belief in a zero balance or surplus. The undervalua- tion of overseas direct investment is only one example of what can go astray in steering the economy by the payments compass. Let me therefore try to summarise what is wrong with the balance of payments approach. The current bal- ance of payments - highlighted by the monthly trade figures - does not measure, even approximately, whether UK residents are paying their way internationally or borrow- ing too much. No remotely likely sta- tistical improvement will change this, because the deficiencies are deep-seated and conceptual. Nevertheless, if by some miracle we could have some simple indicator of excessive overseas borrowing, it would still be a bad guide to policy. For it is companies and individuals who borrow too much or save too little; and they should be left to sort out the consequences of their own actions. Even if we want to be more pater- nalistic, regulation should be directed towards overall borrowing, irrespec- tive of whether it is domestic or exter- nal. The Liberal Democrats sense this with their espousal of a national savings target to be pursued through fiscal policy, even though that has a negligible chance of working. Those who are liberal with a small \"1\" will not, however, try to manipu- late borrowing and savings and would prefer the government to concentrate on its own budget and on stabilising the currency. If currency stabilisation involves high and prolonged unemployment one can sensibly ask if the currency is grossly overvalued, as it has been in some eastern European and Third World countries. But if comparative purchasing power for internationally traded products and core inflation rates are within spitting distance of main competitor countries - as they are in the UK at present - then a nominal devaluation is likely to stoke up inflation with no lasting benefit to jobs. Unemployment is then a labour market problem to be treated by try- ing to bring pay nearer to market clearing levels. Any resulting inequi- ties are best handled by social secu- rity reforms and ultimately by a more widespread distribution of personal property. It has taken several years to pre- pare the above few sentences; and interested readers might consider reading them several times in a moment of quiet. *Overseas Investments, Capital Gains and the Balance of Payments (Depart- ment of Applied Economics; Sidgwick Avenue.

   "text_content" : "From Dr R C Whelan. Sir, As a general election approaches, siren voices, sing- ing of increased research and development funding without mentioning any institutional changes to improve the exploi- tation of science and technol- ogy, grow louder. Clive Cook- son's article, \"A shift in balance\" (September 10), sug- gests that the FT has joined the chorus. Although the level of UK spending relative to other countries is important, the key question is how much has been done to ensure that R&D is linked effectively to the needs of UK-based companies, so as to speed its exploitation. Focusing national debate on scientific research expenditure in isolation is totally counter- productive, because it draws Ftom PA Leonard Mr Mann's letter (\"Corporate R&D rarely pays its way\", Sep- tember 4) claims that wise investors should avoid UK companies which spend heavily on R&D. He is altogether too sweep- ing in his blanket condemna- tion of R&D management in UK companies. For instance, one of the larg- est and most successful manu- facturing sectors in the coun- try is the chemical industry, with its unique positive bal- ance of payments of Â£2bn and its outstanding record of prod- uct imnovation. Over the last decade the UK chemical indus- try has grown faster than its attention away from the very basic question of how to use exploitable research to increase the value added in the UK economy. CEST's analyses of competi- tor nations such as Germany has highlighted the importance of intermediate institutions between the science base and industry in achieving this. In the UK we have yet to create the right mix. To increase the national R&D bud- get, without tackling these dif- ficult questions, would be a serious mistake and one which the political parties bidding for our votes should avoid.

While it is right to contrast (\"Up the junction\", September 6) the UK government's deci- sions on investment in the London Underground and the M25 motorway, it is a counsel of despair to suggest that wid- ening the M25 will bring little relief.

The M25 is a success story but it has been asked to do a job for which, as early as the 1930s, four rings around Lon- don were proposed. For indus- try, it is a vital artery.

   "text_content" : "By Ian Hamilton Fazey n awful realisation about the Channel tun- nel is dawning on much of northern England's business community: it is irrelevant for nearly everyone north of Bir- It is too difficult to reach and has only limited freight capac- ity. Britain's failure to develop a coherent transport policy and build the infrastructure to go with it will make the tunnel a largely regional asset for the south-east. The difficulty of negotiating a jammed-up London megalo- polis has already encouraged industry to vote with its wheels, as the growth of the four ports of the Humber estu- ary testifies. Last year they handled more than four times the level of freight planned for the tunnel; if only container freight is considered, they are already handling about the same amount as the tunnel is expected to start with. The scrapping of the National Dock Labour Scheme two years ago eliminated restrictive practices and enabled port owners to expand at sensible cost. Formerly uneconomic dock facilities have re-opened this summer. New wharves are being built in the River Humber to speed turnround times. As soon as new capacity comes on stream, it is filled. The view of the M62 motor- way from the Birch service sta- tion in Greater Manchester tells the story. Transcontinen- tal lorries trundle by in their hundreds in each direction. Many are from Ireland, using the Liverpool-Hull motorway as a land bridge to Rotterdam and beyond. Florists at Crosby on Mersey- side get fresh supplies via refrigerated juggernaut, straight from Dutch flower fields. The names and tele- phone numbers on the sides of other lorries suggest that the north of England is already part of the local market for companies in the Netherlands and northern Germany. This does not mean that the north has found a way of solv- ing its transport problems to continental Europe and can therefore be ignored as the government struggles to patch up London's infrastructural mess. The scale of national neglect means a perpetual scramble for priority funding; every pound spent on the M25 is a pound not available for roads somewhere else. Last week the north-west regional council of the Confed- eration of British Industry called for an integrated national transport policy, two new trans-Pennine motorways, even faster expansion of Man- chester airport and rail privati- sation to improve services. The region's manufacturers fear they will be cut off by bottle- necks developing even now, leaving them on the periphery of the single European market. This matters: north-west England accounts for 10 per cent of UK gross domestic product and can hardly be con- sidered an economic sideshow. In the developing Europe of trading regions, easier access to the markets of the Nether- lands, north Germany, Poland, Russia, Scandinavia and even the reborn Baltic states will mean less dependence on UK national markets and better- balanced regional development in the long term. Indeed, adding the regional GDP of Yorkshire and Humber- side, the east Midlands and the north-east to the north-west figure makes in all 29 per cent of the UK total. Scotland con- tributes another 8 per cent. Britain has always been too London-centred, and the infra- structure has reflected this. Yet in only half a generation the M62 has proved the value of east-west links to economic development and laid the basis for northern England to become a European super-re- gion. It makes sense to develop more trans-Pennine motor- ways, perhaps as toll roads, since this would put 37 per cent of the UK economy within a half-day's lorry drive of the north's most promising gate- way to Europe - the Humber estuary. That is far closer than the Channel tunnel will ever be, irrespective of the queues that will probably make it one of the great bottlenecks of the world.",

MR CLARK CLIFFORD, the 6-yearold Democratic power broker, was called a liar n Congess yesterday after claim- ing that be was unaware of the secret ownersp of the biggest bank in Washington by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BC0I). Mr Clifford served until last month as chairman of First American Bancshares, the Washington bank with $llbn (26.5bn) of assets whose secret control by a group of Arab front men acting for BCCI was revealed by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, shortly after BCCI was shut down last July 5. In a two-hour statement before a charged meeting of the banking committee of the US House of Representatives, Mr Clifford insisted that at no time had First American received instructions from BCCI regarding its business dedaions. Mr Clifford, whose career stretches from being an adviser to President Truman to secretary of defence, claimed that he had been deceived by BCCI and admitted that his Judgment had been \"question- able\". Mr Clifford also pointed the ainger at the Bank of England. \"I don't know that it's any comfort, but the Bank of England was deceived by BCCL \"Year after year, the Bank of England had the opportunity to act, but did not. Former Clford brushe aside his role.......................Page 8 prime minister Lord Calaghen was on the BCCI payroll for years and he was totaly non- plussed when the story broke. \"Year after year, Price Waterhouse signed BCCI accounts and said they were all true and correct.

Mr Chalmers Wylie, a Repub- lican from Ohio, said that the overwhelming weight of evi- dence in the report appeared to indicate that BCCI was more than a passive investor in First American. Mr Clifford gave undertak- ings to the Federal Reserve a decade ago that BCCI would have nothing to do with First American's operations. Mr Wylie said: \"This appears to have been a sophisticated scheme to deceive US bank regulators and I am at a loss to understand how Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were merely amiable dunces in this whole fiasco.\"",

The Revolutionary Justice Organisation said that 77-year- old Mr Mann, a retired airline pilot held since 1989, was in good health. The statement fol- lowed closely on the release yesterday by Israel of 51 Leb- anese prisoners, whose free- dom had been demanded by hostage takers. The Lebanese group holding Mr Mann welcomed Israel's action and said the move was part of a solution conducted in stages. It added that \"negotia- tions with the United Nations and the remaining mediators have reached a mechanism of a solution whereby Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid [an Islamic cleric held hostage in Israel] and all the detained brothers be released in stages.\" The key to moving the nego- tiating process forward has been the demands of the Leba- non-based groups for the release of nearly 400 Shias and Palestinians held by Israel, in particular Sheikh Obeid. Israeli officials have admitted that Sheikh Obeid is their trump card in their efforts to obtain the return of seven servicemen missing in Lebanon, or infor- mation about their fate. The moves came against the background of continuing dip- lomatic efforts by Mr Javier Pdrez de Cu6llar, the UN sec- retary-general, who yesterday held talks in Tehran with Ira- nian president All Akbar Hash- emi Rafsanjani. In Washington, following Israel's release of the Leban- ese, the White House expressed cautious optimism about a res- olution of the hostage issue, describing the Israeli action as \"positive\". However, the US position remains that it wants all western hostages, including five Americans, freed so the prospective release of one or more will not be treated as an extraordinary event. last month the freeing of Briton Mr John McCarthy by Islamic Jihad suggested that Iran was keen to end the plight of the hostages.

   "text_content" : "By Ian Davidson and Ivo Dawnay in Paris MARKED differences in approach between France and Britain over the future devel- opment of Europe emerged again last night after a bilat- eral meeting in Paris between Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and Mr John Major. While UK officials character- ised the talks as \"warm and friendly\", it was clear from an earlier press conference by the French president that the two leaders hold divergent views over the timing and objectives of negotiations on economic and political union within the European Community. Mr Mitterrand indicated that his government was deter- mined to see a definitive con- clusion to the EC treaties by the end of the year. He rejected suggestions that they might lead to a two-speed Europe in which integration would be faster for some countries. At the press conference prior to his meeting with Britain's prime minister, Mr Mitterrand also said he had doubts over the feasibility of a rapid inte- gration of east European coun- tries into the EC. Mr Major appears genuinely tempted by the tactical flexibility inherent in the idea of a two-speed EC, at least in part to maintain unity within his Conservative party in the uncertain run-up to a general election.

Last Friday, EC negotiations on farm imports from east Europe were stalled when France blocked more Polish beef imports. However, Presi- dent Mitterrand yesterday dis- claimed any opposition in prin- ciple to such imports. There also appeared to be a discrepancy in tone between the two leaders over nuclear safeguards.

   "text_content" : "Shareholders in British Aerospace have reason to be disgruntled. A rights issue duly arrived yesterday. What was not foreseen was an interim performance awful enough to suggest BAe's lon- ger-term troubles may have been seriously under-esti- mated. The recession aside, the group has not been making enough profits from property sales to cover a sharp increase in the costs of its reorganisa- tion. That the technique of throw- ing cash at its problems has failed to stop the rot was sym- bolised by the half-year swing into a Â£45m loss at Rover. Pre- tax group profits this year will be half the Â£300m expected by outsiders a week ago. After deducting dividends and advance corporation tax, apply- ing the net Â£235m of excep- tional items announced yester- day and the cash element of the write-off on Rover's US foray, the declared loss for the year will be in the order of Â£250m. If that looks bad enough, consider the fate of the rights issue proceeds. Admittedly, the money will allow the group some breathing space from the unexpectedly nasty effects of the recession. The amount is large enough to dilute earn- ings, but not to do away with the need for much more money a few years from now. In capital intensive businesses like aerospace and vehicle manufacturing, Â£432m does not go far - BAe is spending Â£300m cash this year alone on redundancies; another Â£135m will flow out as dividends and ACT. On a longer view, the epi- sode raises the question of how far the City is prepared to fund a group like BAe. The issue of prepayments on defence con- tracts has not been addressed, but it is plausible that the eventual lower cost base will result in benefits to the tune of several hundred mil- lion pounds. Whether the worldwide defence business will allow BAe to enjoy any such benefits is another mat- ter. Shareholders must take a view on whether and when Rover and the property busi- ness can pull the group out of trouble. On the previous occa- sion BAe made a net annual loss, the dividend was increased by 8 per cent. Since 1985, BAe has increased its div- idend by an average 11 per cent as compensation for a vol- atile earnings stream. This year, the payout will be main- tained on the increased share capital, offering a yield of 8 per FT-SE Index: 2,626.8 (4.2) Prudential Share price relative to the FT-A Al-Share Index 105 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 1986 87 88 89 90 91 Soumr: Dltrnam cent; the year after, it is likely to be maintained again. Those investors who decide recovery is probable will have to be patient. CHB The best bits in a pathfinder prospectus are always rubbed out. But yesterday's document from CHB at least confirms that the latest housebuilder to (re)join the market has an enviably cheap land bank and an impressive recent financial record relative to its peers. The question is obviously the price. This will doubtless be the subject of more than usually intense negotiation, with Bea- zer desperate to extract every penny on the one hand and the management of the freed com- pany anxious to not to over- play expectations on the other. Given that Mr Brian Beazer is very much a forced seller it will be no surprise if there is something for the stags. Prudential Critics of Mr Mick New- march allege that he was given his reward for knocking things into shape at the Pru before he had earned it. Admirers may cite yesterday's higher than expected 41 per cent jump in pre-tax profits as a first justifi- cation of the chief executive's famous salary increase. That would probably be a charitable view of the results. There are bright spots, to be sure; notably the surge in prof- its from the Jackson National US life and pensions business which appears to be coming good after several years of rapid growth, and looks set to limit its once notorious junk bond exposure to just 10 per cent by the end of the year. Much of the improvement above the line, though, stems from comparisons with a half year blighted by Â£24m of losses from the ill-fated estate agency venture. The earnings advance is restricted to just 17 per cent after a bigger tax charge. No doubt through good luck as well as good judgment, the company has been spared the sort of spectacular underwrit- ing losses run up elsewhere through mortgage guarantee and household subsidence. The decision to hang on to the MandG reinsurance busi- ness may be the right one at this stage in the cycle. A sale, on the other hand, would pro- vide strength for the balance sheet and remove a source of volatile earnings. It may yet happen one day, along with a further rationalisation of the non-life side of the business. At 252p, the shares are sitting on a near 6 per cent prospective yield which suggests that investors still have to be con- vinced. Cadbury Schweppes Sir Graham Day's reputation as a fixer of businesses may be coming a trifle unstuck at Rover; as chairman of Cadbury he can stroll confidently into work. Judging by yesterday's impressive interim results, Cadbury does not need much fixing. Rather, it has proved its resilience in hard times, increasing market share across its product range and pushing up the group trading margin despite difficulties in raising prices. As the turnaround of Trebor Basset shows, the extraction of value from its brands still comes easily. There is no rea- son to doubt the group's ability to continue its steady growth, although the brands will be devouring ever more cash for marketing. Cadbury shares have long enjoyed a premium rating; picking the right moment to buy them is as diffi- cult for investors as doubtless it is for that patient predator. But a quiet Christmas could provide a rare opportunity. Indices This week's fall in the share price of British Aerospace has hit the Professor Roland Smith index of UK companies. The index, which is unweighted, is based on the average perfor- mance against the market of the share prices of the seven public companies listed in the 1991 edition of Who's Who which he still chairs. It assumes an equal investment in each company at the end of the year in which he took over. Last night's close was minus 4.5 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "FUTURE PERFECT For those who depend on income from investments, bank and building society deposits are less than ideal. Not only do interest rates fluctuate, they offer no protection against the erosion of capital by inflation. Dividends from shares, on the other hand, can provide a rising income with protection of real capital value. But it is not easy to identify the companies which are going to increase their profits and dividends over time. With 120 fund managers and more than Â£35 billion under management, Mercury is well qualified to perform this complex task. Mercury seeks out companies which are industry leaders,with sound balance sheets and strong positive cash flow. Factors which determine a company's capacity to sustain rising dividends as well as growth in business. Mercury's resources for researching large numbers of companies in detail are exceptional. This depth of resource is one of the factors that has led to Mercury being chosen to manage pension fund investments for over 500 companies and public bodies. The record of Mercury Income Fund demonstrates Mercury's ability to deliver growing income. By 1st September 1991, investors at the launch in 1984 had seen both their annual income and the value of their investment* more than double.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer with a substantial book of general insur- ance business, yesterday posted a 41 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Â£170m. The results buck the recent trend which has seen a string of poor results by insurers. The group increased its interim divi- dend by 9 per cent to 3.8p. Although the increase was ahead of expectations the market remained cautious with shares finishing unchanged at 252p. Profits in the group's core life insurance operations increased by 9 per cent to Â£190.2m. But most of the improvement was due to the elimination of estate agency losses in the UK - following the sale of the group's network of agencies since last November - and a reduction in losses to Â£54.2m, from Â£71.3m, from UK general insurance busi- ness. The estate agents lost Â£23.7m at the halfway stage last year, while the Pru's low exposure to domestic building and mortgage guarantee business meant it avoided the heavy claims that bedevilled the results of many of its competitors. The profitability of the life business reflected strong growth of single premium pensions, endowments and annuities busi- ness in the UK and a good perfor- mance by Pru's US Jackson National subsidiary. In the UK life business gener- ated profits of Â£135m, against Â£126m last time. New single pre- mium business grew strongly. The Prudence Bond - a single- premium unitised with-profits savings policy launched in April and designed to strengthen the Pru's market position in the inde- pendent financial advisers mar- ket - proved particularly suc- cessful, with about Â£38m in revenues. In the US profits at Jackson National nearly tripled to Â£29.5m. Jackson's exposure to junk bonds, a cause for concern last year, has been reduced (junk now accounts for about 11 per cent of total investments compared with about 20 per cent a year ago). The Pru also said it would not sell its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile & General Re, the UK's biggest. The group has opted to develop its reinsurance business, follow- ing a reassessment of the strength of M & G's life fund. M & G made profits of Â£24.5m, against Â£17.8m last time, from its life reinsurance activities in the first six months of this year but these \"reported figures do not reflect the underlying value of the business,\" said Mr Mick New- march, chief executive.

   "text_content" : "Last Monday, brokers for British Aerospace began visiting the company's largest institutional shareholders to tell them the bad news person- ally; not only would half-year profits be wildly below expecta- tion but BAe would be asking shareholders to cough up another Â£432m to see it through hard times. \"We were quite shocked\" said the investment chief at one Scot- tish-based investment fund. BAe, he said, had not visited their largest shareholders in months. When last heard from, forecasts were upbeat. Yesterday, the company announced terms of a two-for-five rights offering which will expand BAe's capital base by roughly a third. New shares, priced at 380p, were to be offered at an unusu- ally hefty 25 per cent discount to their opening price yesterday of 508p. Large institutional sharehold- ers have described the rights offering as among the most clumsy in recent memory, from the first leaked press reports that it was imminent to the last min- ute cancellation of a meeting in London yesterday with share- holders to explain the interim results. Meetings were cancelled, share- holders were told, because the company's investment bank, Kleinwort Benson, believed the imminent share offering required it to remain silent under terms of the Financial Services Act. That only added to institu- tional unease. After all, one shareholder noted, Ladbroke was able to talk to investors when it presented them with an identical situation two weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange said it has \"noticed\" the spate of leaks surrounding not only the BAe rights offering, but the offerings of P&O and Lad- broke earlier this summer. The exchange, which will not comment on individual company affairs, said it is looking into the matter generally. Meanwhile, stockbrokers to the issue, Hoare Govett and Klein- wort Benson, were able to distrib- ute sub-underwriting positions to institutions within hours. Institutions who say they are uncertain about whether they will exercise their rights to buy shares say the yield and the dis- count - and the underwriting income - were enough to per- suade them to do that. \"If we can't sell the shares, we will put them in our recovering compa- nies fund,\" said one fund man- ager. Reaction to the earnings and the rights offering can best be summed up in the share price. Shares fell 63p yesterday to close at 445p, nar- rowing the discount considera- bly. \"At these levels, 380p looks like just the right discount,\" said one shareholder. Institutions, many of which have agreed to act as sub-under- writers for a 1% per cent fee, are uniformly reluctant to talk pub- licly about the offering. However, most have formed the view that BAe, and/or its bro- i kers, allowed word of the offering t to seep into the market to drive I the share price down to the level where the discount would look acceptable. Before the first news leak, BAe's share price was 550p. ; After all, shareholders could well feel that the company is undercharging for new shares. BAe has scheduled a series of t meetings with institutional shareholders between now and October 7 when shareholders will be asked to approve the offering at an extraordinary general meet- *ing. What shareholders say they i really need to know before they decide whether to exercise their i pre-emptive rights is exactly how the company will deploy the new capital. \"The brokers are telling us ' that BAe transacts a lot of for- ward foreign exchange business I which requires letters of credit from banks\", comments one insti- tutional fund manager. The banks, he says, have been unwilling to extend the required letters of credit because the capi- i tal base is shrinking, thus requir- \\ ing the company to seek more i capital from shareholders. I The shrinking capital base reflects, among other things, the winding down of advances from i Saudi Arabia and the cost of a I significant restructuring in key businesses. k However, he said he was trou- - bled by the difficulties the com- * pany had run into in its Rover division, not long after deciding that the business needed to be I geared up and 24-hour workshifts * installed. rg ve rel ok iws 1. [Id is of Lal nd ill rig et- ey ey Air bw us )r- as lit Iti. en ed pi- ir- ire Sir Roland Smith, BAe chairman, trying to expand the capital se base by one third 1Â·5 Another major institutional shareholder said he remains con- cerned about BAe's long-term strategy. \"There's been a lot of concern that interest [at BAe] is in the nimble deal rather than the deal for long-term strategy,\" he said. Whether BAe simply bought Rover because it was cheap and available was a question that needed to be answered. Also, he said, he was surprised at the extent of the sudden rationalisa- tion in key businesses. \"Could it have been done year-by-year?\" he asked. The fact that such a sudden restructuring was announced could suggest BAe had not been in control of costs previously. First-half results, Page 24"

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent BEAZER, the highly-borrowed construction and building materi- als group, yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus for the planned float - largely through a placing to UK institutions - of CHB, its UK housebuilding, con- tracting and property group. Lazard Bros, merchant bank, which is organising the flotation, said it would be one of the largest UK share sales. The pathfinder prospectus pro- vided details of the issue, but not the offer price. It included a breakdown of CHB's profits per- formance since 1987. It showed that pre-tax profits fell only 15 per cent, to Â£6I4m during the year to the end of June from Â£75.5m, in spite of one of the worst UK housing markets for half a century. Beaser has debts of more than Â£lbn. Mr Nicholas Jones, a managing director of Lazard, said yesterday that about 65 per cent of CHB's shares were expected to be placed with UK institutions. There were clawback provi- sions, however, which would allow members of the public to buy shares. The price of the shares and the size of the clawback would be announced on September 27 when the issue is due to be offi- cially launched. Applications must be submitted by 10am on Tuesday, October 8. The bank expects that about 10 per cent of the CHB shares would be acquired by existing Beazer shareholders in the UK, 15 per cent by other members of the public and CHB employees, and 10 per cent by US institutions, most of which would already own Beaer shares. Housing accounted for more than 95 per cent of CHB's operat- in profits of Â£524m and more than three quarters of its pre-tax profits. Mr Terry Upsal, CHB's cdier executive, said the company sold 5,006 houses last year making it Britain's fourth largest house- builder. The company's success In restricting the fall in its profits had been based on its housing land bank of more than 15,000 plots with planning permission, much acquired before 1988 at an average price of Â£12000 a plot. The group's national and inter- national construction companies were less profitable but strong generators of cash: This meant that CHB had no gearing and had cash balances of nearly Â£50m last month, he said. Mr Amarjit Chhina, building analyst with stockbrokers Barc- lay de Zoete Wedd, said an entry p/e of between 10 and 12 on his- toric profits after tax of 44.am would suggest an isue of iSOp to 175p which rauld nise 4i0Om to e52Sm.

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harverson in New York A PACKED Congressional hearing heard yesterday that a \"distressingly large number\" of Wall Street dealer firms had vio- lated government rules when buying US agency securities. Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets watchdog, told the Senate Securi- ties Subcommittee that the viola- tions were uncovered in the course of the SEC's investigation into the 39 primary dealers in government securities. He did not disclose how many firms had submitted false state- ments, but said: \"I am nowhere near where we can say we know the full scope of the problem.\" Although Mr Breeden would not say what form of securities were involved, it is believed that firms have filed false reports when buying securities of the Federal National Mortgage Asso- ciation, the government-backed residential mortgage agency. The Senate hearing into the Salomon affair was also told yes- terday that the US Treasury would make sweeping changes to the way it sells government secu- rities. Under the changes, insti- tutions which bid for large amounts of securities through primary dealers will have to pro- vide written verification of their orders to the government. This should ensure customer orders are authentic, and was prompted by Salomon admitting that it submitted unauthorised cus- tomer bids before several recent auctions. Another change, to take place immediately, will prevent the panel of primary dealers, which regularly advises the Treasury, having early access to informa- tion about the government's quarterly borrowing needs. In the past, the panel has been told before the rest of the market, an arrangement heavily criticised by Congressmen. Data on Trea- sury borrowing requirements will now be publicly released before the panel meets. The Treasury will also auto- mate the auction process, with the first stage completed next year. It has set up a body to improve the sharing of market surveillance information among government regulators. The Treasury may adopt a new method of pricing government securities. Mr Jerome Powell, assistant Treasury secretary, said a move to a \"dutch auction\" system - where all bidders whose tenders are accepted pay the same price based on the aver- age bid - was being considered.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peeton and Roland Rudd LONRHO, the international trading group, last night told Brent Walker formally for the first time that it was consider- ing making a takeover offer for the troubled leisure group. Lonrho's move followed a decision made yesterday morn- ing by Brent Walker's steering committee of banks to set a timetable of two days to reach agreement with the company's dissident bondholders on a plan to prevent Brent Walker from going into receivership. Yesterday the company's big banks said that this was a deadline. \"If I were a betting man, I would reckon the restructuring won't go through,\" commented one banker. However, Standard Char- tered, leader of the steering committee, put out a statement late yesterday that \"any sug- gestion that a deadline has been imposed is totally incor- rect\". A member of the steering committee explained Stan- dard's statement as meaning that an agreement with the bondholders did not have to be signed and sealed within two days. However, there had to be some prospect of a solution by then and \"at the moment there is none\", he said. The dissident bondholders, led by Mr Michael Smurfit and Jefferson Smurfit, his packag- ing company, would back a takeover offer for Brent Walker by Lonrho, which is also a bondholder. Lonrho said it did not believe the banks' time table worsened its chances of acquiring the company. Mr Paul Spicer, a director at Lonrho, said: \"If the banks have given the bondholders a deadline, it will be the second in 72 hours.\" Although a takeover offer from Lonrho has been rumoured for weeks, it commu- nicated its possible terms to Brent Walker's directors for the first time yesterday. It has made a tentative offer to swap $900m (about Â£532m) of Brent Walker's debt for convertible preference shares. However, these terms are subject to an evaluation of Brent Walker's assets in a due diligence review. In a confidential letter to Brent Walker's board, com- piled and delivered by Hambros Bank at 6pm yester- day, Lonrho confirmed its intention to provide \"short- term working capital\" of up to Â£20m while it evaluates Brent Walker's assets, subject to the condition that any money it invests in Brent Walker in this period will have first claim over Brent Walker's assets. By giving a written under- taking that it would provide a bridging loan to Brent Walker during the due diligence pro- cess, Lonrho hopes to allay banks' fears. The banks have no guarantee that Lonrho will eventually make a satisfactory takeover offer. During Lon- rho's examination of the assets, their exposure to Brent Walker could have increased.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller AN IMPROVEMENT in trading margins in UK sweets and across the board in drinks helped Cadbury Schweppes increase pre-tax profit by 6.5 per cent to Â£111.5m in the half year to June 15. The growth, from Â£104.7m, came on flat sales of Â£1.42bn (Â£1.41bn). The advance in earn- ings per share was limited to 3.6 per cent by a Â£4.5m prefer- ence dividend payment related to the Â£125m acquisition of Source Perrier's soft drinks division last year. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said volumes were flat. \"We sold about 200,000 tonnes of confectionery and nearly 3bn litres of beverages.\" The group's profits were weighted towards the second half because of Christmas. He put down rumours that Cadbury was a potential bid target, perhaps for Philip Mor- ris of the US, as \"the need to churn stock\". UK beverages were 9 per cent down by volume, partly because of the cool weather and partly because of the econ- omy. The recession had reduced eating out and the associated drink sales. On. the other hand, Easter confectionery was 16 per cent up. Trebor Bassett sweets, acquired two years ago and criticised as a lower margin business, lifted trading mar- gins from 6.1 to 9.6 per cent. While currency movements cut nearly Â£6m from trading profit, acquisitions added Â£8.6m, with the French buy the most significant. Overall, trad- ing profit advanced to Â£134.8m (E129.3m). Confectionery sales grew to Â£613.3m (E600.8m), while profit slipped to Â£68.7m (Â£70.3m) with the UK and Australia falling back. Beverages increased profit to Â£66.1m (Â£59m) on sales of Â£806.9m (Â£811.5m). The best improvements came in the Americas, Australia and the Pacific rim, and Africa. Mr Cadbury stressed the role of reduced costs in improving profits. Prices had only risen by between 2 and 3 per cent. An internal reorganisation that had moved the beverage headquarters from the US to the UK showed that \"the bever- age market is more important to us in Europe.\" Mr David Jinks, finance director, said net debt rose from Â£466m to to Â£516m after acquisitions, giving gearing of 65 per cent It was expected to fall to 50 per cent by the end of the year. Interest costs declined to Â£24.5m (Â£25.6m). Marketing expenditure was increased to Â£168m (Â£163m) and capital spending to Â£102m (94m). Earnings per share were 10.16p (9.81p) and the interim dividend goes up to 3.2p (3p). See Lex"

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger CAPARO GROUP, the private holding company controlled by Mr SwraJ Paul and his falily, yesterday made an offer for the outstanding shares in Cap- aro Industries, its 79.4 per cent-owned subsidiary. The offer of 64p per share values Caparo Industries at Â£59.4m. Yesterday its shares jumped 14%p to close at 62p. If the bid is successful, Cap- aro Group would become a diversified engineering group with turnover of some Â£400m, an increase of 60 to 70 per cent. Mr Swraj, involved in the UK engineering sector since the 1970s, said he had made the offer because institutional investors were not interested in companies which were so closely held. He and his family were reluctant to reduce their stake. \"It will be easier to run it as an entrepreneurial company,\" Mr Swraj added. If the offer was not accepted, he was con- tent to maintain his holding. However, he said, if Caparo Industries remained a public company, expansion would be limited. Caparo Industries yesterday announced a 41 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Â£5.29m (Â£8.98m) for the six months to June 30. This included a Â£468,000 gain on the revalua- tion of Richardsons West- garth, the steel stockholding and processing group. Caparo has recently shed its 8.7 per cent stake in Richardsons. Mr Swraj said he was proud of the results when he compared them to other companies in the same sector. The decline was sharpest in the UK where the weak con- struction market hit sales. Turnover was down to Â£115.2m (Â£123.9m). Margins in a highly competitive continen- tal European market were squeezed, as the group strug- gled to maintain its share. Mr Swraj warned that the outlook for the year was likely to be disappointing. As a result, the interim dividend is reduced to Ip (1.5p). Earnings per share fell by 40 per cent to 3.22p. If fully diluted, earnings would be 3.17p (5.05p).",

   "text_content" : "BRITISH AEROSPACE said yesterday that in future it would only consider develop- ing completely new commer- cial aircraft models in partner- ship with other substantial risk sharing partners. It also indicated that it intends to reorganise its regional aircraft business in partnership with other interna- tional manufacturers. These decisions mark the end of an era in UK aircraft manufacturing, bringing it in line with the international industry trend of collaborative programmes. Although BAe is a 20 per cent shareholder in the Euro- pean Airbus aircraft manufac- turing consortium, the com- pany has continued to produce its own family of regional air- liners in the 19 to 120 seat range. But Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said the regional air- craft business did not generate a sufficient return on capital in its present form. Hit by the financial problems of smaller airlines and the recession, the business was responsible for sending BAe's commercial air- craft operations back into the red. These showed a Â£16m trad- ing loss in the first half of this year, compared with a Â£15m profit in the correspond- Defence still prominent profit centre Defence remained the dominant profit centre for British Aerospace in the first half of this year. In spite of slightly lower sales of Â£1.92bn compared with Â£2.06bn last time, trading profits increased by Â£96m to Â£273m. This improvement reflected the increased maturity of some defence contracts. But the company also warned that the the defence business, tradi- tionally the source of more than 80 per cent of its profits, was under pressure because of defence cuts. This has forced the company to seek new business opportu- nities in civil sectors. However, the company remains one of the world's largest defence contractors and intends to consolidate its position in this sector. BAe sees strengths for the company in the Middle East and the Far East. The second phase of the Al Yamamah defence contract was expected to support continuing sales through the rest of the decade of about Â£2bn a year. Overall, BAe expects the world defence market to decline by 10 per cent by 1995, recovering marginally by the year 2000.

Although sales rose from Â£635m to Â£839m, new order activity fell during the first half because of recession in the US and UK and the general fall in air travel. Mr Evans said profits from Airbus in the first half had been wiped out by the regional aircraft losses. Business jet operations also remained profitable, but were likely to be involved in any rationalisation of the regional aircraft business. BAe is holding discussions with other manufacturers in an attempt to reorganise the regional aircraft industry which could lead to the cre- ation of a new international aircraft grouping. BAe is, however, pinning its long-term hopes on the Airbus programme, which in recent months, has been increasingly seen as an important source of growth to offset the decline in the defence business. Mr Evans emphasised BAe's intention to play a full part in the development of the Euro- pean aircraft consortium. \"Air- bus is a real key area for this company,\" he said. BAe, which produces the wings for Airbus airliners, expects the business to gener- ate a significant return in comr ing years. But its growth will also require more working capital to support the sharp increase in production. This was one reason why BAe was seeking fresh capital through its Â£432m rights issue.",

   "text_content" : "ROVER GROUP, the motor vehicle arm of British Aerospace, showed a Â£45m trading loss in the first half of this year compared with a E33m profit in the same period of 1990. The loss reflected the depressed state of the UK car market which has suffered a far more severe slump than expected. BAe yesterday also warned that it saw no signs of any early recovery in the car market which is expected to remain depressed this year. Motor vehicle sales in the first half were flat at Â£1.86bn. The company also said the decision last month to withdraw the Rover Sterling car from the US market would cost Â£45m. This would be charged as an extraordinary item in the second half. Although Rover increased market share in the UK, reaching 14.44 per cent in the first eight months of this year against 13.98 per cent for the same period last year, and exports have advanced, production volumes this year have been reduced in response to a 20 per cent fall in the UK new car market. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said the strategy was to increase Rover's penetration of the European market to reduce its depen- dence on the domestic UK market. Unlike its main European competitors, Rover is more dependent at present on its domestic market. Rover will continue to require substantial investment involving capital expenditure of more than Â£200m a year for the next three years and annual revenue expenditure of Â£150m. But BAe said despite this heavy requirement, Rover is expected to continue in overall terms to be self-financing over this period. Mr Evans also stressed that the company's 12 year association with Honda of Japan remained a \"major factor\" in the revitalisation of the Rover Group.",

Expenditure on professional fees was Â£889,000 plus Â£422,000 spent on defending the take- over bid. Exceptional costs of 2.19m (Â£1.25m) related mainly to provisions for stock and excess properties. The new directors also critic- ised the three acquisitions made during 1990 - ETCL, VISIsystems and the former BOC training services busi- ness. In particular the provi- sion for excess properties was caused by ETCL, which is no longer trading. Measures taken under the new stewardship include changes in the group's over- head structure, decentralisa- tion of management and signif- icant redundancies. It is proposed to change group's name to Touchstone Investment Group.

   "text_content" : "y Michiyo Nikunoto COSTAIN GROUP, the UK construction, mining and engs- neering concern, warned that significant provisions against land values could become nec :esary at the year-end, as it unveiled a 72 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits. It maintained its interim div- idend at 4.75p. Costain's profits in the six months to June 30 plunged from Â£20.lm to Â£5.7m as the group struggled to contain losses in its commercial and residential property activities. The group suggested that its dividend could be cut at the year-end when it expects pro- its before land writedown to be below 1990's 80.5m. The shares suffered a 13 per cent decline to 112p. Mr Peter Sawdy, chairman, said that many of the group's business areas saw no s of an upturn and that conditions had actually worsened in the building, housing and property markets. The group had concentrated its efforts on restructuring and rationalising and some coal mines in the US had been closed. The engineering and construction business has been restructured and between 500 and 800 employees made redun- dant throughout the group. Although it has received Â£77m from the April rights issue, interest charges were still high at Â£14.9m (19.2m). Group net debt was U00m. The engineering and con- struction division suffered a 19 per cent setback to Â£11.9m (Â£14.7m). However, it managed to increase the order book to Eo98m (s96om) at the year-end. Mining profits were also down by 19 per cent to Â£5.4m (Â£18.9m). Although its two main mines in Australia improved results, a weakening of coal prices affected profits from its US mines. The commercial and reiden- tial property division saw a los of 26.7m (25.7m profit). The group has curtailed virtu- ally all its property velop ment and the UK useud programme has been reded substantally. Overall turnover dedlined to Â£651.2m (S72m). Restated earn- ings per share, were Ip (7.4p). * COMNT The growing concern about Costain is whether or not it will be able to maintain its div- idend. The City consensus seems to be that it will be very difficult to sustain its present dividend level and the gpop itself hinted as much in it* statement. There is little in the group's own view of its outlook to suggest a recovery and given the land writeoowns loming ahead fouraits rang1P from no proflt to a i5t bosss for the full year. The question then becomes how severe the dividend cut will be and agein estimates range from a drop to 7p against 7.7 n 180 to, at tre extreme nd, no dividend payment at all Those who do not find Costain attractive on the basis of its dividend now, are not going to do so six months from now.

   "text_content" : "ERITH, the Hertfordshire- based builders' merchant, sus- fered a sharp decline in taxable profits during the first half of 1991, \"one of the harshest\" trading climates experienced by the company. On turnover down by 18 per cent to Â£34.1m (Â£41.5m) pre-tax profits dropped from Â£1.42m to Â£356,000. Earnings worked through at 0.55p (2.16p) per share, but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.3p. Mr Graham Davies, chair- man, said a wages freeze had been imposed, coupled with strict control of all operating costs and capital investment. The company had been hit by an unprecedented high level of bad debts caused by business failures and bankruptcies of customers. 11% gain at IFG despite tough market Profits before tax of IFG Group, a USM-quoted supplier of financial services, increased by some 11 per cent from Â£742,000 to Â£820,000 in the six months to end-June. Turnover advanced from Â£1.67m to Â£2.23m. Earnings per share came out at 2.25p (2.24p) and directors intend to recom- mend payment of a dividend at the year-end. Mr Joe Moran, chairman, said the results had been achieved in spite of very diffi- cult market conditions, partic- ularly in the UK. Abbeycrest falls to just over break-even Pre-tax profits of Abbeycrest, a designer and manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery, fell from Â£1.53m to Â£32,000 in the first half of 1991. A combination of \"aggres- sive de-stocking by the major jewellery retailers and sluggish retail sales\" reduced opportuni- ties to supply by as much as 35 per cent over the correspond- ing period. The near break-even position was struck on reduced turn- over of Â£16.1m (Â£21.5m), though this pointed to a further growth in market share, Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said. He added that the view that some recovery in consumer spending was likely by Christ- mas appeared to be gaining ground. Earnings dived to 0.lp (4.2p) per share, but the interim divi- dend is held at 1.2p. Recovery checked at Celestion Industries The recovery at Celestion Industries, the clothing, swim- wear and audio group, suffered a setback in the six months to end-June as the company slipped back into loss. On a 15 per cent reduction in sales, from Â£19.9m to Â£16.8m, trading losses of Â£447,000 (Â£458,000 profit) were incurred. And after a higher interest charge of Â£324,000 (Â£310,000) the pre-tax deficit came out at Â£771,000 (Â£148,000 profit). Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said that although the results for the first half were disappointing, directors believed that the group would achieve a reasonable recovery in the second half. Losses per share were 3.2p (0.7p earnings). J Hewitt (Fenton) tumbles to Â£219,000 Taxable profits of J Hewitt & Son (Fenton), the Staffordshire- based refractory group, tum- bled from Â£415,000 to Â£219,000 for the half year to end-June. Turnover dipped from Â£4.44m to Â£358m. Mr Christopher Nurse, chair- man and chief executive, said that costs would continue to be reduced. The operating profit margin edged ahead from 81 per cent I to 8.2 per cent. Further invest- I ment in plant and machinery was reflected in interest charges of Â£81,000 (Â£102,000) - higher than might otherwise have been expected\", he main- tained. The interim dividend is held i at p, payable from earnings reduced from 7.9p to 3.8p per share.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Scaffolding Fall behind Mowlem's Plunge to Â£7m",
   "text_content" : "Sir Philip Beck steps taken to reduce overheads By Peggy Hollinger A SHARP decline in the UK scaffolding business sent pre tax profits plunging by 61 per cent at John Mowlem, the con- struction and London City Air port group, from Â£18m to Â£7m for the six months to June 30. Sir Philip Beck, chairman, said the division had suffered a 30 per cent drop in volume in the UK and steps had been taken to cut overheads. Some 920 jobs had gone, largely in this division, resulting in costs of about Â£2.6m for the year. Sales fell 9 per cent to Â£697m (Â£764m). Earnings per share dropped from 12.9p to 4.7p. The interim dividend is slightly higher, following the rights issue in April, at 5.65p (5.54p), leaving it without cover. Sir Philip refused to comment on whether the group would cut its final dividend. The order book, at Â£865m, was lower than last year, but still healthy, he said. Losses from associated com- panies rose to Â£4.1m (Â£1.4m). About Â£3.1m of this came from Maple Oak, a property venture. The contracting division experienced its best ever first half, Sir Philip said. The cycli- cal nature of the business, meant that it tended to do bet- ter during a downturn, when costs were lower. Housing and property con- tinued to be difficult, however. Some 290 houses were reserved in the period, with sales in the last three to four months ahead of last year. The average price, however, had fallen from about Â£84,500 to Â£73,200. Mowlem is counting on win- ning government approval to extend London City Airport, of which it owns 90 per cent, to boost long-term prospects. The group said it was confident a decision would soon be made. * COMMIT The biggest uneasiness yester- day appeared to be Mowlem's to fall in with competi- tors' talk of final dividend cuts. If last year's total dividend of 21p is maintained, then Mow- lem would have to make prof- its of Â£33.5m to cover the pay- out. Some analysts were sug- gesting that a more comfort- able dividend would be lip. At this level, it would still only be barely covered at the top end of forecasts. These range from Â£13m to Â£17m for the year, making a prospective p/e of between 20 to 25 times earn- ings. Next year's profits are forecast to run somewhat bet- ter at Â£20m. The shares are fully priced for a recovery and a historic yield of 12 per cent reflects doubts about the total dividend being maintained.",

   "text_content" : "By RoeMl Rudd INVERGORDON Distillers Group, the Scotch whisky pro ducer fighting a Â£286m take- over bid from Whyte & Mackay, yesterday forecast an increase in taxable profits of at leat 41 per cent for the full year to December 31. The total dividend is forecast to be 6.5p, a rise of 30 per cent. Dr Chris Greig, managing director, said the \"sparkling forecast\" further underlined the reasons why the board was determined to fight for the company's independence.\"We have a reputation for achieving our promises,\" he added. The shares fell 3p to close at 266p, still well ahead of the 225p per share offer made by W&M, the drinks subsidiary of American Brands, the US tobacco group. Invergordon also announced a 60 per cent incriase in tax- able profits to Â£1.1lm (28.2m) for the six months to June 30, achieved on static sales, exclu- ding duty, of Â£39.6m. Earnings per share increased to 6.8p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p (2p). Mr Michael Lunn, chairman and chief executive of W&M, said the results and forecast did nothing to change his view that the cash offer of 225p per share was generous. \"We are given no informna tion as to the source of the additional profits which Inver-- gordon is suddenly going to, produce,\" he said. \"How will Invergordon sustain these prof- its in 1992 and beyond?\" Mr Lunn added that share- holders should consider where the Invergordon share price would be without W&M's offer. However, Dr Greig said that\" in the event of shareholders rejecting the W&M offer he believed the shares would con- tinue to be buoyed by specula- tion that another company might make make an offer for Invergordon. * COMMNIT W&M can complain as much as it likes about Invergordon's profit forecast, but it will not alter the fact that it will have substantially to increase its bid if it is to stand a good chance of winning the takeover battle. Invergordon may have pulled out all the stops to achieve its interim results. Yet there is no real reason why it should not be able to realise its impressive forecasts. W&M's offer puts Invergordon on a prospective multiple of 13.5 - below the expected market average of 14, and well below the company's prospective multiple of 16. American Brands' pockets are deep. An increased offer looks likely if W&M has set its heart on acquiring Invergordon.",

The Board of CMB Packaging, under the Chairmanship of Jean-Marie Descarpentries, is pleased to announce its unaudited consolidated interim results for the six months ended 30 June 1991. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (in FS millions First half First half unless otherwise stated) 1990 1991 91/90 * Turnover 11,606 12,532 +8% * Steel operating profit 114* * Packaging operating profit 996 1,144 +15% -as % of turnover 8.6% 9.1% * Net profit excluding extraordinary items 435 473 +9% * Earnings per share, based on average number of shares in issue (before extraordinary items) FS5.6 FS5.9 * Net debt 6,345 5,890 -7% * Net financial costs as % of turnover 3.1% 2.7% (including preference share dividends before tax) * Packaging Cashflow 903 1,106 +22% *'Including final contribution from the Steel Division which was sold during the first half of 1990. These results show clear progress in each of the three priority areas for 1991: * Internal growth * Increase in operating margin and productivity * Reduction of debt and financial costs. SUSTAINED INTERNAL GROWTH At FS 12,532 million consolidated turnover has increased by 8% on 1990. Using the same reporting structure and exchange rates, internal growth is +4.1%, the result of a sustained increase in most of the countries where the Group operates with the exception of the UK, adversely affected by a significant recession during the first half. Countries/Regions Intemal Growth 91/90 in % UK -1% MAINLAND EUROPE +6% ASIA, AFRICA, USA +10% The product lines have in general experienced strong growth with the exception of the Health/Beauty market and Paints for the construction industry which experienced weaker demand beginning in the second half of 1990. In particular, the European Food Can sector, which represents a third of turnover, has increased by 7%. The European Beverage Can sector, despite poor climatic conditions and decline in prices, has slightly increased its turnover. INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN AND PRODUCTIVITY Packaging operating profit has increased by 15% to FS 1,144 million. This represents an increase in operating margin to 9.1% of turnover in the first half of 1991 compared with 8.6% and 8% for the same period in 1990 and 1989 respectively. Productivity (half yearly turnover by employee at 30 June) has increased by 13% in one year. Packaging cashflowv is FS 1,106 million against FS 903 million, an increase of 22%. REDUCTION OF DEBT AND FINANCIAL COSTS Improved cashflow and a reduction of FS 560 million in working capital requirements has enabled the company to reduce its debt by FS 455 million between the end of June 1990 and the end of June 1991. Group net debt now stands at FS 5.9 billion of which FS 3.3 billion is in the form of perpetual subordinated notes and preference shares. Financial costs (including preference share dividends before tax) represented 2.7% of turnover in the first half of 1991 compared with 3.1% for the same period in 1990. Interest cover (operating profit/financial costs) has improved from 3.1 to 3.4, nearing the 3.5 minimum target set by the Group. Group equity (shareholders' equity and minority interests) amounted to FS 11,548 million, an increase of FS 629 million compared to 30 June 1990. The debt to equity ratio thus improved from 0.58 to 0.51 between the first half of 1990 and the first half of 1991. Attributable profit for the first half of 1991 is FS 473 million, an increase of 9% compared with the first half of 1990 (excluding extraordinary Steel items). This 1990 profit (excluding extraordinary items) included the final contribution from the Steel division amounting to FS 86 million after tax. Results at the end of August confirm the trend of the first half year. The continuing effort of the management team and all employees should result in sustained improvement in 1991's three priority areas. PROPOSED STRUCTURAL CHANGES The Board has decided to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders for 8 November 1991 in order to submit for their approval a resolution transforming CMB Packaging into a company with separate Supervisory and Management Boards. Such a structure is more suitable to the present stage of CMB Packaging's decentralised multinational activities. It will formalize the concept of a management team and will provide all shareholders, particularly the two groups who jointly control the company, MB Caradon and CGIP, with an adequate framework to fulfil their responsibilities concerning the orientation and the supervision of the company. Under these circumstances, Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the President Directeur Gdndral, has expressed his intention of ceasing his functions on 8 November 1991. The Board accepted his departure with regret and unanimously expressed its appreciation of Mr Dcscarpentries' outstanding achievements since 1982 as the head of Camaud S.A., and of his contribution to the establishment of CMB Packaging which has become Europe's leader in packaging. The two main shareholders have agreed to appoint Mr Peter Jansen of MB Caradon as Chairman of their Partners' Committee. They will propose that Mr Emcst-Antoine Seillibre of CGIP be Chairman of the future Supervisory Board, and that B. Jurgen Hintz be Chief Executive Officer and President of the future Management Board, which will also include Amaud Fayet, Nigel Gilson, Didier Oury and Bernard Rolley, currently members of the senior management team. Mr B. Jurgen Hintz, a US citizen, was born in Germany in 1942 and graduated with a degree in physics at the University of North Carolina, NC State. He has held a number of senior international positions at Proctor & Gamble, the US multinational where, during his nineteen years in Europe, he ran the Dutch and British businesses. Until recently, he was Executive Vice President responsible for the food, beverage and paper activities in the USA (turnover 7.5 billion US dollars) and a member of Proctor & Gamble's Board of Directors.

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox MAXWELL Communication Corporation, the international publishing conglomerate, will announce within weeks sales of businesses to cut debt from its present Â£1.35bn, Mr Robert Maxwell, chairman, said yes- terday at the group's annual meeting. MCC was negotiating to sell seven or eight peripheral busi- nesses and would repay the $750m (Â£434m) tranche of debt due in October 1992 ahead of schedule, he said. Another $1.06bn repayment is due in October 1994. Plans for demerger or flota- tion of US businesses, which account for 70 per cent of MCC's assets and 90 per cent of operating profit, were now being drawn up by Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Samuel Montagu, the UK bank. \"We anticipate we will be able to report the result of their deliberations before the end of this year,\" he said, but refused to com- ment on the options consid- ered. Mr Maxwell said that the increased shareholder value resulting from the re- construction would be dis- tributed to shareholders in cash or marketable US sec- urities. As expected, Mr Peter Walker, the former Cabinet minister left the MCC board yesterday. Mr Walker, who joined the company in April, was to have replaced Mr Maxwell as chair- man in July, but the planned restructuring would leave a small UK business unattrac- tive \"to someone of Mr Walk- er's standing\", Mr Maxwell said. Instead, Mr Maxwell will remain chairman although \"at the age of 68 I cannot give assurances it will be perma- nent\", he said. The acknowledgement of his mortality preceded a sober statement about UK and US interim trading, with \"no improvement yet despite what the Prime Minister and Presi- dent say\", but he nevertheless looked forward to the interim results with \"great confi- dence\".",

   "text_content" : "ENTERPRISE OIL, the UK's largest independent oil com- pany, yesterday reported a 26 per cent fall in after-tax profits for the six months to end-June, writes Roland Rudd. In spite of higher oil prices and increased turnover of Â£244m (Â£208m), net profits fell from Â£82m to Â£60.3m. The pre- tax result dropped to Â£78.9m (Â£102m). The company said the profit fall was mainly because there were no gains from asset dis- posals compared with Â£11.4m last year. Profits were also affected by an increase in dril- ling and consequential inc- rease in the exploration write-off to Â£41m (Â£17m). Mr Graham Hearne, chair- man and chief executive, said: \"These are good solid results. We remain on target to achieve our production levels. The investment programme is now more than Â£lbn over the next three years.\" Group production in the first half of 1991 was equivalent to 127,900 barrels of oil a day, a 10 per cent increase. Net interest income decreas- ed by Â£7.4m to Â£30.1m. Mr Hearne said that as the com- pany spent its cash on new developments its interest income was bound to fall. Enterprise spent Â£56.4m (Â£35.8m) on exploration and appraisal in the first half, and Mr Hearne said the level of activity had been one of the highest in the group's history. The interim dividend is lifted to 6.5p (6p). Earnings per share fell from 18p to 13.2p.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox OCEAN GROUP, the marine, freight and environmental ser- vices conglomerate, pushed pre-tax profits ahead by 3 per cent from Â£22.6m to Â£23.3m in the six months to June 30. Recent investment in marine services and interest on the April rights issue cash compen- sated for the impact of the Gulf war, US and UK recessions and a Â£2m adverse currency trans- lation. Trading profits rose by only 5 percent to Â£26.2m (Â£24.9m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Â£628.9m (Â£530.5m) as freight margins in particular came under pressure. The Â£88m rights issue reduced debt to EOÂ£10m at June 30 and gearing to 4 per cent from its pre-rights peak of about 50 per cent. Although interest on the rights cash contributed an extra Â£1.8m in the interim period, the interest charge rose by Â£500,000 to Â£3.4m. Earnings per share on the increased capital fell 6 per cent to 11.8p, against 12.6p (restated for the rights from 13.1p). The interim dividend goes up to 4.71p (4.67p). Marine Services, the only division to advance, pushed trading profits up to Â£14.8m (Â£10.7m). More than half the growth was organic with the continuing recovery in oilfield development and service and the remainder the full inclu- sion of Tees Towing, last year's acquisition which made Ocean the UK's largest tug business. The worst performer, Envi- ronmental Services, saw US laboratory testing and UK pro- cessing of industrial and con- struction waste hit by reces- sion, pushing trading profits down to Â£2.1m (Â£3.4m). Freight and distribution sus- fered a 5 per cent fall in profits to Â£10.5m (Â£llm) on turnover up 19 per cent at Â£532m. In spite of strong contract distribution, helped by Ser- ralta, last year's Spanish acquisition, the Gulf war severely disrupted freight for- warding. Group services' converted a loss of Â£1.2m to a profit of Â£1.5m by completion of Mill- wall Wharf, the London prop- erty. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, saw no immediate relief from recession, but hoped that it would provide a chance to pick up bolt-on acquisitions cheaply. The year's development spending would be maintained at about Â£70m, he said. * COMMENT Hit by the Gulf war, then deep- ening recession in the US and UK, Ocean did well to contain the damage to profits to 3 per cent. Shareholders can have no great gripes with the April rights issue, as the returns on development spending and on acquisitions, apart from the environmental laboratories, appear healthy. But the past few years - and these interims - have not demonstrated clearly that management can move the whole group forward at once. Despite yesterday's 13p fall in the shares to 366p, full-year profits of Â£56.5m and earnings of 28p give a p/e of 13.1, demanding unless that demonstration comes soon.",

   "text_content" : "By bronwen Maddox NURDIN & PEACOCK, the cash and carry wholesaler, lifted interim pre-tax profits from Â£6.65m to Â£6.97m as the benefit from new branches out- weighed the impact of the recession on both retailing and catering customers. The opening of new branches at Chester, Blackpool and Sheffield, and the continu- ing integration of meat depart- ments into branches, helped push turnover for the six months to June 30 ahead by 7 per cent from Â£603m to Â£647m. The fresh meat departments helped push operating margins to 0.85 per cent (0.68 per cent) in spite of recession-provoked price competition in selling to retailing and catering. Interest received fell to ?1.4m (Â£2.4m) because of lower interest rates and higher capi- tal expenditure of Â£18.8m (Â£17.4m). Cash was pulled down by the development programme to 250m from Â£65m at end-June 1990. An increase in shares for employee participation restrained earnings per share to a 3.7 per cent rise to 3.87p (3.73p), outstripped by the interim dividend, which is raised 4.8 per cent to 1.96p (1.87p). The group plans to open three new branches next year, a continuation of the group's northwards expansion, to Man- chester, and a replacement for the Brighton branch. Mr Nigel Hall, the finance director, said that the year's capital expenditure would be maintained at about Â£34m, and that year-end cash, at a sea- sonal low, is expected to be down on December 1990's Â£24m. Mr Hall said that a recent marginal improvement in trad- ing led to a slightly better out- look for the second half, and an 8 per cent increase in the year's overall sales might be achievable.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller HARRISONS & Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies and animal feed business, sus- fered a 37 per cent fall in pre- tax profit from Â£57.5m to Â£36.4m in the first half of the year. It held the interim dividend at 3.6p even though earnings per share fell 47 per cent to exactly that level. And it caused a flurry of unease with its comment on the final divi- dend. Mr David Hopkinson, in his swansong as chairman, said the directors would \"hope\" to maintain the final. Mr George Paul, chief execu- tive, later explained that the group intended to maintain the dividend unless the 1992 out- look was a good deal worse than expected. The interim payment needed a touch of support from reserves and analysts do not expect a maintained total of 9p to be covered by 1991 earnings per share. Turnover advanced to Â£908m (Â£878m). The results included a full six months' contribution from Crossley, the builders' merchant bought for Â£113m in May last year. It increased the Harcros chain from 136 to 248 outlets, slightly ahead of Jew- son, the Meyer International subsidiary. But the timber and building supplies division saw operating profits fall from Â£17m - or 220.8m if Crossley had been in for the full half - to Â£9.8m. UK sales volume fell 16 per cent, knocking Â£13.5m off profit, partly redeemed by savings. Mr Paul said about 30 Har- cros depots had been closed and across the division more than 1,000 jobs had been shed. A further round of job cuts was being implemented on the tim- ber side. Chemicals, also exposed to the building industry, fell to E16.4m (Â£28.4m) at the operat- ing level. In the US, there had been some pick-up in demand for chrome chemicals. On the organic side, polymer additives had proved most resilient, with adhesives and surfactants faring less well. George Paul: more Job losses on the timber side Better news came from food and agriculture, where operat- ing profit advanced to Â£16m (Â£14.9m). Plantations main- tained their operating profits at Â£5.1m. * COMMENT Profits at the lower end of expectations and some down- grading of forecasts combined to knock lip off the share price, which closed at 151p. This is similar to the level after the Crossley acquisition was announced, with a rights issue priced at 132p. Harrisons may be well placed for recov- ery - it serves the smaller builder who should benefit early from the return of con- sumer confidence - but it has got there at great expense, both in terms of acquisition cost and rationalisation pain. Leaving aside historic and cur- rent disappointment, pre-tax profit is expected to bounce back from about Â£85m this year to Â£110m-Â£120m next. A prospective p/e approaching 18 takes account of recovery pros- pects well into 1993. Assuming a maintained dividend, the price is supported by a yield of nearly 8 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By John Griffiths MR JOHN Neill, chief executive of Unipart, said that recession and the sharp down- turn in UK car sales had had a severe impact on the motor parts and accessories market, with total sales in the sector down 15 to 20 per cent \"and no improvement in sight\". The downturn initially tempted Unipart, the former parts and accessories division of Rover Group, to \"batten down the hatches\" and launch cut-backs, said Mr Neill, com- menting on the group's interim results. Instead, Unipart launched a large-scale marketing pro- gramme with the consequence that half-year sales fell by only 1.7 per cent to Â£292.2m (Â£297.2m), while pre-tax profits rose by 16 per cent to Â£6.7m (Â£5.8m). Unipart no longer reports the separate financial perfor- mances of its three main divi- sions. However, Unipart Indus- tries, the parts manufacturing group, was said by Mr Neill to have recorded \"good\" results and to be now set firmly on an expansionary course as a result of its UK links with both Rover and Honda, with which Rover has 20 per cent cross- shareholdings. Mr Neill was speaking as Premier Exhausts, a Unipart Industries subsidiary at Coven- try, was reaching the final commissioning stages of a new automated catalytic converter plant which is to supply both existing UK-built Rover and Honda models and the 100,000- cars-per-year manufacturing facility Honda is to bring on stream at Swindon late next year. Unipart International, the parts and accessories distribu- tion division, was primarily responsible for maintaining the group's sales. Its contract dis- tribution business, however, was badly hit by the recession although Mr Neill gave no fig- ures. The Unipart group, which is owned by its directors, employ- ees and a small group of insti- tutions - with Rover main- taining a minority stake - also reduced its first-half inter- est charges to one third of last time's levels.",

   "text_content" : "By John Thornhill BUNZL, the paper and packaging distribution group, yesterday struck a gloomy note by announcing a 32 per cent drop in interim profits and warn- ing that the recession looked set to con- tinue for the rest of the year. \"The hoped-for recovery in economic activity has not yet materialised,\" said Mr David Kendall, chairman. That statement, coupled with a cut in the interim dividend from 2.6p to 1.8p, sent Bunzl's shares tumbling to close 13p down at 91p. Mr Kendall said: \"We decided the div- idend cut was the wise thing to do. We do not know what tomorrow will look like and the concept of living a little now and paying later was unacceptable to us.\" Bunzl became the third big company in the paper and packaging sector in recent days to cast doubt on the govern- ment's claims that the economic pall is lifting. Traditionally the sector is one of the first to benefit from an upturn in eco- nomic activity, but last week Bowater, which supplies packaging products across a range of industries, said it was \"damn difficult\" to see an end to the recession. The grim outlook was echoed on Tuesday by Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group. During the half year to June 30, Bunzl saw taxable profits fall from Â£30.4m to Â£20.6m. Sales fell by 9 per cent to Â£693.4m (Â£763.7m). All Bunzl's divisions recorded a fall in operating profits. In the distribution field, paper and plastics contributed operating profits of Â£12.6m (Â£14.6m); printing and writing papers Â£8.5m (Â£8.9m); and building materials Â£700,000 (Â£2.8m). Manufacturing activities were also badly hit with operating profits from cigarette filters falling to Â£4.2m (Â£5.4m) and plastic products yielding Â£3m (Â£3.9m). A higher interest charge 'took a fur- ther Â£4.9m (Â£2.3m). Earnings per share slipped from 4.3p to 2.9p. * COMMENT Although it may provoke the ire of some institutional investors, Bunzl's move to cut the dividend seemed the sensible thing to do, especially if - as the company firmly believes - this recession still has some way to run. But perhaps shareholders should not be too dispirited. The burdens of advance cor- poration tax strongly influenced the decision, which can also be viewed as a healthy piece of financial prudence - in marked contrast to the wild acquisi- tive days of the 1980s that went before. The newly-appointed chief executive looks set to bring a greater sense of urgency to the process of consolidation with the Collins food services business in the US and the Wycombe Marsh papers company looking like early can- didates for treatment. Pre-tax profit forecasts for the year have been trimmed to Â£44m with an expected cut in the final dividend to 4p. But although looking heavy at present on a prospective multiple of 14, Bunzl's shares may soon begin to look better value if its heavy exposure in the US picks up speed in line with the econ- omy.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay CAIRD, the waste management company that last year saw off a hostile bid from Severn Trent by back-tracking on its own trading forecast, yesterday reported a sharp rise in profits suggesting the company has turned a corner. Pre-tax profits rose from Â£1.81m to Â£3.11m in the six months to June 30 on sales trimmed 18 per cent to Â£13.24m after closures. Mr John Ashton, chairman, said the results confirmed that the company had returned to a profitable growth path from businesses focused on core waste management activities. Earnings rose 92 per cent to 2p and the interim dividend goes up 11 per cent to 1.33p. Mr Ashton said the Â£5.85m extraordinary provision taken in 1990 against off-balance sheet property developments was enough to cover antici- pated losses and the closure of some industrial services busi- nesses. Margins on landfill operations, where three quar- ters of operating profits are derived, rose from 60 per cent to 70 per cent as the group found more efficient ways of using its sites. Mr Ashton said Caird had enough sites to allow organic growth without the need for further acquisitions. Profits in the hazardous, toxic and chemical waste divi- sion recovered sharply to Â£488,000 from near break-even after management changes at one of the subsidiaries. Mr Ashton said Caird had been granted draft re-registra- tion of its incinerator at Ren- frew, Strathclyde, to accord with new Industrial Pollution Inspectorate standards. * COMMENT If only folks would stick with what they know best - which for Caird, as for many others, was not property development. But with that flirtation behind it, the chastened, cleaner Caird looks something of a one-way bet. Either Severn Trent makes another bid for control - Sev- ern Trent's Biffa would dearly like Caird's landfill assets - in which case Severn will have to pay considerably more than the o100p offer it withdrew a year ago. Alternatively, if Sev- ern declines to bid - perhaps to avoid catching the eye of the prowling water regulator - Caird can expect to continue improving fat margins on scarce landfill sites, helped by an increasingly tough regula- tory climate. Full year fore- casts of Â£6.3m, give earnings of 4.5p and a prospective multiple of 23.5 which, though some- what inflated by a bid pre- mium, may not be far from where Caird in renewed Green livery should be.",

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto ICELAND FROZEN Foods lifted pre-tax profits for the six months to June 29 by 16 per cent, from Â£17.6m to Â£20.3m, as it finally started to reap the benefits of the acquisition of Belam. The improved performance came on turnover of Â£412.8m (Â£339.1m) reflecting strong growth across all geographic areas. Mr Malcolm Walker, chair- man and chief executive, said that the decision to abandon the Bejam product range and revert to its own retail formula was proving particularly suc- cessful in bringing back cus- tomers it had lost subsequent to the acquisition. The integration of the Bejam stores, which took longer than anticipated after the acquisi- tion in 1989, had progressed substantially. Sales between refitted Bejam stores and origi- nal Iceland stores showed less than one percentage point dif- ference in the first half. Sales of freezers and fridges attained record levels, showing a like-for-like increase of 17 per cent. The group refitted 25 stores and opened 20 new stores, bringing the total to 515. The balance sheet, weakened by the high level of capital investment needed to integrate the Bejam stores, is slowly being repaired. Although borrowings are not likely to fall substantially with- out property disposals, gearing is expected to come down to 60 per cent by the end of the year on a larger net asset base. This would compare with borrowings at the year-end of about Â£81m and gearing of 73 per cent on net assets of Â£ll11m. If planned property sales go through borrowings could come down to about Â£72m and gearing to 55 per cent. Interest charges rose to Â£5.91m (Â£5.88m), although this was net of interest capitalised on freehold developments of Â£452,000. The interim dividend is increased to 2.65p (2.3p), pay- able from fully diluted earn- ings of 14.09p (11.86p) per share.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent BUTTE MINING, which has not made a profit since it was listed in London four years ago, is raising another Â£5.6m, new management reported yesterday after re- vealing that the company sus- fered a loss before tax of Â£7.07m in the 18 months to June 30. In the previous year there was a loss of Â£943,000. It has not been cheap to attract new management to Butte. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, a former managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields, has a three-year contract guaranteeing him at least Â£100,000 a year plus other benefits. Mr Bill Hooley, the new managing director, has a three- year contract for Â£71,500 a year. Mr Lloyd-Jacob, who was recruited by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL), said yesterday he would spend most of his work- ing time on Butte and he would not have taken the job for less. The intention was to build Butte into a sizeable mining finance group and, if this proved possible, it would need management with large-com- pany experience He said the new manage- ment had already taken action to reduce costs and correct cer- tain operating problems. Butte is to raise Â£3.1m via a placing of convertible prefer- ence shares with warrants at l0p per share, underwritten by CLL. The shares were unchanged at 4%p last night. Shareholders will be offered a further Â£2.5m of the convert- ible on the basis of 2 prefer- ence shares with one warrant for every 16 ordinary shares held. The offer is not underwritten and any shortfall will be avail- able for placing. Mr Lloyd-Ja- cob said he expected few share- holders to take up the offer but most of the convertible would be placed. Fees and other expenses are expected to take about Â£350,000. The proceeds would be used to repay an A$1.6m gold loan facility owed by Butte's VAM subsidiary to Security Pacific Gold; to bring the company's Zirceram plant at Stoke in the UK on stream, and settle litiga- tion by creditors of that com- pany; and reduce the group's debts. Four big creditors have agreed to schedule payments to coincide with Butte's cash flow.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger PLAXTON, the coachbuilder and motor distributor, reversed into losses during the first half of 1991, reflecting a sharp downturn in the coach and bus industry. The deficit amounted to Â£4.51m pre-tax, compared with profits of Â£5.21m last time. Turnover fell by 17 per cent to Â£182.5m. Mr David Matthews, chair- man, said that all of the loss could be attributed to interest charges of Â£1.92m (Â£1.77m), and exceptional restructuring and new model costs of Â£2.57m. There was an exceptional credit of Â£2.44m last time. An extraordinary charge of Â£1.7m was taken against any future rationalisation costs. Mr Matthews said the results reflected the worst recession ever experienced in the coach and bus business, which repre- sents about 32 per cent of turn- over. New vehicle registrations in this division were 50 per cent down on the previous year. He warned that the group was likely to make a loss in the second half - albeit not as great as this time. During the first half, Plaxton cut 20 per cent of manufactur- ing jobs, streamlined operat- ions and closed some produc- tion lines. The motor division suffered from a 19 per cent decline in new car sales, although the parts and services businesses held steady. Plaxton, which holds a range of car dealerships, bought two Ford outlets during the period for Â£4m. The group plans to revive its fortunes with the launch next month of a new range of coaches and buses. Mr Robert Wood, managing director, said the range would allow Plaxton to sell into Europe and the group had already entered an agreement with Volvo to supply vehicle bodies for distribution in France. Losses per share were 12.2p, compared with earnings of 10.9p. The interim dividend is cut from 3p to Ip."

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday cleared a Franco- American consortium's acqui- sition of the television inter- ests of WH Smith Group, the UK retailer, which include Screensport, the English-lan- guage sports channel. After a one-month automatic investigation, the Commission decided that the competitors of WH Smith's European Sports Network, which broadcasts in four European languages including English, were strong enough to keep genuine com- petition alive in the sec- tor. They decided this in spite of the involvement in the consortium of other European broadcasters such as Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel. Brussels also took into account the fact that even after the takeover the European Sports Network would still command a comparatively low share of the satellite TV market. Screensport's principal com- petitor, Eurosport - now backed by TF1, the French channel - briefly went off the air earlier this year and was forced to look for new finance after a Commission decision that its ownership structure breached European Commu- nity competition rules. WH Smith announced last month that it would sell its two satellite television chan- nels, four production service companies and Cable Jukebox service to the consortium for Â£45m. The consortium consists of Canal Plus; ESPN, which is controlled by the US communi- cations group Capital Cities/ ABC, in partnership with Hearst Corporation; and Gen- drale d'Images, a subsidiary of Gendrale des Eaux, the French water and services company.",

   "text_content" : "By Stlaft WagStyl in Tokyo JAPAN's big four stockbrokers are preparing to issue profit warnings for the six months to the end of September, amid dif- ficult conditions caused by a slump in securities trading and by finanial scandals. The four companies - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are due to report half-year results at the end of October. But they are widely expected to issue estimates before the end of this month in order to warn the stock market of impending sharp profit reductions. A Daiwa official said: \"My per- sonal guess is all of us may make a statement next week.\" Surveys carried out by news- papers indicate that the bro- kers' pre-tax profits may fall by 60 to 100 per cent. In the latest published report, Asahi news- paper estimated that Nomura's profits would be around Y40bn ($S00m) pre-tax, down by about 60 per cent, Daiwa's would fail 70 per cent and Nikko's 50 per cent. Yamaichi, which made Y30.4bn in the same period last year, could be close to falling into the red, said the Asahi. Yamaichi said the estimate was the newspaper's own, but it did not dispute the figures. The company said it would issue its own estimate shortly. An official at another of the big four said: \"These figures are unofficial, but they are based on authoritative data.\" The main reason for the col- lapse in brokers' profits is the decline in trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the mainstay of their business. The slump is affecting smaller Japanese houses more severely, with nine out of 10 second-tier col- si the inteerimtperiod. Scandals in the securities industry - involving pay- ments of compensation to favoured clients and dealings with a criminal organisation - have also played a part in driv- ing away business. Many pri- vate investors have stopped trading in disgust. So have some large overseas clients - the latest to do so was the World Bank, the Wash- ington-based aid fund, which has deleted Nomura and Nikko from its list of underwriters for bond issues. Nomura and Nikko were singled out because they have admitted links to a gangster group, whereas Daiwa and Yamaichi have not.",

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York TENNECO, the Texas-based industrial and energy group, yesterday announced plans for a restructuring, including more than $lbn of asset sales and a dividend cut, as it warned of a likely 1991 loss. It said that due to depressed market conditions its J. I. Case agricultural and construction business was expecting 1991 operating losses substantially greater than anticipated. Case is to undertake a plant and product rationalisation programme to \"assure its long-term competitive posi- tion\" and this will mean a sig- nificant restructuring charge by the end of 1991. The news hit Tenneco's shares, which closed at $40%, down $2%, but bolstered Deere, the other leading US maker of farm equipment, which closed at $52%, up $2. The two compa- nies control about 85 per cent of the US farm equipment busi- ness and analysts said over- production by Case last sum- mer had depressed prices. Its rationalisation moves should reduce the discounting. Tenneco, whose lacklustre performance has left Wall Street unhappy, is in the throes of a leadership change. Mr James Ketelsen, its chair- man, is to be succeeded at the start of next year by Mr Mich- ael Walsh, former chairman of Union Pacific Railroad. Mr Walsh took over as presi- dent of Tenneco at the start of this month, and yesterday's package was presented as the joint initiative of the two men. They said it was aimed at strengthening the company's balance sheet, increasing financial flexibility, assuring long-term earnings prospects and bolstering Case. The company is halving its dividend from 80 cents to 40 cents in the fourth quarter, which will boost annual retained earnings by $200m. It plans to sell $500m of non- core assets by the end of this calendar year, including a plant under construction to process MTBE, a petrol addi- tive; its gold mining operations; and its Viscosity Oil company.",

The future of two French factc ries making similar shoes would be considered over the next few weeks, the company said. It added that consumers no longer wanted the polyure- thane-soled shoes made in these plants. Thtinfeld makes 2m pairs a year and a further Im pairs come from France. \"Demand for 1992 is estimated at about 800,000 pairs,\" said Mr Ren6 JAggi, chief executive. Market conditions have dete- riorated since earlier this year, when Adidas proposed to reduce costs by moving the production and staff from Thunfeld to Scheinfeld. But, as Mr Jiggi said yesterday, cost savings were not enough in the present situation. Scheinfeld will be the only Adidas shoe plant in Germany.",

I LORAINE GOLD MINES, LTD. (Incorporated in the Republic ofSouth Asti Reg. No. 05/39138/06 Rationalsation Progrname On 18 April 1991. ihe Company announced a futher sationalisation programme which entailed a reduction in the mill throughput to approximately 113 000 tons per month and the retrenuhment of about 8 per cent of officials and union men and some 6,3 per cent of category 1-8 employees and staff. Members were informnned that further contingency plans would have to be considered if that ationalisation programme did not achieve the objective of minimising working losses . As a consequence of the secent relatively static R/Kg gold price received by the Company coupled with the negative impact of on-going inflation, the readily accessible payable ore reserves have decreased to the point where milling operations cannot be sustained at a rate of about 113 000 tons per month without substantial increases in the mining and processing of other than fully payble ore, which would give rise to unacceptable monthly losses. Accordingly, it has now become necessasy to conduct mining operations on a more selective basis and phased reductions of the underground mining and related milling raes down to 90 000 tons per month are being implemented with the objective of at least eliminating monthly losses. If, by the end of November 1991, this objective has not been achieved and is not hen seen tobe readily achievable, theremay be no aternative but to consider a phased mine closure programme. Regrettably, the phased reductions of the underground minin and related millling rat necessitate fuather srenanent -now being implnmeied -f about 14 per cutof offidcials and union men and some 11 per cent of Category 1-8 employees and staff.

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York AMERICAN Airlines, one of the top three US carriers, sent a shiver through the commer- clal aerospace Industry yester- day when it announced plans for a $500Sm cut in its five-year capital spending programme, including deferring options to buy some aircraft or allowing them to lapse altogether. Its statement increased con- cern that the aircraft manufac- turing industry could face a significant reduction in its order book over the next few years due to the financial problems of the world's airline indstry, and of US carriers in The world's three leading aircraft manufacturers - Boe- ing, Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas - all have extremely full order books stretching years ahead, and have repeatedly said that they have suffered no significant cancellations because of the airline industry's current diffi- culties. Mr Robert Crandall, chair- man of American, announced the capital spending reduction at an analysts' meeting in New York but gave no details of how the cuts would be allo- cated. He said American had already pushed back some air- craft options and planned to talk with manufacturers about sliding them back further, or allowing them to lapse. The reduction is relatively small when set alongside the airline's plan to spend some $21bn on capital programmes between 1991 and 1995, some $15bn of it on aircraft. More- over, the cutbacks involve Just options and not firm orders, and will therefore not have any immediate impact on air- craft manufacturers for the next year or two. However, analysts said that any cutback by an airline as prominent as American was not good news for the industry and underlined that the peak of the ordering cycle was past Mr Crandall said many prob- lems were caused by Ameri- can's ailing US rivals, which cut fares to raise cash. That made absolutely no sense in such a long-term, capital intensive industry.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in GOtersloh BERTELSMANN, the world's second largest publishing and media concern, is to spend DMs.5bn ($5.45bn) on an expan- sion spree over the next three years, according to Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive. As well as extending its interests in German pay-TV and daily newspapers in the east of the country, the group will launch a new business magazine in France. It has joined the bidding for a licence for a 24-hour televi- sion news channel in the domestic market. \"Strategic feelers\" have been put out to seek broadcasting possibilities in eastern Europe, and, accord- ing to Mr W6ssner, Bertels- mann would \"certainly\" be interested in buying into Brit- ish commercial TV in future. Announcing a 9 per cent Mark Wassner: may buy into British commercial TV increase in turnover and a 6 per cent rise in net profit for the year ended June 1991, Mr W6ssner said he was more than happy with the results, considering the difficulties in the US which accounts for a third of group sales. Total sales of DM14.5bn, compared with DM18.Sbn last time, would have been DMSOOm higher if the dollar had not been so weak against the D-Mark, he added. But turnover growth of more than 23 per cent in the domestic market amply compensated for weaknesses abroad, where sales rose only 18 per cent. Operating profits rose to DM1.04bn from DM950m and net income was DM540m com- pared with DM910m last time. German language book pub- lishing and clubs showed a 24 per cent increase in sales, and broadcasting did better than planned with a 30 per cent rise. However, the music and video side - the largest division, and heavily dependent on the US - rose only 4.5 per cent. The group is making rapid proess in eastern Germany Sspite of political difficulties and price controls, which keep the cost of newspapers, for example, to about one-third of prices in the west. In the past 18 months, Bertelsmann has increased its newspaper circu- lation in the region to almost 2m copies daily, and it has signed up Im east German members for its book clubs. * Mr Jiirgen Todenh6fer, chief executive of the Burda maga- sine publishing group, yester- day dubbed 1990 the \"super year\". Turnover rose 11 per cent to DM1.25bn and profits after tax improved 35 per cent to DM29m.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dulitorce in Geneva NESTLE, the world's biggest foods group, yesterday posted a 3.5 per cent advance in first- half net earnings to just over SFrlbn ($676m) and confirmed that profits for 1991 as a whole would be higher than the SFr2.27bn recorded last year. Group turnover, reported in July, rose by 2.2 per cent to SFr23.2bn. Excluding the effect of new acquisitions, sales increased by 4.5 per cent in vol- ume, ahead of the 4 per cent target for the year as a whole set in May by Mr Helmut Maucher, managing director. Advances in sales were recorded in Europe - particu- larly in Germany - Asia and Latin America, where Brazil staged a strong recovery. There was no overall increase in sales in North America, which accounted for some 25 per cent of group turnover. A 3 per cent average devalu- ation of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc com- pared with the first half of 1990 restricted growth in the value of sales to 2.2 per cent. Assum- ing that the dollar maintains roughly its present level, the currency effect should be favourable during the second half, Nestle said. Trading profit at SFr2.1bn advanced by 2 per cent com- pared with the first half of 1990. Pre-tax earnings were almost identical at SFrl.7bn, a fall in net financing costs not compensating sufficiently for SFrl54m in non-trading expenses which included charges for restructuring. Capital spending increased by 1.3 per cent to SFrl.l3bn and SFr417m was spent on acquisitions. The group balance sheet at June 30 showed liquid assets of SFr4bn, down from SFr5.5bn at the end of December, and net debts of SFr6.4bn against SFr5.8bn six months earlier. These changes are attributed to seasonal factors, in particu- lar variations during the year in working capital needs, and to exchange rate fluctuations.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Taylor In Stockholrr KINNEVIK, the Swedish investment group, is selling for SKr800m ($130m) its steel sub- sidiary, Kloster Speedsteel, to Eramet, the French state-con- trolled industrial group and one of the world's largest nickel producers. Kloster Speedsteel had a turnover of SKr900m last year. Its new owner, with a SKr2.5bn turnover in 1990, is 70 per cent owned by the Esap, the French state holding company. Last year, Easp acquired Commen- tryenne, Kloster's largest com- petitor. Mr Daniel Johannesson, Kin- nevik's chief executive, said Kloster would be strengthened as a result of the deal and the change of ownership would not lead to any great changes in its business activities. The divestment should help to improve Kinnevik's sinan- cial position. Yesterday, it announced a drop in first-half profits to SKrl6.5m from SKrl56.3m for the same period of last year. In a profits fore- cast for the rest of 1991, how- ever, it said there would be positive growth. The sale of Kloster came on the same day that Kinnevik won the franchise to broadcast Sweden's first land-based com- mercial television channel. At present, the London based company runs the Swedish lan- guage satellite network TV3. It beat off the challenge for the lucrative franchise from TV4, its satellite rival.",

   "text_content" : "By John Grifflths in Frankfurt A WARNING of a further fall in net income this year for PSA, the French Peugeot and Citrodn vehicles group, was given yesterday by Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman. PSA made a net profit last year of FFr9.26bn ($1.56bn), down from FFrlO.3bn in 1989, and Mr Calvet made it plain at the Frankfurt motor show yes- terday that this year's profits would be reduced further by the current downturn in west European car sales. He said that earnings for this year's first half had yet to be finalised, \"but they will obvi- ously be lower\" - although higher than those recently announced by other manufac- turers of volume cars in Europe. However, Mr Calvet was rel- atively optimistic about the prospects of a recovery in some key European car markets in the final months of the year. * Mercedes-Benz, the German vehicles group, was on course for double-digit sales growth this year and was now certain to exceed even the DM65bn ($37.30bn) target set for 1991, Mr Werner Niefer, chief execu- tive, said yesterday. The group's car and commer- cial vehicle sales last year were worth DM59.8bn.",

Although National had previously announced its structu pans, analysts cad expected the company to return a small profit on operations. The company's stock price fell by 11 per cent to $4%, its lowest point since January. It reported a net loss of $168m, or $1.64 a share, compared with a net loss of $165.5m, or $1.63, in the corresponding period last year. The first-quarter results include a $149.3m charge taken. in connection with the company's plans to consolidate Its worldwide manufacturing capacity. The losses for the first quarter a year ago included a restructuring charge, of $143.6m. Sales for the first quarter declined to $411m from $442.7m for the comparable quarter a year ago. The company attributed the revenue drop to softness in the personal computer and peripherals markets, au well as to continued slow demand in the mainframe computer sector. National plans to eliminate excess production capacity, which has been \"the most significant factor affecting the company's financial performance,\" according to Mr Gilbert Amelio, National Semiconductor president and chief executive. \"We expect business conditions to remain soft throughout calendar year 1991,\" he said. SIBM, in a significant ster toward implementing \"open systems\" standards on its highest performance computers, intends to offer a version of AT&T's Unix operating system to run on its mainframe computers. The company, breaking with its adherence to proprietary software for mainframe computers, said it would offer a version of Unix based on the Software Foundation's OSS/1 operating system. IBM mainframe running the AK/ ESA software would be compatible with other Unix computers, IBM said.",

Posgold said operating prof- its rose to A$55m from A$25m on turnover up to A$128m from A$92m. However, net profits fell from A$31m to A$14m after an abnormal loss of A$34m. The abnormal loss related largely to a loss of A$28m on the sale of an 11.5 per cent holding in Newcrest Mining, and an earlier failed takeover bid for the company. The A$194m write-off, which was treated as an extraordi- nary item, was announced ear- lier this year, when Posgold decided to adjust the carrying value of holdings in Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (GKM) and Mount Leyshon Gold Mines. The adjustment followed a fall in gold prices and the introduction of corporate taxa- tion on the profits of gold pro- ducers. GKM, which is 29 per cent- owned by Posgold, yesterday announced a 35 per cent fall in net profits to A$16.4m. Mount Leyshon, which is a 49.4 per cent subsidiary, said net prof- its fell from A$49.5 to A$30m. Mr Steven Dean, Posgold's executive director, said lower spot prices for gold and the impact of the gold tax were expected to ld to decreased net profits In the current year. Posgold directors declared a final dividend of 15 cents a share, making a total dividend of 35 cents, compared with 55 cents last year. The company's shares closed 3 cents lower on the Australian Stock Exchange, at A$1.30. GEM was unchanged at 62 cents, and Mount Leyshon was unchanged at A$8.04.",

The news comes a week after Searle said it would take a 12.25 per cent stake in Tokyo- based Hokuriku Seiyaku. Ana- lysts believe there is a growing trend of alliances between US and Japanese pharmaceuticals companies. According to Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly in New York, Japanese compa- nies are compelled to increase their international presence for growth, while US companies are trying to expand their pres- ence in Japan, the world's sec- ond biggest market The news helped shares in American Home Products gain $1% to $64%/ on the New York Stock Exchange. AHP and Eisai will form a new corporation, Wyeth-Eisai, with a combined sales force of 1,200 people to promote the joint venture products. AHP will provide some marketing, sales, clinical research and development and administra- tive staff, partly through its existing wholly-owned Japa- nese subsidiary, Wyeth (Japan). Esisai will contribute some products to the joint venture, including its Clinimeal nutri- tional product, in addition to management, and sales exper- tise. It will also help to recruit and train employees. As part of the deal, AHP will provide Eisai with regulatory and developmental assistance in the US and Canada. AHP had 1990 pre-tax income of $1.8bn on sales of $6.7bn, while Eisai had 1990 sales of about Y205.5bn ($1.4bn). Wyeth-Eisai will have capi- talisation of Y2bn, or $15m, with 49.9 per cent held by Eisai and 50.01 by AHP.",

Petrocan said the decision was prompted by market conditions and by discussions with prospective purchasers of part of its 17 per cent stake in Syncrude, which has been up for sale for some time. Syncrude, which extracts oil from tarsands, contributes almost about one-third of Petrocan's crude oil production. The company said it was also reviewing other parts of its business to identify assets which could be sold as part of an effort \"to remedy unacceptable levels of profitability\". Petrocan's debut as a public company has not been a happy one. Less than a month after it was listed, it announced a second-quarter loss of C$97m, bringing the first-half loss to C$149m. Its share price has remained below the issue price of C$13, trading before yesterday's announcement at C$12.25. The federal government retains an 80 per cent stake in Petro- can.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney S.A. BREWING Holdings, the diversified Australian food and manufacturing group, yester- day reported a 15 per cent increase in net profits to A$101m (US$79.2m) for the year to end-June. Turnover was up 11 per cent at A$1.9bn. The result runs counter the trend of lower profits among large Australian companies, many of which have been hit hard by the 18-month reces- sion. The group said it expec- ted a further increase in profits in the current year. The bulk of last year's improvement came from the beverage and food operation, which raised operating profits by 33 per cent to A$68m, largely because of higher sales of Australian beers. The wine division, Austra- lia's biggest winemaker, broke even after taking account of financing costs related to the A$375m acquisition of Penfolds Wines in November. The division, which is being rationalised, hopes to benefit from a surge in demand for Australian wines, which are being heavily, promoted in Europe, the Far East and North America. Mr Ross Wilson, chief execu- tive, said the group was explor- ing a range of opportunities for expansion in Europe and the US as part of its strategy of concentrating ion wine and home appliances. However, Mr Wilson said S.A. Brewing may withdraw from the proposed purchase of Mor-Flo Industries, a US manu- facturer of water heaters, if the deal is not completed by December. The A$32m acquisition was announced in May and was to have been completed in August, but has been delayed by the US Justice Department, whose approval is required. The acquisition of Mor-Flo would complement the group's existing US water heater busi- ness and make it the US mar- ket leader with 30 per cent of sales. Mr Wilson said the group's increased profit was \"a pleas- ing result in the toughest year I have seen. Fortunately, we have a good mix of businesses now which are not as adversely affected as some\". Most Australian industrial companies would be fortunate to achieve a 5 per cent increase in net profits in the current year, but S.A. Brewing would exceed that level, he said. The group was in \"pretty good shape\" as a result of cost reductions, and would be posi- tioned to benefit if the econ- omy recovers, as expected, by the end of the first quarter of the 1992 calendar year. The board announced a final dividend of 7.5 cents, fully franked, making a total divi- dend of 15 cents, compared to 14.5 cents last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Joyce Quek in Singapore SINGAPORE Telecom, the country's most profitable statu- tory board, has surged past the S$2bn (US$1.2bn) mark in group operating income for the first time, leaping 12 per cent to S$2.2bn for the year to the end of March. Operating expenditure rose 7 per cent to S$1.4bn, and the company's total operating sur- plus before contributions to the state's consolidated fund and tax climbed to S$S.lbn, compared with S$888m in 1990. The board said the increase was due largely to higher con- tributions from international telephone services and mobile communications, as well as ctinuin imprpvements in A study examining privatisa- tion of the board is in its final stages. Singapore Telecom is expected to be corporatised and listed on the stock exchange in 1992 with a proj- ected market capitalisation of S$1Obn, making it the largest company listed since Singapore Airlines. Singapore Telecom plans to spend S$3.7bn over the next five years on expanding infra- structure and services.",

   "text_content" : "By Keovn Brown AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Minerals (ACM) yesterday stepped up its defence against a hostile takeover bid by West- ern Mining Corporation (WMC) and Normandy Posei- don by taking legal action against the bidders. The action, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, seeks to pre- vent WMC and Normandy vot- ing their shares in ACM at a shareholders' meeting later this month. The meeting will be asked to approve the sale of a 50 per cent share in the group's Mount Keith nickel project to Outokumpu Metals and Resources of Finland. WMC has warned that the bid would lapse if the sale is approved by shareholders. The offer, through a joint venture vehicle called Resplendid, is structured to allow WMC to take full control of the Mount Keith project, with ACM's gold mines and other assets going to Normandy Poseidon. The deal would give WMC secure access to the low grade ore at Mount Keith, in West- ern Australia, which could be used to feed its nickel smelter at nearby Kambalda. ACM announced earlier this week that it had received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board for the sale of half of Mount Keith to Outokumpu, which would also take management control. The Finnish group would retain most of the mine's reve- nue for the next two decades in return for an initial pay- ment to ACM of A$80m (US$63.5m). WMC and Normandy last week increased their bid from 90 cents a share to A$1.11, valuing ACM at A$260m. The bidders have said the offer is \"final\" and will not be increased. ACM shares last night closed at A$1.08 on the Austra- lian Stock Exchange, 3 cents below the offer price.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawith in Johannesburg THE LORAINE gold mine in South Africa has announced that it would cut production in order to curb mounting losses. It also has raised the prospect of a phased closure if losses were not stemmed by reducing output. The move reflects the ongo- ing squeeze the industry has experienced as a result of low gold prices and continuing cost inflation. Loraine, managed by the Anglovaal group, said that it would cut back the rate at which ore was milled to 90,000 tonnes a month from 113,000 tonnes. For the first nine months of Loraine's current financial year to end-September, the mine made a total loss of R8.79m ($3.1m). If these latest steps did not succeed in elimi- nating monthly losses by the end of November, phased clo sure of the mine would be con- sidered. Earlier this year the Gencor group closed the Stilfontein mine. The production cuts at Loraine will involve staff reductions of 11 to 14 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) plans to change its procedures for debt-offering sales, following the discovery that Salomon Brothers and several other unnamed Wall Street firms had exaggerated customer orders and filed false reports, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Fannie Mae is the first agency to change its procedures as a result of the continuing investigations into activities of Salomon and other securities dealers. Another agency, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), said that it had also received inaccurate information about customer orders from dealers. It said it had already introduced audit procedures to uncover irregularities, but indicated that further changes might be made. Fannie Mae is reviewing its relationship with Salomon, which is one of its 56-member selling group that sells long-term Fannie Mae debt to finance the mortgage portfolio. The mortgage association markets its bonds to the selling group in negotiated sales. Fannie Mae is asking all the members for further details on the practice of inflating customer orders. The association has issued $91.bn of total debt as of June 30. At the start of government investigations into charges that Salomon manipulated the Treasury security market, the broker admitted that it had regularly overstated the amount of customer orders it had received for a range of government securities. It has now been revealed that Salomon also said it had exaggerated the amount of customer orders reported to Fannie Mae and kept records of the false estimates to make sure it received the securities it needed.",

   "text_content" : "SIR David Scholey, chairman of S.G. Warburg, yesterday strongly defended the UK merchant bank against sugges- tions that it had turned a blind eye to Salomon Brothers' rigging of a US govern- ment bond auction this year, writes Rich- ard Waters. His comments came as Mr Gerald Cor- rigan, president of the US Federal Reserve, said that Fed and Treasury officials would meet Warburg executives to find out why they had failed to report the Salomon rule violation. The Fed added later that the meeting would be held today. According to a Salomon statement to Congress last week, Mr Paul Mozer, the dismissed head of government bond trad- ing at Salomon, had asked a Warburg executive not to respond to a Treasury letter about bids made in Warburg's name at the February government bond auction. The bid was made without Warburg's approval. Sir David said yesterday that no US offi- cials had sought information from War- burg about the February auction. Of Mr Mozer's contact with Warburg, he said: \"He said they had made a mistake and they'd correct it. There was nothing to discuss with the Fed as we saw it.\" He said Warburg had later received a letter from the Fed stating that, in future Treasury auctions, bids by Warburg and Mercury Asset Management would be aggregated in arriving at the group's over- all bid. But the Fed did not request any infor- mation. \"It was just a statement of policy,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb in London and Patrick Harverson in New York JAPANESE government bonds rose to highs for the year due to dealers covering their short positions and rumours of heavy trading in non-govern- ment debt. The government bond futures contract reached a high for the year of 98.54 in Tokyo, while the yield on the bench- mark No 129 bond, which opened at 6.25 per cent, reached 6.17 per cent and closed at 6.175 per cent. Trad- ers said the price of the No 129 GOVERNMENT BONDS government bond was pushed up by short-covering once the yield broke through 6.2 per cent, which is an important support level. Cash market volumes were lower than usual, with only Y601bn traded in the bench- mark No 129 bond against an average volume of Y1,000bn. Meanwhile, overnight unse- cured call-money rates have stabilised at about 7 per cent, after dipping below this level earlier in the week. Specula- tion continues that the Bank of Japan will cut the official dis- count rate over the next few weeks, possibly in conjunction with the US Federal Reserve. SIN THE US, bond prices eased slightly across the board as the lack of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve con- tinued to depress sentiment and prices. In late trading, the bench- mark 30-year Treasury bond was down i at 101, yielding 8.011 per cent. The two-year note was also down A at 100A, yielding 6.203 per cent. Prices were firmer in New York at the opening on rumours that the Fed would cut the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5 per cent before 9.30am local time, but when the deadline passed, par- ticipants began to trim their long positions. a UK GOVERNMENT bonds ended the day barely changed ahead of the release of unem- ployment figures today and of the retail price index on Fri- day. Early gains were wiped out as sterling weakened slightly against the D-Mark, leaving short-dated gilts unchanged and long-dated stock margin- ally firmer. * SPAIN and Italy, two of the high-yielding European govern- ment bond markets, continue to attract strong buying inter- east. Spanish bonds have rallied In recent days on speculation that the Bank of Spain is to cut the intervention rate, currently at 12.6 per cent. The yield on the 12% per cent bond, due March 2000, opened at 11.49 per cent and closed at 11.46 per cent. Last Wednesday, the yield stood at 11.58 per cent. Italy has attracted foreign investors recently on hopes that the withholding tax situa- tion would be resolved soon. *THE French and German government bond markets drifted lower.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown In Sydney DAIWA Securities, one of the big four Japanese securities houses, yesterday said it had been granted corporate mem- bership of the. Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It is the first Japanese investment bank to become a member of the ASX, but grow- ing Japanese interest in Aus- trallan stocks is expected to lead to applications from other securities houses. \"This decision was taken after strong investor interest in the Australian markets,\" said Mr Masarn Aral, manag- ing director of Daiwa Securi- ties Stockbroking, the group's Australian arm. He added that the decision was \"a significant vote of confidence\" in the Aus- tralian stock market. Daiwa executives said the timing of its application reflected its belief that Austra- ha was emerging from reces- sion and was likely to lead the world's other recession-hit economies into recovery. \"Our view is that the market has bottomed. We have had three relatively tough years in Australia, but we think the economy is through the cycle, and now is the time to get serious about the Australian market again,\" said Mr John Beggs, a director of Daiwa's Australian subsidiary. Daiwa has been dealing in Australian stocks on behalf of Japanese customers for some time, using local brokers to execute trades. The group will employ 12 staff in Australia. The bank's presence in the ASI will increase competition in the Australian broking industry, which has struggled to remain profitable since the 1987 global stock markets crash. However, the group said it expected an increase in Japa- nese investment as the econ- omy recovered, and hoped to build an Australian client list on the back of its core Japa- nese business. Daiwa established a repre- sentative arm in Sydney in 1980, but stepped up its Aus- tralian involvement with the acquisition of 100 per cent of its joint venture with ANZ Bank,Daiwa ANZ Interna- tional in 1989.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London NATIONAL Westminster Bank, the UK's second largest clearer, has followed Tuesday's Â£140m sterling preference share sale with a debut issue of US preference shares. The $200m deal, lead-man- aged by Merrill Lynch, will be the bank's first core capital denominated in dollars and will be used to finance the cap- italisation of NatWest's US subsidiary. In June last year, the bank filed a shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission which allowed for the issue of up to $500m perpetual preference shares. This is the first issue under that registration. The shares will be priced next week, following pre-mar- keting. Most US preference shares are sold to retail inves- tors via an investment bank with a large sales force. Although this is National Westminster's first dollar pref- erence share issue, other UK banks have been more active. This year, Barclays Bank made its fourth issue since 1989, a $200m deal lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, bringing its dollar-denominated preference share capital to nearly $lbn. The last Barclays issue pays a dividend of 11/2 per cent, but trades at a premium to face value. NatWest may have to pay slightly more because it is new to the market and has a marginally lower credit rating. Sterling preference shares must be irredeemable, but the dollar equivalent can be called by the bank at any time after five years, if the Bank of England approves. However, the issue still counts as Tier I capital under the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy, and boosts the bank's capacity to lend in the US.",

   "text_content" : "By Sim on London TRADING was dominated by small issues aimed at specific pockets of demand yesterday as issuers and investors held back ahead of US inflation data due for release today. Woolwich Building Society followed its Â£100m senior debt issue last week with a Â£75m 10-year subordinated deal, which will count as non-core capital. The deal, lead-managed by Baring Brothers, carries a 11% per cent coupon and was priced to yield 156 basis points more than the 10 per cent UK government bond maturing 2001. The high yield of the issue attracted demand from UK institutional investors. Participants in the deal found a hunger for higher cou- pon paper following the impressive rally by UK govern- ment bonds during the sum. mer. For example, the 10-year benchmark gilt was yesterday yielding around 9.67 per cent, against 10.83 per cent at the end of June. Some of these institutional buyers may have bought National Westminster Bank's Â£140m preference share issue issued late on Tuesday at a yield spread of 250 basis points over gilts. This issue, lead- managed by Salomon Brothers, was reported fully-placed yes- terday. However, buying of such subordinated capital remains a INTERNATIONAL BONDS niche business in the UK. Syn- dicate managers are not expecting a flood of subordi- nated debt or preference share issues by UK financial institu- tions. Canada Trustco, a mortgage lender, came with a tightly- priced C$100m five-year deal lead managed by Scotia- McLeod. The bonds carry a coupon of 10% per cent and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.175, where the yield spread over Canadian government bonds is 75 basis points. The deal was supported by retail demand from continental Europe, although intermedi- aries reported unexpected demand from elsewhere. The yield spread held at 75 basis points throughout the day. State Bank of South Austra- lia launched the first Austra- lian dollar issue since the first week of August, a A$100m five- year deal lead-managed by Hambros. The bonds carry an 11 per cent coupon and the deal was priced at 101.10. At a discount equivalent to full fees, the paper yields 11.25 per cent. In the Eurolira sector, the European Investment Bank added a fungible L400bn to its outstanding L600bn 11.10 per cent issue maturing 2001. The fungible tranche, bought largely by Italian investors who enjoy tax concessions on holdings of EIB paper, creates the first L1,000bn Eurolire bond.",

   "text_content" : "Sucralose, Tate & Lyle's calorie-free sweetener, was approved for use in Canada yesterday - its first licence by a national regu- latory authority - after 15 years of development at a cost of more than Â£150m. Sucralose is an important ingredient in the commercial future of Tate & Lyle, which is seeking to diversify away from its traditional dependence on refined sugar. Analysts say that if sucralose is approved as expected in the US, Europe and Japan, the UK company and its US partner, Johnson & John- son, are likely to be selling hundreds of millions of dollars a year worth of the sweetener in the late 1990s; sucralose would then add at least Â£20m a year to Tate & Lyle's profits. From the consumer's point of view, sucralose is claimed to have several advantages over the intense sweeteners most commonly used today: saccha- rin, a non-proprietary sweet- ener in use for more than 80 years; Monsanto's aspartame, trade name NutraSweet; and Hoechst's acesulfame-K, trade name Sunett. 0 It is 600 times sweeter than sugar. The others are 200 to 300 times sweeter. * Its flavour is more sugar- like than saccharin (whose bit- ter after-taste is notorious) and acesulfame-K. Whether the sucralose flavour is closer to sugar than aspartame is a mat- ter of considerable debate in food industry tasting panels. 0 It is a heat-stable molecule and can be used for baking and cooking, unlike aspartame which does not survive sus- tained heating. - It is also more resistant to chemical attack than aspar- tame and is therefore poten- tially more suitable for sweet- ening acidic drinks which need to have a long shelf life. Sucralose was first made in 1976, in a collaborative research programme between Tate & Lyle and Queen Eliza- beth College, London. The intention was to intensify the natural sweetness of sucrose (ordinary sugar) by making small chemical changes. Sugar is converted to sucra- lose in a patented process which replaces three of the eight hydroxyl (OH) groups in the sucrose molecule by chlo- rine atoms. All other high-intensity sweeteners, on the other hand, are chemically quite different from sugar. For example aspar- tame consists of two amino acids (protein units). Scientists do not yet have a coherent the- ory of flavour to explain - or predict - why some molecules fit so well into receptors on the taste buds in the mouth and produce a \"sweet\" sensation. In 1979 Tate & Lyle formed a joint venture with Johnson & Johnson, the US healthcare and consumer products giant, to develop and eventually man- ufacture and market sucralose. The long period since then reflects the extensive safety testing required to licence a ThÂ·E De7L IS ~iENOh4E 114E COFPEISXbECA9~ WICI4c~ IS-rI4Ar FkoRy new food additive. The regulatory dossier sub- mitted to the Canadian author- ities contained 22,000 pages, giving the results of 100 sepa- rate safety studies and 40 envi- ronmental studies. Tate & Lyle says that none suggested that sucralose consumption could cause any ill effects. Peter Eatherley, managing director of Tate & Lyle Special- ity Sweeteners, says it takes even longer to obtain regula- tory approval for a novel food than for a pharmaceutical. \"There can be no compromise with a food ingredient; it has to be absolutely safe, with no side effects at all.\" Sucralose is completely non-fattening and does not promote tooth decay. It passes through the body without being digested. Tate & Lyle expects to sell sucralose to all sectors of the food and drinks industry, as a substitute for sugar or other artificial sweeteners. Soft drinks are likely to be the larg- est market. Although sucralose can with- stand cooking, it cannot replace sugar directly in cakes and biscuits where the bulk of the sugar is an essential part of the baking process. Then an additional \"bulking agent\" is required too. The main target of Tate & Lyle's marketing department will be aspartame (Nutra- Sweet), the sweetener market leader, which is an ingredient in 4,800 products worldwide. Acesulfame-K (Sunett) lags well behind aspartame though its sales are growing fast. Roy Miller, Hoechst UK marketing manager, concedes that Sunett on its own does not taste as much like sugar as aspartame or sucralose. But, he says, \"the best taste is achieved by using a mixture of sweeteners\". When sweeteners are used In combination, their flavours reinforce one another in a \"synergistic\" effect. Several other intense sweet- eners are being developed in academic and industrial labo- ratories around the world. Monsanto's NutraSweet divi- sion, for example, has an ambi- tious collaborative programme with Universit6 Claude Bern- ard in Lyon, France, to develop new sweeteners based on amino acids. \"These compounds have the advantage of possessing intense sweetening power unparalleled among the cur- rently commercialised com- pounds,\" said Professor Jean- Marie Tinti of Universitd Claude Bernard. \"They have in effect a sweetening power which is several thousand times higher than sucrose.\" With the technical and com- mercial power of Monsanto behind it, the NutraSweet replacement programme stands an excellent chance of success. But sucralose is unlikely to face many other competitors in the near future. As Peter Eath- erley of Tate & Lyle says, \"the entry costs in this business are extremely high\". Developing a new sweetener for the world market today could cost more than Â£200m, putting it beyond the reach of any but the largest companies. So sweet-toothed slimmers are unlikely ever to be able to choose from an extensive selec- tion of sugar substitutes.",

   "text_content" : "S un Microsystems has thrown down the gaunt- let. With the introduction last week of a new computer operating system that will run not only on its Sparc workstat- ions but also on personal com- puters, Sun has launched a new offensive in the battle to establish computer software standards. A leader in the market for computer workstations based upon Rise (Reduced Instruc- tion Set Computing) micropro- cessors, Sun now aims to extend its influence into the far bigger PC sector where Intel's microprocessors and Microsoft's operating systems software reign supreme. It was in the PC market of the 1980s that the value of standards emerged. Because all PC makers (except Apple Computer) used the same Intel processors and Microsoft oper- ating system, an array of application programs quickly developed, stimulating com- puter sales. Computer buyers came to appreciate the advantages of standards through competitive pricing for both hardware and software. This spawned demands for \"open systems\" or standards spanning a much broader spectrum of computer types, centred upon various derivatives of AT&T's Unix operating system. Ironically, the standards that have so far emerged in the rest of the computer mar- ket are not compatible with the vast installed base of about 80m PCs. With \"Solaris\", its Unix-based oper- ating system, Sun aims to merge the PC world with the \"open systems\" one, and in so doing greatly expand the terri- tory in which it competes. Sun is not alone in recognis- ing the opportunities offered by an operating system that bridges the PC/workstation divide. Microsoft is developing a Windows New Technology that will run on computers built around both Intel chips and Risc processors designed by Mips Computer. Windows NT should be available by the middle of 1992 and has been endorsed by the \"Ace\" consortium - a group of more than 80 computer and software companies led by Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment and Microsoft. IBM and Apple have also outlined an agreement to develop software to run both on IBM's Rise workstations and on Apple's next genera tion of PCs. Sun has been notably absent from these recent alliances. As last week's software announce- ment demonstrates, however, the workstation leader is mov- ing in a similanr direction. These struggles to establish a new operating system stan- dard signal a shift in the role of the PC. Most PC users do not need all the features of today's complex operating systems, nor the fire power of an Intel 486 processor or Risc- based computer on their desks. But when the PC is linked to a network the picture changes. About 20m PCs are connected to networks and the number is expected to double over the next 12 months. Today's desktop PCs are being transformed into power- ful terminals that can get access to and process vast quantities of data. The more personal \"O'C of the 1990s is the carry-along notebook or pocket-sized computer with more limited functions. In this newly defined desk- top computing market, Sun will compete directly with the giants of the PC market - IBM, Compaq Computer and Apple as well as other work- station manufacturers such as Digital Equipment and Hew- lett-Packard. To succeed in creating a new software standard, however, Sun must first unseat Micro- soft, the entrenched PC soft- ware leader. The failure of Microsoft's efforts to popular- ise OS/2, a PC operating sys tem developed by Microsoft and IBM, demonstrates Just how difficult it is to persuade PC sers to switch to a new operating system, even if it is compatible with eristing appli- cations programs. Microsoft and IBM, long allies in the PC market, have parted ways on how to proceed from here. Microsoft is posi- tioning its \"Windows New Technology\" as an extension of the highly successful Win- dows graphical user interface. IBM is pursuing development of OS/2, despite disappointing sales of current versions of the operating system. In the longer term, IBM and Apple aim to leapfrog the cur- rent software squabbles to cre- ate a new operating system that will draw together Apple's Macintosh PCs and IBM PCs and workstations. In the meantime, the standards that enabled the PC industry to flourish in the 1980s are quickly disintegrating. Louise Kehoe",

   "text_content" : "By Charles Brower he United Nations effort to process legal claims against Iraq for the dam- ages caused by its invasion of Kuwait has begun in earnest. At its first session in Geneva concluded last month the gov- erning council of the UN Com- pensation Commission, which is handling such claims as part of the Gulf war ceasefire last April, adopted a plan to pro- vide expedited compensation to certain individuals. Eligible are claims of up to $100,000 each for personal inJu- ries, including, potentially, \"mental pain and anguish\", as well as death, and \"losses of income, support, housing or personal property, or medical expenses or costs of departure\" from Iraq or Kuwait. On August 15, the UN Secu- rity Council concurred in the secretary-general's recommen- dation, given on May 30, that the \"compensation to be paid by Iraq\" into the UN Compen- sation Fund for distribution to claimants by the Commission should be \"30 per cent of the annual value\" of Iraq's oil exports - about 6.bn. At the same time, the Secu- rity Council authorised the first post-invasion sale of Iraqi oil, a $1.6bn transaction to pro- vide \"foodstuffs, medicines\" and the like. This will provide a first tranche of $480m to start paying the expedited claims. These actions are backed up by deadlines and a work sched- ule designed to keep the pro- cess moving. The $1.6bn oil sale authorisation specifies that within no more than 20 days the secretary-general must present a plan ot imple- mentation to the Security Council for its approval. Governments are expressly \"encouraed\" by the Commis- sion to submit the expedited claims of their nationals within six months after the Commisslon's newly-appolnted executive secretary has pre- paed the claas arm, which should be completed by the end of October. The Implica- tion thereafter is that such claims will be pid oa a \"first come, si served\" bes. In moving with caPmartive swiftness ad erctihmss the UN iealy h benefted from the bet that INaq Meetin y must ept what is inamod on it as a d ated warrior, utDke Iran whbn it mgoisam with the US to \"edlish the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in resolving the stalemate over US diplomatic hostages. But the Commission has shown a felicitous disposition to apply the lessons of Amer- ica's 10-year experience with Iran at the Tribunal. Most striking is its early focus on individual claimants, whose losses, though often small in absolute terms, can be devastating, especially if not quickly made good. Although the Iran-US Claims Tribunal established a separate category for claims of less than $250,000, mostly representing individual losses, they were largely ignored, to the benefit of the claims of big businesses and the two governments, even though they accounted for about 75 per cent of cases filed with the Tribunal. For example, of 1,500 claims made by individuals asserting that they were \"wrongfully expelled\" from Iran, with con- sequent loss of property and livelihood, only six were ever decided, and only one of the six resulted in any payment. Nine years after the Tribunal was established a lump-sum settlement of such claims was reached by the two govern- ments, and only now, nearly 13 years after the claimants left Iran, are they being processed by the US Foreign Claims Set- tlement Commission. By contrast, the UN Compen- sation Commission's August Z decision grants $2,500 outright to anyone on simple proof \"f the fact and date of departure from Iraq or Kuwait\" between August 2 1990 and March 2 1991, or of \"serious persona. injury\" or the death of a spouse, child or parent. Such relief is cumulative, subjlect to a per family limit of 5M,000 in case ofddepUture a $10,000 for a death.

Such laims may lancl d uslBeus oame\" Idelatd to departure (but not, at least at this time, any \"suffered as a result of the trade embargo and related measures\") as well as \"mental pain and anguish\" all within guidelines to be established. In beginning to define what constitutes a compensatable \"direct loss\" resulting from Iraq's invasion the Commis- sion also has learned from the Iran-US experience. For example, along with the obvious causes of such dam- ages, such as \"military operations\", actions of Iraqi government officials or entities \"in connection with the inva- sion or occupation\", and \"hos- tage-taking or other illegal detention\", the Commission has listed \"the breakdown of civil order in Kuwait or Iraq\". It thereby has eliminated the arguments, frequently aired at the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, over whether harm to a claim- ant was caused by a \"popular movement\" or other non-gov- ernmental entity and therefore is not compensatable. By indicating, too, that employers who repatriated their employees from Iraq or Kuwait may later claim their costs, the Commission has avoided another anomaly of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, which usually found such pay- ments by employers not to be within its jurisdiction. The Commission also has tackled head on an issue that looked as though it would split the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, namely whether penaI hav- ing Iraqi nationality as well as another may file an intorna- tional claim agenst Iaq. In the case of Iran a mority of the Tribunal ultimately decided that an Iranian-Amei- can dual national could eek damages from Iran only if he proved that his IS tiSamhip, juged by a hbat of pratical criteria, was the \"dominant and eOetve\" one. Even that decmla, however, pgoroted a ituperatve deca- ratio by the I ilda mubr of the Tribunal, who then mt1Bud for yeam to coa lW mo cam, which have bma to be heard only in the t ym or two Bo ntrat, the tria has flatly ruId that rÂ¶ umhy hm ba MIe anlcair r~y kucpadwerof wah i~Cht zenship is the dominant and effective one. The Commission also has dared to break entirely new ground in this area, by taking steps to ensure that injured parties may be able to claim even if stateless or otherwise unrepresented, despite the fact that in principle the Commis- sion will accept only \"consoli- dated\" claims presented by governments on behalf of their nationals, who will depend on their government to distribute to them any damages awarded. Thus, a government may \"also submit the claims of other persons resident in its territory\". This opens the way to Kuwait, for example, should it chose to do so, to present the claims of Palestinians or others who have long resided there. As a last resort, the govern- ing council of the Commission has empowered itself to \"request an appropriate per- son, authority or body to sub- mit claims on behalf of persons who are not in a position to have their claims submitted by a government\". Notwithstanding this good beginning many weighty deci- sions still await the Commis- sion and a number of potential claimants continue to face uncertainty. The all important determination of the precise outer limits of what is a comn- pensatable \"direct loss\" remains to be made. Corporate claimants, and governments, which are excluded from these first expe- dited claims procedures, await news as to when and how their demands will be heard.

   "text_content" : "By Michael Skapinker Television sets are acquir- ing so many new sea- tures that there will soon be no space on the remote control handset to fit them all. This will be disturbing news to. the many people who already have three remote con- trols - one for the television, one for the video cassette recorder and one for the satel- lite receiver - and don't know how to use any of them. Nokia, the Finnish electron- ics company, claims to have the solution. It is called the TV mouse and was launched at the Berlin- consumer electronics fair late last month. Instead of pressing buttons to change channels, the vol- ume or the colour, the mouse lets you tell the TV what to do with a flick of the wrist. The television mouse has a button at the centre to control all TV functions. The volume is increased by pressing the button and rotating the wrist to the right. Rotating the wrist to the left, as one would with a volume control knob, turns the sound down. Pointing the mouse up or down changes channels - a movement which appears to take time to master. Another button on the hand- set, marked Menu, brings up a table of available channels. Pointing the mouse upwards or downwards, to the left or right, gives you an alternative way of choosing the channel you want. This movement also requires practice. The TV mouse provides simi- lar control over the VCR and satellite receiver. It is not nec- essary to have separate remote controls - as long as you buy all three machines from Nokia. Pressing the VCR button and turning the handset to the left rewinds the tape, to the right it switches to fast forward. Hold it up and you get a still pic- ture. A disadvantage of the TV mouse is that it cannot be used to pre-programme the video cassette recorder. The TV mouse relies on gravity to make the changes you want it to make. A small ball bearing, housed in the body of the handset, rolls as you tilt it, moving it into one of five positions - left, right, up, down or straight. In each position, the ball blocks light generated by an infra-red diode and three photo transistors, triggering the change desired. The mouse will be available from the end of this year with all newly introduced Nokia ste- reo TV sets. It will add Â£30 to the price of the equipment. Despite its vaunted ease of use, the TV mouse is still crowded. In addition to the buttons which allow you to control your set by moving your wrist, Nokia has put most of the old controls on as well. \"The reluctance of the con- sumer to change is extremely high,\" says Jacques Noels, president of Nokia Consumer Electronics. \"You don't need the other keys, but we put them on so that the customer doesn't feel lost.\" i: Â·'Â·Â·Â·Â·'iÂ·-':Â·; :'':':'i Â·;Â·;;",

   "text_content" : "By Anthony Robinson and Kenneth Gooding GOLD'S PRICE fell to the lowest level for five years in London yesterday after a wave of Middle East selling shook a market becoming increasingly nervous about the implications of the gradual break-up of the Soviet Union, the world's third- largest producer of the pre- cious metal. At the afternoon formal price fixing session in London, gold ended at US$345.25 a troy ounce, down $5.35 on the over- night level. The price fell fur- ther, to $343, before recovering to close in London at $345.25 an ounce. Apprehension in the market increased on Tuesday after Mr Eduard Gostev, deputy head of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs (Vneshekonombank), warned that wildcat gold sales by the increasingly autono- mous republics could damage gold's prospects. He said: \"Hasty and unco-ordinated activities can very easily spoil the gold market and lead to a fall in prices\". Yesterday's Middle East sales, rumoured to be by the same syndicate, operating through the National Commer- cial Bank of Jeddah, that has hit the market on other occa- sions, quickly triggered copy- cat selling. Traders suggest it took very little volume to set off the fall. \"What was slightly disappoint- ing,\" said Mr Andy Smith, ana- lyst at the Union Bank of Swit- zerland, \"was the absence of bargain hunters. They usually move in at this level. The mar- ket seems to have taken Mr Gostev's comments very badly.\" A London dealer said: \"The move down was incredible. We didn't see a buyer for hours\". Sentiment in London was not improved by a report in yesterday's Guardian newspa- per that nearly llm ounces of gold worth $4bn had been secretly moved out of the Soviet Union this year in an unofficial \"gold drain\". Traders treated this with extreme scepticism and Mr Alexander Voytenkov, first deputy head of Gosbank's hard currency department, dis- missed the report saying: \"This is gibberish. Soviet gold cannot be secretly exported from the country. That issue does not even merit comment\". However, the market contin- ues to worry about large quan- tities of gold, perhaps as much as 250 tonnes (8m ounces), in western banks as collateral for loans. Much of this metal has been swapped (sold but with an agreement to buy back at a later date). The Soviets are highly expe- rienced in gold swaps but the banks have been insisting on increasingly tough conditions and charging more to roll-over loans. There is considerable concern that, without western financial help, Soviet central gold authorities may not be Able to redeem swaps when they fall due and may also be forced to re-negotiate $62bn of foreign debt.",

   "text_content" : "By John Murray Brown in Ankara TURKEY IS considering an investment proposal from a Swiss company to build a gold refinery in Istanbul, in the lat- est effort to liberalise the coun- try's gold market. Pamp, a Geneva-based com- pany run by a Lebanese of Turkish origin, has submitted an application to the Turkish central Bank to refine gold scrap with the longer-term prospect of producing gold bars for export. This follows the fur- ther easing of foreign exchange controls in June, allowing for the export of unfabricated gold. Local traders say that Pamp is keen to bring in the Istanbul stock exchange as a partner, with the prospect of developing a paper-based market in gold. The investment, if it is given official approval, is likely to lead to a clearer picture emerg- ing of Turkey's gold trading, which has expanded rapidly since the opening of an official gold market in April 1989. Last year, the Central Bank imported, on a consignment basis, 144 tonnes of gold. The bank sells to two banks and to 26 approved exchange dealers at the official international price plus freight and insur- ance charges. The sharp growth in jewel- lery fabrication, an industry that now employs 100,000 peo- ple in more than 4,000 retail outlets, absorbs the large bulk of gold imports. Turkey's Republic coins also account for about 10 per cent of gold usage. \"But clearly the local market alone cannot absorb that sort of volume,\" said one trader underlining what even officials concede is the significant level of smuggling. Industry officials estimate that as much as 45 tonnes may have been smuggled out of the country in the form of kilo- gram bars to Balkan countries and the Middle East, particu- larly Iran. Mr Marwan Shakarchi, Pamp's chairman, says he was attracted by Turkey's cheap labour and the large local sup- ply of gold scrap. The refiner- y's capacity, he says, depends on whether the government also liberalises gold imports, which are currently the monopoly of the Central Bank. According to Gold Fields Mineral Services, the Middle East accounts for about 30 per cent of the world's supply of gold scrap. Mr Shakarchi says that Turkey recycles between 20 and 25 tonnes every year as consumers trade in their gold jewellery, particularly at times when prices are high.",

In its first estimates for 1991-92, Man puts production at 113.6m tonnes and consumption at 111.5m tonnes, leaving a surplus of 2.1m tonnes. Last month Czarnikow., another leading London trade house, predicted a deficit next season, with production at 113m tonnes and consumption sharply ahead at 113.14m tonnes. Man's production estimate is roughly level with this season; it expects beet production to fall by 2.1m tonnes and cane to increase by the same amount to 74.1m tonnes. \"Meanwhile our consumption estimate, although increasing steadily, has been rising at a slower pace than the rate of produc- tion growth,\" says Man's latest sugar market report. Man points out that the potential increase in stocks in several countries and the pres- sure to offload surplus sugar on to the market is depressing for prices. It cites the possible build up of sugar in Cuba, whose arrangements with the Soviet Union look precarious, as well as in India, Turkey and Hungary - all \"potential sources of extra unseasonal supplies in the coming months\". On the upside, Man says that the unprecedented changes going on in the sugar market should enhance speculative interest and price volatility.",

Raw sugar futures in New York were higher at midday on news that the Soviet Union had requested 900,000 tonnes of sugar from the European Community under an aid package. Traders said the news was bullish because it could remove that much sugar from what is viewed as a well supplied market. But they were quick to add that it also demonstrates the Soviet Union is still not active on the open cash market and further offtake remains in question.

   "text_content" : "HE AREQUIPA area of southern Peru should be an agro-industrial para- dise. The climate and soil are perfect for year-round cultiva- tion of fruit and vegetable export crops, on which, say experts, an agro-industrial boom far bigger than Chile's could be solidly based. Near Arequipa is a huge area apparently ideal for such expansion - the 57,000-hectare (140,000-acre) Majes plain, irri- gated by an elaborate system of canals and tunnels that diverts water from the snowy heights of the Andes. Although fewer than 8,000 hectares are as yet in full production, exper- imental programmes have proved conditions are perfect for year-round high quality export crops ranging from mel- ons to asparagus, tomatoes to grapes. But the potential of Majes has been sacrificed on the altar of an outdated agricultural policy, Much of this prime land, divided into individually- farmed five-hectare plots and virtually given away to land- less peasants, is currently under alfalfa - an undemand- ing crop with a guaranteed local market with the dairy cattle that supply Leche Glo- ria, Peru's leading evaporated milk processing plant. Critics say Majes is the most expen- sive pasture-land in the world. Twenty-year-old land tenure restrictions, imposed by the Velasco military regime's agrarian reform which broke up Peru's vast traditional haci- endas on the coast, have proved an insuperable stumb- ling block to agricultural devel- opment and efficiency. Now all that has, apparently, changed. In early August Presi- dent Alberto Fujimori, himself an agronomist by training and former head of Lima's presti- gious Agrarian University of La Molina, decreed a new law to promote investment in the agricultural centre. \"We want to make the coun- tryside the vital centre-stage of the economy,\" the president told peasant farmers. \"This new law will allow producers to mortgage their land and \"We want to make the countryside the vital centre-stage of the economy . . . This new law will allow producers to mortgage their land and thus gain direct access to credit\" thus gain direct access to credit.\" Reversing the provisions of the Velasco law that land could be owned only by those who directly worked it, the Fujimori decree establishes land as a freely tradeable com- modity. It may now be leased and tenanted. Permissible land-owning limits are raised to 250 hectares for irrigated coastal land with agro-indus- trial projects qualifying for 450 hectares. Development classi- fied by the Ministry of Agricul- ture as \"special and in the national or regional interest\" could be granted up to 1,000 hectares. Foreigners will enjoy identical investment condi- tions to Peruvian nationals, while licensing and red tape for land titling have been cut to a minimum. The new law, promulgated under special powers delegated by congress, met with some political opposition from Peru's left wing but has been gener- ally welcomed by farmers, potential investors and techni- cal experts. Yet it seems unlikely to pro- voke an immediate flurry of investment. Mr Cesar Granda, head of the agro-industrial committee of the Peruvian exporters' association Adex, could find no fault with the new law's basic provisions - \"it's truly exquisite, completely liberal\", he commented. \"But for all Peru's advantages, agro- industry is not profitable. Those of us already exporting are deep in an underground tunnel - and while what we really need is a cup of hot cos- fee they are giving us cherry brandy.\" Like all other Peruvian exports, agricultural and agro-industrial products have been hit badly in the past year by an overvalued local currency. Exporters reckon a realistic exchange rate would earn them two and a half times the current return. Simulta- neously they face crippling interest rates (24 per cent a year on loans in dollars and 20 per cent a month in sols, even with monthly inflation in sin- gle figures) and the highest power and fuel costs on the Latin American continent. They have also, under Fuji- mori's austerity programme, lost a generous tax rebate scheme and government-subsi- dised pre-export financing. \"We're not asking for hand- outs,\" says Mr Granda, \"but we must have access to financing at internationally competitive rates.\" While exchange rate prob- lems seem to have temporarily dampened the enthusiasm of some big Peruvian manufactur- ers for agro-industrial invest- ment, the new economic real- ism pervading Peru at all levels is encouraging unex- pected changes of attitude in small farmers. With the central reserve bank now refusing to print money to finance agricul- tural credit, the state agrarian bank is to all intents and pur- poses closed for business. Larger farmers with a good track record can cover working capital requirements with loans from the commercial banks, albeit at high interest rates, but the source of credit for small farmers has dried up completely. \"We can no longer look to the state for help,\" says Mr Luis Zuniga, president of the FAA, Arequipa's association of small agriculturalists. \"But we know, in the current domestic recession, that we must change from producing onions, garlic and rice towards export-ori- ented crops. We think that forming limited companies is the best way forward.\" The FAA is already well advanced in negotiations with a variety of potential partners in the US, Japan and Switzer- land to finance the installation of up to four tomato concen- trate plants in the Majes area Each would cost upwards of US$Sm. The processing goal of 400 tonnes of raw material daily, year round, demands a production area of about 2,000 hectares, possible - even under the new land law - only through an association of growers. Even though local farmers must now pay going market rates for the Majes land (in the August auction a five-hectare plot cost about US$44,000 with the buyer needing to find another US$15,000 for second- ary irrigation work) there is a long queue of prospective purchasers. \"We all realise that agro- industry is the only way for- ward. We've got better growing conditions than Chile and everyone here wants to be a small landowner,\" says Mr Zuniga. Staying small has other advantages in Peru - you are less of a target for the terrorist groups who in the past few months have turned their vio- lent attention to coastal agri- culture. Recent victims include several Peruvian landowners and three visiting Japanese agronomists. Both foreign involvement and technological advance are vehemently opposed by Shining Path, the fundamentalist Maoist guer- rilla group. \"If we can't achieve peace and security, then changes in the land-holding laws are use- less and foreign investors won't come to Peru,\" says Mr Granda. \"It's fine to risk your money - but not your life.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Victoria Griffith in Sao Paulo BRAZIL'S soyabean crop has fallen by 26.84 per cent this year to 14.5m tonnes, according to an estimate released this week by the government's statistical agency, the IBGE. The agency says that the decline resulted from a pro- longed drought in the south of the country and scarcity of agricultural credit, which led farmers to switch to crops like maize that require less fertilis- ers and pesticides, and so are cheaper to grow. Cocoa production also sus- fered a 3.5 per cent decline, dipping to 348,600 tonnes, according to the agency's esti- mates. Initial estimates for the wheat crop predict a 32.26 per cent rise from last year, which was the worst on record, to 2.5m tonnes. \"Good weather and improved planting technol- ogy mean Brazil will produce more wheat this year than ini- tially expected,\" said Mr Celso Matsuda, national secretary for agricultural policy. \"This should reduce wheat imports substantially. The gov- ernment initially expected to take in 4m tonnes. It has already bought 2m tonnes, and probably won't import any more.\" Favourable weather condi- tions also resulted in rises in the production of rice, beans, and cotton. Coffee production is estimated to be up by 4.74 per cent. Maize production will rise by 10.18 per cent in the first har- vest and by 48,88 per cent in the second, according to the IBGE, which attributes the increase chiefly to crop substi- tution. * Farmers in Brazil are worried about a drought in the key coffee growing regions in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. Producers fear that the lack of rain may seriously affect the plants.",

   "text_content" : "I By Arlane Genillard recently in Baku, Azerbaijan AZERBAIJAN'S recently- declared independence will boost the republic's effort to develop its oil business. Reserves are thought to be as rich as some Gulf states. \"We need to undertake a rad- ical modernisation of this sec- tor of the economy and we are fully aware that we will need foreign capital to do so,\" said Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov. Azerbaijan, which was the first place in the Soviet Union to lift oil in the 19th century, produced 12.5m tonnes of oil in 1990 of which 9.5m came from its offshore operations in the Caspian Sea. Western businessmen in Baku, the capital, estimate, however, that the Caspian Sea's oil reserves may be very significant. Azerbaijan's oil production particularly increased in the early 1980s with the discovery of a large oil field in the Cas- pian Sea. The 28th of April oil field, which produces 6m tonnes of oil a year, accounts for two thirds of the offshore production. Drilling depths there reach 4,500m. Last June Amoco, the US oil corporation, won the first for- eign contract to exploit Azeri, a large oilfield in the continen- tal shelf of the Caspian Sea. British Petroleum, and Unocal of American had also shown an interest in the venture. The Azeri oilfield's reserves may be over 200m tonnes, according to Mr Seyad Ibrahi- mov, deputy director of Cas- morneftegazprom, the Azerbai- jani state company in charge of offshore drilling. Mr Ibrahimov added that other oilfields exist in the area but are awaiting proper assessment of potential. Azerbaijan's oil industry has suffered from a chronic lack of research and capital invest- ment in recent decades. West- ern businessmen say its tech- nology dates from as far back as the 1940s. Authorities in the republic say that Azerbaijan's recently declared independence will allow the republic to have a greater say over its oil industry, which until now has been largely under the control of the Federal authorities in Moscow. But the swift break-up of the Soviet Union may prove to turn into a legislative night- mare for foreign investors try- ing to figure out which laws, republican or federal, predomi- nate. SA Hungarian trading com- pany says it has swapped 100,000 tonnes of wheat, 100,000 tonnes of maize, and 50,000 tonnes of sunflowerseed for oil from the autonomous Tatar Republic in the Soviet Union, reports Reuters from Buda- pest. Mr Imre Orban, deputy gen- eral manager of Agrimpex Plc, says that the deal is worth about $25m and that the oil has already been delivered. He believes it is Hungary's first such deal with the Tatar Republic.",

   "text_content" : "FOUR years ago this week, fresh from a general election triumph three months earlier, Mrs Margaret Thatcher began a tour of the UK's most dis- tressed towns and cities and declared the government's aim of winning them over to the Conservatives at the next gen- eral election. She started on Teesside. The new Teesside Develop- ment Corporation (TDC), a quango created by Mr Nicholas Ridley, then environment sec- retary, to regenerate the local economy, was less than a fort- night old, but it was the only secure bubble from which she could view one of the bleaker parts of industrial Britain without trucking with hostile local authorities. Teesside's county council and four district councils remain solidly Labour. A sub- region of north-east England, it has long been one of the worst examples of a dependent, branch economy, built around a few large employers owned and run from afar - and there- fore especially vulnerable to national and international eco- nomic cycles. Chemicals, shipbuilding, heavy engineering and steel were Teesside's raison d'etre. The recession of 10 years ago, coupled with industry's gen- eral drive to reduce unit costs, destroyed shipbuilding and wiped out thousands of jobs in the other three industries. When Mrs Thatcher turned up, nearly 50,000 Teesside people were jobless. Among men in Middlesbrough's travel-to- work-area the rate was more than one in four. Mr Ron Norman and Mr Duncan Hall, respectively the corporation's chairman and chief executive, took Mr Ridley and the Prime Minister to be photographed in a derelict, weed-infested urban wilderness on the banks of the Tees in the middle of the 550,000-popula- tion conurbation. Politically, it was probably a mistake. Teesside's statistics today show why the picture was risky. Male unemployment in Middlesbrough travel-to- work-area was 20.3 per cent in July, the latest figure avail- able. The overall unemploy- ment rate for men and women living in Cleveland county - which comprises much of what is considered to be Teesside - was 13.9 per cent. These figures suggest failure and they will probably get worse before the next election. ,onngorwr ~gÂ· OVV rm Rnn rÂ·n Â·r r#am#wgn, HÂ·rm~ Â· nmrm ~r#n~m rmo~ (III~R Â·R 1IIIIIIPIII~ Meanwhile, the notorious dere- lict site is not yet teeming with new homes, jobs and opportu- nities, although work is under way. Out of context, however, iso lated unemployment figures do not show the changes going on on Teesside. It is not just what is being done, but how, for Teesside is a team today, where four years ago it was a babble of discordant voices all trying to have the last word, apportion blame and obtain subsidies. In effect, the subsidies have come via the TDC. Its planning powers over large swathes of the conurbation transcended boundaries. Everyone quickly realised that fighting for turf was likely to prove sterile. The local authorities have a monitoring committee to keep a sceptical eye on the corpora- tion, but general acceptance of its catalytic role is widespread, as is respect for the diplomatic skills of Mr Norman, a forger of alliances who subtly bal ances the vigorous salesman- ship of Mr Hall. Mr Norman says: \"In 1987, this was an area of despair. Many people were feeling sorry for themselves. The private sector was buried in shell holes worrying about the problems of the last recession and its aftermath.\" The corporation embarked on an extensive promotional campaign as much to build local confidence as raise aware- ness of the area in Britain and abroad. Mr Norman says it worked. \"Industrialists came out of the woodwork and started taking leases on prop- erty development. The local authorities responded because they saw positive movement. Suddenly we were moving and got momentum because every- one was behind it. \"We were really beginning to motor when the slump hit the south of England. Everything has stopped down there, but our market has held up. Inves- tors are still coming in. It's slow, but several developers have had the guts to keep going,\" he says. Certainly, the recession has not had a uniform local effect, as Mr Tony Ford, head of Bar- clays' business centre on Tees- side, avers: \"I can take you to engineering companies that are now making more, month by month, than at any time in their history, but others are verging on insolvency. \"Nevertheless, there is a smugness at the moment because for the first time in anybody's memory the north-east of England is doing better than London and the south-east and that has done an awful lot for confidence.\" Mr John Kirton, president of Teesside chamber of commerce and managing partner of KPMG Peat Marwick McLin- tock, the accountancy firm, in the area, says that exports are rising and that many compa- nies are maintaining profitabil- ity.\" Mr Keith Varley, who has spent his working life with Jacksons, a leading firm of Teesside solicitors, elaborates: \"Opportunities were not avail- able 10 years ago. What we have seen has been a change from pessimism to a degree of optimism. We are beginning to attract quality people to the area.\" Mr Kirton, who refused pro motion to Peat's in London after finishing a spell in Brus sels, is one of them, citing chal- lenge and opportunity as his reason for moving north. None of this demonstrates why male unemployment in the Middlesbrough travel-to- work-area is still one in five. The trend helps explain things. The figure improved from more than 25 per cent to under 22 per cent in the first year after Mrs Thatcher's visit. Twelve months later, in 1989, it was under 17 per cent. Things marked time for a while, with the rate weakening to 17.5 per cent a year ago as interest rates started to bite, but the plunge back to 20 per cent has only happened this year with the late arrival of the recession from the south in north-east England. This underlines the funda- mental and continuing depen- dence of the sub-region on too few big companies run from afar. The difference now, how- ever, is that Teesside people no longer regard themselves as powerless and unable to help themselves, for without the efforts of the last four years, all agree that things would have been much worse today. The local business base is growing. Mr Peter Crowe, chief executive of the chamber of commerce, reports 1,050 mem- bers now as against 890 only 18 months ago. He says that recession did not really arrive until last January and that \"glimmers of recovery\" were already apparent by the end of the second quarter. Stancliffe & Co, a Middles- brough stockbroker that is part of the Allied Provincial group, is in the first decile of national rankings of pension fund man- agement. Wise Speke, the New- castle-based stockbroker owned by Sturge, has recently strengthened its Teesside office. The local training and enter- prise council seems better sup- ported than most because of wide acceptance of the effects of a lack of both of its func- tions in the past. The local business leader- ship team, which encourages corporate commitment to the community, is also an exem- plar of how such things ought to work. Appropriately, it is called Teesside Tomorrow. The extent to which Teesside can continue to pull together and restructure its local econ- omy will determine whether tomorrow can ever come. But the life of a parliament is not enough. It may take a genera- tion - too long to win Teesside for the Tories and far, far too late to save Mrs Thatcher.",

Under the stimulus of the Development Corporation's massive effort to transform the social environment and boost the economy, private investment is flowing in at an unprecendented rate. Over Â£500 million already committed - much more to come. Work is well under way on major flagship schemes. Like Teesdale where 250 acres of formerly derelict industrial land is now being transformed into a new business world for the North. Like Teesside Park's 1,000,000 square foot shopping and leisure centre where trading has already begun. Like Hartlepool Marina where people are moving into the first houses and boats are moving into the first berths. In the past four years 140 companies have been helped by the Corporation to set up or expand on Teesside. That means 8,000 new jobs and many more indirectly. Confidence in Teesside's success is shown in new major investment by worldwide manufacturing companies - ICI, Enron, Cable & Wireless, Integral Corporation, Sanyo, MTM, Tabuchi, Samsung. Abundant new premises, a ready-and-able workforce, Development Area incentives, excellent road, rail, sea and air links, and the energy and commitment of Teessiders - all are combining to make Teesside one of the fastest growing business centres in the country.

   "text_content" : "TEESSIDE was not always ambivalent about heavy indus- try. Back in the days when Gladstone praised Middles- brough as an \"infant Hercu- les\", the town and its neigh- bours basked in their worldwide reputation as the pioneers of the new Iron Age. Well into this century iron and steel production, heavy engineering, shipbuilding and the chemical industry belched out pollution into the atmo- sphere and the River Tees but they also created that most prized product - work. As recently as 1980, even while Teesside's steel, chemi- cal and petrochemical indus- tries were completing a seven year Â£2bn orgy of investment, it was possible to find decaying hangars where feral cats scav- enged as brawny workmen operated clanking, museum- piece machinery, pausing to raise their numb hands towards single bar electric fires slung overhead. In little more than a decade, the area has undergone pro- found change. Teesside is still an immensely important base for ICI, whose local assets are worth Â£4.5bn, almost half its worldwide total. British Steel, currently transferring work to Teesside as it runs down its Scottish operations, has invested massively in Cleve- land too; its Redcar blast fur- nace is Europe's largest. ICI and British Steel remain the area's biggest private sec- tor employers, but their work- forces have contracted sharply; ICI's current 11,500 payroll was twice as big just before the 1979-82 recession when British Steel employed 20,700 com- pared with 6,000 now. Even so, manufacturing still employs 56,000 people in Cleve- land, around 28 per cent of the workforce, almost 5 per cent more than the British average. The proportion in construction is above average too. And fore- casters in Cleveland County Council's economic develop- ment and planning unit expect employment in manufacturing to increase slightly up to 1996. But the dramatic loss of nearly half Cleveland's manu- facturing and construction jobs in the 10 years from 1975 has shaken local confidence, espe- cially in the blue collar com- munities which have borne the brunt of the cuts. Lord Hanson's predatory interest in ICI, and the group's imminent restructuring, are just the latest reminder to Teessiders that the old days of reliance on a handful of pater- nalistic employers are dead. The future seems to lie in high value products, created by small numbers of skilled staff, rather than bulk chemicals produced by masses of manual workers. Cleveland has suffered less acutely than South East England from the present recession but that is due partly to Teesside's labour market shakeout in 1979-83. The county workforce-based unem- ployment rate, now over 12 per cent, is mainland Britain's sec- ond highest. In the depressed areas where the jobless rate exceeds 20 per cent, there is a resentful feeling of having Local businesses are increasingly run from distant headquarters been used, then deemed sur- plus to requirements. And throughout all sections of the community there is growing concern over the qual- ity of the environment and of jobs, coupled with an indig- nant anxiety that Teesside is vulnerable to being viewed by outsiders as a \"dustbin\" for activities unacceptable else- where. Many of the old industrial landmarks have gone. Ship- building on the Tees has van- ished, along with many venera- ble old engineering concerns whose riverside sites are now empty flatlands, or small estates of \"high tech\" Indus- trial units, bordered by flower- ing shrubs. Teesside remains a major force in engineering with a solid base of small specialist firms and consultancies. But in the large companies the tradi- tion of local, self-made entre- preneurs has mostly been replaced with control by con- glomerates headquartered else- where. The proposed takeover of the Davy Corporation by Trafalgar House, both of which own substantial engineering and construction companies in Teesside, further underlines that trend. Teesside's big three offshore fabrication yards are booming v at present. Together with Press s Offshore on Tyneside, they e have made North East England a one of the industry's world if centres. The sector is currently providing work on Teesside for i. more than 10,000 men. i But here too the trend is V away from local control. Red- , path Offshore is part of the s Trafalgar House group; THC at I Hartlepool is Dutch-owned. And the former Davy Offshore Ms odules yard, set up in the t early 1980s by a group of man- t agers who broke away from V Press Offshore on the Tyne; t has since been sold first to the e Davy Corporation, then to Wimpey's SLP offshore divi- r sion and recently to the Brazil- ian Odebrecht group. I Teesside's chemical and pet- e rochemical industry expertise i has likewise attracted many multinationals, yet it has failed in recent years to generate any large homegrown, locally head- quartered, manufacturing com- panies - with the very notable exception of MTM. Founded 12 years ago by ex- ICI employee Richard Lines and another chemical industry manager, MTM is the only quoted company head- quartered in the area. Based in an imposing country house at f Hutton Rudby, just over the border in North Yorkshire, MTM's interim results this week strengthened hopes of a 1991 turnover of Â£130m, up from Â£85m last year. The company, which makes I high-value chemicals, is the kind of manufacturer Cleve- land's job creation bodies are scouring the world to attract. At present most of its 1,000 employees are located over- I seas, but it is now investing Â£100m in a 1,000 job European production and technology cen- tre on a 40 acre former oil refi- nery site at Teesport. The project is a coup for Teesside, but MTM executives say local apprehension about more chemical industry meant they met an initially muted response in some quarters. ICI, sensitive to criticism of its past environmental record, last year earmarked more than Â£80m for improvements to its Teesside operations. The lion's share is for a sulphuric acid recovery plant at Billingham, to eliminate sea disposal by 1993 in line with government requirements. Since the 1970s it has cut by 75 per cent the oxygen-reduc- ing waste discharged into the Tees and migratory fish are returning to its upper reaches for the first time in 50 years. But while ICI is upgrading the environment, there are fears that plans by other com- panies could set back the clock. Proposals for two toxic waste incinerators met fierce opposition; the result of a linked public inquiry is now awaited. More surprisingly perhaps, one of Britain's biggest new industrial investments, the Â£lbn North Sea gas pipeline project, is now creating unease on Teesside. The area's politi- cians lobbied for the pipeline, against competition from Scot- land, because the huge new Â£800m Enron power station which it will fuel will provide cheap feedstock for ICI, thus Even the biggest investment may be a mixed blessing underpinning the viability of its local operations. But the National Grid has now run into major contro- versy over its plans to upgrade the grid system to absorb the output of the Enron station, now under construction at Wil- ton, Teesside. And deep seated resentments have been stirred by fears that the pipeline's im cu ft per day spare capacity could mean the construction of more power stations in Teesside, dominat- ing the local landscape but creating energy for the South of England. Even the future of the Trans- porter Bridge across the Tees, an emotive industrial land- mark since 1911, is now being debated. Out of use following an accident, the cradle and gantry structure needs Â£100,000 of repairs which the county council says it alone cannot afford. One Stockton Tory council- lor Stephen Smailes - a main- tenance fitter who remembers the days when the riverbanks were lined with dirty industry - even says the bridge is now fit \"only for scrap and suicide attempts\". \"We're at the cross roads,\" says Mr Smailes. \"I don't think we will ever get back to the mass of blue collar jobs; those days have gone.\"",

   "text_content" : "THE Teesside Development Corporation is trying to regen- erate some 12,000 acres run- ning between the four bor- oughs of Middlesbrough, Stockton, Langbaurgh and Hartlepool around the River Tees, largely through a num- ber of flagship schemes. There are about 10 schemes as well as some other activities. Some are active, others not. Six are sig- nificant and one is of central importance. Progress is carefully recorded by a monitoring com- mittee made up of the four dis- trict councils and the Cleve- land County Council. The latest report from the commit- tee and information from the TDC provide the following pic- ture. : The key project is TEES- DALE, on an area three times as big as London's Canary Wharf complex. It covers 250 acres of disused industrial land, which previously housed the headquarters of the Head Wrightson engineering con- cern. Eventually this rejuvenation project could cost Â£500m of pri- vate and public sector money. It involves decontamination of the land, the building of a bar- rage, a road bridge, a shopping bridge. and other bridges over newly created canals, as well as main roads and other infra- structure work. The idea is to create more than 800,000 sq ft of offices, 750 homes and about 100,000 sq ft of speciality retail- ing. There would be land- scaped open space and institu- tional, public sector use is also being encouraged. This is the site on which Mrs Margaret Thatcher took her famous \"walk in the wilder- ness\" 10 days after the TDC had started operating in 1987. This carefully staged event gave Teesdale a national pro- file. It seemed to symbolise the government's attempts to revive rundown industrial areas. She was reported as saying at the time that she knew that four years hence she would be walking across an area full of new modern buildings. Well, it is not \"full\" of build- ings. But the first office block, the 100,000 sq ft Dunedin House, has been completed. Wimpey Homes has finished about six units of a 128-dwell- ing development. Tenants are believed to have been found for much of Dunedin House, and there is considerable interest in the Wimpey houses despite the recession because they are competitively priced. The access road, the canal basin and bank wall are all com- pleted. Work has started nn a mad bridge linking Middlesbrough and Stockton and the barrage is due to go ahead at a cost of around Â£18m. This will mean the unattractive mud banks of the Tees, now visible at low tide, will be covered perma- nently and water sports will become possible upstream. The university is also to go ahead, although access to the pro- posed site is still by four-wheel drive vehicle only. TEESSIDE PARK, in Stock- ton, is on the old Stockton racecourse. It is to be linked by road with Teesdale and with Stockton High Street. A link road from the A66 is complete. The whole development is to be worth Â£80m. Apart from the infrastructural work it will comprise 500,000 sq ft of ware- house or retailing and leisure projects. Last year, Marks and Spen- cer was considering a site. But it finally decided not to go ahead. The original builder experi- enced problems and the project was finished by the TDC using local contractors. Although not 1 Harlepool Marina Hartlepool 2 European Chemical Centre 3ToesOffshot Bas 4 Motor Sports Park 5 Internamonal Nature Reerve SMiddlehaven A 7 Riversinde Park 8 Tes Wedr OTeesdes Park lOTeesdale 11 Preston Farm T ./ Ron Norman, Duncan Hall and their honoured guest popular with all the local authorities, the retail park is about 80 per cent let to a few large retailers. The associated leisure devel- opment suffered a setback when the local authority refused to license a night club. Mr Duncan Hall, the chief executive of the TDC, says he has a new developer in mind for the complex which would include a bowling alley and multiple cinema. While the other develop- ments partly overlap, the HARTLEPOOL project is a place apart. Hartlepool Marina is a Â£150m project aided by Â£51m grant by the TDC. Some Â£13m is being spent moving the dock activi- ties to Irvine's Quay, straight- ening the sea entry, and shor- ing up the sea walls. When finished, the dock will be 380 metres long with dockside crane tanks. The move to Irvine's Quay by the port authority will facil- itate the marina development on Warriors Quay . This has already started with 83 of the 400 proposed berths in place. Work has started on the first 30 units of an associated hous- ing development. These have not so far attracted much inter- est because they initially seemed highly priced. Eventu- ally there will be restaurants, bars and a maritime heritage centre, if the development goes to plan. PRESTON FARM, Stockton, is where much of Teesside's new industrial and warehous- ing property has been built some 1.25m sq ft to date. This was also where the Ministry of Defence was going to move its Quality Assurance Directorate. That would mean 1,500 new jobs, but Defence Ministry cuts leave it unclear whether the move is still on. RIVERSIDE PARK, Middles brough, includes the Britannia enterprise zone and has been one of the most successful of the local authorities' initiatives in recent years. Although listed as one of the TDC's flag- ship projects, local councillors point out it was well advanced before the TDC was set up and was already developing a momentum of its own. The TDC has become involved in some projects latterly. Three more areon hold: At Middlehaven, there were plans for a200-acre site based on the old Middlesbrough docks. But British Urban Development, a consortium of 11 large building contractors, withdrew because members wanted a large input of public money - partly to relocate a tank farm - before commit- ting themselves. A hospital and a university campus were mooted as possible develop- ments. The TDC still holds that pri- vate sector commitment must come before large amounts of public money can be laid out. Mr Hall claims to have a devel- oper in mind. It is still possible that a hospital project will go ahead, even though the tank farm is not to be moved. It now seems that the college or \"uni- versity\" will go to Teesdale. At Langbaurgh Motorsports Complex, Langbaurgh, there are proposals for a Â£20m race- track, hotel, motor museum, motorcross, cyclecross and lei- sure development. But the planning application has been blocked because of worries about noise. The land devel- oper Mr Tom Wheatcroft may submit another planning appli- cation. In January 1989, David Bel- lamy and Associates published a feasibility study for an Inter- national Nature Reserve, at Stockton. It proposed that 20 so km of land on the North Tees, including sites of special scien- tific interest at Seal Sands Cowpen Marsh, North Gare, should become the Teesside World Park. But little progress has been made. These nine flagship schemes do not include all the TDC's efforts but they do represent the developments on which its reputation will ultimately rest.",

   "text_content" : "ONLY three years after it opened, Belasis Hall Technol- ogy Park has filled its first 50 acres with 45 businesses rang- ing in size from one-persop start-ups to fast-growing com- panies employing up to 65 peo- ple. The space was budgeted to last between five and seven years, going on the experience of other science parks in the UK. Now, expansion plans have had to be brought for- ward. The backers are ICI and English Estates. The park is in Billlngham, across the road from one of ICI's large com- plexes of chemical plant on Teesside, in what was once 160 acres of farmland. Despite the bucolic setting, it is an experi- ment in urban economic recon- struction. This helps explain why the Department of the Environ- ment found Â£800,000 for it from its urban funds, matching simi- lar sums from ICI and English Estates. On top of the resultant Â£2.4m, came the land - free from ICI - and development expertise from English Estates, the government's commercial property developer. Belasis is part of a general drive to change Teesside's industrial culture, broaden its economic base and reduce dependence on too few big employers such as ICI and Brit- ish Steel. The idea is not so much to try and escape from the area's dominant industries, but to use their strengths to help and protect new business and encourage the growth of a high technology, small busi- ness sector. As science parks go, Belasis is unusual because its umbili- cal cord is not to a university but to ICI, which offers a wide range of facilities, services and resources to the newcomers. These include a technical library, databases, laboratories and experts. Human resources have to be hired at the internal prices ICI charges its own cost centres, but some facilities - such as browsing in the library - cannot realistically be charged and therefore come free. Belasis's central administra- tion costs ICI about Â£200,000 and is run by Mr George Hunter, a chemical engineer who formerly headed manage- ment services for ICI at Bil- lingham. \"New technology was caus- ing a lot of redundancy but we did not just want to create more jobs of the type that were being lost because that would not have helped the local econ- omy escape its dependence on heavy industry and big employers,\" he says. \"In the mid-1980s, ICI was trying to spin new businesses out to develop in new, smaller, more efficient niches. We wanted an environment where they would not be smothered trying to grow up within a giant organisation. \"They needed to be out of the protective cocoon in the world of commercial reality, but with an umbilical cord back to ICI to help their One of the ite's growing test chances of survival. I f we were going to develop this sort of environment anyway, it was only a short step to make it more widely available.\" The result has been about 500 new jobs so far, but no slackening of inquiries during the recession. Recession seems to have caused a slowdown in final decisions by potential incomers to commit them- selves to set up, but Mr Hunter believes that several are on the brink, waiting for economic upturn. He is ensuring that the next 65 acres of the park are land- scaped and serviced, ready for them when wanted. Buildings will be available, or land for bigger companies to build on for themselves. Funding is from the same Â£2.4m that went into the first 50 acres: it has been recouped from developers who have paid for premium leases lasting 125 years, so its redeployment in the next stage of development means that the funds are already revolving. One of the leases was bought by Foster Church, the devel- oper of a small business centre in Chelsea, which has spent P6.3m on a big, 100,000 sq ft one at Belasis, the central facilities of which even include a first- class restaurant for corporate entertaining. So far only three companies have failed, two the result of the recession rather than mis- calculation of market potential by the entrepreneur. \"The fall- ure rate is low in science parks because advice and support is available and we aim to keep it that way,\" Mr Hunter says. The experience has been valuable for ICI, however, because it has also encouraged a different type of industrial park across the road from Belasis Technology Park in the main chemical works. There, ICI is cutting back on the space it uses, not just because of the decline in its agricultural chemicals busi- ness but because new technol- ogy has reduced the size of plant needed for processes in which it is continuing to oper- ate. It means that 200 acres of \"brownfield\" site will shortly be available. The central facili- ties, services and resources available here will be highly unusual - the industrial infra- structure needed to set up sev- eral sizeable chemical manu- facturing operations. ICI is clearing the site of its own redundant plant but leav- ing intact the pipelines and other equipment that carry oxygen, gas for process heat- ing, steam, and electricity from 33,000 volts downwards. \"Pinky\" and \"Perky\" - two large, twin water cooling tow- ers - will supply cooling. Mr Hunter is in charge of marketing the Belasis Process Park, as the new venture is known and says that he has already been inundated with inquiries from North America and the Far East. \"The advan- tage is that the cost of inward investment will be greatly reduced by an incoming com- pany not having to set up a services infrastructure. The capital cost would be mainly that of the process plant.\" The hope is that the process park will provide- another important element for broaden- ing Teesside's economic base because it will almost certainly cater best for medium-sized projects, helping to bridge the gap between the existing gigantic companies and the plethora of small businesses which most attempts at recon- struction inevitably foster. Not that the latter should be sniffed at. British Steel Indus- try - the job-creation subsid- iary of British Steel - has run managed workshon Tees, side for the last decade, help- ing its tenants to create hun- dreds of Jobs. Meanwhile, Cleveland Busi- ness Development Agency - formed two years ago from the merger of the county's enter- prise agency and its youth business centre - last year dealt with 732 new clients and 549 existing clients seeking business advice. The important thing here, however, was that only 47 per cent of those who came for -help were unemployed people hoping to start a small busi- ness as a way off the dole. The rest were either already self-employed and hoping to grow, or already employed but hoping to start on their own. Mr Eric Sugden, the agency's chief executive, says that nine years ago the enterprise agency dealt almost exclu- sively with unemployed people made redundant in the last recession. They were desperate for help in a community where almost everyone was used to being employed by a large company and where genera- tions had never had to find work for themselves Recently, he negotiated a contract with the local training and enterprise council to run a support programme for start-up businesses. Experience on Teesside and elsewhere has taught him that 10 per cent will be very successful and grow, 20 per cent will fail and 70 per cent will never be more than \"plodders\". But the last time unemploy- ment was growing on Teesside as recession bit, enterprise agencies were in their infancy and places such as Belasis Hall Technology Park did not exist. There is still a long way to go, but a start has been made. Ian Hamllton-Fazey",

   "text_content" : "r 1 t i i i i \"MY biggest problem is convincing journalists like you that everything is going ahead as planned,\" said Duncan Hall, the chief executive of the Teesside Development Corporation. He was reacting to my comment that I had seen developers in many parts of the country succumb to the fierce recession and therefore wondered about the wisdom of erecting 500,000 sq ft of new retail space in an area apparently well served for shop- ping. Mr Hall replied that doubters should not take his word for it but inspect the urban development area for themselves. In some ways, the Teesside Development Corporation has one of the most difficult tasks of all Britain's 11 urban development corporations (UDCs). It is easily the biggest, covering some 19 sq miles or almost 12,000 acres. Most of the area is contiguous but there is a separate zone in Hartlepool. Fewer than 1,000 peo- ple live within the area, 5,500 less than when the corporation was set up in 1987. Teesside was and is an area of heavy and dirty industry. There were three main industries - chemicals, steel and ship- building - with related ports. ICI and British Steel are still the two biggest pri- vate sector employers but their operations have been dramatically slimmed down. ICI now employs around 12,000 people on Teesside, half its previous workforce. Shipbuilding, the third heavy industry, has virtually disappeared. In the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s Teesside went from boom to bust very quickly. Unemployment rose to well over 20 per cent for adult males. With little service industry in the area, female unemploy- ment was also high. In July, unemploy- ment in Cleveland county was 13.9 per cent overall, with a male rate of 18.8 per cent Compared with Nissan's investment in Sunderland and the revival on Tyneside, Teesside appeared to be having less suc- cess in reviving its economy. The area's dependence on a few large employers hampered attempts at diversifi- cation, providing little scope entrepreneur- ial spirit and arousing insufficient interest among private developers. Mr Hall claims that until his corporation appeared there had been no wholly private sector development of industrial premises for more than 20 years, although English Estates, the government-owned developer, had been involved in building factories, as had the local authorities. Moreover, much of the land the corpora- Defying the doublers: Mr Hall outside some of the Corporation's units tion took over or has subsequently pur- chased from the local authorities and pri- vate concerns was environmentally unappetising. Much of it was derelict or polluted by former industrial use. It takes time and money to make such land suit- able for use again. Mr Hall is nothing if not a professional optimist, however. He made his name in Corby, Northants., where as chief execu- tive he transformed the town's fortunes by steeply reducing unemployment after the closure of its steel works. He is confident the TDC can do the same for Teesside. He comes from the area and his family lives nearby. He prefers to use local or northern developers when he can. His staff of 39 have been recruited locally. He believes strongly in promotion and publicity and, because his area is the big- gest UDC, it is generously funded, with Â£200m committed by the government over its proposed seven year life. Assessing the Teesside Development Corporation's success so far is complicated by the fact that some initiatives were underway before the corporation was set up. The CadCam Centre, where high tech- nology resources are available to tenants on the Riverside Park estate, was encour- aged by Cleveland County Council. The TDC has taken over development of a new stage of the CadCam. Riverside Park incorporates an enter- prise zone of 190 acres. The land has now almost been used up, as has the land in the enterprise zone In HartlepooL Another scheme thought of before the TDC began was the Tees Offshore Centre. This is on the Smith's Dockyard site owned by the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority. The TDC made a commitment to the scheme. Now there are 12 concerns involved in offshore services, and 1,000 people are employed there. Mr Hall hopes that his Â£200m of govern- ment money will generate Â£lbn of private sector investment and help to create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. The area could contain 2.5m sq ft of industrial space, im sq ft of office space, well over 500,000 sq ft of retail and associated leisure developments. In addi- tion, there could be thousands of homes, a university, five hotels, a hospital and a home for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. How soon all this could materialise is questionable. Not all the flagship schemes are active and some developers have pul- led out. However, only one developer has had problems once its scheme was well under way. This was the retail develop- ment on Teesside Park. It was finished using local contractors. The grand design is unlikely to be com- pleted by the time the TDC is due to be wound up in three and a half years. But it has already created some landmarks. It may not be as fast as some critics would wish or as Mr Hall himself might privately want. But progress is being made. Stewart Dalby",

   "text_content" : "THE Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority last month became the first of Britain's \"trust ports\" to bid for privatisation. The move from trust to com- mercial company status would transform the business from being tied to harbour improve- ments to using its cash and profits for a much wider range of port-related operations. The port is a valuable prize, even though at first glance its report and accounts can give a confusing picture of what it actually does. They say that the THPA runs the third larg- east port in the UK in tonnage terms with 40m tonnes passing through, but the volumes of trade which it manages seem a fraction of this. For example, the THPA's two general docks handle only 3.5m of cargo, while more than 2m tonnes a year of general cargo go through Tees Dock. Hartlepool docks handles approximately Im tonnes a year. This is because the port of Teesside is a series of docks along the River Tees and at Hartlepool. The majority of tonnage is shipped by Phillips Norsea, ICI and British Steel, which have private terminals on the River Tees. Bulk petrochemicals are the largest single export some 17.6m tonnes in 1990. Not surprisingly, therefore, the attention ICI is receiving from the Hanson group, which has taken a threatening 2.8 per cent equity stake in the giant chemicals conglomerate, is causing some anxiety around the port as elsewhere in Tees- side. The Tees has provided an important trade route since the 11th century, although the emphasis has gradually shifted down river. First the centre of activity was well inland at Yarm, then Stockton, then Middlesbrough and now Tees- port, nearer the river's mouth and the North Sea. Hartlepool was developed mainly by the railway companies indepen- dently of the activity on the Tees. In the 19th century the riv- er's commercial business was managed by the Tees Naviga- tion Company, which was cre- ated by an Act of Parliament, and the Tees Conservancy Commission, which was set up by another Act of Parliament. The Tees Conservancy Com- mission continued until 1966. It had representatives from the Admiralty, Stockton Corpora- tion, Middlesbrough and Yarm ratepayers. Hartlepool Docks changed ownership as the railway com- panies developed and amal- gamated and eventually became a separate nationalised organisation called the British Transport Docks Board. In 1962, the government decided to set up independent estuarial port authorities. The Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority was created by a pri- vate Act of Parliament as a trust port in 1966, taking responsibility for running or regulating the port operations on the Tees and at Hartlepool. It was a national dock labour scheme port, whose dockers had a veto on modernisation. Separating the port author- ity's business from the wider port activities along the Tees is difficult. Some of the private terminals along the river run by the large steel and chemi- cals companies are on land owned by the port authority. All told, the port authority is thought to own around 1,500 acres in the area. The core activities of the THPA, however, are at Tees- port and at Hartlepool. Its Teesport container terminal has recently been expanded to handle 110,000 containers a year. There are two roll-on, roll-off terminals with 10 hect- ares of open storage and 15,000 sq metres of covered storage. The tidal berths have 24-hour access. There are five general cargo berths along two quays. There is a bulk handling cargo han- dling terminal which is leased to Teesbulk Handling. It han- dles such materials as potash, soda ash, coal and grain at a rate of some Im tonnes a year. Apart from the bulk han- dling and the containers there are also steel, forest products and cars. Nissan has some 32 hectares of secure, fully paved com- pounds for the import of cars from Japan and the export of cars from Nissan's Washington factory in Sunderland. In total, the Teesport has a throughput of around 2.5m tonnes. At Hartlepool, the total ton- nage is closer to Im tones. Timber is a speciality and together with pulp paper board and sheet materials, accounts for 600,000 tonnes a year. There is also scrap, bulk cargoes and cars. Indeed, more than 100,000 cars are imported each year through Hartlepool, and Gen- eral Motors has a seven hect- are compound. In conjunction with the Tees- side Development Corporation, the THPA has been developing the Hartlepool pleasure marina at Warrior Quay. The first 83 berths have been built. Exist- ing port activities have been shifted from Warrior Quay to Irvine's Quay, with access to the docks straightened and deepened. The THPA has also been involved in developing the old Smith's Dockyard with the TDC and the Teesside Off- shore Centre. Currently, more than 1,000 people are employed by the 12 companies using the Offshore Centre. The THPA, acting indepen- dently, has re-opened a disused dock in Middlesbrough, which this year hopes to handle 100,000 tonnes. It is in an area called Middlehaven, which the TDC hopes to develop, so far with little success. Despite profits of Â£10.9m last year, the THPA has clearly been frustrated that as a trust port it cannot make use of the opportunities created by the end of the dock labour scheme and the approach of the single European market in 1992 fully to develop its business. This is because under the terms of the Tees and Hartle- pool Port Authority Act of 1966 it is unable to undertake any activity not substantially directed towards the improve- ment of the harbour. This pre- vents it using its large cash resources to develop a more broadly based business. Accordingly, it introduced a private Bill into the House of Commons in November 1989 to change its status from a trust port to a commercial company. The bill failed at the House of Lords Committee stage but the port is now trying again, this time under the government's own Ports Act. The THPA feels that among other things there is now wide scope for port-related ware- housing. There has been very little of this in the past because distributors have been fright- ened that dock strikes could lock goods into ports. At Teesport, there is some 200 acres which can be devel- oped for new business. Mr Allan Duncan, the port manager says: \"It is not neces- sarily cheaper to warehouse and distribute from a port, but it is where companies want to be. Nissan, for example, could develop a hub operation here.\" There is also scope for enhancing Teesside as a bulk, non-passenger outlet with ancillary activities. All depends now on who will win the auction for the port. The management and work- force hope to buy it but pros- pects are good and the prize may well attract strong rivals, even though the price is likely to be as high as Â£120m.",

   "text_content" : "FEW local authorities, particularly those controlled by the Labour party, are enthu- siastic about urban develop- ment corporations being set up in their midst. Cleveland County Council is no exception. In theory, it is opposed to the Teesside Devel- opment Corporation because it is appointed and funded directly by the central govern- ment in London. It sees it as undemocratic and unaccount- able to locally elected politi- cians. It also feels that because UDCs are established for a lim- ited period in Teesside's case, seven years they are under pressure to do something quickly and may not therefore think strategically. Mr John Gillis, the head of the economic development unit at the Cleveland County Coun- cil, says that the council is in the best position to take a stra- tegic view of development. The four district councils to some extent fight their own corners when it comes to obtaining projects, while the county council has taken ini- tiatives in training and job cre- ation which benefit the whole area. It is also responsible for some infrastructural work. Mr Gillis says the council has long been at odds with the central government over the question of manufacturing. Cleveland is a manufacturing area and the council believes the government has not done enough to rebuild it. Some members of the coun- cil feel frustrated that they have a budget of only Â£15m for capital spending while the TDC has millions more. It is not just sour grapes - there is strong feeling that the TDC some- times spends money on pro- jects which are not wholly suit- able for the area. Mr David Walsh, the chair- man of the economic develop- ment and transport commit- tees of the council, says that despite the way that shipbuild- ing, chemicals and steel sus- fered in the shakeout of the early 1980s, there is a still a good base in Teesside with which to rebuild manufactur- ing industry. Stressing that he was speak- ing for himself and not reflecting the views of the council, he says that rather than put a retail park on the Stockton racecourse, the land could have been used to attract Middlesbrough shopping mall: a need for flagships industrial developments which would provide good jobs. \"I'm not saying that we do not need to diversify our econ- omy. But we do have a good industrial base on which to build. I'm not sure that putting up retail warehouses is the best way to create the kind of jobs we need,\" Mr Walsh says. The development of Teesside Park, as the Stockton race- course was renamed, also drew criticism from Stockton district councillors. Some felt that building retail outlets on this site would only serve to draw shoppers away from Stockton high street and the centre of Middlesbrough - particularly after road and bridge develop- ments are completed to link Teesside Park directly to Stockton high street. Mr Michael Carr, the leader of the Labour-dominated Middlesbrough Borough coun- cil, says there were also qualms among Middlesbrough councillors about the effect of Teesside on its town centre. However, he also sees merit in the development. \"Although retailing may not be ideal, in an area of high unemployment, a job is a job at the end of the day,\" he says. His reservation about the TDC is that he would like to see more done in Middles- brough, and particularly for the Middlehaven development, in Middlesbrough's old dock- lands, to go ahead. A plan to develop the 200 acre site fal- tered when British Urban Development (Bud) -- a con- sortium of 11 major contractors - pulled out after failing to agree with the TDC about funding. The port authority has since started to re-use part of the dock, but there are no major developments in prospect. Another Middlesbrough coun- cillor said: \"I'm sure that Dun- can Hall, the TDC chief execu- tive, could find a developer for Middlehaven, but he is concen- trating all his efforts on his real flagship, Teesdale. Tees- dale happens to be in Stock- ton.\" Mr Hall says he will find a developer for Middlehaven, but the TDC will not put up money until he has a private devel- oper. He says private and pub- lic sector money must be com- mitted simultaneously, not with the private sector lagging, as Bud wanted. This means that Mr Hall will not reclaim contaminated land or put in access roads using public money in the hope that a developer will then come along. Mr Carr is on the board of the TDC, exemplifying the the- ory that it is better on the inside looking out than vice versa. \"As a Labour council we are opposed to quangos like devel- opment corporations. We feel the democratically elected offi- cials who are accountable should administer the funds. But we are realistic enough to go where the money is.\" The other three district councils and the county coun- cil, all of which are Labour Party controlled, take a similar pragmatic view of the TDC, but at the heart of their criticisms is the hard fact that the local government has had to take a back seat in the shaping of Teesside's future. Sensitivities are further aroused by the prospect of fur- ther reform of local govern- ment and the imposition of a- single unitary authority. Indeed, Teesside always seems to be on the wrong side of reorganisation. Under the reform of 1968 there was a core body, the Teesside Borough Council, which pulled together the separate districts. This dis- appeared in 1974 to be replaced by Cleveland County Council., On paper it made sense to have one authority for the river and estuary, theoretically enabling the entire area to be developed strategically. But, as with Humberside, this group- ing together overlooked the fact that some districts had dis- tinct identities and different pulls on their loyalties. County allegiances are fur- ther complicated by those on the north of the Tees looking to Durham and those people on the south who incline towards North Yorkshire, the county seat of which, Northallerton, is only minutes away from Tees- side's borders. The county council feels that if there is to be a unitary authority it should be the Cleveland council and there should be decentralisation down to the districts. Mr Carr equally predictably feels that any single authority should be as close to the grass roots as possible. He feels that county councillors are often not familiar with inner city problems. He argues that despite the separate identities of Stockton, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool there would be no problem in developing a sin- gle authority on district lines. Langbaurgh, the fourth bor- ough council in Cleveland, is an artificial creation of 1974. It takes in Redcar and rural vil- lages bordering North York- shire. The proposed Local Govern- ment Commission, which will decide the structure of local authorities over the next two years, is committed to give pri- ority to local views on what should be done. Sorting out the prevailing view on Teesside looks something of a problem.",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR fnished slightly firmer in European foreign exchange trading yesterday, but was well below the day's peak after falling to hold above resistance at DM1.7010, as the market waited for today's fig- ures on US producer prices and tomorrow's consumer price index for August. At the London close the dol- lar rose to DM1.6970 from DM1.6945; to Y134.90 from Y134.80; to SFr1.4860 from SFr1.4800; and to FFr5.7725 from FFr5.7600. On Bank of England figures its index was unchanged at 65.3. Good demand was seen for the Canadian dollar from Ger- man and Japanese investors. The Bank of Canada bought US dollars as the the currency fell below C$1.1380. Interest rate factors favoured the Canadian unit following a firming of Canadian short term rates and speculation about an easing of US monetary policy. In the European exchange rate mechanism the French franc remained the weakest member, but rumours of a cut in official interest rates proved unfounded. The Bank of France left its intervention rate at 9.00 per cent when injecting funds into the Paris money market yesterday. The peseta eased slightly at the top of the ERM ahead of today's data of Spanish infla- tion. Interest rates in Madrid had a nervous tone, but fin- ished little changed. The Belgian franc was steady as second strongest member of the ERM after the Belgian National Bank held a floating rate tender for 28-day money market credits. This was the first time the central bank had held a tender for 28- day funds and was meant to establish a suitable level for one-month money. The author- ities in Brussels were unhappy that Euro Belgian franc one- month rates had drifted below equivalent German rates. A statement issued by the Belgian National Bank said that \"until further notice we want to avoid a negative inter- est rate differential (with Ger- many) in short-term rates.\" At the tender 28-day funds were allocated at 9f4 per cent com- pared 9 per cent bid on the money market. This was seen as a move to keep the Belgian frtanc tied to the D-Mark in the ERM. The German currency rose to third from fifth stron- gest in the system. The narrowing of interest rate differentials between lon- don and Frankfurt led to a ner- vous weakening of sterling. Dealers said that further cuts in UK bank base could put pressure on the pound unless the ruling Conservative party build up a big enough lead in opinion polls to justify an early general election. There was speculation that the govern- ment may attempt to improve its economic standing by tak- ing sterling into the narrow ERM band in the next few weeks. Sterling fell 45 points to $1.7255. It also declined to DM2.9275 from DM2.9325; to Y232.75 from Y233.25; and to FFr9.9600 from FFr9.9650, but rose to SFr2.5650 from SFr2.5600. The pound's index lost 0.1 to 91.2.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street SHARE PRICES idled in a nar- row range yesterday as inves- tors struggled to find reasons to buy stocks in the absence of the hoped-for interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 4.47 at 2,987.03, having never strayed more than a few points from opening the mark. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was also slightly firmer, up 0.53 at 385.09, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter issues gained 3.48 to 514.76. NYSE turnover was again light at 149m shares, with declines outnumbering rises by 801 to 708. Short-term selling pressure appeared to have been exhausted after the sharp fall in stock values on Tuesday, and yesterday was a period of quiet consolidation as the mar- ket awaited today and tomor- row's key producer and con- sumer prices data. The fundamentals, however, remain mostly negative; the economic recovery is still in its infancy; the corporate profits outlook remains gloomy; and the Federal Reserve continues to display a marked reluctance to ease policy. In this climate, said analysts, sentiment was likely to remain subdued. Among individual stocks, Morgan Stanley rose $1% to $43%. The stock fell heavily on Tuesday amid rumours that the investment bank would be implicated in the scandal sur- rounding the rigging of Trea- sury auctions by Salomon Brothers. The shares recov- ered, however, after Morgan denied that it was the target of any special investigation by regulators. Salomon shares edged $% higher to $24%. Tenneco slumped $2%/ to $40% in 2m shares after the company announced that it was cutting its dividend in half, raising $300m in equity capital, reducing capital spend- ing by $250m in 1991, and sell- ing $500m in assets. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, climbed $3%' to $59 in active trading on news that the group was launching a corporate- wide cost-cutting programme that would reduce capital spending by almost $500m over the next five years. Kansas Gas & Electricity rose $1'/% to $30% after its merger with Kansas Power & Light was approved by the government. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, Proteon slumped $2% to $13'/. after the company warned that its third quarter income would be several cents below the 11 cents a share it earned in the second quarter. Another big loser on a prof- its warning was Teknekron Communications, which fell $1 to $8 after projecting net income in the third quarter would only match the 17 cents a share reported in the second quarter. US Healthcare rose $1% to $23% on more than 4m shares after the board of the group approved the re-pur- chase of up to 5m shares of its common stock. Ecogen rose $% to $10% after Merrill Lynch ini- tiated coverage of the stock with an initial \"above average\" rating, arguing that the shares were undervalued. Canada TORONTO share prices ended lower in moderate trading, adding to the previous day's 30-point slide. Based on preliminary data, the composite index fell 19.39 to close at 3,428.76. Losing issues doubled advancers at 360 to 182, and volume of 25.1m shares was above the previous 21.9m shares. Trading value fell to C$270.9m from C$276.1m. Eleven of the 14 industrial sub-groups ended the day lower, led by gold issues, off 3.14 per cent on index. SOUTH AFRICA GOLDS were hit as bullion prices plunged to 15-month lows on a newspaper report of secret Soviet sales. The all- gold index lost 60 or 5 per cent to 1,133. The industrial index fell 41 to 4,196 and the all- share index fell 51 to 3,407.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo INDEX-LINKED buying by arbitrageurs lifted the Nikkei average for the first time in three days, while a stronger yen and higher bond prices also encouraged investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 93.21 at 22,504.79 after a day's low of 22,270.14 and high of 22,573.89. Domestic investors did some light buying, and volume rose from 300m shares to 400m, but declines still outpaced advances by 555 to 381 with 178 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 0.48 off at 1,748.36, but in London the ISE/ Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.90 to 1,323.20. Foreigners were also net buyers of stock, but Mr Nick Cant of Baring Securities said their activity had been scaled down ahead of the expiry of futures contracts this week. The market's recent worries over the September futures expiry seem to have eased as the balance of arbitrage-related long cash positions have declined from record highs. In addition, arbitrageurs have been rolling over positions into the December futures. The settlement price of Sep- tember futures will be deter- mined by the opening prices of the 225 component stocks of the Nikkei index. Arbitrageurs are expected to try to push prices down. Market partici- pants have been worried that the low volumes would not be able to withstand heavy sell- ing, but the recent rise in vol- umes has soothed some of this concern. Cancer drug-related issues were again popular yesterday. Meii Seika, which announced the development of an anti-can- cer drug last month, firmed Y1 to Y975 and Toray Industries gained Y22 to Y644. Securities companies fell on reports that they would post sharp falls in earnings for the interim period to September. Nomura Securities slipped Y10 to Y1,630 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to Y1,230. Shipping-related shares were strong in anticipation of a global recovery in the shipping industry. Hitachi Zosen advanced Y15 to Y680 and Ishi- kawajima-Harima Heavy Industries added Y36 at Y705. Chugoku Marine, a leading maker of ship-bottom paints, eased Y2 to Y918 on profit-tak- ing after two days of sharp gains. Investors were encour- aged by expectations of strong sales thanks to increasing ship- building demand. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 79.14 to 24,822.59 in volume of 80.2m shares. Roundup THE PHILIPPINES fell further on worries about the economic fall-out of the potential removal of the US military bases. Other markets in the region were little changed. MANILA plunged 5.4 per cent for a loss over three days of 10.8 per cent. The drop came as hopes faded that the Philip- pine Senate would ratify the new US military bases pact. The composite index fell 51.33 to 895.28 on turnover of 139m pesos, up from 100m. PLDT weakened 25 pesos to 502.50 pesos and Philippine National Bank dropped 22.50 pesos to 285 pesos. AUSTRALIA achieved a small rise on bargain hunting, the All Ordinaries index gain- ing 2.9 to 1,561.0. Turnover amounted to A$168m, against Tuesday's A$140m. TNT, the transport group, climbed 7 cents or 7.5 per cent to A$1.01 in volume of 6.4m shares, on rumours of a large European buying order and news that America West Air- lines, its troubled associate, was a possible takeover target for Northwest Airlines. TAIWAN reversed early gains, the weighted index clos- ing 53.59 or 1.1 per cent lower at 4,668.49 after thin trading. BANGKOK eased on profit- taking, with the SET index shedding 7.23 or 1 per cent to 722.59 on turnover of Bt3bn. SEOUL rose in busy trading but ended below the day's high. The composite index gained 2.02 at 690.71 in turn- over of Won387bn, up from Won201bn. HONG KONG edged higher in quiet trading as the market awaited next week's results from Jardine Matheson. The Hang Seng index put on 7.6N to 3,966.93 in turnover of HK$985m, down from HK$1.12bn. KUALA LUMPUR declined in uncertain trading. The compos- ite index receded 3.82 to 548.78 in volume of 27m shares (29m).",

   "text_content" : "HE INFLUX of visitors travelling by car to the Barcelona Olympics and the Seville World Trade Fair (Expo 92) next year Is expected to boost profits for some of Spain's toll road operators. ? This, together with the pros- pect of interest rate cuts, has Spersuaded many equity ana- 1 lysts to pick the sector as one r of Spain's most attractive. B As in France and Italy, driv- ers have to pay to use some Spanish motorways. The gov- I ermnent has granted conces- sions to companies to build and operate these toll roads, the four main listed operators f being Acesa, which is the r largest, Aumar, Europistas and Iberpistas, the smallest. At t the end of a fixed period the motorway assets revert to the state. 1 The companies' profits I depend on the tariffs charged t and the amount of traffic using r the roads. Annual increases 3in tariffs are fixed at 95 per I cent of the previous year's inflation rate, leading Salomon Brothers to conclude: \"The defensive nature of the Span- ish motorway sector makes it attractive. The stable tariff framework . . .makes the shares virtually inflation- proof.\" The sector has outperformed the Madrid general index over the last year. It had a setback in the first quarter of this year as attention turned to cyclical stocks, which had been over- sold during the Gulf crisis. But since then, motorway shares have resumed their climb. Acesa has gained 45 per cent over the last 12 months, corn pared with a rise of 5 per cent in the Madrid general index. Iberpistas is up 22 per cent over the same period, while Europistas and Aumar are both ahead 19 per cent. Mr Tony Williams, construc- tion analyst at Morgan Stan- ley, believes there is a question mark over the motorway sector in the longer term, as activity subsides after the Olympics and the Seville fair. In common with the rest of the construction sector, growth is likely to slow down from 1993, he says. \"The Spanish construction industry has had a phenomenal rate of growth, with compound growth in the five years to 1990 of 11 per cent, compared with 4 per cent in the UK and 4.5 per cent in Germany. But that will now moderate,\" he adds. Because the companies have to borrow to finance the build- ing and initial operation of the roads, current hopes of interest rate cuts make the shares attractive. Even foreign rate reductions help because - Inde 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 Sour hibx mid dwre ad. rebaued 36p iWsO Swo.: DImimnu Ivu1 CU excluding Iberpistas - financ- ing of domestic origin, includ- ing shareholders' equity, can- not be greater than 50 per cent of total financing. \"The longer term case for the sector remains the impact of conver- gence of real interest rates within Europe,\" says Barclays de Zoete Wedd. FG, the Madrid-based broker- age, agrees that lower interest rates in the medium term, combined with the automatic tariff revision and the growth in traffic volumes, have increased the sector's appeal. \"At the present time, the motorway sector stands out as one of the most attractive sec- tors for investment in the Spanish stock market,\" it says. The brokerage rates Acesa as the most attractive. Acesa operates the largest toll motor- way network in Spain, amount- ing to 507km of roads - 29 per cent of the total - under an agreement which was recently extended until the year 2016. Acesa is favoured mainly for its reversion fund coverage - each company has to set up a reversion fund, into which it places a percentage of earnings when profits exceed a certain proportion of the share capital. This means that, when the company returns its main assets - the motorways - to the state at the end of the con- cession, shareholders get their money back, together with any additional shareholders' funds. Acesa, says FG, has the high- est reversion fund coverage and the longest period, 25 years, in which to cover it. In addition, Acesa's first-half results were better than expec- ted, with a rise of 13 per cent in profits before tax and rever- sion fund contributions. Because of the fixed time limit of the motorway conces- sions, Mr Inigo Lecubarri of Salomon Brothers evaluates the stocks by comparing them with similar maturity bonds. He also favours Acesa, saying it offers the highest equity risk premium and that it is a high- quality company. He says he would be a buyer of the shares up to a price of Ptal,300 ($12) or more, compared with a price yesterday of Ptal,160. Acesa is likely to benefit from higher road usage next year. Mr Ricardo Barcelona of Nomura Securities says: \"An increase in traffic flow during the Olympic Games and the Seville Fair will give a one-off boost to revenues. The timing is fortunate because Acesa needs cash to finance its expansion of the motorway system - in most cases it is adding a lane to its roads. A good cash flow figure in 1992 will, therefore, reduce its requirement to borrow.\" Several analysts also favour Europistas, which holds a 105km motorway concession in the Basque region. They like the stock because it is eligible for an interest-free subsidy when average daily traffc vol- ume falls below 19,800 cars. However, BZW, which is posi- tive on the stock, says good traffic volume growth will per- mit the company to forego a Pta280m subsidy, and so raise its dividend by 25 per cent to Ptal25 in 1991. Individual companies in the sector are not universally pop- ular. Aumar, which runs 468km of motorway along the Mediterranean coast, is depen- dent on seasonal, tourist traf- sic. Although its profits growth has been good, FG says that \"the growth has not been suffi- cient to compensate for the fact that, with just 14 years before the expiry of the conces- sion, it has only satisfied 3.8 per cent of its reversion fund contributions, and dividend growth is limited\". Salomon says Aumar is more sensitive than its peers to any deterioration in earnings pros- pects, given its location in low- income, coastal areas. How- ever, it points out: \"It will probably be the greatest benefi- ciary of the Barcelona Olympic Games and the Seville World Trade Fair in 1992.\"",

   "text_content" : "BOURSES were little changed yesterday in quiet trading, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had a brief spurt of buying, and the FAZ index rose 1.16 to 675.64 at mid- session, but the mood passed and the DAX closed 0.93 lower at 1,628.19. Volume rose from DM3.4bn to DM3.5bn. Banks staged a minor recov- ery after falls earlier this week. Carmakers failed to move on - the Frankfurt motor show, and Porsche dropped another DM10 to DM715 after Tuesday's fore- cast that it will have to strug- gle to maintain sales and prof- its in 1991-92. Retailers were mostly better, the main exception being Asko with a fall of DM14 to DM860. Mr Brian Wilkinson at Paribas Capital Markets said that the market was looking ahead to what could be a big rights issue for Asko. On Kaufhof, up DM8 at DM505, he said the stock had underperformed the sector, which was close to five- year lows relative to the mar- ket. Kaufhof made some pre- sentations in Tokyo last week. PARIS stayed in an eight- point range, as the CAC 40 index closed 2.09 higher at 1,842.56 in quiet trading. Com- ments by President Frangois Mitterrand that he would authorise partial privatisations of government-owned compa- nies came late in the session. Similar government state- ments had lifted investment certificates in state-controlled companies last week. Cerus, the French holding company of Mr Carlo de Bene- detti of Italy, gained FFr4 or 3.1 per cent to FFr131 in heavy volume of 680,850 shares, including at least one block of 100,000 shares. The company denied reports that it was con- templating the sale of Banque Dumdnil Lebld. MILAN was concerned that shares controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti would suffer as a result of his group's involve- ment in the recent stock scan- dal. Turnover was estimated at below Tuesday's L69bn. Cir, the industrial holding company of the group, fell L24 to L2,481 while Cofide, the financial holding of the group, lost L40 to L2,390. Olivetti fell L53 to L3,195; the computer company reports interim results on September 27. Generali fell L240 to L29,410 ahead of its L1.75 trillion rights issue next week. MADRID edged lower in light trading ahead of today's inflation figure for August. The Madrid general index fell 0.69 to 269.91 in steady turnover of about Pta7bn. Cepsa was suspended at Tuesday's price of Pta2,230, after a Madrid newspaper said that Elf Aquitaine of France would have to make a public bid to raise its stake in the oil refiner to 34 per cent from 20.5 per cent. STOCKHOLM was lifted by optimism that Sunday's elec- tion will be won by the conser- vative opposition parties. The Afffirsvarlden General index added 11.4 to 1,085.5 in turn- over of SKr356m, up from SKr336m. Volvo free B shares rose SKr7 to SKr372 and, in the for- estry sector, Stora A shares gained SKr10 to SKr340. ZURICH ended a fraction higher in moderate trading. The Crddit Suisse index rose 0.4 to 530.1, but the brewer, Feldschl6sschen, saw its bear- ers fall SFr200 to SFr3,150 fol- lowing Tuesday's revelation that it had taken a substantial stake in its rival, Sibra. AMSTERDAM was little changed in thin trading. The CBS Tendency index closed at 92.1, down 0.1. Volmac, the software group, rose F12 or 11 per cent to Fl 20.30. Investors were encouraged by the com- pany's statement that 1992 results would benefit from restructuring efforts. ISTANBUL leapt 5.6 per cent on heavy buying. News that Finance Minister Ekrem Pak- demirli would meet stockbro- kers today also encouraged investors. The 75-share index rose 165.56 to 3,136.25.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor A DRAMATIC setback in British Aerospace shares spoiled a steadier performance from the UK stock market yes- terday. The Â£432m rights issue from the company had been widely expected, but interim profits were worse than antici- pated and the accompanying statement depressed sentiment across the broad range of the market. At first, the market was strongly influenced by the for- tunes of the Aerospace share price, and the FT-SE Index reversed its initial fall to move briefly into plus territory as Aerospace steadied when a UK merchant bank recommended the stock; but optimism was quickly extinguished after City analysts returned from meet- ing the Aerospace board in even more depressed mood, AeXoMt De-sm B1es 8ep 2 Sep 1 Sep 30 Sep 12 Sep 26 Oct 10 Sp Sep 27 Oct 11 Sep23 7 Oct 21 and began to reduce 1982 prof- its forecasts for the company. Aerospace renewed the downturn to close more than 12 per cent weaker on the day at 445p, with market traders worrying over progress of the sub-underwriting of the rights issue, which is priced at 380p a share. The rest of the market dipped by 9.2 on the Footsie, but then rallied as investors turned their attention to the Smodest indications of economic Improvement in the UK reported this week. With elec- tion speculation also cooler for the moment, the equity market was more stable and good qual- ity institutional support was seen in selected areas. By the close, the FT-SE Index had rallied to 2,626.6, with the day's fall reduced to only 4.2 points. Traders reported very modest US sell- ing at the close, with Glazo easing a shade ahead of the profits statement which is due today. The corporate profits report- ing season rolled on, bringing some shocks but also some good news. Cadbury Schwep- pes were favoured on good results and a confident state- ment from the boardroom.

Smiths Industries, which has contracts with British Aerospace, lost 8 to 283p in sympathy with BAe. Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, went into reverse as the market picked up hints that a long-mooted rights issue might soon materi- alise. The shares receded 4% to 55p. British Vita saw good two-way business and hard- ened a penny to 245p with 1.6m shares traded. The buying interest was prompted by a positive note from Kleinwort Benson, while the selling was believed to reflect a stake dis- posal by former chairman Mr Fernley Parker. Waste management company Caird also saw healthy turn- over on the back of interim results above expectations and closed 6 up at 106p on 1.8m shares. Trafalgar House bounced 9 to 238p as investors began to feel that pessimism over the stock was overdone. BTB, which continued to hold pre- sentations for institutions, flrmed 4 to 432p. Dollar strength helped a number of companies with US exposure. Tomkans, which does about 70 per cent of its busi- ness in the US, gained 6 to 412p. Williams Holdings, which is also very active in the US, picked up 5 to 367p. Harrisons & Crosfield retreated 11 to 151p after announcing a fall in interim profits. The fall was expected but some observers inferred point, followed by a slow start to the new session yesterday, let London with little encour- agman1nt on the international -ront. London traders, however, stressed that there has been an improvement in the quality of institutional business this week, which has been some- what obscured by the focus on British Aerospace. Institutions have been more willing to buy for the long term and less Interested in near term trading than for some months past. Matching this has been their unwillingness to sell stock unless presented with an immediate buying alternative. This has brought active switch. ing and emphasised the \"stock selective\" nature of the mar- ket, according to institutional brokers. from the chairman's statement that the full-year dividend would be cut. County NatWest, already a seller of the stock, reduced its full-year estimate by Â£3m to Â£85m. However, Kleinwort Benson feels the stock is an attractive buy for its yield. Jewellery supplier Abbey- crest picked up 13 to 100p in spite of a sharp slide in interim profits. The dividend was maintained and the chairman's statement was positive, but at least one observer felt the rise was overdone and that traders may have been marking up prices to cover short positions. Worsted spinner John Hag- gas continued to gain ground after strong full-year results reported on Tuesday, closing 6 higher at 76p. Calor Group, the bottled gas company, performed well in oils, closing 5 ahead at 233p on high turnover of 1.7m. The rise came as several houses focused on the stock's fundamental attractions and the forthcom- ing interim figures, scheduled for next Thursday. Buy recommendations in a bulky review of the media sec tor from BZW helped some stocks to buck the wider lack lustre trend. Carlton Commu- nications added 6 at 521p.

   "text_content" : "DEFENCE AND industrial group British Aerospace (BAe) tumbled to a 2%-year low after surprising the market with the news that it would make a loss of around Â£85m this year after exceptional items. The news, which came with the release of lower than expected interim profits and the launch of a much-trailered rights issue, started the shares falling. A gloomy analysts meeting completed the setback in the share price. At worst, the shares were down 73 but support at these levels helped them to rally to close a net 63 lower at 445p. Turnover reached 13m shares, the high- est since mid-1988. One analyst was moved to say: \"British Aerospace is dead in the water. We cannot find good news here before 1995.\" Fund managers were said to be shocked by the news. The company cancelled two meet- ings with investors due to be held yesterday afternoon. The rights issue was said to have been well underwritten but there was talk in the mar- ket that underwriters may be left with a sizeable amount of the stock. Analysts have dropped 1992 forecasts by around Â£80m to between Â£200m and Â£240m. Food stocks alert Speculation that Philip Mor- ris may launch a bid for a UK food company intensified yes- terday after the US food and tobacco group confirmed that it has been attempting to raise its credit line by $3bn to $15bn. Once again, attention focused on Cadbury Schwep- pes, which was also lifted by interim results in line with most analysts' forecasts. The shares closed 8 higher at 404p. United Biscuits, the other takeover favourite, added 5 at 400p. Many food specialists, however, wondered whether the UK food companies may be too small for Philip Morris's takeover ambitions. Instead, another US food multinational, such as Quaker, might be ir Morris's sights. Builders fall Costain was among the building sector's worst per- formers, losing 16 at 112p after being as low as 107p, following a 71 per cent drop in half-year profits, and warnings that full- year profits would fall below the 1990 figure of Â£30.5m and the 1991 dividend total could be under threat. Turnover in Cos- tain was a higher than usual 3.6m shares. John Mowlem also reported a steep fall in interim profits, from Â£18m to Â£7m, but the group's shares held up rela- tively well to close only 3 easier at 230p. BZW said the results from both companies \"increase the worry factor about full-year dividends\", and forecast that both companies would pass their final payments. Tate& Lyle put on 4 to 383p on a County NatWest buy recommendation and following confirmation that it had received regulatory approval to sell Sucralose, the artificial sweetener, in Canada. Ranks Hovis McDougall dipped 4 to 290p after Nomura said its prof- its from milling and baking might be squeezed by higher wheat prices. UK farmers have been switching away from mill- ing wheat, and RHM may now be forced to buy more expen- sive wheat from Europe. Iceland Frozen Foods climbed 9 to 399p after the company issued an upbeat statement on the back of strong interim results. Tesco firmed a penny to 280p on hopes of good half-time results next Tuesday. An optimistic statement on profits from the management of Invergordon Distillers left the shares moving erratically. Investors were torn between interpreting the statement as good for the future earnings of the business, in which case they should be buying the shares, or inhibiting a pro- posed takeover by Whyte & Mackay, UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, the US tobacco group. Invergordon shares were ini- tially firm, improving a penny, then weak, falling 10, and finally only slightly down at 266p for a net decline of 3. Turnover came to almost 1m shares. Brent Walker continued its recent and seemingly inexora- ble decline. The shares lost another 2 to lip as a newswire reported Standard Chartered Bank as saying it and other creditor banks had 48 hours in which to find a solution to the firm's restructuring prob- lems. After trading ended, Standard Chartered said. \"Any suggestion that a deadline had thus been imposed is totally incorrect.\" Interim figures from paper and packaging group BunzI took the floor from beneath the shares. The company posted a 32 per cent fall in half-time profits to Â£20.6m and cut 30 per cent from the dividend. The stock dropped 13 to 91p. Rival Bowater seemed to benefit at Bunzl's expense. The shares recovered from recent weakness with an improve- ment of 5 to 675p. Insurance brokers Willis Corroon advanced to 305p before ending a net 6 up at 299p, the market being excited by news that the group had won a contract to place insur- ance coverage for Phillips Petroleum, the US oil group. Dealers said the contract was undoubtedly good news for Willis but that the market had possibly overreacted. GEC, which closed margin- ally easier at 195%/p, featured as one of the market's most active stocks with 12m shares dealt. A line of 3.6m was traded for cash at 203%p, and another line of 3.6m at 196p. Another big turnover, 9.8m shares, was recorded in Racal 'Special Ex', which touched 44%p before closing 1% ahead at 43%.p, with hints of stake- building still well to the fore. BICC declined 5 to 446p after a sell note issued by UBS Phillips & Drew. Rolls-Royce hardened a penny to 140p ahead of today's interim results. Caparo Indus- tries moved ahead 14% to 63p",

   "text_content" : "THE LONDON derivatives market was dominated by the rights issue from British Aero- space and its disappointing interim results, although by the close of trading, equity futures were indicating that the stock market may stabi- lise, writes Jim McCallum. The bad news from BAe appeared to frighten some investors away and caught the market at a particularly vul- nerable point. However, calm returned later in the day and the September FT-SE 100 con- tract's lead over the spot index widened to 22 points, com- pared with 10 at the previous close and fair value of approxi- mately 10. The expansion in Septem- ber's premium suggests that the market may be about to recover its composure, although the greater polit- ical uncertainty makes fore- casting more hazardous than usual, futores dealers said. The September contract fin- ished at 2,646, down 3.5 points on the day. Turnover expen- ded to over 16,000 contracts a one broker rolled over 3,000 contracts from September into December. British Aerospace was the busiest stock option. A buyer of 500 November 500 calls made it the most active series. There was also a seller of 2,700 rT-SE October 2,500 puts."
