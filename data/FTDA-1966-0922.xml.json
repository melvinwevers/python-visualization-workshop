   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter Radio 390 bha been chosen as the first target In the Govern. ment's campaign to remove the pirate radio stations from Britain's shoreline. A summons, alleging unlicensed broadcasting, has been served on Estuary Radio, the 390 bolding company. News of the summons arrived as the station's manag- ing director. Mr. Ted Allbeury, was in the middle of a Press conference and complaining about \"underhand pressures\" being brought against the offshore stations. He intends to continue transmissions. Estuary Radio must now appear at Canterbury magistrates sessions on November 24. The company's first move will be to challenge the rights of the court to exercise jurisdiction over the 390 tower, which is on the Red Sands in thek ThosmnO ab tscII junsaicnuon over we jvu tow( in the Thames estuary. The station is one of three using the abandoned anti-aircraft towers, which the Post Office has long claithed could 'be put off the air without awaiting legisla. tioriL 390's tower was first used by Radio Invicta and was claimed as salvage by Invicta's founder, the -late Mr. Tom Pepper (a noin-deaplume, his real name was Harry Featherbee). The Least \"Pop\" of the Pirates Radio 390 is. the least \"pop\" of the pirates.

   "text_content" : "Our Poltcal Correspondent writes: The serving of similar summonses on the remaining pirate radio stations on forts within British territorial waters is to be considered by the Postmaster- General, Mr. Edward Short. It is expected that he may await the outcome of yesterday's legal action against Radio 390 before finally deciding to proceed against the other stations. But it was stressed last night that earlier action against them could not doefinitely be ruled out at this stage. Legal Problems The question of whether to prosecute the radio pirates under the Wireless Telegraph Act 1949, has been under consideration by the Post Office for many months, According to Whitehall, the delay in Issuing the summons has largely been due to complex legal problems which first had to be clarified-in particular, the defini. tion of territorial waters, and whether the Courts had jurisdiction over, the forts. The penalties are a maximum fine of Â£100 and/or three months' gaol, with provisions for fortfeiture of equipment. The 1949 Act does not extend to pirate stations, such as Radio Caroline, situated outside terrin toral waters, These are beng tackled by the Governments recently published Bill which mong other thingseeks to make Sfor British copanies to adve se on pirate radio servces TO Government expects this Bill to become law net ter. Mr. Short is detrmlned that the new legislation should be comr pletely effective, If the stations still contrived to continue broad- casting after the new Act were In fore-or even after a sucessful summons under the 1949 Act-the Post Office has a number of plans for enforcement. One of these is the demolition of the Thames Estuary forts after eviction of the pirates. Estimates of the cost of demolition have been t prepared, but it is stressed that any decision to destroy the forts, which are Government property, would 5have to be taken by the Cabinet. Also. Mr. Short has said that if, after the new legislation, stations ried to exist on foreign advertisin, the Government might possibly consider banning the sale in this country of goods advertised in this way. Meanwhile, the Government's proposals for a network of popB music programmes to replace those broadcastby the pirate stations are expected to be published within a month, Coming White Paper Work is still being done by Mr. Shprt on his coming White Paper on Broadcasting, whch has still to be approved by the Cabinet. Indooeed,during the last year the Post Omce's proposals have been sent back by the Cabinet several times for modification, and It is believed there has already been some controversy hetween those Ministers who favour a new radio network carrying advertising and . others who have objections to the whole Idea of commercial radio. But the Postmaster-General is understood to take the view that even if the BBC was willing to run a 24-hour pop music programme the cost of flnanoln It would Involve a prohibitive Inonwin the radio icence fee.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "Mr. Bowden and the Attorney-General, Sir Elwyn Jones, had to-day a second meeting with Mr. Ian Smith before he was due to fly to Bulawayo for the Rhodesian Front Congress, which begins to-morrow evening. An ^iAfli.I n^ffi- .f.- _____ an oficial sritish spokiesman said to-night .that the proceq of c0iuultfng a .cross-section of Rho- dsian opinion was expected to take about four diys. Little Information The fact that the British mission is not flying back to London with- in hours of its arrival does not mean that any progress has been made in the discussions with Mr. Smith. On the contrary, from the minimal information available, it seems that the two sides have yet to aroe on central points, such as faciitieac for Mr. Bowden to see African leaders now in restriction. But British thinking appears to be that there is no need to rush things, that the presence of British Ministers in Salisbury is in itself a good thing, and that there is no need to depart before Mr. Smith goes off to BulAwayo, More Contacts The British Ministers have already started making contact with different sectors of Rhodesian opinion, and it seems that this pro* css will be continued while Mr. Smith is out of the capital. Whether they will let near the restricted African leaon ers a differ. nt matter. It is just possible, how- ever, that before Mr. Bowden arrived, there was a tentative indl- cation that this would not be auto- matically impossible., A false stop such as an undiplo- matic speech y Mr. Smith at the Congres, coold, of couhse, destroy these plan and compel Mr. Bow- don to return Immedfately to Lon. don. From Our Diplomatic Correspondent SALISBURY, Sept. 21. The Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Herbert Bowden, will not make a speedy departure from Salisbury, as was expected in some quarters, but will continue his discussions until I ,atleast the weekt-end. All that Rbodesitn and British spokesmen were sayarg to-day was that \"both sides met again thii morning.\" The advantage of so terse a statement was that it did away with farcical quibbling as to whether Mr. Smith was or was not the Rhodesian Prime Minister and whether Mr. Bowden was here in his capacity as Commonwealth Secretary. Police Depot Venue However, the venue of to-day's meeting-it was in the police depot next door to Government House and across the road from Mr. Smith's house-could be seen as a contession by the British Ministers. Mr. Smith is obviously most reluctant to go to Govern. ment House where the British Ministers sit waiting for him. This is the. main reason why half the front page of the Rhodesia Herald was censored this morning, to keep from the Rhodesian public the news that Mr. Smith actually went to call on Mr. Bowden. The censors had their wildest night for months. S. Africa still neutral Page 7",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "By LEX Markets, both equities and gilt-edged, were slightly easier yesterday, the-share index losing 2 points at 304.9 and gilt-edged up to -A. Bargains marked at 6,497 were the lowest since January 17, 1958, when they were 6,416, and the continuing low level of business not unnatu- rally provoked fresh despon- dency. Few S.E. firms can be making their overheads on this sort of turnover. Royal Exchange Royal Exchange, like Royal Insurance, has managed to produce an overall underwriting profit for the first six months despite worse results at home. For the Royal Exchange this is quite an achieve- ment since the U.K. accounts for about half the group business. Moreover, running down the U.S. operation-it now accounts for under 2% per cent. of fire and accident premiums-is expensive and half-time losses there are Â£139,000 higher. An \"appreciable improvement\" elsewhere overseas, however, has done the trick. The interim stays at 7% per cent. The only clue to the underwrit- ing outlook for the year as a whole is that there will be no contribu- tion from the marine and aviation account which in 1965 provided Â£157.000. It would be wrong to .count on a real turn-round on the U.K. motor side, over a quarter of Royal Exchange's total premium income, before 1967 at the earliest when the new post McKinsey rates can make their mark. Nor is the fire outlook at home much brighter. Thus Royal Exchange will still have to rely on relief via Section 85 and franked income to bridge the gap between darnings and the Â£2-46m. gross cost of the dividend. Last year the shortfall was Â£715,000, but with substantial relief. -d some benefit from the 1ni N'loahi stock the dividend could epa up covered. This jnakes sense of the 5.6 per cent, yield. At 66s, but is the 7 per cent. loan '.ock so soundly based at 93%? Ex the options a similar stock would -be worth only 87., or so. The-cost of the option to subscribe for 12 Ordinary at 80s a share in 1970- therefore, is Â£6, pushing up the effective subscrip- tion price to 90s. A premium of 36 per cent. over the current mar- ket price would be hard to stomach anywhere, but in an industry literally hazardous as insurance it is particularly hard to justify. See also Page IS Cavenham Foods Cavenham Poods has safel cleared the first of its hurdles with profit before tax just beating the forecast of Â£166,000. But since it cannot yet gr6up its past losses for tax purposes the tax charge Is 6.1 per cent, lepving earnings a nominal 0.54 per cent. At 6s lI-dtherefore the share prce h s sights firmi fixed on Cavenham'a maiden div dend due tlls year. On the basis of say a 7% per cent, yield, at the present 1 rice level, this dividend would Shave to be 9% per cent, which this year would require profits of around Â£400,000 before a full tax charge, rising to Â£620,000 next year t when the deferred start ranking. In fact Cavenham's minimml acceleration need not be as fast as that since its tax charge should- be sub-normal for the next couple of years as a result of the past losses. Secondly, it is not hard to find the makings of more profits. Confec- tionery manufacturing for one may break even this year against losses of around Â£80.000. and with a turnover of over Â£5m. should be capable of useful profits. Simi- larly, Singleton and Cole could contribute more, its wholesaling profits were only Â£4,000 on a Â£20m. turnover last year. However, with the price freeze and SET, costing the group Â£45,000 net of refunds in a full year, it is difficult to see profits this year rising to much more than Â£300,000. On this basis the tax charge would have to be half the full rate to ensure cover for a 9% per cent. dividend. See also Page 14 Cammell Laird Cammell Laird has wasted, no time in sorting out the shipbuilding and ship repairing losses. Thi fore- cast is this year they will be \"substantially eliminated,\" having been as high as Â£730,000 in 1964 and Â£584,000 last year. In support will be Scottish Aviation, contri- buting for eight months to the tune of Â£100,000 or so before tax. and without a tax charge thanks to past losses. Finally Patent Shaft Steel Works which contributed trading profits of Â£567,000 last year is more than holding its own. Thus the one grey spot is that a drop in investment income is on the way -it totalled Â£871,000 gross last year, against group pre-tax profits of Â£513,000. However the slip on this side is not going to undo the - o work on shipbuilding and protl for to year look hs though the will finish up within strikins dsstance of Â£lm. before tax. This would produce earnings just short as forecast) of the 12 per cent. dvij- dend. which is to be maintained. At 7s 3d to yield 8% per cent. the Cammell price remains un- convinced that the Government will finally stump up and .nationalise steel, taking Cammell's 25 per cent. of English Steel If this ever comes o it could be worth 6s a share, at asset value, to Cammell which leaves the rest of the group in at Is 3d, selling at 4.2 times earnings. Moreover, with the shipbuilding side through its unprofitable orders, and cur another nuclear submarine,- sara. ings should improve. Secondly, the faster they improve n Scottish Aviation the better for there will be no tax charge there for some time, Finally, even If there is no steel money there Is always the chance the group will organis the shipbuilding side into a group get. ting Government appaival-ad financial backing.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent TO MEET THE CRISIS of de- pressed tea prices, the Ceylon Government is understood to be considering assisting tea small- holders by refunding the amount by which their tea prices fall below Rs.1.50 427d) a pound. The maxi- mum refund would be 35 cents, a pound, payable only if the tea fetches over 90 cents a pound. This will prevent sub-standard leabT being put up for sale. At present all teas are subject to an export duty of 35 cents a poun and, additionally, an ad valor'i sales tax equal to 50 per cent. f excess price above Rs.1.85 a-poun h with a ceiling of 70 cents a pound. Smallholders are defined as owners of less than 10 acres who sell their green leaf to factory owners and these prices have fallen to about Id a pound. The Low Country Products Asso- ciation has urged the Government to extend a contemplated relief scheme to owners of larger units .of jid- and low-country teas. They admit that such extension would raise the relief cost from Rs.15m. to Rs.30m. But they claim that failure to extend the aid will lead to estates closing and cause Ceylon COLOMBO. Sept. 21. a loss of Rs.50m. in foreign ex- change. They are also urging the enforcement of minimum standards of quality. Our Commodiies Stall writes a This would not be the first time that Ceylon has operated a scheme of this kind, but its probable introduction emphasises Ceylon's particular sus- ceptibility to the present weaknesses in the tea market. Quality leaf is still selling well. but the plain teas >rc very much in the doldrums. The main reason is that world tea production is well up on last year without the corresponding increase in consumption. Current estimates cal- culate that output is some 50m. pounds ahead of 1965; and the greater part is likely to be in the production of plain teas. The market is also being affected by the economic fortunes of the U.K.. not surprisingly since this country accounts for around a quarter of the world's consumption. The credit squeeze is also encourag- ing many firms to reduce their buy- ing to a minimum and run down stocks. Stocks. furthermore, were built up to abnormally high levels just before the seamen's strike. The particular vulnerability of Ceylon's farmers to world prices stems from the fact that almost all their tea has to be exported. Domes- tic demand accounts for only about 10 per cent. of total production.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staff U.K. CHOCOLATE consumption continues to increase, and reached a weekly consumption rate of 4.1 ozs a head in the first half of this year. This compares with 3.9 ozs in the comparable period of 1965 and 3.7 ozs in 1964. Sugar confectionery, on the other hand. remained static at 3.4 ozs a head each week, a drop of 0.2oz on the 1964 level. The figures, released by the Cocoa. Chocolate and Confec- tionery Alliance, also show that the nation's consumption of these con- fectionery items is now running at the impressive rate of Â£323m. a -year. In addition, exports over the first half of the year amounted to almost Â£10.5m.. a record. However; the indications are that the trade might not be able to look forward to the second half of 1966 with quite the same degree of optimisni. Hopes have been dampened by the, imposition of the regulator, which has pushed up the rate of purchase tax from 15 to 161 per cent. Absorbing these increases is an awkward business in a trade where consumer purchasing is confined generally to small, cheap items. In practice, changes in the rate of taxation involve either cutting margins or redesigning packages. Furthermore, the trade currently believes that domestic demand for chocolate and sugar confectionery is incapable of much further expansion. British weekly consumption per head of about 71 ounces compares with 51 ounces in the U.S. and 5 ounces in Germany. This fact has convinced Cadbury's, largest of the British manufacturers, that future arowth of the company will have to come from outside its traditional specialities like moulded chocolate bars, of which it has a near monopoly in Britain. . GUYANA JOINS FAO Guyana has been admitted as a full member of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation. The FAO now has 110 members and three associate members. It is also announced that formal application for membership has been received from Bulgaria. Its application will he submitted to the next session of the FAO conference late in 1967.",

   "text_content" : "By a Cormpomdent NEXT MONDAY'S conference in Rome of the world's principal dried fruit producers will see a change in emphasis on the main subject for discussion. The future policy on surpluses and a plan for international promotion were to have headed the agenda. but since this was drawn up falls in dried fruit deliveries are expected from all the major exporters except Iran. This has now produced a situation in which the talks will centre more on the immediate shortage rather than on the ex- pected long-term surplus. The delegates to the three-day* conference are the chairmen of th Turkish, Greek. Australian and United States marketing organisa- tions, plus their advisors. This is the World Dried Vine Producers Secretariat's advisory committee- a body formed last year at the secretariat's annual conference in Brighton, but left dormant until this year's Melbourne's meeting demanded that it be brought to life to watch over the International Sultanas Agreement. The committee's main task is to see whether prices set under the agreement are being observed by the countries concerned. Now, rather than acting as a watchdog. next week's meeting may provide the occasion for raising prices- well before the end of the year for which they were to have run when they were fixed in June. The first move in this direction came last week when Greek exporters withdrew offers on the London market and began working on price-increase proposals to take to Rome. Weather Factor Prices at Melbourne were set against a prospect of world pro- duction that would fit comfortably into market requirementS without any of the stresses of over-produc- tion that caused the disastrous pi ice-cutting of a few years ago and led to the introduction of the agreement. However, the picture began to change two months ago when first frost and later rain reduced Turkey's estimated export- able surplus from 90,000 to 50.000 tons. Turkey has a carry-over of 25.000 tons that should enable it to satisfy its normal markets, but there will be nothing to spare. Rain has also changed the position in Greece, where only half the Crete crop has been har- vested and unofficial reports put production at 60.000 instead of 84,000 tons-almost all of it for export. The U.S. crop is smaller than last year's, and although this country holds the world's largest surplus of about 35,000 tons, this too will be cut by a plan for pro- viding free fruit to schools. Aus- tralia, too, will be turning in a lower crop-about 72,000 tons, compared, with last year's 83,000 tons. So output is down in all major producing countries except Iran, where there could hardly have been other than an improvement on last year's failure. Although the agenda, and per- haps even the function of the Rome meeting will be revised by these circumstances, the foundations for it were laid at the Melbourne conference. In itself, that conter- ence did little more than extend for another year the prices estab- lished at the U.K. meeting the year before. But it was significant in that it took place against a back- ground of success for the Inter- national Sultanas Agreement, which the World Dried Vine Pro- ducers' Secretariat was formed four years ago to embody. Price Margin Last year the agreement faced its toughest test since inception, with maximum crops in all coun- I tries but Iran. For a time it looked : as though it might not survive the I pressure of the record tonnages, but I apart from minor breaches by Mediterranean exporters, who gave discounts by misinterpreting rules governing buyers' discounts, its i provisions were loyally kept. The rates set at Brighton and reaffirmed at Melbourne are $325 f.o.b. for No. 9 Turkish and No. 4 - Greek, and $335 for No. 10 Tur- r kish and No. 2 Greek, subject to i buyers' discount of 24 per cent. (which last year, in the hands of some exporters, became 5 per s cent.). I The lower grades-Turkish No. 1 8. Greek No. 5 and Australian Nos. 2 and 3-were allowed still to re- main outside the agreement, and, as has traditionally been the case. Australia undertook to maintain a price margin of Â£2 a ton above the rate set for each grade covered by the agreement. Australia also volunteered this t year to offer not more than 18,000 tons of fruit in the U.K. between s July I and December 30. consist- 3 ing of 15,000 tons of new crop and 3,000 tons of old-about Aus- e tralia's normal selling between , those months. She further agreed, in view of a lower crop this year. to limit sales to Germany to 6,500 ) tons. Finally, she undertook to f keep a reserve, not necessarily in t Australia, of 8,000 tons until the t end of the year. Whatever the-industry's immed- e iate preoccupations, the long-term y problems remain, and it was agreed that surpluses should be t reviewed more often. Now that f stability has been reached on r prices, it is like baling a boat with r holes in it unless understanding is s also achieved on production con- it trol. s Australia's dried fruit acreage i- is pegged, even though yields are i- tending to rise through greater a efficiency. America proposes to 5, limit its grape output for all pur- 0 poses, including wine, but there is ir no restrictio.. of production in the i, Mediterranean countries. Although somewhat longer-term than to-day's immediate needs, a part-solution to the problem is contained in proposals by the chair- man of the Australian. Dried ii Fruits Board. Sir Eugcne Gorman, to sell surplus fruit cheaply to needy countries. Discussion of this in Melbourne was complemented by a report to the conference on talks between Australian and other governments involving the same sort of objectives for not only dried fruit but a range of commodities. The Rome meeting will also dis- cuss promotion. The Secretariat's permanent committee in London has been asked to furnish: reports to the meeting on proposals for at least some pilot promotional cam- paigns in certain European e markets. This is something pro- ducers have been nibbling at for years but not yet got their teeth into internationally. Australia and the U.S. have been spending some money promoting in certain export markets in addi- tion to their domestic ones; how- ever, there are large areas that remain neglected by everyone- notably on the Continent. Big Markets? France and Italy are two poten- tially big markets that are begin- ning to enter the Secretariat's promotional reckoning. France. . with 50m. people, consumes less dried fruit than Eire, with 2m., and Italy accounts for only twice as much as France. Compared with these and other i European possibilities, Britain, already a high per capita consumer I of dried fruit, offers little hope for further expansion and it is likely that promotion here has just about I reached its limits. No country has i the funds to make a world-wide - promotional impact for its produce, I but it is thought that collective effort could be effective in certain i markets. Such co-operation would not be without difficulties. Australia. for example, already sells on the Con- tinent. but whenever the volume k rises the Mediterranean countries : complain that she is invading their traditional outlets-a possessiveness - that is reflected in the request that f' I Australia limit its sales to Germany 3 this year. Nor is the solution to a such problems likely to lie in the t adoption of quotas, for such 1 measures are regarded suspiciously. 1 Meanwhile, even without the col- s lective promotion on which the - Secretariat is bent, much market development is going on. Australia 5 is exploring Nationalist China, the e Americans have opened up big new r outlets in Japan, and Greece. and ) Turkey have worked up trade with . Russia-which would be more still s if they could get hard currency for c their fruit instead of having to barter.",

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff GOVERNMENT legal aid for the poor-denounced a year ago by some bar associations as \" socialised law \"-has clearly been a great success. Programmes of b legal aid are now under way in the 12 largest cities in the U.S. and in 37 of the 50 largest cities. Altogether, 163 legal services programmes in 43 states are in operation and, according to a report published by the Office of Economic Opportunity (which conducts the war on poverty), t S27m. was spent on the scheme during the past fiscal year. This compares with SSm. spent Iby voluntary legal aid societies in the same period. The OEC is unable to estimate Just t how many poor people have benefited a fraomthe Igul servoes programme. b Sqlar as Washington, DC, is con. i WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. ,e cerned 25 lawyers. working out of y eight offices located throughout the district, handled 7.747 cases during the S fiscal year. Officials regard this as n typicaf of the demands made on the if services. A rapid expansion of the pro. e gramme seems unlikely because of the a present inadequacy of funds. Many of the programmes now in existence were funded only in May or June and will need sharply rising amounts dur. \" ing the coming months. Some officials a reckon that with at least 100 more f programmes now in the pipeline at h least $SSSm. will be required during l, the current fiscal year. e It is extremely doubtful thatCon- s gress willgive the programme this amount. Neither chamber has corn. y pleted action on the anti.-overty C programme yet, but the Senate has recommended a limit of S50m. and ;t the House said that \" at least $23m.\" I should be spent. A compromise between these two amounts seema likely.",

Mr. Andrei Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister, is being watched with un- usual interest in Whitehall for any .signs of progress on the Vietnam issue. Mr. Arthur Goldberg, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, who will be taking part in the meeting, said in a recent TV appearance:. \"We would like to invite the Soviet Union's good offices and its sense of responsibility in getting the Vietnamese war to a nego- tiated and honourable settlement\" He also said he would like to achieve a proper. UN role in bringing about a solution, and predicted that Vietnam would be in the forefront of discussion in and around the meeting of the General Assembly, which opens this week. Britain has a particular interest because, with Russia, she is co- chairman of the Geneva Con- ference, which could become the instrument for a settlement. When Mr. George Brown, the Foreign Secretary, goes to the UN to address the Assembly on October 11, he may well find that there is a useful part for him to play.",

PRESIDENT Johnson told a Press conference to-day that he has asked his Council of Economic Advisers to study the announcement by the Ford Motor Company that it was raising the prices of its 1967 model by an average of $112. The President commented: \" We had hoped these businessmen could forego the necessity of increasing prices. We asked them to do that, but they were free to make their own prices, and that is what they have done. Mr. Walter Reuther. president of the United Auto Workers' Union, to-day branded the Ford decision to raise prices as \"shocking and scanda- lous' and called for a Congressional probe of the motor industry.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1966_0922_0003_008",
   "text_content" : "By Our W dhtngt\" Caemupondat I PREMLIMINARIES atn over, the battleanes are drawn. And for the next seven weeks the United States submerges itself in that astonishiang .mitur of earnest truth-eeking, .oldd-blooded calcu. lation and brilliant ballyhoo which make up an American election campaign. An election in a non- presidential or \"off\" year such as this lacks the ultimate glamour, it is true. Nonetheless the stakes are very high. Considered even from the point of view of the individual office. seeker the scale of the operation is grandiose beyond almost any BEuropean standards. The Gover- nor 'of California, for instance, who will be elected this autumn at the same time as 36 other governors. will be in control of a State budget of S4.OO0m. The prestige and political patronage of a U.S. Senator is such that Mr. Robert Kennedy reportedly spent upwards of S2m. to get elected in New York in 1964-and even the least important of the 34 senators defending their seats this year is bound to spend at least $100.000 on his campaign. All 435 mem- bers of the House of Representa- tives are up for re-election and very few of them or their opponents will spend less than S40,000 on publicity, travel and organisation. Senate Secure Looked at from a slightly more exalted point of view--ay, that of President Johnson or the Con- gressional Leaders--the election on November 8 is even more impor- tant. The Governors' races, cer- tainly, do not directly affect the main centre of power and the present top - heavy democratic majority in the Senate cannot possibly be upset. But the House of o Re resentav i .h. p es r s anot er matter. There are now 295 Democrats in the Hopuse to 140 ,epbblica.t; But this appearance of overwhelming auperioiyt.foCh Pridant's part is spri i0us.. pproxmately =oAservauyc Dem ocrats from th , Sotethertf. 'jSSWM. can. 0uly rieleon t oh't e wIth th, d Spul I&m'n ay exensons of Federal i or against clviv rights Iegslaation. This fact reduces the dministration's workin majorit 4tm out 3S. A gain of 18 seats bhe Republici would therore in eory elminate this majority. But since this calculation makes no allowance for Republican sains fronV Soitheta Democrats a growig possibility now that the Democrtic stranglehold gn the South is being broken) .most of the pundits are agreed that a gain of more than 30 seats by th= Republicans would be needed to tip the balance. If this happened, the task of pushing through the legislation needed to build the great society would become intolerably difficult and President Johnson might well be reduced to the impotence and frustration which President Kennedy was forced to endure throughout his presidency. Opinion Polls Withdrawing to an even loftier and more philosophical vantage point, one might legitimately take a still more serious view of the campaign. For it is beginning to look as if nothing less than the continued existence of the Repub lican Party--and hence of the fwo Party System in America-is at stake. In 1940, when the pollsters began their investigations, about an equal percentage of Americans regarded themselves as Republicans and Democrats. To-day, because of social change and political mis. management, the Republicans can claim the allegiance of only 26 per cent. of the electorate against the Democrats' 48 per cent. and the independents' 26 per cent. in Fortunately for tem the lut immediate omens are fairly encour- ng aging. At the local level the new Democratic C mssmen, like all Sfirt-term nerable by virtue of of seniority, itblicity or notoriety. It is true What these freshmen Democrats are or a particularly good vintage but, vi other things being equal, local ;es issues and personalities could be ng expected in an off-year to unseat 18 perhaps ten of them. In fact, of Lid course, things are not equal at all lit and the climate of the country in on general is favourable to the opposi- an tion. For the main public issues of its the campaign are bound to be the he Vietnam war and the cost of liv. he ing, and neither of these is likely of to help the Democrats. in he Doves Weeded Out Id, The less politically troublesome, he strangely enough, will probably be at the war. Although it produces acute ly uneasiness on all sides-and so to Mn some extent favours the \" outs \"- he the Republicans have been no more ch successful and certainly no more to consistent than anyone else in sug- gesting a politically workable and honourable solution. The public mood favours the \"hawks\" but since most of the outright \" doves \" er have been weeded out of the oe Democratic side in the primaries oe there is little to choose between he the two parties. to The economic question is also be pooh-poohed by the Administra- b- tion. What, they ask, is a 3 per o. cent. annual increase in prices at compared with the fantastic rs general prosperity of the coun- in try? Even the slump in the stock as market, they say, can hardly be as blamed on the Government. This se may be logically sound and three is- months ago it might even have in been conclusive, but it ignores the er psychological effect of the Gov- ie ernnent's shifts-the long periods it of inaction and bland confidence interspersed with sudden dire warn- ings to business and labour about the dangers of inflation-and the feeble impression created by the latest half-hearted tax measures. Against these difficulties, the Democrats can set an outstanding record of legislation-from free medical care for the old to the war Johnson predicts a draw. on poverty-for which large num- bers of electors have good reason to be grateful. But the trouble is that President Johnson is a difficult man to feel gratitude for. He has gained respect but little affection and while the extent of his pre- sent unpopularity is much over- rated it is true that he is no longer in himself an electoral windbreaker which can shield weak Democratic candidates from the prevailing chilly draughts. One other issue is bound to affect a number of results. The racial problem is being treated with half-hearted statesmanship by the leaders of both aides and neither party seems likely as a whole to makemuch gain byit. In the mind of liberals, the Democrats still carry the taint of Southern bigo- try and the Republicans are sad. died with the memory of Gold- water's bid for the white race'a vote in 1964. From the conser- vative point of view, both parties can be criticised for containing liberals who insist on supporting the desegregation of bousin Nevertheless after this summer' riots and the furore over the hous. ing issue the individual candidate who takes an illiberal line is likely to be a net gainer. Striking a balance out of all these factors is naturally the favourite pastime of the moment. President Johnson has predicted a draw. Senator Dirksen, the Repub- lican Party's professional optimist, has gone overboard for a 75-seat swing to his side. Most experienced soothsayers split the difference and believe the Republicans may gain between 25 and 35 house seats- some in the South but mainly in the traditionally Republican areas of the Mid-West and West. Hopelessly Split A victory of this size would, of course, solve none of the Repub- lican Party's long-term problems. Having no magnetic leader to bear its standard, hopelessly split between conservatives and liberals and still refusing to look for a new power base, its future would remain very uncertain. But at least it would still be a live and credible political organisation. On the other hand a loss of this magnitude would be serious for the President. It would reduce his political base for the 1968 presiden- tial campaign and it would make it hard for him to maintain the repu- tation as a legislative miracle worker which is his chief and some will say his only electoral asset.",

Administration would spend in d this fiscal year. \"As soon as we L know what it is going to cost to b run our Government, we will take s appropriate action very shortly.\" a The Administration consis- tently maintains that no decision on a tax increase can be made until two factors are clearer- .e amounts appropriated by Congress and spending on the Vietnam war. The first is, at present, out of the r Administration's hands (and the e President is clearly fretting at the delays on Capitol Hill); on the e second the President to-day was as d unforthcoming as his Cabinet. g He did not know what the WASHINGTON, Sept- 21. ie demands of Vietnam were going to Le be, although the Defence Depart- a ment had the matter under con- e stant review, the President in- o sisted.

SIXTEEN unions representing 9,000 employees of Alcan Alumi nium in the province of Quebec are seeking a new round of wage negotiations with the company, al- though their current contracts do not expire for another 15 months. The unions, all affiliated with the Quebec-based Confederation of National Trade Unions, say the cost of living has risen consider- ably since the current contracts were accepted in November. 1964, and that wages therefore are of less value. Discussions on wage demands at this stage of a contract term have never been held at Alcan. The average hourly rate for employees of Alcan facilities at Arvda is $2.85. I",

C h il r y al iy Jt P IC IC r- d It n Is It It n 'I The fifty-seventh annual general meeting of the British Industries and General Investment Trust Limited was held yesterday in London. MR. P. L. FLEMING (the chair- man). who presided, said:- Gentlemen, you will see that the gross dividends and interest showed an increase over last year of. Â£35.000. About half of that in- crease was due to the earlier pay- ment of dividends by companies who wished to take advantage of the provisions of the Finance Act, 1965; about a quarter of the in- crease was due to our having had a full year's use of the Debenture money that we raised nearly two years ago; and the last quarter of the increase was a genuine real in- crease in the shape of higher divi- dends and improved yields on changes of investments. Against this we have had no divi. dend from the Subsidiary company which paid us Â£10,000 the year before. This is almost entirely due to a large investment in Shell, for which I am afraid I must take per- sonal responsibility. I thought, and I think a lot of people thought, before the General Election of 1964 that Shell was one of the few companies that was almost immune from any political action, particu- larly from our own Government. I was just too ingenuous to imagine that any Government could have done to our foreign assets what it did in the 1965 Finance Act. We are getting over that situation in the Subsidiary but obviously this is quite a cold climate in which to make money out of share dealing business. which is what the Sub- sidiary does. The Dividend The only other interesting thing in the accounts is our recommenda- tion of a dividend of 12 per cent. out of earnings of 18.8 per cent., compared with 12 per cent. out of 17.6 per cent. last year, We had, as you know, announced our intention of recommending a dividend of 14 per cent, Then we were asked-I think this is the correct jargon-to effect a redeployment of the extra 2 per cent. My view is that we really had no option but to do that. After all. industrialists are being compelled to break promises that they have made to their employees, and I do not think that we. who do not employ unionised labour, have any rIght to out loose and do what we ike, It is not going to make their job any less difficult, One has got to remember that in the end it is to those in Industry, whether on the factory floor or In the hoard room, that we look for the dividends Ohlch constitute most of our income, As to tile future, business in this country is subject to control and inlerference by people who have a theoretical knowledge of eco- nomics and are trying to gain some practical experience at the country's expense, an experiment. I believe, In Further Education which will probably have to be paid for mainly by investors, be- cause that is what, In these days. Investors are for, So far as we can calculate, we should do about as rwll In the current year but you will realse as well as I da that it is really anybdy's guess.

The challenge of rising costs, of extended delivery dates for and shortages of basic materials, and the scarcities of adequate labour has been met successfully and the Company has continued to deliver its Contracts on schedule and to maintain its reputation for com- pletion of work on time. It is estimated that there is sufficient work on hand to maintain the present rate of turnover for, at least, some 15 months. Having commented on the pro. gress of David Ker Property Co.

It is hoped that they will be completed this year. In the present difficult times any attempt to forecast long-term pros- pects must contain a substantial * element of guesswork but looking to the near future it appears that profits from the current year should be no less than those now presented.

Hayward The past year has been difficult for industry-but probably the financial industries have had more than their share of problems. However, we have been able, despite continually increasing Bank interest rates, to record yet another advance in profits even if it is only a small one, and consequently yet another record in this Company's history. This Group is poised for expansion and it has been therefore doubly hard to have to turn away good new business because of the call for restraint made upon us by the Bank of England with its 105% limit on advances. Unfortunately, this restriction continues until further notice but when restraints are lifted we are fully confident of both our ability to expand and to profit from it. Leslie Bilsby Developments Ltd., in which we have a sub- stantial trade investment, had a most successful year though part of the profit arising was of a non-recurring nature. This Company is particularly concerned with housing development, so for the time being the sales prospects are strictly circumscribed. Although we have still not advertised for deposits, they rose during the past year by more than Â£Em. to.Â£2im.

Vao n, the hapless Minister of Defence, but the majority of 36 was less than it might have been. The whole course of the debate demonstrated the coalition Parties' lack of enthusiasm for the man they were supposedly defending. ------ The whole course of the dc Parties' lack of enthusiasm for defending. Herr F. J. Strauss, chief speaker for the Christian Democrats, spoke up for the Bundeswehr as an insti- tution, had for Herr Karl Gumbel, the top Civil Servant in the Defence Ministry. He studiously avoided giving any praise to the person of the Minister. Herr von Hassel's Ministerial life will be a poor risk in the Cabinet shuffle which must come sooner or later. Under his control the Ministry has proved unable to end the long series of Starfighter crashes. More than 60 of these fighter aircraft have been lost. It slithered into the so-called \" revolt of the generals,\" two of whom resigned in August. The loss of the sub- marine Hai last week will probably give rise to further searching criticism. Catalogue For the Social Democrats, Herr Helmut Schmidt rapped out a scath. ing catalogue of charges against the Minister. Quoting chapter and verse, he said that information about the n for the man they were supposedly eaker aviy of the Starfighter problem had been withheld from Dr. Erhard., Ipoke Herr von Hassel, he claimed, had insti- tolerated intrigues in his Ministry, mbel, red tape and a form of organisation t which made it impossible to pin down the who was responsible for what. ously His gravest charge was that Herr the von Hassel had allowed himself to be voo run by civil servants, at their head be a Herr Karl Gumbel the State Secre- luffle tary.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Corpomndent PARIS, Sept. 21. PAUL REYNAUD. the noted French parliamentarian and war. time leader, died here this morning at the age of 87. He entered public life in 1919 and for the next 40 years occupied a central position on the French political stage, serving in many Governments before, during and after the war. In retrospect, his career seems notable, perhaps first and foremost, for the help and encouragement he gave to Charles de Gaulle. In 1935 he embraced and pushed through, despite heavy opposition, the military reforms do Gaulle himself had advocated, though he was then only an obscure army officer. And later, during the darkest days of the war, he gave de Gaulle his first taste of political life by making him an Under-Secretary for War. But Reynaud was also important as the leader of that section of the French Government which refused to treat with the victorious German armies at any price in 1940 and wanted to continue the struggle from overseas if necessary. Defeated by his opponents in the Cabinet, he resigned and spent the rest of the war in detention on various trumped-up charges. Reynaud returned to politics after the war and played a leading role in the European movement, particularly in connection with the founding of the Council of Europe and the Coal and Steel Community. Disillusioned by the chaos of French political life under the Fourth Republic, he wel. comed General, de Gaulle's assump. tion. of power and his handling of the Alenrian crisis. But the two men subsequently fell out over Europcan and Atlantic uetions, the rising cost of the, rench nuclear force and the General's high-handed attitude to. wards Parliament. _1- ~'--~----~",

The British view is that the state of sterling is no longer such as to justify holding up Britain's efforts to join the Common Market; although obviously much remains to be done to the economy, this holds good whether the U.K. joins the EEC or not. If the French continue to take a different view, it is thought in White- hall to be a mistake for Britain to be ie seen waiting for a sign from France s. before makng the next move. Indeed, t. to do so would be to concede General de Gaulle's point that France is the in arbiter of Europe. r .But Britain is likely to carry on le with a further stage of diplomatic ly probing rather than making any startling initiative; for example Mr. le George Brown, the Foreign Secretary.

   "text_content" : "By Our Sdleandfic Corresmpondent TjfiMOST ?rXIbBLE result of t.lj%5th annlvessary celebrations MOthe UO0m. a y Ma PhilipS orga nlution, which will continue in Eindhoven in one form or another till the end of the month, will be the Â£3m. Evoluon. This building has- been described by one spokes- man as aa industrial exhibition and by another as an attempt to portray the impact of technology on man and the influece of man on Thse different versions of what this 21,000 ton copcrete space ship -or as irrevereint staff members call it \"the company mushroom\" -is intended to convey reflects to a very large extent the very divided opinions as to whether .this large sum should ever have been spent in this way. It is easy to suggest other outlets for these funds, but this would be to ignore the fact that of all the giant companies, Philips has by far the most paternalistic outlook in the way it handles staff relations and in the manner in which it expands overseas, particularly in the developing countries. One of the most interesting features of the exhibits inside the building is a section devoted to the company's mistakes in the form of projects that took shape, cost a large amount of money in some instances, only to fail either before launching or through lack of customer interest. It will be a lesson that is un- likely to be wasted on the many thousands of students who will visit Eindhoven in the future, a large percentage of whom will come from the countries whose in- dustries are only just coming into being. In many of these, the company has already set up a manufacturing activity. But the special problems of the cheap labour and costly capital there, poles apart from those which prevail in Europe, have been treated in such a novel way by the company that United Nations' interest has been aroused and a number of study teams have observed and are still examining the results. The basis of the new manufac- turing concept is that while it may appear logical to turn to the big domestic plant to seek guidance when setting up a new venture in West Africa, say, the difficulty is that advice tendered .will be given. with a big factory mentality. Furthermore, what appears logical with a labour force of 5000 trained operators just will not work at a remote site with a hand. ful of skilled men. The radical solution adopted by the company .has been a sort of large-scale \"do-it-yourselff\" pro. ject. Called the Pilot PlAnt and located at Utrecht, it was chosen in site conditions that would make it incapable of expansion beyond its original capacity. It was also sited away from the main manu- facturing lines to compel staff there to rely on their own initiative. For the last four years, a small staff has been revising all the pro- duction methods used in large continuous operation plants to bring them within the capabilities of semi-skilled labour with a non- industrial tradition. This has involved the most ingenious im- provisation and the development of certain simple tools which can be used for many purposes. The Pilot Plant is working through a three-stage plan, the first section of which is the assembly of apparatus from com- ponents made outside Utrecht (that is \"imported \"). Stage 2 includes the assembly of com- ponents from piece-parts made outside and covers both radios and TV sets. Stage 3 includes the manufacture of components from taw materials. A position about half-way in stage 2 has now been reached but the company is already offering the cumulative experience of small factory organisation gained this hard way to overseas'io1untrifL This is done either by providing a ready-made assembly' :lli in a preadly simplified form for easy local maintenance and by training local personnel, or by the. circula- tion of publications. The oompany prefers to train overseas staff on the spot. At present, it is involved in establishing an electronics industry-generally starting with radios-in 25 of the dveloping countries. During 196. of the Â£900m. of capital employed, 35 per cent. was in the Netherlands, 48 per cent. in Europe, 12 per cent. in Western hemisphere countries and 5 per cent. in the rest of the world covering most of the emer- gent areas. The company's effort there does not stop at TV sets. On the con- trary, the whole electronics infra- structure is sketched out, preferably for groups of countries, and cover- ing telecommunications and profes- sional equipment as well as medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. There can be little doubt in com- pany's economists' minds as to whether this is the right way to go about expansion since they fore- cast a 60 per cent. increase to over 2,000m. in the population of the developing countries by 1980, coupled with a 115 per cent. in- crease in their gross national pro- duct to Â£128.000m. They forecast a vast expansion in demand for consumer goods, in- cluding electronic products in the broadest sense and put private con- sumption in the area at Â£91,000m. or well over double the figure recorded for 1960.

The following is an extract from his circulated statement: Having regard to the effect of Government measures, which not only severely curtailed the number of housing starts but also created a complete lack of confidence in the whole economy, the pre-tax profit of Â£221,244 cannot be viewed as unsatisfactory. An amount of Â£103.592 has been provided for taxation leaving a nett profit of Â£117,652 as against Â£195,384 for the previous year and Â£98.706 for the year ended 30th April, 1964. Your Directors recommend a final dividend of 6% making a total for the year of 18% (same). The Price Walker Group loss of Â£38,035 has been included in the figures before arriving at the pre- tax profit above. Whatever description may be given to the measures which have been taken by the Government, in practice they still amount to the Stop-Go\" policies of previous Governments. In our trade it is imphsable to \"turn off the tap\" immediately the Government intro- duoes new curbs. Equally it takes dtime to turn it on again when the signal has turned from Stop to Go. I am pleased that the Manage- ment of your various Companies have a flexibility of mind which should enable them to cope with these changes. Nevertheless,. it must be realised that we cannot: contract out of the difficulties which beset us as a result of national economic problems. The report was adopted.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Scientific Editor OXFORD. Sept. 21. The industrial-diamond industry could increase immensely, even a thousand-fold in the future, accord- ing to Dr. H. B. Dyer of the Dia- mond 'Research Laboratory at Johannesburg, speaking to me here Thi vast increase could come from the entry into the steel indus- try of tools involving diamonds coated with metal and embedded in resins (see New Materials for Industry Page 10). The start would come with spe. cial alloy stesh, because of costs. Thus diamond tools, with their reatly improved technological advanc of rement years, would take the place of conventional grlading materials. The industry at present Is .worth some Â£35m. a year to primary pro- ducers. Â£30m. from D Beers and an estimated Â£5m. from the General Electric Company (U.S.A.). Dr. Dyer was talking on the occasion of the International In. dustrial Diamond Conference here, sponsored by De Beers Consoll. dated Mines. More than 1,000 people have attended from some 30 countries.

This machine has been developed by the Authority's Establishment at Harwell and is to be made and marketed by Kerry's (Ultrasonics), of Hitchin. In Russia according to Prof. Bakul, speaking here this morning, the use of synthetic diamonds is ten times as great as it was five years ago, Russia now stands second in the world to the U.S. in this use of synthetic diamonds. To-morrow Mr. A. C. Nesbitt, also of the Diamond Research Laboratory of South Africa. will give a detailed account of getting diamonds from under the sea. a",

MOISE TSHOMBE, the former Congolese Prime Minister now in Madrid, was yesterday accused of recruiting mercenaries with a view to a second secession of Katanga, at a Press conference in London by Mr. Marcel Lengema, President Mobutu's rov- ing ambassador. Mr. Lengema also hinted that the prospectsfor a settlement in the \" contentieux\" between Belgium and the Congo had im- proved, as a result of a 10-day visit to Brussels just completed by Mr. Justin Bomboko, the Congolese Foreign Minister, who has seen M. van den Bocynants and M.

Mr. Lengema was anxious to separate the question of Belgian State holdings -from that of Belgian private interests.

That leaves Iceland, the greatest anonmaly of them all. for those who want to go pony-trek- king across the icy hinterland or indulge in some very expensive salmon-fishing. Ripe Harvest But it is in some of the Sterling Area countries outside Europe that the ripest harvest from the recent restrictions is expected to be reaped. No one seriously considers that swarms of British tourists will descend on the Gulf States or on Burma, but Jordan is certainly hoping to come into its own. Luckily, the country's planners turned their attention to tourism some time ago, but unless there is a distinct acceleration in the development of hotels, etc., the Tourism Authority in Amman is going to find itself facing some very knotty problems. The basic dilemma is one of logistics. The number of visitors to, Jordan has increased so fast over the last few years-200,000 in. 1962 to 500,000 plus last year -that hotels, roads, services, etc., have not been able to keep pace. m5 Thert are at present .bout 70 see hotels of the standard considered pie suitable for tourists. most of these of being naturaly, in Amman and Jeu.salem. The Tourism Authority Shopes to double, this aure by the al end of 1970. and is dqlng all it ea. can to interest foreign companies )se to.build and operate hotels. -nd The terms, Indeed, are generous. i A company that wants -to set up a ter hotel that costs more than Â£75,000 ver pays no income-tax or customs eir dues for three years, and income- es. tax at half-ratefor two more years. to The Government will often take up to 80 per cent: of the capital. ive and the repatrlation of profits and pe dividends is guaranteed. m. The Jordanian Government is an clearly worried about the lack of ish htel accommodation, Ã½which can. UL of Course, mean higher profits for tr the individual hotelier, (thu Jeru. en salem Intercontinental is. said to or be the most profitable of all Inter- ,l conitinentals.) But the lack of wuJll.ilnstaaa.I out te iack or unacr~usea.. to be unworkable. but that it was Â·Â·;Â·:j~-.:p-.:cÂ·;P .-.\" r,.-di,~ .:Â·.i-:Â·:Â·::Â·Â· ..:Â·::r':\":;..;r~,:\"Â·~Â·:Â·-Â·Â·Â·::Â·Â·Â· :\" .iÂ·-Â·; Â·i~Â· .i~:\"::Â·-';; Â·Â·Â·Â·r~@~Â·l:Â·~Â·ri~ :Â·~ .Â·-Â·rÂ· Â·ir8i:,Â·Â·. A group of Beds at Wadi Ru, in the southern desert. The hils rising straight out of the desert are typical of the area; a similar formation contains the hidden rock-city of Petra. Â·\"'\"(' adequate copmunications is an equally disturbing factor. Take the case of Petra and Aq1abai thesou'4fpf the country. The aniient rockcity of Petra, and the Aqaba resort on the Red Sea -;magnifcent fishing, diving, bath* ing, etc.-are natural tourist magnets, and this the Government has recognised. But they are very uncomfortable to get to. Driving from Amman takes about four hours to Petra and five to Aqaba -all through the hot southern desert. There are plans to improve the road. to complete the last 70. mile section of the railway, to extend the airport at Aqaba, to operate a bhelicopter' service, and so on. 'Some of these have been abandoned as highly impractic. able, others are still under con- sideration. This sort of decision takes months, even years, in the Middle . East.. and all the time valuable tourist areas are being under*used.. B The Government is also guilty p of the piecemeal approach, best p d illustrated by the abortive Project F F. of the Chariots. The Government tl d was concerned about the handling ii a of Petra, where the regular s 1* approach to the hidden city is o it to ride a horse through a long f it defile. This was considered un- y suitable, and uncomfortable, for u g more elderly tourists, so the c r Government dreamed up the idea i< a of using chariots. They had ( s reckoned without the people who C e own and operate the horses, how. c I. ever. Some 250 families more or e i less make their living from this l; carriage (16s for a foreigner, 10s l; I for an Arab). and they objected tl strongly to the prospect of Â£ :- mechanisation in the form of t i- chariots, which would carry two J i tourists per horse rather than one. C e So the scheme had tb be e dropped. Now the error was not g that the proposed plan turned out t to be unworkable. but that it was * ,*** ~ ~:** ~Â·.. .* wWB^Kft^. i- peripheral to Jordaa'& tourls problems. The real trouble wltls2 Pctra is that there is no good ho there. 26,000 people visit the siltl in a year. but very few, of them!, stay overnight. The place is cryingl out for a large hotel, and has been a for years. But if the Government's policies up to now have lacked an overall-\" coherence, there are signs that thisÂ»< is beginning to change. The Government is certainly aware of,\" the vast tourism potential of the' country. and also of its sheer' economic value. Tourism, even last year, was Jordan's second largest foreign exchange earner: the net income last year was Â£5.64m., after the Â£9m. in remit- tances sent from the 40.000 Jordanians working in Kuwait and the 30,000 in Saudi Arabia. Jordan could probably earn twice this amount now, and three or four times in a few years. A Tourism Authority official mut- tered darkly to me about \"the Beirut middlemen.\" who take a large percentage of what the tourist spends on his holiday by organis- ing tours, etc., from a head office in Beirut, London, Paris, or indeed any major city. This is not peculiar to Jordan. of course, but the Jordanians feel that they lose more than most by not having enough of their own well-established agencies. Casino du Liban Despite the under-developed, and at times downright amateurish, nature of the tourism amenities in Jordan, the country still has as much, if not more, to offer the European as any Middle Eastern country. It will be surprising if more U.K. citizens do not take advantage of its positioq in the Sterling Area in the coming months. You can fly there by stages, or direct. KLM, for in- stance, with rare timing, in- augurated a direct flight to Amman just three months before the new currency restrictions were an- nounced. And if anyone still has a hankering to use some of that Â£50 allowance outside the Sterling Area, why not drop in at the Casino du Liban on the way home?",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE FRENCH Government to-day bowed before the wave of indepen- dence riots which swept Djibouti at the time of General de Gaulle's visit last month and decided that its tiny African enclave would be invited to determine its own future by referendum before July 1 next year. Announcing this, the Minister for Overseas Departments; General Pierre Billtte, said the choice before Djih uti was essentially between tbailding its future with FPrioe er without her. To opt for independence, he said. would be an adventure, since the territory, which had up to now been treated as an integral part of France, must not expect France to continue financial, technical and military aid. until it had shown itself capable of acting as a truly independent State. However, it seems quite certain that Djibouti will not, in practice. be given the brutal choice between continuing the status quo or making a clean break that France put before her other African ,possessions in 1958. General Billotte said the exact terms of the referendum would have to be worked out with local political leaders and indicated that PARIS. Sept. 21. the French Government might accept a solution giving Djibouti greater autonomy rather than full independence, if this was what the population wanted. He emphasised that France had no desire to remain in Djibouti. \"either by force or trickery,\" but pointed out the difficulties surrounding a withdrawal when the territory was disputed by Somalia and Ethiopia. Finally. the-Minister alluded to the broader international aspects of the question, and said that the recent riots should be seen in the context of the search f6r a new equilibrium in that part of the world following the U.K. Government's decision to withdraw from Aden.",

British fashions sell well and the building boom gives good oppor- tunities for British furniture and fabrics and for \"do-it-yourself\" tools. Consumer Goods Perhaps the most fruitful new opportunities to be seized right away, the report suggests, are in the West German market for con- sumer goods. With rising pros- perity, demand for foreign goods -even if they are more expensive -is growing. The U.K. is also increasing its sales of many things the Germans are famous for making themselves. from toys to scientific instruments. \"It is important that British firms should not neglect some areas of the market from an out-of-date reluctance to carry coals to New- casta.\" It is pointed out that West Ger- manY importsof goods-Â£6,300m. in 1965 aainst total exports of Â£6,40mO-a-have been rising faster than her home output. Her mnports were equal to nearly 16 per cent. of home output last year, compared with 12 per cent. in 1950. But well over a third of all her trade is with her EEC partners, who together supply half her imports I of manufactures. Her imports I from the EEC have risen much faster than those from EFTA. and > are now about twice as great in r value. The chief hurdle British exports have to face is the EEC's external Â· tariffs and the increasing preference enjoyed by exports to West Ger- many from other EEC countries. The DEA concludes that in the main, West German tariffs are going up towards the new common level. and adds: \" While this will certainly make many sales, such as t those of cars, more difficult so long as we are outside the EEC, at should not prevent many of our exports continuing to do well if we 5 sell them hard. \" In many fields, from consumer goods to machinery, quality, design and early and reliable delivery can outweigh tariff disadvantages. Fairly Equal f As a result of Britain's increas- Siit)gly good performance in this . market, we exported more to West Germany last year than to any .other country except the U.S., Australia and South Africa. The f report adds:- r \"We have also kept pace with s our competitors more successfully' f than in some other markets, our I share of total West German imports remaining fairly steady it r from 44 to 5 per cent. for some ) years.

Great Britain is not in such dire straits as Is often repre- sented in Europe, said Sir Roderick Barclay, Brditi Ambassador in Belgium, speaking at the Ghent Ine- national Fair to*day.

The 21 per cent. rise in retail prices since 1958 was less than in Italy, Holland or Sweden and only marginally more than in Germany and Belgium. Though agriculture is a problem for Great Britain in joining the Common Market this is not be- cause her farms are inefficient. Their output Is five times that of Belgian farms though the man- power is only four times as great, In France 19 per cent. of the national labour force is engaged in agriculture producing only 6 per cent. of the gross domestic product. In Great Britain the correspondina figures are 4 per cent. and 4 per cent., in Germany 11 per cent. and 6 per cent, 6 What really matters now,\" said Sir Roderick, ' is the determination of the British Government to Im- plement measures, however un- gopular, which will have positive ensefcial effects on the longer term, If you invite me here again next year, I believe I shall be able to point out that this has been successfully achieved.\" British Day was held at the Ghent Pair as usual this year despite the fact that there Is not a single British exhibitor.

There is little doubt that the index has been distorted on this occasion by the seamen's strike. Engineering Rise It is known that the figures on which the Government statisticians base the index do not always relate to actual output from production lines. Sometimes they are gleaned from statistics relating to deliveries. This is particularly true of some light engineering goods--and signi- ficantly, it is the engineering and allied industries which are said to have made the most progress in July. That section of the index dealing with their performance shows a rise, after seasonal adjustment, ol no less than six points. This is the biggest improvement in well over a year, and almost certainly reflects the release of goods at the end of the seamen's strike. Because engineering accounts for nearly one-third of the total weight- ing given to the all-industries index, any marked change here has a dramatic effect on the overall figures.

This is two lure for June, and only one,below SDespite the jump which is said to have occurred in July, the Central Statistical Office pointed out that in the three months ended July production appears to have been 0.6 per cent. lower than in the preceding quarter. Quarterly Fall The index which covers only manufacturing industries-it ex- cludes mining, construction, gas, electricity and water-is estimated to have jumped three points in the month. But over the quarter, a decrease of 1 per cent. is estimated, compared with the February-April period. The quarterly decreases sui- gested by the Government's figure, are not in line with reports made by businessmen to the Confedera- tion of British Industry. On the other hand, CBI mem- bers' predictions of a continuing rise in output during the July- October period are not likely to be realised, since they were made before the Prime Maister an- nounced his economic measures in July. *The latter were designed to curb spending at home \" shake out\" surplus skilled workers from some industries into others where their services were urgently needed, and ultimately to boost export iroduc- tion. The Government believes that its all these things happen the produc- tion index should for some months remain fairly stable at its present high level, and then show a steady rise. However, with the car and tractor Industries largely resorting to short-time working rather than to wholesale \"shake outs,\" a re- newed fall in the index seems more likely.",

These fgiures, issued yesterday in a report by the Department of Economic Affairs, show that expenditure by British visitors in overseas countries has been rising by Â£20m. to Â£30m. annually *nnI 1Q r . since 1962. The result has been an increas- ing travel\" deficit - it reached Â£97m. last yeat when Â£290m. left Britain in this way against Â£193m. earned from foreign visitors. Over Sm. British people now go abroad each year on holiday or business, with about three-quarters of the total expenditure devoted to holidays, and the rest for busi- ness purposes or other travel. Spending Limit On the need for imposing a Â£50 basic limit on foreign holiday spending since the average spent is less than that, the report shows that many spend a great deal more.' On the evidence of previous years, over a third of all holiday visits overseas not only cost more than Â£50 but were responsible for nearly two- thirds of the total spending. Nearly half of total spending was by people taking over Â£75 abroad. And over a tenth was by people taking more than Â£150, although they formed only a small proportion of the total number of travellers. Stressing that the Â£50 limit is a short-term measure and that foreign travel is not in itself a bad thing, the report suggests that: \"As pros- perity here increases, and as travel to the continent gets easier, with modern car ferries, quick air trips and, probably, the building of the Channel tunnel, more and more British people are likely to go abroad. and our spending to increase.\" Commenting on the changing pattern of British holiday travel, the report says that the number of people taking a second holiday away from home rose from 1.5m. In 1951 to over Sm. last year.",

It is available commercially in developmental quantities. The trade-name is Torvex. The materials used are either pure alumina or a combination of alumina, silica and mullite. The former can be used at 1500'C and the .lattet at 1350*C. It has a high surface area per unit- volume-384 square feet per cubic foot of material for the cell ize of Y inch. It is highly refractory and stable, chemically inert and has black-body radiation char- actetistics. The material offers uniform support for precious-metal catalytic gauzes. It is being used in nitrogen oxide fume abaters. for the abatement of hydro- carbon solvent fumes and heat transfer in combustion systems. .Metal-Diamond Abrasive A new abrasive was described to the International Industrial Diamond Conference at Oxford by Mr. E. G. Lundblad, general manager of ASEA. Roberts- fors, Sweden. It is Nicodur R. The essential point about this abrasive is that the individual diamond crystals are coated with a reactive metal of high tensile strength. When diamonds are embedded in resin to make the abrasive for a cutting or grinding tool, the particles are not chemically bonded to the resin. So they can be pulled out of the base material. In addition the temperature reached can ex- ceed that at which the resin is stable. Again there is loss of diamond particles. With Nicodur R the metallic coatings cause better heat dis- sipation and the bonding of the By Our Scientlic Editor it- metal with the resin causes im, n .proved adhesion under stress. do The metal used so far in the ,ra ASEA abrasive is nickel, 8, deposited by electroplating. e, This use of metal 61adding is lIe claimed as revolutionary in the al industrial-diamond industry. De is Beers also has its own RDA-MC. the General Elec- er tric Company (U.S.) its RVO- on W. and Norton Abrasives its e. Armor-Plate. All these also use at nickel as the cladding material. at Utility Repairs Of' Quentsplass, of Thorp Arch of Trading Estate, Boston Spa, ry Yorks has available a stopping- nd and-filling material called I- Quentsyl. Starting as a paste, which is then activated y a rm second chemical, it is said to tat set hard in 10 minutes even at aed low temperatures. s* Quentsyl adheres well to \"' metal, stone and other t materials and is flexible enough s*Â» to be used with thin metal. It is resistant to petrol and most common chemicals and im- permeable to water. It has uses for the repair of vehicles, caravans, glass-fibre products ed and gutters. ial ' Cryogenic Insulation *s* A new type of cryogenic in- sulation has been introduced his by Spembly Technical Pro- al ducts, Sittingbourne, Kent ad Known as Dimplar, it takes the gh form of alternate layers of fiat ids and pre-crinkled polyester 'film. ke This method of assembly is or claimed to provide hight Ire efficient, resilient, yet sell :e supporting-insulation. ult Using Dimplar, the design on engineer has the advantage of x- mathematically predictable is thermal efficiencies for applica- of tions involting vacuum-jacketed transfer lines, Dewar-type lic storage vessels and space is- vehicles. he In transfer lines the insula- tion can be applied directly to the cold pipe. Alternatively the material's rigidity enables it to be supported on insulated spacers between, hot and cold pipes. An example of its use is on a 4-inch diameter tube carrying a 1-inch helium line: 15 layers of Dimplar give a termal loss of 0.08 watts per linear foot. Thermoplastic' Polyester A thermoplastic material is reported from Algemene Kunast. zijde Unic in* Holland (Post Box 60, Arnhem), with the hard properties of a polyester. The company considers its Arnite is the first breakthrough in this field and it.is so hard that it cannot be measured on the Rockwell scale. Arnite can be processed by normal methods and will be on show at the Dutch plastics exhibition. MacroPlastic, in Utrecht in October. Utilisation of Coal The activities of the British Coal Utilisation Research Association remind. us that coal is still one of the leading fuels of the world. The latest number of the Association's Gazette- (price 5s.) published from Randalls Road, Leather- head, Surrey, has several articles concerned with coal uses. One deals with Magneto. hydrodynamic Electric Power Generation, one source of heat being coal combustors. Facts about the plasma heating of coal show that the volatile components can be directly con- verted, to important chemicals. The U.S. office of Coal Re- search has in fact placed a 1.8m. dollar contract for the development of a process for the electric-are treatment of coal.

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORDON TETHER .: .... B1..**\". : y THE ANNUAL meetings of the Fund and the World Bank have almost never turned out to be the c exciting occasions one alight be s led to expect by the orgy of . speculation about their possible consequences that. goes on before- Shand. And if-as we are, being told-the main topic this year is t 'to be laternational liquidity reform, they are likely to prove even more futile than ever. Which suggests that the managements of both institutions would do well to con- sider whether. any useful purpose t is being served by continuing this annual jamboree in its present ' shape and - if not - whether it should either be sctapped al- together or given a much more constructive form. Caused Tensions Ever since the Bretton Woods institutions appeared on the econo- mic map a year or two after the war, the late summer has. been a period wherein the international financial markets were particularly apt to develop worrying tensions. The reason for this is to be found in the widespread assumption that a massive get-together of Finance Ministers and top central bankers arranged for the express purpose of enabling them to exchange views on the maior financial issues of the day was quite likely to throw up important decisions-decisions affecting such vital matters as the relationship between the values of different currencies, the future of the price of gold, the creation of additional international liquidity, and so on. It wouldn't be strictly true to say that no decisions have ever been taken on these occasions. From time to time it has been announced when they ended that the governors of the Fund or the governors of the Bank had reached agreement on a proposal to set a reform in motion or to inaugurate an inquiry into the possibility of doing so. But what the meetings have almost invariably betn doing on these occasions is merely to put the appropriate stamp on con- clusions reached beforehand by the executive directors of the two insti- tutions or in other contacts between the countries mainly con- cerned. It is difficult to point to a single development in the inter- national financial field that can be said to have been sparked off by the work done at the annual meet- ings themselves. It can, of course, be argued that the exchanges of 'views between financial policy-shapers of so many different lands .made possible by these annual meetings must have served some useful purpose. But their-value even in this conniection has been materially reduced during the past few yeast-by two develop- ments which have a most impor- tant bearing on this aspect of the matter. One is the rapid growth in the membership produced by the recruitment of large numbers of newly-independent territories- the total number of countries on the registers of the two institutions Is now in the region of 100, which is very nearly double what it was in the early post-war years. With so many hands to be shaken and so many voices to be heard, the scope for serious discus- sion of the kind that must precede decisions on major international financial issues is becoming more and more limited. At the same time, the emergence of important new international financial col- laboration mechanisms providing facilities for more or less con- tinuous discussion and treatment by the pace-setting countries of the more important financial questions of the day must clearly act as a further discouragement to the use of the annual Fund and Bank meet- ings for this purpose and reduce the need for it. It is true that organisations, like the \" Group of Ten \" and the devel- opment aid wing of the OECD are concerned with big countries rather than small ones, whereas the annual meetings of the. Fund and the Bank provide the small coun. tries with an opportunity to have a say. But it is difficult to believe that they manage to get any mes- sage through the hub-bub of these annual jamborees that they could not put over more effectively in other ways-for example, through their representation on the manage- ment Boards of the Fund and Bank. The plain truth is, in short, that there is less hope nowadays than there ever was of significant pro- gress towards the solution of the world's financial problems being achieved at the annual meetings of the Fund and the Bank-at least as these affairs are at present organised. And, as I said at the start, if the prediction that the main theme this year will be the international liquidity issue is borne out, it promises to be a par- ticularly barren occasion. It is the case, after all, that the countries that have the big say on this matter have been going over it time and again for several years now. ' All the facts and all the attitudes are well-established and well-known. So it is hard to see what purpose can possibly be served by having another major debate on the subject within a few weeks of the * presentation of the conclusions reached by'the \"'Group of Ten \" after its latest exhaustive inquiry. One would have thought that, if this is the best that the annual meetings of the Fund and Bank can do, the sensible thing wopld be to discontinue them in theirvpesent form-after all, if they are to serve no really useful purpose, the world might as well be spared the nuisance they cause by adaing to tensions in the currency inarkets in August and September eachtryear. But if this is considered to involve too much of a break with tradition -and the annual meetinigs of the Fund and Bank have been going on long enough now to have be- come one-an attempt should be made to ensure that the timie and energy the world's financial top management devotes to them brings a more substantial Xeturn. 'Obvious Choice One way in which this might be done is by arranging for each annual nieeting to concentrate on one problem-preferably a prob- lem that is currently demanding special attention but has not been so done to death already that little is going to be achieved by debat- ing it anew. The obvious choice for this year, starting from this standpoint, would be the question of whether advanced cimntries -should not undertake to make the channelling at an agreed minimum proportion of their national pro- duct into assistance to the under. privileged a first charge on their external and internal economic policies. The deficit countries' discovery in recent years that balance of payments considerations make it impossible for them to grant more assistance to others, and the simul- taneous discovery by many of the surplus countries that budgetary considerations prevent their dona- ting more too, is the great bugbear of the day in the development aid field. Countless milliots' could benefit if the matter were given even a quarter of the attention de- voted to the international liquidity issue.",

   "text_content" : "THE ANNOUNCEMENT of c any major shift in economic h policy is .always followed by a / period of waiting. If there is p one lesson which should have si been learned about the economy h by now it is that measures to c stimulate or control demand n work more slowly than almost tl everyone-including the Govern- d ment-expects. Even once the h measures are beginning to make a themselves felt a further period c passes before actual changes P show up in the statistics. Thus s one might say that the latest r figure in the index of industrial c production is in one sense by s now of merely historical interest. 1 a Budget Forestalling r The revised series for this year s shows that output rose to a peak 1 in March, evidently stimulated by Budget forestalling, and then declined rather less precipitately in the second quarter than had originally been thought. The June figure has now been revised t upwards by one point. More surprisingly, July shows a two- I point jump, bringing the index within one point of the March peak. In fact actual output may hardly have changed between the two months. The engineering and allied industries, according to the statistics, increased produc- tion sharply in July. But parti- cularly in the light engineering sector, deliveries are taken as a measure of output. What appears to have happened is that production continued uninter- rupted in June but deliveries were held up by the seamen's strike. As goods started moving freely again after the end of the strike, deliveries shot up. Taking a slightly longer view, the index confirms that the I Government was forced to take 1 the July measures when expan- sion had already come to a halt. In the three months from May to July. industrial production was 0.6 per cent. lower than in the preceding three-monthly period. The fall was most marked in engineering and metal manufactures-the latter classi- fication includes the steel industry-but of all the major branches only the chemical industry was able to produce a statistically . significant, albeit small, rise. Just how the .index will behave from now on is hard to fore- f cast. Because of the changing i holiday pattern,-the figure for a August is in.any case likely to is prove unreliable, And it does e'e seem that industry as a whole 'y has only started to adjust to the o changed economic outlook this d month. In the, last few weeks st the announcements of redun- - dancies and short-time working e have conie thick and, fast. Not - all the responsibility for these I can he attributed to the July s package. Thus it was obvious s some time ago that after a st reasonably good first half year., al car production was bound to ly show * a seasonal drop. . The mt. ovement has. of course been accentuated by gloomier pros- pects for next spring as a result of' the squeeze. Tractors are ir suffering from a world wide drop k in demand. ,d Consumer durables did not n have a good start to the year and ly in the last few weeks have been d hit by destocking as well as by e a further fall in sales. Just how d tough the going for the consumer re industries in general is going to 0' be depends a great deal not only x on the general economic climate in the months to come but also y on the extent to .which people e will reduce or actually draw on ig savings. Whether output as a Ig whole will fall will hinge on what ' happens to investment and - exports. On the former it is not as easy to be optimistic. Industry as is undoubtedly feelipg the pinch at now and the liquidity squeeze is at likely to tighten yet further. r- Investment projects are bound to es be affected. is rig Export Outlook he For exports, the outlook w remains favourable though it he does at this stage look as though ke the expansion of world trade ,n. could slow down next year.

   "text_content" : "THE END of confrontation does not seem to have spelt the end of trouble for the Malay- sian states in North. Borneo. This week in the course of stormy debate in the Malaysian parliament the Deputy Premier, Tun Razak, claimed that the threat of a rising by Communist guerillas in the jungles of Sarawak was growing serious. He also suggested that the polli tical upheavals at present under way In this large but under* populated part of Malaysia could endanger the resÂ§ of the Federation if they were not brought under control. Both re* marks were made in the course of a debate on a constitutlonal Bill (since passed) which will give the central government of Malaysia power to intervene against the present highly con- troversial Chief Minister of Sarawak. They show very clearly that Kuala Lumpur is, to say the loeast of It. nervous about the postvconfrontation situation in Borneo.

Some of the steps taken to deal with this situation have been beyond criticism. It was a sensible step, as well as a welcome gesture that confronta. tion is reilly over, to arrange with the Indonesian Govern. ment for the establishment of joint patrols to police the border between Sarawak and Indo. nesiun Borneo. It Is also a great relief that no one has suggested that the withdrawal of British troops from the area should. be halted.

   "text_content" : "BY SAMUEL' BRITTAN, OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR I r s e a t e e d C C i c T HE RECENT outbreak of redundancies and short-time working has made many people wonder how high unem- ployment is .going to go during the current phase. of economic stop. The September figures due out to-day will show an increase, but not of the sensational sort that some people have been pre- dicting. The S6ptember count - was taken ten days ago, too early to be influenced by the BMC and other similar announcements. The total number unemployed in all categories, before seasonal adjustment, reached 317,000 in August. An increase of about 11.000 can be expected on sea- sonal grounds alone; and the addition of the underlying up- ward trend of recent months is likely to take this month's total to somewhere in the 340,000 mark. This comes to a rate of ui around 1.4 per cent. w How-high is the total likely to si go this winter or the one after? fil History, although far from a se perfect guide, probably 'gives a ol better clue than doubtful arith- re metic about the future. After' cc the Thorneycroft squeeze of September 1957, unemployment reached a peak, not the next winter but the one following, of 620,000 actually out of work. it Again the unemployment peak o after Mr. Selwyn-Lloyd's 1961 tr squeeze.did not come until the tl winter of 1962-63. It is difficult f< to say how high unemployment 1i would have gone without the e: THE LAST Gruatlritlil unusual Arctic weather, but it t would probably have come to a s similar, perhaps slightly higher t figure. On this assumption, the t seasonally adjusted percentage s of those wholly' out of work 1 reached a peak of around 2* per ( cetit. In .both the last two cycles. 9 Labour Force Are there reasons for expect- 1 ing the next recession to work I out differently? The main force t making for greater optimism is i that the labour force, which had ( formerly been growing by around 4 160,000 a year (and grew by an ; exceptionally large amount in I the winter of 1962-63) has now stopped rising almost completely. Another favourable influence is that the prospects for world trade seem better than in 1958 or 1962, although if the U.S. and Germany take violent braking action to halt inflation, the out- look here could change. On the other side, the squeeze itself is perhaps harsher than the Thorneycroft or Lloyd measures. It is not so much that last July's nieasures themselves were so much more severe. but that they came on top of a whole series of earlier deflationary measures - including the notorious and un- predictable SET-which had not yet worked their way through the economy. But the main argument on the side of those who expert the present squeeze to nave a severer effect on employment is the shakeout theory. This asserts that a good deal of labour hoarding has taken place in.the last year or two-partly under the influence of the Government's own propaganda about manpower gaps-and that the shock to expectations will now cause employers to dis- gorge workers. It is certainly true that all the forecasters were greatly surprised when unemployment failed to rise ----------- during the last year or so despite b the slow growth of production. i But whether this puzzling behaviour was due to labour- : hoarding, or simply to the cut v in working. hours or a sluggish c underlying movement of pro- a ductivity, the next few months r will show. The one inescapable conclusion 'is that, the more N slowly productivity rises, the less c unemployment Mr. Wilson's measures are likely to cause. It would be desirable to see this point, which no one has suc- ceeded in refuting, pressed at next week's Productivity Con- ference. Rather than risk being told the old joke about the U.S. President who asked where he could find a \"one-handed\" economist, one might as well give a personal guess about how unemployment will move. This h would be that the unadjusted unemployment total is likely to rise towards the 700,000 mark before it reaches a turning ' point. (Of course, a really Arctic is winter like 1962-3 could make is this estimate seem ludicrously f low, but freak weather is by definition improbable.) Ã½y Peak Period a Judging by previous cycles the t unemployment peak is to be ex- 1I pected not, this winter but in 1967.8. This still seems the most ly probable outcome. But in view rs of the \"shakeout\" factors a \" much greater proportion of the 5 eventual increase may take place earlier than on previous occa- sions; and it would not be sur- prising if unemployment went considerably above 500,000 be- fore next winter is over. Official forecasts are, needless to say, more restrained. Un- r fortunately , it is difficult to r expound the official reasoning a fairly when all the key calcula- e- tions are shrouded under a of needless veil of secrecy. But ly there is reason to suppose that n' Government forecasts show a o- 2 per cent; unemployment rate ay by the end of 1966. and this is sufficiently close to the indepen- dent forecasts of the National Institute's forecast. to use the latter as a guide. be added. This has been done in the third column of the table. The next problem is the num- ber \" temporarily stopped,\" which is excluded from the fore- cast. Generally speaking there is a tendency for the figure of tem- porarily stopped to reach its peak fairly early on and not go very much higher during the course of the recession. Token figures of 50,000 have been in- serted in the table for both this winter and the one after. Thr moral of the table is that even on a fairly orthodox forecasting approach, the actual numbers out of work could go above 600.000, or 2.7 per cent., by the winter after next. Too Optimistic ? There are two main ways ias which such forecasts may under- state the rise in unemployment. First. they may be too optimistic about output. The National Institute, for example, suggests that by. the end of this year the GDP will be at about the same lev6l as at the beginning, and rise by a little more than 1 per cent. in the course of 1967. In the last two cycles the GDP fell by 1-2 per cent. between the pr9c vious peak and the recession .low point. The second possible source of error, already dis- t cussed, is that the standard fore- casts may have underestimated previous labour hoarding and perhaps also the upward move- ment of productivity. It is quite true that forecasts t are meant to give the centre of a range of probability and may thus as easily understate as over- s state the course of unemploy- . ment. But on the other hand, Â· the forecasting process does seem to show a bias towards what might be called \" excessive a moderation,\" underestimating t both booms and recessions. t Although the exact level that a unemployment will reach is very e much a matter of guesswork, s it is likely to remain nearer its i- peak for a longer period than Ij in previohts cycles. It will e resemble in this respect much more the high point of a plateau",

If there is an accident to the companv car on a pleasure trip. then company B tries to pass on half the third-party claim to com- pany A. - If this is accepted by A, the no-claim bonus under A is forfeited-that is, certain insurance companies are receiYviig two pre- miums for the same risk and attempting to cancel the no-claim bonus, or in effect increase the premium if a claim is made. The remedy appears to be to have the, offending clause with. respect to third parties removed from the private car's policy-that is, the indemnity to the Insured while driving other cars. No re- duction in the premium is obtained, though, of course, the insurance company's risk has been consider- ably reduced. A. It FINNIBCOME. \" Tall Tresei\" The Spinney. Wlilltorpe, Neiwark.

Many industrial and commercial companies carry out a staff salary review, based on individual per- formance, towards the end of each year. In the ordinary course of events, staff whose performance during 1966 merits recognition would receive an individually assessed increase from January 1, 1967. Essentially, therefore, this is a. selective salary increase re- lated to personal merit-the anti- thesis of the indiscriminate \" across the board\" increases which the Government is determined to check. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the indications so far are mislead- ing and that the Government, in fixing the criteria for pay increases in 1967, will mali some provision for merit increases. If this is not done, a roar of protest ought to go up from all those concerned with the business of rewarding staff who do a first-class job. For, quite apart from the fact that merit increases are awarded on a selective and controlled basis (which is what the nation's in- torcsts demand), it is entirely inequitable that these should be prohibited while Civil Service, Local Government and other in- cremental scales are allowed to operate. Incidentally, my reference is to incremental scales for service V in a grade; these are quite different from juvenile wage-for-age scales, I which must continue to operate as I a matter of common sense. The White Paper's justification for the payment of fixed salary in croments, In spite of the standstill, is that \"Such arrangements are equivalent to promotion according to . . . experience.\" So on the basis of \"promotion through ex- perience.\" public servants are still s getting their salary increases-and 6 good luck to them. But if logic and equity mean anything, the i same principle must surely be t applied (certainly in the period of o \"severe restraint\") to those whose * salaries go up only if their em- ployers assess their performance I as being worth an Increase. -y It may be argued that, while dis- r- cretionary increases are for- :h bidden, the Civil Service and other As organisations operating incremental ce scales are bound to pay the incre- on ments because they form part of ly a contract. But this is obviously 1, nonsense, in the context of em- is ployers in general being urged e. (indeed required) to break con- ti. tracts which provide for pay ss increases. ic C. T.

Among other things, he said: \" Profit is necessary to keep our stock of assets up to date and to enable them to be modernised and to give a return on savings. Companies must earn a proper return on their capital, and profit is not, and should not be, a dirty word where it is properly earned. This statement, coming from a Socialist Chancellor, should receive the widest publicity so that other Socialist Ministers and Members of Parliament may be deterred from making unjustified attacks against the necessity for profits in trade and industry. For too long has the word \" profit\" been the brick-bat of Socialist politicians, so let us hope that Mr. Callaghan's pronounce- meint really indicates a change of attitude and will enable the pros- perity of trade and industry to be lifted out of the mire of party politics.

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staff The British Motor Corporation has agreed to amend the form of its guaranteed weekly minimum wage for men on short time so that they are eligible for unemployment benefits for the days they are not at work. About 38.600 workers will gain by the change, which was made after consultation with the Ministries of Labour and Social Security. . I Security. Because the normal guarantee ol Â£10 is in weekly form, the men or short time are not technically un employed on the days they do noi work. So BMC has now guaranteed men on a three-day week Â£10 foi those three days. Men on a two. day week have been guaranteed Â£10 for two days. This means they will be able to claim unem- ployment pay for the remaining days. The guarantee is well below normal earnings and so the changes are not expected to make any significant alteration to BMC's wage bill. Workless Total Meanwhile, Ministry of Labour figures for the sensitive car industry centres of Coventry and Birming. ham do not yet reflect more than a general and seasonal trend, reports Our Midlands Corre- spondent. But they were taken before the 38.600 BMC workers were put on short time, so that the Birmingham September count of 1.573 men temporarily stopped (against 76 in August) will rise very sharply. So too will the figure for Coventry, where about 10,000 are currently on short time against the Ministry's earlier figure of 574 (65). These increases are not propor- tionately very much greater than those in areas where the vehicle industry plays only a minor role. In Wolverhampton, for instance, the temporarily stopped rose from four in August to 306 this month. Nor do the unemployment figures yet reveal .more than the general effects of the economic squeeze. Between the August and September counts, the Birmingham percentage rose from 0.7 to I per cent.-still under half the national average and at Coventry it went up from 0.9 to 1.4. In Nottingham and Stoke depending largely on textiles and pottery respectvely. the rate of in- crease was only a little less. The job vacancies position also showed little more than the seasonal swing combined with the still small effects of the squeeze. In Birmingham they dropped by 534 to 4,428, compared with a drop between August and Septem- ber last year of 357. Linwood Redundancies Shop stewards at the Rootes Pressings factory, Linwood, Ren- frewshire, where about 500 men are due to be made redundant, were told by the management yes- terday there could be -no work- sharing on the Hillman Imp car body building lines. A spokesman for the company said this would be uneconomic. However, work-sharing would be introduced in two small depart- ments and among a number of service personnel, involving a total of about 175 men. A mass meet- ing of the 6,000 men at the factory is being held to-day. But five-day working should be maintained at Rootes Group's Coventry factories, Mr. Brian Rootes, managing director, said yesterday. Much depended on what happened in the next six weeks, he added. Reliant Cut-back The Reliant Motor Company also announced short-time working yesterday. Of 700 workers-just under half the total labour force- at the Tamworth, Staffs, plant, 400 would go on a four-day week and 300 on a three-day week next week. No redundancy was contemplated at this stage, but the position was under constant review. It was also announced yesterday that 300 of the workers already on short-time at BMC's factory in Bathgate. Scotland. are being cut back to a two-day week. Lucas Warns A spokesman for Joseph Lucas organisation said an announcement on short-time working was ex- pected soon-possibly before the week-end.

   "text_content" : "By Our Midlands Correspondent Suvur Mita lani MR. FRANK COUSINS, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, is ex. pected to define in detail to-day his union's attitude to the credit squeeze, especially as it affects the vehicle industry. While the union has so far been playing down the possibility of strikes to reinforce demands for work-sharing as an alternative to redundancy, it is believed it will be prepared to sanction industrial action in certain circumstances. Among the most important re- ports reaching the executive of the union yesterday, during its quarterly meeting at Coventry. was that from the Midlands. The regional car advisory comn mittce of the union, representing 100,000 car and component workers, held a three-hour meeting in Birmingham to consider the general situation in the industry. While Mr. Harry Urwin, regional secretary, refused to make any statement after the meeting, It is understood that the commitee viewed the future from three aspects - the credit squeeze, seasonal influences, and competi. tion. The first two, it seems, were deemed short-torn, and would be followed by an upswing in the industry, If only these two factors are involved, then the union is likely to resist sackings to the ex. tent of calling strikes at key plants. If. on the other hand-and the committee feels to an extent that BMC is in this category-produc- tion cutbacks are due to competi- tion from other models. it would not oppose redundancy. though needing to be convinced of its necessity. There is no doubt that the unions in general, not just the TGWU. are using the situation to make clear to BMC management that they expclt full-time officials to be brought right to the contre of con- sultative machinery. More Talks The exefutive committee of the Coventry district of the Confedera. tion of Shipbuilding and Engineer. ing Unions. representing about 40,000 vehicle and component workers (among others), which also met yesterday, condemned BMC for the manner of its redundancies announcement and lack of consul. tatlon with full-time officials. The committee instructed shop stowards not to hold further meet. ings with the management until full-time officials had been given an opportunity of entering into full discussions,. t decided that redun. dancy was not acceptable to the unions If Its purpose was to provide full-time working for the re- mainder, low Much Higher Will Uemployment Go 7 Page 12",

   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspondent Mr. Heath, Leader of the Opposition, yesterday accused the Government of \" double-talk \" about its intentions on the wages front once the period of standstill and severe restraint ends next July. He challenged Mr. Wilson to clear up the \" confusion \" which, She said, was undermining business confidence and preventing industry from forward planning. Mr. Heath, who was speaking at y Milngavie, in Scotland, said that n at the TUC Conference the Prime n Minister had hinted that when the t period of severe wage restraint was over, unions and employers should not expect simply to return to normal. S He added: \"When the con. ference was over, the word was discreetly spread among journalists that this was the key part of Mr. Wilson's address.\" \" Veiled Threat\" Mr. Heath said the second phase ,of the operation was for other Cabinet Ministers to enlarge on this \" veiled threat\" with even more ominous noises. Mr. Cross. man had said that there could be no return to normal bargaining. and at the same time the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said the reverse-that it would be his wish to end Government inter- vention in wage negotiation as soon as possible. \"Soon afterwards, four or five other Cabinet Ministers followed the Crossman line. Some wrapped it up more than others, but the message was plain-the Govern- ment intended to have a say in collective bargaining long after the wage freeze has melted.' Mr. Heath said that as \"alarm began to bounce in industry and in the unions about the meaning of this.\" a totally different view was apparently put by the Minister for Economic Affairs. In talks with the TUC and .with the em- ployers' Confederation, Mr. Stewart seemed to deny'the Cross- man line completely. Both delegations. said Mr. Heath, came away apparently having been assured that the Government had no intention of abandoning its reliance on voluntary .collective bargaining- providing it is responsibly \" con- ducted, whatever that may mean. Mr. Heath asked who was expressing the Government's real intentions-Mr. Stewart and Mr. Callaghan, or the Crossmanites?

   "text_content" : "By GEORGE CYRIAX One of the Government'! more popular recipes for im proving the U.K.'s economic performance. due to be aired al the coming Productivity Confer ence, is that British industry should be more ready to invest in new ideas. The U.K.. so the argument runs. has originatec many of the finest now product! in this century, from Perkin't discovery of. artificial dyestuffi to Dr. Barnes Wallace's work on swingowing aircrft but on very occasionally-as witt - Calico Printe and .C.'si wor on Terylene--have British domn panies invested enough to take new ideas'thro' h to their mn*.r ketable and rfit-makin form, The feaeing hat the U.K. is missing the technological plums has not only influenced the Gov- ernment 'into sponsoring wide ranging programmes of techno- logical research, but.is also lead- ing many boardrooms, normally conservative in their approach. to put substantial sums of money behind new and capital- hungry products' such as micro- circuits, container ships, indis- trialised building systems or fully automatic machine tools. Occasionally such spending turns up a winner, so carrying an aura naf cxcitnmnt to aeal to the businessman's 'gambling instinct. But my experience is that new technologies seldom produce the profitability ex- pected and, particularly in the light of the profit squeeze, that the whole approach to backing new products or production methods in industry needs to be carefully reviewed. It Rarely Pays, A moment's 'consideration is all that is needed to show how rarely it pays in the U.K. to make products which are far in the technological lead. A sample of projects in this cate- gory might include the Con- cord, the Hovercraft, atomic power construction or com- puters; in each.case British com- panies. in conjunction with the U.K. Government. can be said to have risked large sums in a new technology before anyone else in the world. Yet in each of these fields it is the costs rather than the likely benefits which are the most striking sea- ture of the project. Concord, whose development costs alone have now soared above Â£500m., has less potential for a proper return on capital invested than most projects in the world aircraft industry: in a way that is not unusual, profit- ability in the. aircraft industry seems to increase steadily as the futuristic quality of the product declines. Thus Boeing has made handsome profits from its stan- dardised jets carefully tailored to the commercial market: the engine-makers. like Rolls Royce. have made profits from being able to fit the same engines to a wide range of-new and recon- ditioned- frames; while smaller 's companies, including now y. Handley Page, have begun to ic tap the huge world potential foi it reliable aircraft at a modest r- price. At the bottom end there y is probably no activity in the it industry so generally profitablk le as the intelligently conducted d supply of spares. 5s Computers are another area 8 where the cost of technological * leadership looks to exceed any k likely benefit. The prucial fact y here, which must lie behind the \" calculations of every company k considering the economics of ' launching the next generation e of machines, is that Inter- r- national Business Machines has * 'spent no less than SS,000m. in s the development of its new s System/360 range; this system, which is based on microcircuitry and complete compatabilitv of the units, can hardly do other than represent the order of Y -stakes needed to survive in the I. mainstream of the data-proces- f sing business over the next I twenty years. r Smaller Machines 1.

I hoven for one has decided to I opt out of the main computer market and. to concentrate on much smaller machines and components. In the U.K. too, it t is in the less spectacular fields Sos process control. instrumenta- tion and parts that the profits in automation have been made. These two examples, as well as those of the Hovercraft and atomic power, show the main reasons why out-and-out techno- logical leadership is no longer a logical long-term objective for U.K. companies, although such leadership may still come as the result of a lucky break. For con- sistent technological leadership requires above all money- money to spend on research. money to develop a product from laboratory to commercial production, and above all money to market the product on a world-wide scale. All these are areas where 'ssts escalate on a notorious scale. No board has yet, to my knowledge, found any way of making research outlays more than a speculation with the possible spin-off, as at Rolls- Royce, of creating in the labora- tories a possible breeding- ground for future executive talent. Nor have most com- panies got further than the Government in answering the basic conundrum presented by development-when costs start to escalate, as with the Concord and the TSR2, how to stop plunging wildly forward merely to avoid scrapping all the expenditures that have already been made. Whatever may have been true in the past, the com- parative advantage when it comes to putting large sums of w to ir st re y r t is I in 'y ,f ,r ,f ie s- it Y t- It r J t s i 1 i t r i s ) i i Ss r! I e c ( c ie Sir Denning Pearson SVery much more frequent, Showever, is the situation in - which new processes-a con- > tainer ship. an industrialised - building system. nuclear power -create economies in running costs at the expense of far heavier interest charges and depreciation, since existing plant is standing in the books at little or nothing. The question then becomes not (as the Board often considers it) whether a major, company can afford to have the second- best techniques (it alwiys can so long as the consumer is satisfied with the final product); rather it is to decide under exactly what circumstances the efficiency of new plant justifies (or can be made to justify) its extra capital costs and, equally important, under what circum- stances it will not. Unfortunately, new tech- niques tend to bring out the all- or-nothing instinct both in the Boardroom and the Govern- ment, with the result that the economy suffers. not so much from a general lack of innova- tion as from far too much in- vestment in some areas and.far too little in others,. The areas w hponey at considerable risk lies to with ththe U.S. )r Much the same' considera- st lions, though in modified form, re apply to a second arca of inno- We vation widely urged. on U.K. Ie companies-to install the moso id modern and labour-savin. pro. duction methods. Occasionally. ta as with.the replacement.of coal 11 feedstock by oil in the gas ly industry, or high pressure by Et low pressure manufacture ol ie polyethylene, the total costs of y the new process (including )f interest and depreciation) are a below the .running costs of the r. old; complete replcement .and a capital write-off of old plant is an then the only possibility. r s Y i I e e j s a of over-experiment are invari) ably those which are interesting and to which prestige attaches. Thus Csrussion on whether or not to purchase a computer, in stead of being conducted in ; i terms of, the savings generated and whether there are cheaper Sways of achieving them, usually I boils down to a vote on the pro. gressiveness of Board members; because there can only be one answer to that-there are a great number of computers g doing very little in large U.K. e corporations. 0 The Government, in support* d ing Concord and nuclear power. equally backed innovation in the form of a prestige show. piece and not the product which, on a realistic evaluation, gave at the time the best value for the job to be done. It is not unusual in fact for some of the least progressive organisa- tions,. which need prestige most, to launch themselves most wildly into the future. with the result on profits that such lurches usually have. New Techniques By, contrast, the sort of in- novation of which British industry needs far more is usually miich less spectacular in nature. If it is an innovation in techniques, the management should start from the assump- tion that. if it can' secure no improvement in machine man- ning practices, no increase in shiftwork and' no success by the company (through its pricing and marketing policy) in creating demand for longer runs, it is unlikely that many new processes requiring much capital will be worth installing; when the average printing machine starts running for over four hours a day. when a bargain is reached on the size of dockers' gangs, and when standard lines become more common in the engineering industry, will be the moment at which new produc- tion techniques-which need not be very expensive and are al- ready available in plenty-will become worthwhile. When it comes to product in- novation, the risks are much greater, and a company's only reasonable approach is to mini- mise these wherever it can; a case in point is the formidably successful Spey engine which is now the leading product in the Rolls-Royce range. Under Sir Denning Pearson. the company broadened the market possibili- ties for the engine by extensive international agreements built on existing goodwill; it kept development costs as low as pos- sible by using, wherever possible. ideas and skills already available on the shelf. If the clinching factor was a lucky break in Government ordering, it was a just reward for not losing sight of the business truism that novelty is never an excuse for lack of profit on the deal.",

Apart from the logical advantages from verti- cally integrating a retail and manu- facturing clothing business, it looks as though P.L.'s profits are taking off at just the right time. For the year ended June, 1966, Sidroy cum only six months of P.L.-but worth Â£103,000 compared with Â£166,000 for the whole of the previous 12 months-has managed, with only a small increase on its part, to lift pre-tax profits effectively 14 per cent. to Â£294,000. leaving earnings covering the maintained 15 per cent. dividend more than twice. But with the best part of P.L.'s year.to come the Sidroy group as a whole could have an immediate potential of at least Â£400,000 an- nually' before tax and loan interest, leaving the impression that the pur- chase of P.L. for an effective addi- tion of one-third to the equity, but possibly 70 per cent. to pre-tax profits net of financing charges is a very fair bargain indeed. Thus, at 7s Sidroy could be selling at only 4.8 times earnings and yielding 8.8 per cent.,, which looks more than interesting, particularly as factories are still full of work.

Overall toffee sales did better throughout the year, the boiled sweets subsidiary cut its loss-encouraging since the trend in recent years has seen a steady fall in boiled sweet sales- while the wholesaling activities also did better.

Many seaside municipalities are experiencing growing difficulties with sewage disposal problems and it is anticipated that this method, known as electrolytic sewage treatment, will have wide applications in seaside towns. The system uses electrolysed seawater, a powerful sterilant, to purify sewage. EST has been developed by Constructors John Brown with the co-operation of the Electricity Council. The first commer cial Installation has recently been commissioned in Guernsey. An important factor is that these plants can be accommodated in a compact area.",

   "text_content" : "It seemi intriguing that Viyella International has approached the fixed interest market at much the same time asICL. The latter owns 20 per cent. of Viyella's equity and has advanced to it Â£10m. on unsecured loan. But in fact the timing is merely a coincidence; Viyella's intention is to become an international group within the next five years and its rapid expansion policy involves large sums. Identical Terms In common with ICI's loan, the Â£5m. Debenture 1989-94 from Viyella has an 8 per cent. coupon priced at Â£98. On this basis flat and nal yields to redemption are Â£8 3s 3d and Â£8 3s 6d per cent. respectively. Interest dates are end- June and December with a first payment of Â£4 13s 2d per cent. due next June. Final redemption is on December 31, 1994 at par, but Abridged di a sinking fund of Â£70,000 per annum will come into operation in 1975 to redeem stock, also at par. Covers are more than ad6quate for a group ot this stature; the figure for principal is over 3.5 times while that for interest is more than 7.6 times overall, based on the past three years' profit average, and is still above 6 times for the charging group alone. The issue will raise approximately Â£4.85m. which will be used to reduce bank borrowings -unsecured overdrafts totalled Â£7.96m. on September 1-and for general group purposes. The market readily took up its first entitlement and the prevailing strength of the fixed interest sector suggests that the second call will be equally well received. Dealings in the Â£25 paid form are due to begin on Monday and a premium of between IYe and 2 points is thought likely. N. M. Rothschild & Sons and I Kleinwort Benson arranged the placing with brokers Joseph Sebag & Co. and J. & A. Scrimgour. etails Page 20",

   "text_content" : "The issue last March of $15m. 1 20-Year Bonds for the Govern- ment of New Zealand is now fol- lowed by an offer of SlOm. 10-Year Bonds. But, as may be expected in the light of hardening inter- national interest rates, the current offering is at 7 per cent. compared with 6% per cent, previously while the issue price is 2 points higher at 98 per cent. U.K. Interest It is understood that the issue has been fully subscribed, but whether much activity will be seen when dealings begin to-day remains to be seen. However, it seems likely that U.K. participation will not be very strong since Eurodollar offer- ings come up against the dollar premium and the tax on investment dollar switching. Even so, yield is 7.14 per cent, at the issue price and there is a return of 7.28 per cent. to maturity compared with 6.77 and 6.88 per cent. respectively cur- rently available from the last issue. The bonds, of U.S. $1,000, will be in Bearer form and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges. Principal and interest will be payable in London, New York and certain other European cities. Presumably reflecting the comparatively short life of the bonds, there are no option calls during the period. But an annual sinking fund sufficient to redeem Sim. of stock at par on each Sep- tember 15 starts from 1967; final redemption is at par on Septem- ber 15, 1976. Interest will be paid half-yearly with the first payment due March 15 next. Net proceeds will be included in the New Zealand Government's receipts relating to the public account for the year to end-March 1967. At present the intention is that proceeds will ultimately be used for the programme of capital works and expenditures. Kidder Peabody and Co., of New York and Baring Brothers and Co., London, headed the con- sortium of international under- writers. London brokers are J. and A. Scrimgeour. Particulars Page 16",

Clark, chairman of wine and spirit shippers and merchants, Matthew Clark and Sons (Holdings), does not view immediate prospects very briuhtlv. Immrnediate prospects very bright] Sales in the current year show a 20 per cent. improvement over the exceptionally poor period last year, but It is difficult to forecast how the Christmas trade will turn out. \"We consider spirits in particular have been very harshly treated by the 0overnment and our profits from spirits form a large part of the total for the group. Nevertheless, we know from experience of the extra. ordinary resilience of our trade and I therefore believe that any temporary recession will be overcome.\" says the chairman. Meanwhile, the directors will increase their efforts to improve profitability by greater efficiency and the further development of the group's imported and British wine interests. Duty Increases Mr. Clark points out that in the April 1965 Budget the cost of a bottle of Martell went up by 3s ad, and hbiness entertaining was no longar llowed for income tax. This resulted Sa \" serious ' effect on trade in hotels and restaurants, particularly in London's West End. All spirit agencies which the aomr pany handles were similarly affected, and to t lesser degree so were its wine Interests. Stones' Ginger Wine has beet slightly affected by the duty increases but \"more than holds its own\" compared to other similar wines. Martell was increased hv n liurther 3% 2d per bottle in the Jusly Budget. S and the company has been told hy ilr G Government not to rais the price hy more than the Increase In duly. Yet, says the chairman, the company has to finance duty payments upon which no credit s given by the Customs, while havlng to asccp a soevere strlo. ton or seasonal creditl falllies from the bankers. a ---------- it As reported on September 16, group r, profit before tax for the year ended w April 30. 1966. was Â£452,647 It.

It Is an American machine capable of handling various size cas and packing them Into cardboard cases. It is said to have resulted In lower labour costs. Mr. Macdonald said at last Tuesday's meeting to approve the proposals that he regaided them as \"ill-timed.\" He maintained that the purpose of the scheme-\" although fully lawful and financially admirable \"-was to avoid the incidence of corporation tax and by so'doing make further sums available to the company fn rl;,-lrk llr;,. for distribution. That, he thought, was not in line with the Government's present policy of restraint on wages and incomes. Pointing out that he had written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prices and Incomes Board criticising the arrangement, he added: \" If shareholders do not volun- tarily exercise the restraint other sections of the community are asked to. this may bring nearer some measure of compulsory restraint.\" Lord Cole, in reply, pointed out that the details of the scheme had been announced a fortnight before the Prime Minister's call for a stand- I still. The shares had been dealt with i on the. assumption that, as the an- nouncement stated, the scheme might i he expected to become effective in ] December. Unless it was compelled to do so Unilever did not intend to break faith i with the people who had acted on the strength of that announcement. In the guidance that the Govern- ' ment had given on how people were i expected to act during the standstill I it had nowhere said that tinder no I circumstances should anybody's investment income increase during that period. Lord Cole argued. There was no standstill on take overs. mergers or reconstructions. There was no standstill on interest rates, and indeed the Bank Rate had been, increased from 6 to 7 per cent. the week after Unilever's own announcement. Nothing had been said by the Government to suggest that indi viduals must refrain rom seeking to increase their income by changing their investments from a less profit. able to a more profitable one. Lord Cole emphasised that the Unilever Board in a decision of this kind would always give full weight to the national interest, but the over. riding duty of directors was to obey the law as it stood and the law was plain that it was the duty of directors to conduct the affairs of the company in what they believed to be the best interests' of the shareholders as a whole. The Board was satisfied that it would have been failing in that duty if it had not come forward with a scheme of this kind at the first possible moment.

(same) has already been paid. Net profit came out at Â£33,182 (Â£4.888) after tax of Â£3.620 (Â£15). Dividends absorb Â£18.917 (same). less tax retained Â£6,677 (Â£7.735). Bluebird home sales showed an in- crease over the two previous years and the Parkes tmss was substantially reduced, while the Stobbs companies achieved record sales and increased earnings. However. the rise in exports in each of the prior eight years was not mantained because of price competi. tion in most markets and a fall in sales in the Far East due to confront. ation between Malaysia and Indo- nesia. Overseas licensing arrange- ments are at present being negotiated. The Board is confident, however. that in view of steps taken improved results will emerge. SENA SUGAR OUTPUT DOWN The crushing of Sena Sugar Estates' 1966 crop for the period ended September 17. 1966. has resulted in an output of 74.122 tons of sugar, against 81.427 tons for the corres- ponding period of 1965. Reports indicate that both the quantity of cane available and quality are proving \"disappointing.\" As a result. the total amount of sugar produced from the present crop' is unlikely to be more, than the 113.868 tons for 1965.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1966_0922_0016_002",
   "text_content" : "and NATO defeated From Our Political Reporter BRIGHTON, Sept. 21. Liberal policy on Europe and the Atlantic Alliance was thrown into total confusion on the first day of the Liberal Assembly here when an executive resolution was referred back for reconsideration. AUX KWWUDIIUWERmUIIU The reference back, by a majority of 374 to 314, was a victory for the. militant-and largely Left wing-Young Liberals, who led the assault on executive policy. I With the refusal of the assembly to support the executive resolution, the Liberals have lost a main plank of their policy-support for con- tinued U.K. membership of NATO and a declaration of intent to enter the EEC at the earliest opportunity. Muddled Debate The result of a debate which was muddled even by Liberal standards is that the Liberals now apparently have no policy towards Europe. About the only point on which they could agree was to delete a highly critical reference to President de Gaulle from the resolution, which was perhaps just as well, as this is French Week in Brighton. The Young Liberals, by their aggressive attempts to swing the party violently to the Left, have now thrown the Liberal hierarchy into confusion. The next confronta- tion will come to-morrow when Young Liberals will attempt to force the assembly to adopt a policy of worker control in indus- try. Objective Helped To-day's successful assault on official policy was based on the argument that the resolution, by supporting NATO, would solidify the present divisions within Europe. Instead, the executive's opponents argued, what was needed needed was a much more flexible approach with a recon- struction of NATO and an approach to the Warsaw Pact Mr. Richard Moore, candi- date for Antrim at the last Election, who moved the Atlantic Alliance motion for the execntive. countries designed to achieve disengagement in Central Europe. Their objective was perhaps helped by the way is' which Mr. Richard Moore moved the resolu- tion on behalf of the executive. He badly misinterpreted the attitude of his opponents and provocatively trumpeted his faith in NATO, his hatred of Communism, and his dis- like of the resurgence of national- ism in France and Germany. He admitted the Atlantic Alliance had its embarrassments. \" The presence of the Portuguese dictator- ship in it is a blot and a weakness. But it is only one, and one of the least of its members, which is a dictatorship, whereas aU the Com- munist States, without exception deny their peoples all the fundamental liberties which Liberals champion.\" he declared. It was a combination of reluctance to admit the unpleasant facts of life behind the Iron Curtain, and a sincere but misguided belief that NATO hardened the division of Europe, that lay at the root of the opposition to the resolution. Brought Stability He argued that the recent relaxation in the cold war had taken place because the West, led by the U.S. had brought stability to Europe and this had only been possible because of NATO. If Britain decided to withdraw from NATO under nationalist-neutralist pressure, the consequences for peace would be very dangerous. More countries would seek their own nuclear armouries, and German faith in political partnership with the Western democracies would evaporate. Finally, after spasmodic heckling, he concluded plaintively: \" Liberals are the pioneers of internationalism. That is why we have a duty to give a lead in this debate on the future of the Atlantic Alliance.\" Mr. J. T. Eccles (Farnham) argued that there was a disturbing lack of awareness that Europe was in a remarkably fluid state, whereas the maintenance of the present defence divisions would only ossify the past situation. \"A Wider Vision\" Speaking for the youth movement of the party, Mr. Phllp Kelly, of the Union of Liberal Students. criticised I ---",

Plans for a giant road network that would eventually link Glasgow with Singapore and North Wales with Athens were disclosed in London yesterday to delegates to the fifth world meeting of the I Â» - - *. . n - - -; ,. . -* ! - I -. --- . International Road Federation. It is known as the E-road net- work-the linking of the main international traffic arteries in Europe-and details of it were given by Mr. F. D. Mason, direc- tor of the transport division of .the UN Economic Commission for Europe. rwenty-one European countries t- are parties to the agreement to con- struct these arteries. n They will stretch from Scotland to in the Turkish-Iranian frontier, and will re eventually connect with the Asian highway system. From the North of ' Finland the network reaches the of southernmost tip of Spain: from .n Sicily to Norway: and from Portugal to the Polish-Russian frontier. Mr. Masson said the oroportion. lea in length, of E-roads in the network varied considerably from one country to another. \"To think of the network as an uninterrupted succession of motor- ways would be to dream of a situation unlikely to be realised for several years to come,\" he said \" since there are long stretches of E-roads where the average daily traffic is well below 600 vehicles.\" Development Hopes Too hasty development might be economically unsound, but in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the most spectacular changes would probably take place. Those countries, where numbers of vehicles in relation to population were small, had thrown open their fron- tiers to tourists from Western Europe. many of whom would travel there in buses and private cars, necessitating road improvement. There was also room for improve- ment in the situation of E-roads in Western and Northern Europe, said Mr. Masson. The 21 parties to the agreement, from which notable excep. tions were Switzerland, Czechoslo. vakia and the U.S.S.R.. had not com- mitted themselves to building a net. work of new roads superimposed on those already existing, but have merely given an undertaking to ensure that the roads listed should be progres. lively given some agreed charac teristics adapted to the needs of traffic.

Georges GullHen, president of the French Road Federation, ug-- ested to the meeting that there should be \" enormous efforts\" to interest private investors in European road building Orogrammes. pointina out that \"the rallways In most Western countris were built with private He tlhought that private and Gov- ernment capital could help to Improve the European road system, citing the Mont Blanc tunnel as an example of such joint enterprise, Profesor J.

   "text_content" : "INTERIM STATEMENTS CAMMELL LAIRD AND COMPANY LIMITED iE#d 1.im statement P. B. HUNTER, T.D. CHAIRMAN As was the case last year, long term contracts undertaken b our shipbuilding subsidiary played such a large part in the activities of the group that interim figures would not be a sound indication of the year's trading results and the board has again decided not to issue them. We are encouraged by the activities of our shipbuilding and shiprepairing companies at Birkenhead and present indications are that when the year's results are known, it will be seen that the losses incurred by both these companies last year have been substantially eliminated. Results from Patent Shaft are also encouraging and it appears that the year's figures will be at least as good as last year. The figures from Scottish Aviation so far give good cause for hoping that the results from that company for the eight months which will come into group accounts this year will be well up to the forecast made by my predecessor when this company joined the group. Allowing for the possibility that the political and economic difficulties which at present beset commerce and industry may result in a reduction in our investment income for the year I lool forward with confidence to a trading profit before tax which will be substantially greater than last year. Unfortunately, the taxation recoveries which helped us last year will not arise this year and the provision for taxation on the results of the year will be substantially greater than last year. Dividends being payable gross this year will also cost much more than they did last year. Although, in spite of the antlelpated improvement in trading results, the indications are that a distribution of a total of 12% (the same as last year) may not he fully covered by earnings after taxation, the hoard has confidence that the improvement seen so far will be maintained and Increased in future years and, therefore, it intends, in the absence of unforeseen developments between the present date and the end of the year, to maintain the distributllon at last year's rate, At today's meting. It was decided to declare an Interim dividend of 4% less income tax, for the year ending 31st December 1966, to such shareholders as are registered at the close of business on the 23rd September 1966. Dividend payable 31st October 1966. Transfer books will he closed 24th September 1966 to 7th October 1966, both dates inclusive,. WATFORD ELECTRIC & MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED CHAIRMAN'S INTERIM STATEMENT Profits for the first six months are running at approximately the same level as last year, The Order Book is quite good but is a little smaller than at this time last year, accountes for n part by the Increase In production achieved last year and a further Increase achieved io far this ye r. It is hoped to maintain the improved rate of production for the remainder of the year. Costs have continued to rise but on the foregoin| bails it is antleipated that trading results will be silml r to thoes aeslived last year.

A spokesman for Westland Air- craft denied any knowledge of the 100 per cent. expansion of the Hovercraft production run.

Sir Giles and All Fouind- meeting in the two mile Gordon Carter Handicap (3.20). They are handicapped at pre- cisely the same terms as in the frst leg of the Autumn Double, and, since no penalty will be incurred by the winner, there is every in- centive to pick up this useful prize en route to Newmarket. Sayfar, a grey half-brother, by Sayajlrao, to Roan Rocket, is a pretty good colt, who finished second in this race last year before running Mintinaster and Asureate to a neck and a short head in the Cesarewitch. And this season he has run well in both the Chester Cup and the Ebor Handicap. Sir Giles has not been seen in public since winning the Rusebery Memorial Handicap at the Epsom Derby meeting and in consequence may be in need of a race. Todd, a past-master In the art of training stayers, could win the Klnnaird Stakes (2.0) with Medaea. nuU5gn I dillm uuuunui aa &W J- ability to beat Bribe, an Aureole colt whom L. Piggott rides for V. O'Brien's stable. There are two races for two- year-olds on to-day's Ascot card, either or both of which could throw light on next year's classics. The first of these, the Chertsey Stakes (2.40), will probably be won by Royal Saint, a filly by Saint Crespin III. out of a Crepello mare, who won her only previous lace, at Brighton, last month, though the superbly-bred Sun Palace might constitute a danger. Murless's Rougeway, who showed immense promise on his only previous appearance, at the York Ebor meeting, is likely to be too good for Reform at a difference of 9 lbs in the Clarence House Stakes (3.50). Bearly Legal, on the 8 st 3 lbs mark, is my idea of the probable winner of the Lichfield Nursery Handicap (4.20). At Pontefract. Flora Leihl is unlikely to be beaten in the Goole Plate (2.30). and I doubt the ability of Robinson CrNsoe to concede 11 lbs successfully to Preclusion in the Borough Handicap (3.30).",

   "text_content" : "By Our Motoring Correspondent Associated Engineering is introducing a system of electronai cally-controlled fuel injection which is designed to replace the carbaretter on engines of volume-produced cars. It is now being tested by British car manufacturers who are stated to have reported favourably on it, although so far none has had sufficient time to conclude its trials. & *iguUICUL UIIJC LU GUIRIUUC It: The cost depends on the quantities to be made, and no specific figure can therefore be given at present. It is certain to be more expensive than a carburetter, but, it is claimed, would compensate for this by allowing a saving of 10 per cent. or more in fuel consumption. This is due to the accuracy with which it has to meter exactly the correct amount of fuel going into the engine. Other gains will be in power-probably around an 8 per cent. increase-also a reduc- tion in the amount of toxic and smog-forming gases in the exhaust, better cold starting and an ability to pull well at low speeds. Apart from a filter that needs replacing every 12,000 miles, no up- keep is required and the unit is designed to run for at least 75.000 miles without overhaul. It regulates the quantities of petrol pumped into the engine by an elec- trosics system. Tranducers are fitted ts trials. to the engine to measure the prevail. ing conditions: they supply informa- tion to a cigar box-sized computer which controls the flow of fuel and ensures that precisely the correct amount for most efficient combustion is delivered. This system is claimed by Asso- ciated Engineering to be more accurate than the mechanical metering devices employed on conventional fuel injection.

   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Correspondent Mr. Wilson has been told by the Confederation of British Industry that he, personally, should take over the chairmanship of the National Economic Development Council. Industry's leaders have also renewed their call for the.. I inaustry s eaaers nave also reinstatement of the Chancellor o member of Neddy. The suggestions are aimed at improving the status of the Coun- cil, and preventing it from becom- ing further \"emasculated.\" Management representatives have for some months been com- plaining that Neddy, while still a most useful forum, and one that they would not like to see closed, Is no longer as effective as it once was. Criticisms of this kind were made to Mr. Brown when he was Minister of Economic Affairs, Their repetition now comes at a time when Mr. Michael Stewart has taken over from Mr. Brown, both as Minister and as chairman of Noddy, although this is said to be coincidence rather than design. Mr. John Davies, director-general of the CBI and a member of Neddy, outlined management's views to members of the Confederation Coun. cil at Its monthly meeting in London yesterday. With ;him was Sir Maurlice Laing, the outgoing president and a \" founder member\" of Neddy. Sir Maurice said afterwards: \" Under the previous Administration Neddy mode the plans and resented them to the Government, As a result, It was very much in on the formative stage of things. This Administration regordq plan. ning as the prerogative of the i. it I. a rt e I, d *6 Is n 5. n. a ir Ss n. it lso renewed their call for the.. r of the Exchequer as a permanent M-Ir\"ARFNPS *nowA Ã½436RMGU WOW\"%F8\"X _ _ __ Government, through the Department of Economic Affairs, and we accept its right to act on this view. \"But the net effect is that Neddy has become more a consultative body, which is asked for its opinion when decisions have been made. or virtually made.\" The CIB's line on Neddy is con* sistent with its repeated calls upon the Government to make consulta. tion with industry much more mean. ingful-a plea which was put with emphasis to Mr. Wilson when Con. federation leaders met him at 10. Downing Street. on Monday. Advertising Yesterday's CBI Council mpeting also discussed widespread fears among businessmen that concerted attack may eventually be made on advertising expenditure. ApBrehapsion has been fostered by the Monopolies Commisson's report on detergents, by versions of the contents of the document prepared by the Reith committee at the request of the Labour Party, and by the Minister of Power's Injunctions to the state fuel industries last autumn. The CBI has decided to set up a committee to examine the role of advertising in total mnrketing diture. and to look at marein expenditure as a proportion of toa I ndustrial costs. The committee wil also be asked to expres a philosophy about the value of advertling. Mr. A. J. Stephen Brown, the Confederaton's new president, said that attempts to clarify the Govern. ment's views about dividend payments during the incomes standstill period had failed. He and his colleagues intend to make representations to the Board of Trade about points worrying industry where anti-trust legislation and pro- posed new company laws are con- cerned. They have also decided to urge the Government to adopt Central Euro- pean Time in Britain. to facilitate trade with the Continent. This would mean that British Summer Time would extend throughout the year. Transport Policy A CBI spokesman conirmed last night that Sir Arnold Hall, vice. chairman and managing director of the Hawker Siddeley Group, had with. drawn from the chairmanship of the CBI's new transport working party. The spokesman said Sir Arnold objected to somc Press reports which indicated that the working party was being set up specifically to oppose the policies of the Minister of Transport, Mrs. Barbara Castle, The C08 insisted that this was not. In fact, the case. rather was the objective to survey the field in the widest sense and present \" base guide. lines\" to Mra, Castle In the hope that she would Incorporate them into her overall policy.",

Ford has designed, developed and tested this new unit in Just over 12 months, and during trials at Silver- stone it has already beaten the out- right 1500 cc. Formula I lap record unoifficially.

It will be used in races all over the world next year and will be Britain's sole chal- lenge to the stiff competition to be expected from Germany. Italy and Jipan in Formula II events.

   "text_content" : "The Kirov Giselle, like the Royal h Ballet's but in more direct line, i1 stems from the Petipa production n of the piece staged in St. Peters. burg in the closing years of the century. It is as far from Gauticr's original libretto as all other current productions except Mary v Skeaping's for the Royal Swedes, , and as heedless of the dances' nar- rative and dramatic content But when it is as beautifully danced as it was at Covent Garden last night, and in Petipa terms so stylishly, it prompts reflections on whether we are right to insist-as we have for years, and vainly -that a production of Giselle should transcend the 19th-century Maryinskv conventions. I think we are; but there is some- thing to be said on the other side. t There is no doubt that its original I creators, in 1841, conceived Giselle 1 as a dance-drama. with the acts 4 more closely linked than ever they I are now. In Act 1 Bertha's narra- tion prepares us (and the villagers) for the appearance of the wilis. In I Act 2 village life continues; there are foresters, and drunken villagers I startled by the apparitions; and at the very end Bathilde appears. Giselle's last gesture, before she sinks into the ground, is to wave 1 her lover towards the young duchess with whom she hopes he will find happiness. Giselle has survived while hun- dreds of comparable ballets have disappeared, not only because it has such beautiful choreography, not only because it is supported by Adam's most expressive score, but also because-like Swan Lake and Cinderella-its supernatural story enshrines, gives poetic form to, a human drama. The ballet has its heart in human experience. Most productions of it seek, in i varying degrees, to realise this o human, dramatic element. The I Bolshoy's is probably the most i strongly projected of all. Other 1 companies reinstate now the i huntsmen, now the drunken , peasants; some-but not many-- realise the motivation of Giselle's 1 heartbreaking solo in Act 2, ] which is of course to lure her 4 lover (against her will, but she is compelled by Myrtha's corm mand) from the protective shelter of the cross. Last night's Myrtha, having com- manded the dance, simply walked off-stage until her turn arrived to dance again. Similarly Albrecht went off-stage in mid-drama, until it was time for his solo variation. What would we think of a Mimi who retired into the wings for \"Che gelida manina\", a Rodolfo who did likewise for \"Mi chiamano Mimi \"? Or if you object that La Boh&me is a verismo opera-what then do we think of the Elvira who walks out on Leporello's catalogue area, or the Elvira, Masetto and Zevlina who leave Ottavio to address the imperatives of \" II mio tesoro \" to the empty air? These things happen-but not in truly dramatic, thoughtful productions of Don Giovanni. We could argue that the Petipa Giselle is as formal, as convention-bound a work as a Handel opera seria. and that to present it in any other way than the Kirov's is kin to the Halle practice of staging verismo Handel. We lose the element of form which was part of the creator's intention. I would prefer to claim that Giselle, like Mozart's operas, at once accepts and transcends the conventions of its time, and that without any sacrifice of pure formal beauty, it can also be characterised, and shine the more in a consistent, thoughtfully pro- duced presentation. Last night's production lacked dramatic consistency, but of course the dancing, and the principal dancers, had character. Karsavina in one of her essays, Dolin in his new life of Spessivtseva, both remind us that Giselle, a role which dozens of dancers now seem ready to take in their stride, calls for exceptional technical gifts. Kolpa- kova has them: a wonderful jump; marvellous extension; an open line, free and rapid but never un- controlled; superb balance with which (as also in the Chopiniana Prelude) she can stop and seem to float. Her carriage one could deem perfect, except when a slightly craning inclination of neck and head spoils the ideal line of the image. In the body of a superb techni- cian Giselle's dance sings out more fully, more eloquently, than ever before. To resume the operatic analogy: it is like hearing Amina's music on a voice where every note is pure, where the tone is true at all pitches, dynamics and speeds, and no phrases are smudged, or \" suggested.\" or carried off by some dramatic or declamatory device which can overlay a technical im- perfection. Singers like that are seldom heard now, except on gramophone records. The stars of to-day have other qualities. It is because the Kirov company offers the dance counterpart of those old vocal technicians that one can visit them again and again, for experi- ence of a unique kind. Too much talk of technique sug- gests flashiness; it must be added that there is none of this in the company's style. Virtuosity is never shown off for its own sake (the Kirov Rose Adagio is in interesting contrast to ours). Kolpakova's characterisation was achieved through the dance: the buoyancy and fresh lyricism of Act 1, the raptness, intensity, and concentra- tion on beautifully formed image in Act 2. This attention to image marked all the wilis, with Kurgapkina as their queen, Lvanova and Gruzh- deva as her lieutenants. Who was it said the wilis should \" think evil thoughts \"? These ones, I imagine, thought chiefly about the exact angles composing an arabesque, or the control of a jump; and by realising the choreography so intently they achieved an atmo- sphere of mystery and sinister beauty. Semyenov was the Albrecht, princely, clean, unfailingly courte- ou,s, a real danseur noble. The unusual, and convincing Hilarion of Gridin, and Bolshakova in the peasant pas de deux, Clement Crisp has already praised. The score is none too sensitively played under Victor Shirokov. The sets look like panto stock. It is not the complete Giselle of one's dreams; but as beatutifully danced a Giselle as one could hope to see.",

   "text_content" : "Monteverdi's Orfeo in Ray- mond Leppard's realisation is back at Sadler's Wells for four per- formances, the first of them given last night. Any music-lover worthy of the name should have enough curiosity to want to see Monte- verdi's first opera (1607); anyone who saw Glyndebourne's Poppea will feel impelled to do so. They will be well rewarded. Orfeo is one of .the Wells's positive achieve- ments, musically highly dis- tinguished. and as a production thoughtfully and seriously con- ceived. Once again John Wakefield heroically assumes the long and ex- tremely demanding title-role. His singing is unfailingly musical and at times, as in the song0 immediately before the Messenger's voice is heard off-stage announcing Eury- dice's death, it takes fire. The big scene with Charon demands a brilliance and staying power which few contemporary tenors possess. Wakefield managed this creditably and saved enough to give a most touching account of his lament in the final scene. Altogether the level of singing was encouragingly high. There was no English gentility. Voice after voice sounded meaty, indivi- dual and unmistakeably involved in the music. Patricia Kern must have special mention for the artistry of her singing of the Messenger's part; Noel Mangin and Stafford Dean were both vigorous and sonorous as Charon -and Pluto; among newer names Marie Landis and Georgetta Psaros were outstanding. Frank Hauser deserves high praise for not trying to ape the Baroque splendours of Mantua and for choosin gas his partner Yolande Sonnabend. a real designer, not an interior decorator. Her very personal visual equiva- lent of Monteverdi's textures is most successful in the scene on earth, less so in the rather crowded underworld. Her costumes are effective in the mass, though individually some of them hang too skimpily for the rich effect intended. The final, gauzy apotheosis is a great success. Hansen's groupings are well- composed and flow smoothly. A static impression, given the slow pace of the story, is inevitable.",

   "text_content" : "by B. A. YOUNG uy JO . AM . L wJ L- 11 %j Natasha Pyne and John Shepherd On the strength of Miniatures (given two Sunday performances at the Royal Court last year) and two subsequent one-act pieces, I rec- koned David Cregan the most pro- mising of all the new playwrights we've met recently. His promise remains as bright as ever; Three Men for Colverton crackles with ideas which are presented so as to seem original even when they aren't, and it's full of brightly drawn characters who are no less entertaining for being stereotypes. But Three Men for Colverton is not a bond honoured. It radiates promise; but it isn't a very good play. The ideas flash about like fireflies instead of being concen- trated through the lens of dramatic discipline so that they can be focused on our attention. I don't ask for a neat old-fashioned plot with the goodies living happily ever after while the baddies go to gaol, or to Hell; but I would have liked to know much more clearly what Mr. Cregan regarded as his main target, and which side he was on. His three men are evangelists preaching a new gospel revealed in a vision to their leader, Brother Edward (splendidly played by Malcolm Tierney with a true look of divine calling). Brother Edward, a simple Devonian countryman, believes that Paradise is about to come to earth in the town of Colverton. It will be a friendly, permissive Paradise in which sin will dissolve in a universal bath of goodwill. His two disciples follow him only with difficulty. Brother Dorman wants to go about boost- ing intolerance of sin; he has a long bravura speech against tolera- tion which John Shepherd, who gives the part just the right amalgam of fire and milk, makes creepily convincing. As for poor young Brother Ched (Richard O'Callaghan), he's helplessly queer, all the men in the village are after him, and he loves it in spite of himself. Colverton is ruled by an authoritarian widow, Mrs. Carnock (Sylvia Coleridge-another admir- able performance). The action of the play follows the way in which she manipulates the villagers, arranging a marriage, opposing an art centre, stopping an allowance, so that no change shall ever come to Colverton. But this action is only the armature on which Mr. Cregan hangs his argument; and this, as I say, is scattered broad- side like shot from a shotgun. His attentions are principally devoted to the Church of England. Every vagary of the Established Church is brought out for its share of- ridicule, with the aid of two suitably ridiculous parsons, the Vicar of Colverton (Julian Curry), a South Bank man with a hope of a bishopric, and Father Pym (Richard Simpson), a very high Anglican who imports a confes- sional into the village church. The play is written in a series of very short scenes that usually require a change of scenery. To meet this requirement Christopher Morley has produced a versatile set consisting of a series of small mobile cells that are swiftly pushed on and off, or turned to a different direction, generally by the people who will be acting in them. The director, Desmond O'Donovan, must be congratulated on the extent to which he has kept continuity un- disturbed by this rather trouble- some process, but I found it interrupted my train of thought to an unacceptable extent. In general Mr. O'Donovan has extracted admirable performances from his cast. Besides those I've mentioned. Leonard Sachs is good as the schoolmaster who divides his sexual favours between Ched and a schoolgirl (Natasha Pyne).",

The resources of the city ot 1 Stockholm are many. One can see why the members of the committee jumped at the chance of having the festival here for a second time in ayed decade ISCM isthe Royal Opera House; is what one wants an opera houseo come for to be, red plush and gold and ex- cellar with different acoustics, there is a newrs theatre in the round as well as pub good small and large halls. As a bonus, across the water lies the eighteenth century theatre at Droting their best feet forward wiingholm. The operas given were The Pretenders, by Gunnar Bucht, Herr vofrin Hancken, by K. B. Blomdahl, The Vision of hrthee, by Lars Johan Werle. Gunnar Bucht's Pretenders, an adaptation from an bsen play, a world pre commire, failed to hold one's attention; a decent production, good singing, were apparent, but Orpheus did not arrive to breathe life into the score. Blomdahl's opera, Herr von Hancken, is up-to-date in d6cor. scoring, production: it is concerned with what one is assured is the Swedish \"thing,\" the balance between illusion and reality. It is excessively wordy and one's ignor- ance of Swedish prevents one coming to terms with the work. The music, then? This was subservient to the action and the words, and seemed to be taking place at another remove. The Vision of Thr4ese, though, is a quite remarkable wotk. Its production alone in this new round theatre, holding at most 200, should induce every English opera pro- ducarrive to come across to learn that the new music can lend itself to opera. The story, taken from Zola, concerns a young aristocratic girl, who not knowing her sensual nature plays around with two young men and brings them to their doom. It is told in a series of Swedish , with flash-backs and steps forward in time; the orchestra of 25 players is arranged in the round. The excellent Michael Gielen conducted with authorityds, the singers sang and played vividlyat anothe music sounds right. the whole idea works. The chamer concertse, like the orchestral concerts, were a mixed bag. The various national sections make their choice, the society's jury sifts these out, our cars sift them out still further. What is left? There are hazards to be met. Has one a, conclauded a mildly agreeable one applauded a mildly agreeable work the more simply because it followed a dud? There were dull works, doodlings from private diaries, works which one hides from by reading the programme notes twice, works against which one writes the single word, \" No.\" But we did get some sensitive, poetical works, such as the ' Alveare vernal by Klaus Huber (Switzerland), and Epitaphe by Vittorio Fellagara (Italy) and imaginative ones such as A bion by Moonlight by David Bedford (Great Britain) and Prisme by Per Norgard (Denmark). There were some wonderfully wild compositions that one prays will always crop up at an ISCM festival, such as Kanon by Alfred Janson (Norway) and Diaphonie I by Mauricio Kagel (Independent). The former made a fearful racket with a small group of instruments, a Hammond organ played for- tissimo, saxophone. percussion, pianoforte, double bass, soprano, ' then doubled back on itself on tape: we were a little pleased with ourselves that our ears could pick up the canon. Paul Dessau, veteran of the nineteen twenties, came forward with a piece, Quattrodramma, a fantasia for four 'cellos, two pianos and two percussion players. As one might expect the work had a real edge and flavour to it; a note in the score quotes a Chinese proverb \" You cannot hinder birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can hinder them from building their nests in your hair\" with O'Casey's additional comment \"and I shall wash them right out of my hair.\" The music quotes from Henze and the work is dedicated to him. Bengt Johansson (Finland) set Ezra Pound's The Tomb at Akr Caar impressively. It was a good idea to have three,, works played by twentieth century, veterans, Octandre by Varbse, Gesangsszene by Karl Amadeus Hartmann, and a good selection from the 112 songs for voice and piano by Charles Ives. In the large orchestral works several composers seemed to be playing around like children in a large bath having fun with their plastic toys. Such were Jan W. Morthenson (Sweden) with his Coloratura IV, Ingvar Lidholm (Sweden) with Poesis, specially commissioned by the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Witold Szalonek (Poland) with Les Sons. A solemn piece was Syntagma by Enrique Raxach (Spain), a rum one was \"22 Pages,\" a passage from John Cage's Silence by Joep Strasser (Holland). Michael Gielen (Austria) paid tribute to the Mcssiaen world in his accom- plished setting of a poem by Pablo Nervda, Un Dia Sohrcsale, (com- posers these days have a fine taste in words). Easily the most musical of the large works was Etude III by Jean-Claude Eloy (France). The performance of all this music was a triumph for the Swedish section. Orchestras, choirs, young people ' from academies dived into these fearsome scores determined to show that the new idiom was no world apart.
