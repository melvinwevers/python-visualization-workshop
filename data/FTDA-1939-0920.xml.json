TUESDAY Evening. The British Government declaration to pursue the war to its end despite the Soviet d6marche did nothing to disturb the equanimity of the London Money market. No important changes were made in official exchange quotations with the exception of Swedish kronor. Conditions in Lombard Street were again very comfortable and, in con- sequence, the discount market was not a ready seller of short-dated maturities. The clearing banks maintained their buy- ing rates for October bills at 3 per cent., for November at 3% per cent. and for December at 3% per cent. Business in \" hot\" Treasury bills was reported in out- side quarters at 3> per cent. Leading houses quoted 3% per cent. as their buy- ing rate for three months bank drafts, but the competitive level was scarcely better than 3Y per cent. While the clearing banks held to their minimum rates of 3 and 3% per cent. for loans against bills and bonds respec- tively, borrowers were often able to satisfy their requirements with non-clearing lenders at down to 2Y per cent.

Silver provided the star feature, prices recording further sharp advances to their highest levels since December, 1935. The cash quotation jumped %d to 23'/id per ounce and forward delivery 1/sd to 23%d per ounce. Alterations in official rates of exchange were few and far between, but Swedish kronor appreciated 10 points to 16.80. The U.S. dollar was again called $4.03 middle and the Canadian dollar $4.45. In the \"free\" market, Italian lire hardened to 74%, Rumanian lei to 565, Brazil milreis to 3%d and the Shanghai dollar to 4%d.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 19th Sept. The Stock Market advanced over a wide front following the German Chancellor's speech at Danzig, and closed strong, with net gains of 1 to 8 points. Turnover totalled 1,830,000 shares, against 1,730,000 yesterday. The belief was held that the Danzig speech did not foreshadow any peace offer at present, though it was not overlooked that the. expected domestic fight on the neutrality question, which will begin in Congress on Thursday, might have a further clouding influence on market trends. After a firm opening, the advance broadened out, and a block of 5,000 U.S. Steel Common changed hands $3V up at 74. But business turned dull early in the session, many operators holding aloof pending Herr Hitler's speech at Danzig, while moderate profit-taking reduced the initial gains. Nevertheless, advances ranging to $2 were numerous at midday. Following Herr Hitler's speech all groups participated in a renewed upturn, with war stocks again assuming leadership of the market. Steels were aided by forecasts that mill activity will reach 90 per cent. of capacity before the end of the year, with U.S. Steel and Bethlehem $6 and $7 higher respec- tively .at this juncture. Motors, Chemicals and Rubbers were prominent. Good sup- port was given to Utilities. Rails were also bought, and Rail Equipments re- sponded to expectations of important orders in that field. Trading turned quieter later, but after absorbing profit-taking in its stride the market finished around the day's highs in a strong close. War stocks were buoyant, recording advances of $1 to $8. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing aver- age regained 4.36 at 152.14, Rails 1.38 at 32.19, and Utilities 0.49 at 24.74. Of 866 stocks dealt in, 614 rose, 137 declined and 115 were unchanged. In the Bond market, U.S. Governments were steady and Railroads very firm. Bond sales totalled $10,010,000, against $9,340,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was 169.2, against 167.8 yesterday. - The accelerated forward movement in domestic industry continues, with surveys showing signs of a revival in some of the backward lines, notably coal. Pittsburg steel mills are now ahead of 1937. Congress is not expected to impose excess profits taxes at this session, but is fairly certain to do so next January. Improved business is expected to shrink the Treasury deficit sharply, despite a certain increase in defence outlays. The war is also expected to strengthen the Administration's political status, but, at the same time, gradually to force out the so-called \" Brain Trust\" and its anti- business reform programmes.

   "text_content" : "Members came out of the House in unmistakably more cheerful mood yesterday afternoon than on the previous day. The root cause for the rallying tend- ency of leading Industrials in the late dealings was believed to be the appa- rent completion of forced or semi- forced selling in preparation for to-morrow's special Settlement. A final fillip to sentiment was given by a widespread rumour that the mini- mum prices for gilt-edged stocks were about to be abandoned or substantially lowered. Gilt-edged Unknowns Seemingly, the gilt-edged market itself was the only section to know nothing of the reported intention to strike off its temporary fetters. The general feeling there appeared to be that it would be of little use to attempt to encourage freer dealings until two unknowns are resolved. In the first place there is still a hope that Bank Rate will be reduced to 3 or 31 per cent., if not to-morrow, then in the early future. Secondly, it is thought that any substantial de mand for gilt-edged stocks could hardly be expected this side of the War Budget which Sir John Simon is shortly to present. Industrial Rallies A well-known broker claimed that by the close yesterday it had become harder to buy than to sell popular industrials. The bargain-hunter was evidently on the watch and had taken the morning's cheap stock. Imperial Tobacco, which had been offered at Â£4 17s 6d in the morning, were finally bid for at Â£5. Courtaulds recovered from 25s to 26s and United Molasses from 24s to 25s. Woolworths were bid for at 52s 6d. Troublesome Rules Among the various regulations that may require to be modified or better understood, two instances were brought to my notice yesterday. The first referred to operating in American stocks and the second to the Govern- ment's request for the handing-over of gold coin. As to the first case a broker told me that his bank was refusing to lend on Yankee stocks because of the Treasury's right of requisition. So far as I can gather, the obligation to obtain from the Bank of England per- mission to transfer holdings is not intended to hamper current domestic dealings.-- Pessibly if- the certificates could be endorsed with or accom- panied by a verification of British ownership at the outbreak of war, then authority might be given for free dealings in them in this country. In that event the Treasury's right to re- quisition the stock at some future date would not, it is argued, constitute any serious objection to its use meantime as collateral. Sovereigns Wanted The gold coins mentioned above were several sovereigns which were offered to a branch of one of the \" Big Five\" in accordance with the Treasury leaflet issued on 4th Septem- ber. This particular branch at any rate knew nothing of the leaflet and was prepared to credit the customer with only the old par of 20s each.* Actually H.M. Government has undertaken to pay for gold coin, bullion or specified foreign currencies \"in sterling at the prevailing rate,\" and has ordered that such devisen \"must be offered\" to it \"through your bank.\" The Bank of England's present price for sovereigns is 39s 3d each. There has been some surprise that more of the coins have not been forced out of hoard since the Government order. Maybe if it were made simpler for people in the provinces to sell the coins at, say, any post office at 39s 3d, the flow to the Treasury might be swollen. Branch banks should also be instructed of the position by their head offices. hit BDarite",

   "text_content" : "TUESDAY Evening. Although values declined on balance, Stock Exchange experience to-day was a little more encouraging. Prices in some markets, at least, had a steadier appearance at the close. The slight improvement in tone, most evident in quotations for leading Industrials, was attributed to the belief that the fixed minimum prices in the gilt-edged market are to be adjusted. Signs of a completion of selling connected with Thursday's Settlement contributed to the more cheerful atmosphere. Turnover in general showed no improve- ment, and in some markets an actual decline was reported. The total of trans- actions recorded in all markets was 2,104, compared with 2,460 yesterday. Nothing occurred to increase business in the gilt-edged section, where dealings were done at and fractionally above the minimum prices. A further drying up of business, due to the difficulty of finding buyers, showed that the minima are con- stantly becoming less effective, and emphasised the need for breaking the deadlock they involve. Judged on the number of official mark- ings, 4% per cent. Conversion Loan remained the most active among British Government securities, transactions rang- ing from the fixed price of 100% up to 101. Dealings in Corporation stocks, where they were recorded at all, were at the minima and about % higher. Most markings in Dominion stocks were actually at the minimum figures. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 BONDS CONTINUE WEAK Business in the Foreign bond market con- tinued to be a question of finding buyers and negotiating terms. The announce- ment of the default on the Dawes Loan had been fully anticipated by the market and there was no further lowering of the quota- tion. The general weakness of prices was shown by the fall in quotations of South American countries, such as Brazil and the Argentine. Brazil 4 per cent. 1889, for example, closed 3 points lower at 66 and the 6% per cent. issue was marked down 1% to 12%. Argentine 4 per cent. 1933 met with a little selling and lost 1 point to 80, while the 4% per cent. Conversion issue dropped 2 to 75. The easy tendency of Far Eastern bonds continued. Chinese 4% 1898 lost a further 2 points to 43 and the 5 per cent. 1913 issue were 1 point off at 29. Japanese 5% pc Conversion sustained a fall of 4 points to 38 and the 6 per cent. 1924 issue closed 3 points down at 36. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 ALL RAILS DULL Activity in the Home Rail marketdeclined further. All prior charges were quoted very close to the unofficial minima still ruling in the market, _ut buyers remained very difficult to find even at a fraction of a point above these levels. Deals were rare, although the jobber's turn on such business as there was remained relatively small. The hearing of the railway unions' wage claims by the Railway Staff Tribunal, which began at Euston to-day, was not a market factor, although it is expected that the findings of the Tribunal will have an important bearing on the Government com- pensation offered for the use of railways during the war. Selling pressure on the Ordinary stocks appeared to have abated somewhat, and, although some small losses were recorded, they were smaller and less numerous than previously. Thus Great Western shed % to 21% and L.M.S. were % off at 10%, while other issues remained unchanged. In the Foreign Rail list prices eased slightly in a very poor market. Argen- tines again failed to attract renewed buy- ing interest and quotations lost fractions in several cases. B.A.G.S. Ordinary dropped % to 8% and B.A. and Pacific also lost % to 3%. American Rails followed the weak lead of the overnight market on Wall Street and although little stock changed hands quotations were lowered. New York Cen- tral were % down at 21% and Pennsyl- vania and Southern were each a full point lower at 26% and 19%. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS AGAIN SOLD Better Tendency in Leaders Towards Finish Industrials again pursued an unsatis- factory course, but during the afternoon small rallies occurred among leading shares. This was attributed to the presence of a few buyers on the look-out for cheap stock, and to the growing belief that the ininima gilt-edge prices are to be revised. The opening was dull with fresh weakness in many directions when it became apparent that small sellers again were about. Although prices in several instances finished above the lowest, the close of business saw quite a string of further small losses. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 83.4 against 84.1 on Monday. In the BANKING section the selling was comparatively light. Lloyds receded 2s 6d to 40s and Martins fully paid % to 3%. Bank of Australasia and Union of Aus- tralia were each % lower. The downward movement in INSURANCE issues contirnued and Prudential \"A\" fell 3% to 21% and the \" B \" shares 8s 6d to 52s 6d. The dulness of the ELECTRIC POWER group., was relieved by fresh inquiry for Perak River Powers which were marked up Is 3d to 16s 9d.: County of London Electrics were dealt in at 27s 6d and City of London at 26s. Northmets were Is down at 32s 6d and British Powers 9d lower at 23s. Gas Light and Coke were lowered Is 6d to 15s 6d. ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT issues were still unsteady as a result of small sales but in some instances buyers were about and General Electrics UiRSeaucu \"u' uow w11u t IUIIjUII Far- kinsons rallied 9d to 12s. Realisations depressed MOTORs. Ley- lands and Albions shed 2s 6d apiece and Tillings were Is 6d lower, while Dennis were down Is 3d. Leading AIRCRAFTS were flat, particularly Handley Page 3s 6d down at 15s. although there was no indica- tion of selling pressure. On the other hand, sales of Hawker Siddeley were in progress and the shares closed Is 1%d weaker at 9s 4%d. De Havillands were 2s 6d lower at 82s 6d on some offering. Dunlops changed down to 23s 3d and Triplex Glass were lowered %. to 1%. Raleigh Holdings reacted 2s to 44s. Atkinson-Oates on the final of 10 per cent., making 20 per cent. for the year, were called, 7s 6d. SHIPPING descriptions were reactionary with losses of % to 6 in Clans and Is 3d to 20s 6d in Furness Withy. In IRON AND STEEL, United Steels rallied to 20s on the dividend; otherwise the trend was adverse. ,cwarts and Lloyds weaKeneu anew s to 38s 6d. In ENGINEERING, Westinghouse Brakes weakened to 40s. Pressed Steels changed at 12s 6d and closed 13s. Imperial Chemi- cals continued dull, being 26s 3d, while British Oxygens were 'e off at 3\"VA and Murex % easier also at 3'\",,. Turner and Newall sagged to 3%. Pinchin Johnsons were weak around 19s and British Plaster Boards 2s down at 23s. Among TEXTILES the undertone re- mained weak. As an exception English Sewing Cottons were firmer at 25s 3d. Coats were down 9d to 24s. RAYONS finished above worst. Courtaulds were flat in the early dealings and offered at 25s, but at the end they were buyers at 25s 9d. British Celanese Second Prefer- ence, after realising 7s 9d, finished at 9s. Few changes of consequence occurred among STORES. Marks and Spencer and Great Universals were down. Among FOODSTUFFS, Home and Colonials and Maypole Dairy were on the easy side and Smith's Crisps Is lower. Some of the TOBACCO shares closed buyers above the day's lowest levels. This was the case with Imperials, which dipped to 4% and left off at 5 bid. Likewise, British Americans changed at 76s 3d at one time and closed buyers at 80s. In the BREWERY group, Ind Coopes rallied %, to 3% and City of London De- ferred 6d to 5s. Falls were fairly general and Bushell Watkins were down 8s 9d to 67s 6d. Among NEWSPAPER, ENTERTAINMENT and LAND shares numerous small reces- sions were recorded. Dollar issues tended to improve during the day. U.S. Steels were 86, Bethlehems 103, Nickels 50, General Motors 61% and Chryslers 102. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS EASIER There was again only a small amount of business in the Rubber share market. Rubbers may have considerable possibili- ties, but fears of heavy taxation in the forthcoming supplementary Budget were said to-day to be a deterrent to purchasers. In the absence of activity jobbers marked quotations lower. One bright ex- ception was provided by an investment order for Tamiang, which r2tised the price from 20s to 20s 6d. Declines in prices generally were not heavy, though Braun- ston came on offer and lost Is 3d to 12s 6d. Labu shed the same amount at 36s 3d, while Is was taken from Djasinga to 11s 3d and Sapong to 19s 6d. Conditions in the share market in the \"Lane\" were also quiet again. Rubber Trust were 27s 6d, and there were sellers of Anglo-Dutch at 26s 6d. Tea shares on the Stock Exchange were offered occasionally, and quotations were lower where altered. Jas. Finlay changed hands at 45s, and remained on offer at that price at the close. Rubber and Tea Share Prices Page 4 NARROW OIL CHANGES Apart from rather sharp declines in a few of the Preference stocks, movements in the OIL market were narrow. Yester- day's downward movement was checked and in a few cases prices made some show of recovering their declines, but on balance changes were not of much importance. Trinidad Leaseholds remained at their reduced level of 4',., but Apex at 28s 6d and Trinidad Petroleum Developments at 50s 6d both rallied 6d. Trinidad Centrals, in which little interest has been shown of late, were dealt in a number of times be- tween 7s ld and 7s 6d and closed 6d to the good at the latter price. Offering on Amsterdam account and technical considerations resulted in a loss of a point in Royal Dutch to 39. Shells were inclined to harden at 4%'/ at one time, but they finished unchanged at 4'%2. Burmahs were %, better at 3'%, and Anglo-Iranians steady at 3 ,. Mexican Eagles at 4s 9d and Canadians at 8s 9d both were 3d off. Oil Share Prices Page 4 MINES CLOSE STEADIER Tins Remain Firm-Venterspost and West Wits. Up Apart from Tin shares, Mining markets remained dull with price movements on the day again mostly downwards There was, however, a steadier tendency towards the close, a little bargain hunting causing some quotations to finish above the worst. As yesterday, Kaffirs opened under the adverse influence of lower prices cabled from Johannesburg. Stock was still com- ing in, but dealers reported a lessening of the pressure to sell, and the existence of some demand at the sharply reduced levels recently reached. Venterspost, for in- stance, were supported on a sufficient scale to cause a recovery of %, on balance to 1\"/32. West Wits. also gained Y to 2%, after 2%, and Western Holdings 6d to 7s 6d, after being offered at 6s 10%d from the Cape. On the other hand, a number of the pro- ducers registered fresh falls ranging up to % in Sub Nigel and Geduld. Among Finance issues, Anglo American were again particularly depressed,dropping to 1%. Gold Fields receded % to 23/,,. West Africans were dull, but offering proved rarely important in amount. A good development cable from Ashanti failed to find reflection in the shares, which weakened ., to 3%. Gold Coast Selection lost %, to \"%'. Of other Gold shares, Oriental Consolidated were firm and fairly active, changing hands up to 2%. Westralians were little changed. Among Indians, Champion Reef gave way %' to 2'/ and Nundydroog %s, to 1lA. Rhodesian Coppers tended to leave off above the worst, but still down on balance, although Rhodesian Anglo-American were finally unchanged at 23s, after 22s 6d. Rhokana fell 4 to 12, after 11%, and Nchanga % to 1%. Other net declines did not exceed 3d. Among other Coppers, Rio Tinto dropped another % to 11. Buying orders for Tin shares were still being received from Eastern sources under the influence of the 100 per cent. output quota just announced. Southern Tronoh gained '% to %,, as did Killinghall to %. Malayan, Southern Malayan and Ayer Hitam all hardened Â½.. On the other hand, Mawchi were lowered '/ to 1%. Mining Share Prices Page 4 S",

   "text_content" : "Action may be taken to-day in connection with the conflict of opinion now going on around the fixation of minimum prices in the Consol market. The Stock Exchange Committee were asked the other day to defer discus- sion of the subject, in view of the fact that it was under consideration by the Treasury. Meanwhile, its incidence bears heavily upon Stock Exchange business and prices alike. It plays into the hands of bears, some of whom can- didly admit they have no intention of repurchasing until the minimum prices in the Consol market are reduced. It affords convenient cover for the quotation of abnormally wide prices. It practically compels the man who requires money to sell what- ever is realisable for what price he can get. Seventy Million Pounds In the course of the last few days, to take only three shares, Imperial Tobacco, British-American Tobacco and Woolworths, the depreciation which has occurred is equal to the combined nominal share capital in Ordinary shares of the three com- panies-not far short of seventy million pounds. The depreciation is due, not entirely, but largely, to the fact of there being minimum prices in the Consol market. From to-day's lists, it will be noticed that various Insurance shares are flat; another testimony to the malinfluence of the minimum price principle. The lowering by a point apiece of the three stocks, War Loan, Con- version Three and a-Half per Cents. and Consol Fours would entail a depreciation of thirty million pounds. Slightly Harder In most of the markets there was a slightly less depressed tendency at the close of business yesterday afternoon. While little more than a tendency, the tone showed rather more resistance to the weakness apparent on Monday. With no fresh news to give them a lead, Stock Exchange markets were content to mark time and, apparently under the impression that the fall had proceeded sufficiently far, a trifle of buying after lunch introduced a slightly firmer tendency in certain departments. Switchback Markets As the war develops, the St -k Exchange will see a good deal of tais sort of thing: days upon which it will be extrenlely difficult to realise any- thing; other days upon which-if the previous war experience is anything to go by-receipt of cheerful news from one or other of the fronts will render prices more flexible. South African Industrials In only a few cases have South African Industrial shares claimed respect from the investor on this side. They have been regarded, as a whole, as being more or less speculative. It will be a strange freak of fortune if limitation of gold-mining profits should spell a corresponding improve- ment in the status of South African Industrials. Yet any strengthening of the Union of South Africa credit could hardly fail of oblique reflection in the standing of the Colony's Industrials. The gold mines' poison might prove the industrial companies' meat after all. Clearing House for Money Current conditions are eminently suited for the introduction into Stock Exchange machinery of a plan for the settlement of cash, as well as of shares, between members of the House. The Settlement Department proves every fortnight how invaluably its machinery works. In days past, the suggestion has been put forward here that the methods of the Clearing House could be applied to the adjustment of differences, and to payments for stock, without the labor- ious paraphernalia of drawing and paying-in cheques. Difficulties in regard to liability should not prove insuperable. With the energetic control now in charge of the Stock Exchange Clearing House, a start could be made in a direction which would save a large expenditure of work and office expenses. Autoiygru",

   "text_content" : "There was reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday an official memorandum concerning the Govern- ment scheme for the compulsory insur- ance of stocks of commodities against war risks. The statement was at once an indication that the burden of the premiums in some instances has been regarded too seriously and an accusa- tion that certain sections of traders have taken undue advantage of the levy. It did not deal with the in- equities inherent in a plan which levies a flat 6 per cent. on stocks irre- spective of the degree of risk involved (so far as the country can be divided into vulnerable areas and the rest). The point on which stress was chiefly laid was that the 6 per cent. is charge- able on the stocks held at one time. In other words, the real weight of the burden depends upon the rapidity of turnover. If stocks are turned over several times a year, as they will be in many instances, it is flagrantly un- justifiable to sdd the full 6 per cent. to the price of each consignment of goods, since that would mean recoup- ing the cost of the insurance several times over. So far, the official case is made good, but it must be remembered that the premium is payable not merely on the production of a finished article but perhaps at each of several stages of manufacture. The effect upon ultimate prices therefore will be substantial in any event, and there is every reason for stringent precautions-to be taken by the authorities if trade associations cannot act effectively-to ensure that unavoidable additions shall not be unnecessarily multiplied to the detri- ment of the public. When that has been said, there still remain fundamental questions of principle which are highly controversial. Some of the most valu- able stocks, some forms of jewellery and gold plate, for instance, will have a slow rate of turnover but a high value. They will bear a burden almost of the full rate of premium, therefore, and although in case of loss they would call forth a corresponding payment, the immediate charge will be exceptionally heavy in such a case. That is one of the directions in which the combination of compulsion and what seems a heavy premium is cer- tainly very burdensome, especially to owners outside \"danger\" areas. Whether it would be desirable to revert to a voluntary system at this late stage would need very close consideration, particularly from the standpoint of financial feasibility. At the outset, at any rate, such a system would have had some distinct advantages, and it would have been more nearly in accord with the principle of national risk which underlay the Government's initial approach to the question of compensa- tion for damage to property. Another point which definitely needs revision is the obligation to insure goods sold on hire purchase, widely distributed though these are and therefore subject to a minimum of danger. Fortunately the authorities concerned are not opposing complete rigidity to the many complaints which the scheme has evoked. Minor relaxations, in regard to erroneous declarations and to certain agricultural products, were recorded in THE FINANCIAL TIMES a week ago, and it may be expected that longer experi- ence and time for consideration of this entirely new departure will lead to further modifications other than the variation of the rate of which the possibility has been already fore- shadowed. The advisory committee suggested by the Multiple Shops Fed- eration could give very valuable help in an examination of the scheme and the criticisms it has encountered.",

   "text_content" : "The reduction in the total dividend of the United Steel Companies from 10 to 8 per cent. was not unexpected. The interim was cut in February from 3 to 21 per cent., and now the final is 5j, against 7 per cent. In January the company subscribed for 1,288,200 \"A\" shares in John Summers, as part of the scheme to assist the latter put through by the Bankers Industrial Development Company. To finance this association with John Summers and to augment general resources United Steel had previously issued 882,200 new Ordinary shares and Â£1,500,000 Four and a-Half per Cent. Ten-Year notes. The first interest payment on the notes fell due in the middle of June, and the new Ordinary shares rank, of course, for dividend. But it does not appear likely that any return has yet been received on the Summers invest- ment. This, together with the hesitancy shown by the steel industry in the latter part of 1938, is sufficient to explain the directors' present con- servatism. It seems probable that the actual profit figure will show an in- crease. The Ordinary shares stand at 20s.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Silver, as one of the few really \"free \" markets, has been providing plenty of interest of late. Prices yesterday reached their highest levels for nearly four years. For all that the market remained largely nominal because of the diffi- culty of doing business. Buyers were active, but sellers were absent, London stocks having been reduced to almost negligible propor- tions. Busy Bears Leading brokers report that, so far, little metal has been attracted to the market. Doubts are expressed whence supplies will emanate. Normally current prices, which are well above dollar parity, would have attracted shipments from America but New York shippers require the exchange before they will despatch the metal. Owing to the new regula- tions such exchange might not be forthcoming; hence the absence of shipments. The stimulus derived from the adjustment of sterling in terms of the dollar spent itself days ago, but de- mand has increased. Bears have been notably active, these speculators hav- ing to face maturing positions which they had carried forward last June when they expected a break in the price. Now they have to pay the price. Hoarding demand is also on the in- crease while, yesterday, there was general buying. Exchange Dodges Authorised foreign exchange dealers report that they are faced with all sorts of devices from operators anxious to get dollars \" cheap\" in London and sell them \" dear\" in New York owing to the wide gap between the official rate here and the \" black\" market quotation in America. Ameri- can banks are notably active in this respect. It is also stated that there has been a strange increase in the number of beneficiaries under wills, deeds of settlement and so on. Genuine cases go through but the doubtful applicants for exchange are now called upon to provide affidavits or other concrete evidence. Statements that persons in this country can send sterling abroad easily by simply declaring on Form E.1 that the transaction does not in- fringe the exchange regulations are incorrect. Unless the exchange is re- quired for the purposes laid down in para. 2 of the instructions to banks and dealers the matter is referred to the authoritios. dividend of 10 per cent., which is paid for the third year in succession. A sum of Â£60,500 is put to reserve, against Â£30,000, bringing the total to Â£147,000. EASTWOODS The reduced profit and dividend of Eastwoods was not due to any falling off in the company's trade. This was revealed by Mr. Horace Boot at the meeting yesterday. Actually, the company transacted a larger trade. Sales of cement, bricks and other building materials were all substanti- ally increased, but selling prices have not been maintained. In the case of cement they were adjusted by the Federation anfd in the case of bricks they have been affected by external competition. The lower prices have cut profit margins at a time of higher taxation and ..orking costs. At present .the company is handi- capped by the commandeering of motor vehicles, but the Chairman was not disposed to look on the dark side when discussing the future. He an- ticipates a continued heavy demand for bricks and cement and all building materials for construction work for the forces and large orders are ex- pected from expansion of production in the heavy industries and munition works.",

This is not unexpected in view of the fact that, while the gold-mining industry has maintained its develop- ient, a large number of secondary industries in South Africa have felt the effects of the international reces- sion. As one of the principal im- porters and distributors in the Union, the company has also experienced difficult competitive conditions. Speaking at the last meeting, Mr. Atkinson complained that price- cutting had made severe inroads on profits. It is possible that the war may ease the situation in one respect in that subsidised German competition will now be excluded, though what effect the war itself will have upon the general demand for motor-cars remains to be seen. The 5s Ordinary are priced at 7s 6d cum dividend to give a yield of around 14 per cent.",

Practically all the Ordinary capital is owned by Godfrey Phillips and direct public interest in the com- pany is, therefore, confined to the Preference shares.

Teleurams: \" Finantimo, Are., London.\" C. B.-Grand Union Canal Six per Cent. Pre- ference stock is quoted 45-50. It was last dealt in at 541 on 25th May last. Chittenham-1. Interest payments should be maintained and the shares may be regarded as a good investment. 2. All these stand at rubbish prices and it is useless to attempt to sell any of them now. 3. Better wait. Divi-It seems very unlikely that North Broken Hill will not be allowed the requisite exchange to remit dividends declared to English resident shareholders. It has already been stated that the relatively large sterling requirements of the Australian gold com- panies will not be unduly restricted. Ercs-We would prefer the shares of an actual producing mine to those of a finance concern. Suggest Ashanti or Ariston. F. M.-So far as we are aware no further steps have been taken in the matter and in view of the change in conditions it is likely to remain in abeyance for some time. Jap-We do not think there is any doubt as to the soundness of societies such as those referred to and in our opinion you will be well advised to leave the money where it is. L. L., Wantage-1. The shares fell on the re- duction in the dividend. It is a sound com- pany and we do not think you should sell now. 2. No Ordinary dividend was paid this year and we are afraid the outlook for the concern is poor. 3. We doubt if these could be sold at the present time and you can only hold and await events. Monopoly-You do not state which coupon your bank has been unable to cash, but your best course would be to write direct to the paying agents, Messrs. Lazard Brothers and Co., Ltd., 11, Old Broad-street, E.C., and put before them the facts. Romanic-If your holding is at all substantial we would be inclined to scale it down at the first favourable opportunity. Simplicitas-Both are sound companies and we do not think you should attempt to sell either of the shares at the present time. Wednesday-In view of the rise in Bank Rate and having regard to general con- ditions we do not consider the charges excessive and see no ground on which you can complain. Xosa-No, but it should be approaching com- pletion. The scheduled date is about the end of next month.",

   "text_content" : "Industrial shares improved yesterday on rumours that gilt- edged minimum prices were to be revised immediately. Inquiries made by THE FINANCIAL TIMES elicited the in- formation that, although no decision had been reached, the question is being considered by the Committee. For some days the growing need for some ameliorative action has been apparent. At the levels fixed on 24th August it has become virtually impossible for holders of gilt-edged issues to disnnos of their s.cmrities. dispose of their securities. This has led not only to stalemate in the gilt-edged market but more recently to forced selling of Industrials to pro- vide ready money and to place holders in funds to meet maturing pre-war obligations falling due at to-morrow's Settlement. The selling of Industrials became accentuated on Monday last when heavy falls occurred in practically every section of the market. The rumoured imminence of a down- ward revision of gilt-edged minima, which should result in the unfreezing of the market, relieved pressure yesterday on Industrials, and a general improvement in tone occurred towards the close of dealings. Minimum prices for gilt-edged securities were fixed by the Committee on 24th August last in response to a request from dealers. On the same day Bank Rate was raised from 2 to 4 Der cent. Transactions took place around the minima for several days and then an up- ward turn was experienced. This was attributed to bear covering. On the reopening of the House on 6th September last, gilt-edged prices were marked down to the minimum levels. BANK RATE INFLUENCE Reduction Talk It was thought up to last Thursday that the gilt-edged market deadlock would be broken by a reduction in Bank Rate. Disappointment at the absence of a fall had an unfavourable effect on the market, and was responsible for a further drying- up of business. Apart from this effect, the maintenance of the 4 per cent. Bank Rate -has been severely criticised by Stock Ex- change members as well as in other City quarters. The market is now suggesting that adjustment of the minimum quotations for gilt-edged stocks may be accompanied by a cut in Bank Rate to-morrow, the normal day for making changes. Bank Rate reduction talk also persists in the Money market, and was responsible yesterday for an easy tendency in bill rates.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Consideration by the Ottawa Govern- ment of the practicability of constructing a pipeline to carry oil across Canada'from the Alberta oilfield to Lake Superior has not been checked by the war. Investiga- tions by experts of various technical aspects of the scheme are expected to be the subject of a report to the Dominion Government next month. The cost of laying the pipeline, as was stated in a special article in THE FINANCIAL TIMEs on 26th July, was esti- mated to be between Â£6,000,000 and Â£7,000,000. On a wartime price basis this cost would probably be exceeded. Original plans for finding part of the finance in this country would also have to be revised if it should be decided to proceed with con- struction of the line."

The problem of rising prices was also discussed by the committee and the opinion was very strongly expressed that in the pational interest traders should make a resolute concerted effort to keep prices down.

Clause 3 has been altered to read as follows (the change is the addition of the words in italics):- 3. In the case of transactions entered into after 26th August, 1939, securities to which the order relates will only be good delivery if accompanied by the relative \" Registra- tion Certificate for Transfers \" (Form S2) stamped by the Bank of England, except where securities are bought for shipment abroad. The following paragraph (4) has also been added:- 4. Where securities are bought for ship- ment abroad the application for authorisa- tion of the transaction must be made to the Bank of England or the Committee of the Stock Exchange on the appropriate forms and accompanied by Forms S1 (A), S1 (B) or S2 as is therein mentioned. AMENDMENTS REQUESTED Yesterday the Stock Exchange was still without a reply from the Bank of England requesting amendments to the list of securities considered to be affected by the Treasury's restriction on dealings in certain foreign stocks. The suggestion is that Russian and Mexican securities should be removed in order to eliminate the vast amount of work involved in the filling up of forms. Steps are also being taken to ascertain whether Mexican Eagle shares should be included in the list. Reference has to be made to official documents regarding the centres at which dividends are payable. As the company's offices are in Mexico in- quiries have to be addressed to the London financial agents, the Whitehall Securities Corporation. Delay in receiving a reply is due to the fact that the corporation has moved to a temporary address in the country.",

Of four committees set up, one will deal with production generally and Govern- ment supplies, others wi-th raw cotton sup- plies, export trade, and essential commodi- ties. The last-named will consider the problem of the demands of the industry for materials other than cotton. SIR PERCY ASHLEY, the chairman, stated after the meeting that the industry's task was the provision in the most efficient, ex- peditious and economical way possible of all Government requirements and supplies needed not merely for the fighting services but also for the second line of home de- fence; secondly, the maintenance and, if possible, development of export trade. The purpose of the Board was to guide and co-ordinate the activities of the trade with those two objectives in view.

   "text_content" : "By our INDUSTRIAL CORRESPONDENT Active steps are being taken by British manufacturers to ensure that, despite the demand for armaments, export trade shall not be interfered with unduly. It is the declared intention of the Government that exports should be maintained and if possible increased. To this end plans are being drawn up by British traders to meet the new conditions. Machinery has been set up for the pooling of export inquiries. By this means when an order is received by an undertaking unable to fill it, it will be passed on to one which can do so. Although traders are faced with a heavy demand for armament manufactures, which in some cases is occupying to capacity their available manufacturing re- sources, they are endeavouring to devise means whereby a part of their productive capacity may be kept available for export business. One means by which pressure may be relieved is by the pooling of over- seas inquiries and co-operative effort among industrialists. In conversation with a representative of THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, one prominent manufacturer urged the need for a clear lead from the Government as to the policy it intended to pursue in regard to export credit facilities. \" We have just heard,\" he said, \" that in one neutral country which has called for tenders for capital goods valued at some Â£2,000,000, representatives of foreign competing manufacturers have declared their willingness to tender and their ability to guarantee delivery. We have not been able to put in tenders because we are not sure whether we shall he able to carry out the work.\" GOVERNMENT'S POLICY The Board of Trade is working in close contact with the Ministry of Economic Warfare with a view to assisting the export trade. Although precedence must be given defence considerations, it is felt Government Departments will give con- sideration to exporting difficulties on the merits of each case. The Board of Trade has recently helped and will continue to assist in individual cases, recognising that it is essential to encourage exporters to carry on business which will help to pay the cost of the war. Exports to a country which would not in return produce, for instance, dollar ex- change would have little hope of assist- ance. On the other hand, exports of luxury articles not required at home to countries which can afford to pay for them will be facilitated. RE-EXPORT OF CLOTH Discussions are taking place in official trade circles with a view to preventing the re-export of Lancashire cotton goods through neutral countries to Germany. It is recognised that safeguards may be necessary to prevent cloth being resold to the enemy. Where shipments of heavier goods become abnormally large it is thought that it may be advisable to request the Board of Trade to introduce a system of export licenses, as has been done in the case of cotton yarns, to certain countries.",

   "text_content" : "Once again there were few material changes in the official rates quoted in the foreign exchange market yesterday, and main interest was therefore in the move- ments of the pound in free foreign centres. Initial advices from New York indicated that the opening rate there was $3.90%, compared with $3.75 at one time on Monday, and the closing level on that day of $3.83.%. The final rate yesterday was $3.91%, a net advance of 7%c. According to leading authorised dealers, neutral sterling balances are not entirely blocked, and they aver that if permission has not been granted for their disposal, then there is good reason for it in most cases. Certain interests try all manner of devices in an effort to obtain foreign ex- change, the whole object being to get dollars cheaply in London and sell them at several points profit in New York. As long as there is a wide gap between London official rates and the \"black market\" quotation, attempts will be made to take advantage of it. The gap should gradually close as the offering of sterling balances immobilised in London slackens. Suggestions that British exporters should invoice in foreign currencies do not find favour in many directions for a variety of reasons. Once such a system was introduced a return to the normal would be difficult. Furthermore, it is not a simple matter, as has been suggested, to send sterling out of this country by merely making a declaration on Form E.1 that the transaction does not infringe the exchange regulations. The London silver market yesterday again provided a feature, the spot price rising %7d to 23',,d per ounce, and for- ward delivery ',.d to 23Rd. These are the highest levels since December, 1935.

   "text_content" : "MAINTAINING ESSENTIAL SERVICES The nineteenth ordinary general meet- ing of Eastwoods, Ltd., was held yesterday at River Plate House, Finsbury-circus, E.C. MR. HORACE BOOT, M.Inst.C.E., M.I.Mech.E, M.I.E.E. (chairman and managing director), who presided, said: We meet under the shadow of the national emergency, and I shall not detain you with a long speech. Freehold properties and fixed assets, etc., show some slight reduc- tion at Â£213,321, after providing for depre- ciation, etc. The additions to properties are important. We have purchased another sand and gravel property at Runfold, near Farnham, in Surrey, and ex- penditure has also been incurred on equip- ment for new depots in East Anglia. Stock at Â£137,611 shows an increase of about Â£7,000 due to considerable expan- sion of turnover. We are now carrying stocks at depots in the Eastern Counties which were not running last year. The expansion of debtors at Â£211,399 is again due to increased turnover as well as to the longer credit taken by customers during the present financial stringency. Your directors are, of course, extremely disappointed at the net profit decrease. The lower revenue is reflected consistently throughout all departments. Various economies were put into operation immedi- ately it was known that the profits were likely to show some recession. The new depots and branches have not yet reached the earning stage, and con- siderable expenditure incurred in develop- ing the new areas has been fully dealt with. The large increase in motor vehicles has necessitated provision for deprecia- tion on a higher scale than before. The volume of our trade has increased. This involved the sale of much larger quantities of bricks and building materials, and there is a substantial increase in cement sales. In brick circles generally, although prices cannot be said to have been actually uneconomical, profit margins have been reduced when we are already suffering from the effects of higher taxa- tion and working costs. The coal merchanting trade continues to be restricted by the control which limits the merchants' sphere of operations. Sand and gravel prices have stood at a very low level, and a number of pits have experienced adverse trading conditions. The present demand for A.R.P. purposes has been of some assistance, but transport difficulties are accentuated, and those firms whose fleets were most efficient are naturally the most hardly hit. With the war only a few days old, I find it difficult to forecast the future trends of industry. We must anticipate a continued heavy demand for bricks and cement and building materials. Naval, military and Air Force construction must go on at an accelerated pace, and large orders are expected from expansion of production in all heavy industries and in munition works and mechanised processes of every descrip- tion. Evacuation schemes, too, under which immense numbers of the civil popu- lation will need to be rehoused, and children educated in the reception areas, should all lead to increased demand for rehousing and reschooling. It will be our policy to run our works at full output, and to maintain all essential services consistent with Government de- mands for men and transport, and with the limited means of production and dis- tribution at our disposal. The report was adopted and the final dividend of 3 per cent., making 8 per cent. for the year, was approved. The Chairman, replying to a vote of thanks, mentioned that the volume of busi- ness during the current period showed an expansion of 20 per cent. He drew atten- tion to the urgent need for economy in public expenditure, having regard to the fact that the burden of increased taxa- tion would necessarily fall directly on industry.",

   "text_content" : "The claims of the three railway unions for better pay and conditions came before the Railway Staff National Tribunal in London yesterday. The hearing will be resumed to-day and is expected to be con- cluded by to-morrow, after which the Tribunal will consider its findings. Mr. John Marchbank, general secretary of the N.U.R., which is asking that the minimum wage recently raised from 41s to 45s a week should be further increased to 50s, said the union regarded the 50s minimum as paramount. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the Railway Clerks' Association also submitted their case. Mr. G. L. Darbyshire, chief labour and establishment officer of the L.M.S., reply- ing for the railway companies, pointed out that the outbreak of war made it impossible to offer up-to-date evidence about the railways' financial position. He declared that because of the cost and the fact that traffic receipts had not yet fully recovered, the companies could not agree to the men's claims.",
